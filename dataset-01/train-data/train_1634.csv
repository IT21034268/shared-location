4,cute and fun for the whole family...,"Tony Curtis races vintage cars around Monte Carlo in a funny follow-up to ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"".Cute moments for Terry-Thomas and Gert Frobe."
1,nurbsturbation,"hmmm,most of the work in this book is non-sensical proposals for big name companies, like Rashid wants to be a high flying designer, but can't quite design the mass-appeal product. Designing a blobject MD player for Sony without buttons is all well and good in 3D studio Max, but what happens when it comes to usability testing and manufacture...I don't like his work, it looks like a university product design portfolio, the text is unreadable at odd angles, and he treats the reader with patronising pseudo-sociological [person]."
1,flub and dribble,"Not only should you not buy this book you shouldnt even open it.Karim Rashid deserves great credit for his ability to fool corporations and college freshmen into buying into his vision of a hot pink world but as far as design goes, he is a joke, his ""look"" was over in 1995 six months after it started. Anyone with a 3d modeling program on there home computer could produce this work. Take a shape, close your eyes, punch some keys on your computer, color it purple, call it a vase,lamp,chair,whatever and voila the Karim Rashid formula. The entire book almost is made not of photos but of computer generated images, this stuff doesnt even exist(thank God). He needs to go back to Canada or Egypt, repurchase the 40,000 records he supposidly ""threw in the trash"" and pick up his gig as the DJ he really is and leave the designing to the designers. Shame on the ignorant people out there who cant see the Emperor is naked."
4,"He's, like, the Prophet Of A New And Better Way of Life","Refreshing, weird, interesting, strong,thoughtful, not hokey.People should let Karim do whatever he wants."
3,"Good compendium, not for learning","I found this book useful when TEACHING a course on ultrasonics, but I would never use it as a classroom text or as reference from which to learn on your own. The reasoning behind this is that the book quite simply covers too many topics to go into details. It therefore provides only a summary of results and applications, and rarely delves into the details of derivations or the intricacies of various scientific principals encountered during these derivations. Cheeke's book does, however, provide excellent insight into applications of ultrasonics and a tremendous number of useful references of original scientific work. The book provides the reader with a survey of the breadth of topics related to ultrasonics in one source together with the pertinent equations and their applications. I found this aspect of the book useful when providing a backdrop for fundamental topics being taught in the course."
4,A Great Guide for Costumers!,"Great book to have if you are setting up a theatrical costume shop. It covers all the bases, telling you what products you will need to run your shop smoothly. A basic knowledge of sewing is needed to utilize the patterns or draping suggestions in this book. This guide can't be beat when explaining modifying fabric (dyeing, distressing,etc.), as well as padding and undergarments, hats and masks. A must have for any costumer!"
4,Excellent Album,I only gave this Album a 4-star rating because Modern Day Folklore is better...Great Guitar Rock/Blues from Austin...Stevie Ray would be proud :)
4,The InterWorkings of a movie mastermind,"This book brought the movie into a new perspective. It made it very easy to explain certain scenes to our kids, so that they could truly understand the complexity of the movie and thus of the disaster. The actors/actresses speaking of the fear they felt on the set just trying to recreate the worst maritime disaster in history-gives us a small glimpse of what the passengers/crew faced that nite. Also, it gave us a new respect for all the hard work, long hours, difficulties that had to be overcome to delivery the greatest movie of all time to the public. Also, we get to see that James Cameron is human, he gets frustrated and upset just like everyone else, that in and of itself was reassuring, because he is so often portrayed as larger than life."
2,Very technical,"I'll buy anything to do with the Titanic, especially books, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's very technical, and not only takes into what happens during planning/filming Titanic, but goes into detail about the three years before it even begun filming. There's a lot of stuff about James Cameron's ""Abyss"", and there's really more detail than needed.It's a long hard slog to get through this book, and I wouldn't recommend it for Titanic fans out there. I'd recommend it to people who are interested in Titanic AND who are interested in the film making business. You could learn a lot from James Cameron."
2,Not a historical work...,"I read this book and I must say I was very dissapointed. As a autobiography of James Cameron and his movie, the book does a good job.But as for Perisi's Titanic information, she has made numerous errors. She gets alot of key dates in Titanic's story completely wrong. She has a good grasp of her subject matter, James Cameron, and she takes you inside the world of making movies which I found facinating. But, as far as the historical aspect of the book namely Titanic herself, Ms. Perisi equally demonstrates her lack of knowledge and research into Titanic's history.She could have read the book that everyone else on Cameron's Titanic set read ""Titanic: An Illustrated History by Lynch & Marschall"" before writing her account. She at least would have had an accurate Titanic timeline and a better grasp of Titanic's history."
2,Kind of biased and not historically correct,"If you are looking for a book on the movie Titanic that includes quotes from the stars, this is not the book for you. The author rarely quoted Leo and Kate and even put in some criticizing facts, like Leo playing video games everyday and Kate calling in sick everyday. While these may be true, she seemed biased because she turned around to praise Cameron. At times it seemed more like Cameron's biography than a book on his movie.This author is also not an expert on Titanic. What little historical information that is included is wrong. For example, she says the Titanic hit the iceberg at 10:30 pm and sank in 2 hours and 40 minutes, at 2:20 am. It should be that the Titanic hit the iceberg at 11:40 pm and sank at 2:20 am. If she had done her research on the event as well as the movie and it's making, she would have known that.This book is okay. I would not recommend buying it because I have read better books on the making of this great movie."
2,Mediocrity is the essence of this book,"I read this book about six months ago, and at the time I was very interested in learning whatever I could about the experiences and vision that this fine director brought to his artistic achivement ""Titanic."" Now, a short tme later, I can't for the life of me remember what the book had to say--and that's unusual for me, to finish a book and then not retain any clear sense of what the book had to say or what it contributed to my knowledge/understanding of a subject. The book itself is very easy to understand--simple-minded, even, in its handling of the material--yet it leaves no lasting impact on me. Far more vivid for me, as far as getting a sense of how Cameron looks at things and what ""Titanic"" meant for him, was ""James Cameron's Titanic."" That's the book to read if you want to get a feel for Cameron's emotional and working relationship to the movie."
3,Not for me,"I was told by a friend how excellent this product was and how it helped her so much with a recent illness. But it did not have much affect upon me. When I was coming down with a cold, I took it daily and it didn't seem to make much difference. My cold lasted more than one week and it did not seem as severe this time. So Primal Defense may have helped in that respect. But for the price, I would not buy it again, as it didn't really work for me ."
2,Doesn't work that great,"If you're in hot weather, or on a hot day don't expect this to keep your wine at an acceptable temp. If you're lucky maybe 10 to 15 below room temp. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Artificial,"Contrary to ""Tall story"" this movie was something that you couldn't take it seriously for second. Good acting saved couple of scenes though."
4,Fragile and Surprised they Still Had them!,A carafe is a carafe. but why do they constantly change them. you can't even buy this type of coffee maker anymore.
5,CAKE MAKES YA WANT TO SHAKE YOUR BUM,"Cake's first CD is so much fun! Pop it in if you're in a bad mood and want to be cheered up. It is for sure what I like to call ""Happy Music."" It will have you up and dancing around like a fool before you know it! The lyrics are zany and the music is fresh and zesty. I owe my love of Cake to #10 on Motorcade of Generosity. I heard it on the bus in 6th grade, fell in love with it, and now I own all three CD's. Please give them a listen, it will be worth your time! :)"
5,IT REALLY GROWS ON YOU!,"At first, I really didn't like CAKE, but my boyfriend lived on their music, so I often got stuck listening to them. But as time went by, they grew on me. Now I am taking the time and money to purchase their CD's. They really have made listening to music fun again. It's rare that you find a group with this talent. I have been very fortunate to be able to listen and enjoy their music, and I recommend it to all! I guarantee that even the most reserved listener will get enjoyment out of it!"
3,The Devil's Music,"Your pentagram is on the floor, huh? The ashes of dead babies? Satan is your motor? I really like all 3 albums, but it just dawned on me that I may be listening to devil-worshippers. Or maybe it's just more of their tongue in cheek humor."
5,I'm a huge fan and this album is as awesome as their others,"Today I have had the pleasure of finally listening to CAKE's first album. I own both of their others, and all three give me chills when the guitar or trumpet kick in. John McCrea's vocals are awesome, and I know his voice better than my own! I love you, CAKE! And to everyone else, buy all their albums!"
5,Trust No One (but me),"Please listen not to those who are not true believers...The songs on this and all of Cake's CDs are wonderful. I cannot think of any that I won't listen to. On this album, there are many funny songs that are great sing-alongs and some are just cool like that.Two songs that were dismissed by other reviewers happen to be faves of mine, ""Pentagram"" and ""Commanche."" These songs have seen the light of day several times in my car, at work, and at home. My absolute favorite is ""You Part the Waters."" One of the most intriguing parts of listening to McCrea's music is trying to figure out what kind of ""instrument"" he is currently discovered to use in his songs.Try this band if you have not already, maybe even start with one of their more recent, then bactrack, so you can get the true feel for the band and their wide range of musical talents..."
3,An ok album with some hidden gems...,"This is Cake's first album and it gets better as is goes along. It's pretty standard Cake fair but a little more uneven and polished than some the next two albums. Rock and Roll Lifestyle is one of those spoken-word songs that show how smooth the lead singers voice can be. Mr. Mastodon Farm, I Bombed Korea, Aint No Good end the album on a strong note after a lack luster first half.One annoying problem with this CD is that it was produced very cheaply and the songs are recorded at a lower volume than standard albums. This can be really annoying because it is quite a bit lower and of course I never remember to turn it back down afterwards until I've already blown my eardrums out.Bottom Line: Some good Cake songs but not thier best work."
2,For the Die-Hard CAKE fan,"My wife really got me into CAKE. I bought her every album and became a really big fan myself. This album, however, is them at their worst. It seems disjointed and rushed and like they threw this album together over the weekend. Their new album that just came out, Showroom of Compassion, is awesome and it feels like they're going back to what made them so much fun to listen to in the first place. Motorcade of Generosity is the only album of theirs that I wouldn't miss if my mp3 player mysteriously dropped it from my library."
3,Effectively modest,"3 1/2Cake's lo-fi debut may lack a certain refined pop prowess they became known for, but MOC works well enough on its own fuzzed out terms, with punctual musicality on top of a laid back white mariachi slackerdom."
5,*Great* vocals!! Really upbeat and energetic!,"This is Cake's greatest album yet! I love the lead singer--and he really gets to show off his talent. Cake knows a great array of instruments, and they use them!"
3,Cake is Sweet: Too Much Can Kill You,"I prefer the playful and stripped-down sound of MOTORCADE OF GENEROSITY to the We-Are-A-Serious-Rock-Band sound of FASHION NUGGET.On ""M of G"" John McCrea and Cake sound funny and fun; McCrea observes a lot but doesn't make too many judgement calls; the band chugs on ""Haze of Love,"" ""Jolene"" and my favorite, ""Rock 'N' Roll Lifestyle"" (OK, there's quite a bit of judgement laid out on that one).There's a few clunkers--""I Bombed Korea,"" ""Pentagram"" and ""Mr. Mastadon Farm"" are sophomoric poetry, at best--but they are the exception, not the rule. McCrea can cook on the uptempo stuff, but that vocal delivery on a slow song is comic.The disc ends with a great one: ""Ain't No Good,"" complete with Tex-Mex horns and a sloppy guitar solo, is some kind of bizarre hybrid, mixing the Velvet Underground and Los Lobos."
4,"Most of this album is Good, part is great, and part is ""eh""","I love Cake. This album is a good starting album for them. Their other albums, however, have better songwriting and a more polished sound. Songs like ""Comanche"" need to be buried and never see the light of day. ""Up So Close"" is good enough, as is most of the album, but suffers from some bad production. ""Jolene,"" however, is nothing short of brilliant. That song alone is worth the price of the album. Apart from the ""Comanche,"" and perhaps ""Haze of Love,"" the album is solid. It shows great potential, but it's not quite as good as the rest of their catalogue.In conclusion, however, the album is fun. It's easy to listen to, and there are a few great songs."
4,Cake's best,"Not much more to say after what others have added here... great musicianship, smart songwriting, clever lyrics and a solid outing all the way through. No unnecessary rehashing of original songs, no overwrought attempts to make their songs sound different than anyone else's. Just quality music."
1,One of the worst books I've managed to finish reading,"The unusual writing style quickly changes from charming to annoying. The philosophical ramblings are repetitious, too long, and just plain boring. The technical details are mostly stunningly stupid. I really like end of the world books, and I love naval fiction, but not this one."
2,"Slow moving book, end timers can find something better",This book took a long time to devolp charachters and situations. I would have preferred a book done on a larger scale. A large portion of the book was dedicated to moral and ethical issues as opposed to more believable attempts at communication and rebuilding and survival.
2,boooooring book,"I wanted to like this book, I really did, but found ""The Last Ship"" to be terribly 'overwritten'. The (barely) plausible plot is constantly buried under the authors ceaseless need to explain every act and conversation with a mind-boggling preface. It's as if the narrator/captain puts on his Socrates hat and weighs the very essence and meaning of life for perhaps a full page before allowing himself to say: ""Right full rudder."" About two thirds of the way through the book, the author finds he hasn't described a sex scene yet, so lets loose with a stunningly bad attempt to name all the girl parts, then the 'thrusting, throbbing, etc.' begins like a parody of a Penthouse Forum letter. And the ending came so weird and confusing, I was surprised only that it didn't surprise me at all."
5,Best novel,"This is by far the most touching and best crafted novel that I have ever read. Although the premise is somewhate dated (nuclear armageddon), the rising power of the ChiComs may bring it back into full relevancy. I am most regretful that William Brinkley never got around to writing a sequel to The Last Ship as he seems to hint about in the closing of this novel"
2,A very unsatisfying read,"My complaints about this book mirror what all the other negative reviews have hit upon. I could live with all those flaws if there weren't some other fatal flaws that I can't get past: 1) Why are all land masses covered with a black fog? This is unheard of as far as I know. 2) What about the French radio operator and the supposed explanation for how the war started? 3) You have a scenario that has the surviving crew living happily and peacefully on this island, yet some crew members go out all willy-nilly and create nuclear Armageddon all over again without any explanation save a couple of sentences of speculation? You gotta be kidding me. If someone has an explanation for all this, I'd love to hear it. 4) The love of his life has blown herself up in that little stunt, yet he doesn't spend a minute reflecting on the loss. What the heck?"
2,Lost Opportunity,"This book has a cool premise, but the author wastes the idea with his needlessly dense prose. Don't get me wrong -- I read a fair amount of dense books, but this one wasn't worth it.And did anyone else pick up vibes (subtle or not so subtle) of political and moral ideology that just helped to make the storyline sink? I felt beaten over the head innumerable times for why women should be in the Navy in combat positions, why nukes are evil, etc. Simultaneously, my interest waned considerably. Very soon into the book, the joy of reading was replaced with the tortuous process of trying to finish it in order to find out what happens in the end, but with little enthusiasm and fun in the process."
1,"Miss This ""Last Ship""","I was so glad I got this book out of the library; I hate to waste money. After the first 4 chapters of long-winded prose and very little substance, I was able to chuck it aside without a qualm. You want good post-apocalyptic fiction? Go re-read A Canticle for Liebowitz or Lucifer's Hammer. Don't bother with this."
1,"A terrible book -- poorly written, 'random' plot","An awful, awful book. Brinkley is evidently under the impression that the longer his sentences and the more adjectives he packs into them, the better the writing is. He's wrong. The style is convoluted, murky, and a chore to get through. (A reading of _The Elements of Style_ is in order for Brinkley.)The plot, which is admittedly a good one, suffers not only from poor writing, but from a series of seemingly random events (I won't give spoilers) thrown in simply to add twists and make the characters suffer. There's also a fair amount of silliness -- a nuclear winter that lasts a few weeks? Please.Don't bother. There are far, far better end-of-the-world books out there."
1,Will it ever end?!,"I have owned the hard cover version of this book for over ten years. I think I got it from a book club. About every year or so--in between Clancy, DeMille, and W.E.B. Griffin--I pick it up again and try to read it. I still have not made it all the way through. Simply put, the writing style is just plain painful! This is the last time. Going to give it way after this!"
3,A lite reading,"A mildly interesting novel of a surviving Naval ship and crew who is in the right place at the right time when the nuclear weapons are set off in a world wide war; and how they survived, along with a surviving Russian sub crew near by."
2,Nearly unreadable,I had such great hopes for this book and it was just an incredible disappointment. This author simply has no business writing novels. Some people simply have no aptitude for certain professions and----knowing this----they overcompensate by trying too hard and it definitely shows in this book.
1,S L O W,"I kept looking at the first publish date, this novel went along at such a slow pace and with such long, drawnout explainations for much of book, it felt like something from a completely begone age. This took all the fun from the book. What should have been an exciting novel of a brash new world, turns into a slow-paced, pulling your feet out of deep mud at every step kind of torment."
5,I loved it: A realistic scenario,I read every ''end of the world'' type of book I can get my hands on and this one was a real treat because I didnt expect to enjoy it so much. I'm a woman who doesnt ordinarily have an interest in the military side of these stories but this one hooked me and held me to the point I couldnt put it down (even though I'd checked it out from the library and it was a heavy hardcover which isnt my preference). I was especially impressed with its realism ... alot of these types of books are pretty far fetched but this sounded true to me and I loved the ending - shocking. I've also read those indicated by other reviewers here and found this one to be one of the best so I dont understand the negative opinions.
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"This book is a 616 page 1.4 pound sleeping pill. I kept nodding off throughout the duration of reading due to the maddeningly detailed and metaphorical ways the captain of the USS Nathan James used to describe everything including people around him without ever getting to some sort of point or conclusion of what he's talking about. As for the nuclear exchange you don't find out who started it or why, not that it really matters I suppose but it would have provided the book with an interesting aspect which would have made reading not so sleep inducing.So there you have it, the book The Last Ship and if you're a suffer of chronic insomnia then this book is just the thing to cure you, plus with every single word that was ever found in a Dictionary and Thesaurus used in this book it'll help boost you're vocabulary, so it is actually quite beneficial."
1,Not worth the paper it's written on...,"I have read no other book by this author and for that I'm glad. Only one time in my entire life of 50 years and about 8,500 books have I ever given up on a book and this is it. As a sailor I could not believe that some think his descriptions are accurate. The one most egregiously stupid part is when the Captain is wondering how he is going to convince the men and women under his command that they may be the seeds of new human race. He is wondering how he can convince them to have sex (procreate). LOLLLLLLLL. If the price for this book hits 5o cents, save your money."
2,The Last Reading of this author,"I have been doing talking books, I was very impressed at my willingness to drag myself through this book. Writing is very convoluted and pompous. I think a 50% volume reduction would have been about right. As far as plot, it was fairly believable from a psychological point of view, but the characters were thin and not bright (eg. how many women do you let disappear before you investigate ?) I found the ending abrupt and unpleasant. I don't require happy endings, but this was just stupid. I can't believe that anyone would want a sequel. Well, only me to blame for finishing it."
1,Save your money,"Well the only way to know what the book is about is to read the back cover. I have gotten 169 pages into the book and the story has made no mention as to why the ship has so little fuel and why they are on an island trying to catch fish and plant a garden.The book is mostly the captin talking to himself and very little of talking with the crew... BORING.. The worst book I ever bought.I am giving it to the local public library, if they will take it.."
2,Wha hoppa?,"Read this during one of my EOTW phases (also read Earth Abides, Alas Babylon, A Canticle for Leibowitz, Lucifer's Hammer, etc.). I have to say that it was a something of a chore to get through. Probably worth a read if you're into End of the World...HOWEVER, I still don't really understand the ending of this book (thus my review title). If somebody wants to give their opinion on WHAT they think happened and WHY, I would appreciate it. Email me at [...] (Simpson's reference)."
1,A sad waste of a major talent,By far the worst book ever published by Brinkley - a waste of paper and braincells. I was so disappointed after reading this that I am lead to wonder if there was not a ghost writer involved. There was none of the vivid characterization that fills his other works - It was loaded with the latest eco freak and pacificist buzz words.truly a tragedy that a great talent could sink so low.
2,"These are sailors, not Shakespeareans....","What I did like about Brinkley's ""The Last Ship"", is his worship and veneration of women. The 'climactic' love scene in the book is one of the most poetic and sensual I have ever read--a beautiful picture of the joys of a woman...but....sailors on American missile destroyers do not speak with the forced Shakespearean elocution that Brinkley portrays in the book. This unrealistic narrative, and his frequent philosophical musings made me wonder where his editor was. The story and imagery were good, if you did not miss it while skipping over the profundities and absurd dialogs."
4,"Interesting, pretty dry at times....","This was a good read, albeit somewhat dry and slow reading. In my opinion, the author gets a bit boring at times, too wordy! The book almosts reads like one of Melville's works.Again, a pretty good read, but somewhat long-winded at times. Kind of a weird ending, but I'll give the reader a chance to see for him/herself."
2,Writing style reminds me of Melville...,"Totally convoluted. I found myself skipping quickly through paragraphs of prose. Unlike some, I found the dialog and interaction between the characters the high point.As far as the plot goes, very interesting. A new take on a theme I darkly enjoy. However, many of the plot elements were not very plausible. Warning: Spoilers follow...You can't refuel a reactor at sea. Even if the Nathan Hale was built to be easily refuled, you just can't do it yourself. The outcoming rods would be very hot, for one. Two, the Russian rods would not be of compatible size or type.I don't think radiation would spread to all land masses as completely and quickly as the author supposes - especially in a limited exchange.The safest place for the missles is inside the ship and sub. If they were worried, they could have thrown the keys overboard. Salt water would eventually corrode the warheads and pollute the sea."
2,Meandering and Overwritten,"I wish I could give this book a better recommendation. It seemed like it would be a classic end-of-the-world epic like On The Beach. The problem is it's about 250 pages too long. There just isn't that much happening. They go here. They go there. At times, The Last Ship is a great character study. Some of the scenes are powerful and frightening. In other places there is page after page after page after page of dense, overwritten narrative. Eventually I began to scan through these blocks of droning text just to see what happened in the end.Brinkley also has a strange grasp of syntax. His writing can be confusing as heck. Often his sentences, like clouds, when I was boy, back East, where my parents owned our first home, which was a two story Victorian, are bent inside out with bewildering asides or backasswards placement of his nouns. A dozen times, I had to stop and trace my way through again just to understand what he was talking about.Two and a half stars."
3,Interesting but 200 pages too long,"This book is ok. Like many others have mentioned, the author writes in long sentences, often saying the same things many times using different words. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs often. The book is somewhat engaging, although I find it hard to understand how only to ships in the whole planet could have survived and no others, especially subs. Anyway, there are other better books like this one."
3,Worth reading,"It was hard to get into the book, in fact it was boring in the beginning. If you can get to middle of it then it is worth it. From the middle to the end it became quite exciting and you tend to forgive the yawning from the first half."
3,Pretty good end-of-the-world yarn.,"The book kept me turning the pages. That's about all you can ask; this is entertainment, not great literature. As others have noted before me, one does have to suspend disbelief. After all, it seems not too likely that the ship would happen upon a rather large island, with fresh water, that has never before been charted (has any piece of land bigger than a molehill NOT been charted in this day of satellite photography?)."
2,Stick with Neville Shute,"Brinkley labors to fully charecterize even the most peripherial figures in this novel. I was reminded of a creative writing class in which the assignment is to write 1000 words of description without any action. This excessive, often tedious ""adjectivitis"" has expanded what should have been a short story to over 500 pages. Additionally, the pictures of the crew that Brinkley paints are one dimensional and unbelievable: all the people on the ship seem to have been among the world's elite in every pre-navy activity, whether it was as a gymnast, jesuit, or ballerina. The random, unexplained plot ""twist"" at the end may have been Brinkley's attempt to capture a kind of hopeless angst; the meaninglessness of the denoument left this reader annoyed, particularly after having slogged through the aforementioned hyper description. I recommened that readers who seek a novel that reflects cold-war cultural anxiety choose Neville Shute's ""On the Beach"" instead."
1,500 Pages of Nothing,"I first picked up this book shortly after it was published in 1989. I finished it 15 years later because I found it languishing in a box in the basement. The Amazon review talks about how wonderful it is that the author spread out a slender thread over 500 pages. But this is exactly what is wrong with the book. It would have probably made a pretty decent 250 page book. All the reader gets in the additional 250 pages is filler, the same slim plot-lines repeated over and over. The ship puts ashore a landing party, the landing party finds nothing, the doctor tells the captain that the landing party has absorbed their limit on radiation. The author also tries to build up ""suspense"" in how the women will deal with the men, but I could see the ""resolution"" to this 200 pages before the ending. A truly awful book, deserving of NO stars."
1,Awful,"This author wrote in long, convoluted sentences that run on and on. He seemed to be trying to impress the reader with his vocabulary. It seemed like he wrote the book using a scrabble dictionary and a thesaurus at his side, using 300 hundred words when only 50 would do. He was so busy writing that he did not bother to tell the story.The basic premise of the story is good. Sex scenes read like medical journals, the characters are one dimensional, the plot is absurd, and the book is painful to read.Having spent 6 years in the Navy, I can tell you that many of the technical details in this book are wrong.I do not recommend this book. I gave it one star because the scale will not let you rate it any lower than that."
1,hard to get into,"I have just started this book. It is difficult to get into so there is no compulsion to stay with it. I hope in a few more pages it will become more interesting. Oh, it is about 1100 pages. So it had better get more interesting."
5,This One Stays With You.,"I first read The Last Ship some 10 or 12 years ago. I got hooked. I know all about the writting style complaints, but hey, my other favorite book is Moby Dick...call me a sucker for over-wrought sea stories!This is less about the ""end of the world as we know it,"" and all about escapeism and fantasy projection. Who among us, as a perfect fantasy, does not dream about removing civilization's constraints, wondering what we'd do in a world without rules and restrictions? So we sign on to the Nathan James and find out by looking through Brinkley's eyes.I think it is a pretty good view. The ending does suck...very unsatisfactory. Unless, that is, there were to be a sequel in the work. Since the book was written so many years ago, I fear Brinkley has dropped the implied promise of the book's last page.Too bad. I'd like to know what happened to the crew members who left for ""home.""I recommend this book."
4,"Incredible story, but the writing... give me a break!!!","The story of these people and the personal struggles that the must endure was enough to keep my attention throughout this often tedious book. I wish someone would take this idea and rewrite it into a form that does not exhaust the reader after a few pages. The author really over does the development of each twist in plot. The book, the story, has stayed with me for several years though."
1,The worst book I've ever read...,"This book doesn't even deserve 1 star. I read The Last Ship almost 15 years ago. It was an absolutely miserable experience. The language is convoluted and almost painful to read. It is almost incomprehensible. I am an avid reader and have read a fair amount of literature as well as fiction of all genres. As I recall, the narrator mentions that he is using ""elaborate language"" in order to preserve it for the diminished human race. The human race would be better off illiterate. Although the plot is good, the writing is just el-stinko bad. If you want to read this book, get it from the library for free. Don't pay a red cent for this novel. Blech."
5,A captivating story written in an exquisite manner.,"I bought this book for 25 cents in a public library garage sale because it was well worn and had an interesting cover. Months later, its message still haunts me. Brinkley wrote such descriptive text that I was pulled-into the story repeatedly, living the experience with the captain and crew and dreading the rapid pace with which I was consuming the book. Being an engineer and vocabulary-challenged, I had the dictionary handy, but the eloquent language did not intrude in the storytelling. This book is easily among my favorites over the years."
4,Left me wanting more!,"At first it was difficult to get involved. However, once I arrived, I felt myself drawn to the plight and survival of the crew. As I drew closer to the end, I felt that there was a great deal left to be told and Mr. Brinkley left me wanting more. I have actualy been searching for Brinkley's sequal but unfortunately, it seems, he hasn't written it yet. Mr. Brinkley, please finish the voyage!! The LAST SHIP is an excellent novel."
4,The world is destroyed and man must rebuild.,"Told in a narrative style by the Captain of a Navy destroyer that has released nuclear missles against Russia and comes to find out that the world has been rendered pretty much uninhabitable because Russia did the smae thing to us.This is a story of morality and decision making in the face of horrible odds. Perhaps not as much ""action"" as I would have liked, but the description of what could happen to earth after a nuclear war really got me thinking. I'm suprised this has never been made into a film.Looking for a sequel."
1,One of the worst books I have read.,"I have read many ""end of the world"" books. This book had a good premise, but it was one of the worst written books I have ever read. This book was a struggle to read. There are many better ""end of the world"" books out there."
1,Worthless - dimmer than 13 watt bulbs,"I have purchased both the 13 watt bulbs (equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent) and the 23 watt bulbs - supposedly the equivalent of a 100 watt incandescent. The illumination provided by the 23 watt bulb is only slightly brighter than a candle, nowhere near the illumination of the 13 watt bulb. I am returning the 23 watt bulbs to get my money back - what a farce. This product is garbage."
2,Disappointing print quality,"This is a classic, first printed in 1910. It is written informally but knowingly by a former clipper captain who had known Donald McKay personally. So far so good. The book, however, is not a standard edition. It has been produced by some sort of facsimile technology, and it's a mess. There are markings, marginalia, etc. by some unknown but no doubt (now) elderly hand. The book, one can tell from somewhere in there, was at one time part of the University of Michigan Library. The several illustrations are for the most part defective due to the process of reproduction. Page 96, to cite one instance, is hardly readable because the right margin is missing four or five letters, leaving the reader the exciting game of word guessing. This is not acceptable, either to the reading public or to the memory of the man of action turned author and historian. Shame."
5,awsome,"max mclean is awsome, best bible narrator out there, hes a gift from God thats forsure! if you like to listen to the bible instead of read it, check out his listeners bible."
1,Mark's Gospel as Told by Max McLean - DVD - All Regions,"Really could not get into this DVD. I thought it was going to be a movie, but it is more of a commentary."
2,not what i wanted,"this book showed much of basic TCM theory with little technics, and technics was not much different than swedish and deeptissue technics. tui na technic vary, some said 12 different techs, some said up to 35 different techs. it would'nt matter how many techs it use as long as it shows how to use different techs and why it use it. how to transit one techs to another techs. this book lacks latter part."
3,Not too much,"When I have this book in my hands first time I liked how many photos and how easy to follow it may appear. Well now I am studing 1500 pages 5volumes book just on theory of the Classical Chinese Medicine (unfortunatelly not available in english.. just Czech language) compiled from moct basic old chinese canons.. So my view is.. trying to explain yin yang, 5 elements (which in fact are not any elements) on several pages and then explain meridians and points in rest of the book is.. well just making nice product for sale. Well you may say that business is about it.. so yes but than.."
2,overpriced book,Content of this book is useful to learn the advanced techniques of puppet making. But nearly $50 for a 70 page xrox-copy quality binding material is an outrageous overpricing.
1,Inappropriate for younger audiences,"I was pretty disappointed with this book for several reasons.Probably the main one was the inappropriate images used for examples. I was purchasing this book to work with my children on developing some stop motion puppets, but I will likely have to cut out a whole chapter or more before I will let them read the material.Also, the photographs in the book are generally low quality with varying degrees of pixelation.Pay attention to the page length, this is a rather short book."
4,Educational,Gave it to my niece who showed interest in rocks and gems...she is working through it and enjoying the information
4,"Stormy, lyrical and luminous","This is European jazz of the highest order. In the absence of a strong Afro-American input it doesn't swing or swagger but the rhythm section is beautifully supple and springy throughout and the lyricism of Jarrett and Garbarek warms the soul.The title track is a stormer, whipping along at a furious pace and sometimes teetering on the brink of madness, yet never losing the plot. It then segues into reflectiveness, setting the tone for the beautiful Prism that follows.Having Jarrett and Garbarek share the spotlight is great for both of them. They play off each other's lyricism and explore purposefully, but without the meandering they're apt to indulge in as solo front men.I actually feel more five stars than four stars about this album but that's because I usually skip the throwaway ""Late Night Willie"", a bit of would-be bluesy fluff that doesn't fit the tone of the rest."
3,Not really worth the price,"There are a few great songs here for fans of the show, but think twice before you pay $14 for what is essentially a half hour of TV soundbytes. Most of the tracks are a minute or less in length. If you want specific tracks for a mix CD or playlist, then buy them from iTunes. If you just want Spongebob-themed noise to entertain your kids, then let them watch the show instead."
1,Unfortunate purchase,"Our family are huge Spongebob fans. That being said, this CD contained little to no effort to produce or to create. There are other Spongebob Cd's to buy, this is not one of them."
3,"Plenty of Sound, No Video","Yeah, Spongebob is great. The little songs are great. But if you expected video clips, then you'll be disappointed. They simply are not there. I'm not bothered, but your little kiddies might be."
2,No video bonus as promised!,"Very disappointed to put the CD in the computer and only see the audio files. No music videos on are in like the booklet advertises. It says ""Includes Bonus Music Video ""Squidward's Clarinet"" from the Complete First Season DVD and ""Cha Ching"" from the Lost in Time DVD coming out February 2006."" Tried using this as positive reinforcement for my son (as a reward), and now we are both disappointed. I can't even find the music videos online anywhere."
1,Item STILL not received.,"I ordered this item, along with other orders, on 20th November. I received an email to confirm the expected arrival date of 14th Dec. Today is the 28th Dec. I still have not received it. Needless to say, I am very dissapointed in Amazon and will think twice about using it again. Amazon, please contact me at skamanalex@hotmail.co.uk to inform me when I will recieve my order, or get my money back. Thankyou."
3,Enjoyable read with a few shortcomings.,"This was my first Sari Robbins read and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice storyline and the characters were well-developed and likable. I liked that Edwina wasn't physically perfect, but capable of being desired all the same.The love scenes were few and far between and a bit tame in my opinion. It was a sweet story that made for an interesting read.Prescott was not my type of hero. He is haunted by his past, but he is generally an amiable, likable guy. I guess I just prefer the dark, brooding, tortured hero. Just a preference. ;)3 1/2 stars."
1,How the hell did this author get published?,"I really really wanted to love this book. I loved the title and cover. However, this has to be one of the stupidest plots ever created. The characters are shallow, not well developed, and the plot is not realistic. I couldn't even get past Chapter 2."
2,Kind of dumb,"I thought the whole premise of this book was ridiculous. The hero is an orphan who somehow became a society gigolo. Talk about rising above your station. The heroine manages to somehow talk him into a fake engagement, in order to relieve her of the pressures of fighting off suitors, thereby freeing up enough time so that she can hunt down a blackmailer.I'd call that regency suspense taken to an extreme level of silliness."
5,For K5SS,"Got this to replace a 20 year old K5SS beater that was starting to chip. Read one review that said it wouldn't fit a K5SS but it fit perfectly. Package said Whirlpool instead of Kitchen Aid, but Kitchen Aid is owned by Whirlpool now so who knows. Only difference I can see is the thickness of the shaft looks slightly thinner, but it's hard to tell if my old one is just bubbling making it look thicker or if they thinned it down. Doesn't matter, it works fine."
2,Weak coating,The only reason I had to replace this was because the coating was peeling. Why is the coating necessary? Couldn't they have made it of stainless steel or burnished aluminum like the beaters for their other models?
3,Confused non cook,"I will start by saying, I'm not a cook.That said, this doesn't look anything like what I imagined a dough hook to look like. I thought it would look like Captain Hook's replacement hand.In general, I can't figure out how to order anything with certainty for my wife's Kitchen Aid. After reading other people's stories, it is clear I'm not alone.I just ordered a second bowl and the wrong beater. The bowl may be wrong also. No way to tell."
5,Kitchen Aid Flat Beater,"The plastic on my, approximately, 30 year old flat beater was peeling off. I ordered a new one from Amazon. As usual, it arrived promptly and was a perfect replacement for old one. Have used it several times and it's just like new again. (Oh, thats right, it is new.) If you have a Kitchen Aid K5A and need a new flat beater, I recommend this one."
5,Great product!,This was exactly what I needed and it just so happened that Amazon put KitchenAid items on sale at the time I needed it! Thanks!
1,Paint chips then you eat paint or throw this away,"I don't know why kitchenaid can't figure this--these painted blades chip easily. Once they start to chip, the chip even more easily. Alternativly they make a blade with unpainted but burnished metal. If ine peron forgets and puts it in the dishwasher even once, it's ruined. They should just chrome plate or make them out of stainless -- it would be costly but would work. what kitchenaid offers now does not work."
3,Beater review,"I've used this beater less than a dozen times and the white is already chipping off. I had read another reviewer had the same problem. But this is the only merchant who had this beater for my older Kitchenaid mixer. Sp I took a chance, but the chipping is happening to my beater also."
2,incorrect part does not fit a 5 quart ksm 150 mixer,the part I ordered was to WAY to big for my mixer. this is supposed to be the replacement part for what I needed. I have a KSM150PSOB so on to keep looking.
3,"This has not been used, as yet.","I bought one for my daughter as a gift. She is not at home, so she cannot report if she likes it or not."
3,Decent Product,Handwash this paddle! I think putting in the dishwasher weakens the enamel and chips off at the bottom.
1,Doesn't fit KitchenAid K5SS,"I don't know if this will help anyone else, but be very careful if you are purchasing this as a replacement for the K5SS. My mixer is about 14 years old, and I needed a new beater. After researching what fits, this was the item according to the Kitchen Aid website. It looks exactly the same on the outside, but something is not right on the inside. It will not lock into place when you put it on. This came in an original looking Kitchen Aid box, and all looked great on the outside, it just didn't work. I will be calling KitchenAid to get advice and will update if I learn anything of use. Service in receiving and refunding was prompt by Amazon."
5,Coated Flat Beater,"I am not really sure how people are using there beaters. First this beater is Nylon coated NOT enamel.I need to order a new one because I misused mine, the bowl was not seated correctly in my stand and it jammed the beater (the mixer was on high at time) causing some of the coating to come off. I have had my stand mixer for over 10 years and never has the coating on the beater just flaked off, I put it in the dishwasher never any problems. My parents Kitchen Aid is over 35 years old, they are still using there original Nylon coated beater, again no problems.In case your not sure which beater to buy: The one that looks like captain Hooks hand, is a dough beater, for breads and pastas the flat beater is for batters like cakes and cookies softer doughs. The whip is used for making whipped cream or meringue (whipped egg whites) or when a recipes says to whisk something.I hope this was helpful to you."
1,Chips Too Easily,"I am ordering my fourth flat beater replacement because the plastic chips off the beater too easily. I handwash and store it wrapped in a cloth in the bowl, yet the plastic finish chips off. While the other beater requires a bit more care, it will be cheaper in the long run."
1,dont buy,I have used is only 4 times and the coating is starting to crack and now I am unable to use it and have replace
5,Glock 30 Works great,I use this holster for my Glock 30. It works perfectly. The tension is good out of the box. A switch pull pops the pistol right out of the holster. When placing the pistol in the holster it will click firmly in place. I find the angle that it places the pistol in to be very well placed -No need for a roto holster. Its great for concealed carry under a longer jacket. Don't bother trying to use this under a T-shirt if your attempting to conceal.
5,sigma sw9ve,Good fit and function. Would purchase again. After a lot of draws doesn't make up pistol. Nice product for a low price holster...
5,Fits like a glove,"I bought this for my S&W Sigma Series 9mm and it really fits like glove. The pistol draws smoothly and the paddle keeps the holster secure. The price was the best out there, just about every where else was $30."
2,"Very comfortable, hate the shrinking and warping","I've had my pair for only three weeks. I went out in the wet grass in my yard this morning and then left the wet shoes on my covered porch. Went out 45 minutes later, and the left shoe was warped and the right shoe had shrunk. It was only 90 degrees outside, so this is unacceptable. Will not buy another pair."
1,fatal flaw,"These shoes were great for the first 3 weeks until one day when I left them in the car. One of the crocks sat in the sun and shrank half a size. I called the company, they know about the shrinkage issue, but unless you bought them through their web site, they'll do nothing to help you. I've worked around the outdoor retail business for years, and have never run into a more frustrating return policy."
3,Who Knew That They Shrink?!?,"Agreed, they ARE comfortable and perfect for slipping on to run outside, doing errands around the house, and running errands in general. However, these shoes shrink! I thought leaving them on the back step for quick access was a good idea, but I guess it wasn't. Shame too because they are Disney Crocs with great little Mickey-head cut-outs in them. Thank goodness they're inexpensive so they can be replaced."
3,The Amazing Shrinking Croc,"I loved my croc flip flops. I bought them in later spring and until yesterday, I pretty much wore them everyday. They were so light weight and I have a foot injury, so they didn't hurt my foot like my other sandles. I had to attend a funeral yesterday afternoon, so I threw my tennis shoes and crocs in my gym bag for after the funeral. When I got done working out, I went to slide my crocs on and couldn't fit my foot into them. THey are warped and at least two sizes smaller. I will probably buy another pair, but think they should have at least warned me."
2,Crocs DO shrink.,"The fact is that crocs are VERY comfortable. So much so that I actually convinced several people to purchase a their own crocs after I related how comfy mine were.However, after a few hours left in the sun, mine have shrunk so much that I now cannot wear them.There are people writing on here that theirs have not shrunk in similar circumstances. Well, that's great for them, but it does not change the fact that a significant portion of crocs owners, as represented by reviewers on this site, have in fact had their crocs shrink. And that's a real problem.At the very least, prospective buyers need to be aware of this situation. Since the crocs company is not inclined to share this info, it really is up to us, the consumers, to do so."
2,Crocs will shrink in heat!,Left in car during 100F day. Car was hot and they shrunk like George Constanza's package in the cold pool. They shrunk 1-2 sizes and are garbage to me now. Loved them before that. I will attempt to return for poor advertising of this fact at REI.
3,fix your Corcs,"Like every one else, I have a pair of the 'incredible shrinking' Crocs. I took the advice of Scott, who also wrote a review, and I put my Croc's in boiling water for 1-2 mins. and slipped them on (over socks) after knocking the hot water off in. Kept them on until they cooled down and now they fit better then I first bought them! It worked!! No kidding!! They fit great once again, thanks for the advice. I have read that 10 minutes in the Dryer will help they 'soften' also. Glad to have my Crocs back."
2,shrunken croc sandals!,I am very very dissapointed in my croc sandals i purchased and loved! They are now about 2 sizes too small and good for nothing! I could not have even imagined that these shoes would shrink. I just thought i accidentally picked up someone elses sandals instead of mine until I started to look up and read all the reviews and complaints! These shoes are way too expensive to have such poor quality... I'm just another dissatissfied customer!!! Think twice before purchasing these disposables!
2,Disappointed,"I've had my crocs a while now and loved them up until this very day. My left shoe had shrunk to a third of the original size. Now, I checked the crocs website, did a website search and found NOTHING on the site talking about possible shrinking. Based on what I've read about the company not giving a crap about this and being very aware of this issue, I'm utterly amazed they continue to do such good business. Their practice is unethical and I now refuse to buy another pair, as does my family. It's sad that I've lost all faith in this company, but thankfully this happened before I purchased another pair."
2,Crocs TOTALLY shrink,"My hubby left his on the back deck after using them in the yard and they shrunk almost 2 sizes. So lame-we got them for gardening, but if you can't leave them by the back door after you are done b/c they'll shrink in the sun, then what is the point? We will get different clogs in the future."
3,Too drawn out,There was too much repetition of facts. Took too long to get to the interesting parts boring in others. Overall interesting.
3,Mediocre,"I'm a Singer fan but I felt this book was woefully inferior to his other books. So much so that I didn't bother to finish it. The book started off well enough but as the plot went on, it got more and more unbelieveable. The dialog was especially sophomoric and I began to feel that I was reading a book for teenagers. I also found the characters to be not very authentic and, in the case of one prisoner, downright silly. All in all, I wasn't enjoying the book. So, I decided to chuck it and hope that my next Singer book will be a good one."
5,A great read,"Randy Singer is a very accomplished lawyer and writer. Writing from a decidedly Christian perspective, he makes his characters alive and very believable. I loved this book."
4,Very enjoyable read,"This is the first book I have read of Mr. Singer's, and it was good enough that I intend to read more.It was such a nice change of pace to read a ""suspense"" novel without having to read all the cursing and sexual content of most books.Please know that, while the Christian message is there, it is definitely not so strong as to put off readers who don't consider themselves to be Christians."
5,Excellent tool,"You do indeed get what you paid for. It seems to be dead-on as my wood joints come out tight. The lip works great for marking boards, and its perfect for tuning tools. Incra offers a lifetime accuracy guarantee on their website, and even claims ordinary drops can't affect the angle. And I drop alot of tools."
4,light but nice,"I bought this comforter for my dad for Christmas, and he seems happy enough with it. It was pretty lightweight and thinner than I had expected, but it was very, very soft. He seems like he likes it anyway."
4,HOW CAN YOU EXPECT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY?,"FOUR TRACKS:1. How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously? (12"" Mix) 6:032. How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously? (7"" Perfect Attitude Mix) 4:103.

2,Less than I hoped,"I purchased this book with the hope that it would help me prepare for the 70-282 exam. Actually, it appeared to be more of a topic over view for someone who has a great deal of experience with SBS 2003. I found that the author rambled a lot and left major gaps in the necessary information. There were a lot of references to material that was never explained, other than to plug two other books that he had written which supposedly had the answers. I didn't buy them because I felt the organization here was so poor. In addition, he provides case studies as quiz material, and the content involves questions on materials not covered in the text.The other major problem is that this book is outdated. It doesn't cover SBS 2003 R2, nor does it handle Vista. As a result, some of the guidance is simply wrong now.I finally purchased another book which has been very helpful in learning SBS 2003. I will go back through this book later before taking the exam, and hopefully it will be helpful then."
1,Should have listened to the other reviewers,This book is so full or errors its annoying. The answers to some of the questions don't make sense and are wrong. This was a total waste of money.
2,"Not good, but there is not much else out there for small business server 2003","This book is not good. No flow, practice questions at the end of the chapters are generic and don't cover the material read in the chapters. The author bombards the reader with constant advertisements for his other books. Note to author, if your books are well written you don't have to promote your other books every chapter. The good points, if there are any, is that the book is an easy read and it's another book to prepare for the 70-282 exam. I passed the exam, but would attribute my success to Transcender practice exams and Microsoft Windows Small Business Server 2003 Administrator's Companion. Use this book as a supplement only."
2,Problems,"Ok, the desire is there but there is something lacking. Maybe it is me. I assumed (we all know what that means) that there would be a lot more here about supporting SBS. Granted I have not taken the test, but there just was not any meat to this book.It has been commented that the example questions were strange and while I can relate now (after reading the book) why they were written the way they were, it does not help.If it is not wizard based, the book misses it. How the wizards work they way they do, the book misses it. If the test only wants to know about wizards, then it is not like the other M$ tests I have taken.All this is said, I have not taken the test and it might fit it exactly.On the other hand, I found the book very useful for tasks involving SBS and it will sort of make a good reference book for my library."
1,Worst Study Guide I've Ever Used,"I really have to start paying attention to the user reviews before I buy a book! This book is, by far, the worst ""study guide"" I've ever encountered.The ""content"" is a joke. I found myself trying to scan over the fluff to get to something useful only to find myself at the end of yet another chapter. The material is full of errors and inconsistencies. The review questions are even worse, with wrong answers not uncommon (that's always a big help when you're preparing for a test). But the most annoying thing of all is the never ending references to other SMB Nation books, websites, whatever. ARRRGGG! It's like being constantly interrupted with commercials. Add to that ongoing psycho-babble like ""don't out think yourself"" (repeated at least 20 times), is enough to make you crazy.Enough, you get the idea."
1,Wouldn't recommend it,"The technical training value of this book is ""light"" to put it mildly. Coupled with many ""eaten"" words, misspelled words and down right grammar mistakes, make this book a MUST AVOID. I wasted $39.00, but if someone out there reads this and buys a different book, let that be my consolation.Most of the questions at the end of each chapter do not follow on the subject discussed previously. Some even have answers to non-existent questions (like the right answer on question 2 is E, but there were only 4 choices!?!).They advertise an extra chapter and extra test questions if you fill up a registration form and fax it to them...Nonsense! I did but did not receive what they promised and my e-mail inquiries remained unanswered.But the main reason I would recommend to buy somewhere else is because of the very low technical knowledge one would gain from putting up with all the above."
2,The gayest exam prep guide ever!,"Please! What technology consultant talks like this? And how about practice questions like the one that gives you a choice of servers that use PIII's and 8GB Drives? Here's the way to pass the exam: Join the partner program at the registered level, buy the MAP subscription, buy a Dell P4 with 2GB RAM & a small drive array, then install the SBS 2003 that you get in MAPS. Hands-on, Hands-on, Hands-on. This book is for people who don't know DSL from USB. A waste of time and money."
2,"Some Good Tips, But WAY TO MUCH SELLING","Overall, I found the book (2nd printing) to be an ok read in that it gave several good tips of what to expect on the exam.On the negative side, there were way to many attempts to sell the authors other SBS 2003 books. Frequently, a topic would be covered lightly and then a sales pitch for ""more information in our blah blah blah book"". If this book is supposed to be the 70-282 prep guide, why should the reader be forced to buy another book just to have the material covered?"
1,It's the only game in town,"If only I'd listened to the other reviews first, I might not have bothered with this. It's hard to use a study guide that can't even keep track of the answers - a multiple choice with four solutions should never, ever have a correct answer of 'E'. Even when they keep the lettering choices correct, there's no continenuity between the large, prominately posted answer and the explaination given below. DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR PRIMARY STUDY GUIDE FOR 70-282. If you're intent on passing the test, use your existing Windows 2003 and Exchange Server 2000 knowledge, and suppliment it with ""How To Cheat At ... Small Business Server 2003""."
2,If you expect to get technical stuff this is not the book,It was the only book available in order to prepare for the 70-282 exam when I bought it. But it was so shallow (if you can say that about a book) that it was no good. I can't remember one thing learned from this book. A complete waste of my time.
1,Will NOT prepare you for the test,"Please, do not buy this book if you are taking the 70-282 test. It is horribly out of date, and I would say about 85% of the test content is not even addressed in the book. I took the test in July 2006 and was surprised by just about every question.In addition to completely irrelevant content, this book also offers awful writing, layout and editing."
2,Outdated,"The exam changed may-june 2006, as a well focused book it is now out of focus. A more general book over SBS, like SBS 2003 Unleashed is more helpfull, although not enough concerning Exchange and some aspects of Windows 2003."
1,Mistakes galore,"This book comes with two pages of mistake corrections, and that's only the mistakes they found. I've found some that aren't on the list. This is a book that's suppose to be teaching me stuff I don't know but I don't really know if what I'm reading is correct or not. I'm not happy at all."
1,Right Title Wrong Cast,"This is a made for TV movie starring David Jansen! It's like you took the TV series ""Heat of the Night"" and made it into a werewolf movie! Hey, it was good for the price!No Claude Rains!!!!"
1,"DVD-R's that make you go ""Hmmmm""...","Wow, Universal made a similar movie in '41 called ""The Wolfman""; anyone remember that one?Sheeesh Artiflix- bootleg much?The Wolf Man (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection)"
2,Poor sound quality,"Unfortunately, I purchased two sets of these thinking they were going to be good speakers for my pcs. I don't require high end speakers, just basic ones. These have very poor sound quality and sound like they are coming from inside a tunnel. I wouldn't buy these again."
3,These are just OK.,"After receiving and setting these up, I regret not spending a bit more for speakers that have their own volume knob or have their own power source. I work in an office that is not loud, but not whisper quiet either, and so I had to turn the volume on the computer up to the maximum in order to hear what was coming out of the speakers. I'm attributing these soft sounding speakers to having no additional power source. Also, I'm realizing that a volume knob on the speakers would be a nice added convenience for quickly turning up or down the volume. Other than these small gripes, the speakers are fine for the price."
5,closer to the real flush,"I am a very fair caucasian (northern european, actually) and I bought this blush in Taos. This add a nice pop of colour to the cheeks, great for those who like a bit more colour. This mimic perfectly a post work out glow. Though since it is a warm tint it is better suited for summer."
5,"Long wearing, Natural Color",I bought this blush after reading about it in a magazine. The color I use is orgasm. It gives a natural glow to my fair skin and wears fabulously. I can go from day to night and usually don't need a touch up.
3,Nice blush but not spectacular,"Everything I read said that Nars Orgasm was the best blush ever, in the whole world and on and on... I ran out of blush so I got a Nars blush in the Orgasm color ... Ok, so its nice. The texture of the pressed powder is very fine, and it goes on smoothly with a big sable brush. The compact is nice looking but it has no applicator, so if you travel make sure you pack an applicator for this.I like the blush, but I don't think I just HAVE to have it again. I really like the Yves Saint Laurent Blush Variation 11, and the new YSL Touche Blush that has the applicator built into the bottle. I think I like the YSL products a lot more than Nars. Nars tends to skimp on applicators - and make it difficult for you to use their products if you travel. I have their eyeliner in a bottle with a separate applicator - a pain to travel with too. (YSL products also smell better than Nars products)"
3,Beware if you are acne-prone...,"I truly love this blush...the texture is so silky and the color is so beautiful and it lasts for hours...but it makes me break out! I am so dissapointed! As soon as I use it, a couple of hours later, I have a zit on my cheek! I have switched to Bare Escentuals blushes, which are also pretty, and I have not broken out. I so do wish Nars would create a oil-free version, then I can go back and start using it again..."
4,"Excellent string playing, mediocre recording","This CD contains two very beautiful Brahms string quartets played extremely well by a French group. While not underplaying the drama in these works, the Ludwig Quartet brings out Brahms as a composer of lieder. These performances sing with a delightful freshness not found in more aggressive performances. Their playing has many moments of radiant beauty. Although the recording has too much reverberation, the string playing is so good that I regularly listen to this CD and put up with the mediocre sound."
5,Very helpful,This cd is helping me teach Spanish in a very attractive way. I let my baby listen to it on when we are on the road. Keeps him quiet and is an instructional and fun device.
1,Messy,"The price is right, and this Cuisinart makes fine coffee (although the carafe seems to hold a slightly smaller amount of coffee than our previous coffee makers), but it is very messy. With each pot brewed, we end up with coffee grounds all over the inside of the coffee maker, including the water reservoir. I think a re-design is needed for this model.I was nervous ordering a reconditioned unit, but we have found no operating problems and will feel more confident ordering reconditioned items in the future."
4,Classic Mercedes,"If you have a car like this or want a car like this, or have a car book collection, you should probably get this book. It's the best one for these cars in English. A definite reference book."
5,Roy does it again!,Great to see this pressious work from Walt Disney again.Presented by Roy Disney proof to have great teast!Movies maid in the fifty's have not lost there charme and quality.a Great achievement to bring back this artwork and fully restaurated.I recommanded all four volumes!I hope that the Disney compagny make an second release on Blu Ray.For the mean time:Roy does it again!
3,Why stop there?,"The TRUE LIFE ADVENTURES had all dirt and scratches removed. Pristine and beautiful. Unfortunately material on disc 2 did not get this cleanup,kinescopes and other features had all dirt and scratches intact. Disappointing."
5,1080p POWERHOUSE!!,"The unit casts an unbelievable image. Not just beautiful, detailed, 3-D, and exciting, but deeply soul-satisfying. The rich color is accurate out of the box, and setup is an absolute breeze. HDTV is superb, HD DVD is impossibly fantastic, and even SD looks great. VGA input gives a simple computer connection. Blacks are good except in very dim scenes, when they become a drawback. That's a small concession for such an extraordinary value in a TV. The quality of the built-in video processing alone is worth the cost. There is simply no comparison with flat panels or rear projection. You should have a 100-plus in. diag. screen in a DARK room for maximum impact."
5,Life begins in the heart at home,"An extraordinarily fine stylist, Mr. Sanders reminds us in the very personal essays how important it is to value home and heart. Lives begins at home; life begins when we know where our home is."
1,A Good Book to Read in Winter,"because you'll want to toss it in the fireplace when you're finished. If you're not quite sure what an elitist academician is, read ""Staying Put"" and you'll never again have any doubt. Sanders clearly occupies the lower ranks of this group, but he fits the mold perfectly of a pompous professor who believes no thought that pops into his head, no matter how tiny, must go unexpressed. Of course, I may be wrong. This book may be a shrewd satire of such a blowhard personality, but I doubt it. In any case, it is a waste of time and money."
5,A great asset to my shop,"I have no way to test this tool except to use it to calibrate my tools and if the woodworking job comes out perfect then I know this tool was dead on for what I use it for. I have 4 Incra guaranteed squares(5"" square, 5"" 45 degree, 7"" square, and 7"" 45 degree) and absolutely use them religiously to calibrate all my tools (table saw, jointer, planer, miter saw, band saw, drill press, circular saw, router table, etc.). While they are expensive I learned in an engineering class that you have to pay more for better tolerances and the expense here is well worth it over a cheap square. Yet there are more expensive squares out there and the Incras are ""guaranteed"" so if they are not perfect they will make it perfect. If you purchase these I don't see how you will be disappointed as they are one of the best asset you can buy for quality work."
4,Incra 90-degree square: an impressive standard.,"This Incra 90-degree square is to say the least, a beautiful tool. Very solid in its construction, and impressive look at and hold, I have found this item very helpful as a standard to set up my machine tools, where a true 90 degrees is required. My only complaint is that there is no measuring scale on this tool. Well not designed to be a ruler, a scale would make this tool more useful in the day to day activities in the shop."
4,Study Bibles,This New King James Bible version is really nice. It's bound in leather and has lots of good helps in it. It is the King James Bible without the thees and thous. It also works good with my Crudens concordance. The price was good too.
1,Don't Buy,I purchased the Kindle version of the NKJV Study Bible for the Kindle app on my Motorola Zoom. It does not work. You cannot navigate from various books and chapters to other books and chapters without much manipulation. It is not user friendly at all. I have a perper copy of this bible and find it to be a very good source for bible study.
3,Kindle Edition needs improvement.,"This is an excellent Bible.I have a copy that I thoroughly enjoy reading, but the Kindle edition needs easier navigation to the verses. Some Bibles have an index feature that makes it easier, but there is no direct jump to Scriptures (as far as I can tell) on this one. I will purchase again when that issue is resolved. Everything else is great."
4,new king james study bible,"This bible has lot of references & maps. Its also has prophetics meaning subjects but with not enough details. On the two columns each page, it should have the verse layout as the kjv holy bible. Otherwise it is a good learning bible"
5,NKJV Study Bible,"This is an excellant resource for all Christians; ranging from those new to the faith to mature Christian workers. I highly commend it. Also, it makes a fine wedding gift for any couple."
5,Highly Recommended Choice for a Bible,"This is the best Bible I have ever bought!It really helps you to understand the time period that the scriptures were written in. The New King James Version is an Excellent Version.The Study notes really help you to understand the scriptures, they make the scriptures a real joy!I highly recommend this Bible especially to anyone that really wants to dive in and feast on God's Word!"
1,Kindle version has no study notes,"I have the printed copy of this study Bible and I love it. But, the Kindle ebook version is missing all of the verse study notes/commentary, which is the primary reason to buy a study Bible. The ""How to use this ebook"" description says that you just click on the hyperlinked verse number to get to them. There are fuctioning hyperlinks for the scripture cross-references, and they work like a charm. But there are simply no hyperlinked verses in the entire Bible, nor is there a study notes section listed in the Table of Contents. So, it's not just a hyperlink problem - the entire study notes section is missing. I downloaded the sample Bible and I noticed they were missing, but I felt certain that if I bought the full version, the study notes would surely be there, since this is after all a study Bible! But even after purchasing the full version, they are simply not there. Sadly, I had to return this for a refund. Hope they get this fixed in the future."
5,tremendous study tool (first edition),"The first edition is THE best general study Bible I have ever found as a pastor-teacher. The word studies are excellent and the study notes are an excellent resource. The first edition is doctrinally orientated toward Free Grace. However, in the second edition the notes were changed to reflect a doctrinal orientation toward Lordship salvation and I can no longer recommend it. Unfortunately, this change was done without any warning to the buyers of this product. I was shocked and dismayed when I bought a new one (my old one is wearing out) and made the discovery. I hope Amazon and other booksellers note the difference for buyers."
4,Very Good,"This item is good but not great, It does the job and I would only recommend it for fast shine - less effort than regular wax.Don't expect to obtain wonders out of this but It's quite a decent product."
5,Will get your car shiny!,"I have a black car. I will never get another black car again unless I come across some large sum of money and can shell out the time and money ($25 per week) to have a black car washed. So, I often wash my car myself and that's when I apply this wax. It's actually the watery kind, not the pasty kind, which I had trouble workng in due to its thickness.I used to wax like clockwork and my black car did look HOT! Just spray and wax on, wax off in circles with a soft, white cloth. No smelly fumes either."
2,New smell not so good,"I have used Turtle Wax for several years. The last batch I bought now has a new scent which smells toxic. I've written the manufacturer but they never responded. I know that smell may not seem important. However, when you are washing your car both in and out as I do, the toxic smell of the new product is a turn off. I guess it's time to find a new wax.Any ideas would be appreciated.FC"
4,A MUST HAVE FOR THE SIZE,"This digital camera has alot of features that are very nice considering the size.Not to happy with the software it comes with and wished they included a case with the camera.But over all the camera alone is well worth it,easy to carry anywhere and takes very nice pictures a must have for every day use or just for those special occasions.Seem to be very durable and cool assecories like the under water cover for those pictures on a vacation or at a event in the rain."
5,Can't go wrong,"The other reviews have said enough about the cool features and good image quality of this entry-level digital camera. I just want to emphasize its excellent quality. My family has a total of three digital cameras by Canon and also a Rebel SLR bought years ago, and all exhibit the highest level of quality control. You can't go wrong with a Canon."
1,Very Poor Picture Quality,"...Pros: Stylish design; Convenient to hold; Easy to use; Good close up picture quality; Good LCD; Immediate shutter response; Easy to lear manual.Cons: Cannot focus under any conditions on anything half a meeter away from the camera; Very apparent artifacts. Everything in the picture including yourself looks like a poster; Very flat and poor feeling of the colors on indoor pictures; After downloading the pictures from the camera to the PC and checking the pictures on the PC, I was so disappointed; Also experienced a bug the first installing the software. Compared side by side with some pictures taken by a Fuji Finepix 40i, Fuji does a much much much better job.Conclusion: Good for show and tell, not for taking pictures. Canon seems not worth its reputation. How did it get it?"
4,upgraded to s200 from s100,"I used to own an s100, and my decision to get an s200 was based on the great service I got while using the s100. The size is a factor, cause I like to travel light and not bulky. The pictures are great and easy to take, just point and click. I will be a Canon customer for a long time most likely. I dont give it 5 stars only because I couldn't tell how to turn the flash off and instruction booklet was not handy, but I needed the shots. It was a one-time chance for shots in an old ante-bellum home on a tour where we could not use flash, but they only told us after starting the tour! So I tried to figure it out using the LCD menu but it's just to complicated to turn off flash. It should be duh-duh simple for users like me. So I had to miss a lot of interior shots."
4,Small and Super Sassy..,Small and Super Sassy is the best way to explain this camera. The size is the best thing about it. I can put it in my pocket and take it anywhere. It takes great pictures for a 2.0 MP camera. I used Ofoto to get the pictures printed on kodak paper and you can't tell they are digital pictures. The only downfalls are the 8MB memory card they provide you with and getting used to the life of the lithium battery. Amazon helps with one of these downfalls by providing you with a free 64MB memory card that makes all the difference. All I want to add now is a carry case and few spare memory cards. I highly recommend this to someone looking to buy their first digital camera.
2,"Camera is GREAT, zoom stinks.","Pros:*Small and compact.*Decent picture quality.*Very solid, quality construction.*Feature laden camera.*Excellent software & documentation.*Looks great, nice feel.Cons:*Zoom stinks!*You need to walk forward ten feet to a quarter-mile to zoom this camera.Note:I use this camera as my ""second"" digital camera (""first"" is an Olympus C3040) - great for snapshots, not for anything that requires any hint of a ZOOM. I love this camera!"
5,More features and fun than expected,"I read every review I could get my hands on about this camera and am glad I did, because everyone is right about the S200, it is great. Some reviewers said you couldn't turn off the flash, well you can. The camera comes with a good user guide and also good software. I was shooting pictures in about 15 min. and downloading to my computer in about a hour. This is my 2nd digital camera and it is far superior to my 1mp HP 100 which 2 years ago cost me about the same. The s200 elph has a nice solid feeling. I feel that I have made an excellent choice in digital photograpy."
4,"Great camera, needs better batteries","Great size -- I make photographs more often because this is easy to carry. Great pictures -- for the sake of file size, I don't need more than 2 Mbyte. Good ruggedness -- the metal case protects the camera well and looks good. Bad battery life -- I have two rechargeable batteries and usually need both to fill up a 32 MByte compact-flash card with about 50 photos using the LCD display. I recognize that the small size of the camera is made possible by smaller batteries, and smaller batteries mean shorter battery life, but the battery life limits the usefulness of the camera."
2,"Great pics, pain in the behind","I bought this camer 2 months ago and fell in love with it...until: the auto focus became finicky and it took 3-5 seconds to take a picture, the battery life and auto power down function became finicky, the lense would not always retract when powered down, the pictures instantly became fuzzy and ""whited out"" like bad reception on a TV (tech support could not solve) yet the video worked, the sound on the video began giving everyone speaking a lisp. My camera is now on it's way to canon repair services, I hope I get back a new camera because I think I got the Jaguar of the digital camera industry."
5,ready to go!,"i brought and reviewed this camera three weeks ago. here's the update. AMAZING!!!i go out three nights in a row without charging and it still takes pics...with flash. it has actually never died on me. and i pound this puppy. gone are the days of my dissapointed semi-narcasistic friends who i can't show them the pics right away for fear of the dreaded ""red battery light"". i am only too happy to show them the shots..and the zoom function where you can zoom the image.this camera is everything i wanted. small. easy to use. automatic and manual, great features for even a pro user. but above all this little guy has AMAZING picuture quality. even at 8x10. clear, with no ""digital coldness"".It really is time to make the switch and this camera will make you beleive in technology again! one comment, spend the cash on a matching Canon printer that prints direct. wish i did, but then again i do have iPhoto with OS X.2.to end: a VERY happy camper."
4,Great little camera,"Easy to use for technophobes, takes great pictures, portable, durable. Only issue is sometimes there is a delay in the camera that makes it hard to get one shot right after another. I haven't found the setting to control that, and maybe there is one, but I'm not sure. Also, it seems to take a while when pressing the button to have it flash sometimes, so if you have an active child, you may want a camera with a more sensitive button."
4,Quick and Dirty Lowdown,Pros:Small size!! Good quality photos for casual use. Lots of manual controls. Optical Zoom present. TV output useful.Cons:Heavy for it's small size. Takes some time to turn on/power up. Battery life could be better. Cheap plastic battery and memory card door cover (broke easily). Weak flash. Telephoto/wide angle trigger gets stuck with use. 8MB memory card it comes with is absolutely useless (I gave mine away).
4,For Most Users,"This is my 3rd digital camera and by far and away the most simple to use. I have found the digital quality to be excellent. Downloading my pics is fast and easy with the software that comes with this unit. I believe this is a great buy for 90% of digital users who just want to take pics of their friends and family. Before deciding on this camera, I looked at many ratings of digital camera's on several different websites. I talked to several people in a variety of retail stores deciding that most did not know a camera from a pogo stick. And lastly I talked with many of the people I know who own more expensive models. What I found out was that the folks who buy more features and megapixels...generally don't use their camera for anything more than I do. I just got back from Vegas and believe that some of the pics I took are as good if not better than the postcards I saw. I would rate this product a smart buy."
5,Excellent Camera,"This camera is tiny, but has everything. I highly recommend it.A great feature is the video clips. You can take short video (*.avi) clips as if you were taking a photo. So you have instant short movie clips that you can view, or email."
2,Just a toy,"It's true that Canon S200 is compact, pretty, and well-designed. However, it turns up side down when talking about picture quality. I took some night shots and found unaccpetable outcomes. Usually, I don't use flash for night shots in order to get the atmosphere as much realisitc as I can into my pictures. Pictures from this camera look blur and grainy. Two Megapixel and three-point focus system don't seem to help. Transferring pictures to a computer is another headache. Unlike any other cameras, there is no direct access to a camera from Windows Explorer. I have to install 20 mb software and driver into Windows XP. After using for 30 minutes, I decide to return it. If you are a serious photographer, look for something else."
5,Pocket camera takes amazing picures,"This replaces all my other cameras. This sturdy, pocket size digital camera takes amazing point and shoot instant pics, and has a plethora of options you can set on the small, but high quality digital display. Sensitivity, color depth and resolution are great for high-quality prints up to 5x7. Available light pictures are very good if you hold the cameras steady while shooting. Flash images tend to have strong reds, but correct easily with any digital image processing program, including the one supplied with the camera. Don't forget to set your printer's paper and color Properties. Set the colors to match your monitor and it will be much easier to make any minor corrections to the exposure and color of each print."
5,I love this camera,"This camera is awesome! I've had mine for about 6 months now and I've been so happy with it. I'm not a camera junkie or professional photographer so this is perfect in that it's small, affordable and has all the features that I'd ever need.Very easy to interface with the computer to download images or the TV for easy viewing. You'll want to get at least a 256MB card for all the pictures that you'll take with this great camera."
5,Pulsar watch,"Love my new watch! Just need to have some links removed, as it is a little big!Arrived just fine!"
5,A word from the singer,If you want a copy of the CD send me $8 postage paid and I wil get you a copy with the rough artwork. Don't get ripped off. Just email me at info@nakedlunch.com for the details or check out the site at http://www.nakedlunch.comcheersTom (Mxyzptlk)
3,Second Chance,Thought I wouldn't be getting much use out of this book but after reading these rave reviews decided to give it a second look. I tried several recipes but found them to be very salty especially the Black Bean Soup.Same for the Greek Lamb & Bean Stew as well as Italian Country Lamb & Whiite Bean Stew. Guess I will have to try some of the recommendations here. I was getting ready to purchase yet another PC cookbook as great method of cooking so will put that on hold and give this book a second chance. Hope all turns out as well as expected!
3,Wrinkles & creases,"The product description says: ""Fabric - The new double-sided FlexDrop is made from a new fabric that will not wrinkle!"" However, when I took the backdrop out of the box & carrying case, it was very wrinkled and creased. I have been letting it hang for 24 hours, and the wrinkles and creases are still pretty bad. It came with no instructions. Everything else is as described. I was a bit disappointed."
5,Loved it. Tells it like it is.,"This is an account of the boyhood of David Hunter, a retired police officer from Tennessee. He is now a columnist for the Knoxville News-Sentinel. His book touches the heart, truly, with its frank account of his humble beginnings, which have culminated with him as published author of some six - eight books, I've lost track. His other books are about his police experiences, and will make you laugh and cry. His stories are funnier than any cop stories I've ever read, and more true to life than anything of Wambaugh's (they ARE true, every one but JigsawMan, which is a fictionalized account of a true story). Read the other books, they're even better than this one."
5,super 40 minutes,"This is agreat super 40 minute workout. It has 5 people(3 women and 2 men) total in the video on top of a roof great for beginners or not depends on how hard you want to work yourself. I have it and have used it every day for two months. It also monitors your breathing and how hard your working, love that part of it."
4,Good condition - wish it were a DVD instead,"This is a good workout (kind of dated) but fun nonetheless. I thought I was ordering a dvd, but apparently I wasn't paying attention. It's good for middle-age people like me that can't keep up with a real fast-moving workout - this one is fast enough!"
1,It is a good book but...,"The price isa my only problem, everywhere I went it was expensive, a lot of old chacters though, and I liked that, (Mainly from Bacta War) But in the X-Wing series (Written by Micheal A. Stackpole & Aaron Allston) were bigger and cost half of the price! For some reason that doesn't make since. But like I said, This book is an excellent book, and I also believe that if they cut their prices they might actually start selling more and getting more $$$$$$$$$$$ That's always important right? I'm probably going to read the whole series, but I'll do my best to wait and see if they go down in prices."
3,"Tycho and Winter, love on sultry Tatooine?","This is actually the second TPB of this series collecting issues 9 to 12. volume 1 was poorly done and never made a TPB. Volume 2, The Phantom Affair, TPA, had as its only real flaw a drab cover. Battleground Tatooine, BT, has a spectacular Cover and then the rest is a slight drop off in comparison with TPA. Nadeau's pencil work lacks some of the detail and there are many more lazy artist panels in TB vs TPA.Story gets a 4, Cover a 5, Pencils 3.5, ink and coloring a 3.5 for a grade of 3 stars.Key players in this comic areCapt wedge Antilles, Lt. Tycho Celchu, Elscol Loro, Admiral Ackbar, Lt. Wes Janson, Dllr Nep, Plourr Ilo, Hobbie Klivan, Windmere Wellen, the blond after wedge, Winter, with grey hair who is interested in Tycho, Huff Darklighter, Ko'Shak, Cazne'olan, Sixtus Quin, and Kapp Dendo.The story here sets but some events in the Bacta War book.The story here sets but some events in the Bacta War book."
2,Disappointing,"Thi sisn't even for die hard fans unless they have money to throw away. The art was passable but the story was weak, devoted mainly to action with little support. Even the characters who weren't created just for the comic (Wedge Antilles, Bib Fortuna, et al.) all acted about the same. I recommend picking up Dark Empire if you want a good Star Wars graphic novel instead of this."
1,Did not last long,The bib broke within a few weeks of receiving it. The plastic strap that is used to hold the bib closed snapped off during normal use.
1,The worst,"I expected to get 5 bibs, as the picture showed 5 bibs, I received one. Ok maybe I'm an idiot. It took my 18 month old less than a week to have the ""pouch"" cracked and leaking onto his lap. I wish someone would make one of these that lasted. I purchased a similar bib at the dollar store for -a dollar- and that lasted for months, too bad they don't stock them anymore."
5,Great camera for the price,"It's amazing what this thing can do. I am still learning how to use all the features! You get a digital camera, camcorder, and mp3 player all in one. The only complaint I have is that it's hard to adjust the flash. Other than that I give it 5 stars because it's small and easy to carry, reasonably priced, and produces high quality images/videos."
2,Full of mistakes,"It looks like this book was written hastily. Misspellings and clumsy use of language clutter the pages. I am sure nobody read this book thoroughly before it was published. It refers to a CD several times in the text, but there is no CD included. On the last page it refers to a website for source code - nothing there. Its title is ""Visual Studio .NET,"" while most of the text is about a zillion of other topics. The examples are simple but they are needlessly verbose and contain cut/paste errors. The MCAD/MCSD Self Paced Training Kits offer much more quality and cover Visual Studio much more thoroughly."
5,Great Examples,"This book offers tons of sample code that actually works. Some of the examples introduce new ways of looking at the middle tier such as implementing the middle tier as a combination of assemblies, Stored Procedures, and XML. I believe the author did a great job of teaching how all these technologies are implemented with Visual Studio.NET.The book also covers Enterprise Services which I have had a hard time finding good documentation."
3,Cute!,My four year old will love this. My two year old loved it as well. The illustrations are bright and kept his attention. Super cute story.
2,Can't open on certain kindles,"I purchased this book in kindle format for my husband, it is all that everyone says it is: cute, good for all ages. But did you know that you have to have iOS 6 point something or greater to read this book? He has iPad 2, has installed all the available upgrades, and has updated kindle, all to no avail. I am still working on it, and it still is not working. I went back to the book description, and did not see any notation that the book might not be able to be read on certain devices. That's the reason for the low rating."
5,I'll remember this one,"What can you say? I found one of my kids reading this book to his little brother first thing in the morning today -- it is really cute. They were laughing their socks off. The little love poems in the story, the slug-slime-writing, the way the slugs differentiate themselves from one another -- ""I think she's the brownish one."" ...but they all looked a little brown. The illustrations are hilarious -- the eyestalks and slug-accessories crack me up. This book is a winner."
4,Fun!,"Susan Pearson, Slugs in Love (Marshall Cavendish, 2006)Cute little tale of a slug who becomes infatuated with another slug, and lets him know with poems scribbled around the barnyard. Good intro to rhythm and rhyme for the kiddies, with an amusing mistaken-identity subplot tossed in for good measure. You'll like this one as much as your kids will. ***"
4,"It rocks, jumps, rolls and seduces","A small, subway band from the Midwest - has moved in a created a passionate following. This is the cd that started it all. This is one of those cd's that has a lot of sounds, all in one. You will rock, jump and roll. A lot of vocals - outrageous vocals, peppered with drums, guitar and horn. I lost my original and literally have been stalking music stores for years to find another copy. Thanks to Amazon.com for fufilling a dream."
4,A Useful book,"This book is, as far as I am aware, the only sustained academic treatment of Charles Parham's ministry. It is a very useful study that helpfully contextualises into his social climate. Therefore, Goff goes some way to cast doubt on the common portrayal of Parham as a overt Racist; relative to his time he was not. As well as being a biography of Parham Goff makes a case for arguing that Parham is the clear ""Projector"" of Pentecostalism in his theological prescription of Xenoglossa (note: not glossolalia) as this initial evidence of the Holy Spirit's Baptism. The xenoglossa accounts for Goff's argument that Parham's Pentecostalism was a missiological one.I would however note that the debate of pentecostal origins could have been covered in more depth as a greater survey of subsequent pentecostal appraisals of his work. Overall though this was an enjoyable and informative read."
4,"Excellent ""written"" guide....","This simple book is written clearly and with adequate illustrations to give Segovia's ""tips"" to classical guitarists."
1,Weak,"I was quite disappointed with this book. Perhaps for the ABSOLUTE beginner it would be beneficial, but for anyone who has been playing for more than a month or so, I don't think that this is even enough material for a toilet read."
2,Must be balmy for this.,"This product has no smell what ever. No soothing effect that I could feel. It is a total waste! I love Drakkar Noir, but this is a waste of money. Get the regular after shave, it smells like Drakkar, but it is hard to find. I will never buy the balm again!!!"
3,"Wonderful classic man's scent, but too thin","I first used Drakkar Noir before you were born when you had to buy it in France. So anyway, this is an OK after shave balm, but it should be much thicker. It's too runny."
2,was not what I expected,"If you are looking for the balm in a bottle this is not for you! Even though thats what the pic shows, when I received it it was a small tube of balm. I have always gotten the balm for my husband & it's always come in the bottle. Not sure if it's been repackaged but the picture is VERY deceiving! Kept it only because my husband said it would be OK and he really needed it."
2,2nd coffee pot,the 1st one i ordered had a broken piece- the 2nd pot that was sent out was defective - the white rim on the pot held water from the dishwasher- when it heated up making the coffee- the water was released all over the heating element & the counter - i called conair & they stood behind it & are currently sending out a new glass pot
2,Doesn't fit newer water bottles.,"Do not purchase if you plan to use on the newer water bottles that have the ""short"" tops and smaller caps these days. They don't work with those."
2,Not really good,i bought it a long time. but i find out it not fit on all the water bottle. my son use this us toys now. thats not even usuful for me. i won't buy again. waste money.
1,Leaks on the water bottles we have,"I wanted to love this. it it such a good idea. It may work fine for everybody else, but ours leaks."
1,Doesn't Fit,With the changes to water bottle this no longer fits. The up side is the nipple will work on the on the go formula bottles.
1,This does not work!,"This is a good idea, if it worked. It does not work, it leaks all over the place. Don't waste your money."
5,bella and gizmo's adventures,"BUY THIS BOOK...IT IS WONDERFUL! My husband has been going through cancer treatment and lost his hair due to the chemo. This book is fantastic for us to read to our four children (ages 13-11-8-3)....it helps my kids to understand that Daddy is the same person, and 'it's what's on the inside that matters, not the loss of his hair'....this really opened up family discussions a great deal. I went to [...]website and read the AUTHORS BIOGRAPHY....she really lost all her hair, too, and really understands people well...KUDOS TO THE AUTHOR, MS.JODI PLISZKA....you are great and helped our family out a lot! We all can't wait to read the next books in your series.. All my kids want the stuffed animals of BELLA and GIZMO. We can't wait to buy them. THANKS! FIVE STARS FOR SURE!"
5,Bella and Gizmo's Adventures,"This book is excellent and very eye-opening! I am a Guidance Counselor and I am going to purchase these books for our school programming. There aren't many books that try to break that ""barbie doll stereotype"" and I think this book does that. This will be great to teach kids that people are different, and it truly is ""what's on the inside that matters"" not what someone looks like...sex, age or race. I will rate this with FIVE BIG STARS and a GOOD JOB to the author! This book is awesome."
3,Not quite as advertised,"Filling is 75% down, not 100% as advertised. After a bit of fluffing, ~3-4 feathers fell out. Not sure how that compares to other down comforters. Otherwise feels nice, but since it's dry-clean only, I reccomend a duvet cover (which defeats the purpose of microsuede)."
2,Sheds feathers!,"At first I loved this item. It was very comfortable and you could not beat the price. Then, less than a month later, I started to notice the comforter started to ""shed"" from the inside out. I even purchaced a duvee cover to try and remedy the problem but it only slowed the process slightly. I have since discarded the comforter, two months ago, and am still trying to get rid of all the down feathers in my apartment. Maybe I had a flawed comforter but I am highly sceptic of that assumption. The down is very small and seems like it would happen eventually with all of these. So if you only want a comforter for a month or wish to piss someone off this is ideal for you."
2,"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs....","This book has too many bugs for a beginner to figure out. Has a few good ideas and examples, though... Just don't expect them to work on the first try. I am very disappointed...."
2,Not for Beginners,"Database programming is the bread and butter of most VB programmers. And this book will sort of help improve the art. I say ""sort of"" since it forces the reader to practice debugging. The errors abound - from dated nomenclature and concepts to out right bad (and broken) code. On the positive side, I liked reading the authors' many simple and concise explanations of several tough topics, like the Jet DB and SQL a la VB5. Overall, I think the book is useful, albeit expensive given the poor techincal quality."
2,Needed to be edited more thoroughly for sure!,"I just finished Day 5 after spending two entire days on it. Many, many errors were present. A few of which I am still not sure are resolved. The examples in the book are riddled with errors. The only way to be sure is to check the code on the CD. Even then there is no certainty it will work as it should. So far it has been a great tool for learning. Fixing all the mistakes has definitely made me more aware of Visual Basic itself. I managed to clip through ""Teach Yourself Visual Basic 5 in 21 Days"" by Nathan and Ori Gurewich. I found it to be more error free. I wish I could only say the same for this one. More care needs to be taken when editors rush through these books on the newer software. This one was obviously glossed over very poorly."
2,And I thought it was just me!,"This is the second book I've bought on VB, the first one being an introductory book on everything I need to know about the basics of VB. But since I wanted to focus on database programming, I bought this book and read through it, confused most of the time. Running the sample codes didn't help either. I thought it was only my inexperience with the language that is causing the trouble, thank goodness I found that the other more experienced readers of the book also had similar experiences. I tried swallowing the text up until Chapter 10 and then I finally gave up. If you ask me how I would describe the writing and organization of this book, frustrating would come to mind. I finally gave up and bought another book!"
3,"strong in some aspects, weak in others","I did learn about Crystal Reports and Visdata through this book. And there were some coding errors. I think the price was a bit. Should you buy this book? Visit a bookstore, thumb through it and decide for yourself."
1,Please connect sql with visual basic!,"I wrestled with this book for weeks. I thought I was crazy. Then I got a book on sql, and things developed a bit.The problem with the book is that it teaches a bit of sql, but never hooks it up to visual basic. Maybe it does somewhere, but darned if I can find it.Lots of stuff, but all disconnected. And all that money......."
1,It does teach database programming with VB5.,"This book is sloppy, buggy, and a lot of the code doesn't work, but it can be worth the effort, especially, when it's necessary to port an MS Access application to VB5.The included CD ROM has a lot of useful code which either works or I was able to fix and get working. As an Access developer for many years, I've found it very difficult to come up with good reasons for porting applications to VB . . . but, apparently there are . . . which is why I plowed through this book that I strongly recommend (???) with lots of reservations. The stuff is useful!Sams should try and figure out how to do ""right"" by its customers as the book really is a mess. What they've produced here is not much more than a first draft!My advice is to use a pencil to mark all the mistakes."
4,Excellent source for beginners,"I found this book to be a very good source for database programming, especially for beginners. I not only went through all 21 days of lessons but also return to the book frequently as a help resource."
1,Don't buy it!,To echo many of the other reviews this book is horrible. The example code is riddled with mistakes and the explinations of the code become shorter and shorter as the book progresses. By the time I reached chapter 10 Im spending much more time reading VB5 help screens than I am reading the book.
1,Disappointing; does not live up to its title,"I have read many programming books over the years, and about 5 Visual Basic 5.0 in the past few months. I found this one to be very confusing, the code to be very buggy, and writing to be inconsistent from one chapter to another. Not recommended."
4,"Perfect camera, but lacks zooming feature.","I've had this camera for several years, and I love everything about it! It's very easy to use and the flash is great- it illuminates a dark room and takes clear pictures. Very compact and cute, even now, several years later! The only missing feature is a zoom, which is why I only give it four stars instead of five, but the picture come out nice and large enough to adjust to your liking. Unfortunately, it's also not compatible with the newer memory sticks since it came out before them, but that's not too much of a problem for me. I also own the cybershot DSCL1, which has more fancy features but does not illuminate as well and takes pictures more blurry than the U20. I also like it that the batteries are rechargeable and relatively cheap to get. It comes with a charger too, and the battery life is great! Also a nice beginner's digital camera, or for the kids!"
5,I love this camera.,"but for some reason. now I want s200 or s230. compactness is so addictive. help!BTW: 3 times zoom doesn't come out crispy clear as 2 times or no zoom. so I avoid zooming in all the way when I take photos now.(yes, I have do have digital zoom turned off)everytime I pass by shalves displaying s200, I just think it's cuter and so much smaller. fits in pocket better without bulging so much. thinking to myself, I should've invested in smaller casing than extra zoom that I don't use."
1,Hoped that this S330 would be my first digital camera,"Considered this Canon S330 as my first digital camera. I just checked Canon's web site and found out that this camera is not fully compatible with Mac OSX. There are numerous other Canon's that are, but why isn't this NEW Canon model up to speed??? I really wanted to add this digital camera to my collection of Canon 35mm cameras."
5,Lightweight Portable Killer,"I have been searching for a digital camera for over a year now. I have been close to buying many. Including Olympus, Sony and Kodak. None of them offered the portability and durabilty and yet maintained the picture quality I needed. When I saw the s330, I finally realized what I had been searching for... Great picture quality, digital/zoom, extremely portable and durable. Not to mention 2 megapix is way more than enough unless your thinking of starting a professional photo career. The pictures come out spotless everytime... Just shoot and put it back in your pocket. Another great feature is the battery charger... completely foldable in one piece. No cord involved, just plug directly into the wall. This is the ultimate travel package! Not to mention the additional speaker over the s300 model and the lower price tag, you have a winner here. Upgrade to the 128 MB card... I am averaging over 400 pics a card on medium resolution! Happy shooting friends!"
5,Excellent quality rugged camera,"Everyone wrote enough about it, so I will only add that this camera worked much better than expected for quite a long time, until during last trip, I dropped it really hard on cement.The shutter button came out, the case kind of split in half (could see the guts inside), and of course the door for the memory card broke and the battery came off... I just pushed the camera back together and it snapped in place (kind off, still see inside), put back the shutter button (without the spring that came off which I lost), scotch taped the memory card door, and the camera seemed to work fine. Actually we finished the vacation taking pictures with it for a few more days. No quality difference noticed between the picture from before the accident and after.Now I am back, unfortunately it would be too expensive to fix it, so I guess will buy another ELPH, perhaps 3-4M pixels and if it will be anything like this one, I am sure I will not regret it."
4,Nice little Camera but......,"The Canon S330 is a nice camera for outdoor photography. Real easy to handle and gives you great pictures even without reading the manual. Pictures are nice and sharp and colors are vivid. Software installation (on Windows XP Home) was a breeze and camera communication with the PC was seamless. My complain with the camera is indoor photography though, especially flash photography. The flash range is fairly limited and the edges of the photograph tend to be dark. And with the camera zoomed out to 3x, indoor photography is next to impossible without a tripod or flash. It has a lot customizations I could care less for (My camera settings). Overall, I would say that the S330 is a cool camera to own but for the slightly more serious photographers, the 35mm SLRs still rule, if don't mind carrying a lot of gear that is!"
4,"Much to love, but red-eye reduction hasn't been reliable","... I am a novice to be sure, and hemmed and hawed for months about whether to go digital or get a regular film point-and-shoot. I'm very glad I got this camera, and it takes absolutely stunning & lovely outdoor shots; however I'm a little bummed at the efficacy of the red-eye reduction feature. Many of my indoor evening shots of friends look as if they were taken at a Satan worshipper's convention. I suppose I can clean this up in post-production, if ever I figure out how to do that, but I wish this feature worked better."
5,Accessories,"This is in addition to my other review of this excellent camera.I forgot to mention the accessroies for this,1. Get one or two extra Canon NB-1LH batteries. This is the most important thing will need one a long day. (Don't get the older NB-1L, it had 25% lower capacity).2. Get a Canon PSC-300 Soft Compact Case for this.3. Spend some money and get either a 128MB or 256MB CF card. 128MB should me enough for most people.4. CF card reader is NOT needed, the USB cable that comes with the camera works perfectly fine.Buy only Canon branded battery/case for this camera, don't try the cheap imitations in the market. Same for CF card, buy only a branded one..."
5,AWESOME!!! Great things do come in small cases!!!,"A friend of mine had brought a S-110 Elph to South Africa last summer. I was amazed at that a camera so small could take such great pictures. I bought the S-200, but called Amazon and upgraded to the S-330 before the S-200 shipped. I am no camera buff, but the S-330 is pure fun to play with. I feel I cannot mess up a picture.... Also Stephen Wildstrom in Business Week (4/12/2002) reviewed the Kodak Dx-4900 and Nikon CoolPix 2500, but in his conclusion he came back to his good old Elph s-110 as his pocket digital camera of choice. If you are on a fence about buying the S-330 you will not be after reading these reviews!FYI- I wondered how much the S-330 weighs with the battery and 128 flash card, well it weighs 9.5 ounces. I was looking at bidding for the camera on [line], but the finally bids were often about the same as the Amazon.com price or even more. Plus I just like to buy from Amazon."
4,S330 Digital Camera,"I've had this for a two weeks now. I selected the Canon for its small pocket size and 3x optical zoom. I keep it in my shirt pocket for immediate accessiblilty to photograph items and places at work. The S330 is not as slim as I wanted, but I chose it for its 3x optical zoom over the S200's 2x optical zoom. The all stainless steel exterior is a work of art. A little heavier and bulkier than I wished for, but the controls are simplier to use than my Nikon Coolpix 880 and the LCD display superior to my Coolpix 880. The tripod socket is not centered on the axis of the lens but is located at the far leftside. Sweet little camera. Somewhat bulky for my shirt pocket, so I ordered the Canon PSC-300 Soft Compact Case. Images are good to excellent for a 2 megapixel pocket (sorta big pocket) camera."
1,Where is the price,Where is the price of this camera? I couldn't find it anywhere even if I did follow what people said on the screen.
3,Watch out for connecting with you computer,"The model has many great features. I am going to point out two areas where I am disappointed for your reference:1. I have 3 computers with different operating systems: Win98, 2000, and XP. First I noticed that the camera couldn't be connected through UBS as a remote drive. You have to use the provided Canon software to link it. After several efforts of installing and uninstalling the software, I could only make the Win2000 linked and had no luck with other two. I tried to download the latest drivers from the Canon Website and it didn't help. It is a nightmare to download the pictures.2. I could not find a way to moniter the battery power level except for the red warning sign when battery is almost gone."
5,Great Camera w/ Crisp picture,"I have this camera for over 1 year and I cannot be happier with it. The photo quaility is great both viewing on the computer and printing them into a photo paper. Although it maybe heavier than other camera, it's still small enough to fit into a pocket which makes carry around easy. Setting up the camera to upload the photo to my PC was easy. I had to install the driver provided when I was on Windows 2000 and no driver is require for Windows XP. I highly recommand this camera and make sure you get a bigger memory chip when you buy this camera."
5,Very easy to use,"I bought the first Elph that Canon offered years ago and have enjoyed using it. Lots of features in a very compact size. So when I started to look for a digital camera Canon was my first choice. While there are other cameras with more features, etc., the S330 does exactly what I need it for. Images are clear and the camera is easy to use. I have tested out all the features yet, but when it comes to point and shooting you are up and running without even reading the instructions. Definitely recommend this to the average user."
5,Precision like the other Incra-products,"There is not much to say about this product. It is very precise, enabling you to check those miters and get them perfect every time, ajusting tablesaw, bandsaw and other tools. It is solid made, one piece precesion milled block of aluminum, and will provide years of good service. Worth the money for an absolute 45dgr reference."
4,Good tool,"I don't have a precision weights & measure office in my neighborhood. But from the test I can run from my woodshop it seems to be dead-on. My one complaint is that the angle starts so high on the blade. To tune in my tablesaw, I have to crank the blade almost to max height before I can set it. That's real hassle when you have to switch between 90 and [precisely] 45 as much as I do. Otherwise its good (accurate, solid, easy to use...)."
2,the past,"Reparations will never make up for the past..what it will do is create an ugly world of charges and counter-charges! Will Black Americans blame to blame their fellow Africans, as well as Arab slave traders for creating a culture of slavery (remember that slavery is an African tradition). Will the families of White-Americans sue the families of Blacks for the crimes perpatrated on them? Reaprations will not solve anything, wont make test scores go up or create so-caled equality. In fact reparations will increase racism and I, for one, will join that ism..."
5,BUY IT!,"Let me see if I can summarize this CD and its strengths in fewer words than others. In Cantus Articus, Rautavaara blends classical music and bird calls together so well that you can close your eyes and picture yourself by the side of a marsh and soaring with swans. It doesn't need it, but it would work great with big-screen video in a symphony program. Piano Concerto No. 1 is truly described as ""straining for tonality."" The effect is that it is so close to romantic tonality as to be recognizably beautiful, but off-key and dissonant enough to be modern. It works. Symphony No. 3 is great. I can see the comparisons to Bruckner and the 3rd and 4th movements are heavy and stormy enough to give fans of Mahler and Bruckner a thrill. The strength of this CD is it incorporates three strong Rautavaara pieces and the sound isn't bad at all, despite what some say. Rautavaara is a great composer!"
5,Transcendant performance,"This CD is not only a terrific bargain, but having listened to several performances of the Cantus Arcticus, this one possesses the greatest majesty and power. Also the Piano Concerto and 3rd Symphony are interesting and occasionally great works, that take a little more effort on the part of the listener."
2,Get what you pay for,"I bought this camera back in July. I liked it, it took pictures just fine, was a good deal for $140.But it let me down. In Feb. the zoom lens jammed. The first thing this camera does when you turn it on is pop out the zoom, so this turned it into a brick. It is very difficult to get a person on the phone and not voicemail. I sent the camera to Vivitar. They also make you send a check for $5 for return shipping! A month later, I received a replacement. With a bad flash, although I can see how whoever inspecting missed it, because the flash does a weak blink. Now in late April, I'm still waiting for them to send me a mailing label to return the bad replacement, because I've already paid shipping twice and should not have to pay again. I've given up on Vivitar and bought a Nikon Coolpix 2100."
5,DISCUSTINGLY FUNNY!,"So funny, I made my husband highlight his favorites and then compared them with mine. Very funny! Great to review before going to parties."
3,I would skip !,When Seducing a Spy by Sari Robins was ok but not great. It took me forever to finish this book. The last 1/4 of the book was fast paced when the mystery was being solved.
2,Fits an adult size hand.....,This glove is cheaply made - which I expected but it is also one size fits all and fits me perfectly - not my 5 year old son.
4,Anakins costume glove,"My kid loved this, the only problems was that the clasps did not work, so they were loose and jingled and made the glove slide off pretty quickly, so we super glued them shut."
2,Anakin Glove,"We ordered this for Halloween with the Anakin costume. Childs One Size Fits All is not accurate. The glove is a better fit for an adult. Buckles do not snap, just hang there..."
4,Durable,For being a pretend glove I can't believe the substance to this one. It actually has weight to it and decorative features. Very nice dress up glove and my son loves it!
4,"Too big, but my son still has fun with it","The glove is just as seen in the photograph, made of some pleather fabric with nice little links-quality not too bad. This glove however, is too big for ANY young boy and possibly a grown woman. My son really wanted the glove to make his outfit complete and he really enjoys playing with it. He is able to keep it on without it falling off somehow, but I can see it being disappointing for many parents. I can usually alter many things, unfortunately this one would be too much trouble. My son really wanted the glove, I found it for less on Amazon and I prepped my son for possible disappointment: ""The glove may be too big, is that okay?"" No disappoint for a child if he knows what's coming. He's having fun with it and that's what really matters."
3,"Nice weight, feels quality, but didn't fit quite right","I am conflicted about giving this knob only 3 stars, but I'm going with my gut on this one. This fit my '06 Mazda Miata poorly - the knob did not extend down far enough, and left the leatherette material underneath of it flopping around with nothing to attach to. The red lettering on the knob also annoyed me, as I feel it detracts from the otherwise quality build and appearance of the product. All that said, I'll look at Razo products first the next time I want something like this."
2,Does not fit for scion tc 2011-2012,"I looked all over for a decent replacement shift knob and settled on this one. None of the research I did indicated it would be a problem. On the RAZO site it says compatible with reverse ring MT systems- I got the knob as a present- went to install it and the diameter of the ring on my car is larger than the RAZO knob so I am forced to return it.Honestly- it seems to be a solid product, and it's the only reason I gave it 2 stars. In hindsight what is the deal with the stickers included??I can only judge it based on the fact that the description is misleading and they should do more research to make sure if in fact the knob is compatible before putting a blanket product description on it. This is the type of thing which makes you not want to buy any products form a specific manufacturer."
3,this bike is ok,this bike was delivered by ups. box was coming apart. i assume it was poor handling by ups. some assembly was required. reading assembly instructions it was noted to take bike to specialist for final adjustments. no where on ordering site was this stated. that added to the purchase price. would not order bike online again.
5,Great Santa/Panthers hat!,I ordered 4. Two medium and two large. They fit perfect on all of us. They were very warm in very cold weather. The quality of the hat is outstanding. Great price too!! The Large were worn by men. The medium by 2 women.
2,Really difficult for little hands to string together,"Hello,I bought a classroom set (15) and the kids ages 6-11 really enjoyed painting it; however, when it came time to string everything together, I had to do it for all of them."
4,Fun craft,This was a fun little craft. Children paint the pre-made molds and then string it all together. Nothing really spectacular about it but it does make a very nice handmade gift for someone special.
2,Alright,I thought that there would be 2 for some reason but there is just 1 in a box. Just alright. Would not get again.
5,Good Craft Project,This is a Christmas gift for my great-granddaughter in Florida. I'm sure she will love putting it together and then hanging it.
3,Mother's Day gift,"Bought this for my 4 yr old daughter to give as a Mother's Day gift to her grandmother. It was easy for her to paint, but hard for me to put together. Just takes patience. Her grandmother really liked it!"
3,Nice rainy day project!,I bought this for my granddaughters and they really enjoyed making it (with my help... they are 4 and 3). It's a good craft project for a rainy day... but don't drop it and don't expect the young kids to be able to assemble it on their own.
3,Nice project for kids but hard to assemble,"My daughter and her friend enjoyed painting the pots for the windchime. However, the string for attaching the chimes is barely long enough which makes it somewhat difficult to put everything together. Definitely required adult assistance."
4,A great beginning,"If you're looking for the album that wraps up the Freddy Jones band in one nutshell, this is it.A great mix of both studio and live cuts that give you a great feel for their sound.If there is one drawback, it would be that you really have to be in the mood to listen to this album. A few of the tracks can drag on a little, and Wayne Healy's guitar can get to ear-piercing pitches at times. A little too much edge, that the band learned to lose in their future releases.If you're a fan of the Allman Brothers, and are looking to diversify your tastes just a little, give this one a shot."
5,Trust me!,"If you have an ounce of straight-up rock-and-roll musical taste in your blood or bones, you will LOVE this CD. It is the best Freddy disc and ranks in my top 5 CDs of all times. Others I rank high are Phish, Sting, Keb' Mo' and Kenny Wayne Sheppard. Buy it. Trust me."
5,freddy jones cd,"The cd was in great shape, wonderful price and was shipped in very timely manner. No complaits from me. Thanks"
5,FJB,"First and only FJB CD I own, if you are a FJB fan this is a must have. Outstanding CD, great music if you like this style."
3,Warning - Not Complete Book of Genesis,"The production is great - I have no problem with what was done. It's helpful to understand the text. But I was disappointed in what wasn't done. The title of the work is Genesis - so I thought it would be the whole book of Genesis. But this is not what it was. The story only stops off at Genesis 35 - before the Joseph section. This was very disappointing to me because I particularly wanted the Joseph story for a class I am involved with. Also, be aware that parts of Genesis before the Joseph story are missing. For example, Genesis 34 is entirely missing. Another example is that in Genesis 31, sections are not included - e.g., the story of Rachel stealing the household idols from her father Laban. The product description should be more clear."
3,NEW OR RECONDITIONED??????,"Bought this toaster 6-13-2007. It's a nice toaster for the time it lasted and the price I paid,$20. It just gave up on me. 12-19-2008. I would not recommend buying a reconditioned item. I would just spend a little more money and buy new."
1,"Uh, oh.","Didn't work. Second problem ""refurbished"" toaster from Cuisinart. May be the fault of the company that buys them and ""fixes them up."""
3,An average buy,"I bought this factory-reconditioned 4 slice toaster at a cheap price ($25 I guess). Even though the looks are good, performance is just satisfactory; some of the reasons for avg performance are given below:1. Uneven toasting2. One has to pull the lever up to pick the slices3. Takes longer than other toasters to perform the taskI recommend it value wise but its not a great buy."
1,TERRIBLE - SAFETY HAZARD HOLSTER - WON'T FIT CZ SP-01 SHADOW,"First of all, this holster DOES NOT FIT CZ SP-01 Shadow. The slide stop of the Shadow extends on the RHS and it won't clear the holster. I had to cut a channel along the outer side of the holster to clear the end of the slide stop!Second, this is a SAFETY HAZARD HOLSTER for a heavy gun like the CZ. Once the gun is holstered and attached onto belt, the weight of the gun would pivot toward your leg - pointing at the direction of your knees in the path of your femoral artery! I surely won't be using this holster in the range. The design of this holster is unequivocally flawed.STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOLSTER."
3,Never use,I bought this cables for my xbox360 and the very next day of arriving my mom got me a lcd screen with hdmi so i've never open the blister
3,Interesting Idea with So So Presentation,"I'm not a fan of the genre, but I enjoyed watching the flick. The concept was good and there were some moments that were truly well-done -- the vampire's erotic bed scene was mesmerizing. Overall, however, the film's indie origins were too evident. Some of the visual segues were too abrupt and distracting. I kept wondering: ""How did we get from there to here?"" ""How did it change from night to day in minutes?"" etc. Also some of the background details need to be watched carefully. Indie films are made on a hairline budget, but it doesn't cost anything or take any time to remove distracting items from the background, the room, etc., or to change the camer angle to avoid getting them in the frame. Example: The real estate box on the door of the vampire's house. Still, it was fun to watch as long as it wasn't taken too seriously. The people making it were obviously having fun. So should the viewer."
1,Worst movie ever,"This is the worst movie ever. I only watch the first story and then tossed the disc in the trash. I rather watch paint dry, or my hair grow. Mr Sparks should have his video camera taken away and go work at wal-mart. Please don't waste your time or money. I did."
5,Incredible live performace from a blues master,"This live album truly reflects the energy and emotion of his live performances. There is not a track on this album that would be considered less than spectacular. Highlights: Me and My Guitar - Unbeleivable guitar playing. Blue Sky/Abraham, Martin & John - A song that will almost bring you to tears. I was lucky enough to actually witness Ian playing this song live in Wichita, KS in 1995?. He does such great justice to this classic tune."
2,Mediocre,"The only reason I bought this cd was because I saw that Vashti Bunyan was featured on a couple of the tracks. After listening to it, I realized that it remained the only reason why I still own this cd. Overall I am disappointed, especially after having paid so much for so few songs."
2,All 4 were broken,All 4 were broken and I have not had the time to send them back. It does not make sense that they are not packaged properly. THis is the second time this has happened with the same product.
4,Issues with chipping,"I'm glad I read the previous review. I have owned a four piece set of Sango Splash plates and bowls and have also experienced issues with chipping. I have used the four piece set as my primary dinnerware for about 1 year now. Currently only two pices have become chipped, but from the sounds of it, I may be in for more issues. I will certainly be watching for future problems."
3,Short stories - fish,"This book has great stories inside hidden behind its chambers. Some of the stories include ""What do fish have to do with anything?"", ""Teacher Tamer"", ""The goodness of Matt Kaizer"" and many others. One of the books, ""The goodness of Matt Kaizer"" was about this kid who is a minister's boy and will do any ""left open"" dare. So, I DARE you to find out Matt Kaizer's future.Will it be good, bad, sad, humorous, or something else? The only way to find out is to read this DARING short story and some of Avi's other short stories."
3,What a weird book,"This book is not very good. It is an easy book, for like 5th graders, Avi is ok, but not one of his best books. The short stories a weird and I don't really like them. Some of them made no sense and wasn't fun to read. In some of them were very suspenseful, and I didn't want to put it down. I am not sure if he made all of these short stories up, since I remebered from so where else. The title is a very weird name for a novel about a lot of short stories. From a book reader that wasn't pleased."
5,Great introduction of the Baroque to children...,"I first heard Red Priest's Four Seasons on satellite radio and was impressed with their novel approach to the work. This is the first classical CD I've been able to get my children (ages 10 and 7)to listen to in the car without a minor mutiny on my hands. When they read the liner notes, they actually started listening for the birdsongs, bubbling streams, thunder, etc. I even caught my 7 yr old smiling and head bouncing to the pieces.I'd highly recommend this for anyone interested in introducing their kids to classical music -- they won't think its BORING!!! after listening to this..."
1,Outdated and Immature Internet Site Recommendations,"Published in 2000, this booklet is already, alas, outdated. For example, out of 15 searches, 2 sites were ""unavailable"" ...4 were out of business... several had pages ""in process""... one was too pale to read... some were impossible to navigate or didn't know how to respond ""this product is unavailable.""In short, out of 15 sites, only one recommendation was ""professional."" (yahoo.com)Some excellent sites were missing, like ewolfs for antiques.There is no index and many entries are simply repeated under different headings, so in fact there are fewer than 1600 recommended sites.Sorry, Ms. Welsh and McGraw-Hill! I know you worked on this for a long time... maybe you can publish another (indexed)edition when internet businesses stabilize."
4,Delightful stroy for young and old readers,"I first encountered this book when I was learning to read as a child. What marvelous motivation for a child to read with such an engaging story! Before Harry Potter and A Series of Unfortunate Events, before Goosebumps and The Babysitters club, this book was the insanely popular read. It is a wonderful tale of the magic of a teddybear's eye. Anybody, young or old, would be thrilled with this book."
5,Primed for the Olympics,Wow! What an exciting new Olympic sport!!! Awesome! I am going to follow Casey as he goes to the next X game and see how he does and if he can make it to the Olympics. Exciting footage!! Highly recommend for the Olympic buff or Skier. In fact good film for young racers to understand the mental edge you must have to complete.
3,When is system 2 coming out?,"I like Mark De Lisle's fitness products, especially Breakthrough to Master Level Fitness. This DVD is a good addition to that book and is quite effective as far as it does, especially for a beginner's workout.However, its supposed to be a build-up for more advanced Systems 2 and 3 etc. I brought the DVD over six months ago and nothing else in the series has come out - I think people will soon get bored with this DVD and will give up waiting for others in the series to come out."
3,Decent workout but lacks a few elements...,"There are no pullup exercises, I believe this to be a decent workout for someone trying to get back in condition. I did not like it for myself, I prefer to be able to do pull ups and work out slower, with no breaks between exercises in order to get the heart rate going (improves recovery and stroke volume), then follow it by intervals (sprints, bycicle sprints or jump rope intervals)."
3,Good to integrate with other workouts,"Good addition to other workouts such as Yoga, Pilates and weight training. Starting point for a beginner (in this genre, me.) Basic - but not easy - routine builds endurance and strength using your own body weight. The separate instruction on exercise form is very good. The ITB (illiotibial band) stretch during the warmup... isn't. See this url for a good ITB stretch. http://www.rice.edu/~jenky/sports/itband.html The absence of a brief stretch at the end of the workout is a gap. After the workout, consider stretching psoas, ITB, quadriceps, calves and chest - even if you are playing ""Pretend""."
4,excellent training,I'm an ex marathon runner....now I train for the pure fun...believe me this program is simple to use and it will bring you to a good level in your fitness.....
2,Great workout to get back in shape.,Great dvd. I tried it for about a three weeks really didn't do much for me since I do the Bas Rutten MMA Workout on CD and through in Matt Furey's Combat Conditioning. Those programs are so challenging. I would recommened it to someone that is trying to get back in shape since it great for overall conditioning if you have had a long layoff from workingout.
5,Excellent!,Really great in every way!I want to wish Mark the best of health and a complete recovery.Thanks Mark!
3,Fair,"I had purchased this video because nothing else seemed stimulating.....and being prior military, I figured it would be what I was accustomed to. I have found myself bored with it after 2 weeks. I took things from it that I wanted, and turn on my own music to work out.It DOES cause a good burn, and make you work....good to start out with, and get into a routine with. It did not, however, keep my attention."
5,Good buy,"We've had this recharger for over a year now and it has worked great for us every time. I recharge two for our camera, the one that came with the set and a different brand and they both seem to recharge well. It does take several hours, but they say that makes a 'better' charge than those quick ones anyway. So I always keep a spare set of alkalines in my camera bag just in case the charge runs out during a prime photo moment, which isn't often. We keep our LCD off pretty much all the time to save the charge and our batteries seem to last a few months before I need to recharge them."
4,Models from past cycles,The season is pretty good. It is very cool because they are models from the past cycles. Watch the cycle! At first I thought I wasn't going to enjoy it but I did! I still did like the past normal cycles better thought thats why I gave it 4 stars.Thank YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Mr. ayers,at it again","Not a bad dvd, considering, It would be nice to see the artists with their orininal bands.What I'd like to know is where is all the archives of these great artists in there prime. But still a great look at a great artist.check it out.The Vibe is still here.ciao"
1,Horrible & uncomfortable. Better off with a torn sheet home made.,I tried to wear one of these for my separated shoulder. The neck strap is so narrow that the weight of my on the strap caused it to dig in to my neck. I found it unwearable.
2,"""Too Much Ocean""","Well, I had waited with great anticipation for this one. had some hardcore blues many nights thinking about jeffrey lee pierce after he died. but there's nothing there, man. The lyrics without the songs behind them carry so much less power. It's surprising to see how vague and imcomplete they feel when read. Most read like one offs, not the powerful statements you hear on the records. And yet, it's great to have them. The power, the book proves, is in the music of the Gun Club . . . the presentation, the fierce heart . . .but the heart, the book shows, was inarticulate in most ways outside the music. It's a one-day read, really slight. It rambles. It's juvenile, high schoolish. There is some insight into the punk chaos (you had to be there to know Pierce hits this chord right), but is that enough? Just not a lot of book here, I'm afraid. For the most faithful of the faithful. Everyone else, please, buy the records."
5,LOOKS GREAT!!,"Great fit. earlier I bought another one (OEM kind) for my other car and just wasn't able to fit it on, what a frustration :( So when I was considering to buy this one I was a bit skeptical, but hey - this is why they have good return policy. When I placed it on the car it fitted as a glove or should i say le-bra :) Installed in a few minutes too. Now, year later still looks great and sit tight."
5,"Nostalgia ,,,Manny Manuel does it again","Manny Manuel does it again :even do this is not the way he started his musical journey and because of the Banco Popular Specials (were he made Querube once again Popular )People were asking him to go into the Boleros, I love his voice and the choice of songs and im very happy he made serenata (his previous album and Nostalgia ) i love all his music but Nostalgia and Serenata are not only a remembrance of the golden era but also part of his Puertorican heritage"
5,I love this CD!,"I was blown away by this CD! Several of the songs are totally stuck in my head now, like ""The Sun Sets."" Impressive independent debut."
2,"decent folk sound, don't care for the pop","She's got a soothing voice suited for folk, but on a couple tracks seeks a pop sound that is rather generic. If you can tolerate chick-pop you might give this album 3 stars.Nice voice, great emotion, bland song writing."
1,I'd give it a 0 if I could,Mine makes the electronic farting noise at least once during every movie I watch and after it's turned off.It is annoying and embarassing while having any friends over.I can't believe anyone would rate this speaker higher than one because most of the time it works.This isn't rocket science. A speaker should not ruin any movies by making loud random noises.Avoid it like the plague.
1,Stay Away,"I too was interested in a cheap sub, and this seemed to fit the bill. I read about the farting noise when it went into sleep mode, and figured I could live with it. Well, maybe, but that's not the only issue I had.The amp has two switch positions: ""off"" and ""auto"". It does not have an ""always on"" position, and this is a critical failure. At certain volumes, the auto-sensing ""feature"" will put the sub into power-save mode mid-song, overlaying the fart noise on top of the music. At this point, there's no bass, until the volume gets turned up, it senses the signal again, and it kicks back on.In songs with quiet periods, or movies where explosions alternate with dialog, the sub turned itself on and off way too often - it was completely intolerable. I could hear a bass line, then it would be gone, replaced with the fart noise.If you're cranking repetative industrial or techno, you won't have this problem, but users with other applications in mind should pony up an extra $23 for a better sub."
2,Move up to buy a JBL instead.,"Well, this subwoofer looks ok, but check the reviews. Compared to this, you can buy a great 10-inch JBL w/ digital amp, and not really leave the same price arena."
5,I once looked at one in a store,"Since the reviewer J-D ""Audiophile"" thought he would leave bad feedback based on his/her own stupidity and an experience with another retailer than amazon... Here is my review based on the fact that I once saw this product in a store.It was a black, square box. When the sales dude turned it on, it actually went boom-boom. It was transcendent. Buy this."
2,Sounds okay when it works.,"I purchased a factory-recoditioned JPS12 from an amazon store about a month ago. It arrived quick enough, the box was in good condition.I didn't have a chance to fully test it out until the 20 day, and around that day I realized it was damaged. When the subwoofer was plugged in, but no audio signal was sent - it burped every 5 minutes or so. Contacted the store I bought it from (J&R;) said they couldn't refund my money because it was past their 12 return day period. Called Jensen support, and they verified the item was damaged!!! AAARRGGGHHH.Will never buy recondition Jensen again."
3,Cute movie,"I only bought it because IMDB wrote James Roday (my favorite person on the planet) is playing in it, but after I watched the movie I found out he's not in it. Still - it's a cute movie and I liked it."
3,"Nice pics, Poor Subject Index","The heading says it all.. Quality book, some-what amateurishly written, contains scholarly material, but one cannot look-up but a few subjects by name, ie; Manna''. However does a fair job with places and names and has seperate directories for them. The 'Oxford Companion to the Bible' is a better work- no pics or glossy pages, just solid info."
4,"Very informative but, it still seems to be not really complete. I can not pinpoint what it is but my sense tells me that it coul","Very informative but, it still seems to be not complete. I can not pinpoint what it is but I believe it could still be improved."
3,Disappointed,I thought that this would be about daily living but it is mostly about the politics through the different eras.
5,Tasteful Acoustic Jazz,"6 tracks: Another Waltz; The Glass Man; Angles; Castellane; Moscow; Gravity...Interesting, well played original acoustic jazz ranging from relatively straight-ahead ballads to more probing explorations. Half the tracks feature Peter Erskine and Eddie Gomez as the rhythm section."
1,product quality,Video has a wide blurry line across the top causing the whole picture to vibrate and become unwatchable.
2,New Phone,The unit is functional and worth the price. Unfortunately the owner's manual could be organized a little better. It could also be written more clearly.
4,Man who fell in love,"The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon - met my expectations, good writing. Book arrived when expected in good shape"
1,Juvenile and annoying,"This book is terribly disappointing. Gay and Native American characters does not automatically make this (or any) book mystical or spiritual. Quite the opposite, this book is brutally carnal. Every chapter tries to be more shocking and outrageous than the one before. By the end of the book, I was rolling my eyes and not even caring what ridiculousness was coming next. Save your time and your money and read something else. Or if you must, buy it used."
3,Just trying to keep my head above water,"At the moment I'm beginning book four of Moon and I have the distinct feeling of just trying to hold on for the ride. Never before have I read anyting quite like this. The book seems to be heading in a definite direction but pushing through it has become a leap of faith, in that I keep hoping for a more in-depth understanding of what I've read so far. I'm afraid the novel is failing to move me the way I hoped it would...taking into consideration the time setting and Shed's situation only serves to explain to a point the events that take place along the way. Despite the fact that Hollywood has had an effect on our view of the Old West, I've found myself wondering how accurate this book really is, if that was the author's intent. I won't give up before I finish, but the more I read,the less I feel like I'm gaining from this novel."
2,Lunatics,"The first two-thirds of this story is very good, with wild but endearing characters and an interesting plot. But then, it seems as though the author dumps all the tragedy and suffering he can possibly think of on the characters, like he is setting up bowling pins just to knock them down. The very end of the book is plain awful, with plot resolutions that are, in turn, nauseating, cutesy, and just plain preposterous, despite the fact that this is a semi-magical realism type of tale. Skip this and read In the City of Shy Hunters. This one is a real mess."
5,Announcement of PhD work on Tom Spanbauer,"I am an Irish student and I begin a PhD in Comparative Literature in Princeton University NJ this year. The beauty and breadth of The Man Who Fell in Love with the Moon have left me reeling ever since I read it, and, since I will be writing on it over the course of my PhD. I need to find other texts which readers feel are similar or interesting to compare"
2,Buggy bust,"It was my bad to think that for the price this kit would include more, but it was essentially a million of pieces but did not even include an engine, it was disspointing but not as much as trying to receive my refund, I returned it 3 months ago and I have yet to receive a penny"
5,My favorite CD.,"This is one of my favorite CD's. If you haven't heard of the Honeyrods yet, don't worry, you will, these guys are awsome!"
4,Good possibilities...,"I won this CD on a radio contest...At first I was like ""Who the heck are the Honeyrods"", but I really liked the whole CD upon listening to it. They got great potential..."
5,Brilliant album by Patitucci,"I bought this album by chance, having never heard of John Patitucci before. The presence of Dave Weckl on drums and the curious cover design (would make a great poster) drove me to buy this on impulse. I wasn't disappointed - the bass playing is superb and made very interesting by the appearance of Armand Sabal-Lecco who was born in Cameroon and co-wrote the cover song for this album (which incidently was Grammy nominated). The music has a distinct Afro-Funk style to it and there isn't a single track that doesn't sound great - each track is different and surprising making this one of the best pieces of music in my collection that I listen to very often and never tire of. Highly recommended."
4,Eclectic and Sonorous. Classic Patitucci.,"I recently bought this album speculatively, and on the strength of J.P's earlier offerings, which have always been, at the very least, interesting. Sufficed to say, this album played in my car , daily, for all of two weeks.It's an eclectic mix of world-music inspired offerings, varying in tempo and flavour, injected with that distinctive energy, that, to my mind, sets the Patitucci/Weckl combination in a class of it's own. But, for me, the the thing that really clinches it, is that tone that J.P draws from his instrument. Whether he's in the engine room, driving a groove, or nestling atop a gentle melody his tone and touch stand out delectably.Definately one for the collection."
3,"great photos, geography passable, other info weaker","While this book is certainly an eye catcher it falls short of an exhaustive reference book. Perhaps it's a good introduction for the beginner, but I was hoping it would do for Whiskey what Clive Coates'The Wines of Bordeaux: Vintages and Tasting Notes 1952-2003did for Bordeaux. Specific information with regard to process, grain choice, barrel selection and aging at each distillery was spotty. In some cases there was no discussion of various products from a producer. I am sure meaningful tasting notes for whiskey can be tricky, but I didn't find these particularly useful either. From time to time i noticed an insightful tasting comment and frequently obvious dominating characteristics were noted but many of the tasting notes seemed rather generic. While preference is particularly subjective I think more critical evaluation would be helpful in terms of conveying tasting information."
4,Very detailed,"This book goes into great detail regarding everything you would ever want to know about whiskey. The only downside is the information is a little technical and goes very deep, so if your looking for more of a high level overview, this book may be a bit much."
4,Whiskey: the definitive world guide by Michael Jackson,This is a beautifully executed books with lots of information and stunning pictures. It makes a wonderful gift itemif you are looking for a coffee table book who your favorite sipper.
2,whiskey,this book was absolutly horrible at helping me save money on my car insurance did love the colorful pictures though
4,"Great book, bad shipping",The book is great...very informative. Unfortunately my NEW copy arrived looking like and old beaten up Library copy. What's going on Amazon?
4,Pretty Good Tunes,"I was 16 when I first heard this record. My friend taped me about 4 songs of his dad's original LP and we got in the car, he put it in. I was pretty much blown away. The Title song ""Strutting My Stuff"" Would have to be the album's best. Followed Closely by ""I Love This Life I Lead"". But Elvin Bishop seems more than just about funk music, he seems like the type of guy that would have burned out in the 70's if only anyone was paying attention. It is a shame this album didn't get enough attention because it is quite good. The most recognizable tune on the whole album is ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love""."
1,He made tofu high fat/calorie,I had high hopes for this cookbook after hearing hisinterview on NPR so I got one the next day. I was worriedwhen just glancing through I found a number of recipiesstarting with two sticks of butter; even Paula Deen onlycalls for one and she doesn't claim to be making healthyfood. I took it to work so that I could have a co-workerwho is a better cook than I am look at it and she pointedout that most of the recipies are high in fat and that hemanaged to make a Lemon and Garlic Tofu with 630 caloriesand 48g of fat per serving with 1/2 a stick of butter and1/4 a cup of olive oil. His Uptown Buscuits are 235 cal. &14g of fat per bisquit. With breakdowns like that; Ithink I'll have better luck just making it the old fashionedway and cutting down on the serving sizes.
5,Outstanding collaborative effort!,"What could be better than Chumbawamba remixed by Negativland? It's simply astounding! The tone, music, and ideas of Chumbawamba, mixed up with the technical expertise, insight, and humor of Negativland--two of the best bands around on one CD, and at the right price. You won't be dissappointed."
2,NOT TOO MUCH FUN,"I bought this for my son when he was almost 2. He never really looks to play with it even though he loves to stack blocks etc. I thought this might me a nice change from regular legos, but he doesnt like them. He throws them and I frankly dont find too much fun with them. I am sorry I purchansed them. I should have saved the money."
3,Very itchy/scratchy!,My daughter got this for her 4th birthday and it fit her well....however there is no lining and the mesh-type material is very rough and scratchy. My daughter could not wear it for more than a minute without crying for me to help her get out of it. Hopefully we can add a soft liner so make it bearable.
2,"nice price but the shutdown ""farting"" is unacceptable","This just arrived today. Unfortunately I bought this subwoofer without doing enough research on whether or not the ""farting"" sound (when it enters standby mode) is a real problem. I'm using the subwoofer in my surround sound TV setup, and for me, I'm getting it about every 20 minutes. This during constant TV watching, when you would think it would be getting a signal and wouldn't go into standby mode. It irritates the heck out of me. Now I have to decide whether or not to send it back (and pay the shipping myself)."
5,Very helpful for hypnotherapist,"I highly recommend this book by Roy Hunger who has acknowledged his gratitude to his teacher Charles Tibbets who was truly a giant in his field. It has been helpful in my work at Pendleton Memorial Methodist Hospital, New Orleans, LA. Chaplain Paul G. Durbin, Ph.D."
2,A therapy book...poorly written,"You need to have read the first book...""the art of hypnosis"" to benefit from this book. It is based purely on the therapy side, and assumes you have read the previous book with constant back references.However, I did not go back in hindsight and buy the first book because the style of writing had put me off. Far too many referrals to the authors mentor, and lack of detail on the areas of importance.I would put this book at the bottom of the pile of books I have read on the subject....There are so many better ones out there!"
4,A Sound Tale,"This was an interesting tale, and kept me occupied for its total length. During the course of the book, it came to pass that the author was keen on embellishment where he saw fit, and I began to wonder how much of the book was embellishment and how much was actually real. He mentions hardly anything of his day-to-day life outside of his quest, which would have been nice to hear about. There is no mention of where his money to live came from during all these years after he left his wife and kids; nor who footed the bill for his air and land travel. Was he privy to a trust fund, or did his wife give him a stipend? He doesn't mention anywhere getting paid to do his ""research."" The book would have been more balanced had he included more of his ""real"" life, as it seems like everything after he left his family was golden."
5,Practical Uses of the Ancient Method of Candlesticks,"Stephen Bigalow is a master at showing how the ancient method of candlestick charting can be applied to all of today's markets -- not just stocks, but options, futures and indexes. His explanations are clear, concise and use many examples and charts. His practical approach to investing using candlesticks as he has refined them guide the reader from an introduction to full comprehension of the methodology. Every trader and investor should have this insight in his knowledge base to draw upon in everyday use."
2,"Book OK, Took 1 month to deliver (lost in mail)","The book is in the condition described (very good), but took a month to be delivered. I don't know what went wrong, but the USPS ""lost mail"" service had to re-route it to our address (in a different envelope)."
5,Excellent resource from neuro psych grad education to med school,"I used this book in my psychopharmacology course in grad school and it gave me an excellent insight into the pharmacokinetic aspects of psychotropic drugs. I have found that, even after starting medical school, this is a book that I use over traditional pharmacology texts for drugs related to psychiatric disorders, those used for epilepsy, and opioid drugs.The book begins with an introduction to neurotransmitters and their common functions in the CNS. There are separate chapters for each class of psychotropic drug: antipsychotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, opioids, ETOH, cannabinoids, dissociative anesthetics, and others that I am sure I am forgetting. Each chapter includes the history of the drug, mechanisms of action, pharmacokineitics and pharmacodynamics."
2,Note: Heat NOT included!,"I bought this ""Digital"" heating pad about a year ago and right of the bat I experienced a problem. It seemed to work right the first time and I would have loved it if it kept on working. But it didn't. Instead it began to count time and not heat up. Occasionally it would heat up if I unplugged it and plugged it back in.So I decided to get a replacement for it. The store sent me a new one and It seemed to work OK once more. hen a similar or same issue with the heat occurred. But I got it working and after some time in the closet(for the most part one does not use these things frequently) and at last I took it out again to use. Well, here we go again and it seem I have a $60 timer, but with ""Heat NOT Included""."
2,"This film had the potential to be great, but everything fell below all that I expected","Here we have a Yash Raj film. The ever gorgeous Tanisha Mukerjee, and a time span of less than two hours, but yet this film was just plain stupid!Tanisha Mukerjee is gorgeous. I'd almost tolerate any Bollywood film that would have her, and I put alot of confidence in Yash Raj to put out a great film, but I was really let down with this film.I appreciate that it wasn't some long, tiring, three hour movie but even at just under two hours, there still was way too much music which usually kills the appeal of any Bollywood film to most Americans (including American born Indians).I won't watch this one again anytime soon."
4,Nostalgia and Wisdom,"Hunting with the Bow and Arrow by Saxton PopeNostalgia. Pope was one of the people who befriended Ishi, the lost Native American Indian. They shot together and hunted together with many a wise word from Ishi. Pope starts his hunting in a different world as we see it today. Penned in 1922 there is no finesse in the hunting stories. His adventures are interesting and his methods are strengthened with Ishi's wisdom and experience. Pope and his friend Young were the instigators of the trophy hunt with sometimes distance being no object. Entertaining and interesting."
1,Idiots edition,"Classic of archery, must-read if you are interested in the sport. But don't buy this edition - the idiots can't even be bothered to get the title right. Just another shmuck who has figured out how to make money by reprinting out-of copyright works, badly."
3,Hunting with the bow and arrow,Good reading on the beginnings of traditional archery in the 20th century US. Nice hunting stories.
3,an okay book,"This book is good for those who want to learn the basic EFI system. Some thoery, and some parts interesting. It was more oriented towards beginners."
4,A Great Mystery.....with a great bookstore setting!,After just picking up the book and starting to read (not knowing about the series) I was quite suprised. The story was almost like a Nancy Drew mystery in a way. The characters each had their own little quirks and were likeable in their own ways. I fell in love with Death on Demand Bookstore (something I would love to have being a seller myself). This isn't a series for the serious mystery reader (like the ones with quite a bit of blood and bodies laying everywhere with cops or detectives). It's a light mystery that can pass a summer day away. I can't wait to work on the rest of the series.
2,"Well, every author has a miss sometimes...","Although I generally greatly enjoy Hart's books, I was disappointed in this one. If fact, I put it down to read something else and almost forgot to return to it. The story was mildly interesting, however, there were several different ""mini-plots"" that detracted from the whole. The story never got moving and there was no sense of suspense. To be honest, I was irritated by the ending, not satisfied as I usually am. And PLEASE, get rid of Laurel! She has to be the most obnoxious character I've ever read about. A little (very little!) of Laurel goes a long way. Also, Max has turned into a mindless playboy who reminds me of a big St. Bernard with Annie as his trainer. The earlier Death on Demand mysteries were far superior. I am hoping to have more like those to read soon. And no, adding a pregnancy will not help this series."
2,My first experience w/this author - and probably my last.,"I am a fan of the mystery books - and enjoy everything from Murder on the Orient Express to N is for Noose.However, the constant references to other stories, detectives, and characters in Yankee Doodle Dead, was enough to make me put the book down - several times.I hate leaving a book unread once I've begun - so I just finished it - but doubt seriously I will read any more of Hart's works.I think this is a boring read, and although other of her books might be riveting, this one certainly wasn't."
1,Wish I could give it a zero.,"Unlike the reviewer for Publisher's Weekly, I did not find the character of Annie Darling to be ""polite, considerate, cheerful"" or appealing in any way. Her actions towards others and her considerable mean-spirited and negative thoughts towards others made her a very unattractive personality. Annie's mother-in-law, made out to be dim-witted and boozy, was constantly being derided, yet she never did a single mean or hurtful thing to either Annie or Max. The murder was boring and the path to the ""whodunit"" made no sense at all. Read something else by someone else."
2,Please send Annie's mother-in-law on a very long vacation.,"I enjoy Carolyn Hart's mysteries, but Laurel is getting very annoying and boring. I enjoy the references to other mystery writers and the rest of her characters are usually well-written. One other minor complaint, please stop the cutesy pie allusions to Annie and her hubby when they're about to ""get intimate."" Puhleeze, it's just too juvenile for words."
2,Very Disappointing,"The depiction of the general was so ridiculous that I skipped almost everything he had to say. I've met my share of general and senior officers and haven't ever found one who is so absolutely chauvinistic, shallow, and unprofessional. I wanted to kill the SOB about ten pages in. It took me two tries to actually read the book. I was disappointed in many ways with this book. The multitudnous synonyms for ""to go"" and ""to walk"" are indicative of the predictable sentence structure. To give Hart credit,it did take me a while to figure out who the murderer was. However, this was definitely a low point in the series. Maybe it's time to wrap this one up if the plots and writing are as predictably boring and excruciating as in this volume."
2,"Humorous who-done-it, but too cutesy","I've read a few Henry-O books and enjoyed Dead Man's Island. I've read only one other Death on Demand series and thought I'd try this one. However, I felt that it drags along, especially when Annie refers to other mystery writers....I skipped a lot of that. Also, I got vey bored at the continual descriptions of the South Carolina heat and humidity. I did have fun counting all the verbs the author used for ""walked"": darted, sped, skipped, slid, raced, rushed,loped,jolted, etc., etc.. There must be a list somewhere. Granted, the author does write ""sweet"" stories, but I'm afraid this one is over the top. Not enough suspense. I finally didn't care who the murderer was."
1,Do NOT buy this night llight,"My son LOVES The Backyardigans and his room is decorated in them and when I saw this night light, I just had to have it for his room. Super cute right? The first one shorted out. So I thought it was a fluke and bought another. The second one just stopped working altogether. And we're not talking after long use. We're talking after a couple of nights. Something is wrong with this certain product and I wouldn't recommend it. If I could have chosen 0 out of 5 stars I would have."
5,Child of the Moon,"Child of the Moon is a wonderful story for families with young children. The author not only provides the readers with a wonderful story, she also includes her angelic voice on a CD in the form of a lullaby that goes along with the story. This book is great to read by itself or follow along with the music. Child of the Moon is an excellent tool for bonding time between parents and children at bedtime. It is not only a creative colorful imaginative story; it is also a magnificent way to inspiring young children to become interested in literacy and music. I really hope the author, Jeanne Cotter, and the illustrator, Chrysa Otto, will team up again to create another amazing children's book."
3,Good quality cap,Real nice quality but the sizing is screwed up big time. Have to return. Hope to get one that fits by sizing up. Don't think measuring helps - it didn't for me.
5,great hair product!!,"very good at taking away the frizz and leaving hair super soft, shiny... love this product"
4,good pendant,"this is a pretty pendant, but the picture is misleading, I was expecting a full-3d pendant, but it is only pretty from the front, the backside is hollow silver"
1,absolute trash,Haier's products are absolute trash.My product could not last more than 6 months.Its replacement lasted 4 months.I had numerous problems with improper cooling and the like.The product arrived in defective condition to begin with. It took 3 separate service calls to get the fridge in working order after being shipped in a supposedly NEW condition!
5,my search has ended,"i've been looking for this artist and album/cd forever. i 've called radio stations, searched the web, and couldn't find out who did ""thats your secret"". i use to hear it on XRT 93.1 fm in chicago in the 70's but lost track of it. i'd ask people if they knew of it and only got blank stares. then driving through St Louis KSHE 95fm last month i heard ""thats your secret"" and was floored by its sound still, but alas i lost the signal before they said who it was. it made my day today to finally find this gem. its ordered and i can't wait for it's arrival"
3,Almost what I needed,"These clear vinyl sleeves were almost exactly what I needed for my application. However, when I opened the box I learned that they had ""Memorex"" painted/stamped on the bottom right corner. There was no way to learn that in advance from the images available. I had to work pretty hard to remove the logos without damaging the sleeve. I wasn't always successful."
3,CD/DVD Keepers,I found Memorex who manufactures the product was out of the amount that I wanted. In fact they were on back order on the clear keepers. Amazon.com has come through.
5,very rare and very buetifull :),ive been searching for it for 5 years and trust me its by far the best soundtrack ever not to mention best game toobuy the soundtrack before you regret it for the rest of your life :)
2,Well...that was something else.,"We've all had our VHS bargain-bin experiences, but if I were not blessed with an appreciation for the bizarre and absurd I'd have tracked the vendor down and made them sit through it. It would have been far worse punishment than a refund of 5 bucks, I assure you.Indeed, the best reason to own this is to show it to other hentais, to see them gape in disbelief, struck dumb to decided if they'd just been ripped off by a delirious hack or mocked by a burned out malcontent...and don't even try to figure out if the writers were actually religious.I've no idea if an original language viewing would make this somehow 'better', as the utterly, and typically, awful English cast added to its stupefying effect."
1,Don't Bother,"To be honest, this series made my head hurt. Too many conflicting flashbacks, some unecessary nudity and slow moving episodes. I was glad to just get through it. The names weren't properly pronounced and the dubbing was monotone and horrible. This was definitely not my type of anime. There is a bit of shoujo-ai/yuri content in this anime as well for the shoujo fans who would like to take the risk. It was a good idea but that's all it really amounted to. Don't waste your money. There are better series out there worth spending money on."
2,Coulda been a lot better...,"The only people that cared about this movie were the artists. The voices sucked, lacked talent, and at times sounded like they were mocking the script.The story had potential... the actors and actresses just ripped it apart though. Try re-recording it with.... some talent, some emotion, and try to realize that even though yer staring in a cartoon... grown folks will be watching it, not little kids... unless people let their kids watch this stuff."
1,"Unusually and exceedingly peculiar, and altogether quite impossible to describe...","O.K., so there's a woman warrior, who led a crusade of other women warriors, and women took over the world (as if they haven't already, ba-dump-bump). And then there's a time-traveling demon, a convenient ""time tunnel"" built into an ancient monastery, a transsexual/lesbian love affair in there somewhere, and...you know what? Forget it. No, really, forget it; forget that this movie ever existed and move on to more comprehensible fare, like ""Urotsukidoji"". My rating: 1/10."
2,"Um, what can i say about this","Um, I think of this and say, ""What the hell was that""This was a story unlike anything i have seen. and quite frankly i never want to see it again. I got the dub version, and the voices stunk. then the script was horrible too. that didnt make a very good movie."
4,Insightful first half...,"The book gets 4 stars for me because of the value of the insight in the first few chapters of the book. Rognlien goes through Jesus' command to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strenght - linking each one to their value in worship.The first three chapters are the most signficant. It is here he lays the groundwork theologically for the rest of his book. However, as the chapters go by the book gets weaker as it becomes a manual of ideas that worked for his church. I tend to shy away from this type of approach in books, so the latter half didn't contain as much value as the first half of the book.Overall a worthwhile read, even if only for the first few chapters as it gets you to think in a way you haven't before."
3,Pretty good. But needs improvement.,"The pimsleur teaching method is good, though I feel many words could have used more detailed pronunciation instruction.Unfortunately the sound quality is rather poor. The background ""hissing static"" sound on the cassettes makes learning all the more difficult. I don't appreciate having to study with my ear literally up against the speaker, to hear properly what's being said.The same applies for the hebrew course."
1,Shipped the Wrong Thing,"I was shipped the wrong thing! I received a ""Gemini Wall Mount Jack""with no packing slip. I have sent two emails to Polsteins Home & Beyond and have yet to receive a reply."
5,"Product is great, shipping is not","I love Tom Baker DVDs. I know that this set is great, because I already own it. I ordered this set for my grandson, and sprang for $7.95 shipping so I could have it in 2 days. Not only did I never receive the item, but it took Lasership a full week do notify Amazon that they do not ship to my zip code. This was to be a Christmas gift and fortunately, I found a copy locally.In short, DO buy Tom Baker DVDs. Do NOT waste your money and faith on faster shipping. Had I gone with standard shipping, I'd probably have had the item in a shorter time than it took to be told that the item wasn't deliverable.Amazon, of course, gave me a full refund without quibbling. That's not the point. This was an annoying incident."
5,Best Doctor,Doctor who is always a classic no matter which episode you watch. This one is great in its own because it shows the start of the Dalek race. Imagine all the other episodes that would never have occurred or inside the DrWho universe - all the experiences and death avoided should this Doctor ended the Daleks before they even started...
4,Daleks,It was good to see the older Dr. Who series. They move at a much slower pace than current dr. Who's but it is interesting to see the history of the show.
5,BEST EPISODE EVER!,"Tom Baker shines as Dr. Who and Michael Wisher as Davros is just plain EVIL! In this episode, the Doctor must go back in time to slow down the Daleks or destroy them."
1,Highway Robbery,"Why are we obliged to buy two in one? Most of us have read the first book many years ago and have been waiting for a sequel. Well we finally get it and must have the first one with it and in hard cover to boot! Highway robbery to all fans of Sharon Green. Why not have a paperback of book two and be reasonable to all her fans?! Until then, I will not buy this outrageous price of a hard cover book. Give us a break!"
3,Who coul afford this book?,I rate this book 3 stars because I did like the book Sharon green has written 10 years ago (The Silver Bracers). But I won't pay this price for the hardcover. I'm ready to wait ten more year for the mass paperback.
3,quick read,"the first book was alright, but I was sorta mad that they didn't finish it then and tere. It sort of wanderend a bit but overall it is a good book, especially if you're in the mood for a different kind of soap novel."
3,Makes great coffee while it lasts,"I agree with the majority of reviews that this unit makes great coffee. It grinds the beans fresh, and the aroma of the coffee is wonderful. You do have to wash the inner parts after each use, but the real negative is that this unit does not last long. I am on my fourth one, and none has lasted longer than 2 years. The warranty is 3 years, so you can purchase one, replace it under warranty, and get 4 years of total service."
2,Some sort of meatiness,"Good writing, but I found it hard to stomach the male slave element (Beefy, dim-witted, beautiful, well-endowed and submissive men serving wise women) and the contrast between the advanced Goddess-lead society and the primitive society of raping savages that follow male gods? Simplistic and bizarre, too bad."
4,A classic,"Classic Skinny Puppy and a show the likes of which we will probably not see again.Have VHS copy but no more player so had to settle for this. I would really prefer physical copy or DRM free but it serves my nostalgic purposes despite being limited to playing on my PC. Read the compatible devices before purchasing. Still, happy I got it.Only four stars because of DRM"
5,Very enjoyable,"I greatly enjoyed this latest book by Jack Neely regarding tales of Knoxville's past, which can be described at times as having a civic multiple-personality disorder. Many of the stories were particularly appealing as they complemented stories about various places and people told to me by my mother and grandmother. Mr. Neely is able to take legends or old newspaper stories and research them to give added dimension and information. He shows that Knoxville can be a very interesting place, if often frustrating, when one decides to just enjoy people as they are (or were)."
5,Fascinating History,"The narrative is fascinating reading, both in terms of the history revealed in the words of Mary Jemison and in terms of James Seaver who gives us his own version of her story. The effect is a layering of historical periods. With the help of the editing, you can peer through and see not only the period of Mary Jemison's captivity, but also the prejudices of the following time. An interesting example of the simultaneous respect and loathing with which the early settlers viewed the native inhabitants. I first read the narrative in high school, and would recommend it for young and old readers alike."
5,great bulbs,Can't find them in any local store so I have to order online. Last a long time but I nedd to keep a few extra on hand in case one goes out.
4,Great story at the time it was written,"I have to say, it was great when it first came out, but now it's been ruined by DS9's own version of this mirror universe. In Duane's novel, the Romulans were wiped out, and the Klingons were still alive but conquered by the Empire. On DS9, the Klingons and Cardassians are somewhat allies.This book was great, but it seems to be that if you have die hard fans reading the novels, why can't the television episodes relating to the same subject be alike? The way I see it, Diane Duane first thought of a sequel to the ""Mirror, Mirror"" episode on the original series."
3,"Slow, But overall entertaining","This was a nice book, but it could have been better. It does not match at all with the events in DS9, or the William Shatner novels. It was of course, released before those stories existed, but that dosen't make up for some other not-so-good chapters. The ""dolphin"" ambassador Hwii is just a page-filler! And the actions of the ""real"" crew just slow down the pace of the novel. There were some parts I did enjoy however. For example, when Picard is listening to his conter-part's actions as captain of the Enterprise, they mirror all of the episodes, but in a negative light. If you're not one for patience, skip to about chapter 6. The preceding chapters are just ""Oh, what's happened?"", and ""What do you think we should do Data?"". 6 is definetley where the action starts."
2,A Boring Book,"The premise is interesting, but the result is a boring book filled with unnecessary dialogues, ambiguous descriptions, and inaccurate scientific basis. If you're a die-hard Trekkie, you would probably read it anyway, but afterwards you would be writing a review just like this one"
3,"Ok, but not good as abridged (Audio Version)","I would have really enjoyed the story, but too many details had to be left out to fit it in 3 hours of audio (I hope that's why it was hard to follow).Enjoyed the characters."
1,Why would someone every want to publish this book?,"This was the WORST!!! What's up with the talking Dolphin? I found thid book to be dull, drawn out, and just horrible. This could have been a great story, but it wasn't. Talk about STUPID!!"
1,Huh?,I once attempted to read this book. I got about fifty pages into the book before the talking dolphin got me so confused that I could not finish it.
1,the worst book that i have ever read,"this book tries to continue the legacy set in the original star trek episode, ""mirror, mirror"", but insteads disgraces it with unrealistic characterization & a wild and stupid plot; it contradicts the time that it was set in with the 'the next generation' series timeline and I am glad that the producers and writers on ds9 decided to ignore this book in their vision of the mirror, mirror universe. bottom line: the worst book that I have ever read. of course, that's just my opinion, i could be wrong. -AzraeL"
4,"Great story, weak ending","This is a wonderful story--the author really knows the characters and stays true to their personalities. Also the story is solid, and unfolds in a steady pace. But the end doesn't seem satisfying--the outcome almost seems too easy, and the pacing doesn't feel right (things happen too quickly as we get close to the end, and cause the outcome to be almost unbelievable).I can't say more because I don't want to give away any of the story to those of you who still care to read it. It truly is a great read. Just be prepared for a slightly disappointing ending."
3,This book was printed at a bad time.,"Diane Duane had a decent idea, but the biggest problem with this book is that it was written before Crossover on DS9, but it was published afterward. What this did was to competely destroy the plasability of this book. I wouldn't read this book unless you are willing to overlook the fact that there is very little here that has to do with the Star Trek universe."
3,Fair reflection,"Dark Mirror concludes the story of the mirror universe, introduced in the Original Series episode ""Mirror, Mirror"", and later concluded by five episodes in Deep Space Nine. Since this book was published before the first mirror universe episode on Deep Space Nine (""Crossover""), it doesn't fully co-incided with the episodes on DS9. With that said, the story itself is good, but very slow moving, especially in the beginning."
4,Mirror TNG,"Diane Duane's first foray into writing Next Generation was the script for a memorable early episode called ""Where None Have Gone Before."" This is her first TNG novel. As the title suggests, this is a sequel to the fan-favorite TOS episode ""Mirror, Mirror."" The writing of this novel predates Deep Space Nine's own canonical sequelization(s) of ""Mirror, Mirror,"" the first of which was quite good -- but this is better. Duane's broader canvas lets her explore levels of opposition between our familiar characters and their counterparts... Mirror-Troi, for example, is the political officer of her Enterprise, is the most feared officer on the ship... Not someone you want ""empathizing"" with you... Worth the price of admission is one brilliant scene where Picard discovers the differences between the works of our Shakespeare, and his Mirror-Counterpart's... Great stuff!"
4,Intense action story,"This is an excellent, well-written story of trying to get home from an alternate universe. I espically appriciated the attention to technical detail and keeping in line with the show, and with the ST:TNG technical manual. This author has obviously researched extensivly before writing this book.We watch..(read about)...Captain Picard, Councelor Troi, and Commander LaFordge as they switch places with thier counterparts, and must avoid dectection or face horrible consequences. We travel with them as they contemplate the true horror of the possibility that they could have turned out so different, yet still be so similar in this alternate universe. A truly riviting story right to the end."
5,"Brief Discussion on Diana Duane's ""Dark Mirror""-StarTrek TNG","to the reader, Allow me to confirm your intentions on buying this book, it is spectacular! Rememeber the episode ""Mirror, Mirror"" in the original series where Kirk and crew became exposed to a dark and evil parallel dimension, well bring these memories into the 24th century! Imagine Picard with the wrath and anger of Khan, A power hungry and murderous Riker and a seductive Troi who has the power to probe your thoughts and use them to your destruction. All this with the possibility of Galaxy Class Battle ready Enterprise-D coming into our reality and taking over the Federation. It's all the same action of ""Mirror, Mirror""-TOS, with the suspence of ""Crossover""-DS9. -CarL Jackson"
3,Dar Mirror BRIEF review,"Diane Duane is an intelligent author. She knows her Star Trek. But she is to serious about it. She tends to be too wordy. ""Dark Mirror"" starts off really slow, but picks up by the middle/end. The last couple of chapters are too ""techno-bablish"". I prefer an auther like Michael Jan Friedman or Peter David who knows all about Star Trek but have a sense of humor about it. The highlight of this book is the BAD Troi. Also, the GOOD Picard is very good too. Hwiii the dolphine is LAME. I would not get it unless you have read all the other books you wanted to read. So in summary, this book is a ""5"". Not bad, not good. It shouldn't be a priority. I say, read ""Q-Squared"". It is completely an opposite style of ""Dark Mirror"". Oh, lastly, the DS9 shows have changed the ""history"" of this. They say the ""empire"" was tooken over, it still exsists in this book"
3,Not one of my favorites,"I guess it kind of hurt to read this book after seeing the DS9 episode Crossover, which completely contradicts it. Duane clearly went against the principle of the ""Mirror, Mirror"" episode by having Spock fail. An empire based on evil was illogical so it seemed right for Spock to bring it down. In addition, I really wasn't captivated by the ""alternate"" crew on the Enterprise the way I was with the episodes dealing with the alternate universe. Finally, I just couldn't follow the Dolphin's dialogue and the scientific theory concerning what was going on. I don't recommend this book."
4,"Did you like Mirror, Mirror?","If you did then you will like this story of the Enterprise crew meeting up with themselves. Picard and others battle to get away from the meaner Enterprise. By doing so they are freed from their bondage. This book, is easy to understand and funny in many places. Watch out for Deana, she bits!"
3,started off promising...,"I got this book hoping it would bring back Buffy and Angel memories. It started off good, the gangs fighting monsters and all, and then when Buffy and crew went to Los Angeles I was expecting some crossover magic. Spike was very out of character, I didnt care for him. There where some goofs too, like when did Buffy ever meet Gunn? It was merely ok, and at the end it got boring. To much fighting. It took me three weeks to finish this book. I don't recommend. It does have some good character insights though, so if you see it you might as well read it. Its Buffy and Angel after all."
1,simply awful,Just terrible. Would cut out every 10 to 15 seconds. Horrible static. Save money and get fisher price.
1,Do not buy,"I agree with every negative review out there on this product. It is absolutely ridiculous how obnoxious this monitor is! We finally started using it when we moved the baby to his own room at 7.5 weeks--two days later my husband said either I get a new monitor or he's just going to chuck this one out the window! The baby didn't wake us up for hours, but the receivers woke us up at least two dozen times between feedings! The static and the constant clicking made me feel like we were listening to a CB on the highway! The good news is: I returned it to Babies r Us (even though I threw out the box the week before I returned it) and I bought the Sony 9 channel monitor. It stinks that it doesn't have to receivers, but there is NO STATIC! We are very pleased AND it was $10 cheaper! Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this product--buy the Sony instead!"
1,This Monitor is a NIGHTMARE!,"Just as the first reviewer on this page - this monitor is horrible! The batteries have NEVER gone out at any other time than 4:00am, there's simply no warning and the static is unbearable. We registered for this monitor because of the two separate monitors, which I thought would save us from having to change the batteries so often and give us a few options for leaving them in various rooms throughout the house. Really, this has been the MOST frustrating part of new motherhood! I highly suggest that you try a different monitor."
1,Too much Static - Can't hear the Baby!,"I was told that this was a top of the line monitor but after receiving it as a gift, I had to return it because of all the static. I could not hear my baby at all! I purchased the Sounds and Light Monitor instead ... and I'm very satisfied with the exchange."
2,BAD,"When it worked it worked well. The only problem is that it didn't work very often. This monitor is not worth the money. I constantly got static. When I moved, if I just left it still. It was very hard to use it at night as it would constantly make noise that would have nothing to do with the baby. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,Do not buy this product,"This baby monitor lasted about 1 week. After changing batteries, plugging units in, the static was so loud that it drowned out the sound of babies completely. Not sure if the unit was defective, but it was terrible. Do not buy this product."
1,Terrible to have to rely on,"This monitor worked great for about 2 weeks - then it kept going to constant statc. We can fix it for about 15 seconds by changing channels and then back again, but I have to keep running over to the receivers to do it. It basically is static all the time - and we leave it plugged in, since we originally thought the batteries were the problem. It is ATROCIOUS and is a major headache - which should NEVER be the case for something this important. I don't feel I can trust it at all and have to go buy another one."
3,Not as bad as some would make it sound,"I use this monitor every day. Occasionally I will pick up static or someone's radio transmission, but it's rare. The static does happen a lot if the batteries are running low."
3,It's JUST okay.,"I received this monitor as a gift. I was impressed that it could pick up the slightest sound from the nursery. After a day or two my husband changed the receiving mode and we could hear EVERYTHING the neighbors said in their home, two doors down! I wondered how much of they heard of us. Just as a word of warning, someone might be listening to you."
1,DO NOT BUY,My husband and I are soooo tried of this monitor!!! It's soo noisy all we hear are the neighbors on the phone or their babies. Because that's all it picks up not your baby in the next room!! Do not buy this unless you want to listen to your neighbors and not your children.. WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!
1,Worst product I can Buy,When I saw it in the box the specs semm realy nice and the 900 Mhz. made me buy it. It is almost imposible to use you need to move the monitor to get off the static.
1,Big mistake,"We registered for this monitor thinking that it would be a higher quality since it was one of the more expensive. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! One receiver makes a ""clicking"" sound every 5 seconds and the other one shrieks. I just wish I had kept the box to return it!"
1,The worst poduct!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't even think about purchasing this product. It functions better as a doorstop than a baby monitor. The static will drive you crazy! If anything moves in your house (including you) the monitor will give off tremendous static. Keep yourself sane, and save yourself a trip back to Babys-R-Us, DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!"
1,Read this review before you buy,We registered for this based on the dual receivers. LOTS OF STATIC. Picked up sounds just fine and the lights on top registered the levels but intermittent static and occassional clicking sounds were a real nuisance. I would look elsewhere
1,Very disappointed,"We received this as a gift, and we're returning it to the store today. Although we can hear our baby clearly, there is a very annoying clicking sound every 6 seconds. It's loud enough that it wakes us up several times during the night."
1,Don't waste your time (or money) with this one.......,"After having success with an older ""First Years"" monitor, we were in need of a new one. Without doing my homework I immediately went and bought this ""upgraded"" First Years model. What a mistake. We cannot use it anymore since all we hear is annoying ""flicking"" static on one channel, and the second channel picks up the noise in my neighbors house. I spoke to a company representative who suggested that I ask my neighbor to move her monitor further away from my home!! Otherwise, that I should go buy another monitor that is a higher or lower mghz. If this complaint is so common, the company should explore ways to correct. I couldn't be more dissatisfied."
1,"""Peace Of Mind"" Yea Right!!!","This monitor gave me more problems than any other baby item I own. I bought The first Years monitor because I thought I was getting a great product BOY WAS I WRONG!!!It's got nothing but static when it is plug into an outlet, no matter where I plugged it in. I found it works best when using batteries, and this could get expensive after a few months."
3,Have to try it to see if it works for you!,This monitor worked perfectly fine for me...except that it would produce loud static noise whenever the microwave was on or the telephone would ring. I found that simpler monitors without the 900 mhz technology worked just as well and didn't have the interference with other electronic equipment.
1,Horrible product,"I am a two time mom and have had this monitor for 18 months now with my first one. Horrible. Incredible static, everywhere in the house, does not go beyond 200 feet. Do not buy."
1,what a hunk of junk!!,"Don't even bother with this monitor! Never have I purchased a such a lousy baby item! If you can't hear the baby over the static, why have a monitor?? You'd have a better shot of having nothing and straining to hear the baby froim your room. I was awake soooo many nights because of the static and this incessant beeping noise!! Mom's know how hard it is waking up several times a night because of the baby, but waking up even more often because your baby monitor is beeping at you is ridiculous!!! I hope someone from First Years reads this and makes some serious changes!! In the mean time, buy the Sony 27-channel baby monitor. Sometimes it's hard to find (they can't seem to keep them on the shelves) but well worth it! I even went back and bought my sister one when she got pregnant. The best monitor out there!!"
1,If I would have only read this first!,"We have had this monitor for 3 months now and the static did get annoying at times but as long as you adjusted the receiver, it would stop. Then one morning at 4am the reciever started screaming and it never worked the same again! I tried changing the batteries and it continued to do the same thing. Nothing I tried worked. I am now looking for a new monitor and will let everyone I know NOT to buy this monitor!"
1,WORST BABY ITEM I EVER PURCHASED!!!,"The loud crackling static will drive you crazy!! Also, when the phone rings the monitor makes an EXTREMELY LOUD buzzing noise until you answer and then the conversation is transmitted over the monitor receiver like a speaker phone! This item is a worthless piece of garbage."
1,this monitor is horrible!,"I'm very disappointed in this monitor. The static is awful. Very sorry we got it. In fact, we're going out to buy a new one."
1,Big Mistake,My hubby opted for this one because of the dual receiver and the long range. As I said big mistake...unless you want to hear statics the whole day. It does pick up the softest sounds but the statics make it worthless.
1,Peace of Mind Monitor,The static from this monitor was constant. I do not recommend this product whatsoever. We received ours as a shower gift and I am hoping to be able to return it despite not having the receipt. I have learned through this process to carefully look at buyer's reviews before purchasing something!
1,'Lose Your Mind' monitors,"We got these monitors as a gift at our baby shower and I just bought the Fisher Price Sounds n Lights ones. The Peace of Mind ones should be called Lose Your Mind monitors. The static is so bad! And forget about using one outside, unless the are right next to the base unit, you can't hear anything!!! I wished I'd read these reviews before I put these on my registry!"
1,UGH! Hated this monitor,Dont waste your time on this one. Its terrible! It clicks and has all kind of static. I have tried several monitors and this one was the worst!
1,NOT PLEASED!,"This baby monitor drove me crazy because of the static or interference. It is hard to sleep with a new baby, but to get woken up or can't fall asleep because of constant Crrrr, Crrrr crrrrrrrrr... no way! I would really discourage anyone from buying this monitor unless they live in the middle of nowhere."
1,Terrible static. Returned it.,"The 'Peace of Mind' was a waste of time and money. Like others have mentioned, I liked the idea of the dual receivers that it offered. Unfortunately, the static was terrible, so as to make it unusable. We exchanged it for a Sony BabyCall which we are extremely happy with. It doesn't have dual monitors, but I suppose I could buy another set if it really became a necessity."
1,Don't waste your money,"We purchased this monitor, believing it would be a good one. It would be, if not for the frequent, loud clicking it makes. It's too noisy to even be able to sleep through. From reading other reviews (which I should have done before we bought ours) it seems a lot of other parents have had the same complaint. We ended up buying a Sony 900mhz monitor and it works absolutely great."
1,Too much interference,I have found that there is too much interference. The only time I really need the monitor is at night and there is so much popping and static that it is difficult to sleep with it on. I have it turned down so low that my husband cannot hear our son from his side of the bed and the interference still wakes us. I have been very unhappy with this product and will replace it as soon as possible.
2,The static will drive you NUTS!!!!,"I loved the fact that this monitor came with 2 receivers, but I wish that I had read these reviews before putting it on my registry. It picked up the sound of the baby very well, it also would pick up noises from our neighborhood and when our phone would ring the monitor would just go off by making loud, very obnoxious noises. We had to shut it off to get it to stop. The receiver had to be sitting just right to avoid tons of static, and that position wasn't always the same so we had to keep moving it. It would go nuts with static if we even walked by it, not even touching it! We had to replace it with a diffent brand. Very disappointed - Peace of Mind is a very inappropriate name for this monitor - it gave us a lot of headaches."
1,We should of read the reviews...,We brought our baby home from the hospital yesterday and hooked up the monitors - they worked great...for 24 hours. Now all we hear is static that only gives way to clicks and leaves us wondering which is more annoying. To make things worse they worked fine yesterday so in my rush to clean up the house and be a good husband I threw away the box so now it looks like [$] wasted. My wife has a hard enough time sleeping in between feedings without having to listen to static. Don't waste your money - buy another one.
1,Take it back before you even open it!,"This was the worst baby product we purchased. There is A LOT of interference. We found ourselves walking around trying to find a spot in the house where it didn't get any static. One night...we actually heard someone's phone call coming through on the monitor. For the most part, you don't even hear your baby...you hear static and noise. I can't believe they can even market an item like this which obviously has many problems. We took ours back. Do yourself a favor, if you get this as a gift...take it back before you even open it. It's junk! We bought a Sony 900Mhz and love it. There is no interference and it is like being in our son's room with him. It gives us much better peace of mind."
2,Terrible monitor,"The reception is crystal clear. However, every so often there is a very load static noise that comes and does not go away until you get up and shut the monitor off. Who wants to be wakened during the night by that terrible sound when you are up a couple of times during the night for feeds? I took it right back, tried the fisher price monitor with the music and light show and that was terrible, it had a constant clicking noise too. I finally ended up with the evenflow monitor and I am very happy with it. No static or clicking noise to be heard."
2,Too much static when moving,"I liked that this monitor came with two receivers, and both sound and lights. However, there was so much static that it was impossible to hear in the nursery. I found if I found a place where the sound was clear and then set the receiver down, it worked fine. However, if you moved it even slightly, the static was horrible. When I clipped it on and tried walking around, it was nothing but static. We are returning this monitor to try a new one."
1,awful product,My husband and I purchased this monitor yesterday and today it is going back to the store. There was a clicking noise every 15 seconds while the monitor was on and when we went to use our telephone the parent base would make an awfully loud static noise. I would not recommend this product at all.
2,lightwieght but useless,Makes my daughter crazy. She isn't even the one in that room. When traffic goes by it sounds like it is in our house. This machine is lightweight which I was looking forward to but I wish I would have read the reviews before adding it to my registry. ...
3,listening to others conversations!,"I bought this model before I read the reviews. The connection was crystal clear, NO static. However I kept getting my neighbors baby monitor on mine. I switched chanels, but it didn't help. I told my neighbors, they were suprised. I also heard another neighbors cordless phone call. It's very scary, I returned it ASAP. I am going to try more monitors, hopefully I won't hear my neighbors!"
1,Worst Monitor Ever,"If anyone gives you a set of these, or if you buy a set by accident - RUN back to the store and return them. Without a doubt this product is a complete disaster. The signal constantly gets lost causing a loud static noice to be produced. The only way to clear it is to turn it on and off. This product is a complete waste of hard earned money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER!!!!!!"
1,painfully irritating,this has got to be one of the worst monitors- One of the receivers picked up my child crying while the other remained silent. there is a ton of interference and it beeps nonstop.
1,The Worst!,"We liked our previous The First Years monitor, and when it stopped working we intended to get the same model, only to find that it had apparently been discontinued. We bought this one because it was the same manufacturer, and we liked the idea of having two receiver units. I wish we had checked here and read some reviews first. We have tried for months (don't ask me why we didn't return them) and have never been able to get clear reception. The unit picks up random cell phone conversations, radio broadcasts, interspersed with maddening static, electronic farts and squeals. Our old model had convenient built in rechargable batteries, but these units take 4 AA batteries each, making them fairly heavy, and they suck the power down very rapidly. Don't make the same mistake we did. Look elsewhere for a monitor."
1,Does not work properly,"My daughter is now 7 months old, and for the first 5 months we used this monitor because we didn't realize that it wasn't supposed to make all those noises. My parents bought another brand for their house and when we used it and it had no noise, we went out that day to get that one. This product crakles, makes fuzzy noises, and does not pick up little noises from the baby. I would not wast $50.00 on this product. It is one of the most expensive, but yet works horribly. You can spend a lot less and get a better product."
1,All it does it click....very dissatisfied,I just purchased this monitor for my daughter as our baby on the way will get the old one....so we thought. From the moment we turned this monitor on it kept clicking no matter where it was placed. We quickly decided that we needed to switch our daughter back to the Angel Care monitor so we could sleep in peace and know we would be able to hear her if she needed us!
5,Best monitor I own and I've tried them ALL,I received this monitor system for my shower 3 1/2 years ago and it's the only monitor that actually works. I now have another child and have bought 6 other systems trying to find something comparable with fail. I'm going back to this one. I still use my original one. ALL MONITOR SYSTEMS PICK UP CORDLESS PHONES AND OTHER MONITORS!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Don't Bother,"Pretty much cr-p. Sound reception is ok. But it keeps clicking every few seconds. And if you change the band (A to B), or shut off the baby-side monitor, all you get is static. Very annoying."
1,bk,This monitor system is a waste of money. It worked great for a few months and then one day we turned it on and all we heard was static. The static never goes away and it is completely useless. Needless to say we threw it away and had to buy a new system.
3,Good sound but also has a lot of static.,I've had this monitor for 3 months now and the sound is good as far as I can hear my son breathe through it BUT it has a lot of static and picks up phone conversations from others in our neighborhood.
1,Awful static and interferrence!!,"I should've read the reviews too!! The frist one went back b/c it kept making this awful loud noise and the second one is going back today b/c it makes a different noise. Every time our phone, or the neighbors phone, rings, it has loud static. Then it does it randomly in the middle of the night too!! Don't waste you money!!"
1,"All static, all the time","This monitor does not live up to its promises. It is horrible. I pick up sounds from other houses in my neighborhood and the constant static is unbearable! I thought that I was paying a bit more for quality - boy was I wrong. After 2 months with this product, I am going to buy something else!"
1,TERRIBLE,"I'm one of those people who assumes more expensive is better. Definately not the case here. The horrible, startling static that comes from this monitor keeps me up more than my newborn!"
1,Static all night long,This monitor sucks. We live in a small condo and get static every few seconds that goes on all night long and the baby is very close in the next room.This thing is a piece of JUNK. Do not buy it!
2,static static static,"Spend the extra $10 and get the Clear & Near Monitor. 2.4 GHZ really makes a difference. I haven't had any major problems with the Peace of Mind, but the static and interference will truly make you crazy."
4,works great!!,"I have read many complaints about this monitor set, but I have had great luck with it. Very little static and reaches long ranges."
1,Peace of Something.,"This product is a headache to listen to. It has lots of static, hiss, and interference regardless of which channel it is on. I was disappointed with the quality of the product. The battery compartment requires the use of a flat head screw driver and is flimsy. The craftsmanship of the unit is cheap. Luckily we were able to return our product and obtain a much better product. I would steer clear of this product. For the money there are much better units available that are clear and have numerous channels available."
1,Same problems as most everyone,"Unfortunately we didn't read the reviews before using this monitor. When it works it's great, clear and sensitive, but that is rare. The unit picks up interference from everything, refrigerator, hair dryer, sometimes unknown. You have to move the parent unit to find a clear signal and don't even try to walk around with it; maybe that's why they give you two receivers. It is useless when the phone is on."
1,horrible monitor,This monitor is soooo loud. The static is just awful. Don't even bother buying it. You will end up taking it back.
1,Don't waste your money!!!,I received this monitor as a gift and was very disappointed with it. I pick up my neighbors phone calls and hear their baby screaming over the monitor. Their is also so much clicking and static if you don't have it placed just right and just when you think you do and your about to fall asleep you hear a loud click or static that wakes you up! Don't waste your money on this monitor!!!
2,Static!!!,All I can say is that the static comes in much louder and much more clear than my baby's cries! The intermittent bouts of static are VERY loud so when we go to sleep at night I can't turn the monitor up to a comfortable level (to be assured I will hear my baby) with out chancing getting the heck scared out of us by the static! I got another monitor as a gift. I was going to return but have not done so yet. I think that I won't. I am going to see if it works any better than this one!
1,Dangerous Product! 0 Stars!,"The terrible static causes you to turn the unit off ""just for a second""... Invariably, you forget to turn the unit back on!I have suffered with this unit too long and I am looking to replace it.When its not picking up our neighbor's phone calls, it is emitting ear piercing static. I would say I have to ""turn on, turn off"" and relocate the unit at least once or twice a day!I can't believe a name brand company would put out something like this piece of junk!Dont buy it. 0 Stars!"
1,Horrible Monitor,"I'm pregnant with my first child and have spent months reading product reviews. When I saw this product, I had to pipe in. I'm a nanny and the little one I take care of has this particular monitor. Both of her parents, and I, are incredibly unhappy with it. The static is ridiculous and I find myself repositioning it and turning it on and off multiple times during naps. And while it picks up Avery's sounds, it does pick up everything else as well. I find myself constantly thinking she's awake from the noises and after treking upstairs, see that she's still asleep. I do not recommend this product at all."
3,It's alright,"We have only used this one a few times and had the parent monitor outside with us in our garage. Worked well at that point. We then put the parent montior in our bedroom and it made a clicking noise about every 1-2 seconds. Very annoying, especially with the volume turned up.We then moved it into our hall way outside of our bedroom door and the clicking noise nearly stopped. It was faint, but how many people want to have a monitor in your hall instead of your bedroom.We will be returning this one for a different brand."
1,Crackle and POP,"This is the worst monitor. I was so excited when my cousin and I both registered for it thinking wepicked out a good one. WRONG>>> it makes cracking noises, popping noises and plenty of static.I would not recomend this to anyone, especially if you would like to get some sleep."
1,Fire / Electrical Hazard for Recall,"BUY ANOTHER BRAND. 1) The electrical cord for the receiver melted after 6 months leaving exposed copper wire and a fire hazard. 2) In a rural area, with few homes, the receiver turns to loud static at frequent intervals. The unit must be turned off and on to regain a signal. Don't try napping when your baby goes down, because the ""The First Years"" baby monitor will keep you awake resetting its signal. 3) Drains batteries in a few short uses, leaving you to rely on a melted electrical cord. 4) DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM."
4,no problems with it,We recieved this monitor as a shower gift. I was worried when I saw all the negative reviews.. but ours works fine. Its clear and there is no static or any of the other complaints. I guess it depends on where you are located and what type of phone you have. Sometimes that can cause interference. It seems like you have to actually test any monitor for yourself to see what will work for you. I have read negative or positive reviews for all the monitors available so its just trial and error.
1,Don't buy this,"I purchased this product thinking it was similar to the 900mhz Crisp and Clear that I had for three years, boy was I wrong. It's full of static. It sounds like running water with the volume only turned up slightly. I can't believe some people would rate this product acceptable! I guess it's what you're use to. I'm returning this product and seeing if I can find the old version on ebay!"
1,AHHHHHH!!!!,"This monitor is horrible. All I heard was static, so much that when my son was crying in the middle of the night I could not hear him. My husband and I gave it about a month and then we couldn't stand the noise any longer. We took it back and got a much better one that was $20 less!!"
1,Piece of junk,"We received this as a shower gift. Unfortunately, it's useless. Every few minutes the parent unit seems to ""lose touch"" with the child unit, treating us to an earful of loud static."
1,Peace of Mind???? More like piece of CRAP!!!!!,"This thing is AWFUL! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! It either spews white noise at you when the baby cries or just doesn't pick up the baby. I called First Years and they were less than helpful. When I asked why all the static with this product vs my Fisher Price monitor that was over 2 years old.....the response....""Well this is better technology"". I'll take my older technology since it works better thank you.I returned the product to BRU without my box but with my reciept. They gave me a FULL refund. That's more than I can say for First Years. They would only send me out another unit even tho I did not want another unit.I have since purchased another Fisher Price unit and am more than happy with it."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS MONITOR!!,"My husband I decided to purchase this monitor because of the two parent units. All we hear is static. I called the company to complain. They replace the child unit and it still does not work. They tell me if you have 900 mhz phones, which we do not, these monitors will not work in your house. Now we are out $50.00 and will have to re-purchase another monitor that will work. I would STRONGLY advise against this monitor. Unless you want to hear static."
1,Snap Crackle Pop (& Static),"Hate it! This monitor keeps us up all night with the crackles and popping. If you walk past it, it goes crazy with static. If you set anything near it, like a glass of water, more static. We're tired of fighting it so we're replacing it with something better. Don't buy this monitor!!"
1,This monitor stinks worse than my son's diaper!,It took us about 5 minutes to determine that this monitor was a piece of garbage. All you hear is static!
1,Static City!!!,"I received this monitor as a gift and was very disappointed. For the price you would think its the best. The clarity is good you can hear everything that goes on in the room but When the batteries get a little weak and you walk by the monitor it is loud static that travels into the babies room and woke her up on several occassions. Even plugged in it made a loud static noise when the electric went off for 2 seconds which again woke my daughter up. I finally packed the thing away and bought the safety first safe glow 2 receiver monitor. So far so good. Do not buy that product, it doesnt give you peace of mind."
1,Don't Buy This Monitor!,I wish I had checked the reviews before I registered for this monitor. The popping and cracking are SO irritating that most of the time I just turn it off. DON'T BUY THIS MONITOR!
1,Barely better than no monitor at all.,"We bought this monitor based on a suggestion from another parent. Out of the two available channels, one had so much static that it wasn't usable. The other has some static problems, but not so much that I can't use it during the day. This monitor is NOT for nighttime use because of the static problems, and is not good for any more than short distances. Best works at a distance (base to receiver) of about 15 feet. If you have a large house or want to take it outdoors, count on lots of static. We're going to buy a different one, and read the reviews this time."
4,Good Monitor,"I really like this monitor. I didn't think that there would be that big of a difference between monitors, but when my second baby was born (my girls are only 18 months apart) I needed a second monitor. I chose Fisher Price for my second one so that I could tell which monitor went to which girl. Unfortunately, the Fisher Price model has MUCH more static and white noise when turned on than does this monitor (The First Years). I have decided to go get another set like this one and just mark each unit to tell the difference.The only reason I didn't give this monitor 5 stars is because is does SOMETIMES pick up neighbors' phone calls."
1,I thought the reviews were bogus but now I know...,"If I could have given this 0 stars I would have... So, I recieved this gift for a shower and I thought, well I better check it out online before I open it...the reviews weren't as bad as I thought, so I opened it, and tried it out before baby came...no static. I thought maybe this static thing only applies to others until I started using it more frequently after baby was born. It is worthless. I can't even take a shower without it going static on me, plus then you can't hear if baby is crying so it is worthless. I wish I would have listened to the other smart parents who wrote earlier reviews. Return this as soon as you can and purchase one with bigger indicator lights for when the baby is crying- that way you can see their sounds but not have to hear them."
2,too much background noise,"Although the monitors let me hear the tiniest sound my baby makes, there is CONSTANT background noise. No matter where I place the receiver, we hear a light click about every 5 seconds. Then there are frequent light bursts of static for a few seconds. And LOUD bursts of static that act like an alarm clock. I would not recommend these monitors - it is very hard to sleep with all the noise."
1,DO NOT BUY - the static is horrible,"I read some of the reviews of this product when I put it on my baby registry, but I didn't listen to the negatives. I wish I had! The static on this monitor is horrible, changing channels doesn't work. It makes this loud popping static sound, that freaks you out when you are dead asleep. Sometimes the static doesn't stop, it's just a constant sound. I can't hear my baby over the static. Just when you think you find the sweet spot for a location, you turn over in bed and it starts all over again!It is nice because it's portable. We can hot tub in our back yard while our baby sleeps in her room. Other than that, don't waste your time.I will be researching and finding a new monitor. I'm sorry I didn't listen to the previous posts!"
1,It'll Drive You Insane,I bought the Peace of Mind. What a joke! The infernal beeping every 30 seconds will make you insane. The clarity is good however but the beeping prevented me from sleeping. I thought maybe it was because it was plugged into the wall. I put batteries in and still it beeped. I've decided to trash it and bought the Safe Glow Monitors. Peace of Mind is a waste of money!!
2,Pretty Bad,"I am a first time mom and I thought this would give me piece of mind and allow me to sleep better when my baby is in her room but I was very wrong!!! The static is constant throughout the night, although, other reviews state to plug in it and the static is better, that is not the case with mine. There is a constant popping sound every few seconds that is very annoying. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.Keep looking if you want to rest at night!!!!"
1,Horrible Monitor!!,Not only does the static get so load that it wakes up us and the baby but it intercepts my neighbors phone calls!! I would return this monitor immediately if you get it as a gift!!
1,Horrible!!!!,"Believe all the bad reviews. We registered for this piece of junk without reading the reviews. We used the monitor for only 2 nights before returning it. My son would finally get to sleep, but then the stupid monitor would wake me up!! Besides the constant buzzing sound, it made a loud pop every 5-10 seconds. I think Babies R Us knows this is a bad product because they didn't fight me at all on the return. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,Pieces of Junk,"Don't waste your money with this monitor. We selected it because of its wo receiver and battery/take along features. However, within four months one of the receivers stopped working off the battery and then completely broke a couple of months later. The other receiver's battery feature also stopped working. Giving us only one receiver that did not function properly."
2,Not Worth The Money,"I registered for this monitor without doing any research. I recieved for a shower gift and used it. From the beginning, it had a lot of static. I just figured that it was normal. After about 9 monhts it quit working completly. I returned it and tried another one which was also had a lot a stict. So I decided to try one more. I had an old Graco one that I had bought at a second had store and thought I would try the newer one like it. I have had it for about 1 1/2 years and LOVE IT. It is so clear and nice. I recommend it to anyone looking for good monitor. It is a three peace set, and it was not very expensive."
2,Not Peace of Mind,This monitor may be peace of mind for the baby sleeping but not for the parents. The parent's monitors makes a continuous crackling noise and picks up a lot of interference because of the 900mhz. On several occasions it has picked up someone elses phone conversation. The constant noise drives me crazy and it only has two channels to switch back and forth from and I find that one channel is worse than the other.I am taking this back for one that will give me peace of mind.
2,STATIC!,"Well, I agree with the other reviews written & agree I should have read them BEFORE registering for this monitor. While we are tryng to provide a calm, peaceful setting for our two month old to fall asleep in, this monitor gives off such loud, obnoxious static noises that it startles ME, nevermind my little one!!!!! Time to research & find a better monitor!!"
1,Static Static Static,"I have tried severl rooms, plugs, positions etc. and all I get is static. I have written the manufacturer and they never responded. They just want your money. Every tiny noise in the house sets this monitor off. There is so much static that I couldn't hear the baby cry! I bought another brand (Sony) and it works great. I will never buy another product by First Years!"
5,Works great!,"We have been using the monitor for about 8 months, and we have had very little problem with it. We have experienced a little static on very dry days when the humidity in our house allows a large buildup of static electricity, but repositioning the base unit usually took care of it. We are dissapointed because we have to replace it. A neighbor somewhere in our area just bought a new monitor that has a more powerful transmitter than ours, and ours even picks up her transmission loud and clear with no static!"
1,the only thing you can hear is static,Had this product for a while and were very dissatisfied. The only thing you can hear is static. We got now Greco and very happy.
1,This monitor will make you crazy,"This is the second monitor we purchased. I was told this was the best one out there (by friends) and boy were they wrong. First of all, it clicks constantly and when it's not clicking the static takes its place. Each receiver takes 4 AA batteries and they don't last long at all. It works terrible in any kind of storm. We are taking this back. Buy the Sony one! Same price!"
4,Use it everyday!,"Despite other reviews, we think the monitor works great! There are two channels, A and B. As long as you have the monitor and receiver at the same channel is works great. We had a cheaper monitor initially and the static was horrible, but now that we have this one, we can hear our children anywhere in the house or outside."
2,static,"believe everyone when they say static. All of the sudden a very annoying static noise will come, to the point that you can not even hear if your baby is crying. It is bad enough that you are awakened every few hours during the night for feedings, but to be wakened to the sound of static. I will be returning this priduct as soon as I can move about."
1,WORST MONITOR - DONT BUY,"after purchasing the product, I read the reviews. Boy were these people right about the clicking sound. I am returning this monitor tomorrow. The clicking sound is unbearable. Do not purchase this monitor. The constant care 3000 is much better!"
1,very disappointing,"I read all the reviews on this model and thought I would give it a chance. Its performance has been horrible. The popping static is never ending, especially if there is any electrical devices between the baby and myself. This rules out using it in the kitchen, the living room and especially anywhere near the washing machine. In addition, use outside is equally as bad - we are on a clear open ranch. Its range does not even come close to what it claims and the static contiues outside where there are virtually no other electonic devies being used. The only time it works effectively I find my ears work almost as well."
1,Why does BABIESRUS continue to sell this defective monitor?,"Unfortunately we did not read the reviews before buying this monitor and simply fell into the ""Its more expensive so it must be a better monitor trap"".Simply put, this baby monitor cannot be used for its intended purpose. It sounds more like a geiger counter than a baby monitor. The static is so bad no matter where the parent unit is placed that you would be better off just shutting the unit off and listening normally.One buys this product to allow freedom of movement for the parents. A monitor should allow you piece of mind that although you may be in another room of your house, you can still hear your baby while he or she is asleep.Even though nearly every review on this board has shown this product to be defective, BabiesRUs continues to sell it without disclaimer. This entire line of monitors should be removed from shelves and returned to the manufactor for repair and sold monitors should be recalled.**Do not buy this monitor!!**"
2,"I didn't buy it, but I'm keeping it...EEK!!","My monitors do screech now and then, but for the most part, they do their job. I can actually turn the thing up and hear my baby breathing (loudly) which is really cool, since it keeps me from getting out of the bed in the night to check on him. It's not really something I would have bought. I do a lot of investigating (usually) before I buy, and I would have been turned off by these reviews. My mother-in-law bought it right after she found out we were pregnant. Sort of an impulse buy. I would take them back if I didn't think it would hurt her feelings. Besides, what's a little screeching anyways? We all need to be on our toes...we're parents now."
1,WHY IS THIS MONITOR EVEN ON THE MARKET?,"I am a first time mom and registered for this monitor before reading the reviews. I liked the thought of having dual monitors. I still gave the benefit of the doubt and tested the monitors before our baby arrived in just a few weeks. Thank goodness we did. One of the parent monitors was broken. We even switched outlets and batteries to find out what the problem could be. But had no luck. Being 38 weeks pregnant and exhausted, the last thing I want to do is return this product in exchange for another brand. My suggestion to all the parents is to do the research before purchasing or registering."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"The product doesn't work, and tech support is useless. My computer freezes after a couple minutes (or sometimes an hour or two if I'm lucky) of downloading EVERY TIME, and I have to restart which doesn't always work, sometimes I have to do it multiple times. The computer isn't overheating, the and I know that the card is the problem. Don't waste you money."
2,Fails after a bit of use.,"This product preforms well when it preforms. I am running Vista 64 bit, which is not supported with the drivers on the disc(I had to download it from the website) and this product often fails. After running my computer for a while, I will loose internet connectivity. I am still connected to the wireless network and have good signal strength, but no internet access. When i disconnect from the network and try to reconnect, it fails. Vista shows that i still have good signal strength though. Rebooting is the only fix. Tech support has not been helpful at all."
1,didn't work for me,"I ordered a different brand and got this one sent to me. I decided to give it a try anyway. I initially installed the drivers manually from the cd. The software disabled the login feature for my pc (using windows xp). I'm not sure if it disabled anything else. So I uninstalled it and its drivers and reinstalled letting windows do it itself. When working correctly, it picked up the wireless signal pretty good using only the connected antenna. The signal is about 30 ft away through 3 walls. Transfer speed stayed at about 36 Mbps. Signal strength was about 60-70%. After a couple days of use, it crashed my system. My pc wouldn't boot up. It kept freezing when trying to load the pci card. I was getting BIOS errors. So I disconnect the pci card and the pc booted up. Once booted up, I discovered that my antivirus software was messed up. I tried reinstalling the pci card, but it still didn't work. I've sent it off for a refund. The price may be cheap, but so is the product."
1,Big Mistake,"I knew from the minute it was opened, it was a mistake. The flimsy foam from which it is made makes it nearly impossible (probably impossible would be more accurate) for it to function in the way it is marketed. The velcro is not sticky enough to stay on the pieces and that eliminates a whole side--throw those pieces away now that they're sticky from the glue on the velcro. The cover for the mirror's velcro doesn't work--eliminate that. The pieces that drop into the box are cute and well made--but the box won't stay together for them to be dropped in. Basically, I have six box sides and pieces that may have been fun if it was durable enough to be used in the way it was marketed. Three weeks after opening it...in the trash!"
2,covergirl !!,"I heard this ""singer',not to be confused with an artist, on cable's music choice .i thought she gad a beautiful and sexy voice. These were songs i hadnt heard before.thought they were original. Should have done more research. She covers "" cover songs""And on this album she makes them all sound the same.songs i love by other artists, whether they wrote them or not... they picked well and not something recently done by someone else. Threw cd and concert on the floor and just had a fit! My bad for lack if research!"
4,"Warm temperatures, not enough beer line for high altitudes","First off, I live in Denver, CO (the mile high city) and there is not enough beer line to get a decent pour. I changed the tower out so I could pour 2 kinds of homebrew from 5 gal soda kegs. When I did, I added a couple of feet of beer line (from the included 5' to 7'). The line has to be about 7 ft long to pour decent here. Keep that in mind if you live in high elevations, this will NOT pour right with the included equipment. Another problem is temperature. I have it at the coldest setting and it is about 40 degrees. Beer needs to be at most 38 for a good pour. After reading the reviews on here, I am going to be calling them requesting a service call. If they can fix the temperature issue, this is a decent unit for the money."
1,wrong one,sent me a cheap one. not the stainless steel one i ordered. 600 dollars for an ugly plastic one. now what
1,Not worth Time or Money!,We have had our HBF Series for several years. This Kegerator (overpriced dorm fridge) is a piece of Junk. Problems from day 1 with thermostat. (1 touch can be the difference in 37 degrees or a frozen Keg or warm beer. Had Zero consistant kegs with same temp or head (Tried all kinds of fixes) on beer. Just bump the side and watch all the settings change on their own. We even had a pro from Rapids try and help out and he felt the same way. The Cooling (Giant Ice Cube) plate inside goes solid frost in a few days and the temp runs amock in the Keg. And 2 to 5 degrees IS important for draft beer. Its heading to the scrap yard and I am getting a compact commercial unit.
1,Terrible!,I bought this as a gift for someone. It was ordered and delivered promptly but the dispensing parts were missing. Since it was ordered from [...] I contacted them to send the remaining parts. They were mostly uncooperative and 16 days later the missing parts finally arrived from Haier as a warranty claim that was filed. I have no idea how Haier received a warranty claim because when I contacted Haier they told me I bought a refrigerator not a beer dispenser! Once the dispensing parts were installed I found out the compressor had a leak in it and needed to be replaced and now I'm waiting for those parts. So far it's been one month and I've paid for a gift that can not be used.
2,More Problems with Temperature,"I also have had problems with the temperature on my dispenser. At first, the coldest my unit would get was 40-42 degrees. Haier instructed me to disassemble the thermostat housing and turn the adjustment screw, which I did.Now the refrigeration kicks in at 40 degrees and cools down to 28 degrees before it stops!! That is a big variation in temperature! I e-mailed Haier and have not heard anything yet."
2,i had to modify this for colt PR20EVS 1hp,"I had to modify this base for my Bosch colt PR20EVSthe predrilled holes were for a different aluminum base. they did not line up or center w/ square baseI used the centering cone that came w/ bushing set( which I purchased from Rockler, fit the base perfectly) and then scored and secured w/duct tape using the orig. base as a template and drilled to match. take your time. drill press strongly recommended. I used 1/4 bits to keep each hole drilled lined up. and used a Dewalt 3/8 brad tip to achieve a flat counter sink for the bolt heads. end result the custom holes matched the factory holestime consuming but worth the effort for use with Port cable hinge tempas an after thought.Why wasn't it made this way from the startmy round base was perfectly flat"
4,Needs rework,"Not unlike many other reviewers I found that:1.) Guide bushings would NOT fit into the shoulder recess on this base. I scraped the opening with a razor knife until guide bushings would seat.2.) Base is not flat. I am going to mount it on the router & sand it flat. I am hoping that I can maintain parallelism, but I' not so sure that's possible.One other reviewer suggested using a Porter Cable base & redrill to fit. That sounds like a good option.12-28-09 update. It took 5 minutes to sand flat. Not a big deal. Total rework time (with item #1 above) was 10 minutes. This was quicker than making my own base. Considering the amount of time it takes me to tune up other new woodworking tolls, this was easy and nothing much to complain about. If I could change my *star* rating, I'd bump it up to 3-1/2 or 4."
5,Good product,Not much tiu can say other than it fits the Colt perfectly and accepts PC threaded template guides just as it should.
2,Fit?,"I bought this to go with a router I bought from Amazon, but even though Amazon recommends it for the specific model Router I bought it doesn't fit."
1,Never received,"Amazon's computer addressing system unable to print both a physical and PO Box on two different lines. Item was suppose to go UPS, but went USPS instead. I have only a PO BOX with USPS. The only address printed on the address label was my physical address, USPS sent it back as undeliverable. I could not get anyone at Amazon to listen to and understand this problem. The one star rating is not an equipment rating, Amazon would not let me publish this ""rating"" without at least one star."
3,Get a centering cone.,"This base does make the Colt a much more versatile router. It is easy to install, but hard to center. I do not have the centering cone so I had to use a 3/8"" round-over bit that just happens to fit the opening exactly. Even with the bit, the base wanted to creep over when the first screw was partially tightened. The only other thing to note is that after the base is installed, you can't put the router back into the case without removing it which means that you have to go back through the pain of re-centering it the next time you need it."
2,"Works Ok, but not flat",This base was seriously bowed (at least 1/16 of an inch) in the center; I had to sand it flat before using it.
1,Can't align it even with the cone,"The objective of the subbase is to be able to use template guides that are centered around the bit. The problem with this subbase is that Bosch, in saving a few sheckels, chose to have it cast out of high impact plastic. Unfortunately, the result is that there is 1/32"" camber in the base. Consequently when you mount it, it's not flat, it doesn't hold the guide template in the proper relationshiip with the base, and even the most minor adjustments to the height of the bit result in a misalignment of the bit to the template guide. I purchased the centering cone, but it had no effect on the usefulness of this base. Since you have to remove the motor in order to get the centering cone out (there isn't enough clearance, as there would be with a normal router), everything gets misaligned and you're better off moving the base around until you get it aligned manually. I wish Bosch would have made the base out of phenolic and machined it rather than having it cast."
3,Sony Music NOT Doing Tammy's Catalog Justice...,"I continue to be amazed as to why Sony continues to hack the Wynette music legacy. Where are tunes like ""I L-O-V-E Y-O-U"" and ""There Goes That Old Steel Guitar"" and Jones duet ""We Beleive In Each Other""!?! Is it a question of 'who owns the gold' (the Wynette family?) or is Sony just SO short-sighted that they can't get the QUEEN of County Music (REAL country music as far as I'm concerned, instead of these dolled up imitations we've got today) from the 60's/70's music catalog RIGHT.As good as the music is here, 3 stars, but that's not the point; this is soooooo disappointing to see the see the same line-up of songs on compilation after compilation. I grew up with this stuff, lived it to an extent, but vinyl records only last so long. This woman's LPs rank up there with anyone's - start doing it right for once, Sony.(There, I've said it...)"
3,Not Enough,"The remastering is great, the photos but I'm sorry Sony didn't go all out. The lack of tunes is a grave injustice. Someone of Tammy's stature deserves more than one short disc of remastered tunes. Far from ""essential""."
2,"311 going ""Down""?","I have to say 311 is one of my favorite bands and the album Transistor just doesn't cut it, if compared to other great cds that they've done like Music, Grassroots, and their self titled album 311 this is more of a quick step to try to find some new sound towards punk and some reggae, most of the songs on Transistor sound the same which makes little diversity in this album even though there are almost twenty songs on it. If you're not familar with earlier 311 works you may like this, otherwise sample this before buying i would say. In the future let's hope 311 won't let us ""Down"""
4,different but still good,A bit slower and a lot different to their other albums but still very good. It takes a bit of getting used to because it is slower but once you listen a few times it grows on you.
4,If you liked Transistor...........,"If anyone reading this even remotley liked Transistor, they should definatley buy another of 311's cds, preferabley Music or the self-titled album. These cds truly reflect what 311 is all about!"
3,3 stars=not half bad,"First off I would like to say I'm not a 311 loyal like a lot of the reviewers. The reason I happen to have this CD is I got it free in a radio station giveaway. The sound on this album isn't the sound I expected from 311. However, I found the CD to be somewhat refreshing. They obviously expirimented with a lot of sounds, most of which I found to be very pleasant. Some of the 21 tracks I could have lived without (particularly ""Strangers"" and ""Tune In""). But all in all the CD came out to me as a fairly good expirimental album. 311 isn't exactly for me, but if your looking for a refreshing album with some different sounds on it, go ahead and check this CD out. Stand out tracks by the way include: ""Beautiful Disaster"", ""What Was I Thinking"", ""Creature Feature"" (with that eerie bell in the background), and ""Rub A Dub""."
2,Unfortunately Disapointed,"After the great self-titled album, they follow it up with this. im a big 311 fan and waited for a long time for this new album to come out but i think this album is poor. beautiful disaster saves transistor from getting a 1"
4,Give it a chance - It grows and grows and grows and grows...,"I got this album not long after it came out and it was hard to get into. I had it for a week before I listened to half the cd. Then I went back and just played it through, like I did all my 311 cds, and I realized what I had been missing. I know how you feel, you don't like it. It doesn't sound like Music or the Blue album..Think about Grassroots though, that was an experimental album, right? Once you really play these songs and get used to them, they grow on you like mad. You will flip for this cd like you've never heard it before. And go get Soundsystem, too, because its the best album to come out of `99 and its right up there with 311's previous albums. These guys deserve so much more recognition. Get `em all and play `em loud! PS- these guys put on a CRAZY show! They are an incredible live band!"
5,this IS the best CD ever.,"This is the best CD, hands down. I have had it since the first day it came out and I still listen to it everyday. BUY IT. Break out your stash and steal some happy hours."
3,"Call me ""trendy"" if you wish..","I'm not going to tell you that I was a huge 311 fan (pardon the cliche) ""ever since"" Music debuted, I'm a ""Blue"" album starter kit kid"" as well. ""Transistor"" as a track is very excellent and reflects the style we grew used to, but the rest of the album, with much respect due to experimenting, as any band should do, doesn't appeal to me the way I became a 311 fan. ""Music"", to me, will always be the best album and true 311 experience, although ""Soundsystem"" totally blew me away this week.."
4,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"311 rips it up again with 97's ""Transistor"". 311 is my favorite band but I gave it 4 stars because it would've been better with more raps. It had a little too much reggae which got a little annoying but songs like: ""Galaxy"", ""Beautiful Disaster"", ""Star Shines"", and ""The Continous Life"" REALLY rocked this CD. This is a complete must have!!!"
5,Perfect addition to the 311 archive,"I have been a fan of 311 since 1993, and I had a hard time adjusting to the newest addtion. Of course, I got over my first impressions and now believe that ""Transistor"" is one of the best records to come out of 1997. The album is full, rich, and imaginative, and while the style has grown and matured, it is still good ol' 311. The presence of softer, spun out songs simply add to the magnificance of this album, and their classic edge is accounted for in many songs. The sound that is 311 is not easily classifiable; they are in a realm of their own. ""Transistor"" incorporates four songs mainly sung by SA Martinez and one instrumental number, and these pieces add greatness to the entire work. The CD is 70 minutes long and it will satisfy. 311 leaves no stone unturned in their latest effort, and they are still capable of making the finest music I've ever heard."
4,"its okay, but...","This cd was definitely not the best 311 has produced in their 10 year career as a band... but still not a bad cd afterall. Nick Hexum is not the best singer in the world... but you gotta give him credit, he can go off sometimes... Now SA is a different story... he is awesome, but i want to hear more of him... sorry nick. P-Nut is still awesome on bass... but i'm sorry, i think chad's time is up... Tim is okay, but pnut and sa are the reigning champs in this battle."
5,Very GOOD ALBUM,I love this album! It has all of the songs that we have come to know 311 by! FANTASTIC! Good Job Nick!
4,"It's everything ""311"".","I wouldn't say this is my favorite of theirs, but it is an extremely good disc. Two things are for sure, at 21 tracks it's their longest album, and it's also their most diverse album. You could almost find any genre of music on here, minus country, but still retaining that ""311"" sound. In fact there's so much music here, I still don't know all the songs by name. But it does include the hits ""Prisoner"" and ""Beautiful Disaster"", and other cool tracks like ""Electricity"" and ""Stealing Happy Hours"". This is a must for fans. Newcomers might just want the ""311"" album, or ""Live"". Maybe we'll get a ""Best Of"" soon."
3,don't waste your money,"i have every 311 album except Grassroots.Out of all the ones i have this was the only dissapointment.Every three or four songs on the album a good tune would come but this disc basicly sucked.It was too slow.311 was going down hill with one and didn't sell many copies of it.If your looking for 311 albums that don't suck, bye the self-titled 311 or get their newest album ""Soundsystem.""You won't be dissapointed with them as you would with this one unless you're a fan of the slower more popy 311."
3,good but not great,this cd has some good songs on it but it is not the best 311 cd. the best 311 cd is music. like i said good but not great.
3,Weakest 311 Album,"I have been a huge 311 fan for many years, and I still maintain that Transistor is their worst album. If you are a huge 311 fan then I recommend this, but otherwise, check out any of the other 311 albums. My ranking..1. Music2. Self Titled3. Soundsystem4. Grassroots5. From Chaos6. Live7. Evolver8. TransistorI would recommend any of the aftormentioned instead of this album."
2,"If its not metal, its crap.","Theres like 3 good songs on this cd ( the radio singles ).i like the few good songs, but the rest of this cd isnt as good. not worth your money at all."
1,El terrible,"Remember the self-titled 311 CD? Remember how good that was? This is NOT the self-titled CD! Transistor is the best song, and it's only mediocre by any standards. I sold this CD to a friend for $5 just to get rid of it, and now they're doing the same. Avoid it like the plague!"
2,Oh please...,"To whoever made the comment about ""Top 40 listeners look elsewhere"" I have to laugh. This album is perfect for the top 40, it's no less commercial than the album before it. In fact, it's probably more commercial. But let's not focus on that. Is there substance? Come on, this is a 311 record. Of course there isn't. When you get bands with little talent, you normally get cds like this.311 is an overrated act that needs to learn they should release ONE good album before making any others."
2,Dissapointing,"311 is my favorite band ever, but this album is just too reggae. The Self Titled album was mostly white rap, but it was more rockin' than this."
2,Selling Out?,"With ""All Mixed Up"" Getting tons of radio play in 96' 311 Decided to base most of their 97' ""transistor"" Realease on the same mello Style as there radio played out song. And while ""all Mixed Up"" was rather catchy, The sometimes boring songs on ""transistor"" Leave alot to be desired. Nick Leaves his rap style at home and tries to sing through most of the album, Only Martinez Brings it, and that isnt enough to get the funk started, For me, being a true 311 fan since the ""music"" Days, the album is a dissapointment. Hopefully they will kick it on their next effort!"
5,311,"I bought this CD twice...it was the accident of a tragic car accident and became ruined. I would buy it a million times again if I had to. If you are any kind of 311 fan, you would like this album, as it reflects thier changing nature. If you are one of those trendy 311 listeners who think this album is a letdown, follow the advice given..."
2,311 WAS hard,"this album is far too soft. musically it souds like punk reggae and pop fused ogether in 1 lousy mass. a few songs escape this fae though. 311 migh do something good with their new sound, but transistor isnt it."
3,"Trans""pister"" ?","I have to say that 311 is my favorite band and i love all of there CD's. But this one has to go one the bottom of the 311 stack. Are these guys gettin soft, or is it just me? Of the 21 tracks, I'd say about 7 of them are worth listening to over and over. This album is definalty not like its predicesors. I REALLY hope these dudes arn't going soft on me. Hey 311, please livin your next album up! You know what I mean...""IN YOUR FACE, AND IT FEELS SO GOOD"". Sorry guys this one didnt make me feel good."
5,Still hard to top,"With a 311 show fast approaching to Milwaukee's Summerfest, I wanted to make sure I was up to date on all their material. I felt compelled write a review of Transistor- 311's best album and one that rarely leaves my CD player after over 6 years. This album brings it all- a few hard tracks, a few reggae, ska, etc. the whole 311 gammit. I really enjoy two of the slower tracks the best- Use of Time and Stealing Happy Hours- perfect just to chill out to. Other standouts are Transistor, Prisoner, Continuous Life, and Rub a Dub- a really fun reggae-fused track that makes me feel like I'm sipping a tropical drink on the beach in the Caribbean. Overall- this is a great album- front to back and to produce something that remains tireless to this day really says something about a group. I highly recommended this CD to anyone."
3,It was OK,"I thought that 311 could have done A LOT better on the Transistor CD. There were a few songs on there that I really liked, but I found myself skipping through a lot of songs too. I really like 311, but this album is not as good as the rest."
5,THIS CD RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"My cousin left this CD @ my house by accident and i started listening and couldnt stop! all of the songs rule, Light Years, Prisoner, Transistor, Jupiter, Electricity, What Was I Thinking, all the songs are awesome!!!"
3,Too small for almost anything,"Okay, I'm not going to lie. I bought these because I love the colors. Unfortunately, the clips are so small that they fit almost nothing. Regular-sized chip bags, bags of rice, snacks...these clips are unable to close any of them. These clips would be great for bread bags, but that's about it."
2,Nothing but a DVD recording of Documentary & Training Seminar..,"This is nothing but a 3 DVD disks recording of a Documentary and training seminary on Ninjutsu. Each disk last about 1 half hour. Those giving 5 stars are probably participants themselves helping in promoting this DVD. Buy ONLY if you want to see GrandMaster Masaaki Hatsumi.I fast forward in between viewing 'cos it can be quite boring. So don't waste your money.I bought this DVD is b'cos of the many reviews that I read. So,don't trust reviews, including mine. It's your choice and your taste. Credits must given to the clear picture. Warning, there's no Chapters selection in all 3 DVDs."
2,"Not bad, not good.....","I ordered this so I could relive my childhood games, however, I only know 3 out of all 10 games. I give it a thumbs down for that.I don't recomment it."
1,SNOOZ-A-THON 3000,"I bought this toy for my little bro for Christmas thinking it would be a blast. It was so boring even my little bro who loves video games didn't want to play with it anymore after trying each of the games once for about five seconds each. It is hard to move around with the joystick thingy (the game doesn't respond to it very well) and with all the Playstation and Nindento's out you would think that they could come up with some better graphics than the old, bla, two demintional ones. I mean, at least make it all 3D and upgrade the games a little bit to make it more fun. Needless to say, we went right to the store and returned it."
1,A PEICE OF CRAP,I got this thing thinking it will be cool but it sucks it falls artart and will not work TAKE MY ADVICE dont get this.
4,Perfect for Kids,"My son, who is four, was always asking to play the video games when we were out. I could never bring myself to letting him because they are so violent. When I saw this product I was overjoyed! Finally a way to let him play video games without all the violence. And since I used to play these games myself I could actually sit down and show him how to play, leading to hours of fun together. So if you have children and are appalled by the violence found in today's video games then this is the product for you. And no big console to store!!!"
5,Neat retro games!,"When I bought this i thought I could have some fun with this. I like the atari2600 because its a plug-in-play tv game. It was a reasonable price and it works great. It has 10 games in 1. I love the games. It has: asteroids, yar's revenge, breakout, volleyball, and 6 other games. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a retro game lover. It is easy set-up and requires 4 double A batteries (AA's). Overall I love this game."
3,OK,"The bad thing about this is they don't tell you exactly what games are on it, so if you are expecting the great classics like Pac-Man, or Space Invaders, you're double O G (Out Of Gas) cause they're not on there."
1,Not compatible with modern tv sets,"Couldn't make it work. I have a sony, a toshiba and a samsung tv, it didn't work on any of those.. I'm returning it to the store."
4,Nice little item,"Well, this device certainly shows how computers have advanced. Back in the day, one of these games, Pong, required a sizable game console. Now the whole bunch is right inside the joystick. Too cool!"
1,Not fun for us :(,"I purchased this for my kids (3 and 5) but it has been very little fun. The major problem is the joy stick. It is so stiff that even I have problems using it. The second problem is that the software is buggy. For example, unlike the original game, when you are playing Breakout the ball moves FASTER when you move the joystick. It should move at its original pace, but instead it picks up speed proportionally as you move making it almost impossible to catch up with the ball.My advice is to blow your money on something else."
2,not as fun as i remember,"i bought this and the namco pac-man games at the same time because i couldn't make up my mind which to get. i had to have both since i was so pumped up to see both of them and hadn't played the games in years. i tried pacman/digdug/galaxian first and it was great! just like the arcade games i remembered. then i plugged in my atari. what a disappointment. i forgot how crappy most of those games were. if you're trying to decide between the two all-in-one joysticks, go for the pacman 5-in-1. you won't be disappointed!"
1,STINKO,"I got this as a gift and was very excited about playing all the ""old games""Boy was I disappointed !!!The joystick is virtually impossible to handle! Making the game extremely difficult to even play.DON""T buy this product...you will be very disappointed."
2,mildly entertaining,"I might buy this again if it cost 10 bucks, but anything above would be a waste of money. Mildly entertaining for it's vintage vibe, but otherwise I would not get it. Perhaps for a party for guests to screw around with, but it gets boring fast. might...might get it as a gift for a 2-8 year old, or 21+."
1,Not really like the original,"I was really looking forward to going back 20 years but these games just don't do it. They are not really like the old Atari games were and the joystick really makes it hard to play some games. Maybe I was expecting too much, but even my wife said, ""this is awful"". Oh for the days of Burger Time!!"
2,Boring!,"Ok, yes, these are the classics we grew up with but after playing Ms. PacMan plug n play, this was a yawn! I LOVE centipede and it was so OLD and basic I hated it. I guess I only remember the arcade version. I am returning this. My kids won't even enjoy playing it.The on that has PacMan and Dig Dug is better but the Pacman noises get annoying after a while.Overall, I say thumbs up to 5 in 1 Ms. Pacman except for Mappy."
1,Immediately nonfunctional,We were very excited to play these old games but unfortunately it did not work for more than a few minutes. It is interesting that the reviews that you can easily see on Amazon give the item such a good rating but I have seen other reviewers that had the same problems we had. The picture became corrupted with tons of non-game dots so that you couldn't see what you were supposed to see on the screen. Rather like a TV channel coming in as static. SNOW! We were definitely disappointed and wish we hadn't thrown away the money. Oh well.
5,Memories.. memories..,"This is a lovely game device that brings good memories. Yars Revenge is still as lovely as it was. Others as well.I wish Toymax makes more of this to include other rocking titles. I guess they will sell nicely.The device will lose color (NTSC) to black and white if the batteries get low. Don't worry!, it is not damaged.. just get better batteries..Enjoy!"
3,Atari Fans Beware,"Atari fans beware. These are not the actual games we grew up with. They are replicas which is not acceptable in this day of emulators. Graphically most of the games translated well. There are a few exceptions. The secret room in Adventure no longer gives credit to the programmer, for example. The audio, however, was poorly replicated in almost all the games. Yar's Revenge, for example, is unplayable the sound is so irritating. Asteroids and Missle Command also have disapointing sound effects. If you don't care about these things, well, the unit is only $20 and it's not a bad toy. If you want the actual Atari games, though, look for a used system on Ebay."
2,NO GOOD!,"I am very disappointed with this product. It's not even worth 20 bucks. The graphics/sounds aren't even close to the original games. Plus, it doesn't even work properly. TOO many glitches have started appearing and it's only been used a few times. (and not by abusive children, but by adults) Please don't waste your money on this poorly made product. MS pacman one is bad news too."
4,Just like old times...,"It's really cool to see all of this packaged in the Classic Joystick of all things. I do admit some of the games that need a paddle are harder to play. I do miss some of the favorites and wish Combat would have been include above all. The one game you got when you started was Combat. Next would have been Space Invaders and more and likely Pac Man. Some really cool games are still available and for the money and a trip back, its well worth the price and a lot of fun at a party."
4,My hand is pleasantly cramped,"Ahhhh, I bought this toy for my husband's thirtieth birthday, and what a joy. It so takes us back to simpler times and absurd game plots. My hand cramped up just like old times. All our friends think this thing a cool conversation piece and who dosen't want to play those crazy 80's games again."
2,Sluggish Response,"This is a great idea, poorly executed. Other reviewers are correct in that the sound effects are not accurate reproductions of the originals. The major flaw; however, is response time. There is major lag between when you move the stick, or press the fire button, and before this action happens on the screen. Breakout was almost impossible to play because of the inability to get the timing down. The movements of the paddle on breakout were also very erratic. It was difficult to move in a controlled fashion, all I could achieve was a jerky dash across the screen. I grew up playing Atari 2600 and could roll the score on almost any game there was back then, and I am sure that my complaints are not simply the results of a ""foggy memory."""
3,Atari Games fun but too hard for little one,"We bought the Atari games for our 5 year old son's birthday and although he enjoys the games, the joystick is very tight. It isn't as easy to control as I would have hoped so he can't control where it goes so ends up crashing most of the time. My husband & I enjoy the games but also find it harder to play than it should be. An easier joystick would make the games fantastic and a real blast from the past!"
2,NO BERZEKER!!!,"You know, out of all the classic atari games, they choose not to put in one of the best.My nephew has this, and there's no Berzerker in it. How the hell is that not in there? And I'm not just talking about this little handheld, I noticed those Atari consoles that have up to 75 games in them. Well you'd think that Berzerker would be in there somewhere, but hell no! Not even a revised version of it. Hell I wouldn't even mind that as long as they kept it alive. I tried to explain it to my nephew on what the game was like, he just stared at me with confusion. He didn't know what the hell I was talking about. I feel that he's missing out on that game.I refuse to buy any Atari console for him, if they don't have Berzerker in it."
3,Needs a paddle too!,"The games from the atari 2600 are great, but some used a paddle, others a joystick. For Asteroids, Adventure, etc. the system is great! For Breakout, Circus Atari, etc...it's TERRIBLY frustrating as you can NOT contol your movement! NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!!!"
4,well worth the [price]..,picked up this unit. what can i say? it's portable. it has great historical value and it's fun. you can pick it up. play a few games for 10-15 minutes and put it down (unlike many of the complex games out these days). portable. no extra things to drag around.only complaint is lack of documentation on how to play/score/change settings on each game..
2,Atari Classics 10 VASTLY INFERIOR to Flashback 2 alternative!,"As a 33 year old classic Atari fan, I am sorely disappointed by this product. The games are poorly duplicated versions of the original. The details and controls are not authentic. It completely ruins the nostalgia factor for me to play ""Adventure"" where practically everything is a different color that the original. You can't tell which dragon is chasing you. The old paddle games are not adapted well to joystick control. Gameplay is frustrating and choppy.Paradoxically, the FLASHBACK 2 from Atari is spectacular. The sound, detail, and control is purely authentic. It is fun to play like the original. I have no idea why one version was done with such better care than the other. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the Flashback 2.The 2 person plug and play Atari paddle system is also fantastic. I recommend them as well."
4,I love Centipede,"I was so excited to get this game. Extremely easy to set up and I just couldn't believe that I didn't have to have a game console. Very easy to take with you when visiting friends or family. I too would've liked to have Space Invaders and Pac Man, and I wondered why breakout and pong were so hard--the joystick just doesn't work that little rectangle well enough. Oh, and be prepared to get some major cramping in your left hand. You have to hold the bottom of the joystick and push the fire button with that hand, and because the bottom is so much thicker than it was back in the old days it is harder to hang onto it."
3,Cute but OUCH,"These heels are really cute, but they kill my feet and they are really slippery on the bottom. They hve no traction. I've almost fallen a couple of times. If you are going for looks over comfort and safety, then these are the shoes for you. Me, I only wore them twice."
1,This tool belongs in a landfill,"I bought this because it looked like a good system. Unfortunately, it is worthless. The first one I bought seemed to be stripped so I took it back. Nobody's perfect right? Wrong! The second one was stripped even worse. Mind you, I wasn't even able to compress one connector even a little bit. Under almost no pressure, the tool immediatly stripped. The reason is obvious. First, the nut that supports the screw is oversized and poorly machined. Secondly, the nut is aluminum. They chose the wrong area to save a few cents, and it shows. DO NOT BUY THIS TOOL!!!!!!!"
4,Worth a read,"I was skeptical at first but this book is defintely worth picking up. The character of Nazli deals with obsessive compulsive disorder and the writer's depiction of some of the symptoms really hit home. I really liked the fact that you actually got to see what the victim of such a disorder goes through in their own head. And the issues she dealt with in her family life while suffering from this were really universal, although it was interesting to read about the cultural issues she had. There were some slow parts and I wish I knew more about her son but overall, its a good read."
4,difficult but ultimately rewarding,brad laner who is the electric company is really cool if his records were more readily available the would sell real good within the idm community. this one is pretty easy to find but not a real good first purchase of his as it is a difficult listen but it is very creative all the same and a wonderful album once you get used to it. but if you are truly interested in the electric company track down slow food on planet mu it is a very good starter record for his material
4,Literally Drew Blood!,"I thought when I ordered the books that all this thrash about the packaging MUST be overblown. But this is, without a doubt the worst packaging I've ever dealt with. Though the plastic case was damaged in shipping it was still a struggle to free the books. When pulled apart (which is what a small sticker on one of the books advises) the plastic shattered. One piece dug into the palm of my hand and gave me a pretty decent gash. Other smaller fragments ended up all over my room. All I could think was thank God I didn't lose an eye! Even then I only succeeded in liberating one book.The books themselves are very nice, and were only slighty damaged in the ludicrous struggle to liberate them from the case. It's comical that they come in the worst designed packaging you can imagine.So while I would recommend the books, I also strongly suggest protective eye wear for the unboxing."
1,To bad it was broken,"Please beware, This package will reach you with the case for the books broken. Yes, this book set comes with a plastic case, when they send it to you it breaks in transit. I should know they sent it to me twice. When i asked to have the case sent alone, I received an automated reply that had nothing to do with my question. Maybe you will have better luck!"
1,Don't order this product from Amazon,"Same as the case for a couple of other reviewers, this product was broken and banged up when it arrived because it was poorly packed. One later reviewer said their's was packaged quite well and perhaps Amazon had learned their lesson; well they hadn't. Although a full refund is promised, it'll still be a hassle to take to a shipping drop-off. It's hard to believe that a virtual business depending 100% on 3rd party shippers doesn't know how to pack merchandise, particularly a product with a history of shipping issues documented on it's own web site. I'll buy the replacement at Barnes and Noble where I can make sure the merchandise isn't damaged before I pick it up."
2,Phaidon Design Classics (3 Volume Set,"Books are great overview of classic designs, but Amazon service is horrible. The carry case is one of the worst designs ever but customers would be lucky to see it. The way Amazon ships the product, the carry case (a flimsy pastic) breaks in shipping. Amazon refuses to ship the carry case alone and states that it is not their problem but that of the manufacturer. They will offer to send a replacement set once (books and carry case), but it will come broken again as they do not ship it differently and you have to set up return shipment of the original package."
5,He is a genius,"He was definitely one of my favorite people I heard of from the GRP label of Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen who founded the label back in the late 1970s. I adore him since he been out. I seen him on most projects with the Chick Corea Electric Band, Dave Grusin, Wayne Shorter, The Chick Corea Akoustic Band, Hubert Laws, just to name a few. He sure is one-of-a-kind legend to all bassists and mostly most jazz players. I still have this on tape but 1 of those days I'll have it on CD. This is sure is a good album and I luv to hear more albums from him."
3,Good set just not a good case,I got this set to do some repare of my old Canon AE-1 SLR camera. The sizes can also be used for eye glasses screws. The tips are fine quality and the handle is easy to operate. However the case they came with can make you lose the tips. For the price you can also find more screw driver sets that contain more sizes and types.
3,A mystery/romance suitable for Mulder and Scully,"Meredith Allen has come to London, England to give a series of lectures on parapsychology. The last thing she wants is the surprise arrival of Jackson Hawke, a private investigator who loves debunking the supernatural events she attempts to study. But both Meredith and Hawke have been called to Croft Castle, where a woman with a strong link to Meredith believes that a ghost is haunting the estate, which is why Meredith was called in. However the man of the castle does not believe in ghosts, so he insists on having Hawke investigate the realities of the matter. So believer and skeptic are forced into a partnership to investigate the mysterious events at Croft Castle. Things start to get interesting when they begin to suspect that they both might be right, that the natural and the supernatural are at work at Croft Castle. An entertaining mystery romance that fans of Intrigue's Eclipse line will no doubt enjoy."
3,A Ghosthunters Romance,"Set on a small island off England, ghost hunter Meredith Allen, along with private eye Jackson Hawke, investigates the strange occurrences happening at the Croft Castle. Of course, this castle is your typical haunted castle with secret passages, eerie lights and ghosts.Jackson is a non-believer of the supernatural and believes that a human is responsible for the strange happenings at the castle. At first, Meredith wants nothing to do with Jackson, but this is a romance novel, so she falls for him. They explore the castle and uncover a dark mystery.This was an easy fast read for me. One thing that really bothered if Meredith was suppose to be a ghost hunter, why didn't she have any ghost hunting gizmos with her? The book cover says this is a gothic romance. Beside for being set a castle, I never really got the feeling that this was a gothic novel. Overall, I enjoyed the novel because of its fun characters."
2,"a nice looking banjo guitar, but essentially unplayable","This is a nicely constructed banjo guitar, however the tuners make it essentially unplayable. All of Lark in the mornings banjo's (I have owned 3) come with the same tuners, wich are set to a very low ratio. By this I mean that it takes very, very little movement to change the tuning of the string, so its very easy to overshoot your correct note. On the banjo's it was not as much of a problem, however, on the 6 string guitar banjo it makes it untunable.I give this instrument a 2 star rating instead of a 1 star rating on the assumption that replacing all 6 tuning machines would essentially make the instrument playable. However - you should never have to do this with an instrument that costs 250$+."
4,Value for Money,"I purchased this scale a few weeks back, and the experience has been pretty satisfactory. To get an accurate reading, you need to keep the scale on a hard surface. My weight came up very close to what I had weighed on the doctor's scale sometime back. Also, the scale has a button at the back that you can use to toggle between weight in pounds as well as Kgs. The display is quite big and it's easy to read while standing on it...on the whole I'm quite happy with this scale."
1,Don't bother...,"Just got it and it sure is interesting to weigh yourself and have it fluctuate 1.5 pounds every 30 minutes. Yes, it's on a flat surface. No I am not moving it around.good thing I saved the box."
1,Too inaccurate,"Not only did this take a month to get shipped to me, it didn't even work. The scale has to 'calculate' your weight each time you step on it and you MUST stand PERFECTLY still for 30 seconds or so before it will show your weight. 3 out of 10 times it would work with most times it showing ""ERR"". When it did finally read my weight it was different EVERY time. Never once did I see the same weight pop up. Not only that, but it was off by about 20 pounds?!? I kinda liked seeing 215 when I knew I was 235.. but I can't keep a product that doesn't work consistently.A real shame.. because I really loved the big display and huge surface. :("
1,awful book,"I got a copy of this book for free, and I gave it back after reading the intro and a few chapters.It's basically a series of high-school level essays about various ""serial killers"". Included among actual serial killers like Jack the Ripper and BTK are William the Conquerer, Saddam Hussein (a mass murderer, perhaps, but I've never heard him called a serial killer before), and Mary, Queen of Scotts. Most accounts seem pretty accurate in the historical details, although very superficial, but the motivations assigned to the killers don't mesh with modern behavioral/forensic psychology, at least in the sections I read.There are a lot of very good books out there that really delve into the question of what makes some people kill in this way and what we can do as a society, but this book isn't one of them."
1,Awful excuse for a book,"Beyond te atrocious writing, the author, first off, doesn't even define serial kilers properly. Al Capone, to use just one example, wasn't a serial killer, no matter what kind of semantics you wish to use. Second, he leaves out some of the most infamous serial killers in history. And third, the book is riddled with all sorts of historically incorrect statements. Complete waste of time."
1,Awful,"This is the worst book I have ever read. In many chapters, multiple paragraphs are repeated in a baffling cut and paste job.Not wanting to subject anyone else to this book, I am going to recycle it in the hopes it becomes toilet paper or a run of ""Sorry I gave you Syphilis"" greeting cards."
1,Yuck.,"This book is terribly written. It almost seems more like a 4th grader's report on various historic figures, most of which are NOT serial killers. The book is riddled with typos and errors, too."
1,It's an excellent jacket !,"Indeed, it's confortable, elegant, and pretty useful, specially for cold nights !"
2,Not for beginners,"While this book is supposed to teach you as if you don't know, it assumes a great deal. While it does have a good number of items fully explained, the step by step didn't follow the NT4 Server I installed. In fact, it missed several chunks. Additionally, I found the material either outdated or just way off in regard to the basics such as partition sizes. Even intermediate windows users would know the author is either missing something, or did his installs several years ago. Good explanations but not good as a unit."
1,Misled by the Title,"With no description to go by, I had to assume that the title described the book. Received it, and instead of information about West Virginia SONGS, like the title says, it is a book of poetry - totally not what I wanted. Not a ""song"" in the book!Amazon - it would sure have helped me to at least have the one word description of ""Poetry"" put with this listing!"
4,Fairy Chasm Road,"For anyone who has ever wondered how it could ever have been named Fairy Chasm Road, or who Plankinton was, this is the book for you. Lots and lots of local history tidbits. And unlike some books of this type, it isn't afraid to say, ""Gee, we just don't know why its named that. But here are a few theories."" Definitely a must own for the Milwaukee history buff."
3,Ashkenazy's first attempt at climbing this peak!!!Not as successful as his second,"Please see my review of Ashkenazy's most recent version with the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra on the Ondine label.This Decca version was issued prior to the recordings by Karajan and Haitink and by their side now does not really begin to compete,even less with Ashkenazy's own new version."
3,Okay,I ordered this item because Carter says it's fuel pump has anti-vapor lock features. I paid about $10. more for this item because of the advertized feature. The item does not have the Carter name on it so I guess it's made by a bulk manufacturer. I'll have to see how well it works come hot weather.
1,another idiot for peace,Another book by someone who has never lived in the real world. The entire idea is based on a WORLD system of talking and praying that just talking will make people who want you dead suddenly change their mind and love you. One of the most incompentent and socially idiotic books to be written in the last hundred years. Peace works with peacfull people but Tommy Boy seems to think that you can magically change evil people into loving teaddy bear holding happy people.
1,"Not satified, wrong lens with no return policy","Ordered a KDT60 ,as shown in picture, and received a KRW-075.Tried to return this unit to ""Gizmos For Life"" and was unable due to the no return policy. Cost me $79.77 I now have a lens for no use to me."
2,haier dual compartment freezer,"the product is an average product, do not think it is a top seller, another retailer has the same item cheaper.. the delivery and customer service is the wrost I have ever experienced.... would not order this item again with the poor delivery."
5,"So far,so good.","A nice little freezer which takes up very little space.2 drawers make it very convenient.My daughter is on a special casein,gluten free diet and I was running out of room in my small side by side frig that I hate anyway.Hopefully by having room for extra diet -allowed goodies for my daughter, it will help her comply w/her diet and be more willing to stay on it.Also freezer got very good reviews which is something I definitely look at."
2,Bottom drawer a waste,The top portion of the freezer works great. The bottom drawer portion sounded great - no more digging to see what's at the bottom. The reality is that the bottom drawer is only useful as overflow from my refrigerator. I don't put anything in that part that I'm not willing to store at regular refrigerator temperatures. It's a disappoinment.
4,Don't want to do without it!,"While the instructions aren't well-written, it wasn't that hard to put together. It took a couple of tries to clamp the drain pipe such that it didn't leak (I tried it a couple of times to check it before I did a whole load.) Connections for water/drain are easy. I usually do one-two loads a day, with one being a goal. It spins the items well. I don't have a dryer, but hang items on a couple of racks above my dehumidifier (has a blower that works perfectly for this) and I save money on dryer and reduce wear on my clothes. Even dries towels. Takes up to 24 hours, but that's okay!Worst experience was forgetting to put the drain pipe in the sink. A one-gallon wet vac is NOT sufficient for such an occurrence!"
1,Damaged and leaks,The washer i recieved from Amazon was damaged also and had a hole in the wash tub and leaked all over the floor. Now how to box it up and send it back. The original box was so damaged that there is no way to send it back in that box.
3,Not as good as I thought,The surface of the washing machine got several damages. The whole shell is distorted. I cannot install the wheels.
1,"STAY AWAY, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!","i ordered the 8.8 washing machine and it arrived broken. i was willing to keep it, if they would have sent out a repair man. I called Haier and they didn't care it was broken and stated. ""send it back"" so i did!!! I called amazon and asked for a refund.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!! I Read the bad reviews but thought it would not happen to me."
4,Nice machine - Poor Instruction Manual,"Machine is nice looking and arrived fast. Instruction manuel has poor drawings and instructions, but you can figure it out if you think outside the box. The given dimensions of the machine are correct, but they forget to tell you the drain hose exits on the side adding close to 1 3/4"" to the width... which almost made it not fit my space. The supply hose attaches to the top surface of the machine, ruining it's sleek look. Why both hoses weren't designed to exit the rear of the machine makes one wonder.Capacity is very decent, better than the 20 year old Sanyo it is replacing in this hair salon. I'll write again after a month of use doing towels daily."
5,I love this washing machine!,It is efficient and beautiful! It works very well. Very good for small family.
5,Schumann Piano Works Vol 4,This is Ashkenazy's earlier works of Schumann and the recording ages well. There are many Schumann' recordings in the market. But I enjoy this younger version of Ashkenazy than the older version of Kempff.
5,great album,if u are a deep purple fan this is a good one for you. the former singer of deep purple proves he still has it after being let go from deep purple. the whole band is great
2,Remastering ruined this classic.,In an attempt to add the additional high frequencies that were unattainable in the analog format which this record was originally recorded in capricorn ruined one of my favorite records of all time. Speeding up the music to add high end turned the elegant jazz time signatures into a frantic mish mash.
3,beyond 3 plus,any drummer should listen to this album and any other thing you can find with Bobby Caldwell.
3,Now here's something you don't hear every day...!,"If you've ever wondered what Yes would sound like crossed with the Allman Brothers, then here's the album for you!I was aware of this band for years, but had somehow avoided hearing them until last year when I picked up both this, their debut, and their second effort Sufficiently Breathless. I can't say that I hold this in the same regard that some of these other fine folks represented here; it's definitely well crafted and tuneful but it's all so leaden and earnest that the overall effect to me is like that section of Disney's original Fantasia with the hippos dancing a ballet...their heart is in the right place, but the result just doesn't hit the right spot.That being said, if you're into 70's stuff such as Wishbone Ash, Cactus, Deep Purple and the like, then by all means give this a shot. It does rock out in places and often is surprisingly clever... ...now if I could just stop snickering when I hear it!"
2,A Good Sleeper !,"I finally fell for it and bought it on Lp. While I kinda enjoyed the beginning it eventually put me to sleep, seriously, I fell asleep, so it was either really good for relaxing, or not worth the fan fare given on other reviews here. Thats ok though next time Im tired and winding down maybe Ill play it again."
2,I guess you had to be there,"I bought this unheard. I based the decision on the many reviews and references I have seen on this album. ""One of the great forgotten gems of prog rock"" was a typical catch phrase. Uh, I don't think so. I gave this one several listens. Put it on a shelf. Pulled it out many months later. Several more listens. Back on shelf. Tried again...nothing. I gave this album more than your average amount of chances and I just didn't get it.Average early 70's rock not much more exciting than your average Uriah Heep album. I did finally figure out where all the good reviews on this were coming from - Drummers. I have to admit the drumming on this disc is first rate, which makes listening to the rest of the mundane musicianship that much more annoying."
1,thumbs down,"This music has strings attached that bum me out. I bought this around 1970 as a vinyl. The guitar player I had heard previous to him as a member of Iron Butterfly. He was in a group in Jacksonville named The Load and then The New Second Coming. They played at the Jacksonville Beach Auditorium around the time of The Allman Brothers and The Seond Coming. They had a similar sound like CB, w/meracas used a little. They had some songs that I don't recall the names of, but there was one named ""Medulla Oblangata"". Because this song is not on CB or any other of CB's albums, that's why I get bummed out. Or what about the other songs TL and TNSC did? They are not on any of CB's 3 albums. There are no recordings of this song by any of Larry Rhinehardt's groups. I had to rate this album with only one star. I don't own any of CB's music anymore. They're a ripoff."
5,Could I get a re-master?,"I love this album! However, this CD release sounds really tired. Perhaps someone could remaster with a better sonic touch?"
4,captain beyond,i'm still somewhat surprised that this disc is even available. it is afterall somewhat obscure. It takes me back to a simpler time when classic rock was really taking off and we were there for the ride. At the time I had no idea these guys had a deep purple connection therefore I now listen to it from a different perspective. All in all it's great stuff and I'll be sure to check out other rare jewels I can find through your service.Rock on!
5,excellent hard hitting,Its the best of catain beyond. Bobby caldwell at his best beating the old pig skin what a great drummer. This album will realy get you cranked up.
4,Captain Beyond - self-titled (Capricorn),"Review no.95.Have always loved this band's name.Don't you?I mean,come on,CAPTAIN BEYOND!Has a nice ring to it,don't it?Originally released in 1972 as this was Beyond's first of just three lp's.Too bad they didn't exist very long.Just basically well written/good sounding early '70's hard rock.I remember these guys when I was in junior high.Tracks that I thought had Beyond making a lasting impression were the ripping ""Dancing Madly Backwards"",""Myopic Void"",""Frozen Over"" and ""I Can't Feel Nothin'"".Line-up:Rod Evans(Deep Purple's original singer)-vocals,Larry Rheinhart-guitar,Lee Dorman-bass and Bobby Caldwell-drums.Might appeal to fans of Cactus,James Gang,Blue Cheer,Humble Pie,Deep Purple and Johhny Winter."
5,Nothing else can be said.....,....the reviews and 5 stars speaks for themselves. If you don't own it then you have missed out on one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. One other piece of advice....play it LOUD!
5,uncomprimised,"A group loyal to making music heartfelt, regardless of record sales. You don't see that anymore. I first heard this album in 1979 and I have been in search of it ever since, whether it be LP and now CD. Mesmerizing."
4,Finally available again!!!,"I had this on vinyl with the 3D cover and 8 track tape. This album was released while I was in college. I listened to this album hundreds of times. When I saw this title available on CD, I snapped it up immediately. The albums that followed weren't quite at good. This is still my favorite CAPTAIN BEYOND album. If you can find this disc, buy it."
2,Crashed and burned,"DVD did not live up to its promise, much of the video is of poor quality, I suggest you give this a pass."
4,Bobby Miller took a ridiculous concept and turned it into an independent short film. An inspiration to filmmakers everywhere!,"I've been a fan of Bobby Miller's stuff since Best Short Films In The World and it's really cool to finally see a film made by the man himself.I'm in my last year of high school and next year I'm going off to film school and its great to see someones idea become a reality and then to witness it gaining success and getting into Sundance.The idea is brilliant (very unique) and its told in a very dark, creative and hilarious way. I hope Bobby can keep making short films or move on to a feature!Anyway its an entertaining short film and I recommend watching it!P.S. I had to omit a few sentences because of the lude themes of the film...-Julian"
1,poor quality,"petal fell off while riding and almost had accident on busy street. Don't buy - poor quality, waste of money."
3,Huffy Mens' Granite 26 Inch Mountain Bike,"I'm disappointed, I thought this bike would speak hirer being a Huffy. I am wrong in various ways. I put the bike together and then out of fifteen gears, I have five. The bike looks very cool and is a self assemble,but I am not happy to have to take it to a bike shop to pay for adjustments. I decided to ride the bike for a while and then the front rim bent. This happened the same day the pedal fell off. Now I might not have tightened the pedal as tight as I should have, but that doesn't explain for a bent rim. I've riden a Schwinn for years and not once have I bent a rim. I think I'll be modifying this bike quite a bit. Its not the worst bike in the world for a 100 bucks , but I plan on spending more. So, if you want to buy a cheap bike and have enough cash for some modifications, this is a good one. I'm not trying to say anything againt AMAZON or the seller. Huffy/Made in China"
2,Cheap bicycle with faulty parts.,The gear shift does not stay in place when shifting gears. Chain fell off on first ride do to shifting problem. Many parts made of plastic and do not look sturdy. Cheap bicycle.
3,ok - it's a cookie cutter,It works fine...pretty flimsy compared to other cutters I have. It will be prone to getting bent as time goes on. :(
2,Poorly written look into the history of the gene,"Keller has a different writing style then most ""factual"" books. Her attempts at literal hooks (ie. introduce ideas that explained later in the chapter) are more frustrating then informative. If the ideas are so imperitive to understand, she should explain them immediately after she introduces them. This is more of a historical look into the gene than a factual. If you want to learn how the gene works and its role in DNA computing - this is not the book to buy. Even more annoying is her constant ""insight"" into how surprised researchers of DNA were to learn that genes are complex. Of course they are complex. I wish she would have mentioned it once and continue writing useful information."
3,Very Good Movie.,If you are into lesser know hero's of WWII then this is a movie for you. The woman was determined to assist in kicking the Germans out of a country that was not her home country because she love the people of France. This Women is a true hero in every respect and paid a very high price for resisting the Germans as you will see when you purchase this movie.
3,Re. False Accusations,"This book starts off with a high interest hit and run. A female character who is every man's nightmare is introduced at the same time that Dr. Madison is accused of driving the hit and run car. Brittany Harding makes a career of taking offense and verbally stalking everyone she deals with. There are too many pages of Brittany's repeated offenses and the troubles she caused the good doctor with the sterling reputation. It's a real stretch of the imagination for the police to believe that Brittany stole Dr. Madison's car, killed two people, and returned it. Dr. Madison, however, calls in a favor from a top notch investigator to help prove his case. The book is tedius in the middle but has a knockout of a surprise ending. I was glad that I finished it."
1,Irritating ending - pretty dumb detectives,"So, it takes a special investigator from across the country to think about ordering lip prints and DNA for the beer cans found in the back of the car? And what about those multiple chapters of the boring in-house fighting over jurisdiction over labs? Painful. And no cop ever asked about a second set of keys for his car? His wife had to come up with that? Pretty lame. And the ending was maddening -- who was the killer? You still don't know whether he is saying he did it or he is saying that circumstances forced her to do it. Gosh, anyone can get a book published I guess."
2,"The more I read, the more disappointed I was","This is a so-so book with a poorly developed plot and disappointing characters. I had absolutely no one to root for. Madison was a wimp who let everyone do for him. Chandler, at the end, pulled the sheets over his head and went on with his dreary life. And how could the author drag us along through a boring trial and reward us with such a contrived ending? As a fellow writer, and an avid reader of the mystery-thriller genre, I believe the creative talent exists, but the author could do a lot better. Keep trying!"
2,Great read but horrible ending--makes no sense,I was really into this book. But I will NEVER read another of his books.Why waste all that time and come up with an ending that makes no sense. You almost have to figure out yourself how it really should be ended based on the last sentence.
3,Poor ending,I was extremely disappointed in the ending of this book. It was not logical and caught me completely by surprise. I regret that I spent the money to buy this book!
3,Clearly his first book,"After hearing some of the rave reviews, I was excited to read Mr. Jacobson's novel, especially because it is set locally. I felt the characters were poorly developed. Madison was a wimp throughout the book who made very poor, unbelievable choices, yet we're supposed to believe his outcome...I don't think so. Brittany Harding was the most well-developed character, yet there were also some questions regarding her outcome in the trial. The trial scene left some unanswered questions. It is clear Mr. Jacobson has some good knowledge in forensic science as that was the most interesting part of the book. His writing style needs growth as he uses too many cliches. Not a bad first attempt, but not a book I would highly recommend."
3,Old Story Retold,"I definitely could put this book down and did for a couple of days. In fact, I could not recall the title from memory. This novel appeals to those who enjoy a fast-paced read without any substance. I agree, its a good book to take on a plane as it requires no concentration or thought. The story line is old, the characters superficial and poorly developed, and the verbage is trite. If you have insomnia then this is a book for you. If you enjoy good writing...skip this one."
5,"Great Book and OMG, The Ending!","I love Alan Jacobson's work! I'd read all of the Karen Vail books available (I hope he does more!) and after reading 2 books by other authors with characters I didn't like, I decided I'd read Jacobson's first, to hopefully get the bad taste of those other 2 books out. This book did that and then some! A great story that makes you think and I haven't read an ending of a book that's given me goose bumps like that since I read 1984. Yeah, I'm favorably comparing his first book to a classic. It was that good!"
5,A rollercoaster ride.,"I don't ride rollercoasters anymore. This book is the closest thing I've experienced in a long time. The ups, downs, twists, turns and wonder of what is coming next. I could not put it down. The characters were so believable, they were real. I could feel their emotions. I could see them. Hopefully, this will be a major motion picture. I wouldn't change a thing. I hope Dr. Jacobson has another book coming out very soon."
5,Fabulous,"False Accusations was a truly riveting novel! I carried it everywhere - to the office, to lunch, to the doctor's office - because I simply couldn't put it down! My TV viewing suffered I couldn't be bothered to watch! I HAD to keep reading! I look forward with great anticipation to Dr. Jacobson's next novel. What a tremendous amount of enjoyment."
5,This book is a 10!,FALSE ACCUSATIONS is the best book I have read in a long time. I stayed up too late reading -- I couldn't put it down. The characters are well-developed and I enjoyed the plot involvement in both medicine and law. Richard North Patterson and John Lescroart are my favorite legal suspense authors. I've just added Alan Jacobson to that list.
5,A fast-paced story that grabs on to you from the first page.,"Once you start reading, you become captivated by the characters, the story, and the emotions. The story unfolds quickly and is easy to follow through the twists and turns of the plot. It's a fast read and you find yourself saying, ""Just one more chapter"" over and over again. It's a story that you can imagine happening in real life."
5,Inspirational,This book is not only a guide how to make beads but it is allso a source of inspiration. When I don't know which bead to make I get this book and all kind of ideas pop up. It's clear and one can easily find the things one is looking for.
2,Not,It was a good thing. to get this for free. it a good thing that I can use it. I would get again. You should try it today or tomorrow
4,Great overview of glass beanmaking.,"Recommended to me by an experienced bead maker as a good book for learning the craft. Covers materials, tools and technique. Great Book and beautiful too. Exactly what I expected it to be."
2,Only for beginners,"Another one of the many basic, beginners beading books coming out. I would recommend a more comprehensive text like Corinna Tettinger's ""Passing the Flame"""
1,Not so good,"Everything in this book has been covered in Cindy Jenkin's book 'Making Glass Beads'. No need to buy it. I am sorry I did, it was a waste of money."
5,"Beadmaking For Beginners, Wish this was on DVD",I love this book when I 1st started out 4yrs ago. I still go back for reference. This is a great book. Back then I wish it was on dvd.
3,Not too bad,"The book is not very essential for me.I prefer ""Beads of Glass"".Anyway it is beneficial that the techniques are told and the photographs of them can be seen in this book.In the book you can upgrade step by step. The book begins with the setting up the studio and ends with the advance techniques. I can say that this book is not efficient for intermediate beaders."
4,Excellent book for starters,"Far from being an expert or even proficient glassworker, I really liked this book. It's comprehensive. It has techniques that the Cindy Jenkins book does not contain and hers was one of the best books on beadmaking I've found. If you can only buy one book (who can?) I would purchase this as a starting manual. If you can buy more, get this and Cindy Jenkins' ""Making Glass Beads."" The two both have the same amount of info on setting up a glassblowing area in your home and advice on torches, etc, but together they make a fine starting point for any aspiring soft glass artisan."
5,A Master at Work,"One does not think of Christoph von Dohnanyi as a Brucknerian but his command of Bruckner's Symphony No. 9 has me thinking otherwise. In particular, his control of the First Movement's ebb-and-flow is positively wonderful--a master at work. In fact, I admire Dohnanyi's version as much as Bruno Walter's legendary account on Sony. Dohnanyi is known for his straight-ahead approach which works with the music of, for example, Dvorak and Richard Strauss, but perhaps not as well with Beethoven. With Bruckner it does work, especially with the Ninth, which in Dohnanyi's hands is a joy and marvel to hear. If you love Bruckner, buy this disc before they all disappear."
3,It does look pretty.,"I was looking for some additional deer for our lawn display and these were the largest I could find. Although the size is acceptable, there is very little animation, and I will have to use cable ties every year to hold it together. I also have had a hard time keeping them from falling over. I finally made some wooden stakes and that seems to be working. I will have to wait to see how the hold up."
4,"Useful, good design",This is your basic changing pad. It is a great size - it fits perfectly on a bureau. The curved sides keep the baby in place.
2,Comfy but last only 4 months,"It's soft and comfortable, but it got torn open after using for just four months. I used it by the sink and the filling started to grow fungus.I guess the lack of durability is due to its soft but very thin outer material. It also stain like what a previous user said. I guess previous users who rate this product highly probably use covers to protect it!???(Note: My first changing pad from other brand was not as comfortable as this one, but it last about 2 years.)"
4,solid diaper changing matt,We've had ours for a few years now and it has taken a beating. We often don't have the cloth cover on it and as a result the kids have torn off the cover revealing the foam padding in spots.
4,"Good changing pad, but can stain.","Comfortable pad with nonslip bottom. The only negative is that it can stain. I tried to remove the stain with soap and water without luck. Other than that, it's great."
3,cannot use for long time,It does serve the purpose however once the baby starts putting on weight it gets harder to carry baby back & forth to the station every time baby pees or poops.
5,Changing table option,"Need to figure a way to 'create' another changing table for baby? This is perfect. My sister used it on a side board like piece of furniture and it was just right. It has just enough of a curved shape to keep rollicking baby ON the surface. It is plastic covered for easy cleaning (though we covered it with nursing blanket and table pads for easier cleaning...nonetheless, it's a smart buy. Think about one for your kitchen counter, or keep one in trunk for when you visit friends since it can also be a nice bedding alternative so little one on-the-road isn't stuck at visits staying seated in their car seat (not good for your little ones!) I don't recommend using the buckle... Unless the chld is at rolling over stage. But make sure you secure the cushion on furniture with either some jimmied tie down or rug padding (rubbery clingy stuff) between the piece and your furniture!"
4,changing pad,This worked well for my granddaughter when she came to visit. The only problem we had was that the pad would slip on the wood sofa table we put it on. We solved the problem by putting a piece of rubber underneath the pad which eliminated the slipping.
4,"works alright, good value","I like this changing pad. It works well, it travels well, and it fits all the standard changing pad covers. It's soft but not squishy, so baby doesn't sink into it, and it has raised edges so it's harder for her to roll around/off. Its cover is made of a material that is easy to sanitize and wipe off should there be any ""accidents"" while the diaper is off. The clips are sturdy and safe and easy to unclip when you need to. Overall, it's just a good, basic changing pad."
4,"works as expected, but you're better off on the carpet","We got one of these for each of our kids as they came along, and the pads really performed well. The kids didn't roll off, the pads contained the occasional er, spill; and the pads never fell off the table. In other words, the product is a great product... it's the kids that are the problem.Our oldest started wiggling a lot during changing around 18 months and we really got worried about her falling off the changing table. She wouldn't fit into our pack and play comfortably either, so we started using the floor. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, You can change a diaper on the floor! Lay out an old schemata towel if you must. If the kid wiggles, she can't fall."
2,rips up almost immediately,"I'm not remarkably picky about these things and we were happy to get this changing pad at such a great price with lots of colored liners to choose from. However, it rips up almost immediately. This may not seem like a big deal - it won't bother the baby if you have a liner on it. Then you realize every time the baby wets the mattress it is soaking into the foam core where you cannot clean it! Next thing you know you have a forever pee-soaked foam thing sitting on the dresser. Yuck. I hate to spend more money on a different one, but we're having our second baby and may have to upgrade."
1,Another useless kit from Fuji !,Fuji for some reason puts out useless kits to make money and this one's no different. ...The case is generic and too big for 2650/A203/A303/A205/A210 etc. The tripod is not useable. The batteries don't hold charge for long. A useless kit and total waste of your time and money (even after rebate or any other offers). Avoid any accessory from Digipower and Fuji kits.Fuji does have a better fitting leather case but its hard to find in stock anywhere. Brand name NiMH batteries are better found at your local store.
4,Very nice kit for the camera,"Very nice, the camera bag have enough space for every thinh you want to put in it. the tripod is good also the charger and the batteries."
4,La Vestale,"A complete version of this rare opera, with three ""bonus tracks"" of the more popular arias sung by different performers.Sound quality has not suffered by age or being a liver performance. Two periods of applause are non distruptive.A good introduction to Spontini's most popular opera."
4,"very pretty colors, enough words per page","I bought this book for my daughter. She likes it. We've read it about ten to fifteen times. Good to learn bear's names, not too short or too long. Good for ages 2-5. My daughter likes ""reading"" it to me. It is thin, I think it is worth about 3 dollars. Colors and illustrations are vibrant and pretty."
3,Ordered for my 6th grader,"The pricing is affordable. I ordered this text to match my 6th grade sons class science book. However, I feel that the book fails to provide detailed information / descriptive texts. I purchased some cheap dvd's to supplement some sections (geography dvd's) and we watched some YouTube videos for the rest."
4,Very useful for reading practice,"Love this toy - I'm teaching my 4 yr old to read/spell and it has been invaluable - it has lots of little picture ""rods"", plenty of letter rods (consonants in blue, vowels in red - great idea- reinforces the importance of vowels) a few blank rods, activity cards(e.g.pick pictures of dog, pig, fox and ask which end the same) and a little dry erase board and pen for writing/drawing practice. They have to create words left to right which reinforces that too. Fun factor? Well,its way more fun than worksheets or dry early readers. All in a self contained package so the pieces can be put away easily."
3,Overhyped book,"This book is overhyped. The ""knowledge"" tidbits are sometimes conflicting with each other. The book does have some common sense knowledge but there are lots of other ways to learn that information in straightforward then to go through the hard read. At the same time, the book is very thin. One could read it in a short amount of time and get the bragging rights to have read this book.Pick your choice."
2,The Truth Hurts!,"First, let me state that I am a blues musician, so I might be a little harsh on my review. That said, I bought this video because of Etta, Albert, Junior, and Buddy. I can definitely say that without these illustrious performers, this video would be zero stars. The Bluesbreakers lived up to their name, sounding like a band on its first night out. I would have been embarrassed to be onstage with them, even though they are great musicians in their own right. The worst part was watching John Mayall squirm around like he was setting the place on fire, when in actuality, he was playing some modest licks at best. In whole, the band couldn't start or stop together, and their job of backing up some of the Blues legends was terrible. Buy it used, if at all!"
1,"Uninspired, pedestrian and anemic","As a musician, I can honestly state that the I'd place the caliber of the performance of John Mayall's back-up musicians right up there with what you can find any weeknight at your nearest open mic. While the other name artists on this DVD do their level-best to elevate the lukewarm atmosphere of this concert, it just isn't enough.The selection of only the most well-known standards, shoved into uninspired and (obviously) un-arranged/unrehearsed performances results in a sloppy, stumbling and sophomoric product."
3,"Always a pleasure, but not always real.","I get a kick out of how Todd's character has developed...he's definitely one of the more 3-dimensional people here, which sure wasn't the case in the High School series! Lots of layers to him - he's a good-hearted screw-up in this one, growing & changing. Miss Dana somewhat - she's fun to have around as someone we LOVE to hate. Suspect she'll be back at some point. Chloe confusing & at this point a bit boring, Liz & Sam don't cut it as a realistic couple...but it's all a blast. This one's not a standout, but it'll hold me until the next."
5,Todd drops out of SVU,"Todd drops out of Sweet Valley University,so that he can have more fun at Frankies,where he works[a bar] Elizabeth has been duped by Finn,Finn has another girlfriend. I love the part where Sam and Finn are at The Red Lion,and Sam dumps a cup of Coffee on Finn[Defending Elizabeth,how chivalious!] Elizabeth and Sam Kiss,and Sam doesn't want their kiss to mean anything. Chloe moves out of her dorm,away from Moira and into a new dorm."
5,I love it!,"Ok, i know alot of people hate todd but i like him but not with liz or dana, just playing it kinda loose. You should read it becuase i think that this new independent todd makes the book more interesting. Also theme seems alot more mature and real in my opinion."
2,Kind of disappointing,"This was not the greatest offering from the series. Most fans will be thrilled with the new and complex character developments, but I suspect there are some of us who would like to see Dana come back, and Jessica start dating again. My chief complaint with this book was that it was a little slow moving. I felt like Laurie John was killing time till she could publish the next edition, one for which she had more enthusiasm. The plot meanders and repeats itself often, and I found this to be distracting. However, if you love Sweet Valley, you will want to read this for sheer continuity alone. Not the best edition, but recommended all the same."
5,Great Item,I ordered this for our new bench and it fit perfectly. It is very well made. The shipping was very fast.You won't go wrong with this bench cover.
4,white knob wind ups collectors,"Well done for this hobby of collections,Good varity of Wind up ""white knob"" toysPrice guide is very helpfullLots of examples of different manufactures"
2,"photocopied 'first edition', thus 'new'","The book I ordered is a photocopied paperback version of the original 1935 edition from oxford university press. Some pages even have the pull or distortion from being removed from the copier too quickly. At $25, it is pretty pricy. It is of the same quality as a Dover book and would be a better addition to a library at a $8-10 price.While I lack Louis R. Velasquez's (other reviewer) experience with emulsions and formulas, i am happy to have the book as a historical reference to mediums and temperas."
5,Small Business Server Easy,"Thanks to Harry's straight forward and plain English explanations, I was able to build configure test and deploy SBS 2003 to my first client with no problems. Client is happy and so am I.Thanks Harry"
2,"Wordy, chatty, grating.","The author clearly does not subscribe to Strunk and White's ""omit needless words"". Perhaps two thirds of the words in this book are needless, and many of them are tediously ""humorous"". The book reads like it was transcribed from an overly long seminar given by someone who likes the sound of his own voice but does not have much to say. This is not the concise, precise text that a small business person needs."
1,1000 Pages should be 250,"Let me give you the example of what he consider's ""Best Practices"" ""BEST PRACTICE: Rumor has it that, in Radmond, this area is called RUP (Ryhmes with pup, like puppy). If you call Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS), you could say RUP and arrr-wuuu-wuuu, but your coworkers who overhear the telephone call might look at you kinda funny""Isn't this hysterical?If you're looking for bad jokes like this, then this is the book for you. It is full of them.I didn't pay almost $60 for this book for this. You can buy mine on Amazon Marketplace.About 1/2 of this book seems to have practical and accurate technical information, but you have to wade through all of this ""cutsie"" filler to get to it. And when you do, you sometimes don't get enough to really understand the issue.I guess it would be ok for a beginner with a bad sense of humor and a lot of time on his/her hands."
4,lovely music,"If you want to have the choir of an English Cathedral on tap, them this series of cds is for you. Whilst Anglican chant does not have the greatness of plain chant from which it derives, it nonetheless has a lovely english charm. It will evoke fond memories of vistis to english cathedrals where the former greatness of England (an England rooted in faith) takes architectural form."
2,Flimsy- Easilly broken,"I bought two of these mirrors for my Polaris Ranger. The first time I got too close to a small branch, one side mirror broke off and is unfixable. There is no mechanism to allow thise mirror to bend out of the way. Even though they were mounted on the roll bar and the mount itslef was loose enough to rotate, the mirror was too weak to withstand even slight pressure.I will mount the remaining mirror inside instead of using it as a sideview. I am trying to find a more substantial mirror to mount as side view mirrors. Mounting this product as shown in the (current) accompanying picture is a recipe for failure unless you ride only where there is no risk of contact."
3,rear view mirror,I found this to be a good looking mirror but alas it was an ill fit for my application so not using it. Be sure of what you need it to fit.
4,Little known gem,"This movie had the misfortune of being released shortly after Dr. Zhivago, and suffered from poor PR and the overwhelming public love affair with Julie Christie. In fact, this is a far better story than Dr. Zhivago, mostly because it is arguably the true story of the murder suicide of crown prince Rudolf of Austria and his mistress, the baroness Maria Vetsera. Omar Sharif is his usual suave self as the crown prince, although a little unconvincing, but the underated and beautiful Catherine Deneuve produces a sympathetic performance as his mistress. the music (particularly the use of the ballet 'spartacus') is stunningly effective."
5,This is THE Eddie Hinton album,"Eddie Hinton, oft referred to as the ""white Otis Redding"", was one of the session musicians who made Muscle Shoals one of the premier recording studios in the 1960s and 1970s, especially for soul music. On his own, Eddie was a mixed bag, suffering from a variety of spiritual maladies that made his live performances and studio recordings quite variable in quality. On this album, you get Eddie at his absolute best. His singing is fantastic as is his guitar work; he's on his home turf at Muscle Shoals, backed by many of his session buddies; the digital remastering by Fred Meyer (don't have a clue as to who he is but I will not forget him) is virtually flawless and beautifully done. Yes, this album is OOP and not cheap but it is THE Eddie Hinton album to own. I consider it to be in the top 20 soul albums of all time."
5,Great book,"I bought this book years ago. I still enjoy it today. It is a fantastic book filled with trivia and tibdits about all the episodes, the cast and characters, and more."
1,I bought a broken one and I have to pay postage to return it,"the pulsator does not work, though the machine can spin when turn the wash choice dial clockwise further. in addition, the water keep coming in the tub, that mean I can choose only one water level: overflow. besides, the bottom keep leaking for the reason I can never find out.Please note: this was the first time I used this machine. It seems I was mailed a broken one.And when I called Haier America customer service, they admitted my brand new washer was broken, but I have to pay postage to return it! Can you image it!!!"
4,Great for the price,"I got my washer three days ago. It took about 10 minutes to set it up, it was already assembled. I was glad because I only own a phillips screwdriver and a hammer. I've washed about five loads of clothes and each came out clean and the machine did such a great job spinning that it took only about an hour to dry. It is so great not to have to go to the laundromat and spend $20/week. This will save me a lot of money and time. The only complaint I have is that during the wash cycle the washer is suppose to stop if the lid is opened, it doesn't do that. I will have to read the manual and see. I have contacted customer service also."
3,I thought it could last longer,it died after almost 4 years(washing is still fine but no spin). We used it 3 time a week. Now I have to buy a new one. Hope the newer model HLP21E can last longer.
3,Toy washer,"Worked fine for a couple of years. Then, when we got a kid, the workload increased dramatically. After a half of a year of crappy performance, the washer died. Turned out that safety brake release arm was designed by an idiot - it breaks in two halves. It does not happen overnight, it bends first, not releasing the brake completely. With brakes half-applied the motor struggles and burns out.Good luck finding replacement XDR-100 motor!Summary, neither do not expect it to work hard, nor to work for more than 3 years. We bought it for $80, so that was a good deal."
3,handy but less reliable,"Bought 1st one in 2004 to wash my baby clothes since I did not want to wash them in common laundry of our apartment.Pro: Just small enough to wash baby clothes or our underwear, and fits bathroom.Con: approaching 1 yr, the washer could not hold water so water kept draining. We warranty exchanged (smooth and prompt). 2nd one is now 2 yrs old. The water drain problem occurs maybe 10% of time so I have to watch the washing cycle (otherwise the water may keep flowing until I stop). Another drawback is that the clothes get entangles easily (like shirts/trousers). Maybe because the drum is small (not Haier's fault). Take off one star per each complaint.Final: recommend it but be careful of water drain."
5,This is exactly the washer I desire.,"I bought this washer about 1 month ago from Amazon. My wife really loves it! Let me tell you how good it is: very convenient to connect with the tap faucet, water and energy efficient, and size compact. It is especailly useful for families with little kids. I used to use public laundry before my baby was born. But you know, public laundry may wash everything from shoes to pet clothes. Babies are not as resistant to infetion as we adults, so I bought this one particularly for my baby. It just works perfectly."
2,poor support,"I can not review the unit because some parts that comewith the unit are missing or damaged. normally customer servicewould ship out replacement parts and problem solved. however, inmy case they do not have my model number (XQBM22-C)listed in theirdatabase so they are unable to order the parts. now i can not usethe washer until someone from corporate headquarters contacts me.If this is an example of the support haier gives their customers,i will not deal with them again.UPDATEReceived part (lint filter) shortly after speaking to headquarters rep. Informed that database for my model had been corrupted and was been restored.I have now used the washer about ten times and have no problemswith it. You must, however, be aware that usage is restricted tolite weight clothes. so forget about jeans."
4,Perfect for Motorhome too,I just bought this amazing litle washer for my 31ft motorhome. It hardly takes any space and hooked up to the kitchen sink in a pinch. Clothes come out very clean and will save me the hassle of driving all my kids to the laudromat while on our travels. Only set back is the caster kit they advertise to move this unit around is extremely difficult to find. I'm still looking for it and have extended my search to Canada. Lowes no longer sells it and Haier has had it on back order for quite some time. Have had no problem with leakage or any other complaints I've read. I really love it. Can't believe how small and efficient it is.
2,Leaves soapy streaks on clothes,If you live in an apartment that lacks the necessary connections for a real washer you can hook this up to your kitchen sink. Unfortunately it can only wash a few items of clothing at a time. The basin inside it is tiny. If you tried to do a decent sized load you would frequently get soapy streaks on the clothes after washing them. At least it was more convenient than going to the laundromat.
5,"Wonderful machine, worth the money",I got it for 2 weeks. It's a wonderful machine. Easy to set up and use. Clean clothes very well. Save water and energy. It's totally worth the money. My wife loves it so much.
2,"Good design, but bad make","In the last year, I bought one, but return it within three days because it could not sink. And then I bought another one, it's always sinking (leaking), and then exchanged one, the third one was also leaking, but not serious. A couple of weeks ago, its warranty would expire, so asked the manufacture to fix the leaking problem. Their service was good, at last they found the problem and got fixed.So two stars."
2,disappointed,"I brought one at Amazon.com. At first, it works very well. but after one week usage, I found it leak water. Sometime the spin function stuck."
1,LEAKS WATER - CUSTOMER SERVICE WORTHLESS!!!!! DO NOT BUY,"This washer is cute, HOWEVER, it leaks water CONSTANTLY balanced or not. And when speaking to customer service they seem to KNOW NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT ""CUT THE CORD AND SEND BACK"". They cannot tell you how to fix the leak or what may be causing it.THEY ARE WORTHLESS. I've CUT THE CORD, and will SNED AGAIN FOR THE THIRD TIME (as it kept coming back). I REALLY JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! BUT OF COURSE, THIS IS A ""RIP OFF"" COMPANY, SO THEY CAN ONLY SEND A REPLACEMENT THAT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO WORK CORRECT EITHER. IT'S BASICALLY A ""HIT & MISS"" with this HAIER COMPANY. I BEGGED THEM TO COME AND GET THIS PIECE OF CRAP AND GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK!...THEY TOOK THE MONEY AND RAN!DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY - DO NOT BUY"
3,Where can I buy the lint filter?,"It is a good machine, but the parts are hard to find. Does any body know where to buy its lint filter?"
1,Do not buy haier product,"I bought this product last year. It worked fine at the begining till one day, the hose on the machine fell apart from the hook by which it was attached to the sink to pour water out. Water kept going out from this poor design machine and flush my apartmnet, and the unit downstairs.I tried to contact with the company, but the contact people said they are not responsible for the flushing. What hell, it was caused by the poor design, but they just said it is not their fault.I strongly suggest not to buy it, but if you have already bought it, check the hook constantly."
5,peerrrfect,"great washer, it does more of a load than u expect it to it wont leak unless u put too much soap!!! it spins the clothes dry! and most of all they are very clean! it's very quite too"
5,Perfect if you have a new born coming,"This washer is everything I needed it to be! We are expecting a newborn baby and living in an apartment this machine is perfect! Easy to use, easy to install, and seems to do the job well. I wouldn't recommend getting this if you are going to give it heavy duty usage. The washer isn't big enough to handle big loads."
4,"not bad for the price, quick shipping","Purchased this item for small loads during the week and was surprized at how well it worked. It worked well and most difficulties were in adjusting to a small machine such as amount of detergent and size of load. It fits nicely in the kitchen closet. Wish it had wheels, but isn't that heavy. The greatest feature is the tune Jingle bells. What teenager wants to have Christmas songs while their friends are visiting. Just a little threat to get the wash done or get embarassed. It gets that job done, the machine that is.Delivery was quick which in this area is great. Found it in my backyard by the kitchen door and used it that day."
2,Nothing Special,"It gets the job done, but is so sensitive and flimsy that the wash load is thrown off balance in EVERY spin cycle. You pretty much have to babysit the machine and rebalance the wet wash every time it tries to spin. That said, over time it's cheaper than wash-and-fold and less of a hassle than going to the laundromat."
2,Washes well but requires baby-sitting and adjustment during cycle,"Pro's:- Lightweight machine is easy to move.- Washes and spins-dry the clothes very well.- Does not get unbalanced easily during spin.Con's:- I cannot get the machine to both fill and drain with the same exhaust hose setup. The exhaust hose has to be UP to fill the machine, and DOWN to drain during the spin cycle.- Machine thus needs to be monitored during the cycle such that I can move the exhaust hose up and down depending on whether it is washing or draining."
5,Great machine. Found caster kit!,Love the machine. Too heavy to move without wheels. Finally found them at www.applesave.com Look under washers. $[...] no shipping and paypal accepted! Haier no longer makes them according to the company.
3,washed great...but now it won't spin,"this machine washes great...actually better than the machines at the neighborhood laundromat. However, it stopped spinning the otherday after only about a month or two of use. We're not sure what it is yet, but we're hoping it is easily fixed. If not, we just threw the money away since I can't find the receipt. In short...keep track of EVERYTHING...just in case."
4,Good Little Machine,I just got the washer today. It works very well. The clothes came out very clean. I was even able to fit couple of full size sheets in it. The only complaint is that I had some difficulty operating the machine for the first time. The user manual is not well written. It left out alot of details on how to use the machine such as when to turn on the faucet. I had to play with the machine before I was able to wash my first load.
1,Order canceled,I tried to purchase this product but the vendor canceled my order without explanation...
3,Disclosure and its meanings,"This book is a disppointing read. The data are old: the epidemic has moved on from pre-HAART days so that the narratives about disclosure are distorted by the time warp. The material isn't organized well either, so that the social patterning of disclosure (e.g. by gender, social class, race etc.) is never revealed. The book needed a better and deeper theoretical analysis to elucidate the connections between social patterning, HIV transmission and disclosure. Further, the material presented here is a little too rosy. Many people do not disclose their HIV-positive status in the short term and often not in the long term either. It was difficult to get a sense of the meaning behind the material in a way that would be useful for dealing with issues of disclosure in the field."
5,"Useful insights, not righteous prescriptions","This book is a welcome respite from the ""damn or defend"" approach usually taken to hot-button issues like HIV disclosure. Rather than inserting themselves as authorities who tell people with HIV what to do, the authors let people who are wrestling with all the complexities of HIV disclosure--with casual partners, with long-term partners, even with parents and friends--speak for themselves . The result is a portrait that won't satisfy those who want to mandate how it is people with HIV who live their lives, but also doesn't pander to people who want to whitewash away the uncomfortable truths about how people infect one other. Many of the voices here capture the complexity that gets lost in sound bites about HIV. This is just how it should be with a book about an issue that is simultaneously so everyday and so freighted with consequence for many of us. Get it. Read it. It will make you feel human, and appreciate the humanity of others."
1,Meh!!!!!!,When i recived this spongebob balloon i was thrilled! It got here before my son bday party when the big day came to blow it up the holle to put the hellium was missing! I could not blow the balloon up and it was the main one!!!! All i had to do with it was taped him on the wall dissapointed!
5,Cute,"I like the size, color and quality of this product. I used this to my sons birthday party. He kept playing and hugging this one. Its good for party. I recommended this to everyone."
5,A perfect compliment to you XBOX 360,"This is another great product from Monster Cable. It hooks up easily and you will have HD component viewing in no time. Attach the fiber optic cable to the 1/8"" connector and the other toslink end to your surround sound system and your set for 5.1 surround audio. The cables are nice and solid and should give you years of use."
1,fooled,"doesnt come with the converter to conect to the jack,thus you cant use the fiber optic cable!!!!!am i the only one that didnt get this or are all the other reviews fake?"
2,BE CAREFUL!!!!!!,"Where as the High Def cables that come with the $399 package have a High Def + Regular TV switch, this one does not. Even if you have component inputs on your TV, which I do as well, if your TV is not High Def it won't work. I had to return them and use the original cables that I would like to say work perfectly fine. They're thick and display a great image and even have a Optical Audio cable input. The Monster Cable is a great product if you have a High Def TV but as far as I'm concerned it is not an improvement over the original. Jack"
3,Track Listing,"This album was originally released in 1994, on the Swiss label, Hall of Sermon. Here's the track listing:1. Hardwired2. Die3. Trial of Tears4. Guilt5. Les Desirs Ardents6. Trust7. Kain Sinn8. Suffer (From Your Birth)9. SenseItem of Note: The liner notes state: ""All noisy and distorted sounds are part of the art and not mistakes of the musicians or engineers."""
1,The discription states 25/ctn: You only get 1 tube.,"As the other reviewer mentions there is nothing wrong with the item that is sent to you. The issues is in the quantity. The description states 25/ctn and I guess that means they can fit 25 tubes in one box... not that you are getting 25 tubes. you only get 1 tube for the same price as multiple other vendors sell packs of 25- customer service told me that it is clearly stated that you will only receive one tube... guess I missed that so perhaps it is indeed my fault, although I would recommend removing the ""25/ctn"" from the description. My mailings which are time sensitive will now go out late as I wait for my tubes and be very costly."
1,A Cruel Joke,"Do not order this!!! You only get one tube for $29.99!! I ordered these and according to the description it says 25/ctn, which a normal person would assume means there are 25 in a carton. I received on large box with only one tube, I called after a few days (thinking they were coming one to a box, which would be a lot of boxes). Nope, according to the Amazon Customer Service Rep I spoke with, 25/ctn is a dimension. What dimension I wonder, as it is an 18"" x 2"" tube. They prompty refunded my money, but the person I spoke with couldn't understand what the problem was. Seriously, $29.99 for ONE TUBE! Who would, in their right mind, be willing to pay that. This is a rip-off, I can't believe they are still listed on Amazon."
2,Poor Mechanical Design,"This bike seems great at first, but whoever designed it clearly didn't ride it before they sold it. The pedals extend too far off the gears, so if you happen to pedal forward and down at the same time as you slightly turn the front wheel, your foot will hit the back end of the wheel. I rode this bike for less than 10 minutes, and it happened multiple times. It's just ridiculous."
2,kind of a piece of garbage,ergonomics person at work just dropped one of these off at my desk... and i can tell from 5 minutes of use that it's a completely useless piece of plastic.WHY they gave me this instead of investing an additional $15 into something nicer is beyond me.
3,"While it is somewhat out-dated, it is still very interesting","This book charts the stadium and minor league baseball developments in 15 cities in the US. The author spends much of his time discussing the inter-workings with the local governments and the minor league teams. Also into consideration is the city planning and community involvement. This book is very interesting if you are interested in the business side of baseball or the inter-workings of government. The book speaks mainly about developements in the 1980s, some of which have changed over the years. An example would be Durham and their lack of a modern stadium, which changed in the mid 1990s. While some data is out-dated, it is still a good source for infomration."
4,Excellent Resource for Local Communities,"When it comes to considering, funding and building minor league baseball stadiums, economic development agencies and local governments don't need to reinvent the wheel. This book outlines the experiences of other communities in relatively useful detail. Learn from their experiences and establish a workable platform from which to build your own approach to funding and building (or perhaps deciding not to build) a minor league park in your community."
4,Sweet treat,"I love to try foreign candies and this one doesn't disappoint. It brings to mind those strawberry wrapper candies with the gel in the center. I forget the name since I've never seen them in a package. Although they are colorless they are quite flavorful. After a moment you'll reach the sweet jam like center which is just as good as the outer candy. Since I was trying these for the first time I didn't want to go with a 6 pack, but since I like them it's all well and good."
4,Lovely,Very pretty in the candy dish at the holidays and nice fresh taste to the fruit fillings. Everyone liked these. Much better than other brands I've tried.
5,book of great insight and depth,"I just read the negative review as well and it inspired me to add my 2-cents worth, so to speak. I found the book to be very engaging and while some it of had some tragic, difficult parts, I still found the overall quality of the book to be substantial and well written. It was full of aspects that rang true to much of my experience growing up in a large city and my fascination with human nature's self destructiveness and redemption qualities and the overall learning process along the way. I have a great respect for the author and I am interested to find out the title of the casette tape of the chain gang music the Susie was moved by at the end of the book. I look forward to reading the next book!~"
4,A very intelligent read..,"Quite captivating, though written with the rhetorician in mind (lots of big words!). The journey through relationships, drugs, and a lost soul climbing her `metaphysical Tibet' is portrayed by the author in a manner that is simply enthralling. I began the book not really knowing where it would take me - and having now completed the journey, will re-read it (with a highlighter pen) so I can re-visit some truly engaging moments."
3,"Memorable, but...","Each time I put this book down, I wondered if I would bother to pick it up again. I did finish it, however, and was pleasantly surprised at the ending ...The main character's struggle with drug addiction and other dysfunctional behaviors is depressing, for sure. The author seems to stop just short of outright shocking the reader, while still managing to build some sympathy for each of the female characters. I kept reading out of the urge to eavesdrop on this somewhat generic terrible life to see just how bad it could get. Thankfully, at the end the characters became ""real"" to me, rather than puppets acting out a sad tale of the destruction ofaddiction.Given the subject matter, however, perhaps thisdichotomy is just what the author intended. In which case, this booksucceeds."
2,"Ugly tale, dumb sex scenes, but some great heroin OD details","For a book that starts out so powerfully with a detailed, gross yet frightening heroin OD scene, it certainly becomes a great disappointment halfway through. A roommate who's too good to be true, parents who were (deep, dark secret) too _fat_, a token AIDS death, graphic sex scenes that are not erotic, lots of loser drug-addicts with no motivation provided for being thus, and finally a forced bit of hope that has nothing to do with the rest of the story.Worth picking up and reading the opening scene while standing in the bookstore, otherwise, not worth the price."
2,"Pretentious, overwritten tripe","This narrator, for all her erudition and self-professed intelligence, has virtually no sense of irony, is pedantic, self-involved and wholly unlikeable. I lost all interest in her all-too predictable fate after about page 50. A few scenes, the cucumber one among them, stayed with me, but, let me hasten to add, NOT in a good way."
1,Reading this begged a question: How bad is bad?,"I cannot imagine what would possess someone to give this book five stars, or even three. It was awful."
1,disappointing Kind Of Love,"I'd not seen this movie before, but being a HUGE fan of Newman+Woodward, thought it worth the gamble of buying it ... sadly, I was horribly disappointed with the movie ... the only good thing about the whole thing is watching the Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward acting together, knowing they were a couple in real life. What a load of twaddle is this movie!@*! But then again, to each their own."
4,CUTE CUTE MOVIE,"I'm in love with Paul Newman so this might sound a little biased. It is such an adorable movie. My boyfriend and I laughed so many times and it is just a cute, fun movie with a nice man to look at while watching. I LOVE YOU PAUL!!!!"
2,Ho-Hum Worst Paul Newman movie I have seen,"I made the mistake of buying this movie before I had ever seen it. I like the actors in the movie. But that is as far as it goes. Very slow moving, pretty much boring movie. I stopped watching about 35 minutes in. My suggestion is don't buy it unless you already know you like it. I couldn't hang with it."
3,The great one in a weak one...,"This is not one of his best films but he did get to work with his wife and that must have been fun ! I really would say to watch Long hot summer, now that is great interaction between he and Liz Taylor."
5,Impresionant transylvania,"I was very impresionated about this book, very romantic and cruel, it show the end of the golden age of transylvania with the conjuration of nobilty again Banfi , a very pride but intelligent nobleman who ruled in her luxurious castle in Bontida. I like too the passages about theturkish girl who lived in caves with her tiger, and the love of the wife of Banfi for his husband... but I don't want to tell more. Should be better to read this about Transylvania that Baran Stoker is sure because the really history of Transylvania is more more interesting than the invention. AAnd this is a really history told in a wery dynamic captivating metter."
4,The Hides is a good horror story,The Hides was a good horror story but like many others the story could probably have been shortened some. I do like the Timmy Quinn stories and will read more. The author uses words with syle and creativity but sometimes gets a little too wordy.
5,Wonderful,One good book after another. I wish I would have come across this author a long time ago. Next please !
4,Liked it but had some slow parts.,This is the second book in the series about Timmy Quinn. I love the mystery surrounding his new found gift. I had hoped to find out more about how he got it and the purpose of it in this book but maybe that is to come in the series.
2,Throw it back,"Sure I could listen to this but why would I when I could put in Live at Leeds? All talk, no walk kitschy cheeze. I'd rather listen to Poison."
3,A lot of wasted content and no extras.....,"With a run time of just over 61 minutes a lot of time has been wasted on content that just isnt even remotely funny. What possessed them to include 4 ""songs"" by the George W. Bush Singers ?These ""songs"" are embarrassing and merely consist of repeating what has already been stated elsewhere on the DVD. Worst of all they take up over 11 and half minutes that should have been spent on more Bushisms ! And to top it off, at the end of the program more space is wasted, 3 minutes, on a David Letterman style Top Ten ""Bushisms"", that isnt funny and once again repeating what we've already seen. Jacob Weisberg has published 4 books on ""Bushisms"", surely there's more than enough content to fill a DVD without having to resort to banal filler material ?"
3,Started falling apart,Warm sleeping bag - NOT good for tent camping since it's very large and heavy. The zippers (sewed seams) are coming apart.
5,Quality and Function are Outstanding,"Bought this as a gift for my son who has a Glock 26 that he wants to carry concealed. Galco quality is consistent and exceptional. Break-in of the holster only took a day and then the fit was perfect, snug and reliable but not too tight. Would recommend this product without reservation. It was helpful to read prior reviews that talked about break-in being done by putting pistol in holster covered with two or three plastic shopping bags for several hours to help with the stretching of the leather. That was very helpful."
2,Don't get this washing machine,"I have had this for 1 1/2 years, and the whole time I wished that I had spent more to get a decent machine.... It makes a lot of noise, and now it will not work. I get an Error #2 which means that the door is not closed properly, yet it is closed properly. After further examination I have discovered that the circuit board for the unit is faulty. The replacement price for the board: $338!!! How is it that they can get away with charging $40 more for the circuit board than the entire unit cost originally? And, Haier technical support leaves something to be desired. You call in a problem and speak to someone who opens up a pdf of the product manual. If they can't figure it out, they take your phone number and say someone from techical support will call you ""in about 2 business days. I should have rated this product 1 star...."
2,Horrendous,"This washer does a poor job of water control. The machine will constantly add water throughout the wash. It just wastes too much water in only 1 wash. For anyone who does not want a high water bill please stay away from this!!!! The only good thing about this product is that on the spin cycle this washer can get your clothes really dry compared to another washers. However, regardless Please stay away from this!"
2,Bad shipping services...returning the product,Haven't got a chance to use it. The product has been damaged badly during the shipment process(Not sure it happened in China to US or Amazon to my home).
4,"Great service, price; fast delivery","This machine was a little difficult to assemble exactly according to directions, but we were able to get it together and working well in a couple of hours. There seems to be a slight leak in back because we haven't been able to properly level our unit. Still, it works very well, runs quietly, arrived quickly (without any big dents!), and was less expensive than simpler models sold in local stores. We are very pleased."
4,about my washer ...,I received my washer yesterday --came in perfect condition..took only 10-15 minutes to set-it up. Ran a wash right away...Its whisper quiet ..and the drum is a decent size for a compact. I live on the 2nd floor in a condo and this unit hardly makes a noise when its spinning --so I think I will be happy with my purchase..:)
1,"Dented, crushed, adn missing parts!!!!","Although Amazon was not hesitant to give me my money back, I was upset that after my first shipment was replaced , the second also came severely damaged. The front was scrayched and the bottom had obviously been dropped or bumped. Also, it was missing two casters.I really would have loved the machine if it had come undamaged.....But it seems that it was just not possible. Then I asked Amazon to please send me another and they refused."
4,very good washer,"My washer arrived with a dent on the side panel. But contrary to what observed by one reviewer, the dent is inward. So it could not be the washer parts that caused the damage. Anyway the dent has not concerned me much. I did saw a plastic part fall to the ground when I took the washer out of tht box but it turned out to be what's used to fasten the washer inside the box. So no problem here.It took me a while to figure out how to connect it to my faucet. I had to first remove a metal mesh filter from the faucet using pliers. After that the connection went smoothly and the washer has been working great in the past two months or so."
3,Nice Washer...bad service and delivery,"My wife and I live in a very small apartment. We worked out that buying this washer would pay for itself in less than six months in savings from the laundry mat. We had a bad experience getting it shipped to us(quite a few dents and bad customer service from FED EX). We also had a problem that the door to the washer wasn't attached. I called customer service and they said I would have to send it back for repairs. I would be required to pay shipping and a $15 fee. I had an engineering friend come over. We fixed it in less than a few mintues. It was a very minor problem that required little to no effort to fix. The company's representative knew next to nothing about this product. After these initial hurdles, the washer works fantastically with few to no problems. I highly advise this product, but only if it comes in good working order upon delivery. The Haier corporation has absolutely nothing to offer in the realm of customer service or technical expertise."
2,dents,the washer was deliverd twice both times had to be returned due to dents in the machine their was no third ordered i was very disapponted it was a gift
1,buy something else...,I bought this washing machine for my mother who lives in a small apartment. After waiting 6 weeks for delivery the 1st machine that was delivered leaked water all over the motor and had dings & dents on it. She returned it with no problems and had it replaced with the same model. The 2nd delivery arrived yesterday and this one was caved in on 2 sides. Apparently the packaging is not sturdy enough.
2,excessive damage,"I had just received the washer so I haven't used it yet. I will not be ordering anything else due to excessive damage on the machine, from the shipping. It looks like it has a corner at the very front and the side looks pushed in, thats not including the dotted look towards the bottom. Yes I did contact them and on the second washer had worse damage than the first, to think someone will pay out any kind of money and be satisfied on damage. I got a good deal so the one that looked like it went to the pinyata before coming to me. I am now using the party one and it works fine. I learned to check the drain hose before using it. It is a lifesaver living in apt and no hookups and kids. I have recconmend it to some of my friends told them don't expect it to look perfect."
4,It works beautifully,"I don't have problems that other people complained: manual is too confusing to follow. I did it pretty well.But the cover was out of its place when I opened the case. Later on I managed to put it back. The machine works very well, low noise, washed clean, potable, water pumped into the sink, multi-adaptor to connect input-hose. But be aware you have to put the drainage pipe high (to a sink level) although you have a low level drainage hose, because if you leave the pipe low, the machine will never fill water to full as the water keeps flowing out.Overall, it works well. I recomend it.Amazon.com has a quick and good custom service. When I reported that the machine cover was out of place, immediately they shipped another one to me, which still sits in my room, hoping somebody will come to pick it up soon."
2,Disappointed,"We are disappointed with this washing machine.One of the bottom corners was bent when we received the machine and the supplied water pipes leak water. The user has to install a panel at the bottom of the machine to seal off the noise from the motor. The panel was poorly designed and when installed, leaves big gaps all around.You supposedly could hook up this portable machine's hot and cold water pipes to any single faucet. But Haier was so stingy that it didn't even supply a $3 ""Y"" connector for doing this. This defeats the whole purpose of a ""portable"", which is the reason we bought it to supplement our full size machine in the first place."
1,defective machine,"when I received this machine, I couldn't believe my eyes.It's steel cover has one obvious bump; only 4 of the 8 screwes of the bottom cover could be fixed; most importantly, the inside tub is off-center, the high speed roation obviously will damage the engine. We even dare not to try to use this machine.Haier in china is a famous brand, don't understand why its branch in america produce such a shabby machine. What's more, we contaced the support line of Haier, they said they will come to have a look, but in fact never, delay and delay again.this is the worst shopping experience I ever have in America!!!"
1,"Well, there's SOME good news","The great news is that the shipping and purchasing was easy. The return was easy as well. The bad news is that we never got to use our washer because we got the E2 error and when the repairman came to try fixing it, he determined that the machine was not worth repairing due to extensive and non obvious cracking of the cabinet and top. According to him the transmission was also jammed, so even if we hadn't gotten the E2 error the machine would have failed."
5,incredible machine!,"Easy to install, small, efficient, quiet and washes better than my laundry facility washers. I noticed they aren't carrying it right now...too bad because for a condo it's perfect!"
4,No Problems-Highly Recommend this Machine,"After reading through many of the previous reviews I was hesitant to purchase this unit for our mountain cabin. I truly expected a huge, dented, disaster! The unit was delivered quickly and the box appeared to be in good condition. The machine was well packaged with a styrofoam base that appears to prevent the wash tub from swinging during transport. I guess they made changes to their packaging. I found no dents or scratches to the exterior of the machine. Removing the original feet and replacing the casters was not a problem, but do that first, before you screw on the ""noise reduction"" panel to the bottom of the unit. Hooking up the hoses was no problem. I ran a small load and had no leaks or malfuntions. I would recommend this unit to anyone. I'm looking forward to using it up at our cabin, instead of lugging dirty laundry back home with us. I only wish that Haier made a portable clothes dryer that used a standard electrical outlet!"
4,Tired of Paying the Fluf and Fold Laundry Service,"Lot's of wash cycles, and handles my hand washables as well as heavy Lucky Jeans. Easy to roll around and hide in my apartment. Pricey but worth it."
3,OK Golden Age mystery,"PLOT:Fleeing Europe just as WWII ends, a group of people board a Portuguese steamer headed to Buenos Aires. During a violent storm the 5 passengers and three of the crew abandon ship and wind up in a lifeboat on the open Atlantic. After rescue by an American hospital ship headed for America, it is discovered that one of the 8 survivors is dead, and not by natural causes. Once on board the USHS Magnolia, another of the group is murdered and it appears that others of the 6 left are being targeted, too.Review:An okay example of the golden age mystery, interesting because it is set aboard a hospital ship underway, not an often used setting. The writing is fluid and easy to read. The puzzle is fairly presented, although the love-angle was a little too pat, and tended to give away some of what was coming. The solution also proved a little convoluted and depended on a coincidence that was sort of a stretch."
2,Great Idea/Bad Offerings,I saw this on the shelf at a local record store and quickly grabbed it after seeing that it contained 999-Homicide among other rare bands on this DVD.I was under the impression that the footage here would be original and or promo videos for the songs mentioned on the disc.The performance of Homicide by 999 was from 1995 and not one from the early 80's when it was released. At least the Johnny Thunders performance is from the late 70's.Nowhere on this disc does it tell you the source or credits for the clips shown.It ouwld have been nice to know that the stooges performance from from a year ago. and not in their heyday.LAME
4,great novelty gift...,"In our group each of us is a western character from the past. At Christmas we gave each other gifts. I had selected the person in our group who was named ""Annie Oakley"". This item was perfect. My friend as thrilled. I was so glad I was able to find it on Amazon because the gift was great and so was the service."
1,Doesn't deliver on my HUGE expectations,"While I feel that Mr. Mohamadi has made a valiant attempt to gather this enormous quantity of material into one comprehensive, girthy volume, it does fall, shall we say, limp in certain respects.First of all, the author fails to come through in the clutch, and deliver the vital information necessary to successfully apply for and receive a fellowship. It's almost as though the author himself HAS NEVER APPLIED FOR A FELLOWSHIP!Second, the book seems very hastily written. I don't think the author took more than two weeks to write the entire book if you asked me. He probably wrote it during his winter break from college.Finally, I take extreme offense at Mr. Mohamadi's leaving the Jacob K. Javits Fellowship out of the ""prestigious"" category of fellowships. What, $15,000 plus tuition for 4 years ain't good enough for you! Show me the money!If I ever meet Mr. Mohamadi, I'll be sure to give him a piece of my mind about his book."
3,It's OK,"This bike rack is OK. I feel a little uneasy using it for two bikes as it feels a bit flimsy.I wish it had some sort of holders for bike frames (The way it is made the holder is just a metal pipe). Also, I think the tie is too short to secure TWO bikes (one is OK) I would use additional ties to carry two bikes."
4,Basic but effective,"I was looking for a cheap but sturdy and easy to use trunk mounted bike rack and this one was great. It's a great value. It easily holds our two bikes and when properly installed on the car shifts very little (some shift is due to the give of the foam interfaces). I have driven with it on the interstate up to 75 miles per hour. It is important to note that the rack will shift more if the bottom strap (leading to under the bumper or under the hatch) is not pulled tight enough to distend the elastic section.I recommend being careful when installing the rack as the hooks are metal and may damage the finish of the car. However, I have had no damage to mine as of yet by taking care not to allow the hooks to bang or drag across my car. If you are worried about it anyway, you might add a little rubber or foam padding to the hooks.All in all, this is a great basic bike rack. Not bad at all for under $40."
3,"shipping fast, quality is okay",the design is a kind of too simple. installing bikes is not very easy step and may not be safe for highway usage. the two clips which interface with the car trunk should be made of non-metal material otherwise it may damage the car trunk after a long time. be cautious when you close the trunk!
5,a correction to the Amazon.com review,"One Amazon.com review incorrectly calls CeDell Davis a ""Mississippian."" Cedell is a native of Arkansas. He was born in Arkansas Delta boom town of Helena on June 9, 1927. He has since settled in another Arkansas Delta town, Pine Bluff. CeDell's unique ""out of tune"" style that he creates by playing slide with a knife is done out of necessity. When CeDell was nine he contracted polio and lost the use of his right hand. This album was CeDell's first. He has been recorded by Jim O'Neil of Rooster blues records for an Arkansas anthology, _Keep it to Yourself_. CeDell's latest album from Fat Possum, _The Horror of It All_, is in a similar vein as this reissue."
4,Pretty Good,Solid effort from Without Grief after releasing a stellar debut album. Still very melodic with some unique rhythms. Not as good as their first but still commendable and still better than most MDM bands.
1,Don't Bother,"Read the reviews above... I had the same experience. It did NOT work with SOCOM 2. Thanks for nothing, Talk Net."
1,Logitech USB Headset is better than this,"Perfect for use with ""SOCOM""... No No No... only if you play the game on the internet It didn't work with my ""SOCOM II"" either it looks nice but I have no use for it at all... Pay the extra ten bucks for the Logitech USB Headset"
3,Hiking in Shenandoah National Park,"We like to have several books to cross-reference hikes. This one contained some nice, short loop hikes we enjoyed, and longer hikes as well."
2,Not so great,I ordered this book but returned it as it was easy to use and not nice to look at. It just did not inspire me
5,Positional Release,I am a physical therapist and purchased this DVD to enhance my manual skills. Diane does an excellent job of instruction. I highly recommend this DVD. The explanations are great and the techniques are clearly performed. It is very easy to follow and allows you to implement the techniques immediately. I have just recently purchase the DVD but have used the techniques on several patients and have gotten excellent results.
1,Looks good.,It looks good but failed within days. The display had a short using the batteries. Why not use an ac adapter you ask? Because it is NOT included but for an additional $25 or so you can get one making this a $41 corded phone. We went to K Mart and got a wireless phone that is way better and includes the ac adapter for $15. Avoid this phone!
1,dont buy this phone,"this phone makes a constant high static shrieking noise. i bought this phone to use on a regularly scheduled long conference call, and was totally unable to use it. it's going directly in the trash."
1,Don't waste your money,My son was born early so my husband had to run out and get this pump for me while I was in the hospital. It was horrible. It was not comfortable at all. I know it's not supposed to be the most pleasant experience but this was ridiculous. Even the nurses in the hospital told me that it was a horrible pump. Save your money and rent a Mastella (spelling?).
2,Stopped Pumping After A Few Uses,"I received this breast pump as a gift, and I wish I had returned it to the store. I used it for nipple stimulation while I was pregnant (to bring on contractions), and it worked for that, but the first time I pumped after my milk came in, this thing completely broke! The flap didn't open, which caused milk to be sucked into the motor. Now, the motor runs, but there is no suction! I'll be going to get a manual pump instead."
1,Waste of money,"Got this pump for my first pregnancy. Worst product out there. It was very uncomfortable and hurt and began to not work when I became engorged. Best thing I did was rent a Medela Lactina SelectMedela Lactina Select Hospital Grade Breast Pump - BPA Free #016SC01, and bought a double pumping kit,Lactina Double Pump - System Kit ONLYwhich you can get from the hospital. Works wonders an is incredibly comfortable."
2,short life,"despite not pumping on any kind of regular basis, this pump burned out on me within a month. i got about 10 uses out of it before the motor burned out. don't bother to buy it..."
1,It's the worst breast pump!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy this pump, I recently bought this pump and had absolutely no suction, it was a waste of money ($45), I would rather pay $20 more and go for the Medela electric pump for $65."
4,WORKS & FEELS GREAT,"I BOUGHT THIS PUMP AFTER MY NIPPLES BECAME CRACKED & STARTED TO BLEED DUE TO MY DAUGHTER'S AGRESSIVE NURSING (SHE CHEWS!!).I TRIED A MANUAL PUMP & AN AUTOMATIC DOUBLE PUMP, BOTH WORKED POORLY. THIS PUMP HAS A PLIABLE SHEILD THAT CREATES A GOOD SEAL WITH THE BREAST. THE AUTO RELEASE SUCTION IS SO CONVENIENT, OTHER MORE EXPENSIVE PUMPS HAVE TO BE MANUALLY RELEASED. WHY BUY A NAME (MEDELA) WHEN YOU GET CAN A BETTER PRODUCT FROM A REPUTABLE COMPANY LIKE FIRST YEARS? OTHER REVIEWERS SAID THIS PUMP HURTS BUT THEY OBVIOUSLY DID NOT USE IT CORRECTLY. THE BATTERY POWERED OPTION EVEN ALLOWS ME TO PUMP ON THE GO (LIKE IN THE CAR WHILE MY HUBBY DRIVES, DARK TINT HELPS :)) I LOVE THIS PUMP I CAN PUMP 4-6OZ IN ABOUT 15MIN."
1,Broke in 1 month,I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this pump. It worked fine for a month then the motor burned out. I called the manufacturer and I am still waiting for a replacement. Spend the extra money and buy a Medela. It was not worth the savings.
2,I went right back to the Avent.,"I had been using an Avent manual pump for nine months when I decided to go the ""electric"" route to save time. This pump sent me right back to the Avent. It took me an hour to obtain 5 ounces of breastmilk (With the Avent, I was able to pump 10 ounces in 30 minutes). Although you can control the amount of suction used, you cannot control the speed of the ""suckling"" and the massage action of this pump is minimal compared to the Avent. This one is also a little hard on the nipple."
1,THIS IS A BAD PUMP,"I bought this pump because of the price and thinking a battery/electric pump would be great for me seeing that I am a working mother. It started out great I was getting the milk out quick and easy, but after using it for only a month it went bad. The pump always got clogged and I had to stop pumping release my breast from the pump and twist the bottle in order for the milk to go into the bottle. When I opened the motor milk had rotted in the pump resulting in the motor breaking. I now have a manual one and I wish I never bought this pump because a manual one in 100 times better."
1,The worst pump ever!!!!!!!,"This is the worst pump ever. The blue plastic ring inside the suction part continually falls out and it's a pain the place back. It's loud, flimsy, and on the verge of falling apart after one month of use. If you're planning on returning to work and time is of the essence DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!!!!!!"
1,Not for Working Moms,"I really liked that this pump was designed by doctors and had a soft breast cup attachment. It is small, lightweight, easy to assemble, take along and clean HOWEVER......The suction is NOTHING like it described. It is OK for occassional use, but not if you're returning to work. It is too slow and painful.My suggestion is to spend the extra money on a good Medela pump- it will save you time and money- which are worth more than anything to a working mom."
1,Very Unhappy Mother-WASTE OF MONEY,I registerd for this pump b/c of the great price. I had my baby in January. In Febraury I began using the pump and then after a 2 weeks there was no suction. I sent it back to First Years and they sent me a new one. I used the second one three times and there was no suction. I later bought a a better pump. If I had known this was such a horrible pump I would have never registerd for it. IT'S A WASTE OF MONEY!!!
1,Next to nothing suction...,"If I had to do over again I would have bought something else. After a few uses it would stop releasing the suction and I'd have to turn it off and back on again at a lower suction level to get it to release. Also, the suction was okay for the first few times, but now it doesn't work well at all. 20 minutes of pumping and I only get about 1 - 2 ounces out of it. The couple times I got more than that was when I was REALLY engorged. Don't waste your money. Buy a better pump."
1,"Slow, Noisy - Don't waste your $",This pump takes forever express any milk!<br />I was completely engorged & it still took over 45 min to pump 1 oz.!<br />Try the Medela Harmony manual pump instead. It works 100 X better than this piece of junk!
1,Horrible Pump,"This pump worked really well, for about a month. Then it just stopped working right at all. What a piece of junk. I can't believe I paid $40 for it. I can't believe I didn't read the reviews on it before buying it. Never again."
3,Only works with user help,"I bought this pump when I had my second child. I used it only at work 2-3 times or less 5 days a week for about six months. And for my third child for 1 month before it lost all suction power. It was great for the first week I used it on the suction end of things but day by day got less and less suction. It never expressed milk for me unless I was either massaging my breasts or using hand expression technics while pumping. It took alot of time to get even 2 oz of milk because the motor starts to wear out very soon after the first use which disappointed me. I didnt expect it to last forever, but atleast a year of fulltime use would be nice. It may be good for occasional use, but I wouldnt recommend it for everyday use."
2,its an okay pump,"I bought this pump when I had latch on problems and my milk wasnt coming in. The doctors recommended I get a breast pump to help establish my milk. I looked at all the pumps and wound up buying this one because it was more affordable. I used it for two weeks and just gave up and bought the Medela Pump In Style which was VERY expensive because I felt it just wasnt doing the job. After using the Pump In Style, I got a noticible amount of milk the first week I used it. This pump, I thought, was more comfortable than my Pump In Style but it seems it can only be used for occasional pumping."
2,pump needs more pump-less noise,"it works okay, but it doesn't keep a good suction on the breast all the time. the valve gets clogged too easy and the motor is LOUD. i can imagine what my co-workers must think when they walk past mt office and hear it!"
1,The Natural Comfort Pump/ Don't buy it,"This is the worst pump I have ever used. It did not pump properly, it would take me 10-15 minutes to get 1-2 oz with the product on high. Also it made me very sore. If you want a pump in this price range buy the Evenflo Comfort Select. I also used the Medela single deluxe Battery/electric pump. The Evenflo and Medela worked similarly, the medela was a bit smoother.I am disappointed that Babyrus even offers this product. They are supposed to be the specialty store in baby products, and they are selling such a bad product."
4,GREAT AND INEXPENSIVE BREAST PUMP,"I used this pump after my husband went out and bought it for me. When I found out how much he spent on it, I thought to myself ""this pump is gonna stink...you get what you pay for"" Boy, was I WRONG. This pump was great. It provided varying amounts of suction to provide just the right amount that you required. It was quick, simple and VERY easy to use...included a AC adapter which I found provided more power than the battiers did. I only wish that it came with more bottles."
1,Don't waste your money!,This product is terrible. The motor died after one month. My nipples were terribly sore after every use. It took much too long to express the milk. I ALMOST GAVE UP ON BREASTFEEDING BECAUSE OF THIS PRODUCT. Buy or rent the Ameda Purely Yours breastpump. It is a superior product.
1,Don't waste your money!!!!,"I bought this pump when my daughter was 6 weeks old. By the time she was 12 weeks old, it had already stopped suctioning. I only used it for the occasional pumping. I wouldn't waste my money on this!! When I called their costomer service number they tried to tell me that it was no longer under warranty, which is a bunch of crap! I had it well under the 90 days but they said that it is only covered for 30 days. It is a total waste of money!!!! I hope that someone can learn from my mistake. I wouldn't even give it one star. I wish I could have given it no stars!!!!!"
1,A huge waste of money!,"I bought this pump because I recently had my first baby. I was never able to get more than 2oz. at a time and I was lucky if I got that. I tried to use it for 2 months before I got so irritated with it that I just gave up. Anyone considering this product should either buy a more expensive one, or see about renting one from their local hospital. This pump is a HUGE waste of time and money!"
1,Do Not Buy This Pump!,"This pump caused me to have a lot of pain not to mention bleeding. It took five min. to get one oz and half of it was blood. Even my lactation nurse told me that this pump was no good. If you need and electirc pump I think you should save your money and buy the pump in stlye or rent one from the hospital. If you don't need to pump often, buy the Avent manual pump. It works well. Although it is a pain if you have to pump on a regular basis."
1,this item is JUNK and THE 1st YEARS WILL NOT REPLACE OR REPAIR!!!,"I purchased this pump for the occasional use. I am a stay at home mom but wanted the freedom to go out for more than 2 hours every once in a while. After using this pump 15-20 times over several months, milk started leaking through the battery chamber. It lost all suction after that happened. I called the First Years to send me replacement parts or a replacement pump and they told me that it was beyond its 90 day warranty. THEY WILL NOT BACK THEIR PRODUCT EVEN IF THERE IS A FACTORY DEFECT!! I am very dissapointed in the company as well as this pump!! I will not purchase anything else made by the 1st years (if I can help it), and I HOPE THAT THEY DONT GET OVER ON YOU TOO! ***What a waste of money***"
1,Waste of money!!!!,"I bought this pump the end of July when I went back to work. It worked wonderfully for about a month and then I didn't touch it over the holiday weekend and Tuesday back at work it was worthless. I was leaking everywhere at work and there was nothing I could do about it. I sat at work all day engorged and in pain because this worthless pump just stopped after about 5 weeks of use. If you are considering this pump DON""T BUY IT!!! It will be the biggest waste of $40, I really should have read the reviews!"
2,For occasional use only,"I got this pump after having tried the the Advent ISIS thinking it would pump faster and more.. the ISIS was a joke, i could manually express more milk that that pump.. I thought this one would be better since it was electric and at first it was okay. but after about 3 weeks, the motor sounded as though it was going out and the amount of milk pumped wasn't enough. there isn't enough time in the day to nurse my son AND pump enough milk for when i go back to work. I'm definately going to look into getting either a Medela or just renting one."
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY~AWFUL PUMP!,"I purchased this pump to use for an occasional relief of engorgement since my daughter is strictly breastfed. (I had been using the Medela Pump in Style that I had borrowed from my friend but had to return b/c she had her baby) Well, I got an occasional use all right....1 TIME!!!! I used it once w/out any problems. The 2nd time, the milk backed up into the unit. I cleaned it all out and now it sounds like it's sucking but it isn't. Very frustrated!!I thought I'd buy this one b/c the price was right for the amount of times I'd use it. If you ask me, I don't think 1 time is worth the money I spent. I would NOT recommend this breast pump to anyone."
1,WORKED GREAT FOR AWHILE THEN JUST WENT BAD,"I bought this pump because of the price and I thought an electric and battery operated pump would be the best to use because I would not have to do it manually. It worked out great the first month I used it, but when I started to pump more it started to mess up. The pump always got clogged and it caused a lot of problems with pumping out the milk."
1,This pump does not work,"I registered for this breast pump because of the on-line reviews claiming it to be comfortable and inexpensive. I recieved it at a shower and was thrilled. I took it out of the package and had it ready to go in my bag for the hospital (in case I needed to pump there). At the hospital, my lactation consultant said that none of her patients have ever had luck with this breast pump and if I did, come back and let her know. Well, 4 days later, I was home, completely engorged, my baby could not latch on, and the pump simply did not work. I tried for at least 30 minutes on each side and maybe got one drop. To top it off, it hurt. I had to go to the local babies r us store and buy another pump. Although the repalcement pump was about 40 dollars more, it was well worth it because it worked. It is now, my new best friend, Medela. The good news about the faulty pump is that the company did take it back."
1,Difficult to use,"I bought this breast pump after having my second child. I was able to borrow a Medela breast pump with my first child, but had to buy one of my own after my second. I chose this one because of the price. It is very difficult to maintain a proper seal to get proper suction. I knew I had plenty of milk to pump out, but this product could not seem to get at it. I was able to borrow another friend's Medela pump and had no problems, so I definitely knew the problem was THIS breast pump. My advise-- spend the extra money and get a Medela."
1,Horrible Product!!,This pump is a huge waste of money! It has poor suction and takes an extremely long time to express milk. I tried to use this pump a handful of times and could never get more than an ounce of milk. I recommend the Avent Isis.
1,Terrible Pump,"This is the second First Years pump I bought. I will never buy anything from this company again. The first pump lost suction and I am still waiting on replacement parts for that one, thankfully we bought the warranty from Babies r Us so that is being sent in as soon as the 90 days are up. I bought this pump since the price was right and knew I wouldnt be using it long. It can be painful, it does not mimic the sucking of a baby nursing, it is more like the machine they use to milk cows. Plus since you dont have a steady suction you lose your milk supply."
5,the name goes with the product,"i am a first time mother, i was always told by my friends that breast pumps were horrible. but i decided to breast feed so i wanted a pump that was easy to assemble and gentle. and i got that and more. you choose how hard you want the pump to suction.(my son sucks my nipples harder than the pump)and its easy to clean and assemble. it even has its own case..i highly recommend this product.."
2,Don't Bother,This pump was given to me as a gift. I had been using a hospital grade pump for a while because my baby was a preemie. She has since helped me to establish a good supply and I would use the hospital grade pump after each feeding & would get a good amount of milk in no time. This pump doesn't compare. I will be purchasing another pump.
1,Dont waste your money,I purchased this pump after the one I originally had stopped working. I am very disappointed with it. I have a good milk supply established and have been pumping since my baby was born but I was unable to get any milk at all with this pump. I had been using a manual pump before I bought this one and got better results with it.
2,If you want pain this is the pump for you!,"I was using the medela pump in the hospital and once I got out I had to get my own, I thought I would save a little money and buy this one. BAD IDEA!! This pump is so painful my nipples were cracked. You are safer manually pumping.The way it suctions to the nipple is very painful. I suggest the medela it may mean a little more out of your pocket, but in the long run you will be alot more satisfied."
1,OUCH!!!!,"I had originally purchased the Evenflo pump and was disappointed because it kept breaking and then the motor started to go after only 2 1/2 months, so I brought it back and decided to try this pump instead. I put it all together and my first reaction was OUCH !!! The automatic suction/release is a great idea but this also has small bumps in the shield that hurt when using it. I also kept losing suction with the shield being so flexible it kept bending at the neck. Needless to say, it took me 3 days to pump one 4oz. bottle, so I will be returning this product."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"I bought this pump for my second child, I wish I hadn't. It is painful and difficult to use. I got more milk expressing by hand. I never got more than an ounce in 20 mins. I tried adjusting the settings but it never got better. I gave up on this pump after 8 weeks of trying. I wish I had bought a Medela instead. Because of health dept regulations, the store cannot refund for it. So now I have a pump I can't use, and still have to buy a new one."
4,very good value for money,"This is an easy to use, easy to clean pump, also it has very few parts to lose. I use mine twice a day to pump 4oz a go at work. I am a D size and have to use the nipple insert.<br /><br />When I first tried it I put the suction pump strength up too high and it hurt, the trick is to gradually increase the suction strength and to think of your baby. Do not always expect immediate let down especially if tense and try to pump at the same times each day as your body learns to supply at regular intervals.<br /><br />You do need to keep an eye on what you are pumping though, because if you do not clean the small filter well enough with soapy water then you can get the filter chamber backed up with milk, which is not good for the pump. If you see this happening shut the pump off, insert your little finger into the breast cup area and push it toward your nipple to break the vacumm seal, then unscrew the bottle a little to let the milk drain.... then clean the filter properly !"
1,Ouch!,"I thought this would be good for occasional pumping. However, it leaves my nipples really sore. I can only stand to use it every few days. I then tried the Medela brand, oh my, it's so much better. Spend your $40 much more wisely!!"
3,"This pump is alright, but it could be better.","I only use the pump once in a while. Sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it doesn't, but overall, it works well. It's just noisy and sometimes uncomfortable. It has adjustable suction power, but if it's not up all the way, you don't get much. It's alright for it's value, but I might have chosen a different one if I had known about a better one."
2,easy to use but did not last long,I used this pump once a day or less and it stopped working after about 6 weeks. While it was working it worked well and I liked being able to have one hand free while pumping.
1,Can I give it negative stars?,"This pump is a worthless piece of junk. I received it as a gift and it broke after a few uses. (Even when it did work it was woefully slow, and single pump action is just a waste of time - go with the double!) The customer service people were helpful, and I sent it back. They sent me another pump which broke again after several uses. The problem was with the suction mechanism - it kept failing. The second time it broke they were less helpful and tried to tell me it was my fault the interior mechanism was failing. Did I know I was only supposed to boil the plastic parts? Please, how insulting.I finally broke down and bought the Pump in Style, which, $300 price tag be damned, was SO worth it. I know it seems expensive, but really, the money couldn't be better spent. If you plan to do any more than occasional (once per week) pumping, buy the Medela. I got mine on e-bay for $100 including shipping."
2,Yikes!,"I bought this pump because I became painfully engorged when I got home from the hospital. Well, that was the only time it really worked! I had to turn it way up to get proper suction, and even then it takes at least 20 minutes to get 2 ounces. The breast shield, with its massage bumps, is painful. And the valve doesn't always release to let the milk collect. I had to break suction every other minute just to keep it from flooding. And the noise! It sounds like mooing. Do yourself a favor and don't bother with this pump."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"This pump sucks!!! Well actually it doesn't. It takes me 1/2 hour just to get 2oz. You get what you pay for, don't waste your money. A good hospital grade pump is still way less then you would pay for formula!"
1,!!!!!!! Money Better Spent On Another Product !!!!!,"Well I bought the First Years battery/corded powered brest pump for my girlfriend after reading the reviews on this web site. We have a manual powered pump, yet I decided to buy a powered one, because her arms often get tired after a short period of time pumping. I bought this product because of the price, and the one our two good reviews I read on this site. This pump was a waste of money. It hurts her while pumping, it's loud, the disc is made of a soft material as opposed to a hard material. This makes it hard to apply and stay put - it bends a lot... you get what you pay for - you want a cheap product - you'll get cheap quality. I will spend the rest of my life trying to get First Years back for this one - just purely based off of principle..."
1,Don't waste your money,"IF you want to bleed and hurt, buy this pump. It took over thirty min to get one oz. Don't waste your money!!!"
4,WORKS & FEELS GREAT!!,I BOUGHT THIS PUMP AFTER TRYING A MANUAL EVENFLO & AN AUTOMATIC DOUBLE PUMP WHEN MY NIPPLES BECAME CRACKED & WERE BLEEDING (BABY IS AN AGRESSIVE NURSER) AND FOUND THIS ONE TO BE THE BEST. THE AUTOMATIC SUCTION RELEASE IS SO CONVENIENT. THE SHEILD IS PLIABLE AND FLEXIBLE MAKING A GOOD SEAL. I THINK THIS IS AN IDEAL PUMP FOR SMALLER BREASTED WOMEN BECAUSE OF THE PLIABLE SHIELD. I CAN PUMP +/- 4OZ FROM EACH BREAST IN ABOUT 15-20 MIN. THE PUMP IS VERY COMFORTABLE. WHY BUY A NAME (MEDELA) WHEN YOU CAN BUY A GREAT PRODUCT FROM A GREAT COMPANY AT A REASONABLE PRICE!
3,Those Mulberry Years,"Quite delightful. Strong acting, with a whimsical twist to its direction at most corners. A lovely 'olde worlde' manorial/village setting and atmosphere. Add wit and humour to good-natured advice and the use of intelligent psychology of one dealing with a reclusive, troubled senior citizen, and you have Mulberry. It brings in a little of the mystical and spiritual aspects of life (and death!) that are macabre but, together, they drive the whole narrative - giving purpose to Mulberry's role and mission in the household."
4,Only the British...,"Only the Brits could come up with a series like this. Charming, witty, poignant and they know when to quit. They tell the unusual story well with actors that are completly up to the task of walking a fine line and letting the story develop over time."
3,Humor with darkness,"The story had some cute moments, a little dark, with the listeners having to listen very closely to get the humor in the situation. I do not think that children should listen to the story unless the adult would be ready to speak with the child about death."
2,Tedious,"I bought this for Bob Larbey, who wrote the splendid series ""As Time Goes By."" He's the co-author here, and it must have the other guy who ruined this tedious sit-com. It goes on and on, for hours and hours, all to solve the mystery of who the stranger is and why he came to work for the cranky old rich lady. The loud laugh-track doesn't make things more pleasant. The actors do their best, but not much can be made of that witless, pointless script."
4,puzzled,I enjoyed this cd but I still am confused as I think there is another cd with the final episodes. This cd leaves you hanging as to how the ending was. Leaves you wondering if the main character ever completed his task.
1,"Series is great, transfer is terrible","I love this series - indeed I've got most of the episodes on VHS tape. I taped them probably the first time they appeared on PBS, over a decade or so ago.Since I *do* have them on tape, I knw what they're supposed to look like. Well...the problems should be obvious to everyone. The episodes are too dark, the film grainy, the color faded, and ""crisp and clear"" would not be the way to describe how everything looks.If you've got these episodes on tape, don't bother to ""upgrade"" to DVD, because there's no upgrade involved. If you don't have them on VHS, go ahead and buy a copy - or wait until a used version comes up for half price or less...that's really all these deplorable transfers are worth."
1,"Interesting Show, Flawed Transfer","It almost looks as though BBC Warner, at least in the initial episodes, has released a transfer of Mulberry in which the original broadcast version of the show with its indoor videotaped scenes was replaced with a version of the show in which the original videotape sequences were transferred onto film. This transfer of Mulberry's first several episodes is so faded and flat in the first two or three episodes of series one than it is either this, that British TV videographers in the 1990s became enamoured of mimicking the cinematography and lighting of film noir, or the transfer is just plain bad. Whatever the reason, I feel a bit cheated by BBC Warner."
5,mulberry,Mulberry - The Complete SeriesThis is a wonderful example of the fact that friendship and/or love has no boundaries. When you feel needed by family or friends it brings purpose to your life.
4,One Major Problem,The series is great BUT it was cancelled before they concluded the series which leaves you hanging. If you can deal with that (drives me crazy) then you should get it.
4,Mulberry,"This is a well scripted, and equally, well acted series that leaves you wanting more. It is funny, endearing, and thoroughly engrossing. We can all use a Mulberry, as we get old, to keep our lives worthwhile.Stan"
5,Mulberry: the complete Series.,The characters are an interesting assortment. The story line intriguing. we have watched this numerous times and always enjoy it.
4,Great Show....forever lacking,"I am torn over the review. I love the show. It was/is super. If you want to know about living turn to death :) the problem I have is that there is no ending...no final anything. You're forever lost in speculation. This does have its positive refelections...much like most of our lives we run into situations and people which we never see again and we are never able to resolve our feelings regarding them. I would have loved an ending, I watched expecting one...and now I am forever left wondering what happened when Spring came."
4,Wonderfully sweet!,"This British Comedy is a wonderfully sweet tale of a cantakerous old lady who slowly comes to enjoy life once again with the help of her buttler. He has been sent for a purpose which slowly becomes clear through the episodes. As with many BritComs it is slowly captures your interest as the characters come alive through clever acting and dialogue.Unfortunately, the BBC cancelled the series after two seasons so there is no real ending. It is nonetheless, charming and delightful and has earned a place in our British Comedy collection. Our other favorites include: To the Manor Born, Good Neighbors (The Good Life in the UK), Allo' Allo', As Time Goes By and others."
2,Not that good,"I borrowed this one frow the local library, and expected great things from one of my preferred pianists András Schiff. First track I heard was the Rondo, as it is my favourite part of the concerto. The sound however was very hazy and a strange kind of echo is heard, especially in parts where Schiff is making too much use of the pedal, which devastates the joyful, swift and mainly punctual performance this piece of music asks for. Off to the adagio then, which is beautifully played, but again lacks the clearness I'm looking for. I won't recommend this set for anyone new to Brahms; instead I'd try the GILELS/JOCHUM set from DG. This one provides crystal clear piano playing and a wonderful sound."
4,Aerobic Step,"The product is really good and gives good cardio workout, and it is easy to learn for anybody.. I would recommend for anybody who want good cardio exercise at home."
2,Not for beginners,"I would not recommend this DVD to those who are new to step aerobics. I used to go to Step and Sweat classes at the gym so I am familiar with step aerobics, but I found it confusing. Her style is hard to follow. I think if you can keep up and finish it would be a great workout though. Good luck. :-)"
5,Getting back in a routine,"What can I say, after all these years I still gravitate to the stepper. I am easing my body backstop a routine and this is a great resource. The trainer has a good voice and does well with making transitions. I will look for another one of her videos when I need to spice it up from my current collection."
3,What he said,"For a 60mm fan it pushes plenty of air......but it is one of the loudest fans out there. Moved up a board in a server and needed more 'wind tunnel'.....fan works well for this....if your server closet is at the end of the hall, or in/next to someone's office who you're not a huge fan of. Turns out the TF line is probably a better bet, but it goes by ambient temp which isn't always going to tell the story of the component you are trying to cool."
2,Low Flow Case Fan,"This case fan doesn't move enough air to be really useful. Although well constructed with double ball bearing,at only 12 CFM it barely moves air, simply not even close to being sufficient to cool anything. It's 2600 RPMwith a rated noise level of 20 dBa. At this RPM I'd expect at least 20-30 CFM airflow. Bad blade design killsthis product's performance. I've been buying CoolerMaster and other mfr. fans that cool alot more and are justas quiet. Look elsewhere for a better case fan."
1,The optical failure,"I received my Exilim EX-Z1200 camera two days ago and turned it on twice. The second time I turned it on the telephoto casing jammed and would not close. The camera doesn't work now. I did not even get the charger out of the wrapper. I just got off the phone with Casio, they did not help at all. Yes, I am looking to get it replaced so now I will try to see what Amazon can do for me."
1,Lens Error out of the box,"I was very disappointed when I saw the ""LENS ERROR"" message on the LCD screen the first time we turn the camera ON. I am sending it back and getting a Cannon instead."
1,WHERE IS MY ORDER?,"Where is my order? this is the second time it took so long to get it? and your account doesnt have any contacting number/seller? So, when i am gonna receive it?"
1,Poor recording,"The recording quality is not up to par. That's not what makes this disc a little weak for the genre. It sounds trite and borrowed, my best description. Makes a nice coaster. You can pick it up for very little dough, however. I don't know. It just isn't too exciting."
2,Hard to Watch!,"This so called Masterpiece by a few was incredible Boring and hard to watch ""Padre Padrone is very slow at times like waiting for water to boil. I hated to see the way the Father abuses his little Child. I didn't cared for it at all! ..Thank You"
1,Fox Lorber DVD...experience the worst DVD transfer,"a true story, about living under unbelievable paternal cruelty. the landscape must be beutiful, but this dvd transfer manages to obscure all that. this is the type of product you get when vulgar and dishonest people are involved in its making; this becomes more apparent when it involve the production of art-related materials, where ultimate crftmanship is required. I hope that a remastered version well be published sometimes in the future. avoid this dvd and all Fox Lorber dvd."
5,A classic.,"Ignore Maltin. He's out of his league when it comes to reviewing movies of any substance or ambition. This is an unbelievably powerful story of an illiterate shepherd who survives a brutal upbringing through the power of education. It's a movie about redemption through the written and spoken word. It's as stylistically audacious as anything Scorsese ever made. It's bawdy, beautifully acted, terrifying and whimsical. There's nothing quite like it, except maybe the Taviani Brothers' other movies (The Meadow, Kaos, Good Morning, Babylon). It's one of my favorites."
4,Child Abuse Story,"A story is of a boy abused regularly by a peasant father who depraved him from schooling and sent in the army to become a radio professional with scarce verbal skills, illiteral. Boy did it right, looked for a cattle, copulated with other shepherds and animals and did not migrate to Germany because his dad betrayed him by not signing papers properly.Actually, old bastard deserved a good knack in head."
5,Great for expectant parents,This is perfect to display your baby's ultrasound photo and if you record the heartbeat you can add it to the sound on the frame! It's pocket and travel sized!!
4,Great for Pre-schoolers,"I bought this product for my 4 year old. I recorded myself singing our good morning song. I can set it to go off in time for her to get up for Sunday school, or pre-school. And on the mornings she doesn't have to go anywhere, we can tell her how late she has to stay in bed. My only problem was that the first one I bought came from a local drugstore, and had been on their shelf a long time. It wasn't long before the voice alarm quit, and then the whole thing died. I'm planning to buy another one from Babiesrus.com."
2,Not Much to Recommend,"There was very little excitement here, too much sermonizing, and it was written in first person in such a perfunctory manner that it read like a teenager's diary, although the ""diarist"" was a lawyer. Just not my kind of book. I read an earlier Singer book which wasn't bad but this one didn't measure up."
4,Great Read w/ Interesting Twists & Plot,"This is a good, if not great, read but I didn't believe it stood out enough to rate a 5. However, if you like legal thrillers and a good plot then I believe this book is great. I'm new to Singer but he does a great job much like Grisham in building the characters and then pushing them through a great story and it is easy-to-read."
2,waiting for credit....,"I think the product itself is good enough....but I received the wrong one and sent it back for a refund, less shipping, of course.... still havent heard back from them.....waiting ........"
4,One of the roots of blues rock.,"Johnny Jenkins was one of the youngest blues masters when this record first came out. His style is funkier than traditional slow blues and boogie, and he is one of the major influences on british and American blues rock giants that followed him."
4,"Legendary, Dripping With Soul","With all the talk here about Duane, etc I thought I'd help out with the actual lineup. Just a who's-who of early Capricorn and why it became so successful back then....Johnny Jenkins - vocals, guitar (4), harmonica (2, 6, 7, 8), foot stomping (4), lead guitar (10, 11)Duanne Allman-electric guitar (9 [left channel]), slide guitar (4, 6), dobro (1), rhythm guitar (10, 11)Berry Oakley - bass (4, 6, 7)Jaimoe- timbales (1, 3, 9)Butch Trucks - drums (1, 9)Paul Hornsby- Wurlitzer piano (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11), piano (10), Hammond B-3 organ (11), rhythm guitar (6)Eddie Hinton - cowbell (9)Tippy Armstrong- cabasa (9)Pete Carr - acoustic guitar (6), electric guitar (1, 9 [right channel]), guitar (2, 3, 5, 7, 8)Robert Popwell - bass (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11), timbales (5), shaker & woodblocks (2)Johnny Wyker- shaker & woodblocks (2)Jimmy Nalls- guitar (7)Ella Brown- vocals (3)Southern Comfort - vocals (1, 9)Johnny Sandlin- drums (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11)"
3,"Review of ""The Truman Show""","The Truman Show written by Andrew Niccol in 1998 shows the last few days of a reality show. Truman Burbank is the main character. He is the only person in this show who is no actor. Everything around him is fake. Even his hometown Seahaven is only a film studio but Truman doesn't know this. Christof is the director who controls everything. He gives the directions to his parents, his wife and his friend. In these last few days a lot of strange things happen so that Truman may soon find out everything.Andrew Niccol wants to show the impertinence of the media which do not respect the rights of human beings.In my opinion the subject of the book is very interesting and it is worth dealing with it. But in this case it is easier to watch the movie because the book is difficult to read because of all the stage directions."
4,"Reviw of ""The Truman Show""","The book ""The Truman Show"" by Andrew Niccol was written in the 20th century. The story is about a 29 year old man who has been televised every moment of every day. The book is mostly dramatic but sometimes funny. Truman Burbank lives in a small artificall town named ""Seaheaven"". This world was created by Chrsitof, the director of the reality-show. In this show everyone of his frinds is an actor. The only genuine person is Lauren. He has fallen in love with her.Imagine you find out that nothing in your life is genuine, you are controlled by others and everythin is filmed by cammeras so that millions can watch you. This is the message of the book. And it should make you think about how the media control our lives.I like the story because we can identify with Truman and his situation. I recommend the film and the book because sometimes it is quite funny.YOUR RICHI"
5,GREAT!!!EXCELLENT!!!STUPENDOUS!!!,The movie was great. The book is great. But the greatest was watching it being made.THANKS JIM CARREY!
3,Brilliant Script with Great Satire,"""The Truman Show"" is, in my opinion, one of the best written movies of the past few years. It makes me angry when people say it's not original, not thought provoking, and nothing special. The screenplay by Andrew Niccol (and director Weir, who changed the setting from New York to Florida) shows us just how absurd it is, the lengths that producers of television go to entertain us. The brilliant satirical shots at television, in sensationalizing and exposing peoples lives (with Christof making everything that Truman does seem to be a big deal) are some of the high points of this brilliant script. Wonderful writing from an excellent writer. Niccol should have won an Oscar, but once again, Hollywood makes a big deal out of the TRUELY OVERRATED nonsense."
1,The emperor's new clothes,"A movie for stupid people to feel smart. So we all watch to much t.v.? Really, I wasn't aware of that. Unfortunately, according to the b.o. receits, too many of us also watched an overrated, empty movie. The ""Cable Guy"" had the same exact theme, but was funny, unpretentious, even poignant. Of course, it didn't do well. Hard to believe you had people actually calling this the movie of the decade. Probably the same slumming intellectuals who thought ""The Brothers McMullen"" was on par with Woody Allen. Ed Harris is an incredible actor, but he essentially got an oscar nomination for wearing a hat. What we have here is Jim Carrey acting like himself, but not funny. That would be o.k, if there was any drama, but there isn't any. Where's the tension? For such a great premise, there's no pay-off. The same people who loathed Carrey now all think he was robbed of oscar attention. What hypocrisy. The only things being robbed were their common sense, and my money."
4,Great gift,"I just received this plant as a gift today. It arrived well wrapped, in great health and with an attractive pot. Because I tend to kill plants, check back in with me in a few months and we can discuss whether it is still living."
1,not pleased I,"I dont know if this product is dormant or dead. No leaves, giving it great care. I have a grow lamp on it. Both of my azalea and geranium will have to be reordered. Any advise given will be helpful."
1,Just a bush,"Not worth the money.The plant that I received is not even close to the pictures that are shown. There is no single trunk, it's just a bush.Bonsai's are supposed to look like trees but without a trunk there's not really anything I can do to remedy this... Rather disappointed, and I'm not sure if I can return it or not.What I have received makes me quite suspicious of the 5-star reviews that this product has also received."
2,not like the picture,I sent this as a gift to my cousin. She said there were no flowers when she received it and it was very small. I was disappointed.
2,didnt know id have to put my plant outside,i am not happy with the fact that i have to winter my azalea bonsai. im guessing it is just a normal plant that has been cut to make it look like a bonsai. next time i will read the fine print.
1,Very Disappointed,"I received this plant for Mother's Day from my daughter. There were no flowers and looked nothing like the picture. Like several other reviews, the plant was dead within the month, although I followed the instructions. When watering the plant, because the DIRT was so hard, the water just ran right off, rather than soaking in. Finally, I kept it sitting in a pan of water in addition to the regular watering. Unfortunately, by then it was too late. Instead of the package being addressed to me, it was addressed with my daughter's name and my address. I do not recommend buying this plant."
1,cheap is cheap,The plant looks like it was shaved. It does not look like the picture at all. No quality. I have purchased other bonsai from other vendors and they look great.As if they trimmed the dead leaves to look good but the shape of the plant is bad and after 3 days the leaves are starting to fall.
1,just a small bush,"I have received this Satsuki Azalea as a gift. The person who gave it to me was very excited ... until the box was opened. Wat we have found in the box was just a small bush, not cut, not trained at all, nothing that was even close to the picture. And I do not mean flowers. Well, I thought that it was my job to train it, which I will do. By no means however it was the intent of the gift giver."
1,"Misadvertised, what you see is not what you get","Item shown with green pottery planter, but NO SUCH PLANTER is included. This is completely misleading! It is also listed in ""indoor plants"" and the promotional pictures show it both nestling in a cozy living room, sitting on a porch and planted. HOWEVER, when it arrives, it lacks (1) the pottery container (arriving in a cheap disposable nursery grow pack, (2) contains instructions telling the recipient to plant it outdoors no matter what the season.We are asking amazon to explain and/or deliver instructions on using this as a houseplant and delivering the pottery container pictured. I hope they'll do the right thing!"
2,pot is broken,"I bought this beautiful plant for Mother's Day and it arrived just right in time, but we are dissapointed when we found out that the pot is broken and obviously you cannot grow it. I am sure that Amazon will do some actions about this to compensate our inconvenience."
1,House Made of Boredawm,"Worst movie ever. Seriously. The acting is horrible, the music is annoying, the plot is weak. The only thing decent about this video is a cool preview for ""The Crippled Masters"". A Kung Fu movie about a pair of crippled martial artists seeking revenge on their evil amputators."
4,English Fairy and Folk Tales,"English Fairy and Folk Tales contains sections of hard to find books, which makes it excellent for the price. Here you will find sections from Robert Hunt's, Popular Romances of the West Country (Cornwall). As this is no longer in print and you will probably pay a high price for an original copy of that title, English Fairy and Folk Tales is worth getting for this alone. The book's tales are the usual stories of England and Cornwall, though, nothing obscure or especially unusual and the chapter on witchcraft was disappointingly short. Mostly concerned with the usual tales of ghosts, some good stories of the phantom hounds (i.e. Cheney's Hounds, Dando Dogs, The Barghest), witchcraft, and Fairies. So if you are looking for obscure tales you will probably want to skip it! Once again, it is worth purchasing if you are looking for a cheaper copy of some of the tales from Hunt's, Popular Romances of the West Country."
4,SUGAWOLF: IN A PACK ALL HIS OWN!!,"Dubee is the ""Real Deal"". He's commin kinda Cavvy with the original Coolio, Da'Unda'Dog. Pretty good CD, definately get the heads bobbin like bouy. ""Body Bleeding"" is tight, Track 7, ""Game"" another supreme demonstration of two god gifted talents collaborating. BUY ANY CD AFFILIATED WITH CAVVY R. RECORDS, YOUNG BLACK BROTHA RECORDS, ROMP RECORDS, STRICTLY BUSINESS RECORDS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, MOB LIFE RECORDS."
5,A trip down memory lane...,"I have been a fan for many years, and although I am not a christian there is something so uplifting about her music. Anyone from any walk of life would surely find this CD a blessing to have. Full of beautiful spituality!"
4,Real Canons nice and LOUD,"I am a fan of the 1812 overture and have collected many variations from different conductors and orchestra of the 1812. This one is by far have the best effect of the Canon, just as Tchaikovsky would wanted it. Only reason it did not get a 5 star is that overall this album only have 3 tracks on it. And in my opinion, other than the bad canon part, the other time with the bells are just okay compared to the other version. Unless you are a collector of the 1812 overture, you would not be getting a lot of music for your money on this album."
5,I don't have training in classical music.,"I don't have training in classical music like the other reviewers, but I am quite stirred whenever I hear the Cleveland Orchestra's version of Ode to Joy. It makes me want to give the CD to all my friends and relatives even though they don't listen to classical music.The reason I voted one review as unhelpful was that he said there were better versions, but didn't name them. Please don't keep them a secret!"
3,Not the best I've heard.,"This was the first CD of Beethoven's 9th I ever owned, and I liked it well until I bought and heard other versions. My main problem with it is the pacing - it seems entirely too slow throughout. I vastly prefer a faster pace for the 9th, and this version seems to drag as a result. Otherwise the recording is fine, but many other versions seem better."
5,Purified Hip - Hop,"As most of you will know, Sol and Skrapz used to be in the detroit horrorcore band ""House of Krazees"", so you would be forgiven for thinking that the ""Level Jumpers"" would be a horrorcore band, but they are the complete opposite. They rap over softer beats and the occasional hard rap beat is thrown in. All three band members flow really well on this album. Buy this album if your looking for a rap album with a difference."
4,Excellant but for a slight airy sound???,"I have listened to both discs repeatedly since arriving last week & absolutely adore them! Right from the first time I listened, however, I noticed an airy sound over some of the songs, but nothing I couldn't lose notice of while enjoying the great selection of songs. The sound may be due to remastering some older recordings, but I don't really know. I thoroughly enjoy the album enough to forgive the slightly breathy background & it is only in a few of the many songs (it may very well be less noticeable if you are not using extra bass settings & sennheiser headphones as I do). If you are a smooth jazz fan or are open minded about different styles of instrumental relaxation cds, I highly recommend this double disc cd! A couple hours of escape from daily stress or a perfect evening calmer in my opinion."
4,Great sounds,We play this in thr office when things get especially hectic. It really helps. Penelope K. Gonzalez.
2,Technology Tragedy,"Any one who is a Liza fan is going to be disappointed in how uneven this recording is. You simply do not get the power of her voice and even worse, the level of the sound is uneven prohbiting a turn up of the volume from being a solution. It is hard to imagine that the album producers for such a major star would let such a poor quality recording be issued. It's like listening to a concert from the lobby. No wonder so many used versions are for sale. It is a shame cause the song selection may be the best from any of those existing and it was recorded whn Liza was still @ the peak of her abilities."
4,Liza at her best!!!!!!!!,"Back in 1987 I attended 2 performances of Liza's show at Carnegie Hall. One was on closing night. I remember fans waiting at the box office hoping for cancellations. Scalpers were having a field day, some getting arrested! Liza's perfomances were brilliant. Pure singing, and never sounding better. I also remember at the end of the last show, she did an encore of Shine On Harvest Moon, and then the audience, going wild, were yelling for her to make a speech, which she did. Despite some technical flaws, this is Liza's best live recording. She deserved a Best Female Vocalist Grammy nomination. It was a robbery that she didn't get one."
5,Works great,"Bought these to replace a burnt out rear turn signal on my 2002 Ford Escort. Not much else to say other than they work, shipped fast with amazon prime per usual. Installed now for a couple months."
5,They work,"I know I have to use up words for a review. They work well, very well. Good lamps. Very goo"
3,KILLER B,"This tv movie starts out very well, staging some frightening bee attacks that are genuinely uncomfortable and scary. Director Rockne O'Bannon leads Robert Hays, Nancy Stafford, Ryan Phillippe and Dennis Christopher through some sharp moments. However, once the attack becomes confined in the Hays household, the movie loses its overall steam. Sure, we care about the family and their plight, but its narrow focus doesn't carry forth the horror of the mass attack possibilities.Ryan Phillippe is good in one of his early roles, but why in the world does the family put up with him; he's the one who decides to shoot up the primary hives, and then he freezes when he's needed to help out.Dennis Christopher is cool in his role as the resident bee expert who cheerfully explains bee venom at a packed outside cafe where all the patrons start asking questions.Not a bad movie, but one I felt could have been better."
4,Very entertaining and realistic!,"Presents a realistic view of biking and Harleys. From wiping the pelting rain from your sunglasses with one hand while hanging on to the bar with your other, to the unique biker grimlins - gravelly curves, butthead motorists, etc."
4,THE TITLE OF THE BOOK SAYS IT ALL,A MAN'S TALE OF GETTING BITTEN BY THE BUG THAT IS HOG FEVER RICHARD'S WRITTING STYLE BRINGS IT ALL BACK.
3,Hog Fever,"Hog fever is a good read, although the setting is England and most of the stories are about places I have never heard of or been (and probably will never go!). It encompasses the journey of many a Harley rider,in the beginning cost concerns, to the eventual, money doesn't matter just make it chrome and Fast!"
1,LaPlante proves money can't buy everything,"As a motorcyclist with over thirty years' experience, I found in ""Hog Fever"" one stunning truth: There are people who ride motorcycles without the vaguest idea what it is all about. LaPlante's most endearing quality is his unabashed candor in confessing his purile need to pose as something he's not: cool. I read the book through in spite of myself, waiting in vain for some germ of insight. Alas. Skip this book and go directly to Pirsig's timeless ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance."""
2,Disappointing,"When my friends & relatives rib me about the (relatively) high mileage I put on my bike, I usually respond by saying, ""I didn't buy the thing to look at it in my garage!"" By Mr. LaPlante's own admission, however, that's exactly why he bought his. This book is a painstakingly detailed account of the author's own poseur nature. Everything he does is motivated by a desire to impress others and be seen as a ""heavy bro"" (I guess this means a ""cool guy"" or something) by his equally poseur friends. This is a book for people who spend more time polishing their bikes than riding them, whose idea of a good time is standing around drinking and ogling the billet jewelry on each others' bikes. Although amusing in spots, it very artfully misses the whole point of riding."
4,"Fun, Entertaining, not for everyone!","I loved the book. I could relate to some areas of his Harley learning experience, like going from a Sporty to a Big Twin, although I was a bit more into the performance rather than add on cosmetics, right from the start. Also I can relate looking through Easyriders looking at and reading about what other have done to their bikes. It becomes consuming!!"
4,A Poignant Look at Chinese Buddhism,This story of a Buddhist monk search for his place in the wheel of life is candidly written and enjoyable. Chen-hua has very interesting things to say about the practice of Buddhism in China. He finds abuses of power at several of the monasteries he visits. A must read for someone looking for an introduction to Chinese Buddhist doctrine and principle.
5,"Such a happy, upbeat tune. I love Yuzu!","This song, ""Mata Aeru Hi Made"" (translates into: ""Until We Meet Again"") is a super catchy, lilty song by J-Pop duo Yuzu. With a strong tambourine, guitar and harmonica sound, it takes on a folksy feel. Even if you don't understand Japanese, you'll feel the happiness exuding from the song and you'll fall in love with it. (Omg, I sound like a Engrish t-shirt saying!)The song is from the Doraemon soundtrack, but is also available as this single. If you look it up on YouTube, you'll be able to preview the song and also see how the video is all smiles. You can also do a search online for lyric translations, but basically, the song lyrics talk about a friendship and parting -- until we meet again, let's stay unchanged and remember all the great memories and not forget our dreams. Aww, it just makes me happy thinking about it! I heart Yuzu!"
5,Even BETTER in person!,"I was hesitant to purchase this set because the trim on the comforter and most of the bumper looked like it was done in a ""hunter"" green velvet, and I HATE velvet. I bought it anyway, because the animals (and overall look of the set) was the cutest I could find in the jungle theme. Well I just received the set yesterday and I was thrilled to find that it's not velvet at all! The color is actually a little lighter than it appears in the pictures (it's like a seafoam green), and it's a soft chenille corduroy. I could NOT be happier with this set! If jungle is your theme, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,What I was looking for.,I had this item on my registry from babies r us for the 9 piece set. I then found this 6 piece set with more of the items I wanted. A lot better price then with more useful items than the 9 piece set and a lot cheaper than at babies r us. Very glad i purchased this item. It's colorful and will last me through his toddler stage. The only thing I would warn about that didn't bother me but is something to consider the window valance does not cover the curtain rod because of the style. If you do not like the curtain rod showing it's something to consider. But in my opinion it doesn't really look all that bad. I would definitely recommend this product.
5,LOVE IT!,"Everything that comes with this set is just so cute and adorable! I'm so glad I got this! The blankets and bumpers all use different materials, which is going to be great for developing my little ones touch sensory."
1,not as pictured,"only has small bar for old style weights, olympic weights are to large and move to much on such a small barBody Solid GSCR349 2 x 3 Seated Calf Raise Machine"
1,The Blind Leading The Blind,How such an interesting topic can be handled so boringly is perhaps a strong clue as to why this volume is not readily available.More substantive reading can be found by other writers in the field who actually ARE artists or who have more sensitivity to this relatively new area. Gene Youngblood comes to mind.
5,Excellent choice,"MY MORTAL ENEMY by Willa Cather (one of my favorite authors) is about a couple who get married despite the concerns of others. Things do not go as wonderfully as they hoped, but at the end of the day, not as awfully everyone expected.To say that this couple had a strange but profound way of loving each other is not giving away the story. Absorbing the nuances of such love can only be accomplished by reading the book yourself."
4,Verdi Requiem Robert Shaw,This is an excellent recording and fairly easy to follow. One difficulty is that the solos overwhelm the chorus to the extent that the sound makes study of the work somewhat difficult.
4,Coming up from the streets to the Rap Game!,"Yeah, low budget and all but it had a very nice plot and some good acting. Two brothers from the hood/barrio are trying to start a record label. But some evil homies from the other side are trying to knock their hustle. Lots of street action and rap music. The production was so so but they shot it on film. The music was very nice. and it wrapped up with a tight little twist ending. Worth the rental. PEACE!"
4,The curse of the Yellow Sticker,"I've been cooking using a pressure cooker for well over 5 yrs now. I previously owned a miro pressure cooker and this one took me a little getting used to. The yellow sticker on the lid just doesn't want to come off. Its like GLUED glued.And.. don't read the recipe book word to word. use your own judgement else you'll end up with a burnt mess atleast once and will spend a fair bit of time with a metal scrub. For people who have used other pressure cookers, refer to the product manual for cooking times as this cooker is different from what you are used to."
2,SLOW SSSShipping,"Ordered on 4/10/2006, it's reported that it would be shipped on May 17, 2006. Expected to get it around June 1, 20064/28/2006I decide to pick chef's design 8-liter pressure cooker, since this 6-liter would never come..."
1,Not so Great Pressure Cooker,"If you only want to use it for about six months: ""Solid construction and easy to use. Makes great Beef Stew & Pot Roast in a hurry."" That was my review right after I bought it. A year later and nothing but trouble. Replaced upper side handle and gasket seal because all the pressure was escaping through the safety valve. Did not correct the problem. Will probably have to replace the other side, because the gasket activating control will not stay in place. My understanding is that the plastic handles are not part of the warranty. I see on the bottom it says ""Designed in USA, Made in China"". I sure do miss American Craftsmanship."
2,Problem with pressure safety valve,"Nice heavy stainless cooker. However, a small metal cylinder fell out of the safety valve in the upper side handle of the lid. It appears something has gone missing e.g. a spring or fastener, but the troubleshooting section of the users' manual makes no mention of the safety valve and I cannot find a local distributer to repair it. Now the pot is useless as a pressure cooker because the open hole makes it impossible to build pressure."
1,Very Misleading,"[...] I, too, thought this was a compilation of ""Various Artists"" and it reminded me of one of those ""Kidz Bop"" CDs. It may has well have been little children singing the songs.I would like to suggest, actually beg, AMAZON to make sure they have a disclaimer, in bold red letters at the top of the page, indicating that the CD may not be what one expects. I certainly did not and was extremely disapointed.I am now responsible for returning this item, for which I will not receive a refund on the shipping costs.So, buyers BEWARE....this CD is a complete waste of money."
1,"Crap, crap, Chinese Crap","Horrible product! DO NOT BUY! This little piggy went nowhere! Lasted less than a week and would not charge. Opened it up to replace the batteries and there were none! WTF, really? What a waste of money."
3,Cute flashlight for kids,"wanted a flashlight for my obsessed daughter. She wanted a flashlight in bed everynight and was tired of batteries draining. This is adorable and does the job. The lights were really bright, boardering too bright but after a few weeks the strength of the light is dulled. Not sure if this is normal or not. Overall like the flashlight and love that is recharges. And for the price its a great deal"
5,Touching & Accessible,"Most of us get involved in the repeating ""stories"" of our interactions and our lives, and stop noticing our deeper connections to ourselves and to the universe.To me, Wendy Palmer's book offers a doorway to that deeper experience -- through the Aikido practices she teaches, and the ways she describes our interactions.Surprisingly revealing, the book tells about Wendy Palmer's own life experiences, and suggests ways to touch-in to the more universal connections we often ignore.One way to seek balance, she suggests, is to focus attention on our vertical connection with earth (grounding) and sky (spirit) so that it becomes as strong as our horizontal connection to our ""life stories."""
2,Skip This'n,"Unless you're a serious collector of blaxploitation films like I am, I suggest you skip this one. The Black Gestapo is predictable and boring. The fight scenes look like they were choreographed by those same people who did the corny Star Man fights (circa 1968). The Black Six has an ending so laughable, you'd think Laurel and Hardy must have written it."
1,The nails sold here are bright finish which means no corrosion protection,"Just be careful, the PN here matches Bostitch site for these however all the pictures are incorrect. All of them show these nails coated as either zinc or galvanized finished and they are not, the box says bright finish. I have them rusting in the box after a week on my covered patio. I've shot a few hundred of these and they shoot fine and seems strong but I'm using them in Florida and they will surely rust out in record time and as such they probably are not even up to code for here. So unless you live somewhere dry and cold find a galvanized nail. Great price but not when you have to buy twice (a galvanized replacement). Anyone want to buy 4000 nails? Looks like I have a few hundred nails to re-shoot."
2,nails have bending problem in our application,"After reading the data on these nails, I purchased a box of the .131 and requested that our builder use them to attach structural 1 OSB to studs. This is a retrofit project so the studs are dry (50yrs dry) In the field, they report that the nails are bending. They are not penetrating the OSB properly or the studs are too dry. Since here in CA we are concerned with shear not hurricane pressure, we switched to 10d instead. Shipping was nearly as much as the product."
3,Rehashed Freddy Jones Band,"Although a decent albums, its plagued with a few songs that are barely worth listening to. Of the seven or so remaining tracks that are good, only about three of them are great, original tracks. The rest sound too much like old rifts and beats recycled with new lyrics.Not a bad album altogether, but I wouldn't buy this album unless you're already an FJB fan, and feel like you need more."
5,Works great with Panasonic VDR-D210,Over the holidays I got my first mini DVD camcorder and when I went to go look for mini dvd's for it me and my husband found Memorex 30 min./1.4 GB Mini DVD-R (20-Pack) at what seemed to be a good price. After using it a few times I can say I am happy with the product and has had no problems with it.
4,Works with Sony,"Works with Sony DVD camcorders, but you will always get a message in your Sony Camcorder that says ""Sony DVD recommended""."
2,minidvd,This mini dvd is ok but vibrates a lot while in use. The price is however unbeatable. Purchase the tdk---- much better
3,Inexpensive but limited in use.,"It is inexpensive compared to the Sony discs. However, You cannot use them in any DVR so you are limited to burning the CD to a regular size CD or playing it on the Video recorder. I like just sticking in the cd and watching it."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Given that this is a well known brand and the price was low I thought I could not loose, but I did. I used a DVD to record my son ice skating with some friends. I was glad we got it all on ""tape"". The play back started out fine but then the video started freezing in spots. The audio would contine but the video would be still. This video freezing became more frequent with longer intervals. I have serveral DVD players in my house and tried the disc in each and got the same result. The same video freezing happened with a second DVD from the pack. The rest of the pack will go in the garbage where it belongs."
3,I don't know yet...,"I recently bought this particular product, and I'm not sure if it's as great as some say. The very first disk I tried to use was not good. I had to take another from the pack, and so far it seems to be okay. Will see how it goes."
5,Quality discs,These are great discs. Compatible with Sony devices. Offer 20 minutes of HD recording. The 20 pack is a good way to have a good supply on hand.
2,Sometimes works,"Out of the pack of 20 dvd's, roughly 30% of them are faulty. The discs do not finalize and therefore, all of the video on them is lost. Be careful when using these discs, especially if you are trying to record something that is meaningful."
3,Not one of Blake's best but nice anyway; 3 1/2 stars,"I always enjoy Jennifer Blake novels, and I liked ARROW TO THE HEART, but not as much as some of her other books. I found the pace very slow for most of the book and then the ending was rushed. Also, the sex scenes, when Rowan and Katrine FINALLY got going, were too drawn out and the language was so flowery that I just skimmed through them. The mysterious murderer and the plot twists were very intriguing and really surprised me when they were revealed. The Court of Love was way too philosophical for me but that is a matter of personal taste and it doesn't surprise me that many people liked it. This was a very nice book to read if you like historical romances so I do recommend it if you like that genre."
4,Arrow to the heart,"I enjoyed the book. I love historical romances, this was great and I loved the very interesting ending. This was my first book by this author but I will be sure to read her other books."
1,Arrow to the Heart,"Wish I had not purchased this book. Unbelievable scenario.Also, Writer seems to be unfamiliar with the real Louisiana or at least failed to describe it."
5,Enchanting and informative,I attended a workshop by Michael Katz before I read the book. I learned why I felt drawn to certain stones and also learned valuable therapies to use for myself and others. The book is a wonderful story and unique reference on the properties of gemstones.
3,Karen Cliche is Blonde!!,"Karen Cliche! One of the earlier efforts while still in her blonde mode. Fairly mundane, but Karen is as beautiful as ever. Bought this just because of her. Oh well, I'm addicted! }:o)"
2,Daunting.,"I realize I may have been asking for it when I bought a book containing THREE THOUSAND solved problems, but this book is not formatted well for student use.The problems are solved, but they aren't posed without solutions rights next to them. This makes it very difficult to actually ""work on"" any of these 3,000 problems without awkwardly covering up the solution, rewriting the problem, and attempting from there.Also, it doesn't do a good job of connecting or explaining topics. All you see is a bunch of math.Bought it for my Chemistry 1A final at UC Berkeley- and I found it of significantly less use than the textbook."
5,Childhood Cancer Survivors,"As a survivor of an adolescent cancer, this is the book I have been waiting for over the last thirty years. The information here is concise, well organized, readable and well presented. The authors do a great job of pulling together diverse and disparate medical research and setting it out for the lay reader. The book is compassionately tied together by the many stories of survivors who lend their voices and experiences to what might otherwise be overwhelming medical information. This is a book that every survivor of childhood/adolescent cancer should have."
5,18 Year Survivor and Counting!!!,"I am an 18 year survivor of Osteoganic Sarcoma and I found this book to be one of the best and informative books I've ever read. I read things that I didn't even know about my disease or the long term late effects due to the chemotherapy I received. I will admit, at times it was TOO much information, but it was all factual and there were things that I read that I had to come to term with. I have an appointment at a Late Effects Clinic in a few weeks, and I am eager to get on with the rest of my life. A big Thank You to the authors who took so much time doing research and putting their own blood, sweat and tears into such an awesome project!!! Sincerely, Diane Trautman Smith"
2,ALMOST perfect,This book is ALMOST perfect. However it doesnt have the section review questions that come in the bound or loose leaf edition. If your prof. goes over those in class you are out of luck. I would not recommend the spiral bound edition.
1,unhappy,I was sent the wrong book twice. and ended up having to return the book and buy it elsewhere. this caused me to not have a book in class and struggle. Amazon was fine but the company that sold me the book was terrible and rude.
4,Neat stuff,"Erich Kunzel and the Pops do a great job with this disc. There are a lot of cool marches, some famous, some not so famous.It's a fun CD!"
3,Great sound quality - sucky songs,"The SACD sound quality of this compilation is very good. Unfortunately it is a compilation of sappy elevator music songs. Songs like ""Come on baby light my fire"" give me a break. There are a couple of decent cuts on it, but not worth the money spent.Not my favorite sampler disc. I'd pass this one up."
3,Good audio but marginal musical value,"It gets weary listening to Jacintha who appears way too often singing mushy, sentimental songs. I would have like it better if they included couple of tracks from Bill Murray singing at the Alpine Lodge. OTH the audio quality is top notch even listening on a regular cd player. I think it's extremely over-priced for what's offered. Potential buyers would be better off looking elsewhere unless buyers have an urgent need for MUSAC."
1,wrong picture for descrition,this is not the item described/ just to let you know..i will not buy w/out seeing proper item first
1,wrong image displayed for item,"It's hard to rate an item i do not own, and i won't purchase an item sight unseen. my ratings are based upon the fact that there is a problem with the image of the item. The item is a Jeff Gordon Tribute hood. The image displayed is a Tony Stewart hood. Get it in gear and put up a correct image so that the consumers will know what they are purchasing. And as a Jeff Gordon fan, i was a bit upset to see a Tony Stewart product displayed for a Jeff Gordon product."
3,"Great Recipes, But Kind of Improbable","This book contains some great recipes with a south-of-theborder-flavour, but all the same, you may find some of these bugs a tad bit exotic . . . where in the world can you get a half-pound of tree-hoppers anyway? So this might be a bit much for the novice without special resources, but on the whole is well worth the money."
5,I have 2 now,"Great size to have on hand. Makes a cute, small layer cake that is especially good to give away. Less waste."
5,Great Cake Pan! Not used for making cakes,I bought these two Wilton Aluminum Performance Pans 14 by 2-Inch Round Pan. But I am using them for make big hambugers: they work great for do hambugers giant hambugers molds. I use them for a fun gagge on my friends and so on. I like these pans for they are easy to clean and they do not spill out when cooking the bugers. They do good for making giant cookies also.
2,Not what expected,I ordered this for my 2012 Chevrolet Equinox LT1 and was SPECIFIC about that in my order. What I received was a cargo liner for a 2005 - 2009 Chevy Equinox!!!! The box it came in had seen better days and obviously been returned before AND the instructional booklet enclosed was for the 2011 Equinox!I did receive a prompt refund which was the only good part of this purchasing experience.Need I say more?
4,Good music and solid performances,"Well done big band renditions of familiar songs, including his biggest hit (in the U.S. at least) - ""Wonderland By Night."" Money well spent."
4,Give Myself To You - The Daou,"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""GIVE MYSELF TO YOU"" - THE DAOU1) Five Spot Radio Edit - 4:372) Grand Ballroom Mix - 9:183) Buzzard Dub - 5:294) At The Five Spot - 6:335) Give My Dub To You - 7:156) Peace & Love - 3:581993"
4,Old but Gold,"Only 4 stars since it's from 1983... But in calculating the position of the sun and other relevant parameters in estimating solar radiation, it's still unmached...Best Regards ..."
2,Chefs Design Customer Service,I cannot locate a 1-800 number for Chef's Design customer service. I purchased a pressure cooker about 4 years ago and until recently it worked great! However a small metal cylinder (safety pin?) fell out of the lid's side handle rendering it useless for pressure cooking. The instruction manual gives no information about the safety valve nor how to remove the side handle (no screws I can see) to determine what broke or how to fix it. Can anyone out there tell me who to contact for help?
4,Pressure Cooker Takes the Pressure Off,"I have never owned a pressure cooker before, but this one made a good first impression. Dishes that normally take hours are done in minutes, and all the food's flavor and nutrition is preserved.This unit is very sturdy and well-made. I like having a second lid so I can use it as a regular sauce pan as well as a pressure cooker. It is quickly becoming one of the most frequently-used pans in my kitchen."
5,Things you need to know,"This is a simply great kitchen utensil:It's made from stainless steel which is easy tokeep clean and which has none of the corrosionproblems that plague aluminum.The price is right. You can pay a lot for a fancySwiss model-four times as much in fact and in thiscase, you don't get what you pay for.It will add a dimension to your cooking. Dishesthat used to take all day can be cooked in an houror two and homemade stocks and soups will returnto your table.All of the safety problems that used to come withpressure cookers have been solved and there's no reasonto deny you and your family all that good food.Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine andthe forthcoming novel, bang-BANG from Kunati press.(ISBN 1601640005)"
5,Get this one...,"My new pressure cooker arrived yesterday. I used it last night to make a delicious soup. It's a perfect size for a family with children or anyone for that matter.The ease of use amazed me. I would suggest gettingGreat Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure orCooking Under Pressure by Lorna Saas to help get the most out of it.It's a way to prepare healthy foods in a short amount of time.Since it comes with a glass lid also, it can be used like a regular stock pot.If you need a pressure cooker, I feel this is the best deal out there right now. I spent hours on the internet looking and this was my choice!If you take the time to really learn how to use a pressure cooker then the pressure will be off when it comes to the question..What's for dinner?Have fun!"
2,The drumming ruins it.,"Have you EVER heard classical music that someone added a modern drum-beat to that didn't suck?Yeah, me neither.Too bad, the pieces that are just synthesizer aren't bad. He's no Wendy Carlos, obviously, but some of the tracks are somewhat charming. But the drumming just turns this into musical kitsch."
1,Too Electric,"While we like rock and ""electric"" renditions of classical, couldn't give this CD away. A bit tooo electric."
3,The Pimsleur Method is a bit slow for me,"This was my first exposure to the Pimsleur system of language learning. I found the tapes to be well produced technically, with excellent sound quality. I was disappointed at how slowly they moved, however. I understand the need for repetition in learning a language, but I wish they had covered more ground and just let me replay the tapes when I needed reinforcement. I became frustrated after going through 10 lessons and still not knowing any colors, days of the week, months, seasons, or even being able to count to 20. Perhaps some learners need more repetition, but I was exhausted after hearing, for example, the phrase meaning ""..would like"" presented 303 times(I counted). I am presently looking for some Creole tapes that present more information in a more concentrated fashion."
5,Flipbooks,Flick Books was a fine program for creating flip albums for your own computer. I am disappointed that it doesn't create something that can be shared with friends over the Internet.
1,There should be a zero-star option,"Garbage!!! That is almost all I can say about the six dollars and change I spent on this poor excuse of a book.I love horror. Its my favorite genre. But after reading two books by this author ( The Backwoods being the second and last I will ever read by this guy) I can't believe that he gets published. Weak, unbelievable charactors, weak plot, very insubstantial sub-plots. And what is this guys obsession with the erotic? I am getting so sick of some of the newer horror ""novelists"" writing absurdaties that I would expect to find in the Penthouse forum!! Half of this book is like a peak into the mind of 14 year old boy who can only think about girls but has no experience with them. Coincidence? I wonder...If you feel you just have to read this abomination, do yourself a favor and look for it in a used bookstore. I garantee you'll find plenty of copies that were only read up to page 50 or less!"
3,What did you expect???,"Come on, everyone. The book is called, ""The Backwoods"". What did you expect? I'm sure Lee blazed through writing this in a matter of weeks -- it has all the standard Lee stuff -- rapes, sex, violent deaths, sex, ridiculous gore, sex, torture, and sex. Look, every few months or so I need my fix of Edward Lee to purge my system. This book worked for me. I had a smile on my face thinking how much fun Edward had writing this. I laughed out loud many times at some of his sexual descriptions. He's not trying to win any awards here. Lighten up. Sure, it's mostly immature, but boy I had a good time."
2,Just not good,"I had been wanting to read Ed Lee for a while now based on reviews of his previous books and various snippets i'd read along the way. Now i find myself wondering if i will ever read anything else by him ever again. This book simply was not good. It sounded amateurish. The whole thing was rather trite. It was as if someone took a bad romance novelist and gave him a subject and a list of required gore and horror and sat him in front of a computer. And the dialogue, ohh god the dialogue! Bad dialogue will kill a book faster than anything else. I gave it two stars only because i like books that are not afraid to be frank about sex and gore. Otherwise, i consider this book wasted time both on my part and the author's."
4,Good and creepy!,"I'm a huge Richard Laymon fan, and this book was recommended to me by some folks on his website. I was suprised at how much I enjoyed it, and at just how much it remided me of Richard's work. It's very graphic and gorey, and has some hot sex scenes as well. The storyline is creepy and will make you want to see what happens next, and who is involved. I recommend this one for anyone who enjoys a good horror novel with blood and gore. I liked it so much I've ordered a few more of his novels."
1,Does not work ;-(,I am so disappointed in the product. I believed all the reviews. We have a long-haired dog and it takes a vacuum attachment to remove the hair. This product would have worked wonderful... if it worked. I tried it on our couch and on our bedspread. It moved the hair into a big clump or got all static and stuck to the sponge. If anyone has any tips please comment. I'm not returning it because it was so cheap it's not worth the time or effort.
2,Doesn't work on smooth surfaces,"This product is not very satisfactory. I purchased it with the intent to wipe down my leather couch; however, the cat hair does not stick to it very much. I get better results by using a wet paper towel. I have not tried it on fabric, carpet or rugs, but it does not work for relatively smooth surfaces like leather or wood furniture."
2,nice design - poooor sound quality,"I like the design of these headphones. They are light and seem to be stable, they're fitting tight but not too much.The sound: Well, I don't really know what to expect from headphones in this price-range but so far I am pretty disappointed by their sound quality.The base is strong but ways too present and dull hammering like a layer on top of the music.The mid-range is very week and even doesn't come out nicely when try to ""equalize"" - andthe highs jingle annoying somewhere far away instead of giving the ""sound cocktail"" the right freshness.All in all a these headphones have dull and non detailed sound that constantly gives me the feeling i want to remove that pillow that is between my ears and the headphones.. ..so where is it? Must be somewhere! Hey, maybe I forgot to remove the Q-tips this morning ..?!By the way: tested on two computers and one good hi-fi system."
1,Drink a lot of coffee to stay awake.,"Boring, Boring, Boring. This woman did not want to do this DVD. She seems to be half asleep most of the time. Nice to have a DVD on this subject (riding a bike and letting us see) but someone who wants to be on the bike would be nice."
1,Some Kind of Stupid,"Wow...that was by far the worst video I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong it has absolutely ZERO educational and informational value, but it is the funniest thing I have ever seen. I haven't laughed so hard in my life. Keep cranking out more! I'll just check them out at the library after a hard day."
1,The worst movie I have ever seen.,the dvd is of poor quality. the movie is very blury. the actors and unprofessional. the plot sucks.
1,"Chosen One, The Ledgend of The Raven","I wasn't expecting a theatrical master piece, but this one leaves a lot to be desired. Some very lovely ladies, but not enough shots of them to cover for the bad plot. I saw this on DVD, and didn't like the format. You couldn't go straight to ""PLAY"". I also couldn't get rid of the Directors commentary with the first section. I finally got rid of it by the second, and I don't have this problem with other DVD's I own. (on the other one's I own, you have to chose that option, it doesn't automatically come on, though there may be a flaw in my copy) As for the plot, it was basically rehashed ideas from hundreds of other B movies, except this one was more vague. I did like the all womens costumes though."
1,Don't waste your time and money.,Even as beautiful and sexy as Carmen Electra is she can't save this dud. They don't show her enough or enough of her to make it worth watching.
4,Very Good,This movie is exelent.. Carmen Elektra was beatifull and sexy.. I recommend this movie for every people likes Action and sexy woman ATT: andman
1,Only thing good was carmen.,First they have a cheesey story of a girl coming home to her sister's funeral and finding out that she is the new raven or something then she doesnt want to be a raven and she has sex with some guy who we dont even know and another guy gets mad and finally carmen decides to become the raven and wears a corney outfit and kicks some butt.
1,I was really disappointed,"I was really psyched to see this movie. I was hoping to see a Carmen Electra sex fest. Boy was I let down. There is only one scene where Carmen was in action, and that wasn't even any good. The scene was like a music video with a bunch of rapid cuts and closeups. I don't know if it's me, but i like a lot of wide shots with very little cuts. The reason I don't say this movie deserves zero stars is because there's this one hot scene in the movie where Carmen pours milk down her body. But if you're looking to see Carmen naked throughout the majority of the movie, prepared to be disappointed."
1,This is not a movie,"Honestly, I rented this hoping to have some good material to watch while I was playing with myself. I was thoroughly disappointed. Most MTV videos have better plot and acting. But nobody rents this sort of movie even for the cheese value; final analysis--Carmen Electra is nicely round, but she's horribly photographed and blurry."
2,A lame disappointment...,"Much of the plot didn't make sense, and the acting was B- at best. Thus, one was hoping for a little more female display that frankly never materialized. With several hot chicks, there's only one scene of any consequence and that's with Carmen who's beautiful face and overall figure is frankly diminished by an apparently stiff set of implants. But, that's the world these days. So, if you're a Carmen Electra fan, it's still a good addition to your video library."
3,"Excellent Sound, Menus, Women",The sound on the DVD is excellent as well as the selection menus. Not to mention Carmen Electra...
3,The Female Crow,"For fans of the cult classic, The Crow, its femme fatale counterpart has arrived! This movie is as cheesy as superhero movies come, but the fact that it was made in 1998 and features its title character in scantily clad superhero apparel (sans cape) as well as an uncomfortable-looking steel mask makes this movie a favorite among comic book geeks. It's so similar to Brandon Lee's swan song that it basically has the same typeface, and 'raven' is in the title, so both movies got the bird theme going on. The scene where she walks into the bar definitely screams ""I'm here, bitch!"" It's nice to know that a sexy vixen like Carmen Electra can kick ass and take names, all while looking good at the same time."
5,Play it again...,"I preordered this album before it's release date-taking a huge gamble. But I should have known Jimmy wouldn't let me down. The blend of country and carribean is refreshing to loyal Parrotheads and introduces the country flock into the world they've been missing. Some may say this album isn't typical Buffett. Well, I would hope that an aging Jimmy with a grown daughter wouldn't be stealing peanut butter or scarfing down boat drinks anymore. This album reflects what Jimmy has become: a well-traveled, experienced musician. A mature, must-own album for dedicated fans and appreciators of timeless music. If this helps, it hasn't left my cd player for two weeks, and I'm not tired of it yet."
5,Just chillin',Have almost worn out this CD. Really great duets PLUS! Particularly with Martina McBride. Takes me on a vacation every time I listen to it.
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"At first, I was a little skeptical about this effort. I'm more a parrot head/dead head (dead parrot head?)than a red neck but this album comes through. The cover of ""Scarlet Begonias"" is my personal favorite, (that's the dead head in me) but ""Coastal Confessions"", ""Piece of Work"", ""Conky Tonkin"", and even ""License to Chill"" have me moving around the house. I skip the slow mournful country ballads because that's not my thing but how many albums can you pick up where you like 80% of the songs? Oh, and ""Simply Complicated"" won't get air play but is right in there with ""A Love Song (from a slightly different point of view)""."
1,License to Puke,"Oh, that's my boy Buffett, appealing to every simpleton humanoid that grazes Wal-Marts and Old Country Buffets across the rapidly dumbing down nation of America. How about some real songs like ""Git R Done,"" ""I Ain't Got No Educashun, I'm Street Smart"" and ""There Goes My Trailer, Been Done Repo'd By The Bank!""Wal-Mart, Reality TV, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Jimmy Buffett, Larry the Cable Guy - the white trashing of America continues..."
3,Follow the money....,"OK, I stumble upon a number 1 country hit, get some kind of hayseed award (finally). Hmmm... I bet I can convince my fans that this is the real Jimmy. Country album, here we go! I'll mention in the liner notes that I've actually been a country singer all this time, and Boat Drinks was just a bluff to keep my cover - they'll buy it - they always do. Plus I'll rake in millions from the country music crowd. Now, how can I get this done with as little creative effort as possible? Hmmm..... I know! - I'll pull a Sinatra-esque move and mail it in with a bunch of duet covers. If the Parrot Heads fall for this, I'm going to send an animatronic Jimmy on tour next year, 'cause I know they ain't payin' attention!Life's easy when the cash flows, isn't it Jimmy?"
1,WOW!! THIS SUCKED!!!,"What was Jimmy thinking? Caribbean meets country, are you kidding me? What a horrible idea, that shouldn't have even made it too cd. I think the boat left and Jimmy wasn't on it this time. Can the music industry produce anything worthwile?"
4,Love it! But it takes a bit of getting use to.,"I rated this with four stars because the music does sound like the normal,tropical sounding music that he writes. For instance he took, I took off for a weekend last month just to try to recall the whole year,All of the faces all of the places wonderin' where they all disapear.(that changes in latitude changes in attitude)Into LICSENSE TO CHILL!!Ps. I am a kid"
5,Fabulous!,"This is such a great album. Since I'm a country fan and a Jimmy Buffet fan, it's an excellent combination. Even if you don't care for country or Jimmy Buffet, this album is so worth a listen. He truly has hit the mark with this one.The best on the album and it's a hard one to pick, but the duet with Martina McBride - ""Trip Around the Sun"" takes my breath away.This album is fun with duets from Kenny Chesney, Toby Keith, & Clint Black. His duet with Alan Jackson, ""Boats to Build"" and ""Sea of Heartbreak"" with George Strait are fantastic.""Simply Complicated"" and ""Coastal Confessions"" are typical Jimmy Buffet and fun to listen to.Go out and buy it. It's worth it."
3,Barefooted on the album cover again! A Jimmy trademark!,I don't think since the 70s has Jimmy Buffett appeared barefooted on an album cover. His toenails were too long on the last one. (funny!) This is back to his more fun image as opposed to the conservative image he's done for some four albums. Like the approach to country since Alan Jackson and Kenny Chesney bawl about him in their interviews about him being a musical influence. I think this album will do well on the country end.
4,Chill Is A Thrill,"Jimmy Buffett started out as a country singer-songwriter. His first several releases were strong country-rock records. In 2003, Mr. Buffett dueted with Alan Jackson on countrified ""It's Five O'Clock Somewhere"" and the results were Mr. Buffett's first number one record as the song topped the Country charts. For Licensed To Chill, Mr. Buffett again duets with Mr. Jackson as well as several other notable country stars like Kenny Chesney, George Strait, Toby Keith and Martina McBride. The results are a pleasant mixing of country and parrothead rock. The album's best track is his lone duet with a non-country performer, Bill Withers, ""Playin' The Loser Again"" which finds Mr. Buffett holding his own with the powerful Mr. withers and sounding quite soulful. Licensed To Chill is yet another solid album that will keep Parrotheads happy until Mr. Buffett's next release."
2,Sad Ending To A Great Career,"I can't help but agree with the other reviewers that say that this CD is nothing more than a crass commercial ploy by Buffett to get his hands on some of that Country Music scene money and is, in a word, crap. I also admit that Liz O'Connor and Bill Jabanoski's CDs are much better than anything Jimmy has done in years and years. However, they are both much younger performers with fresh ideas and Jimmy was even better then them when he was their age. It's just another case of the changing of the guard. Yes Jimmy, it is time to stop making a fool out of yourself and head out to pasture, but thanks for all the great music and memories."
2,"I'm with ""Runningman""","Absolutely agree with ""Runningmans"" comments here. Give me my five disc changer with three old pre ""Banana Wind"" Buffett Cds, and for new, fun great tropical music Bill Jabanoski's ""Key West Party CD"" and Liz O'Connor's ""Legacy."" Now you've got a party going! As for this disc, If you haven't all ready wasted your money on it, save it. Almost no fun to be had here at all."
1,Good Buffett duets,"Although i am not a hugh country music fan,this album is a good listen very well done nice songs"
1,Sold out! Pure modern commercialisim.,"Save your money!!! This review will go against the current popular trend. (Since when have popular trends been right).I tried to like it, but it just not possible. Even the track with Bill Withers is bad.I was hoping that it would be a good blend/mix with the country folks. But alas, it is a poor commercial project. Sold out for commercialisim! I much very wanted to find one positive thing to say about this CD, but I can't. I think Mr. buffet is above, far above, a work like this. Sorry Jimmy, I know it is selling well. You can do better.I hope I can get my money back!I DID GET MY MONEY BACK!!"
1,Not received,"I still have not received this item. It needs to be usps to Becky FreemanP O Box 170 Hanceville, Al 35077"
2,Ok,while most of Jimmy Buffett's Material at times seems geared Better if you are drunk he actually sounds alright on a few tracks here. now granted a few tracks don't move me at all but He does Ok.interesting Collabs with Bill Withers amongest others.
1,License to Kill ...,A twenty dollar bill. Can think of better ways to spend my hard earned cash. The Buffetts (both Warren and Jimmy) have enough. Time for Jimmy to sail away into the sunset. This CD should be his last ... here's hopin'
1,Livingston's gone to Nashville,"This duets album makes more sense if you loved James William in the 1970s Gulf & Western days of A1A, Living and Dying in 3/4 time. This time out, there is far more Hank Williams than Xavier Cougat. But I laughed out loud more than once, especially at his coastline confessions reference to stealing peanut butter. This record will make Buffett a bigger star than he was, drawing the country crowd. And no form of music can break the heart quite like C&W. I wish the liner notes had been more explicit about who wrote what. Sonny Landreth burns rubber with his zydecholdsmobile guitar work. As a long-time fan, I'm completely happy. Thanks, Jimmy."
4,Back to the...good stuff,"Finally...a great ""piece of work"" by Mr. Jimmy! I was very surprised to hear this new album. Despite being a long time Parrothead, I'll admit his last couple albums have been terrible (come on, Math Sucks?!?). I was almost reluctant to buy this new one with fear that it too would be a dust collector. However, I can honestly say that this is his first album since Fruitcakes that really makes me want to listen again and again. I must admit this album has its lower point (e.g. Conky Tonkin), but overall the album is an excellent listen. I think the combination of artists and vocal blends (e.g. Martina McBride's Trip Around The Sun) are a wonderful tribute to a man who has stood the test of musical time. I'm hooked on Window On The World, Boats To Build, and the cover of the Dead's Scarlet Begonias. In summary in his own words...""Country, Pop, Rock 'n Roll, I know they are related"". Good to see he's back!"
5,Awesome!,Definitely glad I purchased this CD! Great music! Received my CD before I left in vacation so that was good!
