4,Poems of many voices in Genesis,"A good poem may take the reader to a different time, or may bring a character from a different time to the present. Azriel's best poems do both. Starting with the creation ""Do you wish to know how light, can find a voice and sing"", many of the Genesis stories are included. By giving a modern voice to ""Ancient"" names, we can begin to understand how they feel, or give new perspectives to events in our own time. For example in 'Question for Eve"", ""In the camps / In the predawn Polish cold? / You cloth yourself in the luxury of fig leaves ...."" A poet picks what stores to include, and here there is even a poem about Zebulum (Jacob and Leahs 6th son). Voice is given to many of the important women, ""My Dinah"" gives voices to the family after the rape of Dinah. It us surprising to me that some of Genesis richer stores like the Binding of Isaac or Jacob's wrestling in the night are not further explored."
1,Strident playing and horrible squeaking,"This is as poor a classical guitar cd as I have ever heard. The playing is tinny and strident with no dynamic nuances at all. The squeaking of fingers on strings, present and tolerable in most classical guitar recordings, is here continuous and unbearable. I warn you away from this one."
2,"Illustrations are beautiful, but grammar is not","The illustrations in this children's book are beautiful; the story appeals to all children; however, the use of incorrect grammar detracts from both the story and the illustrations. It is possible for children to use standard English if that is what they are exposed to in literature and in life. I was very disappointed in the use of grammar by the narrator and by the characters in the story."
2,Unorganized and badly photographed,"I own this book and wish I hadn't bought it. It is basically just a collection of pictures of pretty colored insulators, with prices. There is NO ORGANIZATION WHATSOEVER!The insulators are not arranged by color, manufacturer, style, age, embossing, or anything else! It's completely random-- and there is NO INDEX so there's no way to find a particular piece except to page through it. This is very, very bad-- I've never seen a randomly arranged, indexless reference book before. That's because it's not a reference book, not a ""guide""-- it's just eye candy.Which might be OK, but the photography is not good! The colors are not accurate-- often they are too saturated-- and the shots were up taken from far too close so the insulators all suffer from major barrel distortion.Definitely do not recommend this book."
4,The Definitive Guide to Colorful Insulators,Wonderful photographs and extremely informative. The book itself is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection! Highly recommend!
5,Insulators,"Great book, tells a lot about insulators. Most people don't know what insulators are. For a collector it has a lot of information and shows a lot of different insulators. I bought it so my grandchildren would know what their grandmother collected and why."
2,Underwhelmed,"I did a lot of research before buying the Falcon 2, as this is to be part of our competition at deer camp. I am disappointed.First thing you notice is the cheap plastic webbing that rests against your arm. It's functional, but won't hold up for long. The second problem is the pouch...made of plastic and will tear apart before you get 100 shots off. For some reason, misfires are common as the 3/8 steel shot will drop at about 20-30 feet, yet occasionally sail straight at high velocity and hit a pie plate at 90 feet, no idea why this happens. The flat bands are good for velocity however, you have a tangled mess after each shot. What the pictures don't show you is that there's actually 2 bands on each side, so if getting off a second shot in a hurry is important, forget about it. The frame is well made and disassembles without tools. The band snaps are fine but you can't use tubular bands should you wish to replace them, and you will."
2,pouch breaks easily if you use rocks,"I bought 2 Falcons and one unit was faulty because one of the rocker pieces that holds the bands in place did not work. The lock kept coming apart.The second unit was fun for about 5 shots but then the pouch broke. We were using rocks (you're only supposed to use purchased round shot). The pouches are plastic with a slit so they seem prone to breakage.I am going to try a different model, because they did seem to shoot well before they broke. I would NOT recommend this Falcon 2 model."
5,Excellent product,Fantastic product - it's performed flawlessly on several dives - all camera operations are easily accessed underwater and it takes great pictures above water using this housing as well. I wish I had bought it sooner!
4,Great product!!!.....needs a lens cap,"I have used this item many times in the snow. Dropped, fell, and have gotten it completely covered by snow. It is a must buy for the sony cameras. The only complaint is that it needs a lens cap! If the lens gets scratched at all, your screwed! $130.00 down the drain. I have called sony and tried to see if they had an alternative that would work with the size of this lens....no luck.Great product, get it, you'll need it. But be carefull of the lens!"
1,?,"IT WAS BROKEN, WHEN WE OPENED IT TOOK EVERYTHING OUT OF THE PACKAGE AND THREW AWAY THE PACKAGING ON XMAS MORNING SO COULDN'T RETURN IT. THE HAND HELD CONTROLLER WAS WHAT WAS BROKE"
3,Not a great read...,"I was hoping this book was going to be a ""tell all"" type of book, but it wasn't. Maybe I had a James Bond kind of impression of spy's and if that is what you are expecting, Victor Cherkashin is not. It is well written, but not the page turner I was hoping for, also repetitive at times."
2,"Fun snippets, but hard to follow","This book contains lots of stories about life within the KGB, from office politics to counterintelligence operations, but it comes off as a series of short stories that often end abruptly or suddenly switch to something different. It leaves me with a lot of information but not feeling like I've read a good narrative."
4,Cold War Espionage Uncovered,"Spy handler is an inside look at how the Russians engaged in Cold War espionage, and how luck and skill were equally important in trying to outwit their adversaries. It shows how spies were recruited and how some volunteered, and the lenghts taken to figure out if they were legitimate or indeed double or even triple agents. Anyone who has read any of the books on either Aldrich Ames or Robert Hannsen should consider this book a must read."
5,Spy Handler: Memoir of a KGB Officer- The True Story of the Man Who...,"Excellent Quality, Timely Receipt, Excellent Price. Will definitely use again and recommend to associates.Dr. John N. Parrigin, CPP, CFE"
5,Excellent Read,"This book gives one an insight into the workings of the ""evil empire's"" KGB intelligence apparatus.It is fascinating to discover that both major superpowers had and probably still have, very similar spy tactics.."
4,I liked the book but I felt subtitle was incorrect,"I have read the two widely praised books on both Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen. Reading the author's side was very interesting especially his story about who really turned in John Walker. He claims it was on one of the Russian spies later revealed to the KGB by both Ames and Hanssen. Widely held reported story is that Walker's ex-wife did it.My only problems with the book: Its seemly almost exact re-telling of information from other books on both Ames and Hanssen. Its subtitle claiming that the author ""recruited"" both men. Not true. It is well known that Ames literally walked into the Russian embassy in Washington offering his services, and Hanssen mailed a back to the home of an Russian embassy worker which contained another package specifially addressed to the author while he was a KGB officer at the embassy. He did not recruit them. Welcomed them, yes. But he didn't recruit them."
3,Handling Spy Handler,"I find this book very interesting as it relates to the infamous American spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hansson. However, I find the details can be cumbersome at times even though it is written with obvious knowledge. All in all, if one is interested in the dark world of spying, it is a good read."
4,interesting perspective,"The thing I enjoyed the most about this book was that it was written by a Russian and therefore approached spycraft from a unique vantage point relative to what you would find with an American author. It reads like more of a history book than a thriller but is informative and intriguing all the same. If you are looking for an excellent book about the famous spy cases of the 1970s and 1980s, I would reco Spy by David Wise (re: Hansen case) or Spy Hunter by Robert Hunter (re: Walker case)."
4,Viktor Cherkashin lets us know the Soviet side of the story ...,"Fascinating history of espionage activities by the KGB against the United States in the Cold War. Focuses on the Hanssen and Ames cases and with Soviet counterintelligence activities and methods.When paired with Milt Bearden's book ""The Main Enemy"", it provides a pretty comprehensive behind the scenes look at US v Soviet intelligence activities though the latter half of the Cold War.One of the things I found curious about both books is the polite, almost fraternal, way in which these intelligence professionals write about the other side. I doubt that any of the histories to come from post Soviet Russia, or Iran, or Syria or Saudi Arabia or Egypt, maybe even Israel will have the same collegial tone."
3,Interesting but scattered,"Getting an insiders view of spying throughout the past 40 years was interesting - Cherkashin's accounts of cold war spy vs spy tactics are personal and credible. I found especially interesting his stories of high tensions within the USSR during the Reagan 80's, and his perception of the Russian weaknesses that caused the fall of the wall throughout Europe. The quotes and stories from US intelligence agents were good.I was disappointed the writings seemed very scattered. Cherkashin sounds like he had a big chip on his shoulder about his government. Not one of my favorite reads."
5,AMAZING CLEAVER!!!,The product is better than expected. It is very sharp and concise. Its gonna be my all-purpose knife.
5,Awesome!,"It's always great when the best product is also the least expensive! SUPER happy with this cleaver. I use it to open young thai coconuts, and it works amazingly. Thank you! =)"
1,bad copy,the bluray keeps skipping through out the movies.awlful!!! Waste of money. Should have went with another vendor. Don't buy
3,A good impression for the first time,"Synthpop more than Electro, that's it!, 3 girls from England are the artis for this record, and I must say not bad at all!. This was the first time I listened to CLIENT, I decided to get this CD because of 2 main reasons and intuition:1)It was really cheap and the CD Store2)the front cover looked attractive...(and I can say I don't regret it!).Yes, it's a good CD (rated with 3 stars) with a couple of great good dance-floor songs (my fave one: ""lights go out"") but also with some depeches-que influence. In summary, this is not avant garde music for all the people who are hard electronic fans, however you will enjoy if just for your lisntening pleaseure..."
4,Good comedy entry in Dead End Kids series,"But the only problem as I see it is there is hardly any even bogus supernatural elwment (despite Dracula--Bela Lugosi--being in it). All the boys do while in the house is hear a few noises and see someone stand in a picture frame. Their first entry with Lugosi (Spooks Run Wild) was a much better entry for the horror-comedy genre. This is a great, entertaining film but it has little to do with horror. Ghost and Mr. Chcken it ain't!"
1,Soooo Boring,"Bought this at at Half Price Books for $4.99. Not a bargin. With the reviews from Amazon I expected a little more. ""Hold That Ghost"" is basically the same movie with more laughs and mystery."
1,She needs to do research,"Have not finished the book yet, and may never. She has already made so many mistakes, it is terrible. Granted she knows a lot about cutting, and the bloodlines, but fails sorrowfully on basic horse knowledge. 30 years of raising, breeding, and training horses gives me a basis of knowledge. For me, her glaring mistakes ruin the book."
4,Great first book..,I enjoyed this book by Laura Crum and look forward to readingthe others. The main character is very independent and the storyresolves around horses and a good mystery. Another favorite to add tomy list!
4,Fun to read,This was a fun read with lots of twists and turns. I enjoyed the story line and having lived in Aptos ( near Santa Cruz) I really enjoyed all the references to the area. The horse/vet information intertwined with the plot made for a unique comnon thread to connect all the characters.
2,Hard Drive Eater,"My Grandson, age 6, didn't like the load time, nor the grapics, and the slow loading and game resonse.Beware this game claims to use 120 megabytes of your harddrive...That is just to load the game. After you play it a couple times (5x for my spawn) it creeps up exponentially! I removed it when it hit 5,419 MB. That's 5 gigabytes out of my 13 gig harddrive. Most games average 500 mb (ie spongebob,harry potter,etc. I could fit 11 of those games on this computer. The graphics are sickly compared to tying up resources."
1,"Why not PS2, why not GameCube? Why only PC?","If the site is telling the truth, Spy Kids 3: Game Over is only being sold on Game Boy Advance (GIVE ME A BREAK!) and PC (THE SLOWEST WAY TO PLAY!) If the game keeps true to the movie's plot line (which it should because it has been licensed over to Disney but look what happened with the Toy Story games!) You should be able to play as Juni in his search to find his sister in a game suitably titled ""GAME OVER"". I don't like playing PC games, while they are cheaper than console versions, the slow processors make the game slow. I just hop Disney decides to release it at least on PS2 or GameCube (seeing how I only have those two systems) because I would really like to play this. For those in the know, this should sort of play like the game .HACK//Infection Part 1 which is now on PS2 (IT IS A GREAT GAME!) you play a video game about a video game. Anyway, DISNEY READ THIS AND HEED!"
1,very disappointing a true life waster,"Well I had high expectations for this considering it's based on(Dr.) Tezuka Osamu's famous Black Jack. Unfortunately it's in name only. There is a story in there but it's rather silly and overly dramatic. Apart from the young girl none of the characters are interesting. They even managed to make black jack boring. And how long did they want to make this....ITS SOOOO LONG. I watched this with some Japanese friends and even they were bored witless. i can not recommend this dvd. choose something else. this is just too boring and silly. The only reason i finished watching this (unlike spriggan) is because I was watching it with people. I couldn't stop looking at the time counting by second by second.sometimes it's good to watch bad movies so you can compare and build up a sense of judgment. but not in this case. this isn't bad, just really really boring."
5,The title name is not original but the movie is great,"When I first saw the preview of this anime on my Macross 2 movie, I gotta say if it was good enough for me to get, and yes it was. But after buying it on DVD. I really say it's the best anime to see, and it was created by Osamu Tezuka, the godfather of anime. I know that this was one of his greatest masterpiece since ""Astro Boy and Kimba: The White Lion"". I do like the animation in this film, and Kirk Thornton playing the voice of Black Jack. Some scenes are too bloody and scary for kids."
1,Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This,"Where to begin! There's barely a hint of plot, absolutely no character development, no sense of danger or tension and the whole thing is based on a completely ridiculous premise. I guess you could say it's at least drawn well, but some of the stylistic choices are just stupid looking (a plethora of cheesy freeze frames and an overuse of an infrared effect to bash the viewer over the head with ""hey look, this guy is a 'super mankind' person!"") And, my gawd, it ends with a literal lecture that is screamed at the audience. After about 20 minutes of this tripe you'll be wishing you spent your money on a house call from Dr. Kevorkian."
4,A fantastic book from a fantastic author,"I own all the amazing books written by Richard Parks and was fortunate enough to meet him at a dinner where he kindly autographed them all. Can't wait to read the latest! I feel certain this book will be as good as the others, so I've pre-ordered two copies; one to keep nice on the shelf and one to ""read the words off of."""
2,advert..?,"Technical content of this film is okay, the claims it makes seem reasonable, I've used EOs with some benefit for cleaning the air in my home.I give a low review because this film is in essence an advert for Young's Living Essential Oils + Diffusers (any EO could do the job). I also drop a star in that the price relative to the hotel conference room with a camcorder production quality didn't seem to line up in my mind."
5,Toxic Mold by Dr. Close,"Toxic Mold: A Breakthrough Discovery - Video, is an excellent resource for any family to have on their shelf. Dr. Close teaches how to understnd the makeup of mold, dangers of mold in the home, how mold spores spread, the myths about killing mold with bleach and other harsh chemicals. Dr. Close offers a simple solution and he has the research and facts to back it up. We had mold in our home from a water leak, and the product, Thieves Essential oil and other associated Thieves products, applied in a certain manner, got rid of the toxic mold in our home, and it smells so fresh and clean, too! After learning secrets about mold, the Thieves oil can be useful as a therapeutic agent to ward off illness. Thanks to Dr. Close for his research and for making this video to share!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!!,"Beware if you find this boot on sale for ridicuously cheap! Amazon will suddenly have NONE in stock, then eventually CANCEL your order!!!"
3,A peek at an enigma,"J. Robert Oppenheimer was better at keeping himself hidden than most people, and you won't learn a lot about him from these letters, but it does a give a rare, patial glimpse of a very mysterious person."
3,Ceci n'est pas une pipe!,"Still, beats the heck out of Red Vines.Might encourage youthful smoking, though. Hmm, tough call."
5,Easy,Easy to install and works great. Fixed the problem we were having. The extra rollers are good to have on hand because they get used up faster.
4,Read it All!!,"I had a bit of a tough time starting out, but once I got into it I loved it! Lots of detail and a wonderful opportunity to learn more about a sport, or should I say lifestyle, I know nothing about. I encourage you to get this book!"
5,Enthralling!!,"This book is very intense and becomes personal. While reading this book, you become involved in the life of Nathan and his women. Plus - you meet the hunter. He is definitely a ""sick ticket"". I lost sleep trying to keep reading and reading! You will feel the need to know what is going to happen next. (It is not a book for children or even young teens to read.)I highly recommend this book!!! glg"
3,Butter melting pan,"Picture and description was deceiving. Shape of the pot is oval, which did not help to my purpose. Order came after reasonable time."
5,So good it could stop time,"Why must you French musicians torture me with your haunting, dark experimental, genius music? This is a genuine start to finish album. Take it from the top. Sometimes so simple other times a weird, deranged, water damaged, symphonic road trip. If you want to be put in a mood, what one, you decide, there are a lot to chose from here, then get this. I've got to stop listening to music it's too much sometimes"
3,For those with open ears,"this is a treat. It is indeed as frustrating as some of the other reviews have stated, but for the musically adventerous that is half the fun. I have been waiting for a full length from this man since his appearance on the last SourceLab compilation and I am both equally disappointed and thrilled by it. It is truly meloncholic music that bursts into the most uncomfortable sounds at the most inappropriate times, keeping it from being as beautiful as it could be. But, I think, that is the point, and once you get that you can explore this quirky album in all its richness and glory. If you like where Air went with some of their darker and bizarre sounds on Virgin Suicides then get this immediately. Listen to it carefully and you will ultimately not be diappointed. Also, I would give this 3 and a half stars, but I can't."
3,Bonkers!,"I also saw the rather obscure Sebastian Tellier recently at Air's gig in Berlin. Not really sure how well the music works live but I can definitely say that it was rather original to say the least. As we didn't know what the odd radiowave instrument thing was, we actually thought his lady friend was playing something invisible! And when she screamed at the end of one song we thought she had lost the plot."
3,Awkward originality,"This music is initially breathtaking in its inventiveness. The majority of the tunes are written very hypnotically, with very few melodic surprises throughout the repetative sonic droll. Despite this freshness, the music eventually suffers from an overuse of too-similar instrumentation and uninspired vocals. Fans of this chatoic and experimental genre should look to groups like 'Melt Banana' for a better example of linear song-writing. Eliminate several songs here, and it's a winner."
1,I thought it was the playwrite,"I ordered it and I found it is just the playbill, which I've already got one as I entered the theature in New York City. In case the real playwrite it out, somebody please kindly tell me where to find it. :)"
1,Important Misinformation,"The item offered, by Target, was in fact the Kyocera ceramic grater in the size Kyocera calls medium. There is no large. I assumed this was a real large, because the price was significantly more than that charged for a medium by any other vendor. So, the product, nice as I'm sure it would have been, was misrepresented by Target, and they overcharged for it. Clearly, when I saw what it was, I returned it. Target charged about $31, and about $8 S&H. Most other vendors charge about $25. I have seen this item for as low as $17.50"
1,"BEST SONG, WORST ALBUM","I may be just another Pop Guy, but the only song I can listen to on this album is TORN. The good news is that TORN is my SONG OF THE YEAR. If my CD were vinyl, track #1 would be worn out. The rest of the songs are too mixed. It can't be smoothly LISTENED to; it has to be FOUGHT through. I prefer each album to have its own style, its own rhythm. Love Alanis, Love Natalie Merchant; just can't enjoy Imbruglia's unsettled and uncertain approach. I should have bought the single! One good song; one star!"
2,This CD gets REALLY old.,"I'll admit it, I bought into the Natalie Imbruglia craze two years ago, and defended this CD to the death. I just played the album again in the first time for over a year and I'm really surprised how dated the melodies already sound. The problem isn't really with the melodies, which I guess are fine for the most part, but the production mixed with Natalie's singing voice and wannabe-poetic lyrics makes almost every song sound awkward and overproduced. Beneath the dancebeats and gimmicks of ""Torn"" and ""Wishing I Was There"" are some pretty good melodies, but it's really hard to notice when you're being cast into 1998 chick-pop Lilith Fair America. ""Smoke"" and ""Pigeons and Crumbs"" are brilliant ballads, however (especially the latter), and I'll stand up for them any day. The rest of this album...eh..."
2,There's a Reason She Faded Away,"Natalie Imbruglia had a big hit a few years back with ""Torn,"" and then we didn't hear from her much.Listen to this CD, and you'll see why.""Torn"" is the only really good, standout track on the whole thing."
2,It's okay but.....,"It's overall an OK cd to listen to. You got ""Torn"" of course, the pop radio-friendly little that all the bubblegum boys and girls will enjoy. BUT unfortunatly it's not all thanks to Natalie. She obviously worked with some of the best writers around to create this CD. Her mega hit TORN wasn't even co-written by her. And I get suspisous when she only co-writes songs, and thats with the help of about 3 or 4 others. While she may have a pretty voice, it is way to overproduced. Seeing Natilie live is SO much better than listening to this album because it is SO OVER PRODUCED. Songs like ""Smoke"" for example, would sounds absolutly beautiful with nothing but a piano accompanying her, but it is bogged down by horrid voice effects, computer beep beeps and stuff. Her pretty voice is constantly being destroyed by production. Go buy Jewels new album, it's amazing, a beautiful, clear, pure voice on that one. :) Or, you could buy yourself a Live Natalie bootleg CD."
3,It's worth getting,"Though some of the songs seem to be lacking, TORN makes up for it all. It's really worth getting."
4,It grows on you,"Natalie didn't write any of the songs all by herself and the lyrics are sometimes corny and meaningless, sometimes deeply soul-searching. (""Where are you dad, mum's looking sad""-- ""Smoke"") Before you know it, you'll find yourself humming the tunes in your spare time and running home to play the disc again and again. In fact, the more you listen to it, the more you find yourself drawn to it-- the lyrics, the beat, and her slightly whiny voice. Try not to turn a deaf ear after the first listen-- a CD like this one requires extra chances to work its magic on you. In the end, you become her biggest fan."
5,VERY GOOD!!!,"Her music is great! I love all the songs. My 2 favorites are ""Smoke"" and ""Leave Me Alone"". ""Smoke"" is the most beautiful song I've ever heard by a female artist.-Candy aka Megan B.L., the Cheesegirl"
4,Can complement everyone's musical palette,"It almost feels like listening to a collaboration CD when you listen to ""Left of the Middle"". It starts off with ""Torn"", stuff adult contemporary stations live off of. But as you go through, you'll find the potential club classic ""Impressed"", the hard rock track ""Big Mistake"", and the dark songs like ""Smoke"" and ""City"". All of these songs are great, but it tells us little of Natalie herself. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe she's a pioneer for artists who don't limit themselves by genre. Let's hope her upcoming album will continue with more of the same."
5,"I bought the CD a year ago and, and it's still my favourite!","Listen, if you want to listen to music that you wont find anywhere else, you really should get this CD. It is TOP NOTCH! I bought this CD a year ago and I still listen to it more than I do all my other CDs, including the 15 that I have bought since then. Natalie Imbruglia is more than just a new artist, she is THE ARTIST (pun definitely NOT intended)!!! Infact, everyday when I get on the computer, I pop in her CD and listen for hours. It is fantastic!! But, if you do buy this album, go for the Australian version, it contains 5 more songs. Oh, and I can guarantee you that you will LOVE her song ""Smoke."" It it only famous in the UK but once you hear it once, you wont be able to get enough if it!! I just wish people realized that she was more than just a one-hit wonder with the song ""Torn."" It is NOTHING compared to her other songs!!"
3,OK...,"This CD is totally ok, but not much more. It has some good songs, but I can't help feeling that she's trying to be Alanis Morissette -without succeding. I would suggest you buy Alanis Morissette instead, her songs feel much more honest and real. But still.. if you love ""Torn"" you'll probably like the whole album."
3,stop making a comparison to other female artists,"natalie imbruglia, like every other artist has taken the music she loves to listen to and twisted it into her own interpretation- what's the big deal! she is not the newest ""alannis Morissette"" nor ... whoever she has been described as copying. however she does her thing with a style and flair that is unique and very much an imbruglia seasoning. i congratulate her for making a success out of her career and for the international recognition she has received for her work. it's not my personal favourite but i recommend to everyone to have a listen and learn something!"
2,Is this her demo tape?,"Why didn't they hire a qualified producer if they really wanted to promote this Australian girl and make her a superstar? The sound is bad, the instrumentation is poor, and the songs lack originality (not only the known Torn which was taken, without bothering to inform the public about its roots, from Danish singeress Lis Srensen).Left Of The Middle could've been a quite OK album if the songs were polished a couple of times more, and if they had found a producer who was able to produce. And a singer who was able to sing this stuff in a catching way."
5,DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING.........,"This CD is AMAZING , from the words to the musics diversity, this CD is sure to win over many fans. Whatever you do, don't skip the best songs (IMHO), they are as follows (in order of favorite), 1.Smoke 2.Diving in the deep end 3. City (live version) & 4. Leave me alone. Go out and buy this great CD, you WONT be dissapointed."
4,"not as good as ""torn""",But I totally love it anyway! YAY Natalie - voice of a goddess in the making. I think there's more emotion coming accross on Torn but still there is SO MUCH amazing talent here. This dsic is a must have.
3,Tunes and Bunes,"This cd mixes pop with catchy lyrics. This is a great cd it just doesn't have some of the better songs in between the great songs. It's fillers aren't the greatest. The only reason i didn't like this cd is because it's more of a pop and not alternative cd. Not saying it's a bad cd it's just my opinion. It does have some great songs collected on her latest release ""Left of The Middle"". Performed with catchy tunes and great songwriting. A good Cd for all pop fans."
2,Coming to a Lilith Fair near you.,"Ms. Imbruglia is no Sarah McLaughlin, or Natlie Merchant, she's not even an Anggun. She does resemble a more talented Fiona Apple, or maybe a less irritating Alanis. The first track, ""Torn,"" got a fair amount of radio play, as well as ""Wishing I Was There."" If you liked Alanis Morisette's ""One Hand In My Pocket,"" you'll probably like this album. I found there to be nothing memorable on it except the first track."
5,Way Cool Cd!!,"This is a fun, cool and ultra - groovy Cd for anyone that likes addictive and very hip songs! A must for anyone who likes rock mixed with pop! Torn, Big Mistake and Wishing U Were There a really good!"
3,Don't kill her...,"Natalie Imbruglia is a fairly good artist. I think she sounds 2 much like the (*shiver*) Hansons in ""Wishing I Was There"". Unfortunately, I smell the rank stench of the illness many artists' songs Bcome infected w/ 'round ""Torn""... the overplayed-'til-no-1-can-stand-2-listen-2-it- anymore-so-people-start-despisin'-the-artist- instead-o'-the-V-/DJs-who-play-it illness. I'm glad, though, that people R startin' 2 give Australia credit now that INXS, Midnight Oil & Savage Garden Rn't some o' the only well-known Aussie artists out there, now, since I have background & family friends in the area. My fav song is ""Leave Me Alone""."
2,"pleasent listening, but crassly commercial","some producers in the nineties would eventually figure out how to tagret the ""modern-rock"" audience. Not oversickening and souless like the Spice Girls, but blatantly commercial"
2,one-hit wonder,"You can always judge an artist by how many used copies of their cd you find in record shops...these are people who bought the record then got sick of it and tossed it. There are no fewer than 7 copies of Left of the Middle at my local cd shop... She will have a hard time following up this cd, it is more ""middle of middle"" than anything else, and she does nothing to risk offending radio programers, who are about as middle of the road as they come. Enjoy the fame that came with this release, because your 15 minutes are about up."
1,I hate this!!!!,"sorry natile fans, but I think this is a really stupid cd - so don't waste your money!!! torn was okay, but all the others really s****d!!!!"
2,Well....,"I was listening this album before two years, so i don't remember too much, but i must say that it was nothing special. The best song is of course ""Torn"", ""wishing I was there"" and ""smoke"" are ok...but the rest of the songs I really don't remember too much. I just remember a lot of guitar scratching. Ok, she is good looking and she has good voice and I would like to go to bed with her but music isn't so great."
2,"Sadly disappointed......THE ALBUM IS ALL ""TORN"" UP","In early 1998, I enjoyed Natalie Imburglia and was a huge fan with her hit single ""Torn"". With ""Torn"" she had a unique style that rivaled Alanis, Sheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan (artists I like as well too).I bought the album but when the CD player moved past ""Torn"" I was definitely disappointed, the songs were so flat and common, it did not live up the uniqueness of ""Torn"". As much as I tried to play to get hooked to the album, the songs just failed to do so. Just as most of the reviews and critics said ""it was more middle of the middle"", the album was flat and boring.No wonder despite the huge success of ""Torn"", it being 2003 (5 years past and before Internet piracy) is still only 2X platinum.With the lack of success with her 2nd album ""White Lilles Island"", she will only been seen as a one-hit wonder and the girl next to Beyonce Knowles in those Loreal Feria Hair Care commericals."
2,"Trendy and hip in 1998, but hopelessly dated in 2005","1998 doesn't seem all that long ago to me, I was 13 when this was released, but it just seems so LLLOOOOOOOONNNGGG ago whenever I hear that song Torn. Just the way that song was produced just seems so tied to its era, and completely out of place any time after 1998. The melancholy, mopey tone in her voice, the production techniques...it seems like she was trying to sound ""alternative"" because that's what was hip at the time. Well guess what? Its 2005 now, and alternative rock is long dead. Anything with an alternative sound to it just sounds hopelessly dated and irrelivent. ""Left of the Middle"" is now collecting dust in the bargain bins, and Natalie is living proof that if you try to follow trends, you WILL be forgotten about almost overnight. Don't try to be cool, because cool doesn't last!"
3,Not so inspiring!,"Well, I love her song ""Smoke"" and some other songs but when she sings, it seems like she doesn't really put emotions along with the music. Therefore, it doesn't really touch your heart and is not inspiring. And she doesn't really have that incredible voice, you know. I'm sure she does have a passion towards her music, though."
2,"2 nice songs, that's all.","Since I bought this album a year ago or so I couldn't bare listening to the whole thing more than twice... I admit that I do like a lot the songs Smoke and Torn, and Natalie does have a very nice voice, but gee, all the other songs on this CD are simply too ANNOYING..."
5,A fresh and stimulating sound,Natalie Umbruglia sure got my attention when I listened to her work the first time. Her music grows on you. She is very talented and when you combine that with the creative energy coming through her music and words you have the result of music that can be heard over and over again. I look forward to her next CD.
2,Nice Try,"If anyone remembers who Natalie Imbruglia is in 5 years, I will be very suprised. This is just another classic example of the musical establishment stuffing a talentless pretty face down the throat of a lazy music buying public. There is an abundace of talented female musicians out there. Find them, and you too will see how insanly mediocre the music of Natalie Imbruglia sounds in comparison.One exception to my ""five year"" prediction. If she does an album with Glen Ballard she has a chance. Heck, he's turned others of equal abilities into superstars. Isn't it ironic?"
4,"Very good,fun music. Good to dance to.",Natalie Imbruglia hits us again with a show of her talents (previous actress on the Austalian soap oper Neighbours)! Wishing I Was There is a song good to play to an old boyfriend you never trusted. Torn is good to listen to in the middle of a hard decision. Natalie has huge blue eyes which help sell her album! Good job Natalie!
4,It gets better after Torn,"Despite what everyone else here is saying, I truly think that Torn is the weakest song on this CD. It is clearly there to suck in the masses (and it worked) but her integrity as an artist is found in tracks such as Smoke, One More Addiction and Pidgeons and Crumbs. So for those of you who find Torn kind of inane and way too mainstream, give this CD a go for the variety of arrangements, the constantly changing production styles and the interesting (OK, sometimes cliche-ish) lyrics. It's a pity she doesn't have the musical nouse to write her songs alone. From what I've heard she basically just does the lyrics and then mucks around with the melodies whilst her more accomplished colleagues work on the hard stuff. I think Natalie will find herself on the next album. She's come a long way from teenage Aussie soapie star!"
2,Most of the Album Does NOT LIve Up To The First Release,Very disappointed. Seems like all of the work and talent went into one or two songs. The rest are pretty awful.
4,bright new artist with interesting lyrics,"Natalie Imbruglia is similar to Alannis Morisette in style and word choice; however, Imbruglia's style is a softer version. Her songs are generally melancholy with a slightly bitter twist. Although ""Torn"" is the most well known of her songs currently, the other songs on the CD make it a worthwhile purchase for the contemporary music lover."
4,Lyrically and musically fresh,"Unforently, like most female singers, critics tend to compare them to one another. Natalie doesn't have the rage Alanis has but Alanis doesn't have the rage Hole has either. That's because people have different kind of rages. On LEFT OF THE MIDDLE, Natalie sparkles with her inner rage on starchy tunes that embody a since of fragileness--from her radio hit ""Torn"" to electronica on ""Impressed."" Overall the CD is fresh and beautifully done."
2,One-song CD,"I fell into the trap of buying this CD because I liked ""Torn."" Unfortunately, I should have saved some money and bought the single. The rest of the CD is mediocre at best."
4,All in all a decent CD,"this cd is very good, but many of the songs sound alike. If you like what is on the radio, you will like the whole thing!"
3,"ummm, is it over yet???","Okay, i have had this cd for a really long time. I listen to Torn a lot, it is a really, really good, good song. The others..... weird, to say the least. Good thing Torn is the first song on the cd. It makes the other eleven more bearable. To tell the truth though, i do find myself humming her other songs, better than her in some of her songs, i might add."
5,Go Natalie!,"A buetiful mix of the past and present showing a sight into the meaniful in the world of poetic sludge. Without the music I'd give it four stars for the poetry itself, but for the music and the stunning looks of Natalie mixes so well, she is charming and sweet, truly one of the best people in the world."
5,"A POP man, birth on the lates 70 but living on the early 60","Natalie Imbruglia, is a good talent woman in that appears at the lates '90 but it has the scence of the good POP Music, I like it, although my favourite band are the Beatles, Natalie is sweet to my ears, I like One more addiction more than a few of them that I heard."
4,Lovely,"After first hearing ""Torn"" on the radio, and then coming to Amazon to 'sample' the rest of the songs - I decided it was a CD to buy. I usually buy the whole CD - and to date have never downloaded a song.With many CD's I wish I had just downloaded a few songs - but not with this one. A high percentage of the songs are very good.Natalie has a good mix of rhythm and style. Her voice portrays emotion well, and I like how it sounds. No point arguing the case for any musician on how they rank against each other - everyone's taste varies.You can listen to it at low volume and enjoy it - or pump it up and feel her soul coming through.And when you listen to ""Torn"" - hold the cover in your hand and look at her eyes.Oh... and when you buy it - get ""White Lilies Island"" too. Well worth it. However - I wasn't impressed enough with ""Counting Down the Days"" to buy it yet. Need a chance to listen to it."
3,"""My mouth is dry, forgot how to cry...""","This was an album I had back in the day, Natalie Imbruglia's Left of the Middle had a lot of potential to be a great pop record but unfortantely many of the tracks fall flat. Songs I do appreciate are Torn, Big Mistake, Wishing I was There, Smoke, and Left of the Middle. The rest of the songs are aimless filler. Imbruglia does have a gorgeous voice but her inconsistent songwriting drags these songs down. This album is an oldie but not so goodie. Nice try Natalie!"
3,Left of the Middle,"The fun thing I've found about Amazon is that when I look up artists, they recommend similar artists and that is how I was introduced to this disc. I'd heard of the artist but really at the time of her debut, I was not watching MTV/VH1 so I never heard her ""hit"" single, 'Torn' till I got the disc.Overall, I rated it a 2.5 but she got the extra half star for co-writing a majority of the songs. After listening to it again for the first time in a while, my opinion is that this is a pretty good debut for a new artist - her voice is definitely pop oriented and because she was involved in the songwriting, she sings with passion & conviction because they are HER songs.The songs that I really enjoy listening to are: One More Addiction, Wishing I Was There, Smoke, Pigeons & Crumbs, Torn, Don't You Think & Left of the Middle.Based on how much I enjoyed this disc, I will give her 2nd cd a try just to see how she grew or IF she grew as an artist."
3,TORN IS THE BEST OF THE LOT! don't expect more,"Natalie Imbruglia is a fairly talented singer, but she should give up this song-writing junk! Her songs' (she wrote all but ""torn"") background sound like they were made in a car repair shop! There are drills and saws and welding noises, but at least it covers up the sappy, spice girl sounding lyrics. It is a great tragedy that a talented singer like her is forced to work with the drivel she gives herself. She should go into writing acceptance speeches for the oscars if she wants a job. Or maybe write some of those cruddy pieces of paper with printing on them that Jewel calls poems. The picture on the front looked like a ghoul with a raincoat who hasn't shaved around her mouth. But I loved the albums!"
5,"Torn is the expected joy, the rest of the album is the prize",This album is everything you expect it to be. Natalie doesn't rely only on one type of music. She is not just in one genre of music but in any she chooses to be. All the songs come off like she took great thought and work into creating them. She was helped and open minded while recording and it shows greatly that her work paid off.
5,"Yes, ""Torn"" is on the CD.....what's your friggin' point?","""Torn"" is overplayed drivel that I liked the first 1,000 times, and sorta still do, but the rest of this CD stands so far above it, it's not funny. Not one good hook among the songs? What are you guys ON? One More Addiction, Wishing I Was There, Don't You Think, Smoke -- MAN this is a good album! Not to mention that the original version of Torn, made by ""Ednaswap,"" is an annoying heavy metal piece of crud."
2,A boring album,"The only songs that really stick out on this album are ""Torn,"" a very-well crafted pop song with good lyrics about not knowing what to do in a relationship, and ""City,"" a non-generic rocker with an excellent hook. ""Leave Me Alone"" and ""Pigeons And Crumbs"" are pretty songs that are sung flatly. ""Impressed,"" with its pulsating beat, scores some points. On ""Smoke,"" Natalie's voice sounds downright annoying. ""One More Addiction"" copies Alanis too much (and not as well.) Ditto for ""A Big Mistake."" ""Wishing I Was There"" is an average song that's a little catchy. Natalie's bland voice and mostly non-special songs are not worth the money unless you really like the female angst singers with a passion."

2,weak,"The melodies fall flat and Imrgulia's voice is very, very weak. If she were on live, all the guitars and such in this album would drown out her voice. She should just stick to soap opera."
5,The best I have heard in a long time!!!,"Natalie Imruglia has a great talent of putting songs together of normal everyday problems, that not only teens, but everyone goes through. I would have to say that ""Leave Me Alone"" is my favorite song on there."
5,Great CD! ^_^,"You'll buy this CD for her hit, Torn, and listen to the rest of the tracks all the time! Great music, plus Imbruglia's great voice, make this a must-have"
4,Better than the press it gets...,"I grabbed Torn after Imbruglia's first two songs had been released, figuring that if nothing else it was something to listen to while my preferred artists were between releases. What I got turned out to be a far more interesting compilation of rather edgy pop tunes than I'd expected. I think Imbruglia's publicity wonks missed the mark a bit with their guidings...she's not the wounded yet sweet kiddo that her first song made her out to be. Imbruglia has a bit of a darker, more cynical side and shows it on several tunes. Musically, the CD does hop around somewhat in song styles, but overall delivers punchy, catchy, like-to-play-em-loud tunes that I can't help but enjoy. A particular favorite is Intuition, a Morrissette-esque guitar-and-bass driven upbeat tune that I have always thought would a great duet between Imbruglia and Morrissette. Certainly worth a look if you want a fun, engaging musical romp."
4,A real mix of styles,I got the CD mainly influenced by hearing 'torn' but there's something different to listen to on each song. Natalie's music is the better of Alanis and Sheryl Crow combined. Musically the album is extremely good and the song structures both simple to grow into after one or two sittings yet complex enough to be put into a class above the average pop/rock record available nowadays. Many of the songs stick in your head after the CD is over. It definitely would be on my 'Best of '98 ' list under more that one genre.
1,"""...I saw a man brought to life... "" until this cd","I had heard and seen the video for ""Torn"" get more than enough airplay. I loved the song. I decided to buy the album. Like the song says, ""Big Mistake."" It sure was. Then supposedly there was the sticker that said that there was 5 minutes of dead space before the last song. I am so glad that I returned it. Ms. Imbruglia is beautiful and can sing, but she is nothing more than a one-hit wonder. Granted the rest of the songs were co-written by her... I still was burned ('Smoke'd). ""Torn"" will be her significant song..."
5,My favorite CD,"This is one of the few pop albums I have bought that I can actually listen to straight through without skipping any songs. I will admit, however, that a few songs are kind of depressing. As one of my friends put it, ""Smoke"" is 'too songy,' but I still love the song. My favorite song on the CD is ""Impressed."" I love the lyrics - 'I don't like you but I'm impressed' - and the tune is very catchy."
5,COOL CD!!!,"I bought this CD a few months ago online, and I was amazed at how good it was! I absolutly love this CD, it's one of my favorites. It's the perfect CD for you if you like Jewel or Alanis Morrsette."
4,Very good.,"I particularly enjoy this cd mostly because of the point of most of the songs. My personal favorites are ""Intuition"", ""Pigeons and Crumbs"", and ""Left of the Middle"", maybe because the words are so perfect, maybe because the tune is complex, but obviously simple. I don't know why. I just really enjoy this cd and have gotten hours and hours worth of enjoyment listening to it."
5,NAtalie Imbruglia has outdone herself in this wonderful debu,"Natalie Imbruglia is one of the hottest singers out there, and her CD is just the same. Impressive songs like Smoke, Pigeons and Crumbs, Leave me Alone, and especially TOrn has made the CD one of its kind. With beautiful blends of soft music and rock music, this is a must get CD. The CD is wonderful and Natalie's voice is even better, but the CD has been overproduced and would be much better to hear natalie live. It just sounds better. Go get this album now=)"
4,Interesting new music from Natalie,"I am a huge fan of Natalie Imbruglia. Her music is very relaxing to listen to. Especially when you are tired or travelling. My favourite song of hers has to be her hit single, `Torn' closely followed by `Big Mistake' and `Wishing I was There' which are also very good songs because they both are slow, but with quite fast choruses. Her CD is great. There is a good mix of music ranging from slow to fast beats. Its a good change from any other albums I've listened to because most of the time you buy a CD, the songs are usually the same or have the same style or beats. Some great new music from Natalie."
4,This is very close to an all good cd!,"Natalie Imbruglia is my favorite singer! This is a really good cd, except for tracks 3,4,9, and 11. I think those songs are the most depressing! The rest of the cd is great! I love it!"
5,Very impressed,"This album is really good, and isn't another one of those 1-song albums. She puts so much emotion into her music and lyrics (esp. Smoke). Very good debut album in my opinion."
1,Just plain boring,"Sure, we all know how Torn was a big hit, (who could forget?) but after listening to the singles only, the rest is all downhill from there. This album is boring beyond belief. Not only is this lyrically and musically boring, but event the song titles are boring (""Pigeons and Crumbs"" ""One More Addiction"" ""Smoke"") and to top it off, she was a boring tv star, on a boring soap opera in a boring country. I could go on, but.. you get the picture."
4,This is a great and enjoyable album,"Natalie proves herself to be a hot new talented artist. This album takes you where no album has gone before, Left of the middle."
3,Only Torn stood out,"Although I do listen to and enjoy most of the songs on this cd, Only Torn really stands out in my mind as being anything other than just somthing to fill space on the cd."
4,One hour full of musical entertainment,"""Left of the Middle"" provides the perfect music for when you are cruising down the freeway with the stereo blasting. I can't tell you how many times I've listened to this CD and enjoyed it more each time. Each song provides a lot of clever lyrics that find there way into my personal philosophies; such as in ""Smoke"" where the words ""bleeding is breathing"" (which happens to be my favorite). I definatley reccomend this album. It's great listening."
3,"A very engineered pop album, but good.","The layered pop tracks are sometimes more interesting than her vocals. But, it is a pretty good album, worth a few listens. The lyrics a generally well written, but the delivery is, and I AM sorry, derivitive of that other angry female,(and the other one actually comes across as angry). However, I LOVE ""Smoke"",(her most impassioned and convincing delivery), as well as ""Pigeons and Crumbs"", and 'Left of the Middle"", and ""Leave Me Alone"" for it's catchy hook. But, even though she's patently weird, I think I like that other Natalie's ""Ophelia"" a little more, though Imbruglia is stunningly and classically attractive. Overall, a decent effort."
4,"Imbruglia's First Album ""Left"" an Impression","It's been mentioned before that Natalie was a soap star before launching a succesful music career. In addition to this Natalie is completely beautiful and because of this many people disregard her and her music. Unlike the Britney's and Cristina's of the world, Natalie's pop music is deep and filled with human emotion. The girl is clearly not interested in just cashing a check.The first single off the album, Torn, was and continues to be one of my favorite songs of all time. It has a great and catchy guitar sound that definitely makes the listener want to rock out. I would give this song alone 5 stars but since this is a collective review I am giving it 4 stars. Not because I didn't like it but because I felt it was missing a little something.In the end this is certainly a cd that should be picked up by anyone who enjoys talented singers and songwriters."
3,Buy the single!,"Torn is by far the best song on the CD. I'd give Torn a 10 and the rest of the songs a 1 or 2. Ironically, Natalie was involved in writing all the songs, except Torn. I suggest buying the single if it's cheaper"
4,Interesting melange of styles,"At first I was surprised to hear that most songs on the CD differ somewhat from ""Torn"". After the 3rd time I played it completely though I was convinced that this girl from downunder is on a level of music that Kylie Minogue would have liked to have reached but never did (not even close)Top songs: Torn, Smoke and City (not necessarily in that order)"
5,Natalie Imbruglia rocks!,"I've had this cd for a while and normally I get tired of cds very quickly, but I haven't gotten tired of this one. ALL the songs are really good. So you should buy it!"
4,Every cathecism class needs this book!,"I'm an adult convert to the Lutheran church and I wish we had had this book to study going through New Members class. Now, I'm playing catch up with this book and finally understanding so much of what is done in the liturgy. I gave the book only four stars as it's a bit short on detail on some things. For example, the sanctuary candle gets about two lines none of which explain that this tradition goes all the way back to the synagogues of the Jews, and is a sign of the abiding presence of God. Great book though for those new to the Lutheran faith."
5,Lovely movie,"My daughter and I love this movie, it's well made, it is fun, inspiring and teaches a great lesson, besides, shows part of the American History in a kids way. I'll recommend it to everyone who likes American Girl series."
5,Great,"The product or the dvd is what the seller described. It is great, there were no problems in the dvd. I am a glad customer."
3,NOT Widescreen,"Please be warned: this is NOT Widescreen as listed here on Amazon. Although the movie is great, if you are like me and want widescreen movies, this is NOT it. I hope Amazon will change this to reflect the correct version."
3,.:.:.:.:.:.:.:.:,"i decided to watch this with my sister because nothing else was on TV. also i used to read American Girl books when i was younger so i wanted to see if the characters in the movie would resemble the ones in the series. to make this short, the acting was terrible. Mia Farrow is a horrible actress and the girls who played Samantha and Nellie were so fake. we made fun of the movie the whole time and actually had a good time. in general tho this movie wasn't too bad (despite the acting). little kids would definitely like it."
5,Samantha DVD,My daughter was 10 when I gave her this DVD - glad to say we have watched this time and time again - this is wonderful story for a young and old audience - with so many questionable movies today - were are glad to have a movie that is 100% clean!
2,I found it a little boring,"I bought this for my 7 year old for her to watch for a holiday movie. Well she stayed for a max of 30 mins, and I stayed for 45, I just found it very boring and I love american girls."
4,Good Movie for young girls.,I thought this movie was a very good for my young girls. It shows what life was like in 1904 America and awareness for helping others.
5,GREAT family movie!,"My wife and our 11 year old daughter watched this and all loved it. It's so refreshing to have a wholesome movie. Now...there were the usual Disney-esque heart string tugging tricks of parents dying and that type of thing, but overall, a wonderful movie."
2,So-so,"I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name. They were not what I was expecting when they arrived. They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be. They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent. The silver is also okay, but could be better. I would not recommend."
2,There have to be better books on miscarriage...,"I was lent this book by a friend, so at least I didn't waste my money on it. My two main complaints are (1) I have a very hard time trusting an author who admits that she tricked her husband into pregnancy, and (2) the text is very repetetive, saying the same things, over and over and over, leaving me to wonder whether this was necessary to make a book out of what amounts to little substance."
5,Very helpful - highly recommend.,I really got a lot of this book after my missed miscarriage at two months pregnant. It helped me emotionally to hear her story and the stories of other women. It also provided me with all the medical information I needed and helped me to get a list of questions for my doctor. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has lost a pregnancy.
5,This is a book of healing!!,I purchased Motherhood... 2 weeks after my miscarriage and I wished I had gotten it sooner. I needed every word of the book so badly because I was seeking answers and solutions and no one could really help me. This book has aided me in healing. I had one successful pregnancy and never imagined in a million years that I would have a miscarriage during my 2nd pregnancy. Thanks to Ms. Diamond ( a true diamond indeed) for the gift of knowledge she has given to all women!!
3,Not for everyone,"At first, I really liked this book. I liked the way it began and could relate to what other women had experienced. Having gone through a ""missed miscarriage"" myself, I sought an explanation for what had happened but I also was looking for some motivational support in preparing to try again. In my opinion, the book became very scientific and confusing and I slowly became uninterested and started to bounce around to different chapters. Even though the author suggests that all women should keep trying, though some won't, I didn't feel the author provided much emotional or motivational support that I was looking for and walked away feeling concerned, doubtful, sad, worried, anxious and confused. I've decided that this book was not for me and have put it away with all my other books and doubt I will ever go back to it. I don't think this book is for everyone, but it might be worth giving it a try."
4,What does it mean when someone plays with lizards?,"Don't judge a movie by its cover. This film is nothing like its title or the pictures on the box. All Revved Up seems to describe the emotions of the main character as he finds a woman who still intrigues him once she likes him back. If you're a fan of movies like ""Trees Lounge"" or ""Kicked in the Head""- a kind of quiet study of desperate, strange people -- you'll prob. enjoy it. Worth it for me because of Taylor, Turturro and Patton."
2,No Over-Drive...,"The title ""All Revved Up"" and the cover with erotic sports cars and 155 mph is nothing more than a movie with no ""Over-Drive."" The offbeat friends were quirky...really they were quite strange. They became vigilates during the last 15 minutes of the movie...to collect the money paid for car repairs which none were made...the big scam. The biggest scam is to viewer that are expecting high octane and some early action."
5,best,"There are some books that are simply the best. This is one of them. Modern herbalists owe a great debt to Dr. C, for putting up with a lot of harassment, disbelief, and just ridicule. This book is just the best there is, in its subject matter.There Are No Incurable Diseases: Dr. Schulze's 30-Day Cleansing & Detoxification Programwas written by one of Dr C's students, and is a simplified form of Dr C's ideas."
5,Every herbalist should have this book on their bookshelves!!,"All of my teachers and mentors, from Rosemary Gladstar to Michael Tierra have all touted Dr. Christopher and this book! We even have it at the natural products cooperative where I work in our library. It really brings home herbal medicine and formulation. If you have ever used the Dr. John R. Christopher formulas that are available in health food stores, you know how good they are. All of the formulas are contained within this book and many more that are certain to find use in every home interested in empowering themselves through herbal healing."
5,School of Natural Healing,"Most complete natural medicine book by one of the most exceptional homeopathic doctors who ever lived shares his mass knowledge on how to make salves, tinctures, anything for natural healing and gives exact measurements of herbs to be used. Excellent! Thanks Amazon."
1,worthless company,"Well I strongly discourage anyone from buying this or any other product from "" THE SPORTSMAN'S GUIDE"". I just receivied my fly poll and reel and it showed up with part of the poll sticking out of the mangled box and broken! When I called customer service and spoke with supervisor by the name of ""PAIGE""they said ""OH SORRY BUT I GUESS WE JUST WRECKED YOUR CHRISTMAS"" horrible service and if I could give them a negative ""star"" I certainly would! Again I'd like to thank ""paige"" for her sarcasm, that really helped the situation!"
3,Not a bad Rod,"For the previous reviewer, a fishing pole is spelled pole, not poll. A poll is something we do during election time. And I bet the company sent you a new pole."
4,Udderly smooth,This is a pretty good product. Seems to work as advertised. It does take a little getting used to as the texture is much thinner than typical products like Lubriderm.
4,An older guide,"I was in search of some resources to guide a brand new coach who isn't all that familiar with the technical details of the game. This book contains lengthy descriptions of the rules and explanations of the different roles each player has on the court. I found all of this helpful. My only complaint is since this is an older book it does not mention rally scoring which is predominatly in use today. The book centers on describing the old 15 point system, and the rules associated with that. I'm glad that it took the time to explain what each job on the court is and so I am happy with my purchase as a whole."
3,great!,"This book was very useful.. I consulted it as my Bible for my first season coaching volleyball. Includes many drills, graphics and more."
5,Great British TV show!,"I really love this British TV show about Spooks (that is what they call spy's over there). There's only 10 episodes to this season, but it is still awesome show. I love the story lines and the acting. It's just a wonderful and different style of TV programming. I can't wait to see the next season."
4,Season 2 Review of Mi5,"Compared to season 1, season 2 is way more intense. Season1 wasn't bad but was a bit of a drag. Season 2 is a bit more edgy imho."
5,Much Better Than Season 1,"I had only marginally good things to say about MI-5, Series/Season 1. Willing to give the series a fair shot, I watched Series/Season 2. And I'm glad I did. Much better than the first go-around, Series/Season 2 ends with a bang with quite a bit of meat enroute to the series conclusion. Two episodes - the Emergency Reaction Exercise and President's Visit episodes - were outstanding. There are two new series - I can't wait until we get them on DVD."
3,"MI-5, Vol 2","I bought the first three DVD's in the series for just one person: Matthew MacFadyen. Ever since I saw him in Pride and Prejudice, I've been enamored with him.I think that the episodes are too short to tell the stories well. They are good to watch when there is nothing else on."
3,$60 or more for 10(!) episodes? seriously?,"I've not actually seen Volume 2. I bought and have watched the first DVD set (for a much more reasonable price), and enjoyed it. This is a good series, and I'm sure the next 10 episodes are well done (typical anti-Bush BBC bias aside), but c'mon, 60 dollars or more?Consequently, I'm reviewing the *cost*. When I can get a 22 episode season of, say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer (or any number of great TV shows) for maybe $40, I'd say that getting about 1/2 the episodes (allowing for them being a *full* hour) for 50% higher cost is not a good bang for the buck."
1,AGENDA DRIVEN,"Watched the first few minutes of this show, seemed driven by an anti-Israel agenda.Two thumbs DOWN."
1,Loctite 4011,Package arrived on time. Contents were packaged for safe travel. They even sent me two for the price of one. The main problem is the product was out of date by two months when it arrived. This would be O.K. except this is Medical Glue not glue for every day use. Guess it will be good to help fill up the trash can.
3,Colorless Rothko,"This book is a reprint of the catalogue for the memorable 1978 exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in NYC, which was the first large-scale Rothko retrospective to be mounted after the artist's death. As such, the text, written by an authority on post-war American art (Diane Waldman)has become a classic and the short contribution by writer Bernard Malamud recalling his friendship with the artist is a moving piece of literature.Unfortunately, out of 275 illustrations, only about a third are in color (practically all of the early works are reproduced in black and white), which is rather frustrating to a Rothko lover. Therefore, only three stars to this book..."
2,Not a clear seal,"I ordered this product to seal a small tear in back plastics of convertible top.The add said ultra CLEAR or super clear or some garbage about it being SUPER CLEAR.I guess it's your own definition of what clear is.It is not my ideal of clear. It did seal the 1/2"" tear. Now I have a 1/2"" wide X 1"" long Mark looks like clear door seal you would use on your house. Light shines thru kinda, but you can't see thru it. Just a spot now instead of tear.Not Happy with the word of CLEAR!Service and shipping as unseal was Great. It the product not the service."
4,"simple & good, good & simple","having compared, or contrasted, the readings from a wireless weather station & this easy, all-in-1 green'cheen, one can practice 'interpolating' fairly accurate readings. the thermometer is small & difficult to see or read, cuz the unit must be placed high enough to work effeciently. the one this new one replaced lasted 5 yrs. slj"
3,Weather Station,This product is not very substantial. It is rather small and the plastic windvane is quite flimsy.
2,mastercaster,Very cheaply made. Not very durable. Need a magnifying glass to read the numbers. The rain guage only records 4 inches of rain at a time. Many times I get more rain than this. Not enough product for what it cost.
5,Found Again!,My husband had a Deer Weather Station and a few years ago the glass vial broke. So happy to have found one again!!
2,I was excited....,"I was excited when I heard this was going to be released. I hurried to the store on the Tuesday it was released to buy, and even more excited when I found out it was a 2 CD set! I took the CD home and listened to it and when it was done with disc one I thought, ""is this all there is to it""? A bit disappointed, I was. The second disc is basically throwaway stuff to snag consumers like me. Other reviewers have mentioned the Rooftop Sessions. Inclusion of those sessions would have made this collection GOLD. Unfortunately with the #1s CD being so successful, the decision makers are probably saving Rooftop for another completely different disc. How much money does Paul McCartney need? Overall, ""Naked"" is for completes only."
3,Only a few differences,"Most of the LET IT BE album was not butchered by Phil Spector. Only ""Let It Be,"" ""Across the Universe,"" ""I Me Mine"" and ""The Long and Winding Road"" had his overdubbed choir. The rest of the songs on LET IT BE...NAKED sound pretty much identical to the original CD release. But the idea for the second disc, FLY ON THE WALL is clever. The entire CD has only one track, which is twenty-two minutes long. It is an interesting look at the way The Beatles interacted together in the studio and has snippets of songs.All in all, it isn't an essential purchase like 1 or the ANTHOLOGY albums, but it's still a worthy effort."
3,Aren't We Lucky This Wasn't Originally Released Like This,"Although Let It Be was a good album after being spectorized, we're lucky that this wasn't released in its original form. No wonder it cost Capital records money. This sounds like they really didn't care anymore and the tracks were poorly done. However, The Long And Winding Road is still a beautiful song no matter what form it is in. The 2nd CD is just a recording of the Beatles at work in the studio which is better listening than the album itself. They sound like they're having fun with what they're doing. They're laughing, joking and singing. Unfortunately this does not come out in the Let It Be recording. If you're a true Beatles fan like I am, then I'd say get it just to add to the collection. If not, don't waste your money. Thank God I got it on sale."
4,first time hearing it period,"I am listening to The Beatles LetIt Be... Naked as i speak on the vh1classic listening party. I never heard the original album so I'm reviewing this from a different perspective than other reviewers. Ofcourse I've heard the hit songs before(title track, Get Back, The Long and Winding Road, Across the Universe). I'd heard the song Two of Us once when my local classic rock station used to have a program called the album side at 7. I'm giving this album 4 stars because I love the Beatles, but to tell the truth this album is pretty dull compared to others. When you think about it these songs were just leftovers."
3,send Phil Spector to the chair,"This is not and never was a collection of the Beatles' best tunes, but even what they tossed off was better than most. Changing the order of the songs was a good idea; they actually seem to flow, both musically and thematically. The last 3 tunes here illustrate their individual philosophies - George's selflessness, John's existentialism, Paul's stoicism. Nearly every song benefits from removal of the Spectorization. The Long and Winding Road, though sparse and still lyrically sappy, now has a nice piano figure in place of the emetic string-syrup. The naked version of Across the Universe is beautiful.Disc 2 is something you might play once or twice - mostly snippets of studio conversation that sound like a marriage ending...Paul talks about planning a future direction for the band, while the others all seem to know it's over.Of their original studio releases, Let It Be was the only one I hadn't purchased on CD. Glad I waited; this is a bit better."
3,7 kinds of ambiguity,"Yes, I bought it, enjoyed it, and recognize that I've been suckered. But unlike a good many of my fellow Amazon customers, I find it hard to get too hot and bothered about this latest bit of stealth merchandising by Macca. The tres moderne digital sound is a plus when it comes to ""Two of Us,"" ""For You Blue,"" and several other cuts. As for ""The Long and Winding Road""--c'mon, folks, it's a piece of schmaltz to begin with, and so is ""Let It Be"" (with an extra dose of Mariolatry). It's top-quality schmaltz, I should say, written by a real pro. But when you lean too hard on stuff like this--which is what Phil Spector did when he added the choirs and strings--it turns into something worse: kitsch. So I prefer the stripped-down versions. A pox, however, on the crappy second disk, and on inserting an inferior version of ""Don't Let Me Down,"" and on the general miserliness of the whole package, which should have included a second disk of outtakes and discards."
2,Don't expect much,"I'm not sure if this is the director's cut, or a rough draft. However, it seems to supplement rather than supplant the original album. In fact, this album is about 89% of what you heard on the 1970 original--there are no radical or breathtaking changes with this album.The main redactions are with ""The Long and Winding Road,"" and ""Across the Universe,"" plus a different take of ""Get Back"" (minus the hilarious audition comment). ""Let it be"" and ""Long and Winding Road"" sound almost like the singles available on the ""Blue Album.""Therefore, everything else sounds more or less the same. An incidental Beatles fan should stick with the original.Actually, I am fan of the film rather than the album, so I enjoyed the ""Fly on the Wall"" bonus CD. It serves as an hors-d'oeuvre until they get the film out on DVD. Paul! Ringo! Mush! Don't Get Back--Just Get Cracking!"
2,Let It Be - 2003,"I recently listened to the original Let It Be (1970) on vinyl, and this version (2003) on CD, back-to-back. To me there is just no comparison. The original is easily more satisfying. I think it's even better than Abbey Road."
1,They Should Have Let It Be,Imagine that the bottom end of your stereo dropped out while you were playing the real Let It Be. What a waste.
2,Let It Be - 2003,"Comparison of the key tracks:Get Back - new version is cut off at the end. Oh, and it's not yet ""pure"". If we're going to remove everything except the four Beatles, then take out Preston's piano and see how good that sounds. Original is better.Long & Winding Road - new version has some lightweight solo in the middle. Spector's backing orchestra added a lot. Original is better.Let It Be - new version removes a great distorted guitar solo and replaces it with a much poorer substitute. Original is better.Across the Universe - new version removes orchestra and highlights John's nasally voice. Orginal is better.I think Spector knew what he was doing. 2-stars."
2,Good songs-Bad Performance,"My title speaks for itself. This CD sounds pretty crappy. Great songs to be redone by basement bands of today, which was my purpose in buying it. But it's obvious the Fabs were on the way out. It really blows if you're looking for great listening of the band."
1,Exposes the weaknesses,"Many fans are very disappointed with this album. This is an example of the emporer without his clothes. Without the dressing the beatles really are naked. They composed some nice tunes, but the singing here is terrible."
2,Let It Be,This is the best Beatles release since they ceased to exist. The original album was a soundtrack to a film. This is an album.Do yourself a favor...
1,The Beatles answer to grunge... Fifteen years too late.,"First thing I noticed; Same cover design as Nirvana's ""Bleach"". I suppose the Beatles decided to get into the whole ""strip the production down"" mentality that all grunge bands lived by... fifteen years ago. The Beatles had obviously missed the bus on the whole grunge movement, and they're trying to compensate way too late by putting out an underproduced version of something they'd already done. Compare ""Bleach"" and ""Naked"" covers; each have inversed photographs in the same exact area of the cover (in huge strip going across the center), and they both have the text in the same exact places."
1,I thought all these guys were dead?,"The Beatles are really getting old and boring. They are a good band, but come on, how many times can you hear the same songs, over and over and over again. Its time to move on people."
3,Noodled,"would have been a better title. What mastermind thought this one up? Why was ""Dig It"" removed? I longed to have the full version on CD of this creative burst of energy, not its absence. Actually, if the ""corporation"" or whatever put this thing out wanted to put out something different, the George Martin proposed 1968 album of these sessions has always been my preferred choice, if not the Beatles (let's face it, though, they couldn't agree on anything at the time, anyway). True, this version lacked ""Across the Universe"" and ""I Me Mine""--instead consisting of ""Don't Let Me Down,"" ""Teddy Boy (a better version than on Paul's first) and a 5 min. take of ""Dig It""--these missing elements could've always been included as bonus tracks or inserted somewhere. Attention please corporate owners of music: don't rewrite history. Why not try again ""letting it be"" one more time by ""getting back"" to the way it was, but, next time, add more to it (e.g., music). Thanks for the crisp mixes, though."
4,Passing the audition in theEmporers new clothes,"After almost 35 years since it was recorded,the Beatles Get Back session spawns another album in Let It Be...Naked.The difference between it's sister album 1970's Let It Be is the reshuffling of certain tracks,the adding(Don't Let Me Down) and omission of others (Dig It,Maggie Mae),the lack of studio chatter and most importantly,the remixing and total wipe of Phil Spector's overdubbed of the first LIB album.At 35 minutes,Other songs and covers from the session could've been included.But the intention is to redo Let It Be as an album that the surviving Beatles have final say on.It may only be for the hardcore fans,but it shows they have passed the audition."
2,"Great sound, but...","Now I can see why they brought in Phil Spector to re-produce the original album back in the 60s. On ""The Long and Winding Road"" especially, the lack of strings in this version makes the song really fall short. ""I Me Mine"" is more of a curiousity--not losing too much in the transition to only acoustic, but not gaining much either. ""Across the Universe"" holds up better, probably due to the string-like sitar effects in the backround. If you already own the original, don't waste your money."
4,The Beatles as Nature intended,"The originalLet It Bealbum featured overdubs added by Phil Spector. This album features most of the same songs without overdubs. Which album is better? I would have to give the nod to the original, but this album is an interesting variation. Actually, some of the songs aren't too different at all, as some of them had no overdubs in the first place. But the songs here have been given a superior mixing, thanks to modern technology. Beatles fans will want to pick up this CD, just don't expect any great revelations here. Oh, I suppose I should say a few words about the ""Fly on the Wall"" bonus disk. It features 22 minutes of conversations among the Beatles and very brief snippets of songs. It is slightly interesting, but it's not something most people would want to listen to more than once."
2,Let It Be-Naked A big let down,"I was very disapointed with this release because it really contains nothing new consitering there is about 300 hours of tape to these sessions.The album is only 34 minutes long and all the talking has been takin off so it doesn,t seem like a live in studio recording I perfer the Spectorized album better. The 2nd disc is utterly worthless its just some talking and short rehersal songs.They had a chance to make this a great package full of extras but they blew it. Please do not buy this product itis a waste of money. Also I see why it was only $11.00"
3,I guess we can have it both ways...,"I can appreciate Paul McCartney's wanting to get this project right as it was bugging him for 30 plus years. And Paul was the main contributer to the ""Let it Be' project because Lennon was strung out on heroin and Yoko and George was apathetic. The inclusion of ""Don't Let Me Down"" is a very good addition. This version of ""Across the Universe"" is better. And the deletion of some nonsense material is also a good move. However, the ""Long and Winding Road"" sounds better on the original recording and the ""Let It Be"" guitar solo and riffs by Harrison sound much crisper and heavier on the original. This version (which was actually recorded earlier) has a rather weak sounding guitar sound that detracts mightily from this otherwise excellent rock song. No wonder Lennon made fun of this soft version of the song ""Let It Be"". If the best song on the album was made worse than this project cannot really be called an improvement."
3,Let Let It Be Be,"One of the things I liked best about the song ""Let it be"" on the original album was the driving guitar solo that made it much more powerful than the 45rpm single. The version included on LIBN sounds more like the single -- sweet, hymnlike, lots of organ. The version on the original Let It Be album, I suspect, was one John Lennon would have preferred -- sounds more like a rock band."
5,BEATLES,"[...]Let it be Naked , from my point of view, is more an album that Let it be the soundtrack. My preference deeping in songs would depend in each song. Is complementary anyhow. And Let it be (both versions) as an album is very strong, I don't know why some consider it a weak album. It contains Get Back, Let it be, Across the Universe, The Long ans winding Road, I've got a feeling and now, Don't let me down. This are very strong songs.This era of the Beatles, beside that was not the best in spirit, musically is absolutetely great (including first solo efforts )."
5,Why couldn't Phil Spector just Let it be?,Let it be the way It was always meant to bless my ears! :) 5 starts
4,"Raw, gritty, unpolished -- just what the Beatles envisioned","Let it Be...Naked is the fulfillment of a vision 30-plus years overdue. The Beatles wanted this album to be raw--no overdubs, no studio tricks, and for goodness sake, no strings or horns. The Let it Be that we've all come to know (and, let's face it, love) is an entertaining album despite Phil Spector's intrusion; it's just not the album the Beatles conceptualized. THIS is that album. Yes: it is less polished in spots than the original Let it Be. But that's the beauty of it. We finally get to hear them play, warts and all, without a sea of sappy strings in the way, sweetening up what was intended to be sugar-free. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I liked the inclusion of Dig It and Maggie May (the latter especially) and find myself missing them on the new disc. Well done to Sir Paul and the rest."
5,"has a real ""you are there"" quality","What they've done to this album goes beyond the removal of the controversal Phil Spector additions and manipulations that were on the original release. Playing the CD on my stereo, it felt almost as if the Beatles were actually performing in my living room. Compared to the original, the vocals in particular are much more distinctive and alive in this new version. These are definitely not the cuts heard previously on the Anthology release."
2,Thanks Phil,"This release is evidence that Phil Spector added a nice dimension to songs like ""The Long and Winding Road"". As time passes, the orchestral Phil Spector produced version will be the one that stands as the hit."
2,McCartney Revisionism,"It's interesting that Paul McCartney waited for George Harrison to pass away before ""setting the record straight"" on the infamous ""Let It Be"" album. Of course, Ringo Starr praised Paul's efforts and called the new version ""bloody marvelous."" However, I expected -- and deserved -- more. Where is the original, unedited ""Get Back"" album? Where is the rooftop gig? Where are the rough edges? Avoid ""Let It Be . . . Naked"" and track down the superior ""Get Back"" bootlegs that continue to flood the market. Regardless of what Paul believes, he hasn't put the ""Let It Be"" issue to rest. In fact, he has a lot to answer for -- and I'm surprised he didn't reverse the Lennon-McCartney credits like he did on ""Wings Over America."" What a petty individual."
2,why bother?,"The original version as compiled, edited, salvaged and produced by Phil Spector, with taste and majesty, is light years beyond this feeble offering. As a die hard Beatle fan, I don't say this lightly."
4,Musical Experiment or Apple Rip Off?,"I just gave it my first listen. It's an interesting fan-fiction CD, sort of like the Yellow Submarine Songtrack (both have stellar sound), but I could have pieced this together from the original album and the raw tracks on Anthology 3. ""I Me Mine"" is still the spector edit. Only 11 tracks?? There are tons of unreleased Get Back session songs. ONE would have been nice. I feel like I've been ripped off a bit. I only give you my money.But it's a wonderful package and the ""Fly on the Wall"" disc makes it worth the price. I think the Glyn Johns version would have more interesting. But maybe now Paul can get over it.[...]"
2,Let it be (naked),I bought this album when it came out and I loved it as a kid. But even then I thought Long and Winding Road was kind of pompous and a little muddy with regard to the sound. These are terrific versions of these songs. Much better than the original mix.
4,A great final album from a great band,"I wish every Beatles album received the treatment of being remastered to 24-bit quality. The result is crystal clear sound and a whole new listening experience.Let It Be has always been my second favorite Beatles album (the first being Revolver, if you care). I was excited to find it remastered. Like I said before, the result is a whole new listening experience.The sound is clear, and some songs sound different because of the clearer, superior sound. The ""Let It Be"" solos are better, different tones can be heard from the guitars.""Fly on the Wall,"" the second disk included in this package, is a ""unique insight"" into the making of Let It Be. Containing snippets of different songs and interviews, it reveal different sides to the members of the band.Let It Be . . . Naked is definately what I would want from Apple (I don't know what other people are talking about), and I hope that all Beatles albums receive this treatment."
3,"Naked, better suited to Anthology","The original recording produced by Phil Spector is a classic.Although I enjoyed listening to the stripped down versions of""The Long And Winding Road"" ""Across The Universe"" and""Let It Be"" most of Naked seems rather lifeless. I think thesesongs stripped to their original tracks should have been a project included in The Beatles Anthology.Spector's ""Let It Be"" is a powerful musical statement.Let it Be"
1,Buy the real,"""Let It Be... Naked"" is so offensive it both concept and content, that it's hardly possible to believe that this release actually happened. What the ""fans"" of this version must realize is that THIS VERSION IS NOT THE VERSION THAT THE BEATLES INTENDED TO RELEASE OR ENDORSED. This irrelevant release is Paul McCartney's vision of what he NOW wants ""Let It Be"" to be. [...] To sum it all up: Buy the real 1970 version, buy it quick, before Sir Paul decides to have it deleted form the catalog and enjoy that album for what it is, Beatles outtakes and live tracks rescued by Phil Spector and cobbled into a fairly satisfying album."
3,Still their worst album,"Even in this stripped-down, cut-and-paste version, this is still the worst Beatles album of them all. Mediocre songs abound (""One after 909"" and ""Don't Let Me Down"" in particular), and the few decent songs are basically a drag. (""Let It Be"" was covered live by The Hollies in 1970, and their version is better). I'd much rather listen to them from their early years, when they had inspiration and vitality. This is the sound of a band falling apart, and it ain't pretty."
3,"Paul's Vehicle, not The Beatles!","The Beatles argued about this album in the beginning now Paul's got two of them out of the way, he can release HIS Let It Be. It's only OK! I wonder what John and George would say about this release?"
2,Let it be,"Why is this so bad. I just get tired. My girlfriend got this and I feel the other one is better. Much more so. Is it just a way to make more money? I feel like we thought we were getting new songs but all they did was take the old songs and leave off the embellishments. ""The long and winding road"" use to sound like a lullabye now it sounds like its unfinished. But my girlfriend had me laauhging today with one by the Rolling Stones called ""let it bleed""! I think the Rolling Stones were prolly ripping off the Beatles in a real obvious way!!!Matthew Poturich"
2,The Beatles only weak album???,"Please. I think maybe only ""Revolver"" has no weak tracks. I love the Beatles as much as the next guy, but am at least honest enough to admit that AT LEAST 1/4 of their catalog was [junk].Just because Rolling Stone named ""Sgt. Pepper"" as the best album of all time doesn't mean it is (now THERE'S a weak album...ugghh)AND I'm a Paul fan!"
2,Validates Phil Spector's Contribution,"This release just validates the fact that Phil Spector added a lot to the original version. ""Long and Winding Road"", ""Let It Be"", ""Get Back"" and ""Across the Universe"" are all better on the 1970 release. It also validates to me who was the primary ego that broke up the group. This is embarrassing.Maybe one day Ringo will have the opportunity behind Paul's back to re-do lightweight songs like ""Yesterday"" and ""Here There and Everywhere"" and add drum tracks to them."
3,Isn't Something Missing??,I don't think Let It Be ... Naked is much better than the original Let It Be. The thing that struck me funny was the omission of the song Maggie Mae on Let It Be ... Naked. I enjoyed that song on Let It Be and was dissapointed to find that it was not on Let it Be ... Naked. Overall an OK album.
2,Let It Be,"Far from the best album of 2003!The original was just barely keeping up with the times when it was released in 1970, as Led Zep and Pink Floyd had passed them by. There was no need to reproduce this 30 years later. Oh, other than money and ego, of course."
2,Nooooo...,"Like any good Beatles fan, I used to grouse about how Phil Spector puked all over ""Let it Be"" when it was supposed to be a return to the roots, blah blah blah. And then I heard ""Let it Be... Naked."" Ugh. ""Let it Be"" is the worst of the Beatles' albums anyway (though still better than 95% of the garbage out there), and stripping it down makes it that much worse. I realize now that the cheesy orchestral bits actually helped. ""Don't Let Me Down"" is an atrocity. So is ""Get Back."" The Beatle chatter CD is too short and random and could have been so much better. Also, I really haven't been too impressed with the way Macca is trying to ""fix"" things-- including changing ""Lennon/ McCartney"" to ""McCartney/ Lennon."" Paul wouldn't have dared try any of this if John were still alive. I wish he'd left this alone. Or relegated it to the Anthology."
1,Boring! I prefer it dressed,"Don't buy it. It's 2 CDs, one of 35 minutes, the other of 21. So you'll pay double for 56 minutes of the worst music in the Beatles' career, with dire, dull, boring performances. Only two exceptions: the crisper ""For You Blue"" and the better ""The Long and Winding Road"". Excepting these two cases, Spector's album is light years better than this stuff.With zillions of hours of rehearsals and outtakes, was this the best they could do with disc 2? I'm really angry at this ripoff."
5,This Much Better than The Subsequent Version!,"NAKED is definitely a much better version of the ""LET IT BE"" (Lp/Cd) than the previously issued commercial & second version of the album. Though ""The Long And Winding Road"" has always held a very heartfelt soft spot in my heart and soul, and I do miss the orchestral strings, this original version kicks ass! My question, after all has been said and done so many years after and reputation/history of the album withstanding, HOW MUCH $$$ DID PHIL SPECTOR GET PAID $$$ to add strings and lengthen most of these tracks? I NEVER understood what was so ""monumental"" about Spector producing the Beatles...in fact, there were tons of landmark recordings being produced simultaneously outside his famed ""Wall Of Sound"" productions of the early Sixties that never recieved the hype his did. His productions are ""another dimension"" of the recorded music spectrum. LET IT BE - Naked would've been a huge hit as it is here and now, as it was before!"
4,"Same, but a little newer","I have to admit, Let It Be was never my favorite Beatles album, mostly because I didn't like all of the orchestration on the album, it didn't seem to fit with the songs lacking orchestation. 'Across the Universe' sounds much better without the female voices, and although it was available without them on the charity recording, this version is a bit slower and a little more passionate. All in all, I don't think that this album was completely necessary, but let's be honest, neither was the original album. However I must say that this is a marked improvement over the 1970 version. My only problems with it are the fact that two songs were cut from the recording, and the original banter in between songs is now gone."
3,A little disappointing,"I miss the dialogue, and I don't like the new sequencing (I program my cd player to the original sequence). I would have preferred the de-Spectorized ""Long and Winding Road"" that was on Anthology 3, as the instrumental break in this one seems really cheesy (same with that of Let it Be). ""Don't Let Me Down"" is a great replacement for ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae"". I like most of the songs in their raw form, so this is a vital document...however, it's not as charming as the original."
4,Some apparent duplication....,"...if you have the ""Anthology 3"" collection, be aware that you already have many of the alternate ""takes"" on this CD (albeit mixed slightly differently)."
2,"The music is good, but...","the title is horrible, the cover is ugly, the booklet is boring (save for the essay), and the 2nd disc is a complete joke considering the wealth of material that exists (10 second song clips- how generous.) I suppose ""true"" Beatles fans would disagree, but then, to them, a bonus of 20 minutes of the Beatles farting would have sufficed. What a rip-off. No wonder people file-share.By the way, the blurb behind the tray is the equivalent of a slap in the face considering what we were given here. Merry Christmas!"
5,Better than the original,"The CD is basically the original Let it Be without Phil Spector's ""wall of sound"". I find Let it Be better without the ""wall of sound"". Also, it comes with Fly on the Wall, a 20 minute CD that is basically the Beatles messing around with their instruments."
4,Very Interesting Companion To 'Let It Be',"This album has been getting a lot of bad press as 'Paul McCartney's version' of let it be. I disagree with this- but I also disagree with the 'as the Beatles intended it' sticker on the CD's packaging. Half of the band was dead- so that's not possible. As the band intended it (according to the Beatles Anthology) was to be a live album, and what we have are rough demos and rehearsals that are sonically enhanced by 'Naked' and ""Spectorized"" on the original. Call me an idiot, but I like the new version better for one reason- it sounds like an album, and it sounds incredible. I like the new order of the songs and the lack of strings, choirs, and tape hiss- but I agree it should not be the replacement of 'Let It Be.' Like the 'Fly on the wall' CD that accompanies 'LIBN,' this album is essential listening for anyone who loved the original, and in my opinion, everyone else."
4,More Beatles is Always a GOOD thing!,"So yeah, maybe Paul Mc Cartney tampered with history or maybe he just finally finished an album started all those years ago. Either way, everybody wins! Buy the one you like :) I just wish there was a Mobile Fidelity version onn SA-CD!"
3,A collectible... nothing more,"I am a huge Beatle fan. So, that being said and with all the hype around this CD I was expecting a lot more. All of the songs are virtually as they were on the original recordings. Yes, there are some slight difference in mix, guitar riffs and some lyrics. But they are low key differences and will not blow you away. If you are not a big Beatle fan you may not even notice. Biggest difference is Long & Winding Road without the Phil Spector orchestration. My reaction? A big shrug and a ho-hum. The second disc are snippets from the movie, i.e., chatter, incidental music, etc. All in all, is this a must have disc to listen to versus the original Let It Be recording? No. As a collectible? Yes. It's worth owning as a historical document especially if you are really into Beatle history."
5,A great buy for Beatls fans,"This is truly a great CD for any Beatles fans. [...]They are completely remastered and reworked and sound a whole lot better to.Take The Long And Winding Road. The horrible bass track that appeared in Anthology 3 (and in the original Let It Be release, though it was obscured somewhat by the orchestra) has been completely redone from scratch. The little microphone bumps that were a small distraction, as well as other anomalies in the older versions are gone, and the vocal has been mixed up to a higher volume. The same goes for Let It Be. The vocal is again mixed up higher, and everything else sounds cleaner than what appeared on the Anthology versions. All the anomalies, such as the wrong piano chord at 2:58 have been fixed.The Anthology songs were taken from the original recordings and just copied onto the Anthology series. The Let It Be...Naked songs are completely remastered under the supervision of Paul McCartney, and they sound amazing"
2,Beatles vs Deep Purple,"My two favorite groups, The Beatles and Deep Purple have put out new albums.One is pretty good and one is excellent. Let It Be... Naked (yes, we are living in a Britney world) is a stripped down version (no strings & no horns) of the original 1970 classic. The songs are also in a new running order and have been digitally remixed to sound...GREEEEEAT! The clarity is breathtaking. It sounds as if the Beatles are playing right in your living room. It is less about Phil Spector and more about moving the Beatles into the 21st century. [...]Naked: 2 1/2 stars[...]"
1,As The Rutles said -- Let It Rot,"LIBN is an album that only a hopelessly nostalgic baby boomer could love. But if you weren't born between 1946-1961 and/or you've retained your critical faculties, AVOID THIS MONEY-GENERATING PRODUCT.""Let It Be"" is average by Beatles standards; ""Let It Be...Naked"" is awful by musical standards. These stripped-down versions of songs you already know reveal what the Beatles had become by 1969: bored and boring."
2,BUY THE ORIGINAL LET IT BE ALBUM...,"After hearing this ""naked"" version of the album, to be brief I will only say that Spector's work wasn't wrong. This version seemed to me too short and cold. The ""bonus CD"" adds nothing. At any rate, I prefer the orginal album."
2,These songs are different...how?,"In what seems to be another holiday timed marketing ploy, Let It Be...Naked has been released minus two great Let It Be Tracks but plus Don't Let Me Down. Just different enough, and with a bonus ""Fly on the Wall"" CD of studio conversations and slices of songs, that a true Beatles fan will have to have it. For those of us who like the Beatles but already own all their albums (or CDs, if you prefer), listen to a friend's Fly on the Wall disc - it is certainly interesting to listen to, once. Then move on. Very disappointing overall."
3,"Different, but not better",This presentation is very basic and simple as the advertising stated. It is what you would hear from a live stage performance in a small club. It is sort of like the difference between the acoustic Dylan and the electric Dylan. Whether you think this version is better depends on your taste in musical styles.
2,Seemed a bit overrated in reports,"While always being a fan of the Beatles, was a bit disappointed following all the hype about the release of this CD. Seemed like it was an album of rejected songs from previous albums and did not appear to have the same impact as the red and blue 1960s album releases or white album. Not my favourite!"
4,buy it for the music,"the title of the release? stupid. the cd cover art? terrible! the music inside the cd jewel case? outstanding! disc one clocks in at 35+ minutes, so i can't understand why they opted for a 2 1/2 minute version of Get Back. the original is much better, IMO. why remove maggie mae and dig it? there's still 45 minutes of free disc space left.disc 2 totals twenty minutes. not much here, and again allot of wasted blank space. an opportunist must have saw $ signs when thinking of releasing this. still, the music on disc 1 makes it worth owning."
3,Less than I expected,"Certainly listenable, but I'm not sure it's as good as the original. I'm a big Beatles fan, but I also enjoy Phil Spector, and frankly, I've always thought he got a bad rap about this album. (Apparently, John felt this way, too, as Spector produced a Lennon solo album after this one.)It's pretty in a very different way from the first release, but do you need to own both of them?"
3,"Paul's are better, but....","""Long and Winding Road"" and ""Let it Be"" are better without the Spector schlock, and that's probably the reason why McCartney went ahead with the project. It's burned at him for years that his work was altered like it was by Spector, and without his consent. It could stand to reason that he waited for George's death to finally correct the mistake, but whatever, this is a mixed bag. Pauls' material is better. The rest, not so."
5,I Always Hated Let It Be... and then....,"I think the reason a lot of people are ticked off at this album is because they assumed ""Naked"" would mean an acoustic album, much like a ""Beatles Unplugged.""This isn't what Paul and Mr. Martin were trying to do. They were doing their best to make Let It Be a respectable album, and they did an amazing job.The tracks sound very clear and concise, as if the Beatles were making an actual album,not letting Spector salvage an atrocious recording session.Buy this instead of the original. It's far better. The songs no longer sound dated. On the contrary, they sound practically eternal."
2,Let It Be 2003 vs. 1970,"Unnecessary remastering (by an amateur). That's all that this is. And no, I don't wish that George had remastered ""All Things Must Pass"".On one hand Spector is criticized for his original 1970 version (masterpiece) of ""Let It Be"", and then Paul is criticized for leaving out the guitar solo that Spector put in. Yeah, that makes sense. The one thing that is clear is that John can't hit the high notes on ""Across the Universe"" on either version.The 1970 version stands as the classic because of the nicely produced version of ""Get Back"" that is cut short on this version, ""The Long and Winding Road"" with the great orchestra backing on the original, and ""Let It Be"", with the great distorted guitar solo that I guess Paul thought overshadowed his song."
4,The Beatles Let it Be CD,"This CD from the Beatles came out 10 years ago. The only difference from this version and the original version is that Paul McCartney hated what Phil Spector did to the 1969 version by adding strings to the music. With Naked the strings are removed. I finally decided to get it only to complete my collection.I think that this music of the Beatles on this album really showed that the Beatles were beginning to break up. It was no longer fun to make music together. This album is my least favorite. But as Ringo put it, the next Album Abbey Road they got it together one last time before they went their seperate ways."
1,Talking to the Wall,">Don't believe the hype......from either side.Guess what? The ""other side"" isn't after your money.>Think for yourself, as the Beatles would say.Or rather, as two of the Beatles actually did say: the DEAD two.>The best thing about this reissue, however, is the inclusion of John's glorious ""Don't Let Me Down"" at the expense of the totally superfluous ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae"".Look up ""superfluous"" in a dictionary. ""Don't Let Me Down"" has been continuously available on a Beatles album since BEFORE the original Let It Be was ever released. (How many times do we have to say this before it finally sinks in?) ""Dig It"" and ""Maggie Mae"", on the other hand, are ONLY available on the original Let It Be."
3,It's OK,"2 stars is ""I don't like it"", 3 stars is ""It's OK"". I can't say ""I don't like it"" to anything Beatles. So it has to be 3 stars, OK. I guess if you are the type who examines every nuance in their music you might give it a 4-5. This album is OK for something different, but I enjoy the Beatles music as I remember it 35+ years ago, 13 original albums, plus the singles. I guess we can be happy that they aren't taking every out-take and every mix that Michael Jackson did and popping out new albums."
5,C'mon people - can't you appreciate great music??,"I am very disappointed that there have been many people writing bad reviews when they don't understand or feel the real jist of Let It Be Naked. Many of rhe UK writers as well as many of the US writers are all thinking alike as well. The Beatles are giving you (1) a choice, (2) their history and (3) great music when there's nothing to listen to these days. That's why greatest hits and best of collections are selling well. Why? Because, and I'm only 38, there is so much [junk] these days that we all have been suffocated with Eminem, Josh Grobin, Cleine Dion and Britney. Why do you think the Rolling Stones and The Who are still out there (....as well as what's left of the Beatles). To bloody save us."
2,Let It Be!,"Why such a fuss is being made over The Beatles ""Let It Be - Naked"" CD is a mystery to me. Growing up with The Beatles this album came as a great disappointment to me in 1970 - especially after their masterpiece ""Abbey Road"". The remixing and elimination of the Phil Spector strings are definitely a great improvement but as a long time fan of one the greatest band ever I advise you to save your money and pass on this CD. PS - The ""Fly On The Wall"" bonus disc is a montage of The Beatles' conversations and musical snippits from the ""Let It Be"" sessions which is nothing special."
1,Not the act you've known for all these years...,"When I first heard about this release, I, like countless listeners I'm sure, was really looking forward to hearing the GET BACK album that was pulled shortly before the record was to hit shelves; this is not that album, despite the schilling of the hyperbolic sticker on the cd. Instead, what we get is yet another attempt by Mr. McCartney to re-write the legacy of his former band. How else to explain the suddenly thundering bass levels at the expense of Harrison's now muted leads? As someone who always gave McCartney the benefit of the doubt, his actions of the past few years have served only to strengthen claims by Lennon and Harrison as to the selfish egotism of his character. LET IT BE - NAKED is NOT The Beatles, it's PAUL McCARTNEY's BEATLES. Perhaps this time, fans should Listen to What the Man Said and not give him their money."
5,"Actually,4 and 3/4 stars......","Simply because the last 15 seconds of ""get back"" was edited out,which should have been included! Its inevitable that this version will be compared to the 1970 version for the next 50 years,so heres my take...Don't let me down is included,hooray,maggie mae and dig it have been dropped,smart move,many songs sound very different without Phil Spectors touch,which I kinda miss. The reality is this- Let it be 2003 is still light years better then anything out there today,with some of the Beatles greatest work (3 no 1 singles,get back,let it be, long and winding road),plus across the universe and two of us... I strongly recommend this version and the 1970 version!!!"
3,Let it Be Naked...........and copy protected,"This CD is not radically different from the original release tho' ""Across the Universe"" sparkles as never before. I defy anyone to listen to the additional CD material more than once. My gripe with this release is the copy protection employed. I have had nothing but trouble running it on my work computer."
5,Not Necessarily Better Sound but More Unique and Simple,"Although I think Spectars wall of sound with heavy strings made the ""Long and Winding Road"" a classic it was refreshing to hear the Beatles songs in their original format. The prize to me goes to ""Across the Universe"" where Lennon starts with a couple of complicated introductory chords and alone with his guitar he just strums along letting his voice carry this upbeat looking at the future tune with a flurry of lyrics that make one feel its one song that can never be copied succesfully. I also enjoyed Lennon's ""Don't Let Me Down"" which just rocks. I think Lennon gains most on the album while Harrison's adlibs are fun while McCartney's vocals still sound pure. The Fly on the Wall second CD is a collection of Beatle prattle that is interesting along with practice takes. Their rough cut of ""All Things Must Pass"" is fascinating which of course ends up on Harrison's great solo. Well worth it a buy."
2,Not much to get excited about folks.,"Kind of paltry. Kind of odd, too. I'm happy to have different versions of Beatles songs but really there aren't huge differences over what we've heard on the original LIB, Anthology and Past Masters. And a CD has more space than an LP - so why remove any content? The second disc is meaningless and gives us precious little song material. If the title and cover weren't so awful, if the marketing was more honest and if the second disc had been a good collection of the volumous LIB outtakes (some which, if edited skillfully, could make decent new Beatle songs), I would have rated this higher."
2,They Should Have Let It Be,"Unbelievable. How in the world could any competent producer cut the wonderful distorted guitar solo and fills in the Spector produced original version of the song ""Let It Be"" and replace it with the chicken picking version on this album? It sounds like George Harrison's take was removed and McCartney was substituted practicing his pentatonic scales.People interested in the Beatles should just buy the original albums, plus Past Masters. This reconstituted effort after two of the Beatles are now gone is simply re-writing history. 2-stars."
3,Could have been so much more,"let it be naked versus let it bethe plus:-mucho better sound quality (guitars crisper, bass clean & sharp, harmonies more distinct)-includes 'don't let me down'-bonus disc ""fly on wall"" demonstrates how hard it was to be ""a Beatle""the minus:-erases all the hilarious spoken intros & outros (wasn't this the 'original' intent?) (beatles 'live' in studio)-missing the sublunary ""maggie may""-sequencing 'feels' funny- why no other outtakes? (i.e. child of nature etc)- wildly unimaginative cover- the 2 missing Beatles really didn't have a say about all this"
4,Set Free to Speak,"Abuse--no one wants to mention it. But if you've been the victim or love one of the survivors, you hope for answers. Set Free may just be what you're looking for.Jan Coates writes candidly about the struggles of abuse in Set Free. She threads her own story along with six other women in an honest journey to be healed with God's power.Coates does not snap her fingers to invoke spontaneous healing. On the contrary, sometimes the road is long. Jan admits the struggle, explores the road to recovery, and provides resources--all strengths in Set Free.It's not easy to read about abuse, but in this fractured age there are generations of walking wounded who need to know there is hope. Jan Coates and others have been Set Free to speak to the pain."
4,stories of encouragement for abuse survivors,Jan Coates has written a collection of stories from the lives of abuse survivors including herself. She shows the reader how God can take even the worst experience and transform it. This book is encouraging and easy to read. I recommend it for people surviving abuse as well as those who work with them.
5,Brought Healing to my Soul,"This book was a catalyst in my healing journey as I have identified with the women who shared their lives throughout the chapters. I have learned in great depth how much God desires to heal all my wounds as I allow him to shine on the broken areas in my soul caused by sexual and emotional abuse. The truths in this book have set me free from the bondage of my past and shame. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has suffered physical, emotional, and or sexual abuse."
5,Great Durable Product,"My little one just inherited the house alone with the furniture from our friend's daughter who had had it for years. I could not believe how new this house and all the furniture looks!!! There is no paint or stain used, or hardly any on the furniture. This gives me a great peace of mind. Who knows what kind of toxic chemicals might be included in a paint. I would play with the house myself. Great-great quality.Please note, this house does not include the furniture. However, when you buy it separately, you will love it. Good luck and enjoy!"
2,fell apart on us..twice!,"the deck broke off....we called the company and they sent us a new one. the inside room divider broke. called the company again with a list of toys that had broken (play toys) with no response. these toys are pretty, but expensive and don't last."
4,"Great, but I should have thought about it more.","This was a great investment, but after we recieved it, I realized that it was just that, an investment. Very Sturdy and easy to assemble. I just didn't realize how much it costs to get a working set. In hind sight, I just wish I would have gone for a little cheaper set that also came with some furniture. I would definatly recommend it to someone if they are looking to invest in something that will hold up for a while and want to spend the money for accessories."
2,"2 stars for price, misleading photo","Note that other Amazon vendors sell this for $59 with less shipping (free super saving shipping, even); also, the picture here misleadingly shows dolls and furniture included, and they are NOT. The product itself is terrific, but not for this price. Buyer beware!"
5,My First Doll House,I love this dollhouse. It was easy to assemble and is a great size and very durable for our 3 year old. The accessories that are made by Plan Toys are so great and fun and I actually liked the product better in person than I did just looking at it on line. The floor boards were slightly warped upon arrival but i am not sure that could have been avoided with a mass produced product such as this. We love it and so does our daughter!
4,Review for Bounce Back from Banckruptcy,Excellent book with lots of detailed information for somebody that needs this type of information. Highly recommended for someone like be that has no knowledge of this subject.
3,Girls in tragic 80s jeans,"Released in 88, this Rohmer flick features a pair of flashdance type hotties, clad in very unfortunate highwaisted mommy jeans, all acid-washed and very late 80s. It's a love quadrangle, of sorts. The men fare much better, fashionwise. They all live in a soulless Parisian suburb unlike anything exposed to most tourists. It looks worse than an American urban renewal nightmare. Some silly relationship posturings comprise the film. Typically French. Nothing happens, but you enjoy the time spent anyway."
4,Pretty nice...works great for ArtRage on iPad,"It IS like writing with a mini-marshmallow on a stick, but it works well for my primary uses. I use it for having customers sign on my iPhone with my Intuit GoPayment credit card solution, and on my iPad with an art painting program called ArtRage. It's a lot like actual painting or drawing. I don't understand why nobody has a good stylus with a small point...but this will do for now."
2,Please read this,"Look I ordered this for my Iphone and i thought I did my research for a working stylus-I guess not. The design is great and slim but funcion? Nope. My brand new Iphone would only pick up its touch when I fully had to compress the rubber ball tip-which to me is useless because I'm pressing fairly hard and it would be faster to type with my finger at that point. I needed something with just ""TOUCH"" and didn't need to be compressed in order for the iphone to pick it up. This product sucks."
2,Works poorly,"I wanted a replacement stylus for my Galaxy Note. I can't really accuse them of false advertising, since it doesn't say it fits into the stylus slot, but why does it say it is for the Galaxy Note any more than any other capacitive screens?In any case, my real complaint is that it functions very poorly. It is much harder to grab and drag objects with this stylus than it is with my finger. The built-in stylus works much better.I don't recommend this, even if you want a stand-alone pen-type stylus"
2,Quality not as expected,"I bought a set of TWO other styli for the same price as I paid for one BoxWave stylus (the others are retractable so the tip is covered when not in use). At half the price, the mesh tip of the less expensive stylus is far superior and much more responsive on the screen than the BoxWave tip. The only reason I bought the BoxWave Slimline stylus is because the others are thicker and do not fit in the stylus holder on my Nexus 7 case. I've used a few other BoxWave products in the past and, unfortunately, this is the first one to disappoint."
2,Great until it fell apart,"I got this about a week ago, and had been enjoying it up until a few minutes ago, when I grabbed it, touched it to the screen, and saw that the tip had just fallen off/out of the end of the barrel. I can't find it anywhere, and this stylus (as far as I can't tell) isn't designed to have replaceable tips, so all I can assume is that the adhesive used to fix the tip isn't strong enough.For the record, I always kept my stylus plugged into the headphone jack on the bottom of my nexus 7 when not in use, and never stuffed it into a small space that might have rubbed it loose."
2,not worth it,"This book was okay. It is layed out beautifully, but the information is very basic. There is nothing in this book that you can not pull off the web with minimal effort. I suggest another more comprehensive book rather than this one."
2,"Managing Intellectual Capital. What, how and by whom?","You are about to realize a misconception between two related but different terms: intellectual capital and intellectual property. Browsing throughout the book you will hardly find any references to intellectual capital, including a brief definition! Thus you should not be surprised by not finding any reference to intellectual capital in the Index. One would expect some heated discussion over this controversial concept before being offered a framework to manage it. Forget it. Despite author's attempt to write about the promising field of IC all sections seem to converge around the intellectual property discussion. The management of intellectual capital is something else than the management of intellectual capital. The wrong audiences may than be easily caught in this trap."
1,CANNOT BY PLAYED ON US DVD PLAYERS,"This is NOT a ""all region"" playing capability. I got mine and it would't play. i got a replacement and it too DID NOT PLAY. I returned it.It was made in Germany"
4,PAL FORMAT: YOU NEED A DVD PLAYER THAT PLAYS PAL,"This DVD is in PAL format. You need a DVD player that plays PAL. Most American DVD players plays NTSC format. Unless you have a multi region player. Having said that, this DVD is not bad. The quality is not the best. The first 5 songs are recorded from a live concert (from their Live album in early 70's). I recognize some of the talking from their early 1970's live album. These first 5 songs are the worse on this DVD when it comes to quality. It's like watching a movie from the 70's with no effort to improve the quality of the film when they transfered it to DVD. I'd give it a C or C+ grade for the first 5 songs. The rest of the songs are much better. Still, it's a good DVD to watch to bring back the memories."
4,"nice compilation, so-so video quality","I like this compilation a lot. Another reviewer has done a good job at describing the contents in detail, so there's not much for me to add other than that I found the picture quality to be a bit disappointing. The colors are extremely washed out on all of the videos, lending them an almost sepia tone quality. Sound quality is decent for videos and concert footage of this era, though, so I would still recommend this dvd. Who knows whether there will ever be another dvd release of this stuff?"
1,Can't finish the game because of bugs,"As others have noted, the game is fun but cannot be completed due to bugs. First is the ""lipmgr.play... lip synch"" error. Also, Erica is unable to sing and therefore can't find the singers. We also called Tech Support and Customer Service numbers provided with the game. They only provide useless prerecorded messages that do not cover the above errors.Do NOT buy this game. Santa got it for my daughter and she is stuck with a half finished game."
1,Another victim of the bug,"My 4 year old girl absolutely loves to play this game, but she is so frustrated, because every time it hits a specific point in the game - she designs a flag, sings to a man, the man sings back, she tries to give him flowers, and poof - it gives this error (LipMgr.play -> EzDlgNone has no loaded lip synch data!) and closes. I tried to uninstall and reinstall. Then I exchanged it for a new disk. Same exact thing is happening with the new one. I am as frustrated as my daughter. What a disappointment. Don't waste your money on this game that doesn't work!"
2,hard to figure out...,"I bought this game for my 5 yr old and thought that it was very hard to get to the next level. If you are thinking of buying this for your child, please think twice. The graphics are very nice and the game is in a nice setting. Just to hard to figure out for your typical Barbie lover!"
3,Good game - has glitches,My 7 year old daughter played this game for 3 hours straight the day we got it. She loves the game but got VERY frustrated when we ran into a software glitch at th 17 th step -- one step away from making the coronation! My suggestion to avoid this is to make sure you use the log the woodsman gives you to cross the muddy patch to collect the toolbox. My daughter did not and she was unable to give the snacks she collected later to the sheep herder. This prevented her from continuing on in the game. I think the log and the snacks must hold the same spot on the ribbon bar. I played the game with her under a different sign on name and had no problem when we used the log to cross the mud.
2,a bit of a let down,"I have to agree with another reviewer, if you know the Mooney Suzuki already, then you most likely will be disappointed. I loved these guys since i heard the self titled CD in 1999. Long Gone are the rough buzzing guitars heard in 'I say I Love You' and 'love is a Gentle Whip'. Now it's a cleaner too intentional 70's sound that seems all too contrived. While I do like a few tracks on this new album, such as 'Alive And Amplified', I found myself missing the signature sound I fell in love with in the beggining. Don't expect to find a great song with a sound like 'A simple life' had. I'm not one of these people that disregards a band because they sign to a major label, I let the music speak for itself. Unfourtunately, the music didn't say much with this release. It comes off as a sort of parody of themselves."
2,What happened?,"This album is a complete let down for all of the long time Mooney Suzuki fans. Instead of the raw fuzzy garage guitar and banging drums, listeners are exposed to over-produced generic FM Rock. The Mooney's songs were engaging in the first place, and anyone with any decent music tastes who bothered to listen to their music would come to like it. The production on ""Electric Sweat"" was definately good enough. There was no reason to go with such a high producer. Also, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LEATHER JACKETS,SOMETHING HAS TO BE THE SAME! I am giving this album 2 stars because it's the Mooney Suzuki and their earlier material is Prime A+ Garage. Hopefully the Mooney Suzuki will realize their mistake and put out another ""Electric Sweat."""
4,Funkified!,"I picked this up for free from the record store I work at, not really expecting much but hoping that it was good. And, I was pleasantly surprised! This album provides some damn good hip-shaking funk and deep sexy soul.The first song is just naughty enough to make me smile, while the title track ""Alive & Amplified"" is a big energy romp through the highs of life.I won't go into much detail after that, it's sort of something you need to experience for yourself."
1,GARAGE ROCK SELLOUT POSERS,"Mooney Suzuki are hilarious. These guys copied their entire shtick from The Makers and somehow managed to score a major label contract in the process. Mooney Suzuki have always been unapologetic (and a bit proud) about various sellouts such as their Coors and Nike commercials, but enough is enough. The Matrix know absolutely nothing about garage rock, and that's made abundantly clear after listening to this horrible record. The only reason they were chosen to produce this pile of crud is because the Mooney Suzuki are the worst kind of sellouts imaginable. They have no true appreciation of rock 'n roll, they just want to make lots of money and they don't care what they have to do to get it. It's truly embarassing. This is what the neo-garage rock scene has become. Where are all the great garage-rockers like The Makers and The Mummies when we need them?"
5,The Premier Primer for the 1990's Balkan Conflict,"If ever there was a book published that covered nearly all the bases on what happened and who was in charge, the dynamics of the countries involved and all the political and military players, this is the book. I've read several books now on the history of the Balkans and the fall of Yugoslavia and this book is probably the least biased by authors who were there and watched it all unfold. The book leaves no doubt that atrocities did occur and that those responsible covered all the bases. There is plenty of blame to go around and plenty of denial by those involved and even those who ignored the plight of Croats, Serbs and Bosnians throughout this disastrous war of ethnic cleansing. Highly recommended if you know nothing or think you know it all."
4,Detailed and objective,"Very detailed, yet easy to read. Very objective. May not appeal to people with 10 sec. sound bite mentality, but for those that seek to understand how this tragedy came about, this is an excellent book."
2,Poorly written book on an important subject,"I'm really surprised at how highly praised this book is! Of course it is an important topic, and the author's know a good deal about it, but the book is VERY poorly organized and filled with inappropriate hyperbole. The authors find it difficult to develop a consistent timeline, and there is no historical overview of the Tito period, which for some of us is perhaps crucial to understanding the structure of the (1980-era) Yugoslav government! I could have used more background on the major players as well. Not a book I would recommend for anyone looking for an introduction to this complex area."
4,Great Facts and Analysis,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Silber and Little bring up the subtle nuances of the war in the former Yugoslavia that have been glossed over in other accounts. It is very detailed without drowning the reader in information. They did a spectacular job of putting the information together in a way that is informative and engaging.My one dissappointment with this text is that it is less and less detailed and sort of tapers of as it comes to an end. The events discussed at the end of the book get less attention while the importance is not diminished.
5,Essential book for anyone interested in modern Balkan history,"If one has to read ONE book. Just one single book to try to understand how did former Yugoslavia disintegrate into tragic chaos and how did everything unfold first in Kosovo, then Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and again Kosovo, this is the book you need to read."
5,"A bit predictable, but still unputdownable","This is what i love about David Morrell-unlike Nelson Demille, Micheal Crichton, or Tom Clancy, Morrell get's right to the point. From the very first page he dives you into the story and you're hooked. I read 200 pages in a row on this, is was so unputdownable. If you like Morrell, read this!"
2,"WHAM! POWIE! - Gosh, what a guy","This book moves along briskly with plenty of short (2-page) chapters for those of us readers suffering attention deficit. I think that's how Mr. Morrell views his reading public; give us a hit a minute before we lose our concentration. I lost mine trying to believe 85 impossible things before breakfast. Steve Decker is ultra one dimensional, but hey, he's in technicolor! Good for a read at the laundromat."
1,Very superficial review of chest radiography.,"This was a very superficial review of chest radiology. The pictures are not optimal for upper level residents and basically this is a good textbook for medical students and allied health professionals. Does have a very nice background introduction, but too much emphasis on chest radiography ""signs."" Would not recommend overall, especially to radiology residents or practing radiologists."
3,solid foreman grill,"I've used a different sized foreman grill in the past (I believe the GR10ABWI which was more square shaped) this grill is really quite rectangular, so it seems like its width is too short. However, in most cases you aren't cooking large, square pieces of food. This gets the job done and has a nice feature of being able to suspend the top part over the food (without touching it) which is good for melting cheese. What George Foreman lacks in creativity for naming his offspring, he surely makes up for by inventing such a great grill!"
3,Small,Its was on sale for a really good price and I picked it up. Wish it was more sturdy but it is not. So I just gifted it to some one else and will be buying another one
1,timer is busted,"Bought this thing for $50 at Walmart.Pros:- Easy to use.- Adjustable heat settings.- Big surface area for grilling for the whole family.Cons:- Timer broke down on me after 3 months of use. I looked at the owner's manual and I guess I committed the cardinal sin of forcing the timer dial off. It's kind of like resetting the trip odometer in a '73 Volkswagon while the car is moving--you'll break the odometer every time. Guess what, George, there's a reason they don't make 1973 VWs anymore. The grill (and the car) have to be smarter than the idiots like me who use them.Conclusion:Who knew that buying a fat reducing grill from an overweight boxer could be such a mistake? Like Mike Tyson said, ""Yes, time flies. And where does it leave you? Old too soon. Smart too late."""
3,Golden age time warp,"Cassandra Chan imports the basics of a Lord Peter Wimsey Golden Age detective story into the 21st Century. Once I accepted that premise and went along for the ride, this was a nice bit of escapist fun: detection with some romantic interruptions.The young widow of the title is the prime suspect when her wealthy older husband is murdered. Annette Berowne's a dazzler when it comes to men - including hardworking Scotland Yard detective Jack Gibbons. His friend Philip Bethancourt isn't as bewitched by the lady. Bethancourt is wealthy, well-connected, and enjoys helping the police solve crimes. His hobby irritates his girlfriend, a supermodel.The whole never-never-land of the Golden Age English village whodunit is laid before us, updated with such touches as cellphones, career women, and the frustration faced by an unemployed middle-aged middle manager looking for a job in today's Britain.This book was a good airplane-trip read for me."
1,a sad attempt at an english cosy,"when a non-british writer, without a feeling for the language amd mores of that society attempts a traditional british mystery the result is very banal. the story is set in london but there's barely a mention of it. the characters are supposedly modern but people behave and talk like the edwardians. a very trite book. dont waste your money on it. if i could have rated it lower i would have done so."
4,Has less personality than 'Chemtrek' but still it's fine.,I saw this at the local University library and ran home to order it. It is a cut above standard lab books. It has the personal feel from the author and is enjoyable reading (if you are a chemistry teacher!). I'm using it at the high school level but it is definitely more geared for freshman year undergrad.
4,Beautiful pictures of beautiful ties!,If you are a collector this may interest you. The book is primarily photographs of beautiful collectible ties. There is some history of the tie and labels to look for. All in all is is a pretty book. I had hoped for more information on values but was disappointed in that respect.
4,Nice little picture book,"This is a charming, but ultimately shallow, book. It's something I like to look at when I'm looking for inspiration on vintge style, but there's not much context here. I'd love a bit of socio-history to give it some substance."
5,Great depth in writing,I've read most of Ms.Brookners books and found this one to be typical of her great writing skills.This may have been the best one I've read-just so poignant I couldn't put it down.I'm sure I'll read it again.
3,A Christian by any other name,"I needed to review Lewis' book because I have been in a number of different ""cults"" with some truly great Christians and wanted to see if I'd done myself irreperable harm (according to Lewis) well, seems anything he doesn't understand is a ""cult"" I must read more about this."
5,Great Football Game,"Hi, I really like this game because:1. It's Football!2. The graphics are fair enough3. The backyard teams are cool and you can make your own player (you can only name them out of the ""nicknames"" they provide)4. They have pro players (obviously)5. And like most Gba games the controls are simpleOne thing I don't like is that there is not much difference between the levels so all levels are fairly easy. They are not to easy to enjoy though.If you don't mind please rate my review."
4,great for kids,The learning curve is easy overall. The only problem I've seen is smallchildren may have problems kicking a field goal or P.A.T or the K.O. Thistakes some dexterity that a child under six may not have. The game gives arecommended play for each down so very easy to play. I liked it. Animationvery simple.3 stars for animation. 5 stars for fun. Overall a four!
3,Still Works But With Glue,"As much as I like these retractable cables, I think the regular pulling on them stresses them more than regular cables, as I've had others fail. When the white insulation started cracking and exposing the wires at the connectors, I put a bunch of glue there, and this has kept it working. For the money--it's still a good deal."
3,Good spot meter attachment,"This is a spot meter attachment for theSekonic L-358 Flash Master Light Meter. It averages a light reading from five degrees coverage, which for me gets better results than from the far too narrow one degree attachment. Well built.Downsides:Comes in a soft case that lacks a belt loop, which means some other pouch or pocket must be used when using a different head on the L-358.If you frequently switch between 1, 5, or 10 degree spot metering, consider instead a different light meter that has these builtin, as exchanging different heads on the L-358 is a bit cumbersome."
1,DIM,"I just installed these yesterday and was Extremely disappointed with the light output.If you're in high school and you're looking for some cheezy blue bulbs to (try to) impress a girl, you might like em.If you're looking to illuminate the road in front of you, Go with something else.I have these in a pair of hella vision 7"" round lights. the original 55 watt bulbs were somehow waaay brighter than these. Very Disappointing."
3,Its ok :-/,"My sister bought this for my daugter for Christmas. She was very excited when she got it! One rainy day she decided to watch it. She was a little disapointed with the episodes. They are always shown on T.V. plus it doese'nt even come with many episodes. When she watched the extras she was sad to see how short they were. Well my last hope was the music vid. included, but sadly it was only Billy R. Cyrus singing. All in all it wase'nt the best Hannh DVD. I hope One In A Million is better!"
4,Great Christmas gift for young girls,We gave this video as a Chritmas gift to a 9 year old and she loved it as well as her 5 year old brother!
2,Rapped Out,"I definitely am surprised about how many rap collaborations can really be outrageously out of context. I'm surprised in R. Kelly especially, because he has had some great songs in his career. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those collaborations. For Ja Rule, he also has overused that process not in what he makes as a collaboration, but who he has collaborated with, Ashanti. Their three-way collaboration Wonderful really isn't a very well put collaboration in Rap music. It sounds a whole lot wimpy, and not really a great song at all. This is one of the worst collaborations this year. As for Ja Rule, he really should try other people to mix great music with. That goes the same for Ashanti.Song: D-"
2,Disappointed,"I was excited to give this towel as a baby shower gift for a friend. When I received the towel, I was disappointed, because it was a fair bath towel quality and the duke portion was ironed on the towel. The imprint looks like it will flake off after multiple washings. Not a good quality product I would have liked to give as a give. Great concept , just needs more quality into it."
4,The Westing Game,"This book was a great book. Although it can be a little confusing, it keeps you wanting to read it. It is a great story which talks about sixteen people gathering around for the reading of Samuel W. Westing's will. Only the will ends up being a game. You have to find out who killed Samuel W. Westing and who the real heir is. Do you want to play the game? Then read the book!"
4,Enjoyable,This is the second time that I read this book and will put it back on the book shelf to read again. It is the story of the Beauregard family which consists of many different character who all seem guilty of something. It is up to Sarah Deane and her husband Alex to help the police solve the mysteries. The characters are well developed and the author has a smooth writing style. The novel is quite suspenseful and never dull.
2,thank goodness the book was free,"I didn't know I was reading a religious book until about 1/3 of the way through. I'm sure this is a good book for the naive mormon girl who doesn't know the real world. The way the main character was depicted in the begining makes his transformation seem unfathomable. If Cheyenne's parents raised her so independent and confident, why would they question her ""boyfriend"" like she's not an adult and she's not smart enough to make her own choices. I didn't think the storyline was believeable and I believe this book should be kept in the mormon family. If you're not mormon, don't even bother picking it up, not an intelligent read."
4,Interesting,Knights and Castles is very resourceful especially if you are doing a research project. It is full of information that is engaging and makes you feel as if you are living at the time. I loved the bold pictures and it was easy to find certain information I needed.
3,Lazy Boy - Underwear goes inside the Pants,"This is a funny as song. Its got sweat words that will make u laugh. But lazy boy also makes some good points towards. Obesity in America and Homeless people, Basicly just teasing America thats what makes it more funny. Really a funny song get your hands on it now."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"This book is a sad copy of The Italian by Ann Radcliffe. I purchased this book for a Gothic Lit class, and upon opening the book to read it found myself greatly confused by what I saw. This book is a compilation of scanned text from an original version of the novel, reprinted with absolutely NO editing. Because there is NO editing, this edition is full of random symbols, gaps in pages, missing information, and is separated into ""Sections"", which has no particular meaning in regards to the flow of the novel.Chapter headings are located within the main body of text, and very hard to find. I have purchased a different version of this novel since discovering the sad state of this one. I repeat: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is absolutely terrible, and in my opinion shouldn't even be available for purchase on Amazon."
1,A Terrible Edition,"I want to caution anyone from buying this edition of The Italian. The print is incredibly small - I suppose in the publisher's effort to make the book appear more attractive by limiting the number of pages. If your eyes can take the strain, go for it; mine couldn't."
2,too much prose,"This book has all the makings of a very good plot and could have been very gripping if it had not been slowed down by all the prose and flowery descriptions of scenery etc. These were all beautifully written but to me slowed the story down to the point where I could not finish the book. Once again, I find it totally unrealistic to believe that a man who only sees a woman a couple times could fall so madly in love with her so as to endure all that this couple went through. I guess am too much of a realist to really enjoy novels of this type."
3,good old valentino flicks,"great old rudolph valentino films.wanted to see the married virgin 1918 never seen it before ,others i have .one problem i have is the music score on all the films ,just awful whoever did the scoring did not even see the films .also blood and sand 1922 is missing a couple of scenes because i have it on vhs and i did not see the scenes on the dvd.3 good extras shorts ,one a mini bio,second valentino judges a beauty contest and third another film a society sensation 1918 this print is very bad scratchy, very bright you cant see the faces in some scenes, very chopped up editing but its 1918 .but good films if you like to see valentino at the beginning of his career the married virgin 1918 and near the end, the eagle 1925."
5,Awesome product!,I have tried many probiotics before and Vibra-Gest is the best. My husband and I are off all prescription medicine and only use this.
4,An interesting view of WWII on the island of Borneo,I saw this movie when it first came out and liked it. I saw it a few times later on HBO but it was only just released on DVD. Why it takes some films so long to make it to DVD is a mystery to me but I'm glad this one finally did. The story covers the life of an American deserter (Nick Nolte) during WW2 who becomes the leader of the inland tribes of Borneo headhunters and joins forces with a British intelligence officer (Nigel Havers) to fight the occupying Japanese army.
3,Not very realistic.,"An American setting himself up as king in the middle of Borneo during WWII? That's a bit of a stretch. Although there was actually a white rajah of Sarawak (Borneo) at the time, who was living in exile, it is really difficult to imagine a GI fleeing the Philippines to wind up in a native paradise. But that's Hollywood...Overall, unrealistic with good scenery, and a seemingly good ending because the bad guys lose and the good guys win."
1,Dances with Dayaks?,"I am watching this in HD on cable and it is one cheesy movie. Badly acted, incredibly cliched attempt to make a Dances With Wolves in Borneo. When Nolte is in a good movie he's good and when he's in a cheese factory he is awful."
2,A disappointing effort by a good author,"I have read several books by Anne Mather, and this one was definately not one of her better efforts. I felt that both characters were too wishy washy over their feelings, and there never seemed to be any real communication between them. They would start to discuss their feelings or their relationship, then they would be interrupted, and that was it, conversation over. I felt that Ms Mather didn't really know how to get the 2 lovers back together and she was in a rush, so she just decided to forget all the previous issues they had spent the entire book worrying over, and had Oliver and Laura announce their love for each other right at the end, so we could have a happy ending. This book is definately not a keeper, and I was very disappointed because I know Anne Mather can do so much better."
2,In a word - Suckage!,What can I add that hasn't already been mentioned in the previous reviews....except that the author is challenged in coming up with new twists to her vaguely incestuous plots!Don't waste your time on this one. At the end you'll be as confused as her characters and wish you could have a few hours back!
2,The Demon Weed?,"I sympathize with those having trouble with marijuana addiction, I really do. But, this book was so alarmist that it made me think that many marijuana smokers would doubt its validity. Judging from other reviews of this book, this seems to be the case. There might be some good info in this but it seems really outdated. Perhaps the author needs to write the 2012 edition. And basically I do agree with her that pot is not the benign substance that many insist it is. For many people, especially those not developmentally ready for this recreation, it becomes a lifestyle and an unproductive, unhappy one at that. Sorry, fellow weed smokers."
1,Reefer madness,"Don't waste your time or emotional energy reading this book. The book is just a sump of half-truths and lies. This book is an extension of the reefer madness mentality and United States Government anti-marijuana propaganda machine. To quote the nazi propaganda minister of 1939, ""Lie, lie, lie something bound to stick."" This is what this book attempts to do. Nothing hurts more than a lie and this book is full of them."
1,I don't have time to be brainwashed,"I read an excerpt from this book, the first few pages on Chapter One: A Good Hard Look At Marijuana. And what can I say. It's all scripted. Just another book from the government-produced drones out there. If you want to be swayed to one side, the side of the ""good law-abiding"" non-thinking anti-rebellious people of the United States, then read this book."
1,Wow--I can't believe I wasted my time even checking this book out from the library,"What a joke... This author is obviously lacking in her research skills.Substantial research exists regarding marijuana and addiction. While the scientific community has yet to achieve full consensus on this matter, the majority of epidemiological and animal data demonstrate that the reinforcing properties of marijuana in humans is low in comparison to other drugs of abuse, including alcohol and nicotine. According to the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), fewer than one in 10 marijuana smokers become regular users of the drug, and most voluntary cease their use after 34 years of age. By comparison, 15 percent of alcohol consumers and 32 percent of tobacco smokers exhibit symptoms of drug dependence.And I think it is good to note that marijuana was only a ""gateway"" drug when it became illegal."
1,research!,"for those who are against cannabis, my suggestion is to do your own research in a non-bias and open mind. after researching everything about cannabis then decide. observe you surroundings, use logic and commonsense. be a thinking person! search for the truth! dont be manipulated by the evil people! open your eyes america! open your eyes!"
1,Pure Bull,"This book is pure bull. Propaganda served up hot and nice from your friendly government. Reader be warned,it will waste your reading time."
5,"A funny and interesting read..Arlene Vanderpoel, Schenectady NY","An excellent start in her first fiction novel. Fischkin takes us from Long Island to Ireland and gives a wonderful look into the world of journalism. Her characters are funny and endearing. As I know the ""Real Mulvaney"" and am familiar with some of he other real-life characters, it was fun for me to try to figure out what was true and what was untrue. Her sharp wit and obvious love for her husband, the egotistical but loveable Jim Mulvaney and his escapades, keep you turning the pages. I couldn't put it down and can't wait for the sequel."
5,A great way to learn for the beginner,"I took some programming classes back when I was in college, but never really consider myself to be a programmer. Later, I needed to learn Java since I had to manage a software upgrade project that was going to involve Java. I wanted to be competent enough to be able to look at the code and know what the heck was going on. This book is aimed at people like me who are real beginners and like to have the code broken down and explained line by line. The author does a very good job of explaining the concepts in a way that beginners can understand (that's rare, and is the reason why I gave it five stars).Having said all of that, this book is a little out of date, but I'd still recommend it as a good first book that can be supplemented later with newer references to fill in the gaps.The author published another book in this same series (""No Experience Req'd"") on C++ that is also very good, with a similar title. I'd recommend that one as well if you need to learn C++."
1,Java compiler does not work,I bought this book thinking I was going to learn Java. I haven't been able to get the java compiler to work. I followed the directions word for word and it does not compile from .java to a .class.
5,The Best Book Ever,You have to buy this book I was so dumb I could't even make something good in Quick Basic but with this book I can make exelent looking programs and applets
1,Reclamo,Hace más de dos meses que compre el CD y al dia de hoy no lo he recibido y no encuentro modo de reclamar a traves de la web
4,"Baby Deer, Caribou, Elk and Moose","Deer Growing Up in the Wild is one of many volumes in the Books For Young Explorers series published by the National Geographic Society. This book portrays how baby deer, caribou, elk, and moose are reared in the wild and some of the hardships they face. The last two pages of the book provide detailed descriptions of North American deer and their relatives. In this final section we learn about the ranges of North American deer and their relatives, their life spans, their diet and digestion, seasonal migrations, and the difference between horns and antlers. The many color photographs and easy-to-read narrative make this book ideal for your young animal lover."
5,An astute observer spins engrossing tales of animals' lives,"I first read this book as a very young reader, almost sixty years ago. Seton's ability to identify with the wildlife he studies,but with a minimum of anthropomorphism or sentimentality, and then write touching, exciting mini-dramas is enhanced by his role as an observer who does not inject himself as a foreign influence in their lives.I'm buying copies of the hardcover edition for my grandchildren, for this book will be read more than once, and kept for a lifetime. Get it before it goes out of print again. Robert H. Tyrka, Sr. rtyrkasr@chesint.net"
1,Rachel's Man,"I felt that this movie was not a good rendition of the story of Jacob. It is definitely not a movie for Bible purest, and the cover of the movie is misleading. The cover for the DVD box is taken from the movie entitled,""Jacob"", starring Matthew Modine. I was very disappointed. I would not recommend this movie."
1,Don't waste your time.,"This is probably the worst biblical film I've ever seen...boring, boring, boring. Mickey Rooney was an extremely poor choice for his role.I give it one star because the director had the sense to include Leonard Whiting (a very fine actor) among the cast...too bad his talent was wasted on this horrible film. I believe Leonard Whiting retired as a movie actor following this film. Who can blame him? British and American movie directors were fools to let his talent slip away...a great loss for everyone who enjoys good acting on film. Why he was not offered better roles, I will never understand."
3,An entertaining adventure at sea,"Nicholas Allan (Nick), the narrator, tells the story of his friend Guy Edwards. Guy, a successful seaman, lived for fifteen years with Karen, a producer for BBC radio. Guy possessed a thirty-eight foot yacht named ""Rolissa"" and one day he undertook a solo voyage to Spitbergen in the Barents Sea. Before the voyage, Guy used to be a boastful and confident man, even defiant at times, courageous and determined at heart. But when he returned from Spitbergen, he was a changed man, as though he had been damaged by the experience. He was depressed, hardly talking to Karen, in fact rejected her with a strange finality. One evening, Karen found Guy dead in his office - he had shot himself.As Karen and Nick embark on the ""Rolissa"" to retrace Guy's adventure in Norway one year later in order to understand what could possibly have transformed the man to such an extend, they are quite unaware of the terrifying adventure which lay ahead of them."
2,pretty meh,I was hoping this would replace my current case. it's really too slippery though. quality is ok. the white lines are pretty ugly imo.
3,good bumper,"This is a good case to use if you want to protect your phone, and not cover it. This case leaves the back and front exposed, and while the sides are protected, I can't help but feel like it will be damaged from fallilng."
1,Blocks cell/wifi signal.,"Full bars will become 2 bars. Enough said.Also extremely bulky, make sure to get those plastic screen protector for both the FRONT & BACK if you use this."
1,Terrible,Terrible case. Got in on sale but am sending it back. It is NOT worth even $1. It decreases your signal on the iPhone and the case feels cheap. DO NOT BUY THIS CASE!!
2,Won't work if you're in weak signal spot,The design seems okay. got the feeling of thicker phone in your hand. the phone sleep button hard to get to.I work in the building where I get very weak signal. This case with aluminum trim kills it completely.
2,I would not recommend this case...,"I had a silica gel case before this, it was much thicker and not as aesthetic appealing.The quality of the case seems okay, and it's sturdy enough to withstand normal wear and tear. The shiny finish does provide the high quality feel.However, the shell of the case is made out of aluminum, it drastically reduced the cellphone and wifi signal.My iPhone 5 seems drain battery a lot quicker after using this case (since it's constantly trying to find signals)The depth it provide to reach to the power button seems okay, but for the volume buttons are just too hard to reach.Overall, I would not recommend this case, there just simply better ones out there."
5,Fresh Approach,"This is one of the most unique Steel Guitar projects ever recorded. From Country to Mexican, from waltzes to Hawaiian and Movie Themes, there's a little bit of everything, played with musical mastership. Who ever thought about the Star Trek Theme being a Steel Guitar instrumental? Kayton Roberts' version of ""Bells Of St. Mary"" is simply beautiful, the whole recording mixes styles so well that listening to the record is pure pleasure."
5,Refreshing,"The sense of history that came alive in these pages made this book impossible to put down. The reader was able to learn so much more about these women and children than any other Titanic book. It includes passages on the different classes and different ethnic groups that travelled the Titanic and their fate. The only fault I had with this book were the captions under the pictures of Titanic artifacts. Such as, ""Could this artifact belonged to this passenger?"" The author did a bit too much speculation in this respect to make this a true historical treatise. But all in all, this is the best Titanic book I have read."
3,Good theme-More research needed,"I am so glad someone took the time to acknowledge the women and there stories. But I do wish more time and correct information was put into this project. I found at least three stories and I have not finished it yet have been told with the information that was given at the time, and not which was later proven to be the truth on the future lives and death's of some of the women who's stories were told here. Althought not always pretty the truth is available for those who seek to find it and should have been included here."
5,TITANIC FOUNTAIN OF KNOWLEDGE,"JUDY GELLAR HAS WRITTEN ONE OF ""THE"" TITANIC BOOKS. UNTOLD STORIES OF HAPPINESS AND HEARTBREAK FILL EVERY PAGE. THIS BOOK IS CONSIDERED IN TITANIC CIRCLES AS ONE OF THE DEFINITIVE VOLUMES OF KNOWLEDGE."
3,Can't figure out why my 5yo loves this book!,"My 5 year-old loves this book! He has checked it out from our school library twice. While I think the illustrations are fun and fanciful. The plot seems to go in so many different directions at once. I like the ending where he battles the moths, but I can't figure out why the moths have him housesit and then are so angry with him for reading their books. Additionally, I'm not sure how the dad's injury is at all necessary. Nevertheless, my son loves this book and I can't count how many times I have read it! Now I leave it to the older siblings!"
3,Drifters,"I, too, used to go to Cal Poly, SLO. The first time I saw these guys was at the Great American Melodrama, in Oceano, in the midst of a terrible Pacific rainstorm. They were singing Russian River.Later I saw them many times at the old Spindle, by the mission. Great music."
3,Doesn't fit 2001 Honda Accord EX V6,"Even though Amazon and the parts company say this is the part for my car, this is definitely a size too big. Both ends of the PCV won't go in. The corresponding part is actually Fram PCV 388 - you can find this at O'Reilly Auto. I give 3 stars b/c I assume that when this part fits someone's car, it'll actually work as it's intended."
5,A great first bilingual book,A great first introduction to a Spanish/English book. The words are simple enough for me (a non-Spanish speaking person)to figure out. The message is wonderful in both Spanish and English!
2,Okay,"This book in Spanish & English goes through saying I love you son, I love you rabbit etc. It has fine illustrations and is simple and easy to read. It wasn't worth owning for us; check it out at the library first to see if you like it. I also didn't like the last page: we love the earth & the earth loves us!"
4,Voices from the past.,"When Declan Fitzgerald saw Manet Hall as a student, he was enchanted with the old house even though it was in a state of total disrepair. When he saw it again as a mature, wealthy lawyer, he was determined to own it and restore it to its former glory.During the restoration process, he becomes uneasily aware of other presences in the house and even the sound of voices but is determined not to be frightened off by them. His old college friend introduces him to his cousin Angelina Simone, an attractive bar owner who not only helps him to unravel the mysteries of Manet Hall but also to find out her connection with the house and its history.I found this to be an intriguing story which holds you to the last pages."
2,Disappointed me,"Nora Roberts is one of my favorite writers. She's written such wonderful & suspenseful stories thru the years that everytime any of her copies hit the shelves, I'm among those who get a copy immediately. My main problem w/ this book is that it's anti-climatic. The story is pretty good, but the ending was so horrible. I don't understand how such a good book could end so disastrously. I expected more from this book I guess."
4,A Romance About A Man,"I think one of the things I like most about Nora Roberts is the way she portrays men. Somehow, though she makes them romantic, they are still... guys.This is the story of Declan, a guy who was a lawyer, in Boston, of ""the"" Boston Fitzgeralds, engaged to be married. Then he decides that he does not love his fiancee, pretty much hates his job, and needs a BIG change.He comes to see that he had been making decisions based on what his family wanted for him.He buys an old run-down mansion in the deep south. It's complete with ghosts and cool neighbors. He remodels the house through the book, solves a 100 year old mystery, and wins the girl (no spoiler there, I'm sure).And though he loves the heroine long before she loves him, though he questions his own sanity with the whole haunting thing, he is never less than a very strong, male man.Great summer read!!!(*)>"
4,Charming,"What Declan doesn't know when he buys the house he's always wanted is that he won't be living there alone. Although previous occupants of the house are long dead, they have not gone far. Through Declan's relationship with Lena and other supporting characters, the stories of past and present are imaginatively worked out. The ""good guys"" in ""Midnight Bayou"" are engaging and very charming. The villians are all properly detestable. Although the paranormal theme got a little confusing once or twice and the ending would have been better if Roberts had described what happened more fully, I enjoyed reading the book and intend to read it again in the future."
5,Loved it!,"I loved this book! I waited impatiently for the paperback to come out and was not at all disappointed. Midnight Bayou is a dark, romantic suspense and an example of Nora Roberts at her very best. The paranormal elements are intricately woven into the plot. The setting was great, from the excesses of Bourbon Street to the haunted, gothic mansion in the bayou. Declan Fitzgerald was an enchanting romantic hero and Lena a strong, but vulnerable heroine. Midnight Bayou is now among my top 5 Nora Roberts' books, along with Montana Sky, Homeport, Sanctuary, and Carolina Moon."
1,Bad,"Ghost stories can be fun and exciting. This was boring and weird. I admitt I don't understand re-encarnation at all and find stories where the hero and heroine are ""reborn"" or take over other people's bodies rather creepy. But I thought if anyone could sale me on the story it would be Nora Roberts. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to. First off the good/twin bad twin seemed like too low of a cliche for Nora Roberts to stoop too. All thrown together maded for a very boring and weird story."
1,Not her best,"Nora Roberts is a great romance writer, but this is not one of her great works. She enters the realm of the pre-Katrina New Orleans with this romance/mystery novel but as an outsider to that society she is unable to capture its actual nature (believe me, as an insider to the pre-Katrina New Orleans, I know about that lifestyle). She makes horrible mistakes in her New Orleans geography and lifestyle then compounds those errors with the fact that in this novel at least she seems to forget about the basic differences between men and women! Considering her fame as a romance writer I find some her writing not only bad, but actually bizarre! I realize that a ghost story is somewhat bizarre by nature but she takes it to an absurd point! As you can tell I found this novel disappointing and do not recommend this book. Nora Roberts should leave this sort of writing alone and let Anne Rice write about the haunted houses in New Orleans."
5,Sweet Story,"I loved this book, I prefer ghost stories and this is one of my favorites. I loved the twist and I'll leave it at that so as not to spoil this book. Just a great book, sweet storyline, and very beautiful descriptions of the land, the house, and the people. Very good read."
3,A question,"I picked up this book because the plot seemed intriguing, just my type of story, New Orleans and ghosts. I didn't find Lena too appealing, and the ending was definitely too abrupt. What was that all about? Ms. Roberts, please read these negative reviews! I was disappointed because it could have been better. My question: I thought Lucien and Julian killed each other with a knife, then later they said that Lucian drowned himself. Did I miss something?"
3,Not Down on the Bayou!,"As a native of New Orleans I was very anxious to read this book set in my hometown. I was very disappointed to discover that Miss Roberts did not research typical New Orleanians. The constant reference to friends as ""cher"" is very rare in New Orleans, particularly between two young Harvard Law grads! Also,buying beignets and bagels together is unheard of.I read all Nora Roberts books and am usually sad when they come to an end. Not this time! Not only was the book a slow read but I almost had to force myself to finish it. Give me the MacGregors!"
4,Midnight Bayou,Another great story from Nora Roberts. She never fails to give a good book. I have been a fan of hers for a very long time. Keep them coming!
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed this book. I liked the two storylines of the couple from 100 years ago and their counterparts today.I felt the tension built well I liked the fact that Declan told Lena (Angelina) that you have live with some problems (her mother) but it doesn't reduce your own value.The end I found a little weaker than the rest of the book, which is the only reason I am not giving five stars.Definitely a book I will keep and read again."
4,I enjoyed this book but.........,"As my title says I have to say I did enjoy this book and would recommend it. It had Ms Roberts usually wonderfully drawn characters and attention to detail. The Hero and Heroine are delightful and the supporting characters were as interesting as the main characters. The pace and suspense of the story made a terrific page-turner, but what a let down at the end! It was as if the story just rang out of steam, I remember looking at the dwindling pages at the end of the book and thinking the story will never be resolved satisfactorily in the few pages left and I was right. If ever a book suffered for the lack of another chapter its this one, what happened the mother-in-law from hell and her evil son? Did Lucian redeem himself? Sequel perhaps....?"
1,Grossly disappointed,"I have been buying her books since she started out with the monthly paperbacks; I pick up her hardcovers frequently. I think the book was an insult to her normal writing; usually her suspence is excellent and when you start to read a book, you don't want to put it down. The ending was rediculous; men having babies; don't think so. Would like to see a revision, with a new ending. Wrote a short note on this book in January; forgot to rate; deninitely didn't want any misunderstanding. It isn't worth even a l."
2,Midnight Bayou Falls Well Short of Expectations,"I have read a ton of Nora Roberts' books, and I had high hopes that this one would be as great as some of her previous works. While I do find her books a bit formulaic, they are still entertaining. However, this one was just not as good as her previous books in the same romance/suspense genre, such as Sanctuary and River's End. Her female character was rather flat and undeveloped throughout the novel. The entire book seemed like a remix of various stock characters from earlier novels, mixed and matched to provide a new story. The ending lacked her usual unexpected twist, and if you have seen the movie ""Dead Again"" you will guess it long before it occurs. I really expected a little more originality from Nora on this one, but that was expecting too much."
2,"Honestly, Nora, what were you thinking?","I have spent a small fortune on Nora Roberts books, but if this is a sample of what I have to look forward to after all the years of loyalty I have shown her, I will say good-bye now. I have never been so disappointed in one book as I have been in this one. The storyline is so unbelievable, even for a supernatural tale, that it was extremely difficult for me to continue reading this rediculously written novel. ""Ick"" is all I can say. I think about all the time I spent on this book, and it truly makes me angry. What a silly concept - as I said before, ""Nora, what were you thinking?"" If anyone out there wants to read a real romance, pick up The Color of Revenge by Millicent Hart. Don't waste you time with Midnight Bayou. Spend it doing something you like - not reading this trivial junk!"
2,Not worth the read,"This book was too similar to the ""In the Garden"" trilogy in which the house is being haunted and the people that live in the houses are trying to figure out the pasts of the ghosts that are in the houses, blah,blah,blah"
2,can someone please explain the ending of this book to me?,"I have read the majority of Nora Roberts books and looked forward to this one because I had a weeks vacation and could take the time to enjoy it. I did find the premise interesting but it got a little weird toward the middle and relly strange at the end. I still don't understand what happened to Lena's mother and kind of thought that she would have been the troublemaker at the wedding. It just seems to have fizzled out. I couldn't believe it when all of a sudden the hero became the heroine. If Lena was the hero, and I was Declan or whoever he was supposed to be, I would have wished her/him/it a fond farewell without a backward glance. I hope Ms. Roberts slows down with the next book and writes out a COMPLETE rough draft. I felt like I needed cliff notes for this one."
5,A Haunting Read,"The Midnight Bayou is a wonderful mix of ghost, romance and humor. This book reminds the reader how we all connect in this life or in our past. It was haunting in so many ways I couldn't wait to get back to the book to find out what the next turn would be. This book needs one more chapter to satisfy all the reader - but still a great book. If you enjoy mystical storylines and romance you will also enjoy Heaven and Earth, Face the Fire, Dance upon the Air (Three Sisters Island Trilogy)."
3,three of my favorite things,"Books that feature ghosts, the Old South, and old houses as a character are three of my favorite things topics. Roberts put all three in this new novel. Good point: Interesting twists on the ghosts....I kept saying no, no...but it was true. Bad point: Not enough about the ghosts and their lives in the early 1900s. Still, a quick and fun read; you won't need to keep the lights on for this one."
3,Not what I hoped for,I was excited to read this book. I was hoping it would be spooky. The book was easy to predict and was not that exciting. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,Ending was disappointing,"While there were the wonderfully-drawn characters, the ending a very lame and unfulfilling. It was abrupt and I didn't get the feeling of completion. Still love Roberts, just not as good as usual."
2,horrible ending-,I did enjoy this book up to a point but when I reached the end I was very disappointed!
2,HO HUM,"I have been a Nora Roberts fan for years and have read everything she and JD Robb write. This book is not her best. The charactors were not interesting, only her attention to detail made the book acceptable.I say wait until paperback or it hits the used list."
2,Kind of a dissapointement,"I usually love her books. But this one, it fell short of her usually high standerds. I could swallow the gender switching ghosts, but for Abby & Julian to just ""rest in peace"" after all that. It left me kind of annoyed!! She put so much of them into the story that I expected more in the ending. As for the relationship between Dec & Lena, well it seemed that they go through this ""spiritual cleansing"" toward the end, then everything is just peachy?!?! What was that all about???I will still read her books, as I think she is a gifted story teller. But I am sorry to say that this one just did not do it for me."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Nora Roberts. I gave it a try because the ""haunted New Orleans"" aspect sounded fascinating. Here are some reasons I'm sorry I picked it up:1. Rape scene: The story begins with a rape scene. I don't want rape scenes in romance novels, even when they aren't committed by the hero. With romance like this, who needs real life??2. Language. Bad language doesn't phase me, but I'm not looking for it in a romance novel.3. Strip club. The hero and his buddy spend an evening hitting the strip clubs. Major turn off. Give me a man who is too mature, and has too much integrity, to treat women like sex toys. (Yes, there are plenty of men like that.) And give me a woman with too much backbone to take it.I won't even get into the ""Prince Charming marries the maid"" aspect of the 1900 romance.On the plus side, there is a brave attempt at gender bending in the reincarnation aspect. However, for me it interfered with the romantic mood.It's back to British Chick Lit for me."
1,What's happened to my favorite author?,"For years now, long before she was famous, Nora Roberts has been my favorite author. I read all her books and never has a reprint been a new story for me. I also read J.D. Robb and enjoy that series. I am very unhappy and disappointed with the direction she is now taking. In a very recent book, she wrote of magic, and as a Christian, I found it offensive. In Midnight Bayou, she has turned to reincarnation and the occult, which for those who study the Bible is offensive again. What's with this? I have always purchased Nora Roberts' books, sight unseen as soon as they are released. I won't be doing that anymore. It appears that I must check her books out now before purchasing them to determine content. I fear this has happened because she has made it big and is just spitting them out as fast as possible. Come on Nora, be true to yourself, and your loyal fans. This rating of 1 is a gift; I would have given it a zero."
3,Eh... Okay.,Short and sweet... I really liked the story of this book until the reincarnation part. I wouldn't have minded reincarnation if the same gender was reincarnated to that gender. But male to female and visa versa was just hard for me to grasp.
5,midnight enchantment,"once again, nora roberts creates a world i would very much like to be a part of. although she's focused on haunted mansions before, most notably in the calhoun series, you will not be able to pace yourself and read this book slowly. although i am tempted to write the entire plot out, i won't as it is essential to the book that you read for yourselves and discover the true identity of the ghosts...you will not be disappointed. for this novel, there is no mystery like in carolina moon or hidden treasure as in the calhoun books, but nonetheless, i can guarantee that you will be very well satisfied with the search for love that goes on with Declan and Lena."
3,Main character a little too accepting of ghosts,"ryan's ReviewI think that even though the story is set in New Orleans down in the bayou, Declan was a little too accepting of ghosts. He is from Boston and the first day he moves in, he is like. oh, okay. ghosts. oh well, house is mine now,fool. I could have done with a little more convincing on his part. just to make it more realistic. I mean I can understand how the cajuns would easily believe. The magical/ Paranormal is kind of a part of their charm or whatever. they are used to it. I liked all of the other stuff about this book except for... well.. one other thing. and it's a spoiler... so I cannot tell you. :)"
3,Eh....,It was ok. It held my interest and I liked the main characters enough. I was mostly disappointed with the ending.
3,Disappointed,"I am a huge fan of Nora Roberts. I was just a little disappointed in this book. There was no real plot to the story. I kept waitng for it the story to pick up but it never did. I was left with questions. The story just ended with nothing really resolved, well. . come to think of it they was nothing really to resolve, there was no mystery at all. I come to expect a lot out of Nora's book ad this one just didn't meet my expectations."
5,WOW!!! COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!,"I know some felt that this book was not all that great. However, I must strongly disagreee. I picked it up and could not put it down. I finished it in three nights and for a working mom of two with lots of pets to care for that is pretty close to a miracle. Also, I felt her discription of Louisiana was not all that bad. I just finished Interview with a Vampire and her discription was pretty close to Anne Rice's. Great book, great story! I highly recommend it."
1,Don't buy the Bayou,"I am a huge Nora Roberts fan. I think I own practically every book she has written and have loved almost all of them. However, I found this book to be a HUGE disappointment. It is so incredibly boring that I couldn't wait for it to just be over.There is no suspense to the story as the plot is obvious in the first 40 pages. This follows her rather annoying second in a series paperback book about the 3 witches. I do hope this isn't a trend for her, because one more of this vein and I won't be buying her books again."
1,First and last Nora Roberts I'll ever read,"My first question is... How on earth did this woman get published? This book started out great and I was excited to see the story unfold. As I kept reading, I got more and more frustrated. My friend was reading one of her series and told me that the men in those books were all pizza eating, beer drinking card board cut outs too. Declan got on my nerves.Then the big twist, which I won't spoil if someone is desperate enough to read this, made me shake my head and scoff. Its hard for me to leave books unfinished, so I kept with this one until the very last page... Then I wondered why I had just wasted so much of my life, when I could have been reading something worth my time. Maybe because I hate romance novels, I can't stand Nora Roberts. I can't stand Nick Sparks either."
1,Waste of my time,"This is the second Nora Roberts book I've read, and I enjoyed the first, so was excited to have another to read. Well, this is absolutely the most stupid book I have ever read. I don't know if I'll read another, since I felt like it was such a waste of my time."
2,pretty bad,"I had high expectations when I purchased this overpriced hardcover book, that wasn't worth the discount price I got it for. Usually I only buy paperbacks. The characters of Lena and Declan were awful. Declan was weak and Lena had this fake ""bad girl"" attitude. What's with the overuse of the word ""cher""? Lena just got to be annoying. Declan was just pathetic. I couldn't get into the last half of the book and found myself flipping through the pages just to finish it. The overall storyline wasn't that bad. The whole ghost and reincarnation aspect was pretty interesting and different, but these characters were awful and unbelievable. It got a 2 stars(instead of a 1) because of the potential with the storyline. ..."
4,A New Twist,"A very different book from Nora Roberts. If you're expecting something along the lines of Caronlina Moon or Sanctuary, be prepared. Midnight Bayou fits much better in the ""Romance"" genre than the ""Romantic Suspense"" genre. Roberts also delves much deeper into the paranormal in this book than before.But if you want a good romance with entertaining, catchy dialogue, this book is for you. And if you like a few ghosts pitched in for good measure, this is a must read. While very different from her other books, it has the heart, heat and laughter that make Roberts' books great."
3,Good but not Great,"After reading other reviews of this book I have to agree with some who were a bit disappointed in this latest effort. I also am a long time reader (mid 1980's)and have been uncomfortable with the turn her novels have taken lately, Fairie Tales, Ghosts, Reincarnation etc. I thought the beginning of this story held great promise, I would have liked more on the earlier couple. I also felt the ending was very unresolved. Even though I enjoyed the dialogue (Nora's best talent)between Declan and Rena, I felt he was a bit too good to be true. After reading The Villa which I felt to be Nora's worst novel in years, I had high hopes for this one. After all that complaining, I still think it was an enjoyable read, just not up to the high standards she has set for herself."
4,"Beginning is good, middle is good . . . . . .",Ms. Roberts does a great job providing detail of her characters. The idea for the story is good. The read is wonderful up to the end when the book suddently stops. It's like someone said okay you have to stop NOW. I truly liked Declan and Lena and would have liked to see the real end to the story.
2,Disappointing !!,"I found this book a truly disapointment !!When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it .Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !!Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected !!"
3,Good but not her best,"This was a really good book. A little strange as far as topics go, but she pulls it off pretty well. I didn't abandon it which I do often when not kept interested."
3,Surprise Ending Ruined It For Me,"I usually love Nora Robert's books, but this one was disappointing. I just didn't like the how the reincarnation part included a gender change. This book did have good dialogue and some good scenes, so I gave it three stars."
3,shipping concerns: poor packaging,"the special k is fine, athough i am suprised at what i consiider to be high sodium level.my case of this product arrived in an open cardboard box from kellogg's with out being sealed i suppose they are trying to save money, thus the special promotion, another shipment like this, and i will not be ordering any food items from amazon i live in the city and any one or anything could have munched on my special k containers and if their was rain i would not be starting my da with special k."
1,adorn hair spray,"Have ordered this item before without a problem - however - just had the opportunity to use first can of Adorn Unscented Extra Hold - it has a bad ""smell"" - actually made me ill smelling this on my hair. I cannot tolerate odors hence the reason for Unscented - very dissappointed - will not order from this company again."
2,Not Like the Original!,"This product might have the same can design as the old favorite Adorn. But the contents are NOT the same as the Adorn line of products we grew up with. For one thing, this hairspray, despite being the ""unscented,"" has an odd, lingering odor about it. Worse yet, it leaves the hair with a sticky, unnatural feel. I have to use it very sparingly, and even then, my hair ends up looking like something molded out of plastic.Perhaps knowing that there was still a market for the original Adorn hairspray, some overseas manufacturer put out a product in an identically designed can. But they were not able to get the original recipe for the hairspray itself right.I'm afraid the Adorn we grew up with is probably gone forever. This item, whatever its provenance, is definitely no substitute."
1,Extreme dissapointment,"While the subject matter of this book is interesting and, to some degree, useful, the fomatting of this text is so bad as to be barely readable. There are far too many errors. This is more than shoddy work as the issue is easily avoidable. There are many books--free and otherwise--which are far more accessable to readers. This one is a waste of time and money."
3,"Typical HP accessory product, reliable but pricy.","$67 tag seems a little overpriced as comapring with the simplicity of the product, but it just works well even under a harsh environment like our construction jobsite trailer, with our old HP designjet 500."
4,"charming, but chock full of cliches","This is a fun movie to watch, and most people will enjoy it, but don't go into it expecting some cinematic brilliance. It is so full of cliches it is almost unbelieveable, but if you don't mind that, it's a whole lot of fun. I've watched it many times because I am a dancer, and I've known the star of the movie, Amanda Schull since I was five. She's incredibly beautiful (she really does look in real life exactly as she looks in the movie) and she does a great job with the dancing. Ethan Steifel and Sascha Radetsky also are amazing dancers, and the three of them make the movie very enjoyable and fun."
5,One of the best,"I first saw this movie on TV. I was so impressed that I decided to buy the DVD version, which contains three complete dance sequences, as a bonus, in case one wanted to see the whole number without editing. I'm a fan of this production and will never care about its flaws. The dancing is wonderful, intelligent editing enhances the performance and good camera work has made the dance numbers really spectacular. The music ranges from Adam to Michael Jackson. Ask me if I care! I'm not a purist. And what skilled performers! It's probably the best dance movie I have ever seen and I will return to it every time I want to experience that marvelous feeling of watching young people dancing their hearts out. At the end of the final dance sequence, after the courtain has dropped, the dancers embrace each other and that scene brought tears to my eyes. They were so spontaneous and innocent. What a beautiful feeling did they conveyed!"
4,Truly Enjoyable,"I found this movie ""truly enjoyable."" The plot was a bit old and over used but the dancing more than made up for it. The dancing is absolutely amazing. However, the story does not really portray the life of a dancer. It is true that dancers tape their toes and get blisters and sprains but most of a dancers struggle is elsewhere. This movie doesn't show the hard work put into the dancing, the exhaustion at the end of the day, or the way that dancers tend to be harder on themselves than any teacher ever could be. While people should enjoy the movie, because it is more about achieving a dream than any thing else and the dancing is beautiful, they should not be under the impression that the actors are behaving as real dancers would. For example, no dancer would ever talk back to a teacher or walk out in the middle of class. This movie is much better when one pays more attention to the dancing than the acting. The dancing makes it a 4 star movie!"
5,Dancing Queen,"This movie is for you if you ever wanted to dance. It's a teenage movie that is all about hardships at the hardest dance school in the U.S. Teens going through bulimia, fitting in, being in love, finding a place, etc...etc... It shows how much work people put into their dancing, how serious it is to them. Fitting in was a big part of this movie too. The main girl character finds different people who becomes her friends. I thought this movie was excellent!"
5,Delightful Dancing,Wonderful! A dancing classic. It is a MUST HAVE in any dance movie collection. It's got everything not just dancing but also a plot you can get into. Your making a mistake if you don't buy this...
5,An extremley realistic and highly enjoyable film,"I don't know if it's because I've been a ballet dancer since the age of three or if it's because this movie was so amazing. You never hear what goes on behind the scenes, the bloody toes, eating disorders,etc. It's not all the glitz and glam it's cracked up to be. This movie portrays the struggle of a young women trying to make it as a professional ballet dancer and along the way encounters a few romantic, and family struggles. Out of the many things that make this movie so great, knowing that the actors are actually the ones dancing is extremley impressive.I highly recomend viewing and purchasing this movie, if not purchasing, at least add it to your ""wish-list"" !"
4,Center Stage...,"I stumbled upon this film January 3, 2009. I ordered the Soundtrack to the film on January 4, 2009. The film, and the accompanying music engaged me to that level of interest. You really get a good view of what it is to try and become a dancer at a certain level. An entertaining movie, I liked it enough to rate it: 4 stars. See it and be inspired!"
5,a good dance movie,"""Center Stage"" is a movie concerning the lives of several ballet students, who want vaunted positions with ballet companies. The acting is good, and the movie is pretty family safe though I'd keep it away from younger kids because of sexual imagery. However, there are some gorgeous dance scenes, and various concepts from what it means to be a dancer to anorexia/bulimia are dealt with. Good movie!"
4,"""Center Stage"" Review","This was a great movie! It makes you want to get up and dance along with the actors. Zoe Saldana is great as an angst-ridden teenager that, despite her tough exterior, really wants to make it in the supertough ballet world. Great movie all the way around!"
5,Favorite movie,This is a must-see for all dancers! This is one of my all time favorite movies. I especially love the ending dance scenes. If you don't dance then you probobly wouldn't like it because it's mainly based on dance and dancer's lives.
4,Great dancing,"I liked this movie a lot. However, the storyline is pretty unorginal and there's nothing new that you won't have seen in any other dance movie. Still, the dancing is excellent in this movie, you can't deny that the actors are awesome dancers. I really enjoyed their performances. I was relieved to see that they casted actual dancers for this movie, as opposed to actors who go through crash-course dance training to put on mediocre performances (i.e., Save the Last Dance). The dancing makes up for the not-so-creative storyline."
4,good movie,"Good, solid pursue your dreams no matter what they say movie. Have watched many times and I am sure I will watch again if it stays on Amazon Prime."
4,A good fun movie for the average Joe,"I know nothing of dancing and am not really that big on dancing movies. I found fame to be a bit of a bore to be honest. However my girlfriend introduced me to this movie, being a dancer herself. I found that it was a good movie that kept me interest. There is nothing spectacular, but if you are looking to be entertained by something that does not require much thinking and just watch this is a good movie."
5,This is a VERY entertaining movie!,"Center Stage is a very good movie, obviously about ballet dancers. I'm not a ballet dancer, but it still made me want to get up and dance. I watched this movie three times in one week, and I'm not normally the type of person to do that, the movie just never gets old! It's so entertaining and happy. I (and all my friends!)love it!"
4,A great dance movie!,"Center Stage was throughly entertaing! It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again. It's such a fun movie. The dancing scenes were wonderfully choreographed, and exhilarating to watch! The only flaw I could see was that the characters were not incredibly developed, nor did they really need that whole Jody/Cooper involvement. Especially since that part of the story was not really well developed. Other than that, it did a great job depicting life at a competitive dance school. I especially liked the conflict between Maureen, the school's best dancer, and her overbearing mother. Her battle with bulemia was very beliveable. Overall this is a sexy, fun, movie that can be watched over and over again!"
2,FLAT,"I saw this cinematic abomination recently on television, and I have to say that it is one of the most shallow pieces of tripe that I have seen in a LONG time. It seems like they were trying to rekindle the flame ignited by the movie Fame so many years ago, but fail so miserably to capture any real depth in their characters, I am a theatre major, and I enjoy movies in this genre generally, but this one has missed the mark."
1,Dawsons Creek in tutus,A self indulgent cornball bunch of cliches. If you can't see what's coming in this movie within the first ten minutes then you're either blind or never seen a movie before. This is a film that confirms my belief that there's a Hollywood word processing program that can churn out a storyline-by-mumbers script in seconds. And don't get me started on the excruciatingly embarrassing modern ballet at the end....
1,"I hate this movie, and I'm a dancer!!!","When I went to see this movie I thought that I was probably going to enjoy it. Unfortunatly I found that it is one of the worst I have ever seen. Although the film DOES show much of the pain and sacrifice that goes with dancing (espically pointe) the characters are so vapid that you really can't feel anything for them. The story line is somewhat interesting, but is portrayed with such bad acting and direction, that it is lost in the mess that is 'Center Stage'."
3,Graceful Slide,"This movie is unique and different from other movies out there because of the dancing. The beautiful dancing made me want to start taking ballet lessons (too late). The sweet music and graceful moves made the movie much more enjoyable. The storyline and plot isn't that interesting but the dancing makes everything much more interesting. Thanks to the dancing, this movie made it up to 3 stars but without the dancing, it could have slid down to 2 stars. Dancer or non-dancer, this movie will keep amaze you will the beautiful dancing."
2,Bad plot- good inspiration,"a cute plot, but dont go to this movie for any critical analysis of society. It has some neat dances in it, so I suggest it for choreographing inspiration. i guess the ""nice"" guy in the movie is pretty good looking too, but why does she have a thing for that Russian? i dont think he's that attractive..."
3,Packaging makes me nervous,"I have seen this movie over a dozen times so i already know its a fantastic movie; i also own it & when that dvd goes bad, ill just buy another one. However this review is about the dvd i recently purchased from amazon; I bought this movie(again) as a gift for someone and [frankly] im a little nervous about giving it as a gift. I haven't opened it [because it's a gift] but it looks like a copy. It's wrapped in plastic very nicely but i could tell the moment i looked at it that the cover was a copy or it might be used. The print on the front looks kind of blurry and the images on the back look a little photocopied. I bought other dvds from amazon & they never looked like this. As i keep looking at it & comparing it to the one i had for years(which is also special edition),Im starting to think that maybe the manufacturer is just trying to cut costs by scaling back on the printing. The disc inside could be ok but i won't know until she plays it."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this movie partially because of some of the reviews I read here on it. I figured that at the worst, this movie would be like Dirty Dancing - majorly melodramatic, but great dance scenes. Unfortunately, Center Stage doesn't even have that much going for it. The acting is very bad, and while there are a few dance scenes worth watching, too many of them are ridiculously over done. Some of them are just not that great. I don't doubt that the people in this movie CAN dance, they just spend so much time with big, vapid cheesy smiles it's hard for the audience to care."
2,"Dance 10, looks 3","Great dancing, and what is probably a good look at the ""inside story"" of dance training. However - the acting is stiff, dialog cornball, characters stereotyped and plot as predictable as the sunrise."
5,AMAZING!,"this movie glows in the fact that it is very sophisticated,sexy,sentimental,and sharp! center stage deserves 5 stars!"
5,even if you don't like ballet...,i'm not really into ballet but the story line was good...if your looking for inspiration...here it is...she didn't give up even when the told her she would never make it...she even found her love...who just happened to be right in front of her the whole time...
4,"If you like any type of dancing, this is the movie for you.","Like the great dancing in Dirty Dancing and Flashdance,this movie, by the end makes you want to get up and do the dances from the movie. It's not a classic of course, but it's a cute teeny-bop movie with wonderful dancing and a good storyline.Also attention girls: there's a really hot guy... his character name is Charlie"
5,Great Movie,I have seen Center Stage six times and I rent it every time I go to BlockBuster. While watching this movie I laughed and I cried. I think this is the best movie I have ever seen and I am a BIG fan of Amanda Schull. I recomend this movie to anyone that likes romantic dramadies.
5,LIFE DOESN'T HOLD TRYOUTS,"'Centre Stage' is an accurate look at the competative world of ballet. All the dissappointment and excitment, as a group of young talented dances vie for a place in one of two ballet classes.The cast is made up mostly by real life dancers. Amanda Schull is new to the acting world. But I think she does a fantastic job. She is my favorite in this movie. I hope she goes far in movies. There are many others.The other cast members were made up of people with a theatrical backgroud. Which helps when you want to do a movie about ballet.The music is enjoyable.The dancing is spectacular, hot and beautiful. My favorite scenes are the disco, and the final dance performances. There are many others, but these are the two that really stick in my mind. I like the ballet. I find watching it very relaxing and beautiful. But I have never been, nor do I want to be a ballet student. I enjoyed the entire film. It was wonderful."
3,Ballet Fluff,"In simple terms, this movie is ballet fluff. It features characters that can be found in any teen movie, like the girl who has some ability but believes that she can achieve what she wants with hard work, the sassy girl, and the womanizing jerk. Still, it does have 2 redeeming qualities. 1) Some of the dance scenes are imaginative and well danced and choreographed. 2) It has Ethan Steifel, arguably the best dancer out there today and will certainly end up rivaling Baryshnikov in ability. His dancing is nothing short of amazing and hopefully, he'll make people realize that having sons who dream of dancing ballet isn't such a nightmare. Watch the mvie for these 2 reasons, but if you're a purist I'd avoid it because it could make you ill."
5,"my favorite movie, definitely","I really liked Center Stage. I saw it in the theatre the first day it came out. My sister went with me and she wants to be a professional dancer so it was neat for her to see what dance school is really like. There is a lot more dancing than you would think because some of the actors are really professional ballerinas. It was also neat to see the behind the scenes kind of view too. There is the mom who really wants her daughter to be a ballerina more than the daughter does herself. There is the new ballerina who falls for the guy who is already a big star. There is the pressure and competition to its extent. There is the great friendships that can arise from any group of people getting to know eachother doing something they love. I really think everyone will enjoy this movie. It is a true masterpiece not necessarily just a ""chick flick""."
2,Cheap Stereotype of the Real World,"""Center Stage"" is a movie that focuses on a group of friends at the American Ballet Academy, and the drama of their lives, all with a fantastic dance sequence at the end. Most of the characters are played by professional dancers, and you can tell, as the acting leaves something to be desired. Every character, up to the anorexic ballet dancer, was a cheap cliche. I wouldn't rush out to rent this one."
1,don't buy from this previder,"This provider is absolutely horrible!!! I still haven't received this movie, and don't think that I ever will!!! I have e-mailed them twice with no reply- very unprofessional."
3,I've been putting off watching this movie for 12 years,"I guess that says something about my expectations, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by this flick. I really did not know what to expect. But the acting wasn't bad in my opinion. The movie was fairly entertaining. And I really enjoyed the dance pieces at the end. So if you've been putting off watching this movie for over a decade, I would say, give it a try."
3,"What more, I say?!?!?!","Center Stage is about a young woman named Jodi who has lofty goals of becoming a big time ballerina. When she's accepted into a prestigious ballet school, she's well on her way to making it. She's not about to let her clumsy feet get in the way of her high aspirations.The powers that be aren't all too impressed at first. But then she meets danseur extraordinaire Cooper who teaches her about dancing and love and, eventually, heartbreak. Will it be enough to turn this awkward duckling into a brilliant swan?I know that Center Stage may not be an example of cinematic genius. But darn it all, it does have a plot. And the plot is coherent. And the actors are at least somewhat good looking. And there's hot music and great dancing. And really, what more can you ask for from a movie of its kind. What more, I say?!!!?"
3,Entertaining,"I bought this video for my daughter for Christmas. I sat and watched it with her. I found it entertaining but not anything to write home about. Obviously, it appeals to a younger crowd and I think it is a fine movie for teenagers and young adults. But it was entertaining enough to hold my attention. Very well acted for the most part, and the choreography was good."
5,Modernized flashdance,"Although this movie can be referred to as a ""chick-flick"", I sincerely enjoyed it. The ""romance"" is not the strongest part. The eclectic music and unique choreography make this movie comparable to Flashdance or Dirty Dancing. It's amazing what ballet dancers have to go through. I'll never get sick of this movie."
2,No answer manual available?,"I may be missing something, but this workbook does not appear to contain answers (which would be best), and the answer manual/guide appears to be unavailable. A workbook without answers, no matter how good, has limited utility."
2,One Trick Pony - hardly qualifies as rock n' roll,These guys had some talent and good vocals/harmonies. But all these songs sound practically the same with the same style. It's too cutsey and whimpy for my tastes. These 2 albums get old fast.Useful as a nostalgic artifact.
5,Classic Beach Boys,"Some of their best work is on this CD.""Today"" has alot of tracks that would have fit perfectly onto ""Pet Sounds"".""Summer Days(and Summer Nights)"" is a step backward towards cruising, surfing and beach bunnies...but there are still some quality tracks on here!Some of my favorite tracks include...- Good To My Baby- Please Let Me Wonder- I'm So Young- Kiss Me Baby- She Knows me Too Well- Help Me Rhonda- California Girls- Let Him Run Wild- Summer Means New Love- And Your Dreams Come True- The Little Girl I Once KnewTheir best work was still to come with ""Pet Sounds"", but these two albums give you an idea of where they were heading..."
3,Simple Yet Effective,"This re-issue of the Today and Summer Days And Nights is filled with many catchy tunes. Classics like California Girls, When I Grow Up To Be A Man, and Help Me Rhonda will always get any party in a good mood. Some lesser known songs like The Girl From New York City, I'm Bugged At My Ol' Man, and You're So Good To Me also are noteworthy due to some creative vocal arangments.Lyric wise many of these songs are quite basic. Geez, Do You Wanna Dance consists of merely the words in its title and maybe two or three additional sentences. Dance Dance Dance is more along the same lines as well. In general, these songs are about teen love without alot of deep thought. Effective yet but certainly not deep. But loaded with spirit, this compilation certainly is. So all you Beach Boy fanatics might be served to pick this one up."
5,"Growing Up, But Not Old","The Beach Boys Today and Summer Days & Summer Nights show the amazing ability of Brian Wilson. Today is full of more mature songs like ""Please Let Me Wonder"", ""She Knows Me Too Well"", ""I'm So Young"" and ""Good To My Baby"" which have a more adult and intricate sound, but on Summer Days he shows can still produce catchy, fun songs like the unforgettable ""California Girls"", ""You're So Good To Me"", ""Amusement Parks USA"" and their second number one single ""Help Me, Rhonda"". That song also appears on Today, but in a different version that has a false ending and is slower. You can tell he thought there was a hit there as he speeded up the pace and made it move along quicker and his instincts were right. Other standouts include ""Dance, Dance, Dance"", ""Then She Kissed Me"", the soaring ""Let Him Run Wild"" and the amazing, thoughtful, masterfully arranged ""When I Grow Up (To Be A Man)""."
2,Old information. Needs updating badly.,"I used this book in high school for a photography class. When I saw that it had been revised and updated, I bought a copy online to check out for offering at a seminar I would be doing. I couldn't have been more disappointed. To me, revised and updated means improving. This has the same old 70s (60s?) photos, and I am not sure a word in the book has changed. There is just more to it than this - basic photography is no longer only analog. Equipment has changed. This book does not reflect those changes. I subsequently returned my copy."
4,Photo Guide Review,"Purchased this book to get a basic understanding of camera and film. Easy to understand, informative and a great guide for the beginner. Recommend this book for beginners wanting to use film camera or to understand the workings of a camera."
1,Woefully outdated,"This is a great book.............if this were 1977, but it's 2007 and about as useful a book on tips for handling your LPs and 8-track tapes. Although this may a 5th addition printed in 2001, the book feels more like 1971. Obviously, the digital revolution has by now fully supplanted film to the extent you can hardly find a film camera to buy save eBay. As good of an intro this may have been decades ago, it today has zero value for any new photographer."
5,Excellent for Adults New to Still Photography,"I teach still photography to adults who have no previous experience in the field. I have found this book to be an excellent resource for my course. It stays away from the point and shoot cameras and concentrates on the entry level manual/automatics, which I feel is very positive. I give it to my students and require that they read it before the first class session meets, then use its photos alongside adjustable cameras to teach the basics: aperature, shutter speed, film speed, depth of field, stopping motion, etc."
5,An excellent 35mm beginner's book,"This book is an excellent resource for anyone wanting to know more about taking pictures with their 35mm camera. I disagree with the other reviewer -- this book takes you way past the owner's manual and gives clear, concise, step by step instructions. It gives great pointers on lighting, composition, focusing -- every facet of shooting a picture is covered and wonderfully illustrated.I recommend this book!"
1,Not a good start,"Although the book was revised and updated in 1997, the pictures and cameras used in the book are 1970's style. They have added just a couple of updates with new camera technology. You'd be better off just sticking with your camera's manual. For example, 10% of book talks about loading and unloading film. Most beginners even know how to do that!"
2,"""Basic"" is an understatement...","If you know nothing about 35mm photography; if you have never held a 35mm SLR in your hands; if you need the low down on ""how to"" in the simplest form, then this may be the book for you. Otherwise, skip it--""basic"" is an understatement. I gave my copy to a needier friend. Nat'l Geographic's ""how-to"" and the Kodak guide to 35mm photography (although both on the heavy side) are better choices and are both packed full of more advanced information (and exciting color photos)for down the road."
4,Need I say more!!,"Ok , this book is named after what it exactly is, true seduction, on both CJ and Wes 's part! Wes was there to do a job, by any means necessary, and a seduction seemed perfect. CJ on the other hand, had other things on her mind as well. CJ herself has had many a men. Trying to to make a change in her life, but one look and she just had to have Wes. Even though it only started out just a seduction for both Wes and CJ, but love crept in somewhere and surpriased the both of them. A really good read!"
5,You have heard anything yet.,"This CD is definitely for those that crave the little bit different in life. The music is creative and allows you to be swept in by its rich and funky beats. Although at first you might think, "" What is this and how did it get on my radio?"" you will find that it grabs you and gets under your skin with violent passion. If you crave the different things in life this is the CD for you."
4,Almay Clear Complexion Powder,"Almay Clear Complexion Powder Makeup, Neutral 220, .3 oz (8.4 g) (Pack of 2)Great coverage! It is nice having it delivered to our home and not having to go to town and buy it."
1,"Book with an intriguing title, thats it.",I purchased this book because of its eye catching title but was disappointed after reading a few pages. I was also under the impression that the writer will describe in detail the famous GT road and his experiences while traveling on it. Instead there is more about famous cities of the sub continent and that too written weakly. There are numerous other books written very well. Don't get confused with the title.
1,grand trunk trash,"If one prefers good travel writing, skip this book.One of the most boring travelogues I have ever had the misfortune to read. Mr. Bach starts with good intentions, but then loses the whole plot. Is travel writng only about ones travelling or should it carry a bit of history of the place, of one's thoughts. Mr Bach could do well to read Paul Theroux, Alexander Frater and all before he writes another book. Its good to be a India lover, but thats all that there is to Mr Bach."
5,Wonderful!,"Let's say that you get what you pay for! I removed the water restricted flow ring with a paper clip and have loved my showers with this new shower head!This is super powerful, but can also be put on a less intense setting. Buy this! You will not be disappointed!"
2,Very wide and messy spray,I will say that this is a very heavy and nicely made shower head. Out of all the shower heads I haver ever seen this one feels worth its weight however as a shower head it is disappointing.I am replacing my shower head because the o-ring that allows the head to swivel is leaking and the head is starting to shoot in some crazy directions - it needs a good cleaning. So I was seeking a replacement. I cam across this one and it got goo reviews but in order to get some decent velocity the spray pattern is way too wide. There is no way to narrow it down and I estimated while showering that at 3 feet from the shower head you have a 4 foot diameter cone of water. My shower was wet in places it shouldn't and never has been. For this reason I am looking for something different and will be returning. If you shower is huge and the head is far away from you it might work - most are not.
3,Better Showers?,"I expected ALOT more flow from the 8 jet than the 6 jet. I also wanted a ""Fatter"" water flow with the water saver removed as Speakman customer service suggested. It looks good and operates well. Nice heavy constuction."
2,Speakman S-2251 Anystream Icon 8-Jet Showerhead in Polished Chrome,"Plain and simple-- a disappointing shower head. This was purchased as any upgrade to the 6 jet shower head. It gives a wider spray pattern but lacks the pressure stream that you would expect from such an expensive shower head. When the water is turned off, it starts leaking approximately 90 seconds later and the leakage lasts for about 45 seconds or so. Very annoying!! I am reluctant to remove any of the inside parts as mentioned by other reviewers for fear of completely ruining it. It does have a very elegant look to it but I don't think it is worth spending $110 on it!"
4,nice showerhead,"This is a really nice shower head and the quality can be felt in the weight. That being said, it's still not as good as the pre '94 model (dang government)."
5,"My favorite shower head, then and now!","When it was time to replace the shower head in our master bath I remembered having used Speakman heads in the men's locker at our country club years earlier, as well as in several top hotels, so I decided to try to find one on Amazon.com. Of course here they were, and we narrowed our selection down to this one and a less expensive model. My wife has a full head of VERY thick hair (lucky her), and wanted a shower head that would rinse her hair faster than our old one. I told her about Speakman shower heads and talked her into trying this one. She absolutely LOVES it, as do I. As did others, I removed the little rubber ring from inside the head to insure a stronger water flow and it works great! Took a few attempts to get the little ring out, but out it came and we couldn't be happier. We'll never use any other brand again!"
4,Thoroughly unbiased overall picture - a good place to start,Very good account of where we've been and where we are going. I would have liked the author to have given his ideas on artificial intelligence. The emphasis throughout the book is on 'adaptive technology' which is an idea akin to basic survival instinct. I enjoyed the book very much.
5,Great overview how object technology fits modern soft. devel,I used this book before I knew what object technology was all about. It gave me an incentive to re-tool my skills. I am now using it as a marketing tool to my management to let them know how object technology can solve some of our most basic software dilemnas.
4,Dr. Taylor's book is an excellent introduction to basic OO.,"Dr. Taylor's book is an excellent introduction to the basic concepts of object technology. Because the book is written as an executive summary, it's a quick read for the IS-aware reader who wants a friendly introduction to object technology concepts and lingo. I give the book to clients at the start of our OO engagements to increase their knowledge of/comfort with the object concepts we use. Just about right for one coast-to-coast airline flight ..."
4,This is really a book for developers... (IMHO),"This book is definitely worth the read, and it's a great reference when trying to communicate ideas to others. However, I feel the title is misleading, as it's a much better reference for developers new to Object Technology than most managers."
1,"The usual drivel - nothing new, nothing worthwhile","Yawn. Yet another apologetic for OO in the large enterprise without any existence proofs. The author demonstrates a consistent lack of connection to enterprise computing and the book is full of ""someday"" and ""in the future"" references to OO in the large. Give this book to your manager and you are sure to get taken down an IT rathole. BTW, Dr. Taylor, I've worked on large airline computer reservations systems of the type you cite in the book, and there is *nothing* OO about them. Somewhere at the bottom of the OO fantasy lies a lot of government grant money, I'm convinced of it."
5,"The title says it all, but programmers will benefit from this book also","I gave a [highlighted] copy of this book to my boss. This was after reading it thoroughly several times. It is an excellent introduction to OO analysis and design issues.This won't replace Booch, Rumbaugh, UML and GoF Design Patterns, but it will get you started on the road to better software development. This is a primer, a bird's-eye-view. It can serve as a common vocabulary and basis of communication between non-technical and technical ppl.The best thing about this book is the strong integration of text, annotations and high-quality graphics. The ideas jump out of the page into your head. This book could be used as an introductory CS text in senior high school or freshman college."
4,A good overview.,"I read this book, along with Entsminger's Tao of Objects, when I needed to gain a good ""technical lay person's"" understanding of object-oriented technology. Though I've since done some rudimentary programming to hammer home the key concepts, I recommend both books."
2,Broke on first use,"The day it arrived I took it out to the backyard to try it out. After forty or so shots the shot pouch tore in half. But for the twenty minutes of use before it broke, it was pretty effective."
1,I guess you get what you pay for..,This was a piece of junk. But can't complain too much it was super cheap. I'd go with something else..
2,"Great when it works, but rubber band breaks quickly","I bought this slingshot and used it a couple dozen times before the rubber band broke. Before breaking I got relatively accurate shots from about 50-60 feet. I returned it to the store I bought it from (Canadian Tire) and got a replacement of the same type. After about 6 shots the band broke on the replacement slingshot. I'm returning this piece of cheap garbage, getting my money back, and making my own."
1,Pouch is crap,"The first day my son was using this, the pouch tore right where the tubing was connected. The pouch is very flimsy leather with a felt type feeling. i would not recommend this to anyone unless they want to use it for display only."
4,Worth a watch!,"I had the good fortune to have been at the premier in Tampa, December 16th. My wife, daughter and I met and had cordial conversation with Mr. J.Jenkins and his son Dallas. Stephen Baldwin was there also, all to promote the film in a benefit for the Tampa Crisis Center. No this isn't ""Over the River and Through the Woods...."" fare, but is well worth watching, and although some of the pauses and reflection periods during the film seem pervasive, the pace mirrors the empty frustrating and frequently depressing day to day experiences those in crisis must feel. I will remember that evening for a long time. Although placed at Christmas time, the events portrayed are 24/365. Thank you Jerry and Dallas Jenkins for making this film."
2,Thumbs down,"i really like Stephen Baldwin, but did not like this movie at all. Don't bother....very slow...not too well-written."
2,The story was left completely hanging,The story lacked any real build up or ending. It just started in the middle of the story and stopped in the middle of the story.
1,Have not receive it!,I have not received this as yet even though I order it November and had to reorder in December. I am still waiting.
3,Great Movie,"I don't know why some of you have made remarks about the moving being ""short"" and ending in 25 minutes. The movie is 1 hour 47 minutes long I believe. Steven Baldwin does make a remark in a brief interview on the dvd that he had originally done this as a 25 minute stage vignette. But... these people are not commenting on the FULL LENGTH movie Midnight Clear. This is a great movie, and while I had a hard time getting through the first part of the film as it seemed bleak and depressing, in the end, it was WELL WORTH IT. Random acts of kindness and simple kindness to others can impact people's lives in a way we may never imagine or ever find out. This is REAL LIFE. It is inspirational. For you others who shy away from depressing films....stick with it."
5,Midnight Clear,"Great book and movie. This tells the story of several people searching for hope in hopeless situations, or so they think. It is wrapped around Christmas which makes it even better. Great transaction with seller."
2,Don't buy this camera,Don't buy this camera (Panasonic LZ2) if you ever intend to take pictures outdoors. The LCD screen is completely wiped out by outdoor sun on an average day. I rated this camera 2 stars only to acknowledge that there may be folks who might use the camera 100 percent indoors.
4,Lumix DMC-LZ2 5MP,A very good compact camera. Excellent to take around and fits perfectly in pocekts.
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I got this camera as a Christmas gift, and it worked okay for about 5 months. Now it won't turn on or anything! I have replaced the batteries, tried to get help from Panasonic, it is still under warranty, but just for them to look at it will cost another $100... The store we got it from doesn't even sell it anymore, so maybe whatever my camera has wrong with it is common?I will never buy Panasonic anything again!"
2,disappearing icons,"Bought the camera beginning of December. Used it 5 days and almost all the indentifying print marks on the camera (camera name, button icons (the ones that identify which button do what) all rubbed off!! I now have a camera with almost no printing on it at all. I have never seen that before. The camera didn't get wet, it was kept in a soft camera bag. Also, everyone's commments that you can't see anything on the LCD in bright sun or in dark rooms is true. I missed some terrific shots of whales in the Pacific because of not being able to see anything on the screen and also couldn't see anything on the LCD in a restaurant/club. When it works, it's great--image stabilization is worth the price--but I was disappointed not being able to see more on the LCD, and I couldn't believe the ink wore off the camera. I returned it--this is poor quality manufacturing."
2,Great Camera but...,"Got this camera for my wife - a digital novice - during Christmas 2005. Camera is easy to use and takes good pictures. Easily interfaces with PC through USB. However, I also (as did another reviewer) started having problems after about 11 months. Camera would not take pictures as the CCD went bad. Luckily I had an extended service contract and it was repaired. Unfortunately, it just quit working again (April 2007) and the service contract company says they ""...won't bother fixing it again..."" and is refunding my purchase price. Gracious but a hassle doing without a camera for a second time. Good camera but if you buy one make sure you get the service contract."
2,Nice camera that also broke in less than a year,"Great camera for the price. But I guess you get what you pay for, bad warranty............"
4,Good camera for beginner,This is surely good camera for beginner like me with budget constraint. It is value for money. I'm quite happy with the picture quality taken in the night. The date taken is shown on the picture. 6 times zoom is usefull. 5.1 megapixel is more than enough for snaping simple picture.
2,I loved this camera,"...but it stopped working after a year. The only thing the lens sees now is black, although the camera still turns on and I can look at pictures I took before the problem started. Nonetheless, I loved this camera, and I think it was worth it, even though it only worked a year. Now I've learned my lesson and will buy a longer warranty or exchange for m new camera."
1,worked ok until.......,"Purchased this camera for the 6x zoom. Worked well for about a year. It is pretty much impossible to see anything in the LCD outdoors in any kind of daylight. You often have to just point and guess. When it took pictures the quality was very good. After about a year the LCD screen when black. All the menu items would show, even the flash would go, but the pictures were just black. Replacing batteries would sometimes work for a day. Enjoyed the 6x zoom and the picture quality, but really can't recommend that camera. Look for something more reliable."
3,A little high in price for the quality,"I thought the towel was nice and big, but I thought for the price it could of Ben softer and fluffier."
2,stopping with this series here,"this series started off so good. and I've loved other novels of benford's. But it was like he almost completely lost it with this one. there's a few details that come in to play later that indicate it wasn't completely a stream-of-consciousness piece. but i had to skim dozens of pages of endlessly repeated musings. dreadful. most dreadful of all, I suppose, because there is a really cool story somewhere at the heart of this. Some really excellent exploration of the very different-ness of aliens. Ah, some alien aliens! I couldn't have stuck through to the end without that. but I'm going to stop with this series here. reviews for the next book are insufficiently encouraging, and I fear if i continue the last books will make me hate the entire series and the author. benford's capable of great great books. So I'll stop now and wait and see."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Robot centipedes aren't good.Or, this book follows on from Great Sky River, with Killeen in charge of his particular group of chess piece clan human strugglers. Mechs, mechanical big insects, other people, pretty much it seems everything is out to get them, in general.Not much different in quality between this and the preceding novel, like the other one, you will probably like this book, too."
4,jacket summary,"from the back cover of the November 1989 Bantam Spectra paperback editioncover art by Paul SwendsenSet against the magnificent, furious backdrop of the Galactic Center, here is a drama as compelling as the towering Great Sky River. A small human band flees from a threat it cannot hope to match - enormously superior artificial minds embodied in great insect-like machines. This last remnant of humanity is led by Killeen, a man elevated to command in desperate times by his luck and daring. He manages to reach a new planet where he encounters vast wonders - a planet-coring cosmic string, an organic life-form the size of an entire world, another group of humans led by a strange messianic ruler - and even greater dangers from the most awesome beings they have yet to face.Their battle for survival reaches overwhelming dimensions. But they will gain an unexpected ally. And they will contribute shockingly to the new order of life that is developing around them."
5,Intrigue and mistaken identities,Two friends Susan (Crystal Bernard) and Nicole (Traci Lords) exchange identities so that Susan's insurance can cover an operation for Nicole. Looks like a small medical mistake causes Nicole's death. Or was there more too it? Now Susan officially dead and still in the persona of Nicole can not go to the authorities and enlists the help of Ron Holden (Judge Reinhold) to help sort things out. It dose not take long for us to figure it out and spend the rest of the time kibitzing. Of course Susan never listens to us.This film was made for TV and it shows in the formula story and lo budget setting. However veteran actor Judge Reinhold does his best.
3,As good as nothing,"As good as dead had the makings for a bad B movie right from the beginning. I mean, come on. Crystal Bernard with a lead role? But, actually she did a decent job. I wish I could say the same for the rest of the actors though. I always thought Judge Reinhold was a good actor. Well, he was pitiful in this film. It was almost laughable. Also, some of the dialogue spewing from these people's lips was incredibly cheesy. And the ending was pretty pitiful also. But, this movie did do well in certain areas like suspense. It kept me interested throughout the whole movie, which is always a plus. The directing wasn't bad either. The premise was OK. The movie just needed a little bit more talent in it. Overall, As good as dead is a marginal movie that makes the most out of itself with the poor acting. 3 Stars"
4,I read this book three times!,"Ms. King is a gifted story teller. She entertained me, and that's what good writing is all about. The story, with all its characters and sub-plots, is well-written. It moves and keeps the reader turning pages. The characters are well-developed and one begins to ""know"" them as the story develops. Readers who enjoy a good story will not be disappointed by this book."
5,One's attention is captured until the book ends!,I identified very well with this book since I grew up in north Georgia.The characters and places elicited a warm nostalgic feeling.The author always has several attention grabing episodes going at the same time and one keeps reading to find out what will happen.It is well written and demonstrates the author's vast knowledge of the mores and customs of early 1900's in the southern U.S.
5,Best sleepwear in any climate,"Hanes sleep capris are the most comfortable yu can wear. Sizes run true. also, I live in a climate that can change in one day, from hot to cold and back again. These capris seem to work at all times. I plan on ordring more very shortly. The material is soft and length is perfect. I would reccomend these capris for evryone out there."
5,the definitive viking metal album!,"i didn't know Windir, only they were a Black/Viking metal band from Norway and bla bla bla. Suddenly this album found his way to my hands, and i listened to it. I'm still amazed how good can this album be.From start to end, a blend of harsh riffing, norwegian folky melodies, male choirs, catchy melodies... this album has it all. A must have (i only registered Amazon to review this, imagine how impacted I am).Highlights: Martyrium,Blodssvik,Fagning."
5,A clear message,"This book contains a clear definition and examples how karma plays out in your life. What strikes me is how karma is expressed in several different religions. Some see it as the ""Golden Rule"" others hear Jesus say Do unto others..... or Jesus expresses it as ""You reap what you sow"". However you view it this simple, easy to read book can be a catalyst and instruction manual how to start changing your life.......if you see the need or desire change."
1,Disappointed,The contents of this book are over simplified and shallow. It is also difficult to follow the verse outline.
1,RULES,I found this book to be a complete waste of my money. I found it to have useless information for me to use.
1,"Missed shipping date, item arrived several weeks late and sent to wrong address!","Horrible, horrible service. Not only did this company miss it's shipping date by several weeks, but it also sent the item to the wrong address (the address I provided to them is not the address they shipped to which caused further delay - The receipt provided to me had the correct mailing address which was supposedly a confirmation of where they would be mailing it so the error definately came from their side, how on earth they screwed it up is beyond me)."
4,Not a bad little jacket,"I just got this jacket, so this review is on first impressions. It's a nice Jacket. I like the colour and the accents make it look cool and technical, which while not really important, does have a place in items of this type. I've also found it to be waterproof, and reasonable warm. I have yet to try it out while being terrible active, but so far it seems to be doing the job it was bought for. The only thing I think could make it better is if it was a bit longer in the body, but that is a small quibble."
3,Cool,This game is fun. It's addicting. You have to do challenges or dares to get to the next level. You can become a pro skater! You have to know how to read. It is good for 7 and 8 year olds.
1,Inaccurate Platform,"I ordered this item for a Christmas gift. It arrived shortly before December 25th. Unfortunately, the website indicated that this game could be played on GameCube. When I got the game, it clearly stated that it would play only on GameBoy Advance. This item is inaccurately reflected on the Amazon website. I ended up returning the game and purchasing it somewhere else."
1,good book ruined,"There are no illustrations, and no links from the table of contents. Project Gutenberg has a beautiful edition for the Kindle, with illustrations, links, beautifully formatted, for free."
1,sailing- choada,"Some might find a book about 3 years at sea interesting like famous skot heffner. But I think waking up,Using the restroom and sleeping on a boat for 3 years less than entertaining. Chalky white says what he wants when he wants!"
1,Where are the pictures?,"I'm so disappointed, and here it is two days before Christmas! I ordered the paperback version for my Grandson, but the book has no illustrations -- no maps, no lines and sail plans of the Spray. Yet the narrative includes references to the non-existent illustrations.Why was that not made clear in the description on Amazon?"
5,Not your typical sailing story,"Slocum has managed to tell his tale in an upbeat manner with a keen wit. He never proclaims himself to be great; however, he takes great joy in those who doubt him. There are so many great scenes in this book. One lady sitting next to me on a flight said that I appeared totally engrossed in this work and she was right."
5,A Classic,"This should be required reading for all Americans. An incredible tale of Yankee ingenuity, hard work and adventure like none other I've ever read. This was a normal guy without significant education or experience, written before modern education advances (sarcasm intended) who commands a clarity of thought and expression that rivals most people with advanced education today. Even if a sailing tale is of no interest to you, read this solely to learn to write!"
5,Fantastic adventure!,"Joshua Slocum was the first person to sail around the world. In this book he tells about his voyage. Joshua Slocums story is very entertaining to read. He writes about the practical and technical challenges of long distance sailing in the 19th century and about his encounters with the peoples and tribes on his route. The writing style is short and factual, but that almost makes the impression even stronger given that more often than not Joshua Slocum had to face death and only escaped with the narrowest of margins. They don't make'em like that any more... I highly recommend this book. it's a great read!"
1,no illustrations,"this edition has no illustrations, a cheap edition, very frustrating because the book is very good. I was forced to buy another edition with the illustrations, but have had problems with the shipping from the vendor, the book has not arrived, so I will have to buy a third edition !! Very frustrating. The first time this has happened to me at Amazon."
5,"Follow the Spray, she'll lead you whe you need to go....","I grew up listening to Sailing Alone Around the Worldby Joshua Slocum. His adventures in a distant era on the Sprayseemed magical to me. All the more fantastic because they weretrue. As I continue to plan my walk over the length ofEurope, from Norway to the Medditerannean this story hasoften been remembered. I reccomend it for all who can dream.good journey,tor"
4,Not bad as a debut!,Jefferson Parker must be a fan of Raymond Chandler and especially Ross MacDonald as their influences are prevalent throughout this book.I found that Parker's book was quite readable although maybe a little long-winded. I prefer the shorter books like MacDonald used to write.I think the author planned on this being the start of a series featuring his hero but it doesn't seem to have taken place as yet.Worth a read if you like the gumshoe detective-type books (which I do).
3,The Author is just learning to flex his Writing Muscles,"Laguna Heat was a decent book, but I have found later works by the author to be better written as well as better organized, and more suspenseful. It definitely worth reading if you like T. Jefferson Parker... I am merely stating that he has gotten better with practice :-)"
5,A brilliant early novel from this outstanding author,"I read ""Laguna Heat"" when it was released 25 years ago in hardback. I've been a huge fan of TJP ever since. Parker is definitely a master at his craft!"
2,Piaf,"Good. But not amazing. Piaf songs by an other singer called Raquel Bitton. Its not a documental. It is an honoring to the singer across the interpretation of her most notable songs. The intention is good, but it does not impress."
3,Watch Out!,"I'll preface this review by stating that I was careless and ordered this without knowing what it was.I made the mistake of ordering one of Ms. Bitton's CD's a few years ago. I couldn't stand it, and ended up giving it away. As a 40-year Piaf fan, I found her interpretation of Piaf the most unpleasant I'd come across. This is yet more Ms. Bitton, and I wouldn't have ordered it had I spent the time to read the contents.My view is only my own, and others appear to like Ms. Bitton's work very much. After all, it is what makes us all different. If one likes Ms. Bitton's singing, one will like the DVD.I would only recommend that, before purchasing this DVD, one should go to one of Ms. Bitton's CD interpretations of Piaf, and listen to the samples."
3,Piaf Performed by Raquel Bitton,Raquel Bitton singing Piaf's songs and narrating the life of Piaf in between songs. Interview/dinner with people who knew and/or worked with Piaf made for an interesting CD.
5,Edith Piaf,"I would like to thank Amazon for their wonderful service, I have never been let down. This film, although in subtitles is a wonderful story of Piaf's life with wonderful music throughout. I would highley recomend this film to anyone intrested in Piaf, like my self .I never knew the full extent of heartach she endured in her life, though I guessed as much through the pain in some of her songs."
4,Great reference tool!,"A great reference tool that's much more informative and instructional than the documentation in Apple's DVDSP manual. When I want to learn how to do something in DVDSP 2.0 this book is the first reference tool I pick up, and I've rarely had to look elsewhere. Apple ought to have Erica write their tech manual on version 3.0!Bob StearnsNext Chapter Graphics"
2,Misleading QTY and Over-Priced,"The Title of this item is grossly misleading. It implies that you are getting 288 ROLLS, when in fact you are only getting 24 rolls = 288 individual mints.The Title: ""Total: 288 ct (24 X 12 ct)""I would never have thought ""ct"" meant individual mints.Also, the price of $20 is very high for 24 rolls.You can buy this at Sams Club for $11.46.I do give Amazon Customer Service high marks. In response to my complaint about the misleading quantity, they gave me a $5.00 coupon to be applied to my next order.In general, I have found Amazon products and service to be excellent.This has been my only complaint."
1,Not what I expected,"My husband loves the National Treasure movies, so I thought this would be a great gift idea for him. When watched the video, though, we both ended up laughing at its cheesy direction and its far-reaching theories. We turned it off mid-way through and donated it."
2,"feces, puke and sex","I will always tip my hat to independent animators. However, this film falls short in my opinion. Yes it will be memorable, but not because it was good. Humor can be found in the disgusting and revolting, but the entire film is composed of feces, puke and sex. To say the least, it was too much for me to appreciate. What little there was that felt charming and sweet was overpowered by foulness. But to be honest, I have seen far worse (unfortunately)"
1,bizarre,"This is one one the strangest movies I've ever seen. The narrator/main character is obsessed with defecation, urination, and copulation related to dogs and humans and graphically depicts them over and over throughout the movie. The animated characters that reside in the narrator's imagination are sometimes human, sometimes canine, and sometimes a part human-part dog creature which all engage in multiple failed copulation attempts, all graphically depicted. The author's fascination with the dog's failed attempts at copulation is only surpassed by his interest in the many places and ways in which the dog empties her bowels, also animated with great attention to detail. He throws in some very gloomy, self-obsessed, narcissistic comments about life in between his descriptions and depictions of the bodily functions of his beloved pet. There is not one likable character in the whole thing, including perpetually barking, ill-mannered dog. Very strange movie from start to finish."
2,Wallows in the bodily functions and urges that are inherent to dog-ness,"This movie is often praised for following the book in not avoiding the bodily functions and urges that are inherent to dog-ness. I'd say the movie doesn't just ""not avoid"" them, it wallows in them - to the detriment of the more meaningful and insightful story."
1,Artful but Overrated,"After reading Roger Ebert's glowing review several months ago I thought I would enjoy this movie. It did not meet expectations stylistically or thematically. Too many ruminations on the dogs urinary and bowel habits. Don't need to see a dog's anus drawn on the screen, nor hear discussions about her ""red vulva."" Wished the movie would have captured some of the other joys the narrator felt through this relationship, as opposed to the narrator's desire to breed the dog for some reason. Animation style disappointed as well. Starts off promising but then fades, and can be surprisingly dark. (The narrator matter-of-factly discusses drowning Tulip's puppies). I thought it would be less about the breeding of the dog and more about the owner and dog growing old together, as well as vignettes about differences between dogs and their owners, benefits of having a dog, etc. Gotta go against the critics on this one - thumbs down."
1,Breaks within the first few months. CS is terrible.,"We bought this stupid gate and within a couple of months one of the plastic clips broke. Called CS and could only get VM. A week later, I got a call back from a guy with a seriously bad attitude and he went by manufacture date(which of course was more than a year old) and charged me for replacement clips. At least they forced 4 clips(min order) on me so when they keep breaking, I have spares. The gate also has an idiotic larger space at the end compared to the middle spaces. So our smallest dog can slip right through the end. So we have to stuff that with something to keep her from getting through that larger gap. Stupid engineering. Terrible CS with bad attitude, and sticking it to you when their inferior designed plastic clips break. Weak sauce."
2,Not impressed,i ordered this product and Amazon shipped it to me promptly. When I opened the package the product had a bad weld so one of the bars was loose. Amazon promptly sent a new one and returned the defective one with no hesitation. I just received the replacement one today. I opened the box to discover the screws to hang the hinges are not in the box. I am going to keep the gate. I have screws I can use but I am concerned about the shoddy workmanship and missing pieces. What can we expect from China though!
1,Picture not accurate of contents,"Buyer be aware. The description and picture of contents in the box are not accurate. The picture shown includes 2 extensions that are not part of this product. The description states it reaches 60"", which it does not unless you buy those two extension.I paid $69.99 plus $10.00 shipping from Revival Animal Health to learn this. I returned and was charged a 20% restocking fee and had to pay $20.00 shipping to return direct to manufacture (Carlson Pet Products). Rip off. Revival told me that I should have bought direct from them instead of using Amazon... then they could help me out more.I should have just bought the extensions from them, but I was so mad at being treated so poorly - that I paid to return and be penalized.This is the last time I will purchase anything from an Amazon Seller. Might as well deal with EBay. Only Amazon direct from here."
4,Carlson Maxi Pet Gate,"Item was the perfect gate for a wide space AFTER I ordered the inserts from Target; however, because we are using this in a very humid environment, the metal portions began to rust very quickly. Would I purchase it again? Yes, there are no other choices out there for EXTRA-WIDE spaces."
3,Does its job,"This is a budget gate that does its job. It is basiccally a bunch of metal tubing spot welded together and painted. So if you are looking for a budget gate and looks are not that important this would be a good choice. If you are lookings for a gate to compliment your trim/woodwork, you willl probably want to spend more money and get something that is a little higher quality. It was easy to assemble and is keeping the kids out of the area that we have blocked off. I For what I am using it for I would buy this again."
5,Mothers Wax 3 part system,"I own a classic car and could not find this wax anywhere in the town I liver in. I had seen a car with the 3 part system done on it and it was just beautiful. When I got the wax I immediately started in on my car. My big black thunderbird now looks like showroom quality. I highly recommend this 3 part wax series. The prewax took so much stuff off my car, I couldn't believe there was that much junk on the car. It takes some time to do all of the series but it is worth it!!!!!!"
5,Sweet Lover Hangover,"This is a very dark album.The chared guitar on the cover from when the studio burned down half way through the recording only begins to describe the emoition in this album. The Album is a piece of art leaving no ""single"" aside. It's facinating after listening to the album how one can tell the exact moment the studio burned down as the mood goes from blues to agro. This is a great album for a dark day. Reminisent of Bauhaus."
4,"Yep, it's a grower.","I love Love and Rockets, but I sometimes don't 'get' what their albums are about until long after I've bought them.I got 'Express' and thought, ""It's not like Tones on Tail."" But then after a while I loved it.I got 'Earth Sun Moon' and thought, ""It's kind of hippy."" But then I couldn't stop playing it.Well, I got ""Sweet F. A."", and thought, ""It's really gritty and druggy."" I put it away for several years. Only recently have I pulled it out again and given it several close listenings, and some things have come out of it.The songs are, by turns, beautiful, hypnotic, and groovy.It's made with care and skill, both in production and musicianship.There's a sense of humour, world-weariness, and good old-fashioned rock and roll decadence.In short, this is a very different Love and Rockets album. It grows on you. It might be better than Earth Sun Moon. Maybe even better than Express. It's been in my stereo for days, and I don't know when it's coming out. That's good."
5,This is the Best Love and Rockets Album!,"I am a huge fan of Love and Rockets, and I think this is their best album yet. Although some of the songs have a deeper mood to them, then some of their previous albums, Sweet F.A. is one you can NEVER get sick of. My personal favourite tracks are Sweet Lover Hangover, Fever, and Use Me. Honestly, most people I know who have heard this album, or own it, feel the same way I do about it. I've had it FOREVER! and I still listen to it constantly always loving it."
4,'Sweet F.A.:' A New Tale to Tell,"This album, born in the wake of a disastrous house fire which destroyed most of their equipment, crackled with a kind of raw sonic energy uncommon in this age of over overproduced and overhyped music. True, this album is no 'Express' (by far their masterpiece), but it stands on its own. There is some beautifully vicious material on this album, and I mean that as a compliment. If you can, find ""The Glittering Darkness"" EP (long out of print, released just before Sweet FA) -- now there is a true testament to the neo-psychadelic roots of the boys from Bauhaus."
4,Best of the bunch,"Love and Rockets has always left a bad taste in my mouth. I've never really thought they did justice to the talent they seemed to have come from. But this album, to my complete suprise, was just wonderful. Much like what they were trying to do with Tones On Tail, this album shows that they know what's going on in the studio and their best written songs (ever) are sonically crafted to perfection. The album is dark and moody, sometimes sweet and sappy, and occasionally they throw a bit of a Beatles rip-off at you which works suprisingly well. I've recommended this CD to several people, whether they're L&R fans or not."
3,I really didn't like it all that much.,"Love and Rookets will always be my favorite band, but I didn't like too many songs on this album. I was expecting more electronic like ""Hot Trip"", but it was more rock orientated (and not in a good way like thier older work). There are a few good tracks, but overall I'd say don't waste your money unless you're a big fan intending on owning all thier albums."
2,it's a shame,"""Sweet Lover Hangover"" was a fabulous single, so I was excited for this album to come out. What a letdown. They sound bored on these songs, like they're just going through the motions of their earlier work without coming close to replicating any of it. L&R is my all-time favorite group, so I truly tried to like this album, but it didn't happen.OK, there is one other good song: ""Natacha"" is a warm, dreamy swoon. But unless you're a diehard ""completist,"" as they say, don't bother with this."
4,"Overlooked, but solid release","For those that are only familiar with the first four L&R albums, check this one out. It doesn't have the electronic experimentation that was on Hot Trip to Heaven. A few of the songs sound as if they could have been on the fourth record. The title track, ""Use Me"", ""Sweet Lover Hangover"" and ""Here Come the Comedown"" are the highlights. Worth a look."
2,Could be better,I own a small commercial pest control business and we like to use a small hand held sprayer for apartments. This unit is a great idea..but not very reliable or durable. Also for evey 12 we purchase..we avarage two defects. B&G makes the best sprayers..but this one doesn't live up to their reputation...too bad.
4,"Good towels, great price","I give these good marks on texture, absorbency and appearance. Great price."
4,When I put these towels on wet things they are not wet anymore,"God bless the indigenous peoples of... wherever for their amazing textile worksmanship.Also, they are soft and my cats like to sleep on them :("
5,Best ever!,These towels are great. They wash well and absorb wonderfully. Nice and soft as well as very thick.
3,Didn't like the color (pearl grey)...,"I didn't like the pearl grey set in person (it was lackluster), so I returned them...."
5,"Best towels I've ever bought. Top quality, supersoft, durable.","These towels are the best I've ever bought from Amazon. I regularly watch their sales for towel sets at $19.99 or less but usually receive ones that look and feel like economy towels. These Eloquence towels are the first I've bought that have that expensive, high quality feel to them. They are thick, soft and wash well. My husband, who demands high absorbancy from towels, also approves. I wish I could buy more but I plan to move this year and don't know the color scheme of the new house. These towel sets have a one per customer limit on them. In order to get more than one set, I just made multiple purchases and would add a $5 DVD movie to the cart to qualify for the free S&H."
3,Decent Towels,These are decent towels for the price. Soft and they don't leave the fuzzy fur all over you.
1,Dont buy this item,I purchased this Broan Hood and returned it twice. Its great when its cold but when you turn up the heat from Range or Oven the motor cant handle it. It squeals and moans. STAY AWAY.
3,Just ok,This range hood was ok. It works fine it just seems like it is made cheap. So far I haven't had any problems with it but have only had it a few months. It serves it's purpose and was inexpensive.
2,Wrong colour,"the range hood i order was supposed to be in white, why you send an almond colour and mark in the box that is white whne you know for sure that was almond."
4,Fantastic and Challenging little book,"This short little book is very thorough and challenging, I am still reading it so I can't be more conclusive than that"
1,Very disappointing!,"I've read many of Tom Clancy's books, and enjoyed many of them.But not this one! This is simply the worst Tom Clancy book I have read. The highly technical descriptions that I count on from Clancy are missing from this book. Most glaringly, the virtual reality descriptions in this book are simply not believable."
3,"main plot was interesting, but not enough","Having read one of Clancy's previous novels as well as seeing the Net Force movie despite a friend's advice, I found some of this novel really good reading. The side plot of Jay Gridley was great. And the Rushkyo guy was fun to read too.However, the very ending of the book, about Alex and Toni and Alex's ex-wife left me perplexed... where is Clancy going with this! Other than ""humanizing"" some of the characters as one other reviewer mentioned, I'm not sure that it's entirely relevant. Same with the boomerang kids. Unless they're going to jack into VR and help their parents solve some crime, it's not really needed in the storyline.All in all, not a bad book, but not a great one either."
1,Don't buy this book,"This book is devoid of Clancy. There is no hero. The villian is vanquished by another villian, who is vanquished by ANOTHER villian. The depiction of cyberspace patrol, even in a VR world is totally unrealistic. The Net Force team gets absolutely nowhere with their case.The reading is slow, the action boring, and the supposed good guy loses out in the end.There's even a totally unrelated side plot consisting of a petty teen relationship.Definately NOT Clancy's team's best. Clancy is know for being realistic and having done his homework. This book is not worthy of that name.If there were a zero star rating, this book would get it."
3,Not bad-not great.,"OK I'm a CS Graduate so a lot of the technical stuff in this book made sense(The ""Quantum Computer"" is as of now just a theory).The book though seemed to bog down with personal details, how did John Howard's son's social life fit into the plot of the story? Also the little ""Love Traingle"" didn't add antything to the plot either.Also the ""Captains Log"" format got a bit weary.The action though was typical Clancy, tight and fast. There just was too much unnecessary development in my opinion."
3,Blah Blah Blah,This book keep lagging on about stories that did not even include the main plot of the story. Many of them about some pretty dumb relationships. The ending was not as exciting as other Clancy books so to get to my point..Don't waste your time on this book.
2,Bad and getting worse,Tom Clancy should fire his ghostwriter before he puts him out of business. I found this book almost impossible to read. The characters were bad and the plot was terrible. I hope he starts taking his writing career a little more serious. I pray that Bear and the Dragon were written by the old Tom Clancy.
3,Mmm...,"The book makes for light entertainment, but does not compare with previous works. The virtual reality sceneario of catching a computer hacker is an interesting way to depict a very complex and technical operation.To me, factual correctness is important in a novel. In London, patrons do not spill out of a pub after midnight, as described in the book. The pubs close at 11:00 pm, and most Londoners make it home before midnight because the Underground stops running at midnight. Only a few nightclubs have licenses to remain open till 3:00 or 4:00 am."
3,Not one of his best.,"As a MAJOR Clancy fan, I found this disappointing. I felt the ""Romance"" between Alex and Toni, flat and boring, the tenison ie:jealousy too contrived. Now the ""love"" interest with the teens had more substance and validity. I found the Cyber RW vs VR entertaining and some of the most interesting chapters of this book. I was also very beguiled by the Russian assassin, felt his pain and sadness. Intrigued by his abilities, what does it take to make a human into this kind of killing machine? None of which was clearly answered in this book."
2,Disappointment,"This is the very first Clancy novel I've tried and I wasn't much impressed. Basically a Sidney Sheldon melodrama with some science fiction tacked on. Also there were some unnecessary subplots that were weak and irrelevant (the colonel's son, the agent's love triangle, the female monk...). These took the edge away from what I thought was going to be a to-the-point, intense SciFi-thriller. Not a complete waste of time, but not time well spent."
1,Don't bother reading it-I didn't,"I read the first book in the net force series, and I thought that it was ok but that it just wasn't up to par. I haven't bothered to even read the next two in the series, but from what I have heard, they are worse than the first one. I think, just like a lot of other Tom Clancy fans that Mr. Clancy needs to stick to writing his own books rather than stamping his name on someone else's book. My advice is that if it says Created by Tom Clancy and... don't read it-yor are just wasting your time. All of Tom's other books that he didn't co-write, such as Clear and Present Danager, are much much better and I would recommend them any day."
1,"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, 3)","There was once a time when I was an avid Tom Clancy reader and even put up with the Op Center series which was far below what I saw as the Clancy standard. Net Force is another case entirely. This series, and this book in particular, is terrible. The plots are ridiculous, the characters are shallow and unsympathetic, the writing is formulaic and overall it appears that the authors ""phoned it in"". No more for me!"
3,not his best,"I've read some of his other books that have been better. The story was a little disjointed. He had some characters like Mikhaly Ruzhyo, and a few others that had great potential, but he got too many things going at the same time and too little time for each of them to develop properly. I did like the way he portrayed Lord Coswell, the English billionaire. He figured he was a law unto himself and seems to have gotten away with murder (kinda like what's happening here in the United States). I enjoyed the book but it wasn't his best."
2,Skip it,"Not up to Clancy standards. The main premise is compelling- What might happen if a technological advancement were developed which could quickly break large prime number encryption, upon which the security of the world depends? A real theoretical possibility... This premise kept me reading right to the anti-climactic end. Some of the characters are interesting, like the Russian fellow who had a great subplot going, but even his ending is a letdown. The 2 main love stories are tiresome, detract from the main plot, and take up way too much ink. The virtual reality subplot is a leap of faith.Not worth reading.Currently reading Without Remorse, which is much better so far."
1,What's Clancy shoving down our throats now?,"Now don't get me wrong. I love Clancy's work dearly. But when he writes this junk to make a buck or two, you have to be a little annoyed. more ""Virtual Hackers"" plunges into cyberspace, wreacking havoc wherever the go. This book could have been doon in 100 hundred pages. And what the heck is Howard's kid doing taking up page space to dote on ""Who is the girl of my dreams?"" Nobody cares. Also it had a few too many ""Hot"" scenes. Come on. These people are profesianals. They don't try to lure co-workers to having sex with them on massage tables. And the perfect Spetznatz agent who can shoot the barreles of five CIA agents before they can blink is an annoying character who lacks deph. The only thing this book is good for is kindling. If you want to read a real book, read CArdinal of the Kremlin. Save this junk for the garbage."
4,Trouble in paradise for Toni & Alex,"Their May/ July (not really December) affair is in trouble due to another woman putting the moves on Alex without him really reciprocating. Meanwhile, Col. Howard's son Tyrone meets a nice girl to help him get over vain beauty Bella. But can he really get over her? One humorous note, though. The new girl has this strange stopwatch. No batteries, no solar power. Would you believe it has a SPRING and you actually WIND it! Otherwise, VR whiz Jay Gridley is after this hacker and the guy sends him a mild stroke online. Which knocks him out of the box, and if too many people take this part of the story too seriously, it might start a Luddist phobia against VR that will more than counter the bunch who've made a secular religion out of gizmos. That would be a shame--what about those of us who aren't computer enthusiasts but find the gear...er um...useful?"
1,"Night Moves (Tom Clancy's Net Force, 3)","Coming from the author who wrote Hunt for the red october, this book is down right pathetic. Dont waste your time reading this book.Also, there are horrible inaccuracies in this book. One example:""Moksha"" is translated as ""enlightenment"". Moksha actually means ""release from the cycle of life and death""."
4,good book,"I have always enjoyed Catherine Coulters FBI Series, in fact this is my second time through."
1,becoming a right-wing nut job.,I have read and enjoyed many of Coulter's books. Her imaginative stories and interesting fully developed characters were intriguing with only the slightest hint of political bias. Now the depth of character and plot have dimenished drastically and the political self-righteousness has taken over. If I could give it less than one star I would.
3,Ending Disappointed,"I love the Sherlock/Savich series, but I had problems with this one. First of all, I felt that a psychic experience was out of place. Sherlock and Savich are professionals; the ghost story line didn't fit in. Secondly, there were a lot of contradictions in the book. For example, I didn't buy that the judge married Callie's mother to get to her. It didn't jive. Callie respected the judge and was intuitive enough to know if he was interested in her or not. There was no evidence that he was.I, especially, disliked the way things were tied up at the end. The last quarter of the book didn't fit with the first three.So many of my favorite authors are cranking books out due to publisher induced deadlines. They suffer as a result."
2,swoop,"As many other reviewers said this plot could be much better exploited. The haunted part of the book is so pathetic that you can skip it just when you start reading it. It doesn't have any sense and it was written just to fill more pages in the book.When you read a spies' book and the FBI doesn't had any lead to the killer and the killer just give up because he thinks that he doesn't have to live anymore is pathetic, and more if this killer is an expert sniper and turned down the FBI twice before.The plot is interesting and will keep you reading until the end, but at the end you'll be so disappointed that you'd have thought that you'd never have read this book. I think you can skip this one and look for other FBI or spies' books from other writers for example:'Dead Ringer' by JASMINE CRERSSWELLor 'Blind Run' by PATRICIA LEWINamong others."
3,Left Wondering...,I've read the Sherlock/Savich series from the start - this one left me wondering if I was reading the same author. The dialogue was week and the story line lame....and how realistic is it for a parent to put a child in a dangerous situation - where the earlier books were at least believable - this one left one with the thought that little thought was put into the depth of the story line. Come on Catherine - get it together - or more people will be going to the library!
1,Blow Out,This book reads like the first rambling efforts of a high school girl. The mixing of romantic patter between the main characters while they conduct an FBI investigation into brutal murders clearly does not work. Skip it.
3,disappointing ending,"This is the second of Coulters books that I have read where the ending was highly disappointing. The book is typical of the FBI series, and following well known characters is fun. However, after Savage and Sherlock spend a whole book chasing the killer of a supreme court justice, the motivations given by the killer in the final scenes is anticlimatic, furthered by a plot twist that had the potential to be huge, but was largely dismissed. It was a good read, just left me a feeling a little let down with the ending."
2,"Weak plot, disconnected","This was the first book from CC I ever read, and I won't be looking for another one. The plot is thin and there is simply no actual problem solving. The protagonists come to decisions simply ""because"". The use of the MAX computer to find the murder - OMG, what a cheesy resource... The ending is also probably one of the weakest I have ever seen, unexpected in a bad way, disconnected to all the previous threads she mentions througout the book. In short: don't waste your time."
1,Awful...,"I won't buy Coulter books any more. The dialog is incredibly bad the plot lines are non-existant. What was with the ""ghost""? Why title the book ""blowout"" when the story revolves around the murder of the Supreme Court Justice. And if the author was trying to throw in a romance between the reporter and the cop, she failed miserably. Not even worth checking out for free at the library."
2,coulter misses this time,"I was very disappointed in Coulter's latest work. She took a potentially complex story and ""shrink wrapped"" it. How naive does she think we are? Then to add the paranormal story was just too much. It was almost embarassing. Are the editors reading this stuff before they publish it; or do they believe that we will read anything by certain authors? It is insulting. I was expecting much better from a very good author. But lately many of these popular authors have been just going through the motions and not really trying to give something new. They just need to bring out a new book every year. Do us a favor and take your time."
1,Can I have the last four hours of my life back?,"Talk about a huge waste of time. There are basically two separate plots in the book: one involving a ghost haunting an FBI agent and another where the same FBI agent is investigating the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The only connecting thread between the two loosely woven plots was that the same FBI agent was working on both cases. That's it. The title of the book has no bearing whatsover on the main focus of the book - the Justice's murder. The ""blow out"" refers to the ghostly plot, which in fact, is miniscule both in scale and importance to the entire book. The respective endings of both plots were so unbelievably anti-climatic, I kept turning pages just to see if there really was ""more."" There wasn't. This is the first and last book I'll ever read by this author. Although it was a very quick read, I still feel like it was a waste of an afternoon."
2,"Blow out, I think not.","Very disappointing. I was looking forward to this book because I buy all of her books. It took me a minute to get into the book, and besides that I was very easily interrupted. It did not capture my imagination. I could not believe that they brought a person who is on a hit list into their home even though they have a son they love so much. The book was all over the place. All of a sudden, MAX came up with the name of the murderer, just like that. It was just so out there. I liked the Samantha Barrister secondary plot line better than the main plot. Maybe that should have been the main plot. It was hard to believe that the judge was having an affair. The way everyone described him as being private and waiting patiently to marry his wife, does not jibe with him being an adulterer. Instead of paying your hard earned money, I would go to the library and check it out."
1,Terrible!,"The whole time I read this book I was thinking, ""Are they kidding? They actually think we'd BELIEVE this stuff? Did the Publishers and Editors actually read the book before releasing it?"" So many things wrong with this book that I don't think I have the space to write them all down. Here are a couple...1) The dialog is so unbelievable that I was laughing. The characters are too long winded. 2) The main plot-line was horrible. You couldn't even GUESS who did it because they just picked the bad guy out of thin air at the end! And the reason why he did it was laughable. 3) CC needs to research police policies...no Cop would EVER, I mean EVER blurt out every single detail of the investigation to a reporter, victim family members, and other suspects in the case. I mean, PLEASE!Readers, do yourself a favor, skip this one."
1,Horrible,I am a huge Catherine Coulter fan and have read most of her books but I have to say this is one of the worst books I have ever read. The ending was beyond horrible. There wasn't a true ending. The plot and characters were so underdeveloped. I could not find any reason for Callie and Ben to get together. Suddenly they were in love. This book was just horrible. If you must read it borrow it do not buy it. It isn't worth the money.
4,I really enjoyed this book,I am a great fan of Sherlock and Dillon and I found that this book didnt disappoint!!!! Lots of mystery and intrigue and great escapism.
1,STOP THE PRESSES!,"I have read all of Coulter's books, some more than once. Her Regency-era romances were usually witty and fun and her early FBI thrillers were actually good. This one is just bad. It had good primeses but bad characterization, bad dialogue, no plot, stupid cops and a spectacularly bad ending. She should never have let this one go to print.By the way, I checked the other reviews written by the three people who have given this book a five-star rating. Who's paying these people? Two of the three have written dozens of reviews, giving nearly every book a five. Either they have no taste or they are shills."
2,did she get paid by the word?,"i've never read a book with such banal chit-chat--the dialogue was just plain bad! if she'd have cut out about 200 pages of dialogue maybe i'd have muddled through it. as it was, i disn't care who killed who."
3,"I like the characters, but...",the book itself was a bit disappointing when all was said and done. It took me over a week to read this book which says something. But I did finish it.
2,Disappointing,"I've never given a bad review before, but I feel compelled to this time. Judging from the others, I'm not the only one who was disappointed. I expected more creativity from Ms Coulter, especially since the story was about the killing of a Justice of the Supreme Court. Unbelievable subplots and an anti-climatic ending made for an extremely disappointing conclusion. Sorry, Ms. Coulter. I expected much more from you."
2,Blow Out? Guess you could call this book a blow out.,"I'm a long time Catherine Coulter fan who was sadly disappointed ""again"" with her latest effort. I'm glad I decided to borrow from the library instead of purchase this book. I see no reason to rehash the plot(s). The pointless plot digressions drove me crazy. In this case ""less"" would have definitely been ""more"". I found the that the characters dialogue was stilted and boring and you never really felt like you got a grasp on each characters personality. I kept reading thinking that plot and characters had to come together and gel, but unfortunately they did not. I have begun to wonder if the same person is writing these books or if a change in editor is what is ruining her work. I would suggest skipping this book and picking up one of her classics."
1,This wok is fake!!!,"Hi, do NOT buy a wok from the Wok Shop. I was in their store in SF Chinatown, and the owner kept telling me how great the cast iron wok they have is. I was a sucker... I bought the wok, and brought it home to my parents. My grandparents were over that night too. I forgot to mention that I'm Chinese...My parents and grandparents said it was a fake, that it's not really cast iron. It seems to have some kind of chemical coating on it instead. I should have known actually... I have a cast iron skillet from Lodge Logic or something like that, and lemme tell you, cast iron is HEAVY. This ""cast iron wok"" on the other hand, was extremely light. There was no way this wok is cast iron.Save yourself the money and the anger of getting jipped, and don't buy this wok..."
1,I didn't know what it was for then and still don't,I was just talking about this with my wife. I received this for Christmas one year and had no clue what it was or why my folks bought it for me. I don't know what ever happened to it and never cared. It's only memory for me was it was the most bizarre thing my parents ever got me.
1,Not what was expected,This is the cheapest toy I have ever seen. the plastic is very flimsy and it will not stay put together. It is not the ideal castle to play with maybe look at but if I know my son he would like to play with it.
1,Falls Apart,I agree with other reviewers - this toy is a piece of junk. Spend more and get something that works!
3,Neat play-set!,"My boys absolutely love this toy! It is made pretty cheap, but otherwise okay, for a couple months of play anyway. I guess just look on the bright side, it didn't cost a whole lot!"
2,take another take,"Some CDs in Blue Note's Connoisseur Series are gems that fell through the corporate crack, and some are sessions best left in the vault. ""Taru"" should have remained in the can. The personnel is top flight, but the material is mediocre.""Dee Lawd"" and ""Durem"" are inferior funk numbers. The rest of the tracks have an unfinished feel, as if the group didn't have enough studio time to polish them. At best, they're bonus tracks for other CDs.There's so much first rate Lee Morgan material. You can safely pass on ""Taru."""
2,A Shame,"As both a GD fan and a blue grass one, I was expecting so much more from this CD. It really should have been a no-brainer: take some of the more folkish GD songs (God knows there are plenty), get some top blue grass performers and let them have fun with them. Instead, what you get is a series of songs delivered in a sterile, flat, overly scripted manner with no spontaneity and no improvisation.There is only one song on the CD that really catches the spirit of blue grass and shows what this CD could have been, and that is Going Down the Road Feeling Bad. Interestingly, this is not even a GD original, but an old folk song covered by many blue grass artists (ex. Flatt and Scruggs' 'Lonesome Road Blues'). In short, the performers go wild with it, give it the full blue grass treatment, and deliver a very, very interesting version. Why they could not do the same with all of the other songs is a mystery.This could hardly qualify as a tribute album."
2,Great Idea - Bad Execution,"I listened to this CD a few times, and I tried my hardest to like it, but the more I listen, the more flat and unimaginative it sounds. It's too bad, because I love bluegrass and the Grateful Dead."
1,Look for Old Timey music...stay away from this,"Ok. So you enjoy bluegrass music!! You think this may be nice, what your looking for, something neat............it's not!This CD is not at the heart of the Dead, it isn't jamming music...but stale.....tough......typical low budget bluegrass. If you want hot Blue Grass go for Old and in the Way!If I may add, check out Tommy Jarrel and Fred Cockerham...they have several CD's. These are the boys JERRY listened to and became interested in the Banjo and playing music. This is THE VERY BEST jamming aside form the Dead."
1,What The...?,"Grateful Dead songs can so easily be transfered to bluegrass but this is possibly the lamest example of bluegrass I've ever heard. These songs scream for bluegrass vocals, but there are none. What a waste of time.I mean come on, Cumberland Blues with out vocal harmonies? The producer of this piece of crap should never be allowed to make another album. I know this is an overly harsh review, but SHeeessh."
3,Next time hire a vocalist!,"I tend to agree with the one star review below, but not to that extreme. Much of the Dead canon would make fantastic bluegrass music, and it's great that someone is trying. These renditions are clean, crisp cuts of tight bluegrass that don't quite achieve the bounce and spontanaiety of the originals. That's understandable...bluegrass tends to be very tight, rehearsed, and laid out ahead of time. Everyone takes a little lead, and the song's over. But the big drawback is the lack of vocals. Much of what is irreplaceable and addictive about the Dead's music is the lyrics, not just the melody. Friend of the Devil is a great tune, as is Scarlet Begonias, but how much flatter and less interesting they are without the wonderful words behind them! I haven't gotten vol. 2 yet, but I sure hope they have a singer this time. Reccomended, with this caveat in mind."
2,Elevator Dead,"As a Deadhead and a bluegrass fan, I caution like-minded souls to avoid this album. A few of the tunes are enjoyable in an amusing way, but most sound like countrifed Muzak versions of your favorite Dead tunes. And to call this stuff bluegrass? Come on! If you need your bluegrass to have a Dead-angle, try any of the three great Old & in the Way albums. They'll spend more time in your CD player than this forgettable attempt to cash-in on the obessiveness of us Deadheads. (Hey, I guess it worked, I bought the CD!)"
4,Option Analysis for Trading Systems,"Katz's book on Advanced Options Pricing offers traders additional insight into limitations and errors found in traditional pricing models. For those of us that write mechanical options trading systems, particularly combination models, Jeff's book is a must read. If you are an options price researcher looking for in depth advanced pricingmodel discovery, analysis and mathematics, this book is probably not for you. However, if you are looking at ways to improve your existing models thus converging the error between empirically derived options system equity curves and those equity curves derived from options models, you should read this book. As most traders know, efficient entry and exit points in the market often occur during periods when pricing models break down, so the more you can learn about options behavior during this transient period, the better your overall trading system will be."
3,Very complicated and difficult to obtain ingredients,"I enjoy the food at Nobu and thought I would try out a few recipes. However, almost every recipe that I read had ingredients that were unfamiliar ( Japanese) and very difficult to locate. The whole effort is not worth it. However, the photographs of the food are quite beautiful. Frankly, a better coffee table book than a cook book."
3,Mixed bag,"I bought this book because it is one of the only cookbooks I have found to contain recipes for Monkfish Liver (Ankimo), which I have frequently been in search of. I haven't tried any of the other recipes, although anyone who does must be prepared to go on some serious hunting missions for some hard-to-find ingredients. Also, I too was put off by Nobu's shameless name dropping-- why do Kenny G, Madonna and other celeb quotes get more of a spotlight than Ducasse, Keller and other major chefs? I could care less if DiCaprio sometimes indulges his petit frame with--count it--TWO PIECES OF SUSHI instead of ONE!!"
1,Oh my...wasn't expecting this...,"I have really liked all of Hannah's books and I couldn't get through this one fast enough. It was awful. The subject was good, but all the rest just seemed like she was trying to fill pages. I am still a big fan of hers, I just didn't like this one."
2,This one didn't do much for me,"I had a difficult time getting ""into"" this story. In fact, I never did enjoy much of anything about it. Sorry, Kristin. I finally gave up & just put it on my bookshelf, mostly unread."
3,Better than the first book I read by Ms. Hannah,"Let me say that I love a good time-travel romance.Alaina ""Lainie"" and Killian each have scarred pasts. They meet up when Lainie finds herself in 1896 Arizona. Unfortunately for half the book she considers herself dreaming. Of course, Killian thinks she might be crazy but there is a pull between the two of them with plenty of tension. I would have enjoyed seeing a smoother transition of their love for each other. Their relationship is bumpy and I was surprised that Killian considered letting his men have their way with her.I can't put a handle on Ms. Hannah's books yet since this is only my second one that I've read of hers. It seems like there is plenty of promise when the books start out but everything should flow smoother. I would still consider reading other books of hers; I am just hoping that her writing style will improve."
1,What was she thinking?,"I've read many of Kristin Hannah's books and enjoyed most of them. This was a total flop, in my opinion. Trying to be serious, it was almost comical and I had a hard time finishing it. Hannah has a very unique style, but missed the mark with this one."
2,Not as good as what I had expected,"I really thought from the reviews that I would enjoy this book. It had an interesting concept with the author finding herself living the plot of one of her books, but I couldn't finish it. Halfway through it fizzled out for me and I just didn't care even to skim to the end to find out what happened."
5,Lightning Did Indeed Strike,"When Lightning Strikes is not your average time-traveling romance. It introduces you to two very interesting and unique characters. Alaina Costanza (Lainie), an edgy, wise-cracking romance writer with a rough past, and John Killian, or just Killian as he is mainly known, the villian from the historical western she is in the midst of writing. So when she gets struck by lightning, she gets way more than she bargained for!This book made me laugh, and at the same time it pulled at my heart. The chemistry between the two leads and their fighting that attraction was realistic and heartwrenching. Even though this is a romance, I was unsure of how it was going to end, it was a real nail-biter! I couldn't finish soon enough, and when I did, it left me feeling fulfilled. I couldn't recommend this book more!"
3,Too Unbelievable,"Two plots unwind and they are both unbelievable. This highly stylized novel lacks credibility all around. Unlike a novel like ""D'entre les Morts"" written by Pierre Boileau where plots elements push beyond the envelope, Boileau still told the story with credibility and that is what made it work. This novel fails in that respect and is relegated to nothing more than kinship to typical glossy romance novels. All gloss and no substance."
1,What the hell was this?,"This movie made no sense, Don't waste your money or time. This was very confusing. It started out like a possible horror story and then turned into some crappy low budget film. Very surprised that Clive Owen would even do a movie this bad."
3,Not what I was expecting.,This movie did not do Clive Owen any justice. It was not what I was expecting out of Him. Would not watch again even shut movie off two thirds of the way thru. was kind of dull and boring.
2,Bomb,"Hard to understand what the heck is going on.... felt it wasn't delivering on the horror factor... and I like Clive Owen, but this film left me feeling... What the..."
3,good,Glad I rented it before I bought it. It is a good movie to watch but not enough to own. Love how you can direct stream to the Blu Ray and picture quality was good.
5,Another Eerie Hit From Spain,"Great storytelling! Intriguing, unpredictable. If you like movies that keep you guessing, this is your ticket. The parallel story lines are brilliantly crafted."
1,Hauntingly stupid,"It's official, Clive Owen will do anything. Worthless mishmash has contrived elements of countless other bad spook movies and thrillers. It needed ""The Beginning...?"" at the end for a cliche capper cliche but otherwise these leftovers are starting to ferment. This makes Darkness Falls look like Citizen Kane. Usually I end my reviews with a quote, the only appropriate I can think of is ""Why did you lie to me""."
2,Odd Movie,I like Clive Owen. But Mr. Owen you definitely do some odd movies. Sort of like William Defoe... I like Mr. Defoe but his recent movies are beyond odd. Mr. Owen hasn't reached the level of oddness as William Defoe but they seem to be in competition.
1,Not really,"The only interesting part was when the doctor said the father and daughter share a bond in terms of being terrorized by the same ""faceless"" man that haunted the father as a young boy, at that time it was him and his mother that shared the same ""faceless"" man. Nice visuals, though."
1,Awful,"What a waste of time this movie is. The movie is about the bogeyman and if that's what floats your boat you may like it. The child actor, Ella Purnell, has no inner life at all to bring to the screen. And the pay off at the end is not worth the price of admission."
4,Uniquely Surprising!,"Let's just say that this movie may appear as one thing when you start watching it. But it will become quite an interesting surprise as you get to the end. I absolutely loved the entire film and the pacing. I was skeptical about this movie at first but once I started watching I couldn't stop. I didn't give it 5 stars because even though I thoroughly enjoyed it, I wouldn't say it's the best I've seen this year. However, it is definitely a movie to watch."
2,Horrible film,I had high expectations for this film but was let down immensely. The storyline is very good but the way the story is told is not great. It could have been much much better but they all cant be great.
2,"Some ok parts, but not enought to save the film.","In my opinion, this film wasn't very good. I felt that the acting wasn't anything special, with the exception of Clive Owen. Owen didn't belong in this film at all, he was basically over-acting the movie. He deserves to be in well written films, unlike this one. The director wasn't bad, yet he wasn't amazing. Some cool shots, but yet again not enough to save the movie. If you love Clive Owen, give it a rental but I wouldn't expect much. All it is is a rental."
3,Onyx earrings,"They are OK , they appeared larger in the add ,was not happy with the size ,too small for a adult"
2,Don't bother,These earrings look actually better in the pic than on your ears. The onyx is nice but they are rather flimsy because they are so light weight. I found much nicer Earrings made of onyx in JC Penney and the cost- well it was also betterI would not recommend this item. They are not worth the money.
1,Vector Stoller-Too Small!!! Buyer Beware!!!,"This stroller looks good on paper(and in the picture), but there has been some type of oversite on the part of Eddie Bauer. The stroller seat is fine if you have an infant. If you have a larger child, the seat back isn't tall enough to support a child's head if your child is over the age of two. Depending the on size of your child. Also, once you have assembled the stroller to figure this out, BABY AGE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE STROLLER FOR RETURN!!!!! Nor will Amazon. Happy hunting."
2,Great stroller for babies,"This was very much like the stroller that you can rent at Disneyland, which was great for my almost 2 year old. Unfortunately though this product says it is for up to 40 lbs my child was too tall for it. She is 30"" tall and her head was about 4"" above the back of the stroller. Since the shipping is so much (the downside of Amazon Prime is you pay full shipping both ways when you return an item) we are keeping it. Anyone want to buy it? Never used!"
2,Introducing the New Testament: Its Literature and Theology,The text is wordy and often redundant. Some issues are discussed with far too much detail and reiteration while others are statements without meaningful diatribe.I did enjoy the historical presentations but the spiritual presentations were difficult to cull through and not very enlightening.
4,Exploring Meditation? Start with the Meditation Bible,"The Meditation Bible is a very good reference or resource for someone that is starting a meditation practice and would like to quickly explore the concepts and the basic practices. The second part of the book, Meditation Directory, does a good job of providing the concepts and practices relative to: calming & centering, living mindfully, healing body, mind, spirit, get moving, love and compassion, problem solving, dreams, and connecting to the divine. It's the best ""fast"" reference book I know that provides a quick glimpse of meditation. Not a meditation for dummies, but a book for the beginner - and we all were beginners at one time."
2,"loads of new age ..., not very useful ;(","I was hoping to make sense of all the meditation techniques in one place, the whys and the hows and got dozens of ""meditations for all imaginable purposes"", most based on some breathing exercises (without the whys and hows) and visualization.What a waste of perfectly good paper!2 stars cause I can imagine there might be people who might actually like this.. for whatever reason that might be.. bah.."
4,Great Overview,I have meditated for years and teach meditation to people new to it. I use it as a text book due to the variety of meditations. I like that it includes many different spiritual approaches to meditation and it is a resource that can be used as one continues to explore meditation.
5,The Best Meditation Book Ever,"One of the best books on meditation I've run across. Small, concise, to the point meditations for daily living."
5,Temptations from 3 Women!,"ROMANTIC EROTIC FANTASY DRAMA-What you desire, you cannot resist! Mark has it all: great looks, a gorgeous girlfriend and a successful career. But when he suddenly finds himself pursued by 3 beautiful women he discovers that some temptations are impossible to resist. Enter into a world of desire and pleasure: Animal Attraction II! Rated R, AUDIO: English Dolby Digital, 77 minutes, STARS: Jeff Davis, Amy Lindsay, Lisa Comshaw, Charlotte, Griffin, Angela Monroe, Ahmo Hight, Director & Producer: Mike Sedan, 2001."
2,"Great Book, Terrible Binding","Wonderful Robert E Howard volume is ruined by Del Rey/Random House crappy binding. Fell apart before first reading was over. Good advertisement for Kindle, but I like a book in my hand, not a computer."
1,great stories - poor binding,"The 1 star rating is for the binding. Just like the other reviewer said, this book fell apart after only a couple days of reading it."
1,awful,Disjointed stories. Some were not even complete. Writing was less than juvenile. Would not recommend to anyone who liked the recent movie.
2,Badly bound,"I love the stories in this book, even though several of themare unfinished. My problem is that the binding is so poor that awhole bunch of pages just fell out within a week of my purchase."
2,Mediocre,"This sounds more like a ""country gospel quartet"" collection. For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's ""25 Years of Bluegrass."" Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' ""Soldier of the Cross"" and The Isaacs' ""Increase My Faith"" or ""Pieces of Our Past."""
3,"Nice, but ""Essential""?","This is an enjoyable listen, but ""essential"" seems a bit much, given that it lacks some of the greatest bluegrass gospel musicians, folks like the Country Gentlemen, Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, Stanley Bros, Bill Monroe, and Ricky Skaggs (esp. his earlier albums). Buy it, enjoy it, but move beyond the ""essential"" if you want the best."
2,Mediocre,"For a much better bluegrass collection, try Rounder's 25 Years of Bluegrass. Much better gospel bluegrass CD's are Ricky Skaggs' Soldier of the Cross and The Isaacs' Increase My Faith or Pieces of Our Past."
4,nice accessory,"I bought this kit to use with the therabath hot wax therapy. The plastic sleeves are great. Like another user, I do the treatment just before I go to bed and sleep with the moisture and wax on my hands encased in the plastic sleeves all night. I like the disinfectant spray and the moisture lotion as well. The mits are ok, but they do not hold heat. I also wrap my hands in a towel; that seems to keep the heat in longer."
4,Dry Skin Relief!,"This is the best thing I've found to heal my winter dry skin. When I have a severe dry skin break-out, I keep the treatment on overnight. By morning, my cracked skin is soothed and well on the way to being healed.Of course you'll need parafin bath to use this product. I recommend the professional model which is big enough to use for your feet & elbows as well as your hands."
1,Not worth it.,"Bags are too large and difficult to use when you've a hand covered in wax. Gloves too large, don't keep in heat, slip off. Unless you have 3 hands (two to soak and one to put on gloves and pop a rubber band on your wrists to keep gloves from falling off) this product is not worth it."
5,I wish I could find Shocking Asia 2,I first saw this movie 7 years ago. I have since moved from the town I was in (where I rented the Movie) This film is great. Asia is very shocking indeed. Amazon needs to find part 2 of this documentary. It is just as great as the first one.
2,Ugh. This has been cut to pieces....,"This is not the original Shocking Asia in its entirety. I would say that this DVD is missing about 20 minutes of footage. If you look hard, you might find an original on VHS. This, however, was a complete waste of money. The video and Audio looks like a bad VHS rip."
4,Don't Watch While Eating Supper,"Japanese dwarf wrestling! Indian self-mutilation! Graphic butchery of animals! An actual sex-change operation! You get the idea...break out a six-pack and dig this entertaining MONDO CANE clone designed to make Occidentals tremble with rage and loathing. It's actually a well-done and rather educational film for those who can hack the subject matter. Picture quality is generally excellent, though a couple of tape glitches can be seen...not too bad, though, and not the DVD's fault, as they're clearly in the source material. I heartily recommend this disc to all seekers of the unusual, but, need I add: be careful who you allow to watch, as it's not for kids or the easily offended. Watch for SHOCKING ASIA 2!"
3,Is this for you? well....,"Shocking Asia is a natural look at cultures outside of the U.S. of A. It bluntly shows how much more 'civilized' we really are. In the video you'll get a glimpse of piercings, penis removals, sexual parades, etc, etc, etc. And yes, it is shocking."
1,not good,I opened a new package and took out a new bulb and it didn't work in any of my lamps. I thought since it was a brand name the quality would be better. There have been 4 bulbs that have either blown when I screwed them in or didn't work at all. I am only half way through the pack.
1,2nd bulb did not work,"The first bulb worked. The second bulb did not work. Technically, I did not get what I want and I do not want to return all 24 for 1 bad bulb."
3,"A good resource, a bit dated","This book has some very practical advice for elminating asthma triggers in the home and how to prevent flare-ups at school, summer camp etc.The book was printed in 1994, so it is ten years old, and there are new medicines and puffers available today, but the theory in the book still applies and it was very helpful.3 out of 5 stars"
2,old habits are hard to break,takes getting used to. often difficult to get a straight cut because it needs a perfectly straight edge for the fence. cutting an 8 foot board is tricky if you dont have much space
1,horrible service,"Did not receive product. After contacting, still no response. No product and no refund. They stink!!!"
5,movie,Great funny movie lots of laughs my mother in law loved it she watches it over and over now she is telling her friends
5,Nice job,I was pleased with the results of this purchase. I received the DVD I ordered in record time and it was in perfect condition. I so love this movie and was happy with it when it was received. Nice job to the seller. Keep up the good work.
4,Play The Game - Unexpected Joy,Great movie for ages 18 to 108. Andy Griffith plays his character to perfection. Great movie to brighten your day and put a smile on your face.
4,Assisted Living Residents really liked this movie!,I bought this for my residents in an Assisted Living Facility. They laughed so much watching this movie. I'm sure they will watch it again and again.
3,Cute for senior citizens.,"I can't believe that some prudes gave this a bad review because of the content. You shouldn't give a bad review because you thought it was a family film and it is about sex, it is not a film for children. Most mature senior citizens will get some big laughs out of this film, which is about an 84 year old man who is lonely and wants to meet a companion. His grandson gives him advice on how to pick up women and as it turns out there's a nice twist at the end."
4,Funny and Entertaining,"Cathy and I watched on a drizzley rainy night. It can be entertaining for people, and families dealing with parents, in approaching that time in their life."
1,NOT family friendly!!,"Our family got this movie because we thought so highly of Andy Griffith.We could not have been more disgusted and disappointed.I was under the impression that Mr. Griffith was a christian, however, his behavior in this movie does not represent his belief in any way.I am so angry that my son and daughter had to witness such behavior. We thought we were were getting family friendly and ended up with porn!"
4,Play the Game,"I bought this movie because it had been recommended to me. It was everything I expected and more. The movie is filled with pathos but extremely funny and appropriate for all ages. It is the perfect combination of funny, serious and ironic with some romance thrown in! A great family night movie and one you just want to watch over and over."
2,Andy Griffith-Play the Game,"quite disappointed in some of the charachter Andy played in this movie. Overall it was funny at times, I would not have bought this movie had I seen it before."
5,"Surprisingly good movie, lighthearted adult movie","This movie may look a bit cheesy from the cover, but the story is quite good and interesting. Most movies like this has dumb plots that bore or frustrate the viewers, but this movie has a really good cast, and excellent writing. Quite an amazing lighthearted movie that won't insult your intelligence, and make you laugh a lot in the process."
1,So unbeliveably disappointed- still weirded out.,"If you love Andy Griffith and think of him as a sweet, well respected Christian man, DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. I am hoping that when Andy watches this movie now, he regrets it. That would be the only thing that would help me get past his references to oral sex, constant arousal and viagra. He encourages his grandson to forsake chasing after one-night stands and to look for ""companionship"". But by the end of the movie they've switched places and basically what Andy is looking for is sex NOT companionship. Poorly written, terribly acted (except for some early scenes with Andy) and pathetically casted. I can't believe the freaky ""ice cream man"" (C-flick horror movie) is cast as the leads father. Truly-NO one else must have wanted to act in this mess of a film.Yuck!"
3,Slightly disappointing.,"Good illustration of why I never liked dating -- too many ""games"".Disappointed in the sex outside of marriage emphasis."
4,For Andy Griffith fans,Received when I should and this is a nice change of character for him which I always enjoy. A nice story and would recommendit.
5,Best Low Compression Stockings Ever!,"I really loved these stockings. Not as high of pressure as my Jobst, but more than plain TEDs. They make my legs feel great and I know I have some protection from DVT. Price was good and shipping was fast. I also love that they are closed toe, as all my TEDs but one are open and the one closed toe cost $35. They wash well and just feel plain great. I have to wear compression hose all the time, so these will be it. Great product! I will certainly be buying more."
2,Too thick,"These chips seem to be of acceptable quality, but they are entirely too thick. I have 13 dogs and a bag doesn't even go around...gets expensive very fast."
3,scientists are human beings,"several months ago, I read a book about the conquest of polio by Jonah /salk and the backbiting that went on between him and Albert sabin. Somehow, I always thought that scientists lived in a rarified atmosphere and were not prey to the human foibles of character that beset most of us. that book, and now this has disabused me of that notion. Penicillin, which has saved zillions of people from death was brought into being as a result of collaboration amongst several scientists, although Fleming has gotten the lion'sshare of the credit. Seen aginst the backdrop of England fighting the scourge o f Hitler and the less than idyllic private lives of the scientists, this book made for a fascinating read."
2,Minotaur Should Be Avoided,"The number of things wrong with this film abound, and I don't even know where to begin.There are so many gratuitous scenes, and the character development was awful. Characters were introduced or slightly beginning to develop, and then they were killed off. Even the ones that survived, I didn't care about. Heck, I wanted the Minotaur to make it. The characters seemed weak, and the Minotaur was the only one who I felt sorry for, being born and then trapped away."
4,Mostly fiction but pretty good iron age flick,The script and actors of this film were all amazing {considering the fact that most sci-fi thrillers are bad}.The story begins with the birth of the minotaur its parents the queen of Minos and the bull god. As the beast grew so did its hunger and it killed the prince of Minos. To avoid letting the people knowing what happend they put a tax on the villages surrounding Minos- 8 youths must be sacrificed to the minotaur.Theo the shephard adn 7 other youths go to Minos Theo only wanting to save his love Ffion finds that she is dead and he must kill the bull.So the deaths of the movie were graphic except the 2nd death horrible cgi.If u want to buy this movie make sure you get fullscreen :}
1,It's a stinker.,"Even Tom hardy himself says this movie is a stinker. It is not a very well developed story line, and you don't really develop an emotional attachment to any of the characters. It is confusing at times to figure out who is who. A new character is introduced so shallowly. Bad movie."
1,Major disappointment,"How could I resist a movie starring Rutger Hauer and Ingrid Pitt? And based on the Minotaur legend, it sounded very interesting. And it's obvious that a lot of money and effort has gone into making the scenery. Unfortunately, that's the only good thing that can be said about the movie. It's a mystery how anyone could greenlight such a bad, incoherent screenplay. It starts out okay but goes downhill very quickly and after less than half an hour you're just hoping the movie will end soon. And for Mr. Hauer and Ms. Pitt, they don't have more than a couple of minutes of screen time. ""Minotaur"" is definately not worth wasting time and money on."
2,Has anyone here reviewing actually seen the DVD?,"Amazon is not selling the movie as it was on TV, they are selling the DVD (which is R-rated). Nothing actually shown on Scify could get an R if it's life depended on it. SO, I'd love to see a review on the DVD itself and the film as on the DVD. But, I do not plan to be the first to buy it.Please resist reviewing DVD's based on the film as it showed on any station with advertisers."
2,Done before,"The story is some rewrite of an ancient greek story of the minotaur. The story is weak, the acting and character development is poor, and the special effects are ordinary.Give a miss"
5,A Wondeful Book!,"This book was written by my great-grandmother and it is a truly touching story. My grandmother ordered many copies of this book from Amazon for my family. Unfortunately, she recently passed away. This book explains the tragedies people went through during the Holocaust. It is an amazing and true story with many interesting and depressing events. I highly recommend this book!"
3,The Universe Held In Your Hand!,"It is humbling to be able to own a book containing images that one would never otherwise have a chance to see. This book is full of HUGE color photographs of Nebula, stars, planets and galaxies that are truly awe inspiring. I did, however, find myself a bit dissapointed. Many of the Hubble telescope pictures that I was hoping to see, were tiny on text pages while the big, blown up pictures were somewhat grainy and repetitive. Commonly, there were several pages in a row of the same majestic body shown from different perspectives. With so much universe to see, I think I would have preferred one fabulous picture of each individual celestial object instead of so many pictures of fewer ones. Still, an enjoyable, overwhelming book sure to make you wonder...what else is out there waiting for us to discover?"
4,Full disclosure: I have a family of boys,"I have a family of boys, and therefore my impressions of a book come through the lens of watching them with the book.Admittedly, this is a girly poem at first read, but we have studied quite a lot of poetry, and they are generally openminded kids.Luckily, we have read the poem on several occasions without illustrations, so they already had a pretty good feel for the images and ideas in the poem.These illustrations are half-way modern, and they illustrate the story. What I have liked about some of the other illustrators in this series is their ability to re-interpret the poetry and add some modern context of their own. These illustrations don't do that.Still, the poem itself is grand. And this is a high quality, well-produced book. Just... a little girly."
5,A no nonsense story with a point,"Rite of passage is extremely easy to read, and never slows down. It doesn't fill pages with useless bits. Every page has a point, every event has relevance. I think it should be back in print because it is very meaningful and should be recognised as brilliant. No Nebula winner should ever go out of print. The novel deals with real world issues such as growing up, while also delivering a hefty punch in the politics/morals department. I wouldn't say it is propoganda, but it does have a strong message to deliver. Read it if you like Orsen Scott Card and Kurt Vonnegut."
5,A Nebula-award-winner with real moral depth,"This is a deep story with much more to it than appears at first. It is not just a startling twist on the idea of a spaceship-based society, but also on the coming-of-age story, but with a real twist: as the rebellious young heroine learns more about what her own culture really does, the reader realizes that there are real moral issues here, not just conflicts of style. Real evil often is done by ""nice"" people, and it's good to see an example of this worked out in fiction (where it's safer to let ourselves consider the presence of real moral choices). It's a rather timely topic for the present decade, which may be why this Nebula-winning book is now out of print! Do find this one if you're at all tempted."
2,It doesn't pass Trial,"Rite Of Passage is the story of a young girl in a future spaceship getting ready for ""Trial"", which is something of a space Bar Mitzvah, albeit manyfold dangerous. There are some interesting points in the novel: a fast pace, a refreshing first person POV, along with some poignant fables the heroes come up with. There is also a nod (but just a nod) to philosophy. However, what really spoils this book is the Trial itself. Suddenly, it seems like Mr. Panshin passed his writing torch to Harry Harrison to create 30 or 40 DeathWorld like pages. And while Harrison's characters justify suspension of disbelief, Panshin's 14 year olds going around, blowing up army bases in a totalitarian society is unbelievable as well as unacceptable. 1968 crop must have been pretty poor for this to win the Nebula."
2,You get what you pay for,"These speakers have great sound when pluged into you pc with the usb. However the usb is so short (only about 10 inches long) that you can't place them on your desk if your pc is on the floor like most are. Also I thought the description stated there was an AC adaptor included, NOT! They work well with batteries, but the sound quality diminishes greatly and top volumn decreases. If your headphone jack is in the bottom of your unit, you can't set it in the tray provided. Ok, for the money, but not really functional."
3,An excellent example of Decisional Method Research,"This book continues to be the best example of an application of ""Decisional Method"" research on Community Power which tends to yield an answer of Pluralism in the way New Haven Connecticut was governed.Now, how much Dahl's results matter to you is another case--many believe his results are faulty due to the use of the Decisional method. The method itself is considered to be of limited use. The polar opposite of this book is Floyd Hunter's (1953) ""Community Power Structure."" Hunter used a ""Positional"" method and determined that the elite govern in Atlanta.Dahl's book is good for what it is, but it is not what experts on local political power believe now. To get a well-rounded education on local political power, read Hunter. To get up-to-date, read Stone (1989) Regime Politics (used Decisional and positional approaches together), and read Logan and Molotch (1987) Urban Fortunes. [Revised edition] 2007."

1,BUYER BEWARE,"Do NOT buy this microwave. We bought a GE microwave brand NEW and it was defective and would not work. GE refused to replace it. Instead, they wanted us to indirectly pay more for it by staying home from work (and lose pay) to wait for service instead of replacing a defective NEW microwave, that was broken straight out of the box."
4,Only way to go,"This is truly the only way to go. When you have a printer that is outdated and can no longer find the right ink, then compatible ink cartridges work just as well. At an amazing price, too."
4,A Raspberries fan's dream!,"I'm surprised that an arguably underrated band as the Raspberries should deserve such a lovingly edited book nearly 20 years after their break-up. Although I would have preferred a conventional biography, this compilation of news clippings and exclusive interviews is the sort of thing that makes the Raspberries look bigger than they really were - and will certainly make hardcore fans feel like paradise! It's never too late for a 70's band to get the recognition it deserves, as this book proves."
1,Not Comfortable with Teen Sex Scenes,"About midway it has Jen and her boyfriend in the bathtub together while her parents aren't home. It tells of her putting soap on him and rinsing it, then drying each limb. Yeah, not too comfortable having my 12 year old read that. There are also several crude words, including the F-word."
3,"Dark story, intricately woven","Someone is using the EROS online computer system to hunt for victims. And Harper Cole is the only one to figure it out. So far. The only one who's willing to tip off the police, anyway.Who knew that this one simple decision would affect so many lives? This is an intense, intricately woven story about the darker side of all of us. Excellent once again."
3,decent read,"This is my second book by Iles, first being THE QUIET GAME which was one of the best books I have read. I personally didn't like MF too much. The story was pretty interesting but I wasn't tpp excited about finishing it. The story was believable and characters well developed but it simply wasn't the kind of book I like to read. I'm sure others will be fond of it."
5,"Loved, loved, loved this book","I originally bought this book because of Greg Iles' connection to Ole Miss (my daughter just graduated from Ole Miss).But, I have to say what a surprise find this was. I loved this book. There were always twists and turns that kept you pulled into the book. I love his style of writing. He gives lots of details but he makes those details interesting. You don't want to skim through those filler details like most books. It makes the books I have read in the last year or so pale in comparison. I have subsquently bought 8 more of his books and have them stacked to read.As a Mississippian, I think his books are ten times better than John Grisham (another Ole Miss alumni)."
5,A KILLER of a Psychological Online Thriller,"Mortal Fear is Excellent! A fully gripping, edge of your seat, page turning, nail biting thriller. Mortal Fear is based around Harper Cole who works for an high class, high priced, high security sexual online service E.R.O.S. Women on the service are being murdered and Harper and his wife soon become involved in a terrifying game with a serial killer. This book will absolutely pump your adrenaline and leave you sweating and breathless. This is a must read! -Angela Bernardoni-"
5,excellent story that you can't put down,"mortal fear is one of the better adventure stories that i have read. the author weaves a plot that is interesting if somewhat incredulous at times. once you pick this book up you will not drop it until you have finished it. This story is much better than most of the ""formula"" plots with ""robot-like"" characters"
3,One of the best villains ever,"Even though the technological aspect of this book is totally outdated (frequent references to AOL and Compuserve - it is kindof comical) as I write this review in 2010, it is a total page turner. The dated computer references are minute in comparison to the storyline, however. This author has the most intense character creation and he is a top-notch writer as well. The most incredible character is the villain--a completely deranged psychopath that is part genius and part erotic mess (when you learn of his childhood, you'll understand why). The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because the main character's wife needed more development. She is so understated in the beginning and this makes her actions at the end of the story a bit unbelievable."
5,"622 Pages. But, It's Excellent","Harper Cole has a a pretty easy life. He never really is used to moving from his computer. He's a got a beautiful wife, money, a hot sister-in-law & he never really has grown up; until he enters a villainous world where he deals with a complete sick-o. He changes forever & needs to do it quickly.Taking place in New Orleans & mostly on the Mississippi Delta, Mr. Iles has put a great deal of detail into this novel. It's rather long at 622 pages. But, it never really bogs down. It's gripping & very difficult to put down. The story is told very well.It's a great summer read or a good companion on a long flight"
3,Good Thriller,"I liked this story other than the preachy way the author deals with idfidelity. A common theme in his books. I liked the technical concepts although pretty outdated. I liked the serial killer. Good villain. In the end, the killer always catches himself, which is a little cliche. Good believable characters including the technical genius friend that you can never trust because they are always such unbelievable dumbasses."
3,Killers on the Internet,"Pretty fair serial killer story with a modern, tech twist. It keeps you guessing but the chatroom mind game dialogue and the enormously frustrating immorality that occurs made me want to put the book down several times. The end is disapointing, as are most book endings. Typically, the tension builds until the end and then...the big letdown."
3,"Good, but no Black Cross","Mortal Fear has scenes of incredible suspence (for example when the cops go down in the underground corridor), gore and sex and whatnot - and some non-realistic characters, I mean, c'mon, Iles's FBI is a bit too informative toward their suspects :) -, but lacks the overwhelming grimness of Black Cross - now THAT is a masterpiece!"
4,Suspenseful,"I thought this book ran a little long at times in the middle of the story, but other than that, I really enjoyed reading about these characters. Had a hard time putting this book down towards the end. I recommend it to anyone who likes suspense novels."
5,wow,"as an ambitious author I read as a method of study as well as entertainment. Mortal fear was an excellent novel. A great story of love, hate, betrayal, loyality, and passion. It was tightly plotted with a plausible ending. Wish I had wrote it"
5,Hard to put down and in my case stop exercising,"I've been listening to the unabridged audiocassette (15 tapes). The plot, characters and suspense have me working out from my usual 45 minutes a day to an hour and a half from cassettes 10 to 15. For those of you who hate to work out and need to listen to something while you exercise, get this book on tape. My calves have never looked better."
4,suspenseful thriller,"that for some reason i think i may have enjoyed even more had i read it (i heard the taped version) . . . very contemporary, in that it is all about the internet and how a killer stalks his victims via an exlclusive sexually-oreinted online service."
2,My first and last,"I can't believe the number of four star reviews. Iles is probagbly the most in love with his own words of any author I have ever read. Boring, long winded, over done and loaded with technical errors. I read the first 30% and then the last ten and barely made it through. Maybe if I were into kinky sex"
3,"Tense, frightening, but ultimately disappointing","This book had me on tenterhooks for the two days it took me to finish it. I couldn't fall asleep until I had finished it. Greg Iles is a very talented writer with a gift for keeping you on the edge of your seat. However, in the long-run, I felt a bit disappointed in the book. Plus, the hero carries on and on about his illicit love for his sister-in-law. His doctor wife is an amazingly strong heroine with incredible character. The subject matter hits very close to home for people who spend a lot of time on the internet, and can make you feel very vulnerable and frightened. This is a highly readable book, but it is a bit like having a wonderful meal, but being left with a stomach ache."
2,"Another psycho-sexual thriller.....can you say ""sell out""?","I'm a huge fan of Greg Iles. I absolutely loved SP and BC, and was disappointed with Mortal Fear. First off, the first-person perspective got extremely annoying as I progressed through the book. First person perspective truly limits the development of other characters, since you are in the head of only one. In a novel of that length, I was sick of his character's whining and pining over his sister-in-law.....please! His ""bad guy"" was well done as usual, but the story was just another killer-thriller that clogs the fiction shelves of bookstores. I was hoping he could have gone the route of N. Stephenson's ""Cryptonomicon"", where high-tech meets history. Guess the money is in this....."
2,Below the gripping standard,This story doesn't measure up to Greg Iles standard. I got the impression he added fluff to meet a word/page count. I found myself scanning without losing content.
5,Suspenseful1,"This book weaves intrigue, suspense, sexual interest, and unusual detail with plot twists that are beyond what we would normally imagine. I couldn't put it down!"
4,First rate thriller,"I defy you to put it down. I read the book in a night-long sitting. As a Mississippian, I found his sense of place exactly right (unlike the faceless, placeless John Grisham). The suspense is unrelenting. Don't miss this one."
5,This is one of the best psychological thrillers ever!,"This is definetely one of the best books I've ever read! From the beginning of the book to the end, I couldn't put it down!!!"
5,very interesting thriller involving on-line chat rooms,"found this book in a laundrymat. by the time my dryer was finished, i was hooked on the book! great writer of dialogue, great plot, eye-opening look at internet security, regarding chat rooms. you never know who has your REAL address....!I also learned alot about how the internet works.Highly recommend this read, even if you're NOT stuck in a laundrymat."
3,A Little Disappointing!,"When I saw this book, I really thought I would be up all night with a great story full of suspense and a little bit of ``terror''. I found the premise of this book good, although I felt that it was a bit too long and the characters were a little unbelieveable. The part that disappointed me the most was the fact that the villain was never introduced to us in the book as a real person until they found out who it was. A book is better when the character is someone close to the crime and you never suspect them I hope the author reads this and finds some constructive criticism in my words. Isles is a good writer, just a little distracted with the story and not what the reader wants or expects. I will order from him again,I just hope I am pleasantly surprised..."
1,Absolute Drivel - Long and Boring - Crap,"Hardcover is 563 pages. This whole story could probably been written in 100 pages and been a short story. It is full of nonsensical details and really lacking of a crisp story line. I found as it droned on that I could skim perhaps 10 pages at a time and not loose the story line (which was silly to start with).And oh my, was it really needed to write every back and forth as they traded instant messages on EROS.The best part of the book takes place in the last 30 or so pages. But to tell you the truth, the best part for me when when I closed the back cover and said thank god it's over.I really enjoy Greg Iles, but this one is a real stinker.I have no idea how some people can rate this book a five, they must have either a very sortid taste, or just want to see themselves in writen form."
1,Could NOT finish....TOO Boring,I bought this book based on other recommendations and find that we really are all very different! I could not finish this book. I didn't care about the characters and even the story line didn't tempt me.I read at least four books a week and can't remember the last time I put a book down without finishing it! I've also deleted all the other Iles book's on my wish list.
2,Could Barely Finish,"This book is awful. Apparantly there are a lot of people who have a high tolerance for the unreadable. It is boring and poorly written. You will not care about any of the characters. The 'Big Secret' is so inane that you will be insulted by the fact that you are supposed to care. Trust me...I read lots of books, and this is definitely one to pass on. DO NOT waste your time or money."
2,mortal fear,"I could not deal with the fuzzy type interspersed throughout this book. Select a standard type style and stick with it. Italics are OK ocassionally but these eyes rebelled to the point I stopped the book and asked a friend to try it.He had the same complaint! Next time I encounter this style I will return the book for a full refund.As for the story, I will never know if it was any good.Other books I have read by the same author I liked very much.That includes Black Cross and Spandau Phoenix; they were great reads."
2,I'm a Greg Iles fan but....,"Jeepers, this was a hard book to stick with. It is not that there was not plenty of action. Iles never disappoints in that area. It just did not make a lot of sense and the characters were not believable. I have read all of Iles early works, then sort of got away from him. This book did not encourage me to find any others."
4,well written thriller,"Harper Cole is a system operator of a erotic on-line network. People log on to air their most secret fantasies and desires. He begins to worry when he notices that some accounts that were heavily used suddenly go dead and asks the police to check on the users. They turn up dead.With the police, psych doctors and friends in tow, Harper is out to catch the killer, using his own family as lures.I didn't really get into this story as other reviewers did, the characters didn't jump out and become real to me. The storyline was interesting though, for those who enjoy a thriller with something a little different."
4,Pleasing prose style and intriguing characters!,This is a story which captures the reader's interest right from the start. Ile's characters are well developed and interesting. The pace of the story makes the reader want to turn the pages faster and faster. Suspense continues to build until a thrilling (but somewhat confusing) climax is reached. Do read it!
3,Grab it at an airport,"IF you find yourself bored and need something mindless to kill time with, this is one of many fine choices. It's won't linger long, it's nothing too inventive and, like Spandau Phoenix, it falls apart rapidly at the end. On the upside it flows well and has some interesting, though contrived dialog.Since it is now the beginning of the 1998 summer season there are hundreds of better choices for pure entertainment reading."
4,Enjoyed the book,"It was a long book as mysteries go, but it had enough of a plot and subplot to keep me interested."
3,They're only into this when they're on catnip.,"One of my cats loves the Turbo Scratcher, so I grabbed one of these for him, too. Except he doesn't view this as an equal. In fact, he never plays with this. He just stares at it, sniffs it, and walks away.Until I give them catnip. Then this is the greatest toy on the planet. They lay there with their little stoned expressions and hit this thing until their high wears off. I guess it's a little disappointing that they don't like it unless they're on catnip, but at least they play it with sometimes."
3,Got the grandson this for Christmas.,"My daughter is years away from motherhood, so we refer to her cat as my grandson. This was the third Christmas I got him something. The first year I got him a toy where a ball can be pushed around a figure eight track - he loves it still. The second year I got him a toy shaped like a large metal wedge of cheese. It allows you place soft balls and treats inside - he hates it. This toy was given this year and he seems indifferent so far."
2,Disinterested cat,"I bought this toy online about a year ago--based on the positive reviews. I guess not all cats are the same because my 5 year old cat has never really found it interesting enough to play with--the ball on the track doesn't intrigue him enough to get him to play. Also, the toy on the perch is unnecessary -- cat hasn't even swatted it. Quite disappointed!"
1,Strange design paint,"My cat really liked the design...open on the side so she could lay down next to the toy and slap at the ball. But the design is painted on the ball in a puffy paint and prevents it from rolling smoothly. Unless I'm sitting there playing with her and keep the ball moving it gets stuck half way around...and she loses interest quickly. So for us, this toy is not great."
2,Not a fan.,My kitten played with this toy the day I got it for about 10 minutes and that was it. She's not interested in it anymore. Very disappointing.
3,cheese chase,My cat loves it! The outside ball gets stuck once in a while but is easily moved again with a tap of a finger or paw.
4,Nice cat toy,"My cats loved t his for about 1-2 days. They played with it a lot, but as time passed they lost interest. Cats are like kids, they all like different things. This toy was sturdy and kept their attention. I'd recommend it, but the level of interest will depend on your cats (kids)! Mine were 7 months old when I got the toy."
5,Fabulous Kitty Toy!,We bought this adorable toy for our new 4 mo. old kitten ~ it was a hit from go! She played with this toy all evening. She has continuously come back to the toy for more fun. She loves both ball sections and wrestles with the little mouse on top. We adore watching her play with this and seeing how much fun she is having. A good kitty workout! It is well constructed and looks really cute. You won't regret buying this for your baby.
5,Great fun,"This is a well-made track toy, with two tracks and balls plus a fat little mouse on top of a spring-thing. It's nice and sturdy and cute. I've had hours and hours of fun with it.Unfortunately, my cat has nothing but contempt for it. In the six months we've had this, she has slapped it twice, while I've tripped over it four times in the night.Still, I think this sort of toy would be a big hit with kittens, because by the time a cat has grown to adulthood, they've already figured out how pathetic you are with regard to toys."
5,"Surprisingly, Keeps the Kitten Entertained","When we received this product as a gift, I thought there was no way Milo (our 8 month old kitten) would play with this thing.It took him some time to warm up to it, but sure enough, he did. He lied down right next to it and put both front paws into the side, then hit the ball across with one paw, and back with the other.Weeks later, he still plays with this thing (at least once a day!). Other cats look entertained, but because he lies down to play with it, he just looks bored. Either way, it's something for him to do (as he is the only cat in the house). He plays with the mouse on the very top, which also surprised me. It does take up a bit of floor space (it was bigger than I had expected, but it isn't much of a problem).Overall, this is a great toy and I highly recommend it."
3,Move this toy around to keep intrest!,"My cat is hard to please. She likes playing with boxes more than store bought toys. This toy is a hit with her. She really likes it when we put it away for a day or so or if we put it in a new place every few days! It keeps her much more interested. It is a little noisy but she usually plays with it at night! (Bonus for us!) She has no real interest in the ball in the top or the mouse on top but LOVES the ball on the bottom ... it's her ""lazy toy"" she'll lay next to it and bat it to herself over and over again. Too funny!"
3,My cat seems to like it.,"I can always tell when the cat is playing with this toy because I can hear the swish of the ball going around the toy. He hasn't quite figured out to play with the ball in the center of the ring, but he will actually lay next the toy and paw at the ball getting the ball to go round and round."
2,4 cats say YAWN,"I got this toy based on the good reviews here despite the fact that I think it looks like an awful, ugly baby toy and is not only an eyesore in my living room but I'm sure the fact that it's yellow and blue and a number of other colors in VERY BRIGHT shades is completely lost on my cats. So, I tried it out on four different cats, from ages 10 months to 14 years and while their eyes would track it while *I* used it, that's not exactly the result I was looking for. My cats go crazy for Da Bird, the Cat Catcher and hand-held laser toys and they love to chase each other around for a couple hours a day, but this toy was a complete yawn for them. I even left it out for a few months hoping they'd suddenly ""discover"" it one day, but no such luck. So, I tried to sell it at a yard sale but no-one was even slightly interested."
2,Cats aren't impressed.,"Set this out for the cats and they have no interest in it whatsoever. eh. I will leave it out for a while and if the status changes, I will update my review."
3,Antiquarian Tastes,"1930s serials can have a charm of their own--wonderful nonsense. And coupled with aviation history, this makes ""Tailspin Tommy"" an interesting entertainment: How did those wobbly, fragile aeroplanes stay in the air?! And then what about that Oedipal subtext!"
1,unsafe,these shields would become airway obstructions in use since they fall apart when opened. i returned them a few weeks ago and have not heard anything back from the company - no returned money either.
2,CPR Shield Barrier,"I bought these to add to First Aid Kits at a school. The barrier is a thick plastic sheet with a hard plastic insert in the middle. Right out of the package, part of the plastic sheet is cracked at a fold. The insert is not a one-way valve, but does contain a filter. The lower portion of the insert is about 1 1/4"" x 1 1/3"" x 1/3"" and is intended to be placed between the victim's teeth during CPR. On an adult this might work, but could cause delay placing the insert properly. My main concern would be in using this in a child's mouth, which would have more difficulty fitting between the teeth, and could also push back on the tongue. Overall, this is an inexpensive barrier that might work for adults, but a different design might be considered for all uses, especially for children."
4,CPR Shield Barrier Pocket Masks,"This was the perfect item for me. I like to distribute them to my students in my BLS CPR classes. The fact that it is a ""one way valve"" was important."
1,Difficult to use,"I bought these, at first, thinking they would be useful in the car, and in my purse. But then I find these are to be used for CPR manaquins. Even at that, I found them difficult to use in a class with the manquins. I didn't think they were worth the money. The one-way valve resuscitator masks are much better and safer."
4,A great way to not get herpes while saving someones life!,"The shields I received does not fall apart like one user states. Stays together in one piece as it should.The CPR shield will not block bullets but it will stop blow back and prevent throw up in your face from helping a non breather.I have tested the ""one way valve"" and it works for the most part. It doesn't look like a one way valve since all you can see form the top is the filter. The only thing about it is that it may be a little difficult to get a good seal on the victims mouth because of the blow back vents.The over all size of the vinyl sheet is 6.5"" x 6.5"". The bite blocker is a little over an inch that protrudes into the mouth.I would say this relatively inexpensive and good thing to always have in your first aid kit."
4,Psmith in Another City - Rupert Comes to NYC,"""Psmith Journalist"" is the third Psmith novel and finds the hero cavorting in the New York City of 1914, as he unilaterally takes over a weekly newpaper, runs afoul of politicians and gangsters, and consorts with other gangsters to arrange for his protection. This sounds rather grim but actually Psmith continues to delight us with his humorous language and indomitable aplomb. As with the other early novels the final plot resolution is rather weak but not without being preceded by a hundred-odd pages of hilarious dialog and action. Moreover, the book provides a fascinating glimpse into the New York of a distant year, with which the author was intimately familiar."
4,Psmith,"Very funny. I love how Wodehouse uses language. If you like that sort of thing and you haven't read Wodehouse before, shame on you. If you do and you've read other Wodehouse books, well, it's like that."
2,Audiobook is a real let-down,"Maybe I've had an overdose of Wodehouse lately, having read Piccadilly Jim, Biffen's Millions, Plum Pie, and this book practically in a row, but I was simply not entertained by Psmith Journalist at all.Perhaps it was Jonathan Cecil's reading (and I know that had a lot to do with it). His characterizations are indistinguishable and his attempt at an American accent is laughable (if you have heard any Monty Python, you'll recognize it).But I think that could have been overlooked (or overlistened?) if the story had grabbed me. It seemed to be about Psmith taking over a New York rag and making it into a scandal sheet, involving a boxer somewhere along the way, but I can't be sure. I just didn't care, and I found nothing funny at all.There is nothing to offer the casual Wodehouse fan in this novel. However, I will read his work again, as he has so much to offer in other books.But I really think it's mainly Jonathan Cecil's fault."
1,Wrong cover!,"I must confess I have not bought or read this book but I was astonished when browsing through Amazon.com I came across it. The publishers have chosen for its cover a portrait of Spanish novelist Benito Pérez Galdós, as painted by the great Joaquín Sorolla! I do not know about people outside the Spanish cultural mainstream, but I believe that a book about the laughable adventures of a semi auto-biographical journalist would be better introduced by a picture of Wodehouse himself, and not by the image of one of Spain's most thoughful and profound writers of all time. A shame."
1,I can't believe a lid wasn't included with this pot,"I guess the joke was on me. I assumed that a lid would be included, but I guess that cost extra, or has to be purchased separately. I returned the item, because I didn't own any lids that fit this particular pot. And I wasn't about to go treasure hunting in my city to obtain one. Next time I'll be sure a lid is included before I buy."
3,Not exactly classic Revere ware,I bought this pan thinking it would open the world of steaming to my stove top. It did not; it is actually incomplete for steaming or double boiling as it arrives as you see it. It also was not the same sturdy construction as my other copper clad pots.
5,Live is Back,great cd if you get to know and appreciate a good song you will love it. go see Live in concert will blow you awayrockin PA
2,Not One of LIVE's Best.,"I love this band. They have an amazing amount of talent. However, this album has fallen short of their greatness. The first song is remenisent of ""The Distance to Here"", but you'll find out very quickly that this album lacks LIVE's creative song writing ability, and falls short of portraying their amazing talant. If you're a hardcore fan, I would buy the album, but don't expect greatness because it just isn't there."
3,Great couple of songs,"I like live's music, but this is the first CD of theirs that Ive purchased. The first song ""heaven"" is awesome. In my opinion its the best song they've released. My only problem with this CD, is that it strays from what I believe is Live's ""sound"". It doesnt come close to their earlier works. The only other decent song is ""every time i see your face"""
2,I don't get it...,"I'm very surprised to read how people are praising this album. I've listened to it many times since buying it and the album in general is simply... plain. There are no memorable tunes or guitar riffs, no catchy lyrics or melodies to pull you in. Tracks 1 and 5 are decent tunes, but that's about it. The previous album ""V"" at least had some fire in it. This album is very monotone and in some cases boring."
1,Letdown,"I love LIVE and have since their first cd. Yet the more I've bought every new cd that came out, the worse they have gotten. Yeah they've had their ""singles"" from each that are good, but the rest of the cd you just don't know what to do with.I went to the store to get this cd and was all excited thinking it would change my mind, yeah, it didn't. It's not worth it, I guess after the first cd they can't really make good songs you'd actually want to listen to and that don't all sound the same.No more LIVE cds for me"
3,Sounds like Throwing Copper,"My Rating - 3.3/5The songs on ""Birds of Prey"" sound like ""Throwing Copper"" but aren't as good. In contrast they are better than ""Distance to Here"" but less experimental. Live seems to be retreating to familiar musical territory, but can't quite seem to relive the glory days. Futhermore the album lacks those powerfully key defining songs like ""Lightning Crashes"" and ""Run to the Water"" that helped redeem their former albums. ON a posative note Ed Kowalczyk utilizes his unique voice wonderfully, perhaps more so than in other albums.Highlights - ""Heaven"" - Quintessential Live, right down to the fluctuating end of verse notes.""Out to dry"" - Has a good chorus to sing along to.""She"" - Chorus sounds great with his voice.Negatives -""Like I do"" Another experiment. This one didn't work so well."
1,"Come Back, Creed...All Is Forgiven [well, maybe not...]","A band so dismal that they aren't even totally heinous, yet nevertheless a laughing stock to valid music lovers since the lyrically pretentious, commercially tremendous, musically ludicrous and absolute guilty pleasure `Throwing Copper' sold a few million copies, even their ever dwindling fan base continues ignoring this welfare-U2, so Ed and co. come out of the sacred closet and declare their devotion to God and love and family and to hell with soundscan. Oops, did I say hell? Sorry Ed. My grade: C"
5,Best since Secret Samahdi,"I'm probably the only person who liked Secret Samahdi better than Throwing Copper. But I definitely agree that V was their worst album. This one has made up for it. They've gone back to their original sound (or similar to it at least) after trying something different on V and The Distance To Here. I could listen to this CD all day long, great work by Live."
5,A very good release,"I admit that I've liked all of Live's albums (even their much-maligned ""V"" album.) That admission behind me, I'll plunge into my thoughts on their latest work. I think that the most striking facet of this album is that it's their first one that does not contain any filler songs -- I didn't feel inclined to skip over any songs even upon first listening... If I had to attempt to define it based off of their previous works, I would liken it most to The Distance to Here... perhaps a bit less heavy, but sans sub-par songs (I'm being kind) such as Voodoo Lady and Sun.The song ""Lighthouse"" is (IMHO) among the best songs they've ever written, easily holding its place amongst such songs as ""Pillar of Davidson"" and ""We Walk in the Dream"". ""Lighthouse"" is followed by ""River Town"", another very strong performance.If there's anything to gripe about, it's that the 13 songs total only 44 minutes and change.. a bit short, but maybe that's because they cut out the filler stuff."
4,Looking for a good time?,"Well, I've been a +LIVE+ fan for about 5 years and I own all of their albums, I am a huge fan! First of all, I'd like to say I love this album. Its as simple as that. I think this would be a great ""starter"" album for any new +LIVE+ fans, because it has a little of everything. I don't think its their best album, but its better than 99% of the trash out there in the music world in this day and age. My favorite track is either ""Lighthouse"" or ""Like I Do"", I think they both exhibit +LIVE+'s uncanny ability to layer music; their music has so many dimensions! ""Every Time I See Your Face"" is a little pop-ish for +LIVE+, but I like it because Ed wrote it about his baby daughter. I think its sweet! Overall, its a killer album worthy of placement in any music collection. ED FOR PRESIDENT!! :)"
5,Back to classic Live,"I love this album. I feel Live went back to classic Live without some of the techno stuff they tried on ""V"". Not that I don't like ""V"". I am a Live junkie and listen to it all. I am just saying, this is a good CD and a must have for all Live-lovers."
4,Best album since Throwing Copper,"It was very hard to decide what I liked better. BOP or Distance to Here. In the end I decided that I liked BOP better mainly because of the style. It's a great rock album. People should stop ranting and raving for a Throwing Copper ""part II"". This is the closest there is at the moment."
5,Yes yes YES!,"Right on LIVE! It has been awhile since LIVE came out with a solid whole-way-through album. This is it folks! Nice jamming music, classic Ed voice, great songs with lots of changes in beats during them.I suggest it highly!"
4,Back to basics,"I have been a Live fan since Throwing Copper, to the point that I went back and located all of the CD's that went before it. To me, Throwing Copper is a classic alternative rock album, and is still one of my favorites. In the past few years, they have veered off course -- Distance to Here was not the worst I have listened to, but is was mostly forgettable, and after hearing some of V, I never even bought it. I am happy to say that while Birds of Pray comes nowhere near Copper, it is a solid effort with a number of defining tracks. Live has returned to a more simple delivery, relying on what made them such a success in the first place.I will say that the lyrics don't have the same mysterious quality that used to make Live so much fun -- Ed seems to be a lot happier these days. But this does not distract from a very listenable disc that will please fans of the band, even though it won't totally blow them away."
1,#$$%% Rubbish,"Fake sounding music, crappy lyrics and a singer who once sung with an honest and truthful meaningfull voice now sings in a high pitched wail - this is embarressing, poppy mainstream nonsense is what this album fits easily into.Lives best album is probably ""The Distance to Here"" followed by Secret Samadhi - Live are a much more angry and meaningfull band back then and musically it sounded like they cared about what they were doind - today oviously not.Really this is absolutley terrible. An absolute flop from a once respectable and amazing band."
1,this album is terrible,"this album is definitly my most disapointing purchase all year. they went back to the rock sound, which you would THINK would be good, but they didn't write any good songs this go around. if you've never heard live, try secret samati or V. if you are a live fan, stear clear of this album as well. you'll thank me when you don't waste your 15 bucks."
1,"Heaven Song Is Good, But Album is Poor","I purchased the album in order to get a copy of the song Heaven, which I enjoy very much, but the rest of the album is pretty lousy with some unclassy language and a throw-back 1960s point of view that makes the rediculous argument--even after 911--that there is no legitimate reason to ever go to war. I had hope that these guys had the heads on straight but they let me down with a smattering of songs laced with the type of confused liberalism that is so rampant on college campuses. Save your [money] and treat yourself and a couple of friends to Starbucks."
1,Ughh...,"Please, someone tell these guys to stop. PLEASE. Listen to some Matchbox Twenty if you want some real music...now it's time to jump off the nearest building to rid myself of the horror that is the song ""Heaven"". Just...ugh."
5,Unexpected Greatness From A Band Considered Past Their Prime!,"Upon Live's release of their fifth studio album entitled ""V,"" the seemingly forced and dull effort portrayed a band who lacked potential both musically and lyrically. In comes their sixth studio album, ""Birds Of Pray,"" which was released on May 20, 2003. Unlike its predecessor, ""Birds Of Pray"" is a solid album from start to finish as it successfully showcases big guitars, sweeping anthemic choruses and earnest ballads. There are no ""fillers"" to be found within the 13 tracks that comprise one of the band's most superior albums to date. Below, please find the rating for each song individually:Heaven - 10/10She - 10/10The Sanctity Of Dreams - 9/10Run Away - 9/10Life Marches On - 9/10Like I Do - 9/10Sweet Release - 8/10Everytime I See Your Face - 8/10Lighthouse - 9/10River Town - 10/10Out To Dry - 8/10Bring The People Together - 10/10What Are We Fighting For? - 10/10"
4,Back at last,"I have been a big fan of this band since the mid-nineties and the utter brilliance of Throwing Copper. Having been somewhat disappointed by the albums after that (except The Distance To Here, which I almost listen to daily), I was obviously somewhat carefully optimistic in waiting for the latest offering. I can now report that this my favourite album since Throwing Copper. Lyrics that hit home, accompanied by the kicking rock that we've come to love and expect from Ed and the gang. You will also notice that the ""feel"" of this album is much more uplifting than the last few albums, which I found refreshing. Get this album. The only reason I didn't give 5 is since there are still a few songs (1 or 2) which I don't really love (yet). Perhaps in time I will. (Which was the same on Throwing Copper, and since nobody's perfect, this is pretty darn close for a first-listened-impression.)"
3,"Not great, not bad","Middle-of-the-road, enjoyable renditions of the Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff that unfortunately are also possibly a bit too anonymous. Pleasant as background and warmly recorded, this disc is nice while it's on and then forgotten as soon as it's removed. Still, the way they build the variations in the second movement of the Tchaikovsky is fun. Argerich/Kremer/Miasky are more impassioned, but more than that, they bring more *personality* to the work, and I'd recommend that overall more. (It also has the electricity of being live, but the sonics are excellent and the audience is silent.) As for the work itself, it requires stamina. It's long, and loquacious, as Bruno Walter might say. Sometimes Tchaikovsky, especially in his earlier-to-middle works, let form get away from him. We're nearly approaching Mahler-lengths here, and this is a chamber work. Still, it can be enchanting, if the mood is right and the seat cushions are soft."
2,You get what you pay for!,I loved this bedding set when we first received it. It went so well with the theme of our daughters room. Within a couple of washings the elastic on the sheet broke. We could no longer use the sheet because it wouldn't fit tight on the mattress. We used the quilt on the floor for our daughter to play on. After a couple of months the appliqué on the quilt started coming off. Although this is a cute set I would not recommend purchasing this due to the bad quality.
2,A somewhat ugly story.,"This little pop-up book assumes that the reader knows who the characters are in the ""Thomas the Tank Engine"" series. The pops ups are minimal. The story, however, does not teach a good lesson: laughing at others is all right. Although I'm sure that the story never really is resolved due to the short length of the book, one would think that this popular series would give a more concerted effort towards editing."
2,A B horror movie,A good movie to watch as part of a series of movies. Say like horror night. This would be the opener for a better movie.
5,Great Purchase,Bought this movie for my son who loved the Critters movies. He still goes back and watches this movies with my grandchildren.
4,It is what it is...,"You can look at the cover and know it's not an A-list blockbuster. That being said, for a horror/comedy, I've always thought it was awesome. The aliens are reasonably original (obviously there was a first movie, but you know what I mean), they are cute and cuddly, with lots of teeth and poison darts in their heads; how can you not love them? The characters are reasonably well developed between the two films (they're best watched back to back, though I would skip parts 3 and 4). The special effects, while not stellar, are definately good enough to support the film in the necessary ways. And yes, who can forget the giant ball o' Critters rolling down fleeing citizens and leaving twitching skeletons in its wake (I tend to watch that part five or six times every time I watch this movie). Again, not a deeply fulfilling interpersonal drama, or whatever, but very entertaining, campy alien horror, with enough humor to keep it from being too dark. I definately recommend it."
5,Best in the series!,"Critters 2 is one of my all time favorite movies! Its even better than the first! they just don't make them like they used to! I was a bit suprised that this movie had nudity in it! and on the back of the case it said PG-13 but on the VHS it said PG. but anyways if you haven't seen this movie get off of the computer and go but it! Good luck finding it! i've seen the 1st one and borders on DVD and i bought the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th on VHS at hastings, and found the 1st one at Shopko on VHS for only $3.00! Oh and don't miss out on the critters subtitles! the one where the critter gets his hair blown off is so funny!"
2,Almost worth it,"While I do not have a strong opinion of any of the movies in this series (I watched them for one reason--Terrence Mann), this one was perhaps not the worst. That's the best praise I can give, sorry. High point for me--Ugh's scream. Man, but he has strong vocal chords!"
4,More Critter Action,"I'll have to admit. Critters 2: The Main Course does have more action in it, just not as very good as the original. Still it leaves off where the first Critters ended. I liked it just as good as the first Critters movie."
5,Better than the first.....and more filling.,"This is one of those occassions when the sequel was better than the first. There are way more effects, and the critters this time around have seemed to take on more of a ""gremlin like playful quality"" to them. The giant critter ball, the jumping in the bunny suit, and the whole scene of them at the Hungery Heafer is just classic. Too bad this would not carry over to the next two installments."
2,Not for beginners,I was disappointed in the minimal amount of content for a beginner in applique. More detailed description and pictures showing more steps on techniques would have been helpful. I am hesitant to begin a project with this book alone.
4,Foundation for beginners.,"This book is recommended for beginners. It has plenty of illustration. Super simple designs. Doesn't give to much ideas. Just really simple shapes. A little out dated, since new methods are always surfacing. It's a good bases for foundation and togrow from this point forward."
2,not enough detail,"I have attempted many walks in this guide and have become lost on numerous occasions. There is not enough detail and a lot of the walks are difficult to find on the ground. Ms Wilson would have been better submitting fewer walks and providing more detail for the remainder. In England this would have been less of a problem duw to the fine detail of OS maps. Alas, there are still yet no really decent maps of Crete. Conditions can change literally overnight with shepherd bulldozing their own tracks to mountain pastures and obliterating many old trails. I would not recommend this book to the inexperienced."
4,Colors are beautiful,I put this in my living room. It looks very nice - especially the part that counts - the shade. When it is turned on - it's stunning. The only reason I dropped one star is because I don't really like the little ball thing in the center of the lamp that much. It's a hard translucent piece of orange plastic that covers up a screwed thread - not a deal killer though. The delivery of this lamp took about a week and it came well packaged. Assembly took about 5 minutes - most of which is spent taking it out of the box.
4,It seems to work very well....,"So far I've used this so far on my all weather mats, inside wheel wells and on only semi dirty tires. I don't feel this works very well on overly dirty rubber areas. Nor does it take off all the old dressing on tires.When used on semi dirty tires it leaves the tires with a nice natural look. Overall a good product."
3,It's OK; not much different than 409,I have that brown crap that everyone gets on their tires. 409 does a decent job on it but I was hoping this product would be better. It's roughly the same.
3,Too many glaring misprints,"Too many misprints, and solutions to even numbered problems would make it far more useful. You'd be better off using Mathmatica, Derive, or Maple to check many of the answers."
3,My daughter likes it - I don't,"We checked this software out of the library, thank goodness. I'd be unhappy if we'd spent money on it.My five year old enjoys playing with it but I suspect she will tire of it before it's due back at the library as there is really nothing to do. You can decorate your horse, decorate the show ring, and run around a track. That's about it.There does not seem to be any educational value whatsoever unless you're trying to teach a child how to click a mouse."
4,Cute,"My 4 yo can operate much of this game. I'd rate it more for a 6 yo though... not any older. It's fun to dress up the horses. Not really a learning game, just for fun."
4,Boooooooooooooooring!!!!!,"This is an okay game. Boring. All you do is ride around in a circle, and ""decorate"" your horse. All that means is the sadle and bridle. And who said anything about grooming? If you want to save your money and your pashince, don't get this game."
2,not the best,This is a very bad game because when you ride your horse all you do is jump(a bird chirps when you have to jump)boooring i should have know better to have the pictures fool me. yes they are colorfull and sound fun but trust me there not. this is just a cute game no challeng involved! i only love the part were you pick a horse and decorate her. i am obssesed over horses i guess thats why i bought it. you should get barbie mystery ride. that is a better game. see my review for it!!! you will know its me because my name is melisa.melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa-melisa
3,Okay Book,"Everyone else seems to be astounded and amazed by this book, butit was just okay. The information in this book was very good, but it was presented in a very boring fashion. The only reason I am reading this book is for summer reading, but my mind tends to wonder, and I can not stayed focus, because the book is quite boring. It is great for adults or students doing research on castles in Europe, but is definently not for pleasure reading."
4,Castles 101,"Like the Gies' other works, this book gives a view of the day-to-day life of people in the middle ages for the non-technical reader. In this case, the book's about what it was like to live in a medieval castle. As with their other books, some serious historians will find the book to vague, while many casual readers may find the book to provide too much seemingly trivial detail. For me, it was a great light read, full of fun information. It's also a pretty honest little book. No high prose or deep philosophy here --just the facts. So you want to know what it was like to live in a castle, here are the down and dirty facts. Think of it as Castles 101. Great job!For those interested in a deeper treatment of medieval life, Barbara Tushman's ""Through a Distance Mirror"" is a really great book."
4,What Life in a Castle Hopefully Was Like,"This short book on life in a medieval castle centers around the history of one fortress on the border between England and Wales, and then relates that story to castles across Western Europe. The passages are divided into chapters on all facets of castle life, and are written in a clear, almost ""novel"" like way.Some of the facts presented are well-known, but there were enough fresh tidbits and interesting anecdotes that I never found myself bored.In addition, at the end of the book, is a list of historically important castles, ranging in construction from the 9th century to the 15th century, that can be useful if the reader is planning a trip to England, France, Spain or elsewhere in Europe.All in all, an entertaining and well written book."
3,A Great Resource,Life in a Medieval Castle takes a broad look at all aspects of castle life and their role in the Western European social system between the 11th and 16th centuries. Most of the examples are English and Norman Castles. Overall I'd give this book 3.5 stars and recommend it to anyone interested in a easy general overview of castles and their structural and social evolution throughout the middle ages. For someone more interested in the military and siege aspects of castles this book may not contain as much info as you'd like. I'm keeping this one for my personal collection.
2,my review,"I feel this book was powerful and very sad. I could not put the book down but at the end, I was very depressed. I feel that the book offers a good insight into people who live in third world countries and thetype of problems they have. I felt it was a bit too dramamtic at times."
3,Really a 2.5ish book,"The one great thing about this book is I'm not apathetic about the character. They aggravate me, but I do care in some way, shape or form.The thing is I didn't enjoy reading this book and it wasn't the 'depressing' tale, that doesn't bother me I like bittersweet tales. This book just leaves me with annoyance and dislike for it.I do like however that it's told like life though I don't think the writing is all that great...the tale itself is lifelike."
3,A Karmic Lesson in Suffering,"Nectar in a Sieve is a tale of the courage of the human heart and the indomitable strength of the human spirit. It is a testimony of finding hope in hopelessness and the attempt to savor life's nectar and sweetness before it all inevitably slips away. Set in rural southern India, we meet Rukmani, a simple peasant woman who confronts life's misfortunes and challenges: poverty, disaster and death, with remarkable fortitude and courage. This is not a tale of oppression, machismo, addiction or religion. The Hindu concept of karma teaches us a greater lesson about our protagonist Rukmani. Karma is not about religion but rather is a spiritual or metaphysical philosophy that allows the reader to perhaps reconcile (Rukmani's) life's tragedies and tribulations. Rukmani's path to Nirvana is through severe hardship, and we discover that the meteoric rise of one's character and spirit is indeed through suffering."
4,A sad story,"Rukhmani's story is a sad one that continues to be true in India today. Infant mortality is very high due to poor healthcare and starvation. Women in India have a shorter lifespan then men, Ruku's story shows why all these sad statistics are true.A note about the caste system. It is an inseparable part of India and Hinduism (not a proud part either). One is born into a caste and cannot change it by switching occupations as a previous reviewer has mentioned. The caste system is much more complicated than you're a priest, warrior, merchant or farmer. Being born into a ""low"" caste does not mean one is automatically consigned to drudgery and poverty and being a ""high"" caste does not guarantee wealth. In this book, Ruku is married to a poor man but he is of the same caste as her (intercaste marriage at the time would have guaranteed social ostracization)."
4,An affirmation of personal values,"Something happens to you when you read this book. It seems natural to take a close look into your own life. You imagine how one woman like Rukmani can take on all the suffering day after day, year after year. Rukmani is a woman that you wish you could be more like but fear the result of it. One can not imagine a life like Rukmani without reflecting and wondering... ""What do I have to be unhappy about?"" It is an affirmation that we can learn from others and that what is important in our own lives, is in fact the nectar!"
4,Life is hard and then you die...,"A powerful, yet disturbing novel. A rollercoaster of mostly steep declines. Only an optimist would be a suited reader for this extremely depressing story, filled with dissapointment, deprivity, and death."
3,Nectar In a Sieve,This book was a great experience to learn more about the Indian culture. This book really draws you into the reality of the poor conditions which the citizens of Indian have to indoor and live through. Even to this day it isn't rare to see a poor Indian family in the same condition that Kamala Markandaya lived through. Nectar In a Sieve is a highly recommended book in my part. This really gives you a chance to look at what other people in third world countries indoor each and everyday
2,what else can happen?,some people don't believe in luck but after you read this book you will believe in bad luck. the things our main character goes through becomes to much by the middle of the story for anyone to believe. if you don't like exageration like myself you won't really enjoy this story.
3,"Boring, but a Surprisingly good Ending","The book started of incredibly boring. I thought the author used to much description of Rukmani's struggle. However in the end, I cried from an overwhelming sense of emotion. The author ended the book very well. Although some people feel that seh didn, i think that she brought up important points on how life had been for the poor people in the past in india. Many people may have a misconception of india after reading this book. But this is just a small portion of how life went on for the poor people. It isnt trying to say that india is not a good place to live because this was in the past."
3,The Most Incredible Journey,"Nectar In A Sieve brings you up and down! If you like to read about emotional roller coasters, this is a must for everyone interested."
4,A Review of Nectar in a Sieve,"A somewhat heartwrenching story of a woman's attempt to keep hope alive. This story suffers from a weak plot that seems un-realistic at times. The character development in the story, save the main protagonist, is lacking. Some heavyhanded plot devices seem too easy. However, the story does give a clear idea of life in India with it's hardships."
3,An Eye-Opener that could have been better,"Nectar in a Sieve is about a Indian woman, Rukmani, living in a rural village. The novel depicts Rukmani's ability to survive despite harsh effect of modernization. Firsty, I will start with the good points. Living in a modernized country that has a myriad of luxuries, and the book reveals that in other parts of the world life is not as luxurious. In fact, Rukmani suffers everything from the famines that devastate the family to the loss of her husband.This book had the potential of being one of the greats, but its weak plot line left much to be desired. The plot moved along slowly as expected events such as famine, a stretch of penury, and the death of the husband occured. Most of these were anticipated leaving little excitement or tension in the plot.Over all, this book almost perfectly demonstrates the effects of village life on the characters and gives me a reason to be grateful. However, the plot is a flaw that makes the novel boring at times."
4,Good book,"This was a book that was required for a World Religion class. I ended up enjoying it very much, and I have a much better sense of the culture and people of this region."
5,The prose is lyrical and the sadness poignant.,This is a story of suffering and the ups and downs of life in India. Told through the eyes of an older women who reflects on her life.The story captures the sweetness in the face of a life of poverty and working the land. It gives a real world view of the effects of globalization and the changes that hard working people go through when that change means less resources and demand for their hard work.The prose is lyrical and the sadness poignant. I read this in college in 1984 and the sweetness in this well written book has remained with me.
2,Bad book,"Although I try to appreciate a lot of books that have absolutely no points of interest or a moral, this is without doubt the worst book I have ever read. The books ends tragically (The husband of Rukmani dying), with no reason to end it like that. The book itself has no moral, unless it's this: Don't live in India. I suggest people who want to read this book to find a better book to read."
1,As boring as Bush is stupid,"I was amazed at the extremity of the boredom I was forced to negotiate while attempting to slog through this book for Language Arts. Basically, the plot begins with someone getting married and then having lots of children in India. They go through the process of starving and then dying and then starving over and over again, making stupid decisions and having tragic events happen to them along the way. Because of the obvious pattern it followed, he book became extremely predictable and thus even more boring, which I didn't think was possible.In conclusion, some may contend that Nectar in a Sieve is a 'beautiful masterpiece illustrating the hardships of life in third world countries', but I think it would be better characterized as 'a huge waste of paper. Spend your money on something else."
1,"An agglomeration of boring, plotless drivel.","I had to read this book for school. To put it simply, it was a pain to get through, because just sitting down and thinking was more interesting than reading it.Nectar in a Sieve is about a poor peasant family in India that faces many hardships. Sounds boring? It is. More or less all the action can be summed up by saying, ""they farmed, and sometimes the crops failed, so their daughter had to prostitute herself, then their sons left, then they went to the city because they got evicted from their land, then they went back home and that's the end of the book."" YESSIR THIS BOOK IS BORING!! DONT READ IT!!"
1,bad book,the book is horrible and easy to put down. i was told to read it for school. some of us started and hated it so after all the complaints about how horrible the book is we didn't have to read it and read frankenstien instead.
2,An Experience Without an End,"Reading the novel, ""Nectar in a Sieve"" is an experience, but most likely not the one one would be looking for. Though it is easy reading and somewhat enjoyable, the plot of the story leaves much to be desired. Not only is the end of the novel left dangling without any form of conclusion, but even minor events throughout the story do not possess a sense of completion. The book, however, was very well written with incredible use of figurative language and was, though lacking closure, certainly a fine read."
2,A story about the virtues of persevering... I think not.,"This story kept me believing that at some point the main character would encounter long-lasting success or easy living, but instead I found short bursts of humble happiness and a lifetime of unwinnable battles against nature. A good family falls apart and what seemed to be a strong woman turned out to be a stubborn lady with little knowledge of her surroundings and a difficult lifestyle."
3,Mediocre,"This novel wasn't very great. The characters were forced and the story-line hardly captivating. It was a quick read - fast-paced and could've been structured in a much better way. The themes were clear-cut and frankly, there are better works than this that say the same thing although in a richer fashion.Read Pearl S. Buck's ""THE GOOD EARTH"" instead."
2,way too depressing even for me...........,"Is it just me or does it seem like the author spends a lots of time describing short moments or long stretches of despair in great detail, and glosses over happy bits? I mean, come one, one can only take SO much doom and gloom in one book. This is not an emotional roller coaster, as someone else put it. This is an emotional slide down the stairs-- you drop, level out a bit, drop again, level out again, etc. The whole book is one long whining, ... complaint about Rukmani's hardships. ... Rukmani is the most depressingly INactive character I have ever come across, and I read a LOT. She just sits and lets things happen to her, then moans and ... about it."
1,Point less reading.,This book was given to me as an assignment in school that i had to buy my self.Lets put it this way they should have to pay me to read it. The book is terrible i suggest you don't read.
4,"Basically, a good book",This is a wonderfully written book with many excellent plotlines. The book is very confusing and slow in the beginning. It starts to pick up and gets much better towards the end.
4,A Fatalistic Novel,"It is the time of World War II, and India has just begun to modernize. Rukmani is a poor woman, forced to marry her devoted husband, Nathan, from a lower caste. Through Rukmani's eyes, we see five children grow up in a more or less poverty-striken Indian village. Through drought, monsoons, prostitution, and ultimately, famine, Rukmani shows us all what dignity is. Not only dignity prevails throughout her life, but strength - a strength which comes with much compromise and hardship.-Michael Yang"
1,this was horrible,it was all scratched on the screen the speakers sound is bad and was very unhappy about this product will not purchase from this buyer again
2,Frustrating toy for kids and grownups!,"Our church preschool had a medical cart that the kids loved playing with until it lost its wheels. We ordered this cart as a replacement, but it doesn't live up to our old cart. This cart has only two wheels, so kids need to push down on the handle to lift the back of the cart off the ground before they can push it (this is not easy for a toddler to do). Also, the top of the cart does not stay attached to the bottom...it's difficult for an adult to reattach the top let alone a child. The toys that come with the cart are sturdy and fun to play with, but the cart just doesn't cut it."
3,Depressing part of LDS history - hard movie to watch - not much to lighten the mood,"This movie is actually very well done (for it's budget at least). The problem with the movie is the source material. The time in LDS church history that this covers is a very difficult time. It covers the problems in Kirtland, with the bank, the attempted overthrow of Joseph Smith by Warren Parrish and the gang and some of the Missouri issues as well. The romantic storyline between Joshua and Carolyn was okay but nothing special.If you are looking for a fun movie that will entertain you then this isn't it. However, if you are looking for a movie that can give you some detail about church history during the Kirtland and Missouri eras (minus the Steed fictional characters) then this is a well done movie.This movie desperately needed something to lighten it up... the ending was nice but it wasn't enough."
1,Poor DVD condition,"I was very displeased with the condition of the DVD. I had waited with much anticipation to see this movie only to have the DVD be in very poor condition. It didn't appear like it was scratch but when I was in the second chapter the whole movie was ruined with constant pauses and delayed motion. It didn't better untill the third chapter. Also, I like to have the captions on for my daughter to practice her reading and even the captions were all messed up. I was very disapointed over witht ehquality of the video. I wished I had the sellers address to ask him for a replacement or a refund."
1,No Good,"Barbie Fashion Show will not work with my graphics card even though my card has 32mb memory, I have directX 9, far exceed all the system requirements and have all the latest drivers. Vivendi Universal technical support was of no help either. Beware of the system requirements for this game, even then it still may not work."
3,My little girl,"I bought this game for my little girl. She wanted it because it had Barbie in it. That's how girls are today, they want Barbie everything. Well, I think that Barbie dhould have educational games. I mean, Barbie is a role model all around the world, so I think she needs to teach kids the importance of education. If, parents, your looking for something educational I wouldn't recomend this. However if you want your child to play a fun game with no education then I do recomend this game."
5,This is the Defination of something great!,This game is the coolest it gave me no trouble at all. Buy this you won't be disapointed and its only a click away.
5,Very popular,"This is the 2nd time I've purchased this program for my daughters. They never get tired of it. They are 4, 7, and 10 years old. All of them love it. You create your own fashions for a runway show. You coreograph the moves the models do. You design the stage. There's nothing that compares to this software."
1,Beware Hardware Requirements,"This game requires DirectX 9.0 and video card that supports 3D and 32mb (not 16 as stated above) of video RAM. I've got a Sony VAIO 2.66ghz P4 with all the latest drivers and updates. This system tests out as optimal on all sorts of web sites for evaluating your system. However, this game will not run on this system. Unless you've got a system specifically set up for gaming, I think theres a pretty good chance it won't run on your system. Don't disappoint your little girl with this software. Before buying, install the latest DirectX from the Microsoft website, then go START>Run>dxdiag, then run all the tests. If you don't pass the Direct3D 9 test, don't buy it."
1,Read the Requirements First,"I bought this game for my 5 year old god-daughter, and unfortunatley, it does not work on her computer. We changed the resolution and downloaded the DirectX9.0 and even have the 32MB memory, yet it still didn't work. Make sure you read the system requirements before you buy the product so you won't waste your money on it."
3,It was cool for a little bit..........,"OK, as you read you see the review with the title "" I'm begging my mom for it"". Well, that's me. Now that I have had it for a wile it's boring. After you complete the first 9 taskes you get no more new clothes ( shirts, pants...), fabrics, shoes, and hair styles. I find myself doing the same outfit over and over again. I realy wish i didn't beg my mom for it. Hope I helped!"
5,"My daughter, the fashion designer","My daughters, 11 & 9, love this game. Even though they are not a fan of Barbie, they both really enjoy the ability to create 'new fashions' and then show them off at the 'fashion show.'I highly recommend this game for any girl from 7-14.It is probably the best game I have ever obtained for my pre-teen daughters."
1,Barbie Fashion Show Review,I am unable to provide a review since the game was so outdated it could not be downloaded and the tech support no longer existed! The game was useless and was thrown away just like my money. I believe the seller knew the game was outdated and useless. Shame on you! My child was very upset and disappointed. My lesson...buyer beware of internet sales!
1,Having problems running game,"My daughter received this present from Santa and we cannot get it to work on either of our computers. One computer runs off of Windows XP and the other Windows 98. In calling the tech. support from Vivendi, they mentioned that they never tested this game on laptop computers. I tried this on my desk top and it still didn't work! Would love to know what kind of computers people have that this game actually works!"
1,Buyer beware,Buyer Beware: This product requires PC hardware that is not on typical PC. We found out the hard way. Amazon deducts shipping costs for returns of this kind.
4,Remember those Disney Days,Ha I bought this because I love those disney movies. Very happy and and received it very quick. I willdef order from them in the future.
5,Udderly smooth,I've been using this for years and now can't find in the local market. This purchase was very efficient and received it very quickly.
2,Redex Company not being genuine,"I ordered this ""Udder Cream"" and when I got it, it was not the original formula. The ""Udder Cream"" does not have any water in it, not does it have a large list of ingredients. The original formula had only 4 ingredients and they were all emollients.Im not very happy with this company anymore as they took a great product and are now cheating the customers."
3,not so great,"I've used many moisturizers. I will not buy this one again, it's okay for the price but I would rather spend a little more for better quality."
5,The only one that works for me...,"""Industrial grade,"" as one reviewer put it, is right. This is the only stuff that works for me. If I don't use this regularly during the winter, my hands get so dry & chapped that my knuckles literally crack open and bleed. When I use this stuff regularly, no problem. Note that their foot cream is recommended for diabetic patients because it contains no alcohol. I keep it in both bathrooms at home; I keep it at the office; and I travel with it. Any questions?"
1,very badly written and badly organized,You be better off reading the man file on apache. The author uses inserts from the configuration file of Apache and does not build on it as if the inserts are sufficient explanation for configuring the program. I am insulted. If you still want to buy this book I have mine for sale in the used section for the fraction of the original cost. This book is a waist of time and money.
1,Filled With Errors,"I have a copy of this book sitting on my shelf, left over from a previous sys admin. Every once in a while I pick it up and leaf through it until I find a mistake. It never takes more than 90 seconds. Today I found on page 124 the claim that one can use ""kill -TERM"" instead of ""kill -9"" if one prefers letters to numbers. An author who would make this mistake (-TERM is -15, -9 is -KILL) does not inspire confidence."
3,The title's a little inaccurate...,"While this book does cover the software mentioned in its title, it spends a lot of time with the Apache 1.3 series. In fact, Apache 2.0 was still in beta when the book was published so the author seems a little apprehensive with the material.It is nice as a general overview, and contains a lot of good ""filler"" such as an appendix on common Unix commands and Unix text editors."
4,Great book at a great price!,"Great book, very helpful, I use it often, it has helped me discover and resolve many issues, Amazon had the best price by far and I Highly recommend this book and recommend you buy it form Amazon."
1,"Truly not for ""beginners""","Look inside this book, it is chock full of complex computer jargon. Poorly organized book."
1,Too much in too little space,"I am a systems administrator trying to set up Apache running on a network.I have been trying hard to cope with this book for simple installation and configuration procedures but in vain.After desperate efforts, i picked up the kate wrightson book and i got everything set up in a snap (actually 3 days of fruitful reading).Thumbs down to the Professional Apache 2.0 book fortrying to cover too much in too little space."
2,Nudes...if you can find them...,"In the 500 plus pages of this book there are a dozen good nudes, possibly twenty. The rest of the photos are poor quality shots, with plenty of fig leafing, Shadows, poor lighting, and shots supposedly getting erotic by covering up the models. If the reader wants to see what's in the book, borrow it from a library and order a much better nude photo album, like 100 naked girls, or Crazy Sexy Girls, or Shaven Angels."
3,for all Kingdome19 fans,You find in that book previously unreleased worksby the great german photographer / photographist Kingdome19.The content with male models are sadly a little bit low.Together a book with hundreds of nudes . female & male
1,Sony users - don't buy!,As cute as this device is why buy a cable that can only charge your phone when you cna get a cable that will charge your phone AND synch with your PC for less money? For the Sony T610 look for a cbale called the dcu-11. {...}
5,Great Historical Drama,This is one of the most popular Korean Historical Dramas. I would recommend this to every American/Asian couple. This has all the drama a love a woman would want and it has plenty of battle scenes any guy would like. For all those American/Asian couples out there she can watch in Korean and the English subtitles are great. I understand a little Korean so I'm completely informed as to what is going on in the show. I bought all four volumes.
1,Thank God for David Mills,"Whew! It's a good thing David Mills has set us all straight about everything from the police, to chiropractors, to schools, to God. My question is, why did he feel the need to write this book? It reads like a teenager going through their rebellious stage."
1,Severely Disappointed,"I am thankful that Mr. Mills does not classify himself as an expert. His views, while seemingly unique, fall in line with what he seems to like to avoid, conformity. Only his conformity is not to a fundamentalist regime, but to an untra beyond liberal regime instead. I am highly dissappointed that a father could relay such pessimism and unrealism to the world (or at least the small one that reads this book) and lead a child into beliefs that will lead her hopeless. While many atheists have non-religious morality, Mr. Mills apparently needs to grow in this area. His proud writing leaves much to be desired. I am highly disappointed that I wasted my time reading this book- thankfully, I did it for free on his website."
2,Movie with Cool Tech Stuff,"Tim Robbins what were you thinking? The plot was mediocre at best and all the characters are not at all representative of those working at a true computer corporation. No one that looks like Rachel Leigh Cook or Ryan Phillippe and works with computers. Those actors are best suited for the teen drama or love or whatever movies, one of them would be alright, but all of them being a bunch of pretty teens? Not really plausible.This movie is a little too straightfoward and but the ending oh thats the killer! This movie is way too outrageous, but its filled with colorful sets and a bunch of geeks having fun in the office. Since I am a geek, I'll give this two stars instead of just one."
3,one of Phillippe's best,"i'm not a big fan of Ryan Phillippe, but he was really good in this role as a computer geek who gets a shot at working for this guy who he and his friend don't like. Tim Robbins enters him into his world of money making and designing software that can change the future and then something happens, his best friend gets murdered. Could it be Robbins? or someone else who hired the hit on his friend. Then he goes threw all these hoops and jumps threw him in order to seek the truth. Can his girlfriend be in the mix too, as well as all of everybody in the whole bulding. Phillippe turns to Racheal Leigh Cook and they try to figure out whats going on, but is Cook really who she says she is or is she working for Robbins as well. Entertaining from start to finish. Never lets go. A sort of creepy geeky bad guy performance by Robbins and a good paranoid performance by Phillippe. 3 stars"
3,"Story good, Acting good, Suspense bad.","Antitrust stars Ryan Phillippe, Rachael Leigh Cook, Claire Forlani and Timn Robins. The story is good. And the acting is good too. So whats wrong with this movie. Well, for a suspense movie it just does not work. this movie is about Milo (Ryan) lands a job and a computer company. tim Robbins is just like a Bill Gates. He is going to intoduce a service that can aloow people to see friends, family and just about everyone on any device. Labtop, Cell Phone, Email ECT.... Then his best friends Teddy is murdered. He then starts getting suspicious that Tim might have something to with his friends death. Like I said that movie is good and so is the acting. But there is just no suspense! On my scale from 0-10 Antitrust is a Fascinating, Techno, slow pacing 5."
3,Not a major classic but Worth a look,"I'd hardly call this a contender for one of the best pictures of the year, but if you don't let your expectations rise too high, watching it might be time well spent. It's a quirkily offbeat little movie that, after a perhaps slow start, develops twists and turns that keep you watching and should make you glad you hung with it. There's not much more I'd be inclined to say that wouldn't get into the realm of spoilers, so I won't go there. But watch it, and I wouldn't be surprised if you find you've seen much duller movies."
3,Something in the middle of The NET and Hackers,"This movie can be the best movie in the past computer related movies like Wargames, The NET and Hackers. Ryan Phillippe's performance is good. And don't expect 5 star for these movies because these are computer related thriller movies. You can't see special effects and that makes the movie bad for many people."
5,Great Movie,I am 16 years old and I am very much into computers. Now anyone who likes computers I recommend this movie because this is one of the best movies I have ever seen dealing with computers. With the exception of the 1985 movie Hackers. Also another great movie. So I suggest you buy this movie.
3,A good geek flick,"Being a techie myself, I thought this movie kept my attention long enough to keep the unrealistic plot where it belonged - behind the nerdy stuff. The acting was so-so but what do you expect from Hollywood actors trying to be something they aren't? Tim Robbins was very plastic and inconsistent; the plot twists were fairly predictable and the attempts at humor didn't work very well. Otherwise, I really enjoyed watching the gadgetry and *real* programming screenshots. For once, Hollywood didn't fabricate stupid looking futuristic computer screens and peripherals. I also have a better appreciation for the open source community than before. Nothing against Microsoft, though, because MS is an American company (read capitalistic) from the ground up and has earned money the American way. I love the line, ""All it takes is some kid in a garage to knock down N.U.R.V..."" (paraphrased) Ah, the American dream lives!!"
3,Nice little enjoyable film,AntiTrust is a film that all cyber geeks can relate to. The film stared a then up and coming Ryan Phillpee as Milo a computer hacker who goes to work for a company that isn't what it seems. The film is fast paced and one of my favorite actors Tim Robbins makes a great villian.
3,"Suspenseful Yes...Believable, Not Really","It's doubtful the folks at Microsoft would look at Peter Yates' ""Antitrust"" with wild glee. Not would they add this overblown yet entertaining DVD to their film collection. In the film, baby-faced Ryan Phillipe plays a computer genius/ Stanford grad who's developed an Internet Start Up program. Soon after the film opens, his character finds work at NURV, a giant software company headed by power hungry Tim Robbins. Before long, computer geeks are being murdered causing Phillipe to sneak about the company looking for clues that link NURV to the murders. What follows is good, clean, suspenseful fun, the kind Hollywood film studios are famous for. You have to stretch your imagination every five or ten minutes. Otherwise, you'll just sit there thinking ""God, I hate this movie. God, I hate this movie."" Phillippe plays his nerdy character intensely. It's his best work to date. But considering the umpteenth flops he's starred in, this isn't necessarily a compliment."
2,Movie Gone Bad............,"I thought this movie might have had a lot of promise, but it just didnt present. It was not only a little bit predictable, but just plain boring. It didnt have much of a plot, and really the characters were completely non-likable. Not what I would call an A+ movie. Im sure there are other movies that might be more to your taste."
1,All fouled up,"Nothing works in this film.Not the story (even disbelief won't do)....Not the actors---Phillippe Baby doesn't KNOW what acting is (he's beyond bad....)Released in 2001, so filmed before the 2000 dot.com bust --- maybe that's why we had the BUST.Not worth the electricity necessary to power the TV set."
4,Good and Evil in the computer industry,"I'm sure you're all fimiliar with the story line from other reviews, so I'll skip it, and go right into the issues.The acting is superb, mainly because the actors and actresses are good ones. The stroy line is loosely based on events of the past few years in the computer industry. All this is great. But when the movie tries to protray the argument between the 'open source' / high priced software, the 'open source' good guys win. But somehow the 'high priced' software guys made a better case - putting some of the earnings back into development sounds a lot better than the 'knowledge belongs to mankind' ideology of the open source camp in the movie..."
3,"""it's a fine line between stupid and clever"" - spinal tap","I don't know whether this movie is a pathetic and foolish attempt to attack Bill Gates, or a brilliant mockery of those who attack him. Most likely the former.Either way, it's fun to see Tim Robbins as a totally evil parody of the software mogul. Good for many laughs, especially if you're in this industry. For those who aren't, this movie is just another typical high-tech suspense movie, with very little substance or style. Good for a rainy night rental when the movie you really wanted to see is sold out."
2,Rent the real-deal instead,"The only reason to watch this film is to see Tim Robbins as a dead-ringer for Bill Gates. It sure as heck isn't to see Ryan Philippe. I watched one of the featurettes and laughed because of how proud the filmmakers were that they bothered to use real code in the split-second scenes where you see the screen as the characters type furiously. Who cares?If you want to see what the war to find the next great techno-innovation was really like, watch ""Pirates of Silicon Valley. This docu-drama concerns the very real industrial espionage on all sides that went into creating the first PCs. Bill Gates does the most and of course comes out on top. It's everything ""Anti-trust"" wishes to be, and without the preposterous murders."
3,I like it!,"Okay it's not Oscar material but it's a nice thriller to watch on a Saturday afternoon. Computer freaks and even non freaks will like it. It's not over your head material and the basic story is greed. In this case someone is killing people to get to the top of the heap. Of course if the killer can get you to work for him then you have a chance of staying alive. Gary Winston (Tim Robbins) is trying to build a global network but his genius comes at a high price.Like I said, it's not Oscar material. This film may take itself too seriously at times but it's okay."
3,"Fun, but like a parody","This is some fun entertainment, but really more of a comedic parody of hacking and CEOs who run software companies. It's good for a laugh or two, but nothing super dramatic or anything to be taken seriously."
3,Deleted,"An average movie with the same old plot of the big evil corporate thing... seems the only ones who complain about microsoft and such are the ones that were not good enough to work there in the first place, but i don't see the poeple who do all of the complaining about evil corporations offering thier paychecks to the poor people who got kicked to the curb, nope instead they buy more pc's and such made by big evil companies and then tell each other some bleading heart story on how this will benifit those who got trampled on to make themselves feel better about the bs they spew from thier mouths every day. enough though the movie is entertaining but predictable."
4,Great movie,The is a very good movie. I was suprised by how well it was. I found it not predictable. Seems like movies lately...you can figure out what is going to happen before it happpens. You should get this one. You will really enjoy it.
4,"Entertaining, Conspiracy Thriller","Ryan Phillippe and Tim Robbins star in this technological conspiracy thriller that seems to eerily touch close to home with todays events. A Bill Gates type computer genius (Robbins) with a company that has dominated the software market, NERVE, is being pressured by the U.S department of justice on anti-trust laws. The company now seeks new employees, new employees with the skill and creative instinct to put out its new communications software to make millions. Phillippes is a computer geek that works in his garage and gets hired to join the company, but soon finds out its darker motive. A good film, exciting, beleivable."
1,How does anyone find this good?,"Phillipe is the worst actor ever, he shows no emotion whatsoever. And the reviewer who says it is a ""veiled"" shot at Microsoft might want to read the paper a little more. The entire movie is a shot at Microsoft. Rachel Leigh Cook has ten lines, so how can you say she is a great actress? This movie is poorly written, poorly acted, and if that wasnt bad enough, very poorly directed. If you really want to see it, wait till it is on HBO and waste two hours, like I did."
1,It's Note fair to cvall thisz a movie!,stupid descrribes this movie. it's awful. 9i hated this movie. why does everyone like it? whatz everyone getting out of this mnovie that i doesn't? the acting is bad the directoing stinks. the story is tooo predictabelt and pointless. thisz isn't even a movie in the rwl sense opf the word. it's jink. and i don't think peorle should rebnt or dare even buy this junk.....peace
1,Worst Movie Ever,"One of the worst movies ever to hit the screen. The charecters are completely and utterly ridicolous, and the script should have been burned. The actors fared off ok but its still utterly unbelieveable. Of all the Tech based movies out there, this is just utterly bad. A clasic example of Bill Gates but who wants to watch that. If I want to see a Bill Gates strugle I would rather go with the clasic between Gates and Jobbs. This movie is not worth the rent or buy. Unless you know nothing about technology and the workings of its industry, you should stay far far away from this one."
2,Trust your instincts on this one,"Antitrust defines the word typical very well. It has ""B"" movie written all over it. When I thought I'd rent Antitrust, I knew I was taking a chance. Everything was so formulaic. The acting, which was poor, hurt the movie a lot. Ryan Phillippe is a good actor, but he doesn't have the stuff to carry a movie all by himself. I was highly disappointed in the quality of Tim Robbins acting. It has seemed his film career has really taken off lately, but it takes a step back with the making of Antitrust. The directing was OK, but nothing to brag about. But I did think Milo (Phillippe) figured everything out way to quickly. And the bad guy/good guy was easy to figure out. Everything was so predictable. The music choices for the film were terrible. Putting Alternative/Pop music into a movie automatically makes me take the movie less seriously. I now know why Antitrust was on the bottom shelf at Blockbuster. 2 Stars"
2,Hacker Hooey,"This was a paycheck movie if ever there was one. Why else would Tim Robbins do a film like this? Inept, predictable connect-the-dots plotting keeps you in anything but suspense. A few nice moments and some great interiors along the way, otherwise the script, direction, and acting are e-mailed in. Cyber-subversion for ciphers."
3,surprisingly good,"i don't really see ryan phillippe as a boy-genius, but the movie is pretty good. while this won't win any awards, an overall good story."
5,phenomenal woman,"Phenomenal Woman is an AMAZING poem that has touched so many females, showing that it is not whats on the outside that counts. showing that you dont have to be pretty or skinny to be phenomenal. this poem is one of my favorites because it made me stop worrying about what people think of me. i love this poem because when i am feeling ugly or fat i can read this poem and it will make me feel so much better."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,I had heard this CD in my lamaze class and loved it. I found it on Amazon and it helped me tremendously. I had a beautiful natural childbirth. It was my first baby and my mom who has had six of us said it was the most peaceful amazing birth she's ever seen. She said I did better than she did on ANY of her deliveries. The Lamaze class and breathing techniques also helped during the contractions but the CD really helped me especially with sleeping between contractions. I used it to fall asleep to for a couple weeks before the baby was born so when I used it during delivery it made me go right back to that state of mind.
2,Too New Age,"I bought a few different relaxation CDs to compliment my hypnobirthing class but I found this one to be the most new age type quackery. I have strong Christian principles and I value the philosophy of hypnobirthing without making it into a ""we are our own God"" type philosophy like this author."
2,Oh dear...I'm so picky,I'm sure this is a good CD for lots of people. But as I'm not familiar with American voices it was not relaxing for me.
1,Do Not Purchase,Dixie Carb Counters Dine 'n Dash Cream of Mushroom Soup Mix is not a cream of mushroom soup at all. It's vey watery and the taste isn't good at all. I do not recommend this product for low carb dieters.
3,Low Carb Cream of Mushroom Soup,"It taste like mushroom soup, it will take the edge off of hunger. I con't care for it much because I don't like mushrooms, but, it does what it is suppose to do, and what we don't do to watch our weight. I think low carbs are over priced, but, they are well packaged and kitchens have put in a lot of work and expense to help people watch their weight. So, I just buy the products and keep on trucking."
5,Amazing,"Professor Shambaugh's introduction to the Chinese military is an easy to read book full of important detail and predictions. Few books out there provide a full overview of the PLA including topics such as civil-military relations, and PLA budget. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the Chinese military or East Asian security."
5,"Fun book, especiall for the adult with an inner child they would like to reconnect with.",This book has an uncanny way of bringing you back to your fondest childhood memories. You'll enjoy it as much as your teenage son or daughter will.
1,The worst camera!,"DO NOT BUY!!! Against my recommendation, my six-year old daughter bought this camera from Wal-Mart with her allowance. The LCD screen is so horrible that you can barely tell what you just took a picture of. There is no optical or digital zoom, so you have to move to get the picture, and I swear there is no focus or image stabilization on this camera, because when we downloaded them to the computer, all 50 or so pictures she took were blurry. This is worse than my cell phone camera--probably the worst camera you can buy."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$ - It's a piece of JUNK!,"Do not buy this camera! It is a piece of complete and utterly worthless JUNK. I bought it for my 7-year old for Christmas. The quality of the pictures it takes (that is, when it is actually working correctly, which was RARE!) is simply awful! The pictures are so horribly grainy that you cannot even discern who is in the image. It seemed like a great deal and a good price for an inexpensive camera for a kid - but when you see how awful the pictures are, you will realize you've been totally ripped off if you have purchased this!It's really such a terrible product, I don't even know how they get by selling it at all. I wanted to give it NO STARS but the system does not allow that, I guess. The 1 star I am giving it is far too generous!"
1,Do Not Buy,"This is the third of these ""Sakar"" cameras gifted to my kids. They are all junk! Pictures are extra poor, usability is not good, and battery life is bad. It shouldn't be called a camera and can barely be classified as a ""toy"". This company should be ashamed of such poor product development.Do not waste your money."
1,Pure crap,"This camera is a complete waste of money. It is garbage. It should be considered a mere toy. The picture quality is unbelievably bad- dark, grainy pictures. I am hugely disappointed in it!"
2,You get what you pay for,"For the cheapest digital camera I could find on Amazon, that's exactly what I got. Great for a little kid, terrible if you have some practical use for it. My phone takes better pictures. However, if you need a cheap digital camera in a hurry, this on will work."
1,Dreadful,"I could not agree more with the other reviewers. I purchased this a short time ago (not from Amazon, otherwise I could have used these helpful reviews) and I'm so sorry I did. The pictures are fuzzy, the manual is worthless, with precious little information. Forget about the video function - that's even fuzzier and grainier than the ""photos"" you'll take with this deplorable waste of plastic. This is a pathetic camera at any price. Digital Concepts should be ashamed to have a product like this on the market."
1,BAd Buy,"Its basically a mini camera you can get for less at walmart,not to mention how blurry and distorted the photo's turn out.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!"
4,Great album,"""Citrus District"" and ""Picture Book"" are classic, you gotta love these songs. Great production, great vibe, he really takes you somewhere with these songs. ""Viles"" displays some sick styling and chopping by Myka and Freestyle Fellowship member PEACE, definitely the hardest rapping on the entire album by far, pure heat for rap purists.I think ""Soiree"" might be a bonus track -- it was on the ""Citrus Sessions"" EP that was released in advance -- and it's got a great party vibe and definitely should have been released as part of the album. Not to be missed.I've heard this described as ""hip hop for grown-ups,"" and he definitely tackles some serious issues like visiting his daughter (another great track -- ""Alive Again""), the destruction of the environment, the constant need to work to get ahead, breaking up with your girl, love, dealing with anger, etc. There's also the obligatory pot song.It's a mixed bag, but there are some serious gems on this album that you shouldn't sleep on.peace"
2,Dissapointingly dull...,"I was very dissapointed with this book. I have read many Christie books and Usually I find them outstanding. I was surprised at how dull this book seemed. You might want to read it if you have read some books by Christie before, but don't read this if this is the first. There are many more that are much better!"
1,The Worst She Ever Wrote?,"This book, if not Christie's worst, is definitely in the running for that dubious honor. The characters (other than the two sleuths) were uniformly unlikeable, even repulsive. And those were the characters we were supposed to like! The pace was glacial, the dialog uninspired. Even the usually amusing Ariadne Oliver was more idiotic than entertaining here. I skimmed and skipped to get to the end. I will admit the business with the portraits was interesting--a tidbit of the Christie genius otherwise not in evidence in this novel."
3,A slow read,"Most of Agath Christie's works are fast paced and suspenseful. In contrast, Third Girl made me want to put it down and count how many pages till the end!The thing that bored me about Third Girl was how the older characters in it kept saying things like ""teenagers these days."" This book was written in the 60s, and that's when most of Agatha Christie's worst books were written.The plot was ok, but makes you think you have the answer so you might stop reading it in the middle. The ending was really good, but the middle kept repeating the same clues over and over.If you are planning to sit down for a couple hours and read a book, I guess you could read Third Girl. But if you are busy, you won't be able to finish it."
1,Ugh!,"This is awful! It did not have a very interesting plot! It could not hold my attention! Agatha Christie's books usually have a special feel to them (only the good ones do!) it had a slow beginning, but often Agatha's somtimes do that. Here's a tip for future referance, keep trying if other Agatha's books start out slow. Most are good, but have slow beginnings."
3,Third Girl--Three Stars,"This novel, written in the 60s, is not, in my opinion, one of her best. The three stars, however, is a Christie rating. It is still better than a lot of modern mysteries out there. My main problem was the vagueness at the beginning of the book, which led to temporary confusion as to who the third girl actually was. The writer Ariadne Oliver is also a vague character (and annoying). Christie does a valiant job trying to reflect the Beatnik era and obviously did her homework on the drugs du jour. Still, the overall work lacks coherence. Like Poirot, I was well and truly stumped (much time is given to the detective's mental processes). When the ins and outs of the mystery were finally revealed, much of it seemed far-fetched. I much preferredSleeping Murder, a Miss Marple mystery, andThey Came to Baghdad."
3,M. Poirot takes on the 1960s,"I had forgotten that Hercule Poirot was solving crimes way past the between-the-wars golden age of detective fiction. Third Girl is set in swinging London of the mid-sixties - think Twiggy, Carnaby Street, etc.. The detective and the author are equally bemused by the changes in society. Hercule Poirot was eccentric back in the day, but in the 60s, with his giant waxed moustache, he's outlandish. When the Third Girl of the title looks up M. Poirot, she blurts out ""You're too old!"" and takes off.Poirot, of course, prevails with the help of his friend the mystery writer Ariadne Oliver, and an extensive Rolodex including people who have more of a grip on modern problems. Still, the problems of murder are timeless and I certainly never guessed ""who done it"" although I at least picked up some of the clues.If you love a classic murder mystery and want to sample a 60's period piece, you will enjoy Third Girl."
3,Not as 'cozy' as her other books...,"I have mixed feelings about this book. The plot was pretty complex and hard to figure out, and I was surprised by the ending, all of which I love. I enjoy most Christie novels because they are ""cozy"" mysteries. However, this one was not so cozy. Usually the people in her books act very differently from people today. They act like ladies and gentlemen, with old fashioned manners and style of dress, and are concerned about things like honor and reputation. This novel dealt with young people doing drugs, having affairs, and dressing in the grunge style, and there was a bit of espionage. So while it was entertaining, it was not much of an escape for me."
5,An absolute must-have for Agatha Christie's many devotees,"Third Girl: A Hercule Poirot Mystery is the unabridged audiobook adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's classic mystery novels. Three single girls are roommates in London; one is a secretary, one is an artist, and the third - who seeks help from Poirot - disappears, convinced that she is a murderer. Poirot finds and ocean of malign rumors, but uncovering hard evidence to determine whether the third girl is truthful, false, or deluded will take all his skill and determination. A gripping story of intrigue all the way through, skillfully narrated by Hugh Fraser (who played Captain Hastings, Poirot's assistant in the television adaptation of Poirot's mysteries broadcasted by A&E and PBS), Third Girl is an absolute must-have for Agatha Christie's many devotees. 6 CDs, 7 hours."
3,If you are looking for your first Christie DON'T start here!,"To say that this is not Dame Agatha's best is an understatement. If you are a Christie fan (particularly of Ariadne Oliver) you'll probably want to read this one, otherwise look elsewhere.The story opens as Poirot has just sent his book to the publishers a young woman arrives seeking his detective services but decides that he is ""too old"". Poirot manages to overcome his shock and elicits a few details from her before she leaves. Then Poirot goes to visit his friend author Ariadne Oliver for sympathy and information. The two sleuths then collaborate to solve the crime.In typical Christie fashion there are long hidden secrets that finally revealed, all are not as they seem, all clues are fairly laid out for the reader to follow and of course there is a surprise at the end. On the plus side of this otherwise mediocre novel Ariadne Oliver is delightful."
3,A slightly different Poirot adventure.,"Third Girl is an experimental effort by Agatha Christie. Of course, it's still very much a whodunnit, but the style of writing is more youthful than most of her other works. I guess it's Christie's way of portraying the hippie era. Despite the more ""bouncy"" approach, at times this book is difficult to read because the paragraphs seem to ramble on. Some paragraphs even spanned a page, which is quite frustrating. Still, it's a nice little mystery that should provide an interesting challenge for her fans, even though I guessed the outcome halfway through it - the clues are just too obvious. Overall, not the best of Christie's work. I'll recommend it for the completist, as in, fans who want to read every one of Hercule Poirot's adventures."
3,Standard,"No surprises in the script, but the acting is really good. I caught this one late at night on TV at the begining and stayed awake to watch it through. Rent before you buy; it's worth the money to rent & see it at least, but I'm not sure you'll want to pay to keep it unless you're a huge fan of someone in the movie."
3,Is something fishy?,"Like daverack, I ordered this book last year and still have not received it. Kinda makes me wonder how the other reviewers were able to get hold of copies to read and review.Based on ""another book experience"", we need to wait for this one to really be about Application Express 2.0, rather than HTML DB 1.6, but the waiting is definitely getting old."
5,Worth the Wait!,"Immediately after reading this book, I began working with applications developed in an Oracle Application Express environment. The technical content and examples in the book provided me with the tools that I needed.The examples are progressive, so the novice OAE user can effectively practice their new skills! It's a true jumpstart!"
1,I cannot download book scripts.,"I bought the book. It says, goto rampant.cc/html_db.htm, and download scripts.I do that, and a screen comes that asks the username and the password. Which username, which password? I did not get any usernames with the book. I had to sign up on rampant.cc site. But i still can not pass this silly rampant.cc/html_db.htm page.This is the first time i saw the book scripts zone is passworded.Congratulations rampant, i could not download the scripts. What a clever idea to password the scripts zone!!!"
2,Not the best effort,"A sticker claimed they released ""Online Pharmacy"" as a single, complete with video, which is on youtube. I was a bit skeptical, but after listening to the whole CD, it was essentially the best song on there. The title is amazingly descriptive, as the whole CD is pretty gruff, punkish, and raw in sound. If you see ""Tom Hingley"" on the cover, and start thinking of his voice singing in Inspiral Carpets, you'll be very disappointed. Same thing if you looked at the cover and noticed the band is called ""the Lovers."" Not really what you would expect.The rest of the band took time off from their gigs in the London Symphony to play on the CD, as a favor."
3,Cute but flimsy,It's a good thing I bought this for a table decoration and not to use on a daily basis. I love the telescoping arms and how you can arrange them however you want. But one of my arms would never stay up...it just kept flopping over to the side. I tried tightening the screw that held the arm in place but it did nothing. I ended up super gluing it in place which means it can never be rearranged.
2,"Cute display, but came broken","We purchased 3 stands to hold the cards. The clip part and the arms themselves are very very delicate. One of them came broken. I tried to email in and see how to exchange or return them, but haven't gotten a response and it's been a couple weeks already. So, I definitely wouldn't recommend this item or vendor."
2,Some broke,I ordered a bunch of these for my MIL's surprise birthday party and the arms would break off or flop over so that the pictures would't stay up.
2,broke,"Broke chritmas morning! Very disapointd with the quality of the itiem. Was fr m 16 year old daughter,to hold GC and broke rigt off!!"
1,Cheap & Poor Quality,I received these but was not happy with the quality. One had a clip completely broken off and three other clips bent in various positions. My husband fixed them but they should have arrived in perfect condition not in unusable condition!
1,Poor quality,"This item was of poor quality. One of the alligator clips had been bent and it broke off within a day. Several of the others were not attached securely and came off when trying to clip in items. I ordered this for Christmas and unfortunately waited until the last minute to take it out of the box, or I would have sent it back. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Big Momma's House 1&2,This film is very funny as only these films can be as the characters are real life. Actors and directing provide Colorful background.
3,"Fair books, dated on subjects and free at DTIC","A fair set of books, but dated because of breakthroughs in FPA's and remote sensing technology. All eight volumes are free for downloading from DTIC in PDF format."
5,An essential resource for anyone working with IR optics,"Although the price of the set may seem steep, it is well worth it for any engineer working with infrared optics given the amount of time it will save. All the chapters are written by various contributing authors, but all seem fairly well written and carefully edited. The focus is on military applications of infrared optics, which is the field I work in at the US Army Research Laboratory, but those dealing with environmental remote sensing and other fields may also find it quite useful. The amount of detail about military infrared target acquisition, surveillance, and countermeasure systems is incredible and the authors are respected authorities in the military research and development community."
1,INCORRECT DESCRIPTION - NO BATTERY BOX INCLUDED,"When you view the technical details for this product, it indicates that a Battery Box is included with the Mic, even shows the weight of the battery box that's supposed to come in the mic.This information is INCORRECT. The battery box only comes with the more expensive models, NOT this one.Please make sure NOT to buy this product unless you have a source that can power this mic, because without the battery box or a source that can power it, the mic is useless."
4,Great Lavalier Mic,"I use this mic with a wireless system and it has very good clarity and is very hot, it will pick up loud noises from a distance of about 40 ft., so I turn down my mic recording level to eliminate that problem. My only complaint is the mic clip that came with the unit will not hold the mic, it pops out of the clip without fail. I would think Sony would send a mic clip with the product that is engineered to work with the product it is packaged with. That is the reason for a four star rating. As far as quality goes it is a five star product. I use a wire adjustable clip and it works just fine."
5,Excellent Value,The mic performs well in a meeting/classroom environment. No problems. Amazon shipped very quickly and had the best price I could find.
4,"Every choice seems reasonable, but ...","Every choice seems fairly reasonable (if not necessarily honorable) at the time but things spin slowly farther and farther out of control. Justly compared to the Cohen Brothers' thrillers. I'll be on the lookout for the Edgerton brothers' next film. The short film ""Spider"" which precedes ""The Square"" is a pretty near perfect short; a little morality fable about the unintended consequences of a practical joke."
1,Boring,The twist to this plot . . . for 5 seconds made this movie interesting. Besides that it was just boring. It was as if I had seen this movie in several other movies.
4,Really good movie,"Just got don't watching this movie and for the person who put a bad review forget him this is a good movie. It's not perdictable, has great acting and has a great story. Simple rent it or buy it just be sure not miss this one."
1,Do NOT Buy THIS!!,"Just as everyone else below mentioned Amazon ripped us off! Today I had 3 giant boxes on my door step only to find that two of the boxes contained one single plate each and the other box had two bowls and two small plates. That is pretty expensive for the $100+ I spent for 2 plates, 2 bowls, 2 salad plates. Trying to resolve the problem. First time I have been taken by Amazon, I thought they were above this..."
3,"Great idea, but dry","This book is a great idea with an appealing format, but the author, although purporting to write for lay-people, writes like a scholar. The prose is dry and turgid; interesting stories are rare in the book. _Christian History Made Easy_ by Timothy Jones covers all of the same data as this book in a way that lay-people can appreciate."
4,Exploring Church History,This book is an excellent introductory tool for studying church history. The chapters are short and precise but leaves the reader with loads of information to help with further studies.
1,sadly disappointed,"I was looking forward to receiving this product. After receiving I hurried up & open right away only to be very disappointed. It was absolutely hideous! The faded pictures couldn't be made out, the colors are not the same as the picture provided. I wouldn't even use it as a rug for muddy feet. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Very sad it wasn't what was expected or perceived To be in picture."
1,Image looks way better then it is...,"I was hoping that the opposite would be true (or even if the image looked like the blanket). But unfortunately, the image is very light (in fact, i had trouble figuring out which side was up since neither side looked very good). I had high hopes for a nice egyptian throw, but it didn't come true...The blanket itself is still ok though. It feels somewhat comfortable, and my dog doesn't seem to mind laying on it...When i get home i may try to take a picture and upload it so people can see what it really looks like."
3,"review on actual book received, not product in general","the textbook is fine and the cases are interesting. my professor doesn't exactly teach according to this book, she includes a lot of her own lessons/ commentary.however, i do want to say i was very disappointed in the condition of the book i received. it was supposedly in ""very good condition."" but when i got it, the binding was completely in shambles. there was more highlighting/ writing than i expected and the book cover itself was dirty w/ weird markings. yah, i get it was used...but if you're going to say it's in ""very good"" condition, make sure the hardbound cover is attached to the pages of the book at least! that was the most annoying part. but b/c it was so cheap, i'm dealing."
1,Waste of Time and money,"This book is the worst. That said, i did not have to use any other torts book in my first year of law school so there is a possibility that they are all this terrible. Frankly, i think we just used this book because my professor is too lazy to learn another one. We hardly even used it towards the end of the year because it lacked relevant cases. Also, a significant portion of the cases contained within are antique British case law AKA the worst. I feel for anyone who is required to use this book. I suggest buying some supplemental material because this thing is not going to teach you torts. There is a reason used copies are so cheap."
3,It's a case book...,"It's a case book. I looks like a case book, smells like a case book and most importantly, it reads like a case book. Get the point?"
4,What can I say? It's Doyle!,"Now most Sherlockians would say this is not Holmes at his best, and at times I would agree (hence only 4 stars) but some of my personal faves are in here. In order, the stories are: 1)""Wisteria Lodge"" 2) ""Cardboard Box"" 3) ""Red Circle"" 4) ""Bruce-Partington Plans"" 5) ""Dying Detective"" 6) ""Lady Frances Carfax"" 7) ""Devil's Foot"" 8) ""His Last Bow"" In particular, I like ""B-P Plans,"" ""Dying Detective,"" and ""Devil's Foot."" These are some of the more obscure cases. Definately try this book, especially if you're read ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" already."
4,Nice read- I love Lucy,This is a good book- showing Lucy- its a little sad at times- but it very nice to be at home with Lucy!Check it out and see how you like it!
2,look at *ME*--I'm with Lucy!,"I confess to not reading the entire book.I really didn't want to.The tone was rather gushy and breathless. The photos of author and actress seemed to usually show him smirking into the camera, draped around her, as if broadcasting ""here *I* am with a STAR!""One didn't get the impression of the author as a friend, but as someone more needy. His likening Ms. Ball and himself to the main characters in ""Sunset Boulevard"" was therefore strange. He seemed to never forget--or let the reader forget either--that Lucy had been the Queen of TV Comedy, An Icon. And to then cast Lucy into the Norma Desmond role of someone who was forgotten, in need of the constant company of an adoring young man, AND crazy, is egregious. Not only contraditory, but also egotistical.Glad I avoided the bits where he fantasizes that he's actually reliving episodes of ""I Love Lucy""; to paraphrase Groucho Marx, sometimes a TV show is just a TV show."
4,Fascinating But Sometimes Disturbing,"Although I found the author to be somewhat creepy (what normal young man would spend so much time with a reclusive old lady?) I found the well-written depiction of Lucy's last decade to be mostly fascinating. The author is indeed a very talented writer, and it's a difficult book to put down. He does a really good job of describing life in Beverly Hills and for an aging superstar. Recommended."
4,We all love Lucy.,"This was a very good read if you are into celeb biographies. It is well written and interesting. The author, a close friend of Lucille Ball's, gives plenty of info both on her good side and bad. But even the criticism is written kindly.I just wish there had been more pictures."
5,"Lucy, Lee And Her Last Decade","The author takes you where few have been, up close and intimate with Lucy. It is evident from page one and woven throughout, that this book could only be written by someone that shared a special love with a special person. Written in a smooth, flowing, humorous style, the anecdotes almost forbid you to stop reading. It is an account of this icon's last ten years of her life that is a must read whether you were a Lucy fanatic or not."
3,"It should've been titled ""I Loved Lucy Ricardo""","This guy was so wrapped up in I Love Lucy re-runs that he seemed to forget that Lucille Ball had other talents. For the most part, the author was very good at describing the way people looked and acted and the places he encountered. At times I felt like I was right there in the middle of the action. However in almost every chapter he referred to ""I Love Lucy"", like he was living some dream of being Ethel Mertz. It was very distracting and got old real fast. I hope that he had more respect for her and Gary Morton than comes across in the book. He almost made it sound like poor Lucy was nobody 'til Lee Tannen showed up! On the other hand, some of the stories made it hard for me to put the book down and there was a nice little post script that had a list of things Lucy liked, which was enjoyable to read. I recommend this book, but either wait for the paperback, or check it out at the library. I can't believe I actually paid [amt] for this one!"
2,"I Loved Lucy, But Not This Book","What a shame. A love letter to Lucy devolves into a boorish opportunity to brag about Tannen's glamorous life, glamorous career, glamorous Manhattan apartment, etc. He didn't miss an opportunity to mention his partner's $100,000 salary, his ability to simply not go to work when he didn't want to, all of his fabulous friennds, and wonderful life.Tannen basically horned his way into Lucy's life and writes as if Lucy's life revolved around him. Because I loved Lucy, too, I found the book interesting. It was a peek, not a tell-all, into the private life of a woman loved by the world. It's just unfortunate that the telling of this story was overshadowed by the author's extraordinary need to let the reader know just how grand a life he leads."
2,Very easy reading and overview of toady's challenges,"The book helped me understand where these ""angry parents"" are coming from. If my district were full of all the wrongs listed in this book, I'd be angry too. Remember, however, that there are far more satisfied parents out there than ""angry"" ones.My belief that our district is doing the right things and on the right path was reinforced.I am fairly certain that most schools throughout the country have elements of the good and bad running through them. What this book does via it's title and subliminal inferences is imply that the bad is more common than the good. This reinforces the idea that American education is failing us.....nothing could be further from the truth.Parents should not read this and go out and storm the Board meetings. They should thoughtfully evaluate their schools and work within the system to make it even better.There is far more good happening in our schools than this book would have you believe."
2,Had to return it,"This little radio had great sound. However, it did not ""hold"" stations. On my morning walk I turned a corner and so did the radio........it lost my station and went to another. I returned it."
4,xmas gift,Received in a prompt manner. In very good shape and well packed. I purchased this as a gift for someone who walks and utilized public transporation alot. I did not want it to appear to be an expensive item. I was pleasantly surprised how compact it was but have not heard back from the receiver regarding the quality. Sorry. But from what I could see it met all my needs for the receiver.
1,huge disappointment,"never abused it, only gently used it, loved it, then after 4 weeks it died, finito!please spare me the time and aggravation of returning your defective merchandise!very disappointed."
2,not so good,item did not pick up good reception in my area of work it needs some sort of signal booster will not recommend
2,Earbuds destroy radio,"I looked forward to getting this compact radio. I enjoy listening to radio while I work construction. I've found that something close to my ears is the best solution. The Sony SRF-S84 is light-weight and compact. However, regardless of all of the features of the radio, it is absolutely no good if you can't hear it. That was my experience as I tried every way I knew how to keep the ears buds in my ears. The round design does not let them fit down into the ear. The least motion causes them to fall out. I spent a lot of time trying to make them work but it was taking time away from my work. I finally gave up in frustration. The radio and ear buds lay in my truck unused because of the ear buds. It has been a waste of money when you have a good radio but no way to listen to it."
5,amazing little product,"This tiny Sony walkman is powerful. I can finally get radio stations outside of boring Connecticut. I am so glad that I purchased this product, but then again you can never go wrong with Sony and Amazon.com, the place to buy everthing!"
2,Sony SRF-S84 Walkman Radio,"I bought this radio so I could listen to Coast to Coast AM while working overnight. It is highly sensitive to which direction you are turned - the station will quickly fade in and out if you are walking or moving. Overall, not a good value in my opinion."
5,Shocking. Powerful. Engrossing. Beyond Belief.,"John Grisham's amazing novel of a racist on death row and his grandson defending him is the most engrossing book you will ever read in a thousand lifetimes. Its in-depth analysis on capital punishment, racism, and forgiveness render it second to none. The plot flows faster a raging waterfall bringing you to the amazing climax while your holding on to your head to keep it from becoming overwelmed by the full characters"
4,"Not one of Grisham's best, but still very good!","Nothing written by John Grisham is bad, but this book certainly wasn't one of his best. The book had a good plot, and great character development, but just didn't have the un-dying suspense John Grisham readers are used to. The book also contained court jargon that was unnecessary for the reader. This made for slow reading and monotonous page-turning. However, if you like John Grisham based books, it is far from boring. If you like the court jargon this book contains, it is a must-read"
2,The Most Depressing Book of the Decade,"Granted, John can tell a story and set the background so clearly you can smell the stench from where Sam hasn't washed his hair. And maybe the fact that I read this during my nauseous first trimester of pregnancy made it worse than it is. But this is my very least favorite Grisham book--I'm just grateful I borrowed it from the library so I didn't waste my money on it. Usually I buy his books so I can read them again and again. Not this one. I couldn't shake the images of Death Row even when Adam was out in Memphis visiting his aunt. The book ended just like I thought it would, and I felt Sam deserved to die. Nothing in the book led me to believe he was deserving of a pardon or redemption. If John was trying to get us to think about capital punishment, he failed as far as I'm concerned. This character didn't have enough ""gray area"" for it--he was despicable"
4,One confusing book...but I liked it!,"I thought it was a really neat book because I mean, it was kind of different just because from everything else that I have ever read. But I thought it was kind of stupid how the author said that it was his grandson, and it in the summary it sounded to much more mysterious but then again, maybe that was just to attract readers and all. But I thought it was a pretty good book, and I thought there should have been some kind of like romance it the book to spice it up and the aunt was just in the way of everything and I don't think there should have been any reason as to put her in. And then in the end, I really liked it because it was like a cliffhanger so I mean...read it!"
2,The Chamber was only 600 pages long??,"It felt like longer. This book goes nowhere, slow. I would have given it a one, but Grisham actually develops character in this one, for the first time since A Time To Kill. Go watch the movie. It only takes 2 hours, and every plot element is there. The movie isn't that great, but it might keep you from reading the book, a positive thing. Meanwhile, keep waiting for a book as good as The Firm to come out... I just read the Street Lawyer, and I think he's coming close..."
1,Waste of Time!!!!!,"I was extremely offended by the fact that Grisham seems to dwell on a lawyer who doesn't seem to care for the family of those who were killed or that justice needs to be served. Adam Hall just wants to waste his time, dwelling on his stupid liberal antics on why his grandfather should not die. You tend to develop a real sense of hate towards him.However, the only reason I give this book 1 star (other than the fact that this site won't let me give less) is the fact that at the end, justice is served in that Sam Cayhall is put to death.I kept waiting for some twist in the plot, or some dark secrets to come out, but they never did. This book was an utter waste of my time. I cannot believe that the author of books as great as The Firm and The Rainmaker really wrote this junk. I strongly urge you to not read it!!!"
1,Depth,"Clumsy. A pathetic attempt to convey emotion. Ending was a total disappointment. Plots lines went nowhere. The characters are impossible to relate to and feel for. The point of the book is lost in the cliched descriptions. Someone else could have done better on this topic. For this author, not bad though."
4,Grisham is The Comander in Chief!,"Watch this one as Adam Hall learns how not to hate. And the character ""Cayhall"" kept my interest through out his ""unvealing"" in this heartfelt story that only Grisham could create so well."
5,Grisham's Political View: A Novel,"You're against death penalty or you are a supporter of this legal murder. This is the book, the good and the evil of death penalty. This Sam is surely very guilty but do killing him justifies?Did Grisham write The Chamber based on his political view? Sure you can think that yourself."
4,Good Book,"(...)After getting(...) into the book, I found myself pitying him when I learned what he was going through. I still hated him and considered him a miserable human being, but I didn't think he deserved to die like that. To do something like this with your writing requires incredible talent, something that I believe John Grisham has. Any other author might try to make you feel compassion for an awful and racist person and it certainly wouldn't work, it would probably annoy you. I found this was certainly not true with The Chamber. I have never agreed with the Death Penalty, but that was probably jsut because I grew up in a house were people would tell me that it was wrong. Never really knowing why it was really wrong I just accepted that that was the way things were. I now really understand what's so bad about it."
3,The Chamber,"John Grisham has written many captivating novels, including The Chamber. This novel is tells of a young lawyer's fight to save his grandfather's life. Adam Hall, a rookie from Chicago, takes on the case of Sam Cayhall, a former member of the KKK who has been wrongly convicted of a bombing and sentenced to the death penalty. (...) While this is not one of John Grisham's best novels, it is well-worth reading."
5,Riveting,"Very riveting story, after reading first 5 chapters I thought stor is over. Author's way of stretching a simple plot with good dialogues makes it interesting. At times, story does seem to be dragging. Researching the death row, and its gruesome details ... The end was a bit unpredictable. I thought it will be different. That is the power of imagination. I am not sure how many people in US are against death penalty now, but the story revolves around pre civil war era type USA, and its transition to a modern age 1990s."
3,The Chamber,"This novel is a family story about Mississippi in the late 1960s, civil rights, and the Klan, and examines all the possible pleas for clemency from a death penalty. It includes a graphic description of death row and the life of the inmates, and examines the arguments for and against the death penalty. Those who study law or want to know about possible legal alternatives may pick up a few ideas. The movie with Gene Hackman does not give the detailed procedures of law, just focuses on the story line. It is interesting to consider what customs have changed since that time and what mind-sets continue the same."
3,The Chamber,"I love John Grisham, but the story didn't have a conclusion I cared for. His later writings seem more crisp."
2,Returned it Before Finishing,"This book was not enjoyable. It's not only hundreds of pages of soap box (i don't mind that as long as said box is entertaining) but the characters are lacking any sort of appealing personality trait. The atty, Adam, is dullsville, the aunt is the most annoying creature ever (except for Mrs. Norris), and Sam is...well kinda interesting. This book is just long and dull and in no way invigorating. Grish has too many great books for a reader to plow through this one."
2,Disappointing,"Of the five Grisham novels I've read thus far, this is by far the worst. I'm puzzled to see so many found this book 'thrilling', as I thought it was extremely predictable. I found none of the characters to be likeable. The book contains several sub-plots which either add nothing substantial to the novel, or even more annoying simply vanish without a trace. This book will probably be satisfying to only the most die-hard of Grisham fans."
4,my review,"This is the book by Grisham that I enjoyed reading the most. It has all the elements to make it a great read: the lawyer who tries to save his grandfather from an atrocious death, the family wishing to see the killer of their sons finally put to death, and the people involved, wishing to use this case for political advancement. Great book and great plot."
1,Boring!,"The one and only time that I could not finish a Grisham novel. I loved The Firm, and the Pelican Brief, and all of his other novels to date, but found this book completely pointless. The story was uninteresting, and the characters pathetic. I hope that this was a once in a career bomb."
3,"Interesting story, but...","This was the first Grisham book that I've read, and I have some mixed reviews about it. While the plot and the story line are interesting and really makes you want to find out what happens next, the way the author presents the story, I feel, is a bit lacking. His writing style is plain and strictly to the point, and I personally enjoy reading novels that tend to be more emotional, elaborate, and powerful in the usage of language. Grisham presents the story, I guess, as a lawyer would, getting right down to the meat of the matter, but I feel he could make it just a bit more enjoyable to read. Also, it feels as if the story could be condensed into a somewhat shorter book; some of the material does seem a bit superfluous. I guess overall, his books are for the story (The plot of The Chamber is actually pretty good) which make for good movies, but if you want to really enjoy a book for it's artistic and literary merit, I'd suggest trying a different author."
5,"So, Grisham isn't a total hack afterall!","This is really a remarkable story -- rather a dark look at death row and capital punishment without being preachy (obviously Grisham's a liberal; all his books tout this, but one can overlook it here).It's not really the expected plot-driven fluff. It's a very moving and mature drama, full of details of life on death row which, though perhaps fictionalized, give one a glimpse of an experience quite beyond the norm. I didn't think Grisham could pull off something this good."
3,"Complex and unique, but could be better.","I have read this and the Rainmaker. Which was better? Take a guess. The Chamber had a good start, and I liked the characters because they all had good personalities and were outstandinly believable. However, I found it a tad boring, and was dragging on. I am a very avid reader, even at fourteen, and quite frankly I did not enojoy this book as much as I thought I would. Perhaps my expectations were too large (?). Eventhough not my style, I would recommend it to people who enjoy learning about death row and the likes. I personally found it inspiring for my own novel."
4,AN INTRIGUING & MOVING TALE,"The Chamber has to be John Grisham's best book. It is thought provoking and full of moral and arguments that make sense. The story progresses smoothly as well. To add to that, The Chamber is proof that John Grisham can induce sadness. The book raises many controiversial points against the death penalty and I think that the addition of these comments render the book infinitely substantial. There is also an argument on racism which is to be considered. The book is a rare breede book that makes you think and cry, the book that demands attention, the book that makes you hate the death penalty. Read the book, you'll be glad you did."
4,Good Book!,"Very enjoyable, however not as good as some others but I'm a loyal Grisham fan. The book is definitely better than the movie."
1,The worst Grisham has ever written,"After reading Grisham's other books like The FirmThe Pelican Brief, etc. this was the worst.I haven't ever read such a boring book in my life.This book kept going in a meaningless direction.I kept asking myself, ""When is he going to get to the point!"" Charles Dickens can write better."
1,Why is he a best selling author?,"I can't understand why Grisham books sell--I've never purchasedone after The Firm. This book is an argument against the deathpenalty with a totally despicable character that the reader is encouraged to be sympathetic toward. I oppose capital punishment but felt if it were ever deserved, it is in this case. It is never clear why Adam Hall, the grandson, cares so much for this person. *Dead Man Walking* did a far, far better job handling this topic. Glad I didn't purchase this."
1,Very Disappointing,"This was the most disappointing book I've read in years. Yes, it's well written in that the characters are well developed and you can really feel the emotion of the heartbreaking story. However there is no plot!! Many, many pages are spent laying the groundwork for exciting twists and new dimensions to the story -- but not a single twist or diversion to the story line ever comes to pass. The plot just plods along in 676 pages via a single, linear story line to the logical conclusion."
3,"LONG WINDED, NO TWISTS, INTERESTING DEBATE AND CHARACTERS","The Chamber is, in my opinion, one of Grisham's worst books. It is long winded and it has no major plot twists. The story is based on Cayall, a member of the KKK that bombs the office of a Jewish lawyer. He is put on death row and his grandson, who is a lawyer, takes the case and tries to run with it.On the positive side, there is plenty of character development and the ambiguity of good and evil is clear in most of the characters. The story is well described, to the point that the reader really gets involved in the feelings of the characters. However, the book just ends without any major occurrences that would make the reader skip a beat, as usual Grisham thrillers do. Another positive is the overall debate over the death penalty.Overall, this is a decent book, not a Grisham."
2,huh?,"This was tough for me to finish. I almost quit a couple of times. I didn't get the appeal of this book, as apparently so many other readers have. I found it unsuspenseful, and I didn't find any engaging characters. I guess the nuanced issues surrounding the death penalty could have been interesting, but it was somehow presented in a way that made me think ""hmm, some ambiguous moral soup here, but that's just how things are."" Sorry to say it, but Grisham seems to have mailed it in here, in the writing if not the research."
1,"Not a thriller, so boring.","Thought it was another thriller from John Grisham, but my assumption was wrong. Very boring, I found myself frequently skipping pages."
1,STAY AWAY,"Note to John Grisham: If you're going to push your views on capital punishment on the public in any future books, please have the decency to ascribe at least one redeeming quality in the death-row character. Give us a little reason for caring. What a waste of time this book was. Any person who opposes the death penalty and reads this book will quickly change their mind. It's incredible to believe that this is the best that the author could come up with to support his view that capital punishment is wrong. He could have fooled me! Skip the book. Jam a nail in your eye. It's probably not as painful."
1,Total Boring waste of time,"The chamber is by far Grisham's worst piece of work. The story was flat, dull and boring, a total waste of time. In the beginning, it seemed to have a good premise, however, Mr. Grisham wrote this book to death (no pun intended!). After about 90 pages, I flipped to the end to see what the verdict was guilty as charged, as I suspected. Ah there I gave away the ending with absoltely no loss to humanity! However, The chamber should not take away from Grisham's other fine literary works. A Time to Kill, the Client, the Firm and the Pelican Brief."
1,I did not like this book.,"I have all of John Grisham's books, but this I put down half way through it. He spent so much time describing how people are executed in prison, it made me sick. I have not been able to pick the book up to finish reading. If I were given the choice of rating this book ""0"" stars, I would have."
3,Intriguing...,"Having read The Firm, The Rainmaker and enjoying both, I tackled The Chamber with great ferosity. I found the book easy to read in the fact that it kept me turning pages. I thought the character development was good for Adam, but not as good for Sam. I guess it depends on the focus of the book, but which character is the focus on ?? I felt the ending left a little to be desired, and quite frankly, I put the book down wanting more... too many loose ends, Rollie Wedge, his aunt etc etc...However, I must say it was a good read and an eye-opener to some of the myths and tradgies of the Death Penalty."
2,This is an example of why Grisham is more popular than good.,"Grisham was never really a good writer -- he just came up with a few good stories and told them adequately. In this book, he even failed at that modest aim.The whole purpose of the book seems to be to give Grisham a forum for arguing against the death penalty -- though I'm not even sure about that. If that was his goal, he tried to accomplish it by making us sympathize with an old, sick man on death row. Sorry, but he was once a young, healthy murderer. Executing him sooner would have solved the old, sick man issue."
3,"Quick, easy and interesting read...dull ending.","Must read for Grisham fans, but not the best place to start for newcomers. Moves along quickly with excellent character developement. Grisham could have spent a little more time developing a less disappointing ending, but was most likely in a hurry to pick up his paycheck."
5,READ THIS BOOK,"I am a relatively new Grisham fan, and this is the best book of his that I have read so far. I loved _The Firm_, _The Pelican Brief_, _The Client_ and _The Runaway Jury_, but this was so incredible it's hard to put into words. Anyone who reads _The Chamber_ will become an instant opposer of the death penalty and all its cruelty. Yes, there is less action than in his previous books, but this opens up space for a theme that will bowl you over."
1,Horrible,"John Grisham is another author without a creativetalent. All books are the same. The style, the language and the themes are never changing.If you read one book you know them all."
3,The Chamber,"John Grisham has written many captivating novels, including The Chamber. The story is of Sam Cayhall, a KKK member who was accused and convicted of another man's crime, but is reluctant to reveal his identity for the security of his family. His lawyer is his grandson, Adam, who was completely unknown to him until four weeks before his execution. While tring to save his grandfather's life, Adam attempts to uncover all of his family history, which turns out to be a horrible display of murder, lies, and secrets. With the help of his alcoholic aunt, he learns much about his past and that of his ancestors. During the duration of the novel, Sam's pessimism, due to the lack of affection from loved ones, is terminated with the development of relationships with these individuals. This novel is is not one of John Grisham's best works, but it is well-worth reading."
2,A grind to read,"Grisham must've lost his editor in the mail on this one. It's yeoman's work to make us care about a old racist reprobate about to get his just desserts; it's even more difficult when the histrionics (however subtle) go on a hundred pages too long. Combine that with superflouous subplots (the aunt's problems and the dead dad) and you get a seriously longwinded, meandering, unfocused book. Suggestion to Grisham: take two or three good ideas, wrap them around a decent main plot, and interweave them so that they are coherent and relevant to each other."
4,A book that makes you think.,"After reading the firm and the pelican brief, this book was totally different. There's no organised crime money laundering or anything like that, its just a really well written book that keeps your opinion changing the whole way through about the death penalty. Its Grishams best written book to date."
4,"A somewhat prolonged story, but good page-turning suspense.","Grisham delivers yet another powerful novel about (what else?)law and the justice system. Sam and Adam Cayhall are believablecharacters whose contrasting traits give the novel a more rousingand realistic tone. The ending particularly will grab the reader'ssuspense. The sublime subject matter of a family member's sentenceto death is definitely something that will come up later at thedinner table. The one weakness of the book is that it is slightlyoverwritten and sometimes dull, which makes you rather want to watchCourt TV. But overall it is good, solid entertainment, and gets yournoodle thinking!!"
1,AS USUAL-GARBAGE,"John Grisham never ceases to amaze me with thoughtless writing and trite plots. No characters, no theme, poor writing-a typical Grisham. It started with The Firm, and has continued until this day. His books are a disgrace to all writers in general, and specifically to lawyers and politicians. Every page I read was pure agony as I contemplated burning the book more than once. However, I finished just so I can write this review, and warn people off of this book. It was awful. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."
5,A Great Book That Really Made You Think,"When I read stories about the KKK it really makes me cringe to think that someone could be that ruthless to another human being just because they hate a certain race of people. I felt the same way about Sam during most of the book(I mean that man hated anybody but his own family), but I can see the affect that his family had on him when he was younger. It seems that he really didn't have chance because that was all he knew and even Adam said that if he was born 40 years earlier that he would probably be no different than Sam. So I felt sorry for Sam toward the end of the book because he was truly sorry for the lives that he ended and also the lives that he ruined forever.I think Adam was the real hero in this book for staying by his grandfather side even though he knew the things that he had done, and showingSam that living a life of racism results only in Death."
1,and the point was....?,"I've read several Grisham novels and have enjoyed the pace and the suspense - two things that were sadly lacking in The Chamber. The characters were unlikeable, the storyline slow and predictable and the ethical questions too contrived."
1,Want to cure insomnia and regret buying a book? Read this.,"If you want to get thought provoking stuff on the consequences of the death penalty here is my suggestion: Go to a video store and rent the movie ""Dead Man Walking"". ""The Chamber"" is a boring, pointless slog that goes on and on and on and on and on until you pitch the wretched thing into the fireplace. Grisham is always switching sides on how we should view Sam Cayhall and never stays on one long enough to make a point. Stay as far away from this book as possible!! You have been warned."
2,A disapointing attempt at thrilling literature,"Grisham's best books are the thrilling fights against powerful enemies not yet fully known; this theme makes The Firm, The Pelican Brief and The Client such exciting stories.That his first book (A Time to Kill) did not sell at fist didn't suprise because it just goes on and on in this flimsy tale of legal chitchat of a starting lawyer defending a black man's murder of the rapist of his daughter.The Chamber gave me the same feeling. It feels like a poor attempt to write a literary, philosophical and ethical thriller - presenting the death penalty as an issue (but not really discussing it) and missing the chances of real suspense in the story.I gave it two stars because of the description of the last hours of Adam and his grandfather, which I found really moving.But they didn't make me forget that I had thought I bought a thriller."
2,Diatribe Against the Death Penalty,This is a lousy book. It is more like a diatribe against the death penalty with a littlefiction thrown in for support. It is 600+ pages of boredom and sloppy thinking. Irecommend other Grisham books instead of this.
4,Very entertaining,This is my 1st John Grisham book. I found it extremely entertaining and thought provoking. If this is the quality of John's books I certainly look forward to reading others written by him.
4,Much Deeper Then His Other Books,"For me this was one of his better books. The reason is that I think he took a story line that had some real meaning and most of us see parts of on the TV all the time. He then really got into the characters and story. He develops it all the way to the end. I truly felt for the prisoner at the end of the book. The book does not move off the main path it set for itself. A lot of my friends felt the book was too slow or heavy, but for me I think most of his other books have been to easy and light. You have to and want to spend time with this book. The time pays off in the end with a book that you will remember for a good time to come."
2,"Boring, no suspense","We read all of Grisham's books and found this the worst. It is boring and could last a half of the pages without losing anything. We only kept reading because we were hoping for something to happen at last, but it never happened."
4,A Look at the Death Penalty,"This book is not only interesting but gives a great deal of insight into life on ""death row,"" at least in the state of Mississippi, and the appeals process involved with stays of execution and commutation of sentences. It touches on activities of the Ku Klux Klan. It was my impression that the author leans toward those who favor the abolition of the death penalty. However, some sympathy is found for the victims of crime. The story centers on Sam Cayhall who is sentenced to death after several trials over a number of years following the crime. Sam's grandson becomes his attorney during the last months of appeal from ""death row."" The latter part of the book leaves one wondering whether or not there will be an execution. Meanwhile Sam shows repentance and response to the prison's chaplain.I found it to be one of the better John Grisham books."
2,Definitelt not his best but good none the less,"Well JohnI've read all you've written and I give you a 3. I admit it gives great insight as to the gray areas of the death penalty, but moved too slow in most areas. By far worth reading for anyone who has aspirations of becoming an attorney."
2,Well Defined Characters - Very Weak Ending,"This book left me wanting, unsatisfied, and thinking of half a dozen better ways to have ended it. The characters are well defined, even likable, and the theme is thought prevoking. The story is built on a house of cards that collapses from a weak ending."
1,awful,"The ending is as anti-climactic as any I have read. I loved the Firm, enjoyed the Pelican Brief, and hated the Client. I decided to give Grisham one more shot, but after this, you'd have to pay me to read another of his books. If you're interested in capital punishment issues, do your own research - it will be far more interesting than reading this book."
1,Worst book i have ever read!,"I have read many JG books and love him. This book is long, boring, predictable and just plane stupid. I absolutely hate the plot, characters and even detest the paper that it is printed on. I can not say enough bad things about this book. It should be titled ""The Torture Chamber""."
1,Very boring,I like all of J.G.'s books except this one. I couldn't even finish it!I thought the plot of the story was slow and it put me to sleep.
1,Y-A-W-N,This book is BORING. It's slow moving and I wonder how John Grisham thought of such a boring plot. He is a good writer and has written many interesting books but this book is a total disappointment.
1,BORING AND A WASTE OF TIME,I have read all of John Grisham's books and enjoyed them all except for this one. I found it boring - I don't know why I bothered to finish the whole book.
2,Didn't finish it!,"Maybe it was because the Woodward verdict came through whilst I was reading this; that put me of legal eagles for sure, but to be honest I was struggling before that. I devoured the Client and A Time to Kill, but just couldn't get into this one. Sorry John I know you need the money!! NOT!"
1,NO!!!,"This book is by far the most BORING book I ever read. The only reason I kept reading it till the end was I thought something interesting might still happen. Needles to say it didn't ,the end was quite like the rest of the book dull and unintersting. :-("
3,Slow Going,"The Firm was a ""10."" Not so, The Chamber. At least 200 pages too long. One redeeming feature was a glimpse into the machinations of death-row litigation."
2,I've read better from John!!,"NOT one of Mr. Grisham's better effects, truly one of his cerebral projects."
3,It was OKAY!,"Not one of Grisham's best. I really did not feel for the grandfather that Grisham's main character tried saving. You can read it but if you only had one choice, this is definitely not the book I recommend. :)"
3,Could have done more with the subject,"The death penalty is a highly-charged, emotional affair. Knowing this, Grisham proceeds to write a novel with almost no emotion in it. In what seems to be an attempt to persuade the reader against the death penalty, Grisham fails to present a plot which might change minds. Nobody would want the convict in this story to get gassed. Because the convict is such a sympathetic character, Grisham loses the opportunity to argue against the death penalty in those cases where the convict is less sentimental. In any event, the story is only mildly intriguing, but not a bad book if you're taking it to the beach for some easy reading."
4,The Chamber,"As usual John Grisham writes books that are very interesting and readable, by that I mean he writes in language that the average reader can understand. He is my 2nd favorite author, the 1st is books by John Jakes."
1,Typical John Grisham,"This is the fifth of Grisham's books that I've read, and it will be the last. It's typical Grisham, with sub-plots ad infinitum. About two thirds the way through, I just got bored and said to heck with it. None of Grisham's books have a definitive ending, they just kind of drift off and leave you hanging. This is no different. From what I did read, it's basically nothing more than a rant against capitol punishment."
2,boring,i love grishams books and his style of writing but the chamber was boring and not very interesting
4,Pretty Good Read,"You know the author is good when he can make you tear up for a former KKK member on Death Row. While the book was a little slow at times, I couldn't wait to turn the page and find out what happens next. If you like John Grisham, you'll like this book."
4,Thought provoking,"After a cursory glance at the reviews given this book by fellow readers, I am surprised to see that people cannot appreciate this book for what it really is. Grisham apparently intented to abandon his normal commercially appealing style in order for him to bring an important issue to the forefront. Grisham does an excellent job of weaving through the the processes involved in evoking the death penalty and infuses the story with sentiment from both sides. It would have been easy for him to stack all the cards against the death penalty, and have the main character merely be a pawn which was framed in a crime. Rather every time the reader feels excessive sympathy for Sam, another vile act from his past is exposed, and once again the readers sympathy is put in jeopardy. I think Grisham did a masterful job with this book, the only fault being its unecessary length. This book could have been easily abridged by approximately 150 pages."
1,Grisham gets no more of my money after this awful monologue,"Having enjoyed many of Grisham's earlier books, I looked forward to his latest novel. However, this book lacks plot, mystery, intrigue, character, and suspense. Basically, he takes too many pages to say ""the death penalty is bad"". I never felt compassion for the convicted murderer and couldn't believe that any grandson would actually go through these motions. Don't waste your money or time on this one."
1,No Grisham book took longer to read!,"I have read all Grisham books, seen (afterwards) all Grisham movies, but none is as dissapointing as this book. All through reading the book I was waiting for the suspense to start. I thought many times: when does the story start. And when the pages left to read became fewer and fewer, I got this strange feeling: Is there a story in this book? After finishing it I had a very unsatisfied feeling and wanted to read The Chamber II, the sequel... Maybe the story is in there....."
4,"Top of the line Grisham, don't miss it, a high recommend!!.","One of the best of Grisham's batch of legal bestsellers.You'll find it hard to lay down once you start and beforeyou're done you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll surely questionyour own views on the death penalty. I was an avowed advocateof capitol punishment before reading this book;now I'm notso sure! It's hard to imagine caring about the fate of aconfessed killer, but under Grisham's skilled pen, Sam becomesa real person and somebody you actually feel like you know.Theidealistic young lawyer, Adam, who finds the grandfather henever knew and a cause he never imagined, is a hero who is bothlikeable and plausible.Definitely a recommended read."
1,did grisham really write it?,"The Rainmaker is my favorite book. I'm only 11 so you may find me a bit immature to recommend a book to a person who is an adult. I was extremely dissapointed with this novel. The plot was extremely dull, and I could only bring myself to read half of it. I am still questioning whether or not Grisham actually wrote this book. It dragged on almost as badly as ""Titanic"" and was a complete waste of time. I sincerely do not recommend it to anyone, even if you do enjoy the author's books as much as I do. It is not as exhililrating as ""The Firm"" and ""The Pelican Brief,"" as heartwarming as ""The Rainmaker"" and ""The Street Lawyer,"" and the book is just a disappointment. I have sympathy for anyone who brought them through the entire book."
3,Made for Grisham fans...2 1/2 stars,"This book tries to stir debates about the death penalty, but it only stirs debates about Grisham waning talent.If you are a Grisham fan, you will read this book. If you are not a Grisham fan, and you want to see what the fuss is about, pick another Grisham novel."
4,Very good but could've been a little better.,"A great book...maybe not one of Grisham's best. I have to say it was very unpredictable and not usual Grisham. I say it could've been better in that if it had a little more action, for example: Lets say Sam decided to talk and Wedge decided to take action...That in my oppinion Grisham could have made very interesting, but none the less the book got its message through even to me, a thirteen year old without a whole lot of reading experience, and made me want to read more Grisham."
4,Death Row--Good Read,"This is a good book giving insight to the justices and perhaps injustices of death row. It is a long story(Paperback is 600+ pages)which will loose some readers because often the story seems to provide filler information not critical to the plot. However, stick with it, it is definitely worth reading. There are plenty of twists which keep your interest."
4,"A great Grisham novel, but a bit slower than others","This is a great Grisham novel, with most of the classic pieces of his novels, including the great young lawyer attacking a big case. This book is more emotionally charged than others, due mostly to the subject matters. Due to the lack of ""court room drama"" this book reads a bit slower, but do not give up on this book! It is the whole picture that is worth it, not just pieces."
2,Kept waiting for it to get intriguing or at least exciting.,Where was the punch to the book? Very mundane. No suspense. More like a documentary on death row inmates.
2,Only 100 pages left to go....,"Oh my God....it has taken me a month and a half to get through this book. I dread going to bed at night to read it in spite of my dogged determination to get through it. While I find most of Grisham's stuff to be shallow but at least entertaining, the Chamber, however, is dull dull dull. Having bamboo shoved under my fingernails is sound pretty good as an alternative to yet one more evening struggling through this book. Next time you're browsing the Grisham section leave this one on the shelf you wouldn't want to disturb the dust."
2,Grisham's worst by far...,"I was surprised Grisham could write something this boring. This is by FAR his worst novel. Halfway interesting at the get-go, this story just turns into a sleeper. I didn't think it was ever going to end (with a predictable ending might I add). Are we supposed to feel sorry for this convicted murderer? I think not. The movie's even worse."
1,Good God it's Awful!!,"Why does Grisham keep selling? I got through the first 30 pages and finally finished this book in bits and pieces over the next year. It's boring and poorly written. Grisham apparently had one good book: the Firm. I hate to say it as a fellow Mississippian ,but with the possible exception of King, Grisham is the most over rated writer today. He should read a Koontz or a Clancy and get an idea of what a good thriller really should be."
