2,You get what you pay for...,"This chair is really cheap so it at least deserves an extra star for that. Otherwise i find it very uncomfortable. The front of the seat pushes up against the back of my legs so it's pretty bad for circulation. The cushion is really thin and you can feel the wood inside, which will crack fairly easily if you lean to the side even slightly. My back hurts if I sit in it for more than 2 or 3 hours at a time because it's not really ergonomically curved for any sort of support. All in all it's a great deal if you just want something to sit on for 30 minute sessions but if you spend a lot of time sitting on a day to day basis you really should get something nicer for your own health."
3,Good Value for Money,"Good value for money, but didn't last. After about two years it started to rip badly. For the cost, this is a decent chair. Looks good and is relatively comfortable."
4,Good Hood,"For less than $10 this is a handy little accessory to go with your camera or camcorder. I'm using it with a Panasonic HDC-SD5. Screws on and off easily and works like any good hood should. This is an all metal design so it does not collapse, but it still is very portable since it is only a 37mm design. Great deal for an accessory that is overlooked often."
1,A badly written mess,"I live in Florida. I knew a lot about this case prior to reading this book. Not only was this book full of misleading information (Goths and Vampires are not one and the same) it tries to make Heather into some poor misguided little girl who never had any idea something was wrong. I can buy that peer pressure made this girl do what she did, but Jones never really explores that avenue. She goes from telling us that Heather thought this was all a goof to being a shell shocked, pathetic figure who can't figure how what's up. How did she get from one end of the spectrum to the other? Jones doesn't tell us.Almost every paragraph had a word or three in italics, Jones way of pointing out that this little bit of information was important. If her writing was better, she wouldn't need to highlight the important information by putting it in italics. She's also be able to give a deeper story into what happened instead of this shallow waste of time."
1,"It's Roderick, not Rodney.",This author clearly has not done even basic research on this case or she would at least know the correct name for the focus of her book.
1,Pure crap,"Let me give you the idea of how this book flows.#1: Rod does something horrible.#2: Rod tells all his followers that he is something .#3: Rod does something weird.#4: Rod explains that he is something else than #2.Ok, next paragraph, start over. This sums up about the first 320 pages of this book. I have no idea how this actually was published. The story, while being an interesting one, is horribly told in this book. There is a lot of stuff that the author just threw in the book that does not fit in the story, make sense, or is absolutely meaningless. I'm glad I paid $0.01 for this book and not full cover price.Aphrodite Jones may be able to ""look terror right in the eye"" as the back of the book says, but she sure didn't know how to tell about it with this book."
2,good story bad writer,This was a really good book if you like those in which you can't understand where the writer is going. It felt as if the story just dragged on an on in her own words. There wasn't much of quotes from the experienced lives. You had to understand from the writers point of view and not the characters.
4,The Embrace is deep,"The Embrace by Aphrodite Jones was a great book. I really had no clue at all about the story before i read the book. Not only did she do a good job on the book, it almost made me think she made things up by all the interviewing she did. There are so many facts in this book that she must have spents years getting them together. Aphrodite Jones wrote the book so good about Rod Ferrell and his clan that i felt that i was right there and living what they were living. Over all this book is great, if you like true crime books you got to get this."
1,"Panic, panic...blah,blah,blah...teens are all out to get us","Not another book about a few psychotic teenagers who are making the rest of youth culture look bad. Somehow I always read this trash--maybe this is what quitting smoking is like. Her writing is bad--want to read a real true crime story, try Capote's ""In Cold Blood."" I get real tired of the ""roleplaying games are evil"" media craze. These teens were sick. Roleplayers and roleplaying games are not subverting the youth of America-- parents who let TV babysit their kids are. Maybe the whole true crime genre is down the tubes. This book is for paranoid, bored housewives."
5,This book strikes a chilling cord.(IDLY),"Ms. Jones brings to light what some would rather keep behind closed doors. This could be happening in any neighbor hood be it New Jersey or Vermont. This gruesome tale is told with such hue that uncovers the underlying issues of today's youth. She draws you into the minds of those who live on the ""dark side"" and makes you want to know more. Ms Jones' writing style, in this book as well as her others, makes me curious about her own family and up bringing."
2,Interesting Story Poorly Written,"In The Embrace Aphrodite Jones tells the story of the murders of Rick and Ruth Wendorf by a self proclaimed coven of ""vampires."" The story telling is often flawed by Ms.Jones use of shifting points of view and highly ""purple"" prose.Essentially The Embrace is an eye-opening account of lost teens in America that raises more questions than it really answers. The story of Rod Ferell and his followers was an interesting one if just for the fact that it opens a door on a world that most of us don't know about either by choice or plain ignorance. The children depicted in the book could have been helped if only someone showed interest and concern. More than the story of two murders this book is a morality tale of the childern who are lost in today's society.Had this book been better written it may have reached a larger audience. If it is available in your local bargain book store it is worth the read but I wouldn't go out of my way to hunt it down."
1,"Good Story, Incorrect Information","This made a great story and I couldn't put it down... until I talked with some of the real people involved. The problem is she takes the facts and adds her own opionion to it, mixing up the truth. Though this is based on a true story, her version is 75% fiction. If you want a version based on Pure facts, try Linedecker's version."
1,"Wow, I just woke up","I picked this book up because I thought it would be interesting to find out what was in the mind of Rod Ferrell. What I got instead was a wasted $7. Ms. Jones is a very poor writer. The first 150 pages or so kept repeating the same things over and over again. I can't count how many times she wrote that Charity drank Rod's blood. Hello, we get the point. By the time I got to the actual crime itself, I was already frustrated with her lack of narrative and any semblance of chronological order.I do agree with some of the reviewers who said this book portrays kids who role play as bad seeds. I think this is a gross generalization. I also agree with the reviewer who said that it appears as if Ms. Jones was in a hurry to finish the book.I wouldn't waste my money on this one if you can help it."
1,Stupid,"I'm pretty sure Aphrodite Jones interviewed the players thoroughly as the ideas she managed to write down in detail could only come from the minds of juveniles who have watched too many bad movies and played too many video games.What the reader gets is an in-depth look at a group of nit-wits, murderous nit-wits, certainly, but nit-wits none-the-less.Avoid this one. I'm really only giving it .02 stars."
1,Who would ever want to read this book?,"I can't believe anyone would want to read a gruesome book like this. I mean I like vampire books, but most of them are fiction ya know? This sounds like a very depressing story and I feel bad for the people involved in the whole thing"
3,I vant to such yer blaaaahhhd,"I rather enjoyed this book. From what I know of the case, it seemed to be a fairly accurate account of events. But I've yet to compare this with other writings on the Ferrel case.My issue with this book is the fact that it was SO repetitive. She pounds the same facts in to you throughout each chapter. But that wasn't her intention. It's more like she couldn't remember what she'd already written in previous chapters and would write it again. She tends to change sides often too. It would have been much more effective of presenting the facts if she had just stayed neutral instead of letting her opinions shine through (and boy do those take turns as well).If you're into true crime or just vampire culture/media/myth/etc (as I am) then grab a copy. Otherwise, it doesnt make much of a good read."
5,an interesting insight into the world of teenage vampires,ms. jones has once again come thru in her book. i have read all of ms. jones' books and enjoyed each of them. she has a way of taking the gruesome information she researches and put it into words to make you want to read.ms jones' is one of the best true crime authors around.
1,ANOTHER SLAP AT ROLEPLAYING,"This book is yet another attempt to attack role- playing, making it the latest bugbear of the Christian Right(after rock music). It's also an attack on Goths, with little or no true information on what ""Goth"" is(like last year's media misinformation campaign after Columbine). Pass on this piece of fluff and pick up any White Wolf Games sourcebook, to see what role- playing truly means. Or read PIERCING THE DARKNESS by Katherine Ramsland, which takes a fairer look at roleplayers and Real Vampyres."
2,"Interesting read, horrible writing","This book is about a very interesting subject. But it has no narrative flow, and is filled with poor editing. It's impossible to know what happens when in this haphazard, randomly thrown together collection of interview notes."
3,so-so,"In Eustis, Florida fifteen-year old Heather Wendoff wanted independence so badly she wished her parents were dead. She soon meets sixteen-year old Rick Ferrell and his followers. Heather becomes a Ferrell groupie and on November 25, 1996, Rick and his cohorts make her wish come true by murdering her parents. Rick's gang fled to New Orleans where he promised his vampire friends will protect them. Instead, Rick is the youngest person on death row.THE EMBRACE is an interesting account of the ""vampire"" killings of a few years ago. Of most interest to fans of true life crime is the ease in which Rick recruits his teenage followers even though his ramblings seem insane. In spite of a morbid curiosity as to the force of Rick's charisma, the true life story seems flat at times. This occurs even though Aphrodite Jones tries to spice it up with melodramatic accounts about an egomaniacal teen who fanatically cherishes Anne Rice and Marilyn Manson.Harriet Klausner"
1,Intriguing topic handled in a pedestrian manner.,I kept wondering when the author was going to achieve some narrative and structural focus. I kept trying to overlook the down-right bad writing. I kept wondering what a talent like Truman Capote might have done with this story. But I never gave a damn about any of the people not even the victims.
3,Only 1/2 Interesting!,"This book starts out good and keeps your attention with the antics of these wanna-be ""vampires"", and their idiot schemes. The court readings are just that, court room scripts and thus very boring...couldn't wait to finish this book, just to be out of my misery. The pictures were better then the writings and that's not saying a whole lot either."
4,The is the 1st book I have read from Jones...Intriguing ****,"I recommend the book ""The Embrace"" for any reader that is intrigued by true crime and/or vampire culture. Through every chapter I could not wait for the next. Every character is individually recognized for there part in the events that occurred. I found more great information at the following site. http://www.vampireclan.skcentral.com"
4,What an embrace,"I recommend the book ""The Embrace"" for any reader that is intrigued by true crime and/or vampire culture. Through every chapter I could not wait for the next. Every character is individually recognized for there part in the events that occurred. I found more great information at the following site. http://www.vampireclan.skcentral.com"
5,Absolutely amazing,"Everyone taking their first physics course or needing a brush up on elementary physics would benefit tremendously from viewing this masterpiece. I know I did! In a beautifully minimilist setting (just a talking head with a 3-foot whiteboard), you watch Jason Gibson solve all the basic problems in a style that is personal and light-hearted yet never infantile. It is great fun to watch and really educational. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars."
4,"""Ultimate""?","This DVD set is definitely not an ultimate physics tutor, but it does give a good explanation of ""Mechanical"" physics. However, the rest of physics is not mentioned, like ""Mechanical Waves & Oscillatory Motion"", ""Thermodynamics"", ""Electricity & Magnetism"", ""Light & Optics"" and ""Modern Physics"".If this program was titled ""The Ultimate 101 Phyisics Tutor"" then I would have rated it with 5 stars because it's excellent for someone who's taking a first course in physics.Other than that, simplicity combined with conciseness in presentation makes this program superb in relaying knowledge, without the need for fancy animations or vague concepts.P.S. The above review was written before the author made a sequel which is about Thermodynamics. The author is fantastic and should be commended for his work. I hope he continues on with this material and completes the physics topics."
3,OKAY,"I didn't raise my overall grade, but I believe the dvd's helped me understand some chapters a bit better."
4,Player Great but Software not user friendly,I love the size and sound of this player. I upgraded memory so playback is longer. Software really stinks. I had to call manufacturer to resolve a problem.
2,"excellent hardware design, but not the rest","I own SV-SD80. It seems to me, that SD85 is the same model with bigger SD card. The sound is awesome, and it's the tinest player. But the rest is just unacceptable. Provided software is one the worst I ever saw. The ""firmware upgradable"" is just a promise, I still can't find upgrade and ""play list"" feature is still not available. It's hard to manage all songs on a big card as a lump. And I'm still hoping to get some helpful reply from Panasonic's customer support. This is the reason of giving 2 start instead of 5. BTW, I'm not pleased with it's headphones. I'm using foldable Sennheiser px-200; and so far did not see (hear) anything better."
4,"Exceptional hardware, bad software.","It's tiny, it's easy to use, has excellent battery life, and it sounds great. They had to spoil it someplace. The software, as usual.Instead of letting you copy MP3/WMA/AAC files directly from Windows explorer, you are required to encrypt them and use their proprietary software. You can't even use your own SD card writer; the software won't recognize other than the one supplied.I don't get it. Who at Panasonic could have made such a terrible decision, allegedly to ""procect music copyright"". Stop the BS... if I want to, I can pirate those songs even using the supplied SD Card reader. It's just that they won't play on the SV-SD85 if thet are not encrypted with the software.Hopefully a better software will come out (if it were at least integrated into Windows explorer, I wouldn't complain so much).Don't get me wrong; it's still a great buy. Besides, it seems that all players use some kind of proprietary software."
1,"WARNING: Can not use protected music files, even leaglly pur","WARNING: The Panasonic SD-80 does not allow any protected files to be uploaded, legally purchased or not. It a great little player, the right size and lots of functionality BUT, if you can't upload your favorite music its not very functional. Since the future trend is to purchase songs rather than albums, more and more music will be purchased off Internet sites. None of these songs will be useable on the SD-80 and Panasonic has stated it has no intention of revising the software to allow the upload of legally purchased protected files. Great little player, BUT A WASTE OF MONEY."
3,"So small, so cute","I've spent the last hour trying to install software so that my boyfriend can use my computer to put music onto his MP3 player. While the SV-SD85 is small, cute, has good sound quality and is relatively tough, the software is proprietary and if you're disorganized, like he is, then you will loose the install drivers. Well, don't because it has a version of realplayer on it that has coding specific to panasonic. If you try to drag and drop files, you will be sorely disappointed (like I was). Don't try to go to the Panasonic website to download the drivers either, they're not there."
3,Love the SV-SD85 but hate the software,"My husband bought this for me in Singapore last month. It's exactly what I wanted. Small, uses cheap SD cards and runs forever. But the software is insane. I keep trying to import my MP3 files and it just keeps crashing. Every so often I get it to take a few more songs.The mood thing is great. I created playlists by mood which was easy. Just figured out how to get to the playlist today. Hint: Set Mode in the middle, turn on, press FF key, when it says Playlist, press FF key again, then use volume keys to move between playlists. Very intuitive, huh?Also, I hate having to use the USB reader that came with it to write SD cards. It is very slooooooow. Had to leave it all night to put my songs on the card.But it runs forever - I was stuck on a flight from JFK to San Diego behind a screaming kid, played songs the whole way. Ahhh..."
5,Young Readers,"GREAT FOR YOUNG READERS, I have read all of the Brides series. This one was wonderful. P L E A S E write more books like this."
3,Spunky tomboy doesn't know her place,"Glory, an orphan of sorts herself, flees a disagreeable home and town, only to find she really doesn't fit in much anyplace. After Poppy dies, she is sought by wicked Uncle Amos. Fleeing, she has to defend her virtue, bearing the guilt of what she left behind. If there is anything wagon master Lincoln does not need, it is another girl to have to care for and transport to his final destination. Stubborn, unlearned and unkempt, Glory is determined to make it on her own. Mystery, action and romance happen in spite of Glory, certainly not because of her."
3,Stick with the trilogy!,I did not know that the trilogy had been extended until I found this book. It should have stayed a trilogy. The plot is flat and rather uneventful. The previous characters are barely mentioned. I had to force myself to finish this book. Check out the first three. They were wonderful. I guess you only ride a horse for so long before it goes lame.
5,A Must Have For Any Musician,"I am a huge Sam Cooke fan, and this book has helped me learn how to play several of his songs on the piano and guitar. Excellent!"
4,Pretty sweet - nice and slick.,"Although this stuff is inferior to Curb Candy, it still makes grinds nice, even on extremely rough surfaces. It does last a real long time."
2,Lasted only a few months,"I got this collar because we had a reflective braided leash (that we got from Walmart) that was the best leash we've ever tried and I thought this reflective braided collar would be great too (even though it wasn't from the same company). However, this collar also has an unbraided portion, which is the weakest link in this case. The braided part is strong enough (although not as strong as the Walmart leash we had) but beyond that, the unbraided portion was flimsy. Not only would the end of the collar beyond the buckle keep slipping out, but the rings on the unbraided portion would break off and that portion would start to fray, so we had to replace it because the collar was slipping off every time our dog pulled hard on it when leashed.I could see this collar lasting longer for a small dog, but we have a strong 60-lb dog that will pull against the leash sometimes and this collar just couldn't withstand that."
5,A classic!,A excellent book for people who have a interest in history of the High Plains. For people like me who grew up on ranches and farms in eastern Colorado and other similar states and experienced barb wire and wind mills and droughts this book has a special meaning. The book fills in somethings that I never gave much thought.
3,Sailor Moon stars!,"I just wanna say that i love Sailor Moon, and i loved this book. I will not ruin it for u by telling u much but it had me in suspense the whole time!"
1,Snore Fest '00,I find these smile books to be extremely boring. What upsets me the most is the Amercanization of the story. Why play around with an already excellent story? References to calvin kline and other things is like making a joke of Sailor Moon. I wish they would stick with the original script for the episodes and not invent new people and situations that don't affect the story. Alot of the emotion is dumbed down in these stories. Some attacks are the original Japanese ones while others are the DIC version. Why is it so hard to get it right? I wonder what they will do when they reach the later episodes and try to invent new people's names and places and clothing brands. I would definitely stick with the English Manga version of Sailor Moon than the poorly adapted Smile version. I only gave one star because otherwise this review form woudln't work.
5,Sailor Moon Eternal Sleep,"In Eternal Sleep the Scouts go face to face with Jedite. Who will win? Will it be Sailor Moon or will it be Jedite? Some mysterious and cute guy named Maxfield Stanton shows up and the tennis player Katie and the owner of the park Mr. Baxter both get attacked by a monster. How could the Negaverse regroup so fast? The Scouts thought that Jedite was gone. Was he still out there? Find out what happens. Join Serena in her fifth novel, Eternal Sleep, based on the international blockbuster hit TV show, for more Action Adventure Romance Comedy and Fun."
4,Match Point for Sailor Moon,"Sorry about the pune, but it fits so well. It took five books but they finally got a winning combination. Less annoying advertisments and more entertainment. This book is the best one in this series, so far. I hope the next one keeps up the good work."
5,Always on time,"Dear Amazon...With my new Watch, I am always on time for my appoitments. Thanks for delivering my order on a record time.Regards..."
4,Great watch,"Took it diving this weekend. 3 dives, no problems. Does everything dive computer can.Love all the features. Like the other reviews, wish alarm was louder and wish it had a timer.Underwater alarm works great though when you are ascending too fast. Easy to hear that alarm and the flashing red led is a nice touch.Hard to read at night sometimes if it wasn't out during the day first.The illumination button only lights up led display for 2-3 seconds.Overall great watch and wouldn't hesitate to buy again."
3,Log not being saved,My watch is not saving any log dive it just has the original log dive that comes with it ! Ive been diing 3 times at i didnt saved any dive onnthe log ! Any help?
1,not what I bought....,"When you see the Look Inside session of this prouct, you can see tablature for the first song (So Far Away). But the book that arrived has simplified piano version, with no guitar tablatures...So.. if you want guitar tabs, DON'T BUY IT!! :)I also have to say that Amazon refund the item with no further questions, as I expected from a great book store that Amazon is. So I really belive it's just a matter of wrong pictures in the Look Inside session, that I hope will be solved soon."
2,No Guitar Tab,"Why anyone would publish a collection of Dire Straits without guitar tabs is beyond me, but this book does not have guitar tabs."
3,Interesting predecessor to _Star Maker_,"This novella-length meditation is even less of a novel than Stapledon's mind-blowing future histories, _Last and First Men_ and _Star Maker_.It's more of a set of philisophical essays, examining different world views from the same Way Cosmic perspective as _Star Maker_. (Stapledon _was_ a philosopher first and a novelist second. He'd be deeply puzzled by being remembered as an SF author.) It can even be looked at as a rough draft of that work.Completists may want to look for copies in used book stores. I don't think it's worth a special search unless you're a fanatic.Stefan Jones"
1,"Mulva, chocaolate syrup chump","If you want to see comedy and zombies in the same movie, stick with Troma, not this knock-off waste that isn't worth the time or money. I'm a fan of low-budget cinema, but this is crap on any budget.STAY AWAY!"
1,Ignore the Cover Photo!,"Just a warning: the woman on the cover of this DVD has nothing to do with either of the movies on the disc. Neither she nor anyone remotely resembling her appears in either of the 2 flicks. So don't be lured in by hopes for hot chicks in schoolgirl outfits killing zombies with big guns. These movies are the kind of thing you and your buddies might shoot on your college campus if you ran around with a camcorder for a few weeks. If you like buying fan-made videos at cons, you might go for these. Briefly, on that level, the main feature, ""Mulva"", is good for some silly laughs. The other feature, ""Filthy McNasty"", is more boring, although at least it has a little nudity near the end. Lastly, kudos to the filmmakers for falling in with the Troma gang."
1,Don't waster yer money,"This movie is a total waste of time and money, its badly edited, barely any gore, and the lead character is just down right irritating and never gets killed. The humor is crap and any connection to troma should be ignored as it seems just a ripoff scheme. Other crap films are much better, funny and drip with gore such as Zombie Doom (aka Violent S**T III)."
5,"If you like fan made horror, this is a movie for you.","The script are production quality on Mulva Zombie Ass kicker are awful, but the preformances are down right hysterical. Not for the squimish. Stand out preformances from the hysterical Missy Donatutti as the lisping heroine Mulva, Joe Anime as the poorly dubbed Tackateru and Troma regulars LLyod Kaufman, Debbie Roechon and Trent Haaga.Don't waste your time with the second feature Filth Mcnasty. It's downright dreadful."
3,Nordic Runes,"This is a very adequate book for people new to the runes, and in fact, I would even recommend it for those who have limited experience. The author gives solid, traditional descriptions of the runes and does a good job of explaining where he derives his meaning from by presenting the rune poems and applicable lore. In that regard, it is an excellent teaching tool for anyone who wants to delve into the primary sources.The problem that I have with this book is that the author breaks no new ground whatsoever, aside from a few spreads he explains in the final section. Thus, for those with even a little experience, everything you'll find should be old hat. As a previous reviewer stated, reversed runes are explained very poorly."
2,Did EA test this game before it was released?,"One can tell that much effort was put into game play, visual realism, and features. But after the game was ""put together"" did anyone at EA check to see how the final game played or if those features even worked?Because of a poorly planned player ratings (skills) system(including facilities that start poor and can only IMPROVE with time?), one is left to wonder why all their players perform more poorly with each passing game. -Thinking gamers beware.The interface is a mess, with player information scattered and not where you need it.Outrageous simulated scoring of players (Paul Kariya- 13 goals, 9 assists in 3 games) can crush your hopes of your star player ever topping the ratings.Also, players may still end up with 'twins' still playing on their previous team when you create a new team to replace another in the league. Horrible errors.It all leads to a major disappointment from EA."
5,Realistic hockey experience- as opposed to 2002,"The only NHL game I had spent lots of time on before 2004 was 2002. 2004 is a monstrous jump from 2002 in so many ways.Pros: You can activate fights when you want to- it doesn't just happen.Realistic skating, the glass breaks, goalie movements and saves are very real. The goalie can lose the puck in confusion and the players pass the puck around the boards like in real hockey.Has eliminated the ""magnet"" effect of 2002, where if the puck is near the goalie or a player it will automatically be attracted to the player's stick.Has also added charge up hit and the ability to aim your checks.Cons: There aren't any trading cards like in 2002"
2,SAME OLD GARBAGE,"Good game, but the same.Every year they make a new a NHL game, NHL 2000, NHL 2001, and so on.Its all the same, exept maby better graphics, and changed teams.This goes the same to Fifa, and other EA sports games.They basicly have the same idea.If you are gonna buy NHL 2004, dont waste youre money on NHL 2005, when it comes out, because its gonna be the same!My point is, if you buy NHL 2004, thats it dont buy next 1, wait a 1000 years and then buy a new 1 which will be NHL 3004 ;)So if you have NHL 2002 or 2003, dont get NHL 2004, its not worth the money.:-)"
2,disappointing,"I guess my three year old PC (complete with ATI video card) is obsolete, because this game looks like crap on it. I KNOW I'm not getting the full experience, since the fans DO look like cardboard cutouts, and it's impossible to see the lines on the ice.My two year old Microsoft Sidewinder is also now obsolete. Missing some functions.Overall, a very disappointing game. I guess if I want to get more out of it, I need to upgrade my system. This game will end up costing me a hell of a lot more than $50.I shoulda saved my money and kept NHL 2001."
1,this game sucks!,"oh no! there goes all the excitementI'd rather go back to playing NHL2001it actually has more options than 2004.This game is terrible..even though i've only played it for 5 minutes..i already know.The game play is really slow.They took away alot of fun features.The deflected shot, the back to back passing, Bill Clement,do i care who sings the songs? get rid of that stupid box!there is no more stat keeper for your self and your friendsdon't buy this..there's only disappointment."
5,A great read!,"This story offers terrific characters, a delightful love story, a fascinating plot, and excitment from the very first page. You'll love it and like me, you'll wish you could read it again for the very first time. Whatever you do, don't miss this one!"
3,chintzy,This was a replacement for an organizer I have been using for more than forty years. The dividers are nothing but paper and will probably not last more than one year.
1,Cheap coupon holder.,"I hate it, the coupon separators are paper, not cardboard. It is not what I expected, I paid waaaaay too much money for something I could have gotten at the dollar store."
1,Flimsy...poor quality,"The case of the item is not bad. The bad part are the index cards. They are made from the thinnest, cheapest paper possible. I thought maybe I'd take it to Kinko's or wherever and have the cards laminated but hopefully it won't cost too much. I realize this product is pretty inexpensive but I would have thought the actual cards would be a little better."
3,Wouldn't be so bad if Tabs were thicker!,"Item was ordered Dec 21, supposed to be here between Dec 28 and Dec 31st, but arrived Jan 6th. When I contacted the seller twice, he kept telling me that I could track it via FedEx, but the item was actually shipped via USPS. It arrived by USPS. The Tabs are nothing but paper so they don't work very well. I may have to spend money to buy better Tabs. I don't recommend this coupon organizer."
3,"Serviceable, Not Great","Dividers that come with it are just regular paper, not heavy card stock. This made it seem kind of lower quality. Works fine though."
2,Very poor quality,"Material is VERY thin, not as stiff as the plastic in a sheet protector, for example. The dividers are thin (Chinese) paper, not cardboard separators. They are also not as high as the coupons, so the flimsy paper (much flimsier than the coupons) is easily torn, bent, and crumpled into the bottom of the container. The organizer doesn't close squarely. I bought two at the same time, both were this way, so I guess it is an ""acceptable"" production flaw. In the past, I've had a vinyl coupon organizer with interior pockets and hard cardboard separators you could label. I'll keep looking for one of those. This isn't worth the money."
1,paper dividers.. seriously.,The so called dividers are JUNK! They are made of THIN paper...no more than a coupon itself! I'm mad I wasted money.
3,"Nice pouch, terrible dividers","I bought this product and I have to say that I am impressed by how many coupons the pouch can hold and the container itself. I was shocked to see how flimsy the dividers were, I will eventually have to replace them with my own card stock. Overall, great product, but be prepared to replace the dividers."
2,it was ok,this product was not as i expected. smaller than anticipated and was easy to get coupons in and out of it. some others may like but it was not what i was looking for.
2,coupon organizer,"In All fairness, I got what I paid for - the budget version. Good for starters, but most certainly will not hold up to repeated use."
3,You get what you pay for,"This coupon organizer will work, but I will need to purchase new dividers. The dividers that came with the coupon wallet are thinner than most paper. This will make it very difficult to flip through the tabs. This was very inexpensive, so I shouldn't have expected much. It will serve its purpose just fine once I get some better divider tabs. The actual wallet part is fine - a little cheap, but it is just for coupons."
3,Coupon organizer,"The coupon organizer was the size I needed. I thought the divider sheets were quite thin. The labels were supposed to be self-adhesive strips, but they fell off the backing. I had to tape them to the divider sheets."
2,very cheaply made,"I was hoping this organizer would be the same quality of one I lost, however the division sheets are only paper, not hard board or something more substantial. I don't think they will hold up at all."
1,Cheap and ineffective,"When I received this product, I was very disappointed. The inserts were made of regular paper, they are not stable enough to hold up to anything. I might as well have had no organizer at all. I have had to order another type of organizer. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,Do not order this,"I should have looked at the other reviews before I bought this but I was ordering other items from Amazon and decided to include this coupon holder. First of all, it is not wide enough to hold long coupons. Then the dividers are paper thin! I can't imagine that they would last long. Also, the shipping was almost as much as the coupon holder and to return it would even cost more. You could buy the same value at a Dollar store. How can Amazon keep selling this product with all the negative reviews?"
1,Coupon Organizer,cheap flimsy dividers that crumble everytime you try to put a coupon in looks like the dividers were cut out of notebook paper only thinner
1,Booooooo!,"Totally should have read the reviews on this... what a disappointment! Piece of junk really, worthless unless you want a new money holder because it won't work for coupons at all. No velcro either to strap it to the cart... glad I only paid like $5 - not worth my time to return"
1,TerribleI,Bought 3 of these. One for me and the others for x-mas stocking stuffers. Very inferior quality. Will not use the one I opened and the others I will donate to our churches thrift sale. Don't waste your money.
2,CHEAP....paper dividers,"It looked ok from the outside, but the coupon seperators are flimsy pieces of paper. I expected a little better.I would spend a little more for better quality. The picture looks better then what you receive."
3,"Okay, not great",I chose this because it was so cheap. The paper dividers are just too flimsy and i think plastic would be better
3,coupon holder,gave as a gift.haven't seen person who i gave it to to ask if she likes it or not.hopefully she does
2,Not my favorite,Mot my favorite. The index cards which separate each category are way too thin - not sturdy at all. I made my own by cutting up file folders to fit the organizer.
1,Coupon Organizer,The case or cover is fine. The dividers are very thin paper. Could have been better quality paper.
4,Coupon Organizer,"Overall a nice product. It is not too bulky and the outside material is durable. The only downfall, the divider sheets are too thin and flimsy. They a sturdier paper product to use to divide the sections. It is hard to grasp them swithing sections and they can easily rip."
3,"Good holder, but dividers aren't any good","While the coupon holder is nice, the dividers for coupons are extremely flimsy and I am sure will tear up in no time at all."
3,"It does what it's supposed to do, but could be better.","The coupon organizer works, but the inserts could be a lot sturdier. I ended up gluing pieces of 3x5 cards to the backs of them because they're so flimsy. It is nice to have the stickers so you can label the categories you would use them for. I guess I would add a couple more categories to it as well. But, all in all, it does what it's supposed to do. :)"
2,Not so organized,"Needed something to ""organize"" coupons. This wasn't it.The wallet is ok but it came with preprinted tabs that were supposed to be self stick. They were not. They just fell off the paper they were on. So I glued them on. They still are falling off. I guess you get what you pay for. It was $4.99.I try again for something better."
2,Not Big Enough,"I found the price of this item to be great, which is why I purchased it. Unfortunately though, it is not big enough to hold all of the coupons. I decided to supplement with another organizer and then just decided to ditch this one altogether as I couldn't use it effectively. Turns out I've seen similar organizers in physical stores for the same price or less (sometimes more) and what seems to be a better organizer."
3,Coupon holder,It works but is flimsy and too small. I wish it were a little bigger and the sections that separate them were thicker
4,Durable and slim,"This coupon book cover is durable and light. It's slim enough to fit in your back pocket or purse too! However, the dividers that come with it are literally paper thin and not durable. I strongly recommend either laminating them or purchasing alternative dividers. The labels that come with it are okay, but you may have to create some of your own. For example, they don't have a label for frozen foods. Yet they have a label for Dressings and one for Condiments (isn't that almost these same?)Overall, decent product. Worth the $3.00 I paid for it. Don't pay more than $6.00 for it though!"
2,Nothing like in the picture.,"The coupon organizer is very small. There is no way of installing it on the shopping cart, as shown on the picture. The dividers are just a flimsy piece of paper and sometimes difficult to find between the coupons."
1,Cheap dividers and TOO SMALL,"Don't bother with this. Pouch fabric is fine. But it's too small to hold large coupons, the ones that tend to span the width of a coupon page, as well as any that are even slightly on the tall side. And the dividers, as mentioned in previous reviews, are even flimsier paper than the coupons themselves! And, they are too short to be visible over the top of most coupons."
2,think about it,when I bought this item it was part of a order with many items- I did not realize that I would be charged a separate shipping charge to be shipped from the manufacture - it was a separate $5.00 shipping charge. When it arrived the dividers were flimsy paper - not even a heavy card stock - very flimsy paper - regular typing paper is heavier. However the outside holder is fine the Velcro works well and the fabric is nice.
1,Don't bother!,"I had a coupon holder like this years ago and someone lost it. I thought this would be the same thing. It is similar but it is worse. The coupon holder is not long enough. The things to separate the coupons are made of paper not something hard like cardboard. The coupon holder is not deep enough. Overall, I'm sorry I bought this."
1,Too Small to be of use,I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this organizer. It is too small to hold the coupons and extremely flimsy. There is indeed a separate shipping cost which is higher than the organizer is worth. Definitely don't bother.
3,A small moment during the Civil War,"A majority of the book deals with Colonel Nathanial Franklin's month-long furlough and his encounters with different people. The time is around the autumn of 1864. One of his encounters is with the Crittendon family, whose fate will become entangled with his own. The pacing is good and you come to care about the characters and what happens to them. A very good book."
4,(Almost) A Cult Classic,What shocked me about Killer Condom was that it exceeded its low-budget expectations with a surprisingly intelligent and touching love story. So the effects weren't up to much? Pa! The central romance between hard-boiled detective Udo Samel and pretty-boy rent boy Marc Richter was genuinely affecting; the dialogue was spot-on and Martin Walz's direction (and Samel's performance in particular) were beautifully judged.
2,Killer Condom Blows!,"First off, the lame subtiles will drive you crazy. If your into homosextual situations then this movie is for you. I know it's Troma, but come on this is lame. Look for it used, don't spend over $7.00 for it."
1,Disappointed.,Awful movie. It was not remotely funny and was actually pretty uncomfortable to watch. I was extremely disappointed with it as were my friends. The DVD quality was also terrible.
4,Hilarious Romantic Mystery,"Bubbles in Trouble the second `bubble' book and you take a trip to Amish County to uncover a murder, bad land deals and drugs. Bubbles Yablonsky goes undercover which means no spandex, no showers and no makeup. The growing relationship with Bubbles and Stiletto is sweet and scrupulous. If you enjoy Jennifer Cruise or Janet Evanovich's then take a chance on the `Bubble Series'."
3,Pretty good.,"While this book was entertaining and fun, I didn't like it as much as Bubbles Unbound. It was still definately worth the read. Bubbles is great - especially when bathing a cow!"
3,"Puts the ""Meh"" into mediocre.","Lately my email inbox has been assaulted with millions of emails saying ""OMFG THIS IS THE SCARIEST HALLOWEEN MOVIE EVA"" and what not. I rented this today, and this is abit scary, but not the best and very mediocre!The movie begins in the mortuary and a pagan cult is giving birth to a baby. Later, while Tom is narrating, a pagan symbol is drawn on the babys chest, and the woman grabs her baby and hoes to hide in a hospital, then hides in a barn, where she is killed. 20 minutes later, the plot gets moving (finally), and we see the life of a troubled family, and on halloween, a party is held, and a pair of friends hides and has sex in the myers' house when they get killed.Now, The woman has to protect her son! There's the good, the bad, and the guilty pleasures, then this movie.For fans only, I guess."
3,"""Not Bad Halloween Sequel!""","Donald Pleasence and Paul Rudd star in this 1995 horror sequel.Dr. Loomis tries to stop Michael from making his final sacrifice.This is not a bad sequel, but I think it could've been better.I recommend the ""Producer's Cut"", it explains more, showsmore of Donald's scenes and has a better finale. This dvdhas decent picture and sound, but no extras. I'd still addthis to your Halloween or horror collection."
3,Tell me just one thing,"I am a bog haloween fan... have all the movies and everything, but why is that, that in halloween 4, 5, 6, Jamie Loyd is Laurie Strodes Daughter, and that in H20 she is not anywhere.. no pictures .. nothing!!"
3,"The scariest, but far from the best","When I was in the seventh grade my Dad took me to go see this film at the theatre. I think I was emotionally traumatized for about a week after seeing it because it was so scary and all of the killings were soooooo violent. I did not even really focus on the plot that much because I was so terrified. When it finally came out on video I puchased a copy and watched it again and realized how dumb the plot was. The director obviousley knew what he was doing because Micheal Meyers was the scariest in this film but who ever wrote it should be ashamed. I guess they kind of had to clear up the dirty work of Halloween 5 (the worst) with the plot, dealing with that man in black coat, boots, and hat freeing meyers from jail at the end."
1,"Come home Jason Vorhees, all is forgiven.","One of the worst of a bad lot. Boasting merit for an explanation behind Michael Myers(and the explanation is so lame, you'll think you could make a better one with a ten second brainstorming session),this inscipient slasher offers absoloutley no scares, surprizes, thrills, or even laughs. You can predict exactly when, where, and how the killer will make his appearence with 90% accuracy. This movie doesn't contain an ounce of life. I suppose you could watch it if you're really bored and would like a laugh, but don't tell me I didn't warn you!"
2,The curse!!,"I really hate giving halloween movies low stars, but what can you do when you got a movie like this. This movie isnt the most terrible, crapiest, dumbest movie i have ever seen. Oh no, it had its parts. But lets get down to the point the direction wasnt great, and the script wasnt awesome. It just could have been a lot better with the story they were shooting for(most of the story is set in the producers cut)."
2,two stars for donald pleasence's final acting role but none for this piece of junk,donald pleasence died shortly after finishing this film and because of his long acting chops and talent i gave him two stars for this movie. the movies is junk and not worth any stars and at half price it is still half to much to pay. not ant good at all.
2,Go for the Producer's Cut,"This Is Not Good For The Fact It Doesnt Explain Much How did Jamie end up in the place where we open up and who inpregnated Jamie In the Alternate version ""the producer's cut"" we open up to a Flashback at the ending of Halloween 5 showing the Man in Black kidnapping Jamie and Michael Also it reveals that Michael impregnated Jamie ""I Know I was shocked Too"" and we find out what happened to Dr.Loomis and Michael at the End of the Regular Version"
1,READ TO UNDERSTAND WHY I RATED IT SO LOW,Ok this version there selling here on amazon is horrible and I give it 1 star. If you want to see an excellent addition to the halloween series i suggest you check EBAY for the producers cut of this film. That version was reshot with the original script that was planned for this movie. But because of many rewrites this version on amazon was changed so drastically it lost all storyline and became a really bad slasher. So instead of getting this go to Ebay and get Halloween-The Curse of Michael Myers The Producers Cut
1,Bad...(* 1/2),"There is not much to say about this film except that it is bad, bad, bad. The only other thing I can say about it is that Paul Rudds performance was ridiculous. Also that the box art is too good for this crappy film, so don't be fooled by how good it looks. However, im still interested in seeing the uncut version. NOT reccomended."
3,"Good, but you have pick through a lot of junk","I saw this movie in the local video store. I heard about it, but I didn't have any ambition to see it until I saw the DIMENSION logo on the side of the box. I decided to give it a chance because most of their movies are really PHAT. It was really boring for a while. Then it got a little better as it went along. Overall, I'd say this was worth the renting money. The kills were good and most of the acting was excellent. I have to say I didn't like the part when the kid pulls a knife on his dad. Save that for Children of the Corn Part 6. If you disect this, you'll like it better."
3,pretty good but some of the parts are just.....strange.,"this one is a really good halloween movie with good music,too.but there was just that guy in a black suit was supposed to scare people? but who it turned out to be was kinda cool."
3,The Curse of Michael Myers,"I thought this one was a good adaptian to the trilogy. This one brings back old characters and sets a front a good storyline. The acting isnt bad and in a way scary. The story of this one is based all in the name. This one is about the Curse of Michael Myers of hime returning to Haddonfield, Illinois and killing a plethora amount of people and searching for jaime Loyd and her baby. The movie is well worth to buy and is scary and freakish and i must say pretty gory. I think this one is one of the bests in the series and lives on the legend and curse of Michael Myers."
1,The worst of the series...,"I love the Halloween movies. I even love all of the sequals, including number 3, and have written many positive reviews for them. I had been wanting to see this FOREVER, but the video store in my small town doesn't have it. I joined an online rental service and this was the 4th movie that came. I was so disapointed, words can not describe it. I would have turned it off, but I kept hoping it would star to make sense, get scary, etc. Nope, none of these. I would suggest going from 5 right to H2O, because even though H2O is great, it's premise is that 4-6 never happened."
2,A GREAT SLASHER MOVIE! A BAD HALLOWEEN MOVIE!,"It's not as bad as people say it is, but definatly copuld have been better. It is way to gory, when Halloween movies aren't supposed to be. There are also way too many killings. The death count is around 18, when the Producer's Cut version of the movie only had 8. There is also the stupid subplot of the Man In Black and Thorn which is Michael's evil. The Producer's Cut explains a lot more. It is gory, it is a kill-fest, and the plot is weak-- (thanks a lot Halloween 5, you just destroyed the series. All in all, though, it is teh perfect slasher movie, but it not a good Halloween entry, bu tthis movei is a good way to waste two hours."
1,A real piece of garbage,"What a disgrace to John Carpenter. The original ""Halloween"" was the greatest horror movie ever made. How could this stupid, unimaginative, confusing mess be allowed to share the name ""Halloween""? Who is responsible for this travesty of taste? Who wrote this story, a first grader? This movie has the dumbest ending I have ever seen. How could this terrible movie have made it into theatres? Doesn't someone screen movies? Someone needs to be held accountable for this and needs to be punished very severely."
1,Halloween: The worst of Michael Myers,"This movie is so blloody and stupid. The plot of the movie is dumb, Theres way too much blood. The only good Halloween mopvies were Halloween,Halloween 2, Halloween H20 and Halloween ressurection. Halloween the curse of michael myers is the dumbest and worst movie is ever saw. Listen to me dont rent ro buy his movie! Ive seen alot of good movies in my lide but this is terrible."
1,It should've ended with HALLOWEEN II,"as i am typing this review a HALLOWEEN 8 (?!!?) is in the works.why bother? whatta nightmare seeing this 6th chapter as michael myers skewers, slaughters, and disembowels everyone in sight (oh yeah, he crushes 1 guy's head thru a steel gate). there's also the horror cliche of an empty hospital and an empty bus station WHERE NO ONE KEEPS GUARD and it is just myers chasing his prey (why put a baby in jeopardy? a new low there). it was umcomfortable seeing donald pleasance in this, his last film. he was very ill during filming and it really shows with his voice painfully screechy and his standing uneven. a mess all around!"
2,Halloween Seems To Be Growing Up,"Michael has changed. No more stalking, no more surprise scares, no more suspense. All michael does is brutally slaughter people. Even the ones trying to protect him. Whats his deal? Halloween seems to have reached the hardcore stage. At this rate, Michael Myers would be a bloody good match for the Terminator."
2,6th is my least favorite,"well halloween 6 is o.k. but my least favorite in the series. too gory, and too much killing. still, it finally gives more information on michael's motives. if you dont like slasher flicks this isnt for you though, my friend a DIE HARD halloween fan can not watch this one, or halloween 2."
3,way better than H20 but not very good,"i absolutly hate part 2,3,5(except the ending) and H20. gheezus! take a good idea and beat on it till nothings left why don't you! i don't like evil druid micheal, i won't my old pyscho with butcher knife and no motive for killing back! oh well, donald pleasence, as always, outdoes everyone in this movie. there are two versions of this film, this one and the producer's cut which is very hard to find but is out there, hopefully we will see it on the dvd. i give this version 2 stars and producer's cut 4. producer's cut explains what made no sense in this one and some character's live longer. its ok, i'm a little undecided on it but its waaaaay better than H20!"
3,The Darkest Halloween Ever!,I just saw the alternate version of this and it clearly makes sense what happens to Dr.Loomis at the end. Definitely a evil and sinister feeling to this entry. Based on druid beliefs and how Myers is connected with the curse of thorn. Highly recommended. 3 1/2 stars. Alternate uncut version 4 stars.
3,"Good, but why the gory murders?","Halloween 6 isn't bad, it is actually one of the scariest ones in the serious. But what prevents this movie from a perfect score is the extremley gory scenes (in one part, a guys head blows up!). I suggest at least a rental."
2,The worst Halloween ever!,"This is by far the worst Halloween of them all. Compared to the original director's cut of this movie, this cut is a disgrace to everyone involved in and with the movie. This version is just a mindless boring slasher film. When will Dimension admit their horrible mistake and release the original director's cut."
4,Pretty Scary!,"I thought this was a pretty good movie. I think it's one of the scariest in the series, but it's a little different from the others. This one get's more into what made Michael the way he is. I think this is a very interesting movie to watch, and I like how they brought back Tommy Doyle."
3,Average,"Its no doubt that the Halloween trilogy has gone downward after the sequel, and this one, though making some attempt, just doesn't cut it.Picking up some years after the ending of part 5, The Curse of Michael Myers has our buddy Mike going after his neice's son. Whats good about the flick is that it gives some explanation as to why he has the nerve to wipe his family off the planet. Its not too good of a reason, but it sheds some light on some previously unexplainable things. Myers goes all out in this one, taking bloody murders to a whole new level as he breaks necks, slices juglars, and makes heads explode (literally). The violence in the movie is kinda too much, but when you think about it, how many scary films don't have blood and gore? Not much. Still though, the movie is overall just average and doesn't live up to this once oh so great series. At the most, its a weekend rental."
1,Short Review,"Definitely this is the worst Michael Meyers Halloween movie (of the originals, leaving out Rob Zombie movies). Not only is it slow paced, but just so 90's and unoriginal. The kid, Tommy, in this movie is obsessed with Michael and does the whole locked in his room and has every article ever written on him thing. Always looking out his room with his bionoculars. Such nonsense. After like a week he would get bored of that. But this kid has done it for like 10 years. Not only that, but Jaime was apparently dirty and was having a baby. Also, I don't like how Michael was caught by a satanistic cult, nor about the whole thing with aligning his evil to the stars. The whole movie is just nonsense. Really. This movie and the Rob Zombie Halloween 2 movie..just...no."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"If you can locate the producers cut of this movie I here thats better. What we have here is a mess. I am sure that if John Carpenter has watched this he would just laughed at this mess! The story goes in a direction that makes the sequel such a turkey. If your new to the HALLOWEEN MOVIES watch HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN II skip parts 3-6 (as the producers did when they made H20) then watch Halloween H20 and then skip Halloween 8. This is mandatory watching to see how not to make sequel."
1,NOT THE TRUE HALLOWEEN!!!,"4 WAS BAD...5 WAS TERRIBLE...but THIS?!This is on a whole new scale of wrong...The true Halloween was a story about Micheal killing people, BUT mainly after Jaimie Lee Curtis...The true Halloween movies star Jaimie Lee...(1, 2, H20, Resurrection)The True Halloween movies don't have a ""dark satanic cult"" in them...(i mean...and gang of evil druids...really people?)The True Halloween movies don't have some insane, half mute, little girl who grows up and gets raped by Micheal Myers so that he can have a child to sacrifice to said ""satanic cult""...and don't even get me started on the ""Man in Black"" stuff...It was a monotonous conclusion to a ""trilogy"" of ""sub-plot"" films that should have never entered the world or Micheal Myers and his reign of terror on Halloween...Long live John Carpenters' original vision of true terror and evil!"
2,"two stars for the late donald pleasence , but no stars for this hopeless mess that trashes the good name of the ""halloween""","donald pleasence died not long after the filming of this movie and it is sad that the great actor left this mess as his last film.once again he is dr.lommis, the mad ahab, looking for the white whale of michael mayers,aka the boogyman, once more.the original concept has been streached about as far as it can and not break, so nothing new just your typcal slasher movie kills and some nonsence about the curse that makes our friend (or fiend if you like) kill. it's al to much to late to save this tired and really silly film. a sad fairwell to the great donald pleasence!!"
3,"Interesting, but you should check out the Producer's Cut!!!!","An okay transfer of the movie on a bare-bones DVD.Unfortunately, the makers of this disc decided NOT to include the alternate version that contains VERY interesting deleted and alternate scenes.Check out the differneces here:http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/h/halloween6-pcr.htmlHopefully a Special Edition of this film will be released that will feature both the Theatrical and Producer's Cut versions of this film."
4,Good enough,Man this is clasic slasher movie making at work. Mike runs around does tons of damage and kills people. If you like the others this will fit right in your collection. It's not as scarry as the original but it has great gore factor.
2,This movie doesn't even compare to its predecessors.,"The movie is not nearly as good as the first one. This one has a little gore, but the gore that it has is somewhat unrealistic. Like the part where Michael Myers picks up the father and puts him against a fuse box and his head explodes. The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the Halloween movies have a good name to protect."
2,THIS MOVIE SUCKS,"I liked it much better when Michael Myers was just a lunatic who would not die. They really lose sight of what this series is about and the plot line is just plain weak. The only redeeming value I found in this movie is Dr. Loomis, but the rest of it is rather pathetic. H20 is much better than this."
3,Halloween 6,"Many people think this is the worst Halloween sequal but I disagree. Halloween H20 was the worst sequal ever. That wasn't even Michael Myers!!! Anyways Halloween 6 is very interesting sequal. This moive explains why Michael never dies,and why he he is trying to kill his family. This sequal also has its boring points. Check this movie out if your a true Halloween fan. Its worth seeing believe me."
5,Top Shelf,"Great addition to the series. Dr. Loomis is still trying to stop the ""Evil on 2 Legs"".Much fun.Also, Paul Rudd...before he was funny."
3,"Weird, to say the least","By far the most far-fetched halloween of them all. A little too much for me but at times was entertaining. This one explains who the man in the boots was helping him through part 5. It revolves around this cult that completley backs him and now Myers isnt a psychotic killer anymore, he is a god. This one bent the rules and the story way too much to completley enjoy it. I only own it to complete my halloween collection. Only buy or rent if you are a hardcore fan."
4,Halloween 6 rating,Halloween 6 is pretty cool i liked the man in black idea and that michael had a child. and i think they should make the child be the killer in 8 since they are making a number 8. but in halloween 6 they had some pretty sweet deaths and it was cool. c-ya bye
1,ATTENTION HOLLYWOOD,"THIS FILM HAS A DIRECTORS CUT WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE 100 TIMES BETTER THEN THE PROCUCER'S SLASHED VERSION! WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE RELEASE THIS ON DVD! HALLOWEEN 6 IS AN AWEFUL FILM, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE READ, THE DIRECTOR'S CUT IS EXCELLENT. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUT IT ON THE SHELVES FOR THE TRUE FANS TO SEE."
3,Okay but disappointing.,"I need to say that a am a big halloween fan, so I like all of the movies, but I must say that this movie's theatrical release was quite disappointing. The plot is very confusing and takes place 6 years after Halloween 5. The first bad move is to hire some one else besides Danielle Harris to play Jaime. I don't want to get to far into but such bad moves follow. I have seen the Producer's Cut and I must say that is a much better film. It is still not the best but makes a lot more sense and is actually enjoyable. The acting in this movie is okay, I keep thinking, 'Why was this green lit???' I gave it 3 stars because there was good music, some good camera shots, and because it is a halloween film!"
4,A great Michael Myers movie,"Alot of peaple didnt like this one but i disagree.I loved this one,its worth watching again last time i saw it was in June.I really wanna see it again.Alot of peaple said this was the worst one but i disagree, Halloween 3 was it sucked, Michael was not even on their. I loved the part when Tommy kicks Michaels ass.Like a 17 year revenge. Last time we saw Tommy is when he was little, he was on the first one, but Tommy is like 22 and he finally got his hands on Michael. If u didnt see this Halloween yet, rent it or buy it, its worth watching."
3,The curse of Michael Meyers,"Michael Meyers has never been scarier!! While this movie wasnt the best of the series I can honestly say that next to the original it is the creepiest. the music, mask, & the idea of the curse of thorn makes this movie a must have for ""halloween"" fans!"
3,Creepy,"Finally, a Halloween movie that captures the ""evil"" persona that Dr. Loomis constantly makes reference to in the previous Halloween movies. This movie highlights the ghoulish appearance and satanic nature that Michael Myers should exude. Not a great-GREAT movie but it will entertain and [really scare you good]. The biggest flaw is that Michael is a bit too evil that he tends to come off a lil' Jason Vorhees-ish. The movie does not show Michael's human side. ""You know"", driving, hiding, reading etc. But part 6 is far better than part 5. Atleast on substance."
1,A waste of time and film.,"This movie is dull. It is the worst Halloween film I've seen and I have not even seen all of them yet (I have only seen 1,2,4,5, and this one). In fact, I only saw 15 minutes of this and turned it off and then saw the rest of it and regretted it. Skip this and stick with the aforementioned installments. The only saving grace is Donald Pleasence, who turns in his final performance, but it isnt much of one (a saving grace, that is)."
2,True fan,"this movie wasn't terrible, BUT are we really supposed to believe that Michael is tied in with a druid cult? I don't think so! The 1st Halloween worked so well because of it's lack of gore and it was very suspenseful. Now, it seems the more gore a movie has, the scarier it is. What a shame. True fans of Halloween will agree with me. Not ""hardcore fans"" who like a movie with blood and guts but no plot. The man in black turned out to be Dr. Wynn. Who in the hell is this guy? He is in the original for about 5 seconds and now pops up all of the sudden? And where in the hell was Tommy Doyle at in Parts 4 &5? If he is so obsessed with Michael, then how come we don't see him until now? And you mean to tell me that the Strode family is living in the Myers house and don't EVEN know it's the Myers house? If you really want to be entertained, watch Halloween 1, 2 and H20. H20 does us all a favor and pretends parts 4, 5,and 6 don't exist. you should to and forget this one!"
2,"all trick, no treat","I have been a fan of the Hallween series every since the original was released in 1978. I try to give sequels as much credit as possible. Halloween's 2,3,&4 were respectable sequels that helped keep the franchise going for two decades. However, Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers is one I would rather forget about. This is the worst sequel in the series just behind Halloween 5. The beginning is vague and pointless while the ending is a complete disaster. The movie thrives on extreme gore, which is not something Halloween has used in the past. The original is practically bloodless and yet considered a classic. The film tries to introduce a reason behind Michael Myers' evil ways which only complicates the story even more. One good thing about this film is that it can be left out of the series and you wouldn't even miss it. Trust this Halloween fan, this movie stinks from beginning to end. Thank goodness Steve Minor was able to salvage the series with Halloween H20!"
3,Scary & Weird Edition to the Series...,"Don't get me wrong...I liked this film. There are some really scary scenes. When I say scary, I mean I had to force myself to watch them. The beginning scene is one of the most intense chase scenes I've ever seen. Michael is incredibly scary in this film, more so than the others for some reason. The only thing I really don't like is the whole Thorn thing. It's something about some old curse...I don't know. It's really weird and all the cult people are too strange for my liking. I guess it can be overlooked with the great scares and intense chases, but still...its a little too far out there for me..."
2,Argh!,"I am a huge Halloween fan, but even I was disappointed with this entry. It made me believe that, had he lived, Donald Pleasence would have appeared in Halloween XXIII. The guy would make any movie, and for Halloween all he needs is the overcoat and a gun, so he can run around screaming, 'HE HAS RETURNED! HE IS EVIL INCARNATE!' Gotta love Donald, though. Anyway, this flick is a clinker. We waited 6 years for this! Doh! Pure cheese."
2,I'm CLUELESSLY in love with Paul!,"Good movie. Scary enough for me and it has Paul Rudd from CLUELESS in it. If that doesn't make this worth seeing, than don't see it. I don't care what you do. He really knows how to raise a baby. So endearing. That single mother doesn't have to worry about being single anymore!"
3,"KINDA WEIRD,BUT SCARY","I CAN SEE WHY THIS MOVIE ONLY GOT 1&1/2 STARS.CAUSE MOST OF THE MOVIE WAS KINDA STRANGE AND GORY.BUT I LIKED IT.IT USED TO BE MY FAVORITE MOVIE.BUT AFTER YOU SEE IT ABOUT 50 TIMES LIKE I HAVE IT GETS ANNOYING.BUT I STILL WATCH IT THOUGH.I DONT KNOW WHYBUT I DO.STILL,THIS MOVIE'S WORTH SEEING ONCE.ITS GREAT FOR SOME BUT A WASTE OF TIME FOR OTHERS"
2,This is the kind of movie that causes remakes.,"Thank God H20 was released and saved this series, for a bit, because Halloween Cure of Michael Myers is the worse Halloween movie of the series. Halloween 5 was even better than this one. Although if you ignore the story and only watch Michael do his thing, he is quiet violent and should please slasher fans on that level. Other than this, the whole ""Michael kills because of a cult,"" is way to cheesy. I think Jason Voorhees being brought back to life by lightening (Friday the 13th, part 6) was more serious than this. Blamming a cult is so cliché, and has been done to many times.So if you are a huge fan or the series, buy it for your collection. If you only like the first two, or the new ones, stay away from this one."
1,i hate moustapha akkad,"DO NOT see this. it sucks. it is wretched. it has no suspense, all the characters suck, and the thorn thing, what the F@$#! it was scarier when michael just killed his family for no apparent reason. just skip this trash along with 4,5,6 and ressurection. stick with the first two and you can't go wrong. H2O wasn't bad either. and season of the witch is good, just don't expect myers to be in it. watch it as if it was NOT part of the halloween series and you will have fun."
2,Not a good addition to the Halloween series,"I suppose this movie was ok but only because of Donald Pleasance, but the fact that they made Michael Myers some kind of demon was outrageous. I liked Myers more than any other famous slasher because he was actually a human. No they made him into a demon? Crazy. I would not buy it, I would only rent it for the sole purpose that it is Donald Pleasence's last performance. One last thing, they substited real scares for blood and gore. The original was by far, the scariest and it had little to no onscreen violence. I would reccomend Halloween: H20 instead of Halloween 6. Halloween H20 delievers the real scares."
2,it aint that bad,ok look michael myers is my fav ceriel killin dude or watever they call it in that genre. when i saw the movie it really is a waste of time. its not very good at all compared to other halloween movies. and for horror fans this movie is not worth time. it aint scary. after tha movie was over i was like ...... is that a halloween movie?? but for serious fans like me for this series u must atleast c it once although its not good. and its about time that old guy dies. the ending was also crummy. tha only good part is wen tha guy gets electricuted. i wouldve gave this movie 3 stars instead of 2 but on tha front cover it said best halloween movie ever. so i gave it a score lower for quoting stupid stuff.
1,The Worst In The Series,"Halloween 6 is by far the worst in the series. It ties him in with the druids, and tells how he becomes motivated to kill. Horribly made. Donald Pleasence looks like Santa! You can just see him looking out into the audience saying ""This is awful."" Also, I haven't seen this much gore or killing in a long time. I think more people die in this movie, than in 1, 4, & H20 combined! This movie is similar to ""Halloween 2"" in the gore catergory. This movie is also only really good if you haven't seen any of the others, but know the story line."
2,"Halloween, Shmalloween","Michael Myers is back and once again, he's chasing after his niece who is all grown up and with child. After killing her, he follows the track of her baby, leading him back to the town of Haddonfield. It sounded like a good idea at the time. The last installment to feature Donald Pleasence, who died after the making. Goes along smoothly before sub plot about druid ceremonies and cults start rearing their ugly faces back into the series (part III). By no means the best."
2,Not As Bad as Halloween 3,"Okay , this is the not the worst of the Halloween movies , but it is the worst of the ones with Michael Myers in them. Curse of Thorn ? give me a break , the origin of the shape was given in Halloween 2. When Loomis is on his way out fo town watch it !! and as for jamie's age difference ? the narrarator said that she dissapeared 10 years ago which makes her 21 in this movie. If your a Halloween fan and have the others buy this one too , your collection is never complete without all of the series."
5,I think this movie rocks,I thought this movie was extremely well thought out with a good storyline. Michael is able to put heart stopping terror into each one of his gruesome killings. I was sad to see Jamie die. I reccomend this movie to horror fans. Donald Pleasance kicks @$$.
4,"""In the producer's cut form, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers could have been the best of the Halloween series to that date","When you buy this movie, but the producer's cut (bootlegged) online. Search it on Google, you can find it VERY cheap (6 bucks cheap). Michael Myers is amazing in this movie (both cuts) and is one of the scariest. The actors are great and it includes a new storyline that Michael Myers is controlled by a cult. I LOVE the idea of a cult controlling Michael Myers. Overall this movie is great. If you can get the producers cut though, its A LOT BETTER.3/5 for the THEATRICAL4/5 for the PRODUCER'S CUT"
1,Horrible Sequel,Before Dimension got smart with their horror movies they tried to reive the Halloween franchise. Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers was an already dead horror franchise. The cast here is horrible and the deciison to kill of the charcter of Jamie was stupid. The film does have some decent kills but it lacks some good old fashioned T&A and the plot was all over the place. Skip this one.
3,sAM's review on Halloween 5,"Hiya every1 it's sam hear id like 2 tel ya abit about halloween 6. Im a massive fan of michael myers an this film gets no credit. Of herd that this was the worset film in the series. Thats not true.Michael returns and doesnt disapoint in my opinoin. I have to say that some of the acting is ""cheesy"" but overall a great friday night movie. Lots of killings and very jumper as well.This dvd is deff worth buyin it's a film u deff wud watch agen. The only thing i wud change in the film wud be the ending.sAM Mullett thanks 4 ur time (LONG LIVE MICHAEL MYERS)"
2,Dumb!,The Curse is the follow-up to #5. Although it did have its scary I thought the plot was too hard to follow.I think they should of just left out that cult guy in the 5th one and never made this one. This and Halloween 3 are the worst to me. I would suggest all of the other Halloweens.
2,You must be mistaken. I thought I was renting Halloween 6!,An episode of the teletubbies pretending to be a horror film. This movie was just about as scary as an episode of the teleteletubbies! Stupid and Boring. Avoid this movie! Even fans of the Halloween films won't be remotely amused.
3,Superb Scares!,"Kids in trouble, devil worshippers on the run... those are some of the sub-plots of (Halloween- The Curse Of M. Myers).Michael returns to put an end to his remaining relatives who came to live in his old home (Hmmm!). . . A lot of gore won't save this flick from being a total flop!By the way, Michael Myers unfortunate niece gets butchered in this one, finally."
3,Same-o Same-o,This movie was pretty good. It continues the story of Michael Myers trying to kill his niece which he finally succeeds in dooing however she has a kid of her own so Michael goes looking for the baby in Hadonfield on the night when they finally think it's safe to come out and play and celebrate Halloween. Turns into another bloodbath (although not nearly as many were killed)!
1,Halloween 6 is Horrible!!!!!!!!,Absolutely dumb! There was a storyline you couldnt follow and the gore was lame in the parts you thought were gonna be the best. Good actors but a horrible movie....
1,Horrible,"I try to pretend this movie(along with part 3) don't exist in the Halloween series. It is AWFUL. They really messed the series up big time with this one. First of all, a lot of things don't make any sense. Who is supposed to be the father of Jamie's baby? What is up with the ending altogether?? Who is that screaming? I think what makes this film so bad is that they killed Jamie off. Then they introduced some characters that no one really cares about or would even remember. Tommy Doyle? Who would remember him unless you are a big fan of the original? Laurie's aunt and uncle from her adopted family? Gimmie a break! This plot was way too farfetched and ruined the series."
4,halloween five,"movie was made very wellit keep the storyline going, just continuedas it wasn't no. five in the series"
2,Bad Movie,i love the halloweens but this one is the worst one (besides 3) yet 2 many deaths that didnt mean anything this one is one you should pass up
2,THIS LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD'VE WENT STRAIGHT TO VIDEO,"IN THIS ONE, MICHAEL MYERS FINALLY KILLS HIS NIECE, BUT THAT'S NOT THE END, HE'S NOW LOOKING TO KILL HER BABY. THIS IS A HUGE IMPROVEMENT OVER #5 BUT THAT'S NOT SAYING MUCH. THIS MOVIE IS BORING MOST OF THE TIME, AND DONALD PLEASANCE REALLY LOOKS BORED THIS TIME AROUND. THE WAY THIS ONE WENT, THIS COULD'VE WENT STRAIGHT TO VIDEO. SADLY, THIS WOULD BE DONALD PLEASANCE'S LAST APPEARANCE AS DR. LOOMIS AND IT WOULD ALSO BE HIS LAST FILM EVER. HE DIED SHORTLY AFTER THIS MOVIE WAS COMPLETE. R.I.P. DONALD PLEASANCE. YOU DESERVED MUCH BETTER FOR A MOVIE THAT WAS GONNA BE THE LAST OF YOUR CAREER AND LIFE."
2,curse of the producers missing cut,"I've seen both versions and suggest skipping them both (along with Halloween 5) unless you just can't help yourself.Pros for ""The Curse of Michael Myers"": better pacing; some of The Shape's (George Wilbur's) more intimidating moves are in the ""new"" ending which makes up the last 17 minutes of this version.Pros for ""The Producer's Cut"": I personally enjoyed the ""origin"" of Michael Myers presented in this version (even though the movie was slow); although I felt really bad about Dr. Loomis' fate at the end, I enjoyed Michael's escape.Neither origin really adds much to the story line and the end of the theatrical version is pathetic. At the end of The Producer's Cut you may wonder if Michael is off to continue his pranks or is done killing. Guess H20 answered that question...Happy Halloween"
1,Yuck! Stupid Movie!,"This is one of the worst films ever made. The story and characters are so unbeliveable and evn worse, as other reviewers stated, there are scenes in a DVD that is not availible on Amazon that are not present here! That is so stupid! Can't studios nowadays make a decent definitive edittion of a movie. Take my advice and stick with the true Halloween trilogy: 1, 2, and 7. Enough said."
4,Can we say high point?,"Besides parts 1 and 2, part six is by far the best installment yet. I think that fans haven't given this one a chance because it's a little different then the light hearted part 4 and almost comedic part 5. Halloween 6 is dark and scary. The DVD lowers my movie rating by a half star. No extras were available, no deleted scenes from the 2 hour long director's cut were even added, no trailers, no behind the scenes, no teaser trailers, no sneek peak at the directors cut, no production notes, no commentary, no 2.35:1 widescreen, not even fully restored! This DVD looks exactly like my VHS except the blacks look more solid during the night scenes. Overall, good movie, terrible DVD, wait for New Line or Anchor Bay to release the 2 disc director's cut special edition, that will be worth the G's, ..."
3,This is not the original version.,"This version of Halloween 6 has been cut up sumpin' fierce by Joe Chappelle...using Micheal's own knife! I won't say what scences were changed for Joe's release of H6. I will say that the original producer's cut is so much better. Unfortunately, it has never been OFFICIALLY released."
5,A good Halloween - Très bon film,"Bonjour, chez moi en france Michael Myers fait parti des grand ""serial-killer"" des film d'horreur tel Jason Vorrhies ou encore Freddy Krugger mais Michael Myers est celui qui me touche le plus avec sa recherche perpetuelle de l'mour de sa soeur Laurie. Cette série de films est l'une des plus grande et des plus intérressante et surtout la première du genre écrite par un maitre du fantastique Mister John Carpenter.Un must à posséder absolument."
1,Halloween 6 : made by people who don't care...,"This is what happens when producers stop careing about a horror film series. You get quite a lot: A sub-par story, miserable photography, and a lot of gore, which I believe was put there to take your mind off of how sorry every other aspect of the film is. Plesence looks as though he doesn't even want to be involved with the film. When I saw this in the theater, It was a serious disapontment. watching it at home can't be much better. If you want to see a good sequel, Buy Halloween 2."
4,One of the better Haloween parts,"While part 5 was on the screen, I nearly fell asleep because there was nothing special and the film was absolutely boring. This one is by far better and has some creepy scenes ( like Michael getting his car ). The plot was also something new to the series, a pity that Micheals connection to Heathen Culture wasn't picked up at H2O. The End is also pretty cool and Micheal butchering the whole worshippers at once instead of lurking after them in ten minute long scenes was also a release. The shocking effects suceed, they aren't as pathetic and lame as in part 5. If you are a fan of the Halloween series this is more essential than the last two ones and has the most interesting story. There are some lowpoints in this movie but they don't matter if you are looking for a good slashing time."
2,Scary. But that is it.,In the 6th of this series Mike is back (And with a differentmask again) to kill his Family. This time he has targeted theStrodes. A Jerry Springer family that consists of a knife wheilding son a Psycho father a Gang member brother and a Stupid but nice mother. Scary. But nothing more. It fails to give Halloween any dignity and disgraces Michael Myers by linking him to the druids. Worth a rent and a must for fans. Pretty Violent stuff.
2,"Shame on Moustapha Akkad, this one is the worse of em all","I happen to be a person who likes all kinds of movies, and who somehow feels intrigued by Michael Myers since the original Halloween. The story was a good one in the first two parts, the third was a total shame, 4 and 5, in my opinion really topped the first two... Danielle Harris was great. Now for the 6th part, they didn't reach the price of Danielle Harris and she doesn't even appear, plus the story is a total fraud... it tries to make it look more ""commercially understandable"" with this stuff about the ""curse"", I mean... Get real... fortunately H20 is a lot better.I have to admit one thing: The soundtrack rocks, one of the best for halloween, and quite different. Plus the photography is somewhat interesting."
4,Not As Bad As Everyone Makes It Out To Be,"There are a lot of things about this movie that cloud the storylines, but some things that other reviewers slam are explained. Michael impregnated Jamie to create a final sacrifice. I think he planned to kill Jamie and then the baby. He tracks down the Strodes, who happen to be living in his former home, thinking that they have the baby since he can't find him after he kills Jamie (by the way, I wonder what Michael would have named the baby), since they would be related to Jamie through Laurie. That's what the call that Mrs. Strode gets saying ""we want the child"" is about. I'm not sure how the cult kept Michael for so long, but I think that's why he does away with them, possibly avenging himself for their using him. There are holes in the story, such as why the fetuses are shown, but Michael is at his menacing best here and the gore factor is off the charts. All in all a good horror flick that shouldn't be controversial, just enjoyed."
1,Cash Grab For Echo Bridge,"Attention Amazon.com customers....1. Avoid this release like the plague. This Blu-ray Disc only has the movie and nothing else. LITERALLY! No subtitles, no trailer, no anything.2. The picture is subpar for a high-definition transfer. Not to mention, it's not in the original aspect ratio. H20 was filmed in 1.85.1 This version's ratio was changed to 1.78.1.3. The audio is pathetic. You don't even get surround sound. You get a pitiful DTS 2.0 Stereo track. The DVD at least offered us a 5.1 mix. I thought Blu-ray Disc was supposed to be an upgrade from DVD?Save your money and avoid this title. Echo Bridge has a reputation for butchering films and they did themselves justice with this one. Until we as consumers stand up and quit buying this garbage of a release, they will never give us the quality that we deserve. The links below will give you a little more information concerning this release.[...]"
4,ONE OF THE BEST HALLOWEEN MOVIES!,This is one of my favorite Halloween movies probably since it explains a lot about the series. Defenatly get this one!RATED R: FOR STRONG TERROR VIOLENCE AND FOR SOME LANGUGE AND NUDITY AND FOR SOME BRIEF SEXUALITY
4,Scariest Halloween Yet!,"Halloween 6 was probably the scariest Halloween yet. It gets right off to Michael's killing spree, killing a nurse in probably the first 10 minutes of the film. The music (especially the return of the ""chase"" music), scenery, setting, and sound effects create a suspensful edge-of-your seat atmosphere. A good attempt to recreate the classic mask from 1 & 2 was made, doing away with the featureless mask from 4 & 5. A few drawbacks though; Jamie Lloyd returns, but her age doesn't match up with the time frame of the series, also the hospital scenes are very confusing, trying to figure out what is going on with all the fetuses and the baby gets viewers totally lost. All in all though, it is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, with the classic Michael we all remember!"
4,Cool Halloween movie.,This was a very thrilling but yet slow movie.The way the story was placed was a cool idea. Michael looking his best is slashing up victims who are in his home. Buy this one and you will be scared. (This house is sacred to him. This is his rage.)
2,What was The Director Thinking?,"Halloween 6 is second worst sequel of the series so far behind the third one. It was not worth waiting 6 years after the previous halloween. It did not seem like the director thought about what he was doing. First of all Jamie is suppose to be 15, when it appears that she is in her twenties. Second there was no point in putting all new characters such as Kara Strode and John Strode. There was also no point of bringing Tommy Doyle back. All this movie explains is the cult thorn. Which is why Michael go's after his family members. It is not hard to figure out that Dr. Wynn is Michaels Father. The only reason this junk gets two stars is because Dr. Loomis is in it and the director some how manages it to be scary."
5,Mrs. Hub loves Halloween,I am a huge fan of the Halloween Movies and was unable to find this movie anywhere else for the low low price. Thanks Amazon!
3,Pointless Halloween Movie,"Michael Myers returns in this extremely poorly-directed film where he easily tracks down Jamie Lloyd and then proceeds on to the other members of his family living in the old Myers house. Lucky for them, though, Tommy Doyle, the kid from the first movie who Laurie Strode babysat, finds Jamie Lloyd's baby and saves the day. At the end, he physically beats Michael to the ground, but the scene at there still made me laugh because of the fact that it has copied that pattern of Michael leaving the crime scene with no mask before, and it was worse with the person laughing at the end.Unfortunately, this is Donald Pleasance's last film, due to the sad fact that our Halloween hero died shortly before it was released. I don't think that Tommy Doyle will come back as a replacement hero, so other than Halloween H2O, the series goes downhill from here.Oh well, I suppose you can't miss it since it has all the classic Michael effects in it. Enjoy!"
2,What CRAP!,"This movie was horrible, but had a few good scenes. Still, even the third Halloween movie was better then this one. Don't buy it or waste your time watching it...you'll most likely be dissapointed."
3,Halloween-The Curse of bad direction,This film was actually some good.They just should of waited afew years to make it.The cast was horrible.They should of brought back the guy who played Tommy Dolye in the original.This movie is dependant on cheap scares and wasn't long enough.The producer's cut is better.the theactrical version doesn't even tell what happend to michael and Dr.loomis.And they changed John Carpenters Theme song.The only thing interesting about in is the storyline.Which wasn't even explained that good.Just don't by it.
1,A good Michael Myers movie,"I liked this one, other peaple doesnt think so. This one in my opinion was one the gretest ones.Peaple said this was the worst onw but i disagree Halloween 3 was, Halloween 3 didnt even had Michael.Dont even rent Halloween 3 its crap.Halloween 6 is worth watching.Tommy finally gets his hands on Michael, kinda like a 17 year revenge, last time we saw was on Halloween 1 and he was a kid. This was a good Halloween movie, Michael is scarier, the theme is scary. But one thing i hated bout this movie is that Jamie gets killed. But i enjoyed this movie"
1,Not a helpful book for educated or advanced business people,"I bought this book along with others to aide in writing a business proposal. This book was one of the least helpful. It contained review information for basic English and grammar that I was not at all interested-in. 2/3 of the book is fluff, with little or nothing to do with ""business.&quot"
3,Violence,"I am a reader that likes a good story without sex and violence. I love ""Borrowed Light, Enduring Light, and Marianne's Christmas Wish"". I can't believe that is the same author who wrote Daughter of Fortune. It was the most violent book I've ever read. I'm sure the times were that violent but it surprises me a woman author would write in such graphic detail."
2,Danger Ahead,"I loved all but 1 of the nearly 20 Carla Kelly novels and stories I read before DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE. As readers who loved this book warn, she places her characters in perilous times, well she often does that. At the end of the opening journey our heroine discovers she is homeless and friendless. She soon finds herself living in a complex social structure that defines for life the circumstances and struggles of the people around her. In this story her characters have none of the inventive opportunities or escapes we find in other Kelly stories. Not even Carla Kelly could interest me in this set-up, so I put DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE up for sale online and felt like a fraud. I say YES, to most Carla Kelly, but NO the newer Mormon stories and a strong NO to DAUGHTER OF FORTUNE."
3,"Comfortable, but not well made.","I got the comfort that I expected for paying $50 for the ct braces, but am not happy with the quality of the workmanship. I didn't find any factory sealed packaging here as some previous reviews suggested, my braces came together in a zip lock bag (bulk packaging). The braces fit well, size based on measurement is accurate, and are supportive and comfortable. However, the edges of the braces are cheaply stitched and the velcro straps aren't much better. The straps are already starting to shred strands and I'm not convinced that they will be very durable. Side by side, one of the braces is slightly irregular and has more material covering my thumb on the top of my right hand. I guess I just expected them to be of a higher quality than the $12 ct braces that you can buy at Walmart."
5,Excellent product. Highly recommend it,I have had carpal tunnel for some time now. I have done everything I could to help alleve the problem. Ergonomic keyboard at my desk at work. AT night I take advil. I have even undergone acupuncture. But none of these things could minimize the amount of numbness and tingling I would experience during the night while sleeping. I bought these upon recommendation of a friend who also suffers from carpal tunnel. When I wear them at night I no longer experience the tingling or numbness. Have forgotten to put them on before settling in for the night and the tingling and numbness returned.
2,Didn't live up to the description displayed,"The info on these braces says they are for carpal tunnel, however, they do not support the thumbs and therefore CAUSE pain."
4,Helped with wrist pain/carpal tunnel,"The built quality is great and helped ease wrist pain. Only two complaints, 1. The brace gets a little hot and leave my wrist sweaty after prolonged use. 2. The opening where my four fingers fit, is a little tight and should be covered with a softer elastic material."
3,"Good fit, poor seams","I like the look and feel. It seems to help slowly but surely with my 20 hour work days and healing. I am a software engineer so I am constantly typing and on a computer. However it seems the seam quality is not that great and of poor quality. A few months after purchasing and very few uses at night (I only put on some nights before bed) the seam has broken so the metal plate does not have the normal resistance that it should. Going to purchase a second set and give it another go, hoping this was just a fluke. Will update review with new results."
4,It really helps,I have been getting a better night sleep since wearing the braces. No more tingling or pain when wearing them.
2,bought xl and still too small,"my fiances hands go numb when he sleeps. so a dr recommended wearing these at night, so far it hasnt helped, weve also been useing pentrex cream sold on amazon too... no luck yet =( but hes 5;11' regular sized hands. maybe a little girthier then most. and i am shocked to see a mens xl doesnt fit him! not worth the shipping to send back to exchange. but just wanted you all to know to order a size bigger than you think"
4,"""Benny""s Aunt""","A fun movie, which I'm glad is at long last available. The item arrived quickly and in good shape, and the price was certainly right. I hope to use the vendor again soon."
3,Jack Benny in drag,"The movie is funny and worth watching. It does notmove at a fast pace like other Jack Benny movies, ie,George Washington slept here."
2,Cross dressing tragedy!,"Cross dressing men as women to create comedy is an honorable custom that goes back to the Greeks. It's success depends a lot on the writing, and a great deal on the acting. ""Charlie's Aunt"" is an English play dating back to the beginning of the last century, well served by an earlier film version starring Charlie Ruggles, and a memorable stage musical starring the great Ray Bolger. I hoped for years that the Jack Benny version would be revived at some point, and was delighted when it became available, only to have my dreams shattered by what I should have expected, sly comedy turned into broadly coarse burlesque. Benny, with the right director, such as Lubitsch, was capable of great comedy, but in this, the effort of pushing the point that Benny was really a butch male and couldn't have a gay bone in his body turned the comedy to coarsness which undermines an otherwise splendid cast, including Kay Francis looking her best and most charming...."
1,rated 1 star as -5 isn't an option,"""Lack of clear definitions?"" Not a single definition in this book is correct! The author so badly mangles the terminology of basic undergraduate algebra, that it's hard to believe he understands anything of this advanced subject. This book is an abomination that was printed over the strong objections of an expert reviewer by a company more interested in publishing quantity than quality. I mourn the trees that have been sacrificed.The reviewer who claims to have worked in ECC for 10 years, but is still looking for a good intro, wasn't paid enough to write a favorable review of this book! My recommendation: pick up a copy of Seroussi/Blake/Smart today and wait for a sale, if you must, on Koblitz, Silverman and Menezes. All of these are excellent works by knowledgeable, well-respected mathematicians."
3,"Good selection of topics, but...","an inconsistent level of explanation. The author does not seem to have a definite idea of what is to be assumed, so his explanations are a bit patchy. In some places, he goes into a lot of detail on the calculational techniques; but in others, his presentation is fuzzy even on the concepts.I suspect that this book has most to offer on the practical implementation issues, which are highlighted in the title; but it is not sufficient as a stand-alone presentation even on the implementation, not to speak of the conceptual structure & approach, of Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Maybe the author enjoys mathematics, but he's clearly not a mathematician.This book would best serve as a guide to practical implementation for someone who has already developed a good idea of how ECC is supposed to work."
1,not the best by this author,"It's Christmas time, and a man comes to see Holmes at 221 B with a strange story. It seems that a man he has never met before has invited him to his home in Sussex for a party to celebrate the holidays. He wants to know whether or not he should go -- and Holmes tells him to do whatever he'd like to do. The man then invites Holmes and Watson (whose wife is away with relatives for the holidays) to join him, and off they go, meeting several other people who have never met their host before. It's not long until the purpose behind this rather odd gathering is revealed, and Holmes & Watson are off again trying to solve the crime.While I admit that the premise is quite good (and new to me), it's so obvious what's going on that Billy, the boy who helps Holmes in many of his adventures, could have solved it. Aargh! Not one of Val Andrews' best, by far. I think this one is actually skippable."
5,READ IT NOW,This book changed my life our forth grade teacher read it to the class after we'd been having troble with cliques. evrything the book talks about is true now we solve our clique problems with out using names or using examples from the book to put the bullys in the bullyed shoes.SignedClique Hater
4,Explaining the way kids can be and why!,"This was a wonderful boook told in a humorous way. If you have a child in the pre-teen years that is puzzled by ""cliques"" at school....this book tells it perfectly!"
4,easy read,"My daughter read this in a matter of little over an hour. She says it's good and has practical advice, but it wasn't the longest. Good for younger (maybe pre-teens)."
3,It's okay...,My fourth grade daughter got bored with it quite quickly. Lots of definitions....wasn't very fun for her to continue reading.
4,Good price,"I ordered this product on the advice of Al Sears, [...] I have purchased other brands in the past but at a higher price. The purpose is to decrease levels of homocystein and thereby increase life expectancy. I have not had tests done to determine my homocystein levels because it is much cheaper to be safe."
5,Couldn't do clinicals without it!,"I love this book. A lot of my fellow 2nd year nursing students bought it after they saw mine. My only complaint is that there is only pathology; no wellness or risk for diagnoses, like ineffective breastfeeding; it is only by diagnosis. It has come in very helpfully for care plans."
3,Love's Gentle Journey by Kay Oldham Cornelius,"1985 special Zondervan press edition published exclusively for Guideposts' Forever Classics series.Description from the back cover:Theirs was a perilous journey ... across a vast ocean to uncharted wilderness ... but the hard-won prize would be ... A NEW WORLD. A New World for Ann McKay - Poised on the brink of uncertain womanhood, loath to leave behind the familiar haunts of home, lured by the promise of tomorrow. A New World for Caleb Craighead - The staunch Scottish schoolmaster, newly ordained to the ministry, challenged by God's call to the American frontier and the young woman who would take her place beside him."
5,Simply One of the Best,"I ordered this album from Australia. It was much cheaper and took less than two weeks to arrive, and it is well worth it. I discovered Anthony on the Internet and was blown away by his voice.This album is chock-full of hits from beginning to end. There isn't one song I skip. Anthony is great at ballads like ""The Prayer,"" but he's just as good at pop songs, and ""Rain"" is a gem. If you like the CD, you will love the DVD of his concert, as well. I can't understand why this young man has never become a hit here in the U.S. Josh Groban fans would love him."
2,A waste of ten dollars,"I bought Anthony's album off iTunes when I heard somebody compare him to Josh Groban. This guy is no Josh Groban and anybody who says he is doesn't know music. Anthony's album is mainly outdated pop trash that was popular to 14 year old girls back in 1992. There's one good song here. ""Per Sempre"" is good. He manages to fake some emotion in this song. The rest are soulless attempts at singing. Yeah he has a good voice. But just a voice doesn't make one an artist. LeAnn Rimes had more soul and depth singing ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" when she was 15 than this guy does in his 20's.If you think this guy is a good singer, chances are you also think he's cute. And I bet his looks have a lot to do with why you like him so much."
3,There is a better Buzz ship out there,"This is a decent toy, but the doors constantly fall off and as such can be a frustrating experience for a little kid.(...)"
4,buzz light year spaceship,"Great toy. Good size, not too big or too small.No loud noises or batteries, which is especially nice considering the abundance of deafening toys available.Kids can use their own imagination and not worry about getting it wet. The only thing that was not so great are the doors on top. They do not close or open smoothly which can cause a small child to break them if he/she is not gentle."
5,Thumbs Up!,"From body-language.com: ""Another Bruno Gmunder wonder! If you've seen any of the Titan videos you know what these hunks look like. If you are a twinkie fan, this is NOT for you. If you like REAL MEN, Titan Men will be the book you want or to give as a gift. After looking thru Titan Men you are going to run out and buy steroids and vitamins!"""
4,Very clear and crisp,"This monitor is very clear and crisp. Also, Windows XP recognized it right away for what it is. The DVI hookup makes it even better. I love that I can play my iPod while playing a game and they don't interfere with each other."
3,Excellent monitor. Not great extras,"The color rendition of this monitor is really great. I'm using it spanned with an older Dell flatpanel, and the colors are so much better on the Viewsonic that it makes me reconsider how much I previously thought of Dell flat panels.However, everything else about the monitor is less than ideal: The bezel is large, and the reflective black distracting, and the monitor lacks color balance controls (The only two settings are brightness and contrast).The USB hub and speakers require a bulk wall-wart to function, which I find to be a definite annoyance.Despite all of this I'd probably buy the monitor again because of the great color reproduction, but it definitely leaves some things to be desired."
1,Go with the Dell Monitor,I tried to install the software for the monitor and got an error message that it cannot be installed automatically. I was given instructions to install it manually. The resolution is terrible. The manual says that the monitor setting have to be at 1440x900 to get the optimum resolution. Most of the computers in the market do not support this resolution. Viewsonic claims that you can plug your ipod and it will automatically sync with your computer. I plugged my Ipod and got an error message that my computer cannot recognize the device. I called Viewsonic customer service and they told me that I have to purchase a special video card that can support 1440x900 resolution. They also couldn't help me fix the sync problem with my ipod. I have 4 dell monitors that work perfectly and are user friendly. Go with the Dell monitors.
1,What a Pathetic Product!,"I ordered the ViewSonic 19'' Widescreen Monitor for Christmas and received it today, January 4th. I thought it would be a fantastic monitor to hook to my laptop but ended up spending the evening in agony. The buttons locked up and i was not able to restore it to normal. Also it proves unwieldy. It is very heavy, the black piano finish appears oily/greasy and the power adapter gets extremely hot. Save yourself the anguish. Go buy yourself the Bose Companion 3 or 5 Multimedia speaker system or the Logitech z5500 THX certified multimedia system. And then buy yourself the Gateway 24'' widescreen or the Samsung 931C which are both out of this world."
3,Great bra but runs small,"I really like this bra--it's comfortable, the lace adds some sexiness, and it doesn't show under clothing. But it runs small. I'm a pretty solid 32D in every other bra I wear, and my cups runneth over in this one."
1,Don't know!!!!!!,"Ordered three bras. Two from Amazon, and one from one of their vendors. I received my bras from Amazon a week and a half ago, and worn them both. I still have not received this bra. It has been more than three weeks now since I placed the order. Too bad cause its so pretty!"
3,Can't say that it was great,"I was impressed with book, but it wasn't great. I have read better. It was a little predictable."
5,Get this one!,"I had no problems with this whatsoever. The plastic is thick, and it has pieces to cover virtually every part of your iPod. I have ZERO bubbles left under, so if you're careful like I was that won't happen."
5,Another Winner,Dave Seaman again shows why many consider him the king of progressive Trance. Luke Chable's set is one of a kind with awesome breaks. Must Have!
1,had no effect,I have been taking 3 doses every day for the past two weeks and I did not feel any change in my anxiety level nor did I feel more relaxed like the label said. So I guess I would say that this product don't work for me. I've also tried the 250mg KAVA KAVA medication for social anxiety taking 2 pills per day and I also didn't notice any effect from that...
3,You will be cheated if you buy 2 products together,"Amazon recommends ""better together"" if you buy ""Spanish 3"" and ""Simple spanish subjunctive"" together. That is not fair because the two products are, track by track, identical. How can identical products be better together?"
2,no case,this kit did not come in a case like it says it does in the description. it is a great item you just do not recieve a case with it. i can not find how to contact amazon to get this taken care of
1,Not Real Riedel Vinum Glasses,"These are NOT authentic Ridel Vinum glasses. I ordered a pair and compared them to Ridel Vinum glasses purchased at a wine store and while they look similar they are most definitely not authentic. The stems are attached to the base vs. being one solid piece. They also do not have the correct Ridel stamp on the base. This may sound snobby, but if you're paying for Ridel, then you should get actual Ridel glasses. I will say that the seller was very nice about returning them and took care of me, but I feel it necessary to warn people that what they are selling is not what they have listed, these glasses are of sub-par quality."
4,New at this,"I was happy with the price for the product. I was a bit surprised with how thin the stems were. I understand the bowl needing to be a certain shape to enhance the wine, but thought the stem was too thin. Maybe it is supposed to be that way. Not sure. I'm new at this, but it seemed odd to me."
4,Fun,"Fun item with cute boats and water wheel. The legs seem a but weak when you put water in it, especially on the grass. Also the little boats are cheap and un snap frequently."
5,"Awesome toy, awesome price","My 2 year-old got this for his birthday 3 months ago and he still asks to go outside to play with it almost everyday. He's never cared for the little sailboats that come with, but he loves the cup and water wheel. We also put bath toys (the squishy ones that squirt water) and Hot Wheels in there for him to play with. Wish it came with an umbrella like the sand & water tables, but we just wait til after dinner when the sun's behind the house. Super easy assembly- NO tools required at all! Can't beat the price either. Overall, great toy- so glad I got it."
4,Fun Water Table,I got this water table for my 20 month old daughter to use throughout the summer. She loves it and will grow in to the table more as she gets older. She can not quite reach to dump water in the top bucket but likes to try anyway. My only complaint is the boats don't stay up well and she is always pulling the sail out. She doesn't seem to care about them at all so I have been putting rubber ducks and other items in the table instead. My two and half year old neice also loves to play with it. She is just the right size.
3,kids easily bored with it,"we used to have the sand box with the lid and i recommend those, before buying something that you can't cover very easily........ the boats are junky and we eventually tossed them........... i know this sells for a lot of $ and is still popular, but being a mom of 3, take my word for it, that just spend the extra $ on one with a cover (but also avoid the little tikes one with 8 legs that folds up over itself.....also junk)i am a step2 naturally playful fan.......the lid on that sandbox is indestructable!"
4,Great toy!...expect your child to be wet!,"We purchased this toy for our son for his 2nd birthday. He loved the table and used it every chance he got. What we didn't occur to us was him being completely soaked! Expect it. He has since lost some interest in it as you cannot do too much with it. I think we may add some suds next time! Very durable, it has been outside since we got it. I read other reviews stating that the plug doesn't keep the water in the table but we have not had a problem with this. Great water toy for the $$"
5,WaterWheel and the Sand Kingdom,"This is a great product. It works as advertised. The quality of the one we received was very good. It holds our son's attention for a long time.By the way, for sand, we got the Sand Kingdom and keep them at different parts of our yard so he doesn't mix the sand and water. The Sand Kingdom comes with a yellow plastic cover I thought would never work, but it does. The sand is always dry and no critters have made their way in yet. The cover only overlaps the sides by an inch or so, but somehow it stays on. Our son seems to gravitate towards the sand kingdom more - beware they both make a mess but we keep them outside. All part of having kids."
4,Summer Fun,"My son is 13 months old and has a lot of fun splashing around in this toy. He is a little young to use some of its functionality; he can't reach the top of the water tower, but likes to watch me pour water and see the wheel spin. It's a good toy to keep them occupied outside during the summer months."
4,Kids like their water table.,"Its a nice table although the ""toys"" that comes with the table like the boats, are very cheaply made and won't last long."
5,Fun on a sunny day,"Smallish, but very easy to put together, and fun on a hot day when you don't have a pool. Sturdy, easy to keep clean, and two small children can play with it at the same time. May even bring it in to the kitchen on a boring winter day. Great for grandma's house if you have an extra set of clothes to change into afterwards."
4,Great gift for someone else's child,I bought this as a gift for my godson and his twin sister. Their parents aren't too enthused about it but they love it! I'd invest in a few smocks to keep their clothes dry (for most part)!
2,"Great idea, poor quality","Great idea...was so excited for my one year old grandson to play with...however he was a little small yet so 4 yr old sister played with it. She enjoyed it while it lasted...didn't last long, bottom cracked and wouldn't hold water. Still a great idea. Just need to make it with a more durable plastic."
4,Great for the price,"Given the price, this is a great water table. It's simple--kids don't need much. It's nice that it is small, so it is easy to dump out and clean out. My only complaints are that I wish Step 2 had considered putting it on 4 legs and using sturdier legs (a cover would be nice, too). I like using this table with ""Moon Sand"", shaving cream and other messy stuff, but without the weight of the water the table is very prone to tipping. I also have the Step 2 ""sand and water"" table, and we only use sand in that one because it's too hard to clean the water side out (it gets slimy and really needs to be wiped and hosed out). Also the sand and water table has a drain plug, which my 2 year old likes to remove :) so it's a good thing that this table does NOT have a drain plug."
4,Great value!,This water table is great for the price! We paid $25 for it and my daughter loves it. The only thing I can say that I do not care for is that it has no drain. I understand that there isn't one so the kids don't pull it out; I'm sure there is a way of making a child proof plug. The toys that come with it are decent we added a few of our own as well. The height of the table is perfect for my one year old.
4,Great for backyard or patio fun!,My 2yr old loves this thing and so do we. Its great for the backyard or even a small covered patio. Its especially nice when its warm out because she gets to play as well as cool off - plus I dont have to worry about her drowning if I turn my back! Definitely a Good Buy for outdoor fun!
4,Water Play Table,"We liked this toy and got much use from it over the summer in the backyard for my 2-year old son. The accessories that came with it were good. The kids also used Fisher-Price Little People and made a ""water park"" for them in the table. Plenty of room for imaginitive play with this toy."
5,Wonderful water toy! A must have!,"My 17 month old little girl absolutelyloves this toy. We play outside in texas heat for ours with it, I have added more cups and some fun fish to play with. She would stay out there all day. Its easy to empty and so easy to clean. I am so glad we have it. It sure keeps us cool!The water wheel is so easy to use and she loves watching it spin. Lots of fun."
2,Not very exciting and it does not have a lid!,"I saw this water table at the store and I must say that it was not very exciting. The water funnel is the best part of the table and even that is just okay. The table does not have a lid, which is a serious negative to a water table. I don't want my kids playing with this inside because they will make a mess, but if they play with it outside, then I have no way to cover it. It will definitely get all gross being outside in the bad weather. Leaves, bugs, dirt and who knows what else will get into this table. Not recommended."
2,A Very Disappointing Purchase,After reading tons of rave reviews on this toy I was very excited to go purchase one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for the summer. She already has a Step 2 ladybug sandbox that she absolutely loves so I figured this would be a good addition...WRONG! My daughter shows very little interest in it at all and the only thing she does use it for is to climb inside of it and try to use it as a swimming pool which of course isn't very safe. I am dissapointed that she doesn't like it and now we are pretty much stuck with an almost brand new toy that will probably get very little use.
4,Happy Boy,"I gave this to my best friend's son on his 2nd birthday and he absolutely LOVES it. Based on several of the reviews, I was worried, but I have checked in with them about it several times & they are still very happy with it, They have not had any of the issues mentioned in the more negative reviews."
4,Well Worth The Money.,"I ordered the Step 2 WaterWheel Activity Play Table for my 16 month old. He has really enjoyed it. The boats that come with it are kind of flimsy and come apart to easy, so I got him some better ones to use. The table is very durable. My son has climbed in it, all 27 lbs of him and it did not tip over. It is heavy enough with the water in it so he can't move it which is nice. This winter I will probably put some sand in it so he will be able to use it year round."
4,Lots of fun!,"My daughter loves this water table! She has a lot of fun playing in the water with all of her toys. My only complaint would be the shipping... because of the size of the table the box got very beat up, and there are some marks on the table. Since it is an outside toy anyway, it didn't really bother me, but it is something to consider."
2,Flimsy Water Tower,"The real problem with this product is that the water tower is not attached. My toddler son would become frustrated when he poured water into it only to see it fall off. I eventually ""made the water tower go away"". Then it was just a boring / overpriced water table."
4,Step 2 WaterWheel Activity Play Table,"I sent this to my great-nephew for his first birthday. I was told he loved it and his four and six year old sisters had fun with it, too. I can only rate this toy from heresay as I didn't get to see it in person, although I saw a picture of my nephew having a good time with it."
4,It's pretty nice--boats fall apart & tower tips over,"It's also hard to keep clean. Gets dirty on patio & mildewy if water is left in, so I guess I like it. The polar bear one looked cuter to me but the reviews said a tower tipped over and was annoying--this tower tips over, too."
4,Activity Table,"I bought this for my 2 year-old grandson and he loves it. The only problem is that all of the parts are removable and could easily be misplaced, but not a huge issue. Another plus is that more than one child can play with it at the same time."
5,great water table,My 17 month old is having tons of fun with this table! He plays with kitchen utensils in it or just splashes water everywhere. The sailboats it came with are not real durable for a toddler but the water wheel is very strong and he hasn't been able to take it apart yet. The price was unbeatable. I am very glad we chose this table.
4,Water table...,"Not bad - It was sturdier than I expected, but I am disappointed that there is no way to let out the water without having to lean the table over. It's keeping my 22mth old busy which is what I needed it for!"
4,good deal for the price,"I bought this for my daycare kids & my 6yr daughter. They love it and Ihave no regrets buying it; however I do wish that it had a plug todrain the water. Also, I was disappointed that the water tower doesn'tsnap into place in any way. It just sits there loosely and is easilyknocked over by the kids causing frustration. But over all it's a lot of funand the kids love it which is what matters in the end!"
5,Great Fun!,My 18 month old daughter loves this table. It is very sturdy and was put together in just a few minutes. My daughter has had hours of fun with this and I know she will still be playing with it next summer too! It has been a great purchase and a toy that she goes to play with every time she is outside.
3,Nice but not blown away.,"I can't really find anything wrong with this water table, I'm just not overly impressed. It is good quality. It doesn't keep my toddler entertained like I read other parents say in their reviews. He might play with the toys for a minute, then throw them on the ground and climb on the table and sit in the water. Not very safe and stressful to watch! We have a pool for him but he'd rather sit in the table. He also likes to use the cup to scoop water and water the plants. oh well."
3,Water Table,"This toy only keeps my 2 year old granddaughter's attention for a short time. She prefers the sandbox but we keep them on opposite sides of the yard. I know, making mud pies would be the most fun. It's definitely nice to have in the yard on a hot day as we don't have a pool here. My only real complaint is that when it arrived the box was badly crushed and torn. There are a lot of stress marks all over it. If this had been a gift we would have sent it back."
5,Great Toy!,I love this water table but my 1yr old and 1/2 son loves it even more. I recomend this table to all. Its easy to install and fun starts immediatly!
3,WaterWheel Play Table,"Our grandson hasn't been able to play with this much as yet. They were waiting for him to be able to use it in the yard, which is not prepared as yet for taking this outside."
3,"Cute, but my kids weren't impressed","I am certainly in the minority but this has been sitting in our backyard, rarely used. I can see how it would be fun but my 3 and 1 year old only had interest in it for about a week. I agree that the tower should hook into place. I also have a 5 year old and he has little or no interest. I'm thinking about putting sand in it to give that a try."
1,Storage anyone?,"This is a nice little table, but it doesn't come apart for storage, which means that... unless you have a very large basement or storage area in which to keep it in off-season, or don't mind leaving it outside in the rain and snow, or want to use it as a coffee table in the living room, you'll be giving it to the neighbor's kids and letting them worry about it."
4,Yippeeeeeeeeeeeeee,My daughter is 21 months and LOVES this toy!! It has taught her how to pour without getting it on her!! (however she does manage to get soaking wet whenever she uses it!!) It was a great investment
4,Awesome summer fun!,"We got this for our twins' birthday and had a small party with 8 or so kids over. This was the starof the party and was plenty large for all the kids 1.5-3 yr olds to play around without fighting. Thelittle boats that come with it are rather pathetic and were rapidly discarded. The fact that the water wheelis not attached was not a problem, it was sturdy enough to stay up most of the time and the kids lovedthat they could pick it up and pour the water out (usually on someone else). Overall a great buy to keepthe kids entertained and cool on hot summer days."
4,fun water table,My one year old son got this for his 1st birthday. It was a rainy day so we set it up in our kitchen. He played there for over an hour (his attention span is not normally that long) along with his two big sisters (ages 6 and 8). I think they had just as much fun as he did. I think it will last a long time and will be a great thing for them to play with when the weather warms up. My only thing is that I wish it had a cover to keep bugs out when not in use. That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.
4,Water fun,"I switched from a sand and water table to this and I am so happy I did. The toys are a little flimsy but I do not think they are flimsy enough to break. Legs come off for storage. I've seen all my children play with it,not just the baby."
4,Wet fun for little ones,"My son loves water and this table gives him the ability to experience getting wet without having to be in the bath. The accessories allow him to interact with moving parts and do more with water than he can in the tub. I caution that some parts are somewhat small presenting the danger of choking when disassembled, as most kids will do. Also taller children, like my boy will climb into the table risking tipping the table over since it only has three legs, and drowning, albeit only in inches of water. These past two dangers are the reason I rated this toy as a 4 star instead of 5. Overall, if you stay with your young children and keep a vigil watch as they play all should be well. Young children should never be left unattended near open water in any case as the warnings on this product plainly state."
5,Holding up well!!,"I purchased this as an outside toy for our daughter. It's been out in the sun, rain, wind and no problems yet. It cleans up well with just dish soap and water."
5,summer fun,"kids play on this for hours and hours.this thing will take about good couple hours for kids go have fun with water.Got this based on other ratings, and as expected worked for me."
4,Granddaughter loves it,I bought this for my 18 month old granddaughter since she loves splashing in the bath. I did need to buy her a plastic smock to wear as she tended to spill the water all over herself. I found that out the first time she tried it :)..She loves going outside and playing with it. Everytime she comes over we go outside if it is a nice day so she can play in it. I wouldn't recommend this for indoors for toddlers but during the summer months this is great. It keeps her entertained for a long time.
5,WaterWheel,"I sent this to my granddaughter for her 1st birthday. It was such a hit my daughter sent pictures of all the children playing with it at her party. My 18 month old granddaughter had so much fun with it her Mother ordered one too, and so did my boss for her niece. No problems with leaking or anything. My 3 year old grandson plays with it too. I couldn't be happier with this choice."
5,Awesome fun,This is great fun for the summer time. I purchased one for my daughter and one for her cousin. They love it and it provides loads of entertainment and holds up pretty well to the elements.
4,Great toy for the price,"We bought this toy for my 2 year old and he really enjoys it. I like that it was a water only toy, we have a sand box and that mix just has nightmare written all over it. Its a sturdy table and was simple to put together. I dont mind that it doesnt have a cover, there are 2 water drains so at the end of the day I just empty the water and if the next time there are leaves I just brush them away and refill it. I do advise leaving the plugs open incase it should rain."
5,So Glad I Bought It!,"I gave this to my daughter for her second birthday not realizing that my 5 y.o. would love it just as much! They play together for hours on the back deck.It is a wonderful design - it is just the right height for both of them to play comfotably. There are two levels of play connected by a hill which the girls love rolling balls, etc down. It includes quite a bit, too. Two sail boats, a scoop, and a water wheel with a deatchable top sieve.It is a perfect size for a deck or patio - not too big or imposing. It won't make your deck look like a toy store.All in all, I am really please with this product. You should feel good buying it."
5,great for nice days in the backyard,Our 16-month-old can spend forever standing at this table pouring water from bucket to bucket. It's a great backyard investment.
3,Water Play Table,"DD received this for her 1st birthday in July. So far, she's not really grasped the waterwheel function, so we've really just used it for some fun diaper-only splashing on hot days.I was disappointed in the so-called ""boats,"" the sail has to be in just the right place or they fall over and float on their sides. Not so much fun when that happens, and with a 1 year old, the sails rarely stay in the right place. Bringing out a few bath toys was more fun for her than the boats (and for me since the boats don't really do much more than bob around on the waves, and you have to really add a lot of water to the top 'pond' to get a boat to go over the waterway).Since she is on the young end of the age range, I expect that it will get more use over the next few summers and will last through those uses without any breakage."
2,poor quality,Purchased this last summer-it had been on the deck all along and found it to be cracked. I will be throwing it out and buy a sturdier one
4,"Lots of fun, a little flimsy","My twin 1 year old boys received this for Christmas. They enjoy playing with it as well as my 4 year old boy. The water wheel is a great feature and I have no problems with it working. I didn't realize that it is just a piece that sits on the table. It is not permanently attached or doesn't even have the option to attach/detach, so the twins are constantly pulling it over. But, that is something they will grow into. Also, it is fairly lightweight, so as they are holding onto it, it moves across the floor. As soon as it's warm outside, we'll take it in the grass where this probably won't be an issue. I like how you fill the top area with water and it starts flowing down to the lower area. It's a good deal for the money and we look forward to enjoying it more."
4,"My sixteen month old loves this toy, but it leaks!","I bought this water table to occupy my very active sixteen month old son. I decided against a sand table because he is still at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth. We are having a similar problem as a previous reviewer - one of the plugs leaks, very rapidly, despite my many attempts at emptying the table, resetting the plugs, and refilling. I plan to call Step 2 and hopefully they will resolve this issue."
1,the table does not hold water,The concept of this table was great. It is one piece and nicely laid out but it does not hold the water. The plugs in the bottom leak. We called Step2 and they did not have a fix for the problem so we returned this table. Step2 needs to remove the drain holes at the bottom of the table and this table would be perfect.Wait for the updated version.
5,The Perfect Summer Toy,"Both my 2 year old and almost 4 year old LOVE this toy! It's so much fun - totally inexpensive - and worth every penny. From kids who are just learning to stand to kids who have been walking and running for years, this is a great toy. So glad we bought it!"
4,Waterwheel Play Table,"I got one of these at a yard sale for my grandchild and she loved it as well as the little children who came over to play with her. It was fabulous, but after a winter outside, the plastic did crack, and I had to throw it out. But then again, I don't know how many winters it spent outside before me.I bought this one on Amazon for my sister's little toddlers, and they too love it. It is nice because you don't have to put a ton of water in it, they can splash about in it, keeping cool, and floating their boats, and watching how the water wheel works.If my grandchildren come back east again, I would consider buying another one for them! (but find somewhere to store it in winter!)"
4,Great toy for toddlers!,"We got this as a gift for our toddler-she loves it! It's not the most sturdy thing ever, but good for the price."
4,"Fun, fun, fun!",My husband and I bought this for our grandson's first birthday. I wasn't sure if it might be too big for him but it's perfect. He absolutely loves it. We were so happy with our purchase.
5,A Hit from the Start!,"The WaterWheel Play Table was a hit in our backyard from the start! It's very entertaining for children especially from ages 2 to 5. It's lightweight enough for a quick and easy set up, and yet it's sturdy enough to hold the water and additional water toys. Note: The table would be even better if it came with at least one additional cup (we added our own)."
4,Lots of creative fun!,"Bought this for my 4 year old and 2 year old grandaughters. They played with it almost the entire day when they received it. Besides the boats that come with the toy, the girls love using their set of toy dishes to pretend they are pouring and serving tea, and also giving their baby dolls baths. Keeps them really cool on hot days. The toy is very sturdy and was very simple to put together--just snap on the legs. I recommend this to anyone looking for a fun summer outdoor toy"
4,Waterwheel table review,My kids (1.5 yrs and 3.5 yrs) love this toy. Mostly they love to dump the water out with the cups :) I put in extra cups when friends come over. The other part they like is the water wheel.
1,Rubbish,"These are rubbish. I got them to trim my facial hair, they cause the clippers to pull your hair though. They are unuseable....if thats a word.."
3,AA_Ok!,Working For My Machine Not Much To Say Am Not A barber Trying To Save Some Greens And Lost Time.
1,awful!,"So sorry, but I did not like this CD at all! I nievely thought it was a soundtrack to the Ramona and Beezus movie. It was really low quality and garage-band-like."
2,a word to the wise,"This translation of Aristotle's Metaphysics is published by NuVision Publications, which says that they are ""specializing in rare, out-of-print books still in demand."" The translator is W. D. Ross, and the translation was first published by Oxford University Press in the early nineteen thirties. It was later republished by Random House under the editorship of Richard McKeon. It seems that the translation is now in the public domain since the title page has no data on copyright. NuVision is to be commended for making available classics that are out of print. But they have hardly done justice to W. D. Ross. I have only made my way through Book III (out of XIV)of the Metaphysics, but I am distressed by too frequent errors of punctuation, omission of words, change of word order, and a total mangling of the last paragraph of Book III that makes it altogther unintelligible. Aristotle deserves better, and so does the reputation of W. D. Ross."
4,The classic work,"This extraordinary text totally paved the way for the rest of Western metaphysics. It is a lucid text, though still difficult because of the complexity of the ideas. In it, Aristotle posits his famous causes of being, material, formal, efficient, final. And he conceptualizes the criteria for essence. There is almost no way to master the contents of this body of work, it has challenged the greatest thinkers ever since its rediscovery and will continue to astound and mystify for as long as it continues to exist.This translation is fair, though the Hugh Tredennick is a bit clearer."
4,Terrific Tadich Grill,"If you have ever been to this old restaurant near the Financial District of San Francisco, you will like and appreciate this book. The SAS (steak & seafood) here is simply seasoned but very good to eat. The book's old pictures are fascinating. Try the recipes at home and impress your dinner guests. If you have some cooking skills, you will have few problems following the recipes. As Tony Bennett sang, "" I left my heart in San Francisco.. or was it the Tadich Grill?"" By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet"
3,Marie's Review,I only got this movie because I'm a Tim Matheson fan. They showed alot more of Joanna Kerns. The movie is disturbing. Especially if a similar thing happened to you. Apparently it's a true story. Joanna Kerns was good.
2,packaging,Product was very poorly packaged and arrived with the top broken off and the product spilled throughout the box.Otherwise the price was fair and I managed to pour the remaining product into another container. I would not purchase a fragile product from this company.
1,Product does not work,all of my nails chipped 2 days later. I expected my manicure to last a week based on the reviews.
3,It's OK,"This product was pretty glossy. The nail polish chipped faster than with other topcoats (I was using all Zoya products, but I can't be 100% sure which product was at fault)."
1,Peels,I thought this would last longer based on reviews but it peels just as fast as a Cover Girl product or something similar. Not impressed.
3,Learning from the Wit and Wisdom of Others,"Excellent resource for speeches! I use it as a ""topical guide"" to find the appropriate quote and then build my speech from that. It has worked very well."
1,Horrible,"I was expecting an interesting book about the history of the F word. What I got was a small book that looked like it had been made on a copy machine, and was filled with extremely boring references. I usually enjoy these types of books, but this one was a loser."
1,WHY do we NEED THIS word??,"Are we so unintelligent that we must use words like this in our language? Truly intelligent people don't need to use words like this to convey a thought or opinion. In a world where children speak disrespectfully to parents and every sentence spoken by many people contains an obscenity is it really necessary to focus on what many consider the most useless word in the English Lanuage? Reader's Digest carried an article in their Dec 1998 issue about this word's uselessness. We no longer need consent of a king to fornicate, must we glamorize this word to keep it alive? Does Random House think this is the type of book we as Americans NEED to read? They have certainly scraped the bottom of the barrel publishing this book. I've got a suggestion.. instead of reading this book, why don't we drop it from our language? There are certainly other words that can be substituted for ""The F Word"", and other books too."
3,Not exactly what i was looking for,The book was not exactly whta i was looking for as i needed a book on how to prepare a sports portfolio. The book gudes you on how to prepare an arts portfolio.
5,Excellent Introduction,"Barry Cunliffe is one of the finest scholars and researchers in this field. This is an excellent introduction to a field that is often littered with junk created by those trying to cash in on ""Celtomania.""I highly recommend any work by this author, who has long been a source of inspiration to me."
3,"Great for Florida, but--","This book was written by a Floridian, and there are several recipes in this book that would only do for Floridians. My power is more likely to go out during a blizzard or ice storm than a hurricane, which means that avocados and fresh herbs are out of the question. (""Quick, run to the store for avocados and cilantro! There's a blizzard coming!"")"
4,A Good Guide,"OK. No book attempting to establish any kind of a canon, let alone a gay canon is going to satisfy anyone. I picked this book up a couple of years ago, and used it as the basis for an online book group that read through Drake's recommended book group selections. Since then, the book group has dissolved, but I've kept the book on hand as a handy guide when I'm looking for something to read and don't have any immediate ideas. Drake's list is by no means exhaustive or all-inclusive, but it's a good place for the curious, or anyone who just wants to broaden their literary horizons, to start."
3,A Necessity that Longs for Expansion,"Literary study demands a Gay Anthology, and a companion to such a compilation, but this particular attempt is sparse and leaves much to be desired. Drake offers brief commentary on a variety of works, some that overtly belong in the ""gay canon,"" some that don't, but in too many places, the commentary is too brief. For example, the entry on Arthur Rimbaud is merely 3 paragraphs long. There is no mention of Sappho in the book. Overall, this book is a great idea, but it has been a poorly executed one in this case."
4,Diego Rivera's Tall Tales,"Originally published in 1963, Bertram Wolf's bio of the Mexican artist remains an important and entertaining part of the Rivera literature to this day. A major problem, however: the present edition is a second printing of the 1990 paperback edition, and the quality of the photographic reproductions in the book is no better than a poorly printed newspaper. The illustrations in the 1963 hardcover biography were not great, but at least they were clear and legible. The beautiful typeface has been preserved as have the illustrations (by Rivera) that accompany each chapter heading and, most importantly, Wolf's rich narrative of the life and stories of Diego Rivera."
5,Over-the-top talent,"If you like your musicians to have over-the-top technical virtuosity, artistry, and ebullience in an extraordinarily personable package, you'll love saxophonist Patrick Lamb. With every CD he gets better. (Also see my review of his CD ""For the Love"".) This Portland-based musician has extensively toured with multiple Grammy winner and vocalist Diane Schuur, as well as with pop/jazz vocalist Bobby Caldwell and other top artists. ""Sunshine Alley"" conveys his compelling mix of jazz, rock, funk, and pop. And, musician by musician, his band is replete with terrific complementary artists who jell as tight as a well-strung guitar."
4,"Comprehensive, but...","This is a good comprehensive kit. It has all the sizes you're likely to need. However, since they are only Bi-metal bits they are a bit slow, especially in old wood. The no-tool bit removal works well and the the larger bits are easy to empty. You'll have a tougher time to empty the smaller bits. I would recommend this kit if you plan to occationally drill holes. I would not recommend it for daily use."
2,"Material is quality, but it the set has a key flaw.","I needed a hole cutter set and I have always appreciated Dewalt's quality.The centering drill bits don't extend past the cutting edge of the circle saw teeth, so its VERY difficult to keep the cutter from walking. Kind of irritating. I am trying to figure out a way to work around this but so far they're just gathering dust on my shelf right now."
4,Great Help,This book was very informative and encouraging at the same time. Real situations of people who have been there before and survived and even excelled afterwards is extremely encouraging!
4,A History of the World's Religions (13th Edition),This is a totally comprehensive book encompassing all that I need to know about the history of religion. Fully recommended reading.
4,Good,It was the book I needed and it was cheaper than at my campus bookstore. I wish it was cheaper tho
4,Great!,"The conditon of the book was awesome! There was a little bit of highlighting but I really don't mind. Otherwise, perfect!"
5,Good for a party,"A am a really big fan of Nukleuz tracks. I used to spin their lables at parties, and I always got a positive response from the crowds. This cd lives up to the standard that Nukluez has set. Obvoiusly, the beats are hard and really get me pumped. This cd is truely one of my favorites."
1,Don't Buy,This flatware is not balanced. Our very casual lifestyle includes eating away from the table which causes a problem with this flatware. The handles are too heavy causing the forks to flip off the edge of your plate. These forks would be a disaster in a buffet setting. Also the finish spots badly with slight rust. Poorly made from China. Our set is going in the next garage sale.
1,Onieda flatware,"We recently bought a few sets of Onieda flatware (Simba pattern) to replace 20 plus year old flatware. In just a few months spots of rust are starting to show on these pieces. This stuff was made in China. Inferior product. I am trying to return it and get my money back, but I'm getting a luke warm response from Onieda. I think you get what you pay for when it comes to flatware. I would suggest you look at other brands before buying Onieda flatware."
5,Lovely Product,We just ordered this from Amazon. The flatware is lovely. Each piece has a good weight to it; not too heavy or flimsly.
2,hose clogging,"Like another commenter, I have to say, beware of the hose clogging up. I bought it to maintain the cleanliness of the newly installed carpet in my apartment, and on the first use the hose clogged pretty much all the way up. It took an hour and a half of poking and prodding, and flushing under the tap in the bathtub to clear the clog of the carpet fibers. I haven't used it since, and I don't know if it will clog every time. Pay a little extra for a machine that doesn't rely on a hose for intake and suction; I just don't recommend this one."
3,Cheese Head,"We ordered this as part of a Halloween costume for my husband. Arrived quickly and was just as stated on the site. The hole where your head goes is very large and doesn't sit quite right on his head. Other than the size, the overall product is what we expected for an inflatable hat."
3,A CLASSIC ZORRO MOVIE,This Zorro movie is packed with whip cracking action.It has lots of swordplay in it to. If you like lots of action this is your movie.
4,"Great layout, photos, diagrams -- Organized well","This thin book is chock full of useful information for the person getting started with their first telescope.It is very well designed and organized, with tons of photos and diagrams, making it a fun read.I went to the bookstore looking for Star Ware when I found this book. Star Ware had absolutely no photos and had pages upon pages of technical jargon, whereas this book explained in interesting and simple terms the basics of telescopes, both in purchasing, setting up and using.I purchased the book and will keep it as a reference / guide now that I've read it.Recommended."
1,save your money,"This is garbage, there's no way to connect it to a camper wall, cheaply build, save your money. No instructions."
4,Great Book but .....,"okay, this book is totally awesome because it has a lot of useful information, but occasionally it gets so boring that you want to die. It can get really tedious, and repetative too. Overall, it's good though."
3,Reserve full judgment,"This is a tough one. I read the book and found it a remarkable read. It came across to me, an amateur, as authentic and seemed to ring true in regard to the detailed pains the sniper must take to get his kill while simultaneously avoiding becoming road kill himself. I have no idea whether the naysayers are sour grapes or really know that some of this is inaccurate research. One would think that if this is hogwash there would be more experienced military as well as military snipers who would write disparaging reviews on Amazon. So until I know for certain that the authors took liberties, I will only say that I enjoyed the book and it kept my interest throughout."
5,great book about sniping,Book covered many different accounts of sniping from nam to european snipers. Every chapter almost is about a snipers account. Great book all around. A must read for a sniper fan.
4,Which Author is Senkowski Talking About?,"Regarding the review written by Glen Senkowski, I would like to ask which author he is talking about? Sasser or Roberts? Roberts did not write the book he is describing about chopper pilots. Indeed, Roberts IS a chopper pilot, and a former Vietnam Vet Marine who served in the infantry and as a sniper in I Corps in 1966. It is true that Sasser has a tendency to add too much color to his writing and sometimes embelishes the facts, but in all One Shot--One Kill is a compilation of stories gleaned from personal interviews conducted by Roberts with the various men who tell of their experiences in this book. All interviews were taped, documented and checked for authenticity. Roberts later was an advisor to the History Channel's ""Suicide Mission"" series ""Snipers"" and ""Combat Medics.""I know Craig and can verify he is a meticulous researcher and investigative journalist. See his other books, ""The Medusa File,"" and ""Kill Zone."""
4,A fun reading about sniper development in U.S. military,"This book has a lot of good sniper stories in it. With these intensive and breath holding stories setting the mood, the authors further throw in more informative material about the sniper development in the U.S. armed force. The end result is a balanced book with interesting stories, as well as a good overview about the sniper system in the U. S. military today.If it has any shortcoming, I'd say it is in the part of limited coverage about WWII and Korea. Be noted that it is natural that Vietnam would get more coverage because, one, it is more recent and, two, it lead to the development of the current sniper system."
1,BS,"I bought this book then found out it regurgitated Soviet Propaganda concerning Major Koenig, Berlin Sniper School and the famous duel. I've read in many places that are very believable (like Vasily Grossman, Writer at War) that this just did not take place and cannot be verified anywhere. I refuse to read a book that fronts fiction as truth. If you are fiction, then say it."
5,This is a really good book,a friend of my grandfathers gave me this book to read. it was execellent! i am not one for war stories but snipers definatly interest me. there way of combat is a whole other world.. this book let's you in on some of it. i really liked the story about the sniper who found an enemy camp and spent like two weeks just pickin' people off from different areas of the surrounding woods.again a really good book
2,Disconnected and didn't hold my attention.,"An attempted copy-cat of good books that have been out for quite some time. Would recommend reading In the Crosshairs by Michael Lanning, Sniper by Adrian Gilbert, and Dear Mom: A Sniper's Vietnam by Joseph Ward, over this book."
1,Information is not accurate!,I know for a fact this author used an incident for which one man received a bronze star and told the story giving another man the credit. What else is not true in this book.
5,A Hidden Strength Rises Up,"Time after time, people find that one of the most valuable soldiers on the battle field is the sniper. Their simple motto of ""One shot: one kill"" is all they need to live by. The enemy's life is cheap. It only takes one bullet to kill him.I am not much of a book-reader, but this was quite possibly the most fascinating book I have ever laid eyes on. Chronicling the achievements of such men like Carlos Hathcock and John Fulcher put war in perspective for me. You never hear the one with your name on it. This lifestyle is hell, not glory. It's not one of those John Wayne movies where the good guy always wins. It's horrible and life-scarring, as illustrated in this book. I would gladly read it another ten times."
4,Snipers,"Good book for introduction to history of sniping and its development in US Wars and Conflicts. Traces history of sniping and provided personal stories of famous US snipers in history of our Wars. Easy read. Not as compelling as the Carlos Hathcock story ""Marine Sniper"" but does contain several of his famous shoots in the first person."
4,Not bad at all,"This was an interesting book that was written from the perspective of one who has actually done what they have written about. The author does an excellent job of describing his experiences as a top sniper for the USMC. The only fault I noticed was that it was too ""pro-military"". (I have read MANY books on the Vietnam conflict and have the perspective with which to judge this.)"
2,Poorly Researched,"Im sure this book is appealing to the comic book mentality of your average gun nut, but it is poorly researched and does in fact read like a Sgt. Rock comic book. A much better book by Craig Roberts is Police Sniper and it may of been his collaboration with Charles W. Sasser which dragged this book down. Case in point - The supposed sniper duel between Konigs and Zietsev was nothing but a Soviet hoax and never happened and yet Roberts goes on about it like it was the greatest encounter in the history of warfare."
1,OneShot One Kill,"To say this book was badly written would be the understatement of the century. I continued to read it thinking it couldn't get any worse.It did.If anyone gives you this ""book"" to read,give it back,it's that bad. I have to give it one star it seems. That's not fair to the book. It should be minus five stars."
1,Not the greatest design,"First, the cut is great because it fits perfect. However, it does not fold up for easy storage, you have to roll it up. This causes the ends to roll inward after a while. My Civic has a long windshield so they included suction cups in the middle of the sunscreen to hold it to the windshield so it will not fall. Well, the suction cups are fixed to the shield with plastic and break when you try to remove the sunscreen. After ""rigging"" them back into place they melt in the sun and deform to the point they no longer work. You have to have the suction cups for it to work. Very bad design."
2,Design does not work for the '06 Civic,"The dimensions are great but the shade material is not rigid. With the very large windshield in the 06 Civic, the shade will fall onto the dash even when using the sun visors to hold it in place. The 06 Civic needs a shade that is more rigid. Maybe a different material or some battens to make it hold its shape would solve the problem."
3,Fits the Civic's Large Windshield,"I bought this for my 8th generation Civic Coupe (2009) about six weeks ago because I was not aware of another option. It fits the Civic's large windshield perfectly and does it's job.However it's thick and nearly impossible to get rolled up and for it to stay rolled up. I kind of fold it up the best I can and shove it over the front seats so it can lay across the back seat when I'm driving. Fortunately I never have rear seat passengers as I'd have to put it in the trunk! It's not quick to use and if it's not a bright sunny day I won't even bother putting it up. No kidding!There has to be a better design out there, but if not and you want a sun shade for the Civic's large windshield, this is it."
5,Hollywood Rocks!,"This book is a top notch reference guide to the 80's and early 90's rock scene in Los Angeles, California. The amount of research that was done here is very impressive. There's a section of the book dedicated to each of the main Sunset Strip clubs as well as a few clubs that were off the Strip such as The Troubador and The Country Club. Excellent photos as well! Highly recommended if you're an 80's hard rock fan like I am."
2,Don't buy it!,"This is NOT the original Mariah CD single of either of these songs, so don't be fooled into buying it! This is a re-release of some of mariah's hits under the title ""Platinum Hits"". The cover art is just the album cover. There is nothing new on here, there are no remixes or B-sides, and it's not even the original single! I felt very gypped when I got mine in the mail. If you just want a copy of the songs then go ahead and buy it, but if you already have the albums there is no reason to bother with this. It's just Sony trying to squeeze more money out of their cash cow now that she has flown the coop."
3,Silly fun,"The Iron Eagle series of films was a silly premise, contrived to get the elements of ground combat, air action, and a tacked on mystery plot all in one movie vehicle. Unless you were really into seeing aircraft go thru the motions, it never quite worked. The 3rd in the series, reviewed here, is a thin plot and sop to politics in Latin America. If you like ""hardbody women""(as do I), and Rachel McLish in particular, then you may find this pretty hot(there are no nude scenes or even anything approaching that though). She was in great shape and was one of the true ""prima donnas"" of woman's bodybuilding. So, like her: buy it; else: don't bother.."
3,Best of the Lot,"Face it, the Iron Eagle movies were B-quality movies, but IE3 was the best of the lot. Any movie that features World War II fighters is sure to attract my interest. The plot of IE3, like the other IE movies, is quite shallow, and sometimes cliche. That still doesn't take anything away from the fine aerial battles between propeller planes and jets. Some folks have found it impossible that the former could take on the latter, but it has happened in real life."
2,And the Purpose of the Film Is???,"I enjoy good adventure movies and I don't think this one qualifies. I couldn't decide whether to give it 2 or 3 stars, I finally decided on 2, it's a weak story line. First the intro with the credits threw me off, I was expecting a typical intro, like the beginning of TV shows such as CSI or NCIS or other Iron Eagle movies. Instead it's done on a completely benign solid color background with no graphics and q-u-i-e-t music--very strange. I don't believe it's a typical Iron Eagle movie, I was never quite sure where the story line was going. There were some enjoyable humorous scenes with a Bill Cosby like actor who was totally out of place, he appears out of the blue with no background or info to weave him in, makes the viewer wonder if the wrong footage was put in... The whole movie is pieces here and there that seem to occur at random. Perhaps this film needed a different director...and producer...and cast...."
4,Aces High,"This has meaning to me as I was in Marana, AZ during the filming of this movie and got to meet Lou Gosset Jr. who is the finest of actors and a real gentleman. Seeing first hand, the vintage WWII fighter planes in action was awsome, especially the Zero. We had a part in shooting holes in a piece of an airplane fuselage on the set. The movie itself was the best of the Iron Eagle Series in my opinion."
4,The Last Tolerable Iron Eagle,"Iron Eagle III: Aces High is perhaps the last tolerable installment in the series. Starring Sonny Chiba and Fred Dalton Thompson among several other interesting actors, Iron Eagle III has some interesting character elements which weren't present in the other series. For the most part, Iron Eagle III is the most original of the sequels following Iron Eagle, and doesn't feature excessive use of inconsistent stock footage. The story seems to border on comedy at times, but isn't ridiculously insulting to the intelligence like Iron Eagle IV. Watch it if you need a good laugh or need an excuse to have popcorn. Or watch it with Flight of The Intruder and have a double-feature."
4,Requesting,I would like to know why this movie has not been released on DVD as the other 3 have been. If a person wants the whole series in one format they can't get it. Please consider releasing it in the same format as the other 3 as it is just as good a movie as the rest.
5,Awesome movie,"i loved this movie. it is absolutly jaw droping to see WWII era fighters go up agasint the modern jets of today. just a few minor detials that got me was how the main bad guy's plane. ws refered to as an ""Me262 'the plane that was going to win the war for germany'"" when in fact it was nothing close to the 262. other then that i foudn this movie very entertaining and deffenitly watch/buyable. i got it on VHS to wathc again and again"
5,Very well made just like a real tent.,My niece got this for xmas and her parents can't get her out of it. She drags everything into it as if it was her new home. She also loves the tunnel that is available for this item (sold seperately). Now uncle Shawn is the coolest uncle because he buys neat things.
3,Tent camping ... if it would hold up,"I got this for my 8-yr old girl who loves to be outside. I made a sleeping bag for her to unroll inside, and a lantern flashlight, along with a book, in sincere hopes of finding her reading in there. No such luck. It did last about a week in the rec room--with sometimes 4 kids sleeping in there at night (our kids are small)--before it was trampled by her best and worst comrade of all: her 10-yr old brother. One of the support poles snapped towards the top, rendering the whole thing useless. I could probably fix the pole, but it will likely be summer before I pull it out again. It is cute and and the fabric seems sturdy, and we had high hopes of her being able to use it outside as it's advertised, when we go motorhoming this summer."
4,Very Happy,"We bought this tent because we were going to a hotel & instead of making my 4 year old sleep on the floor (to save a little extra cash) I thought it would be fun to get her something to ""camp out"" in. She LOVED IT! when it arrived, i set it up & put her small TV in it, and some toys, she played all day, kept yelling how much she loved me. a few days later, we set it up in her room again for a ""test night"" she slept perfectly, had plenty of room, could fit a friend in there if she wanted a sleep over!!so far this tent has been very durable, we have fit many toys in it, no rips or tears.my only complaint is it's hard to keep the ""flaps"" open on the front, she doesn't want them shut at night."
3,For my dog,"I bought this for my dog as an indoor dog house. I live somewhere central heating is not available. The only reason I gave this product a three star, being nice by the way, was b/c the bottom part was torn."
3,Good and Bad,"I love the colors on this. The tent is pretty big...in fact I would say way too big. I thought this would be a nice little tent, but it takes up half the living room. I do like that it has a ""floor"" as many tents for children do not. So, not durable enough for outdoors and too big for indoors. Maybe if you have a dedicated playroom and 1/4 of the room to spare it will work. I can imagine it would be fun for older children to spend the night in during a slumber party."
5,Great deal,"Setup is quick and easy, breaks down into a tiny roll about 14 or so inches long and about 6 inches thick.Didn't see any built in way to hold the flaps open but didn't search too hard yet for anything not obviously visible.Not so overwhelming that it cannot be used in the house, which was where i wanted it for, a place my 6 year old can play fort. We already had a tunnel so he's in heaven.Not the most durable thing in the world, but for the price I wasn't looking for some nice canvas or anything..."
1,"guide book gives an unfair review of anaheim,CA","I think the book has some strange opinions. It actually likes Barstow,CA better than Anaheim,CA. Very strange. Purchase not recommended."
2,Bogus PRIZE,Not the Nobel Prize but only a movie about snow. The film which was expected was packaged incorrectly. It is not the 1963 movie but another about a prize for skiing. Be warned!
1,Poor quality dvd,"I bought this import dvd, big mistake, very poor quality, I just hope Warner Bros may bring this out, perhaps in their Archive Collection."
4,"Fun, Hitchcockian Thriller","A very underrated little Hitchcock knock-off, centered around the kidnapping of a brilliant scientist (Edward G. Robinson) at the time of the Nobel Prize ceremony. Paul Newman is Andrew Craig, a writer and prize winner who was reluctant to even come to the ceremony but becomes embroiled in the international intrigue (which, of course, no one around him believes is actually happening). Light and engaging, with several 'borrowings' from the ""North By Northwest"" script (which is allowed, I suppose, since they were both written by the same guy). Newman does a strange accent thing that goes in and out, but if you can ignore that it's a lot of fun and features a great cast."
4,"""The Prize"" remastered DVD","This DVD was a quality product. I wasn't too sure how a ""remastered"" DVD would be but now I can honestly say that I couldn't see any difference between this DVD and any of those I have which were purchased from a retail store. I have wanted this movie for years and finally found it through an Amazon partner. I will certainly look at this site for any future old movies that I can't get otherwise."
2,Not his best,"Fortunately, he became better as he got older. His character was not believable, and the story wasn't either. Try some of his newer efforts if you're a fan."
4,So Wie Du,So Wie Du is a really good German Cd. The sound is good also Nicole is the best German Artist I have heard so far.
2,Lasted 8 minutes!,"Well I wish I could rate this higher, my dog really loved it. Loved it too much as they say. It was his Christmas gift and it brought him pure joy. He squeaked and threw it into the air. Grabbing and shaking it with total abandon. The first hole showed up almost right away.A slight tear on one of the seams. The next hole on the dark blue bone was in the middle of the toy. The first squeaker to stop working was the orange one. It was worth his happiness, I just wish it would have made it a while longer. In it's defense my dog is a Bernese Mountain Dog who is all male and a maniac. The attack jack should be fine for more gentle dogs just not aggresive players and chewers."
4,Very colorful and fun,"Let me start with my 2 dogs - 85 lb & 70 lb and they sometimes entertain themselves and pull from 2 ends of a toy. Unfortunately, my dogs are on the larger end, so suffice it to say not much lasts long when they attempt this friendly fun of tugging. This didn't either - about 1 minute of that and it ripped at the seams. They can still play with it a bit, but not without supervision because of the stuffing. I still like it - if you have one dog or two that aren't quite that strong, go for it. If you are in my situation and are thinking, yeah...my dogs will probably tear that one up, they will. Sometimes I still don't mind and choose to ignore how much money I spend on these things."
1,Dog loved it but,It only lasted a month before seams gave up. My lab played with it every day for just under a month.
1,Weak seams,"I bought this for my 18 lb shih-tzu to play with (he loves squeekers). My 20lb boston terrier also played with it a few times. I was very disappointed that within 2 days, half of the seams were burst open and the stuffing was sticking out. Since this is sized for a larger dog I expected it to hold up well to our little ones. My dogs have stuffed toys that have lasted over a year without the seams splitting. Save your money and choose something else."
2,Not that great,"yes the cd may have some good bands on it, but the songs arent any good. drowing pools song is ok, but its not the best. and i can tell that system of a down, and mushroom head didnt write the songs they play on the cd, because they're not as good as their other songs on their own cds. so you can buy this cd if you want, but the only good song is coal chambers, but that song is off one of their cds. so i cant tell you what to buy, and what not to, but dont waste your money on this cd."
2,"Yay, numetal!","As if the movie wasn't ...[bad], it has to be accompanied by a ...[bad] soundtrack as well? Well, isn't that just great? The ""new"" Godsmack song, ""I Stand Alone"", is the feature track (they even managed to write the name into the movie), and listening to it just makes me laugh. Didn't this song used to be called ""Awake""? I swear, it's the same song, only with different lyrics, and more distortion. But then, what more could you expect from Godsmack?The rest of the album doesn't have much to offer, either. I like Nickelback, but this song isn't so great. The only really good ones are the Sevendust one, the System of a Down one, and the 12 Stones one. The rest is pretty uninteresting, and you know bands like Drowning Pool and POD are gonna stink to high heaven. The Creed song is ok...This is a good example of why soundtracks are usually not worth buying. Don't get this unless you frequently use the phrase ""Let the bodies hit the floor"". ..."
5,Incredible soundtrack! Movie-not so much,"OK, the scorpion king as a movie is a pretty predictable picture. But is does have some redeeming qualities. Karen Shenaz David for certain and of course this soundtrack. Actually I watched this movie because of the soundtrack. I had the music before the movie. Most of the songs are used for the credit roll but it was free on demand so i figured what the hay. Might as well watch it. I had to have this because of Sevendust, Injected, System Of A Down, and Godsmack. I had heard I Stand Alone on a friends playlist and saw that he got it from this soundtrack and with so many great songs and artists it was a no-brainer purchase.I can see you can get this for 1 cent from the marketplace. So why are you stalling?"
1,"another ""album""","Why is it that people feel the need to put songs that were nowhere in the movie on the soundtrack? I mean really, what do they do, extend the credits in order to play the album? If you're looking for the score, don't bother looking here. The only redeeming quality of this ""album"" is Creed, and Nickelback."
1,"Terrible!!!! ""Godsmack""?? ""POD""??","I just saw the movie, and I have to say that it lived up to my expectations. It wasn't as good as The Mummy Returns, but it was definitely entertaining. The music was the best part - John Debney's score is certainly as good as his last action score, Cutthroat Island.So why 1 star? NONE of the music on this 'soundtrack' is in the movie, let alone has anything to do with the movie. It's just a bunch of ...heavy metal bands playing noisy beats accompanied by someone screaming. That's not music.The ONLY reason this 'soundtrack' was released was to get MONEY. No other reason. Here's hoping for a 70 minute release with the REAL music."
1,Where is the score for this movie soundtrack?Songs only!,All the songs in this soundtrack are played at the end of the film during the credits. This is no songs etc during this movie. So where is the soundtrack score for this movie?
5,Excelente Stuff!,"A perfect combination of bands and songs. Those that are supporting THE ROCK should buy it! Yeah, The Rock Rules!"
4,Try it for free...,"...at rollingstone.com. You can stream the entire album for free, though I don't know for how long. It is by no means a groundbreaking album--it's straightforward, and exactly what you'd expect from the bands included. But, the quality of the tracks is excellent. The Hoobastank song is real strong. And the Rob Zombie/Ozzy song is also great. Highly reccomended for fans of ""nu-metal"" (Is that not the stupidest name for the genre? I mean, who came up with that??)"
4,12 Stones Most Excellent,Can't wait to hear the 12 Stones new cd. Sevendust also has a great song on this soundtrack.
5,Excellent compilation,"While I am a big rock mucis fan I usually don't buy these kinds of soundtracks...While shopping for CDs I picked this one up and seeing Hoobastank in the line-up I listened and absolutely loved it.My favorite song would have to be Streamline by System of a Down, it has it all: great lyrics, an excellent musical composition and guitar solo, and of course a magnificent singer to pull it together. While listening to only a couple songs from the whole CD I usually also listen to Losing my Grip by Hoobastank (which is a great song), Iron Head by Rob Zombie featuring Ozzy (I mean it's Ozzy!!!), Set it Off (Tweaker remix) by P.O.D. (I'm not a fan of rap but this is pretty good), also I Stand Alone by Godsmack (the song has a great music video).Overall I think it's worth the money, not sure if I want to se the movie though, The Mummy is not really a favorite of mine.I would also recommend bying the Queen of the Damned soundtrack!!!"
4,elementary statistics:A Brief Version,"Good Book. Modern, interesting examples that help the reader grasp the significance of the applications. Good investment. Can't wait to begin application in everyday life."
3,Last Of The Comanche Chiefs,"Detailed and factual, but dry reporting on the life of Parker and the Comanche tribe after the conflicts in Oklahoma ended, and they were confined to the reservation. Lots of good pictures. Probably of interest mainly to Oklahoma residents and descendants of Quanah Parker. For others, it's a pretty dull read."
2,hmmm...not my favorite,"I guess I disagree with all of the other reviewers. I couldn't read the whole book, I had to skim through to the end of it. By 100 pages I just could not get into it. I think the idea for the story is great, but the telling is not quite there."
2,Stains easily,"I ended up giving these to Goodwill after about a year. I'm a big coffee drinker and these stain very easily. No amount of soaking in bleach would get the stains out. If you use them for colorless liquids, they are fine."
3,"Vernon, leave your guitar at home.","I'm a Huge Blood fan, and love all of his music, but this record is a slight let-down. It's in no part due to James Ulmer's performance, but rather Vernon Reid's presence.James Ulmer's strength is his droning, moody A-tuned guitar with his strong and slightly-garged voice. If you've heard ""Birthright"" that's Ulmer at his best.Vernon Reid should remember to leave his guitar at home when producing Ulmer. Reid's 1,000 note-a-minute style just walks all over Ulmer. He is no blues player in the style that Ulmer is. Ulmer can play ONE note and weave it into a feeling. Vernon Reid is always in a race with himself. Combine that with the loud, overly-full production, and James Ulmer is drowned out and lost in the mix. Underneath it all is a great performance by Ulmer. But trying to listen to it through all of that noise is annoying."
3,Surprise for me...,"I have been a big fan of Ulmer's harmolodic guitar style since the 70's. I hated his singing style, though. I just couldn't stand him singing. I was always of opinion that James should refrain from singing for the good of all his fans and himself.I am also a longtime blues aficionado, since the 60's. That is another reason I couldn't stand Ulmer's singing the blues. He used to sound phoney and out-of-place.That said, I have to admit, that this record is, undoubtedly, his best vocal record so far. You either play harmolodic guitar, or you sing the blues. There is no middle ground here (as it used to be in his previous ""blues"" recordings).Overall, I am sad to see Ulmer's departure from the harmolodic guitar, but I am starting to appreciate his blues efforts."
5,Magnificent Performances of Pfitzner's and Strauss' music,"Along with his recent recording of Wagner's music with the Philadelphia Orchestra, this recording of Pfitzner's and Strauss' scores may be Thielemann's finest to date. Most noteworthy is the ebullient warm performance of Pfitzner's Palestrina from the Deutsche Oper orchestra, but I also enjoyed hearing two of Richard Strauss' lesser known works. I wholeheartedly recommend this CD as a splendid introduction to Pfitzner's music."
3,"I wanted to know something new, beyond the shackleton's book - south, but sometimes I think Worlsley had a great imagination.","Endurance: An Epic of Polar AdventureI wanted to know something new, beyond the shackleton's book - south, but sometimes I think Worlsley had a great imagination."
4,Civil War Introduction or Review.,"I have read many books on the Civil War, including Abraham Lincoln: The War Years, the four-volume work on which this book is based. It was still good for a ""refresher,"" and I think I gained a few insights or learned a few facts which, if I ""knew"" before, I had forgotten! I think it would also make a good introduction for someone who knew little about the Civil War. (Not everyone wsnts to start with Shelby Foote's massive work!)Del Hambley"
4,Shaolin's sharpest sword is back,"Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang. This is something that has been missing in hip hop for far too long. Dope MCS who have more than just a catchy beat. The fourth chamber master returns to give the Wu gambinos another platinum disc. Top notch production from the Genius himself this time and cameos from Masta Killa, Method Man and all of the other Killa Bees will keep ya head noddin for a long time. The only setback is that this disc is too short man, damn."
4,"The cd is simply bangin , beats , rhymes, everything.",It's good to see the wu expanding they're fan base. New producer arabian knight is bangin. hip hop fury is my favorite cut . also stringplay. whew gza is hot !!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,im dissapointed,"Im dissapointed by this album!! Some song like breaker breaker, 1112, publicity, and stringplay are hot, but its too short with way too many of wu's second line with performances that sont do anything for tha album. It seems like all wu do now is jus speak, not rhyme. GZA is good on tha album, but with all tha extras, he dosent make his presence felt enough. If u want some of tha best wu ever, pick up Liquid Swords intead, which is a great albulm wit tracks like Labels, Shadoboxin, killah hills, 4th chamber, bible, n all tha rest of em. Beneath tha... is good, but not even close to Liquid Swords."
3,still the WU but ....,as far as lyrics are concerned its straight hip hop. its a nice effort by gza but by all means cannot be compared to liquid swards. i really dont understand rza wasnt fully involved as he was with gza's first master piece. really want to know what would have happened if the album would have sounded like if it was the next chapter of siquid swords rather than a whole new book.
3,"Dissapointment, but Still Dope","This is a huge step down from Liquid Swordz, but it is still pretty dope. The production is pretty weak on some tracks (the boring repetetive ""Crash Ya Crew""), but GZA is a lyrical master and he will never fall off with his lyrics. I hope his next album is better than this one."
4,One of the better Wu-Tang solo albums out there,"The GZA is one of the hottest emcees the wu tang family and this album, although it is no Liquid Swords, it still has some bangin beats and showcases an intelligence that is something to marvel at. If you like Wu-Tang, you're guaranteed to like this one."
3,Ok en ESPANOL,Mira corillo hablo claro desde PUERTO RICO... Si es que alguno de ustedes es un FAN the WU bien a fuegote... este CD 'ta ready es como que en verdad las canciones que menos me gustaron fueron las primeras 2... el resto estan duras... pero en realidad nada inovador (ese es el backtrip)
2,IT SUCKS,"Well now that I got your attention, this album does not suck but it is not even remotly close to his first album. I am truly sick and tired of seeing 5 stars for practically every album that comes out. Face it, RZA has fallen off and the production on this album does not make this album worth listening to. Mc's need to take their time to make albums instead of rushing it. After Wu-Tang Forever, the wu has takan a turn for the worse."
3,Could be a bit betta,"the numba of understanding. i luv the real Hip-Hop as much as the next man, but i feel like the gza was just experimenting with this album. i know the gza is a lot better lyrically in the liquid swords album. he somewhat fell off in beneath the surface. but he climbs back up in the legend of liquid swords. Knock Knock, who the f*ck is bangin @ my door!? yeah."
2,horrible production= a waste of a good lyricist,RZA pleeeeeease come back!!! The Wu is steadily falling off due to these weak producers!!! Now all the hip hop fans have abondoned the Wu and all the commercial Ruff Ryder fans are embracing this garbage!
3,another level,"I just wanna post some couple of thoughts on this album. The best cut is defenitly the titeltrack, which contains one of the most complex rhymes I ever heard and probably ever will. If ya listen that sound, it's like heaven. The melody is from outer space (While others say Deck is a wack producer). Then get to VICTIM and MIC TRIPPIN which feel like fallen leaves get blown over the street. There's no bad track at all, but ain't no fire. The production is too perfect, the rhymes are marvellous but too less emotion, like the beats are not heavy enough, knahmean. GZA put a lotta work on it. It's like another level, something higher. I really don't feel that. He shoulda dropped the album in autumn. It would match better to songs like VICTIM, and would give it a better atmosphere, not like that kinda sunnywackbeach style."
5,the gza genius,"dis is very well produced, phat tunes,BOUT 18 TRACKS 12 SONGS U KNO A LIL SUMTHIN SUMTHIN FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY DATS BOUT IT FOGET WUT I WAS A GONNA SAY"
3,not the greatest,"well if u like the wu than i suggest that u get it ull definetly like it but the gza isnt that gr8 yeah the rza makes em sound ok but listen have u ever really listened 2 the lyrics, they dont really flow....anyway i wouldnt suggest it for the non-wubangers"
4,This CD has got some of the tightset beats in Wu history!,"This CD is sick! The beats are tight as hell. The message that he puts across in a few of his songs are really strong. There are only three problems: the first is that the CD is too short (Only 46 min.) Second, there are too many skits on the CD. The space used for the skits could have been used for even more tight raps. And third, the song ""Crash Your Crew,"" is a waste of space. The beats on this track sound like some kinda 1980's Funk Master Flex crap. Besides that, it is one of the best Wu-Tang CD's I have heard. Can't wait for Gza's fourth CD, coming out in Dec. '99. Buy this CD!"
5,Not as creative as Liquid Swords but well worth the $$$,"Albums like this should be sold for more then 15 or 18 dollars.Why? Because so much work is put into albums like this. If you look at a Jay Z album or DMX album.. how much work do you think is really put into that album? Think about it. Gza put countless hours into this work of art, you would be wrong to say he didnt.Production is off the chats, not as groundbreaking as the production on Liquid Swords, but well above the average production these days.Gza comes out hard with super serious sick lyrics and mind looping metaphors. Gza is not my favorite emcee of all time, but he is the greatest of all time, ...Closing statement, get this damn album."
4,"Solid, but not as good as Liquid Swords","Don't get me wrong, this was a great CD, but it just didn't have the punch of Liquid Swords. GZA is one of my favorite Wu members and I don't want to give him disrespect, but I actually became bored with Beneath the Surface pretty quickly. The songs are too short and a bit repetitive. There are some great tracks though laced within the CD. The beat for the intro and outro was great, I wish they'd used it for a longer song though. Breaker, Breaker is good as well as Publicity, which has a great beat. Feel Like an Enemy is also commendable. I appreciate that GZA allowed the less known wu-member Masta Killah and sunz of man's Killah Priest to have guest appearances on the CD. I'm not saying this is a bad CD, it was just too short and didn't match up to Liquid Swords."
4,best wu album of the year,"i dont kno why the absense of the RZA on BENEATH THE SURFACE is such a big deal. the beats on this b1tch were beautiful. not as good as LIQUID SWORDS...but what second album is better than the first? this is one of those albums where you can listen to it straight through and only skip the skits like most albums. GENIUS is still the lyrical swordsman he always was on beats like BREAKER BREAKER, HIP HOP FURY, PUBLICITY, N THE TITLE TRACK. and i dont kno wut the f**k is wrong with all of you. its like u all jus skipped track 16 - FEEL LIKE AN ENEMY....one of the best mothaf**kin tracks i hav heard in a while...n the GENIUS aint even on it...dont matter tho...cause B.I.B.L.E. didnt hav the GENIUS's razor sharp presence either..."
1,dungis' review,"i am an avid wu follower, and i used to be a huge gza fan, but i believe if it ain't broke, don't fix it. what i mean by this is, the gza's lyrics are tight as hell, but his delivery on this album is garbage. it's like he's tryin' to be busta ryhmes, in the sense that he tries to rhyme almost every word, and it don't sound nothing like his liquid swords album, which is classic. i'm sorry, but this album is not up to my standards."
5,THIS TAPE IS DOPE,A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY DONT KNOW WHO THE GZA IS ALL I GOTS TO SAY IS HE'S ONE OF THE BEST MC'S FROM WUTANG LISTEN TO HIS TAPE COMPARED TO METHOD MAN AND THE BOBBY DIGITAL AND YOU'LL SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT I HOPE THE OTHER WU MEMBERS DON'T SLACK OUT AND KEEP UP WITH GZA PEACE OUT.
4,The GZA is back!!!,"The Wu produce another Wu-Banger; The Man, the Gza is still spitting hard lyrical darts. We all knew tracks Breaker&Publicity were tight.But Amp.Sample,Crash Your Crew & High Price also had tight lyrics. Good Wu emcees appear on the bangin HipHop Fury and Feel Like An Enemy. Overall the cd is tight, the lyrics&sound are great like always from the Gza. The problems are the cd is too short and please skip the pointless wack skits I don't know why there on the cd. So buy it Wu-fans! Also The Wu-Era is not over son."
3,LIQUID SWORDZ EVAPORATIN?,"Come on now... all of these five starz aren't necessary. This album iz not a classic. It doesn't even compare to Liquid Swordz. True, the lyrical content is somewhat there, but the beatz? I'm not sayin' all of the tracks are mediocre, but most of them are. Seems like the Wu sound we all grew to love has been digitally commercialized to go along with most of everyone else in the rap industry. They're not pioneers anymore, just rappers. I thought GZA would save them being that Liquid Swordz was the best all around solo album Wu has yet to release. Guess I'll just have to wait and see what RZA's real solo project, ""THE CURE,"" is going to sound like. The Wu needs a cure. BITERS!!!"
4,Gza/genius..,dont look deep into this LP just get it and listen to the beats and production.. GZA does his best work here and Im a believer with this album..does justice to the Wu ...but I dont know about the new album..we'll see
3,gza,"the gza's second album is not as good as his first one,liquid swords,but it satisfies the hardcore wu tang fan.for me it wasnt that good.the beats were not that good to start with and it had a commercialized feeling to it.the only good songs were ""breaker,breaker"",""amplified sample"",and ""hip hop fury"".the rest of the songs are so-so.it also has four skits that werent neccesary.this cd is also enhanced but its very confusing and i still dont know what the hell it does.only get it if your a hardcore wu tang fan."
4,HIP-HOP IMPAIRED BEWARE!,"I'm not claiming to be the messiah of hip-hop like some of you jokers but for all those that keep saying the wu fell off, stop buying the albums then! Let's face it the reason you keep buying the albums is because of the stamp of quality""W"". As bad as any wu album is, it is still better than 90% of the s#!t out there. The only thing i can listen to other than the wu is underground stuff. As for this album i think this is one of the premier wu albums created yet. And i have every single one. I think it is just as good as liquid swordz but in a different way. When liquid came out we had no expectations for gza. Now that he and rza created a classic your looking to be caught off guard again. Just enjoy the music. It's as good as it gets. ONE."
5,"Haven't heard, love it.","I like the Wu Tang Clan, and this CD is great, I guess. Who knows, I'll buy tomorrow."
2,Razr V3 swivel clip,Shipping was timely. I got exactly what I ordered. Upper clips do not grab the side of my V3 very firmly resulting in phone popping out occasionally.
3,Pretty good covers,"I have to commend the bands for picking some good songs to cover, but this is not the best set of covers I've heard. I've definitely heard worse, but I had high hopes for the covers of such a great band. My favorites are Pebbles and X-French Tee Shirt, and I would listen and download your favorites."
4,Humor Delivered by Thrusts of a Rapier,"This may not be the funniest book that I have ever read, but I sure can't think of a funnier one! Throughout its zany plot, David White never misses a chance to skewer his targets with his rapier of humor. All the while we are laughing, we can't help but be struck by the inciseveness of his observations and the deftness with which he draws each character and each situation. Anyone who has been reading a newspaper or watching TV over the past eight years can put a face on every character and marvel at White's skill as a literary caricaturist. White includes a long list of targets for his thrusts and it is a delight to see them painted in their true colors."
2,Boring,So much more could have been done with this topic. Was not impressed with the production or the quality of the re-enactments.
5,Firewire Cable,"Outstanding service and a great product! Also, had the lowest price I could find online. I would definitely buy here again."
2,First things first,"Look, this is not a bad book, but trying to adopt the mental traits of champions as outlined here is about as useful to the beginning and average golfer as wearing the same gloves as Tiger, or the same colored golf bag as Palmer.The mental side of golf is important-but not as important as this book leads you to believe.It's really simple. You probably won't be a pro-or a Rock Singer or a Movie Star-get over it. But..if you want to be as good as you can be....Be prepared to put in the time. Be coachable. Be prepared to endure plateaus. Stick with it. Don't succumb to the siren song of gimmics and shortcuts.Don't compare yourself to others, just try to improve every day.Golf is a game that is learned and perfected by gaining automaticity through consistent perfect practice. You need feedback. Hire a pro that knows the game."
5,Best book on the mental game ever written,"This book is probably the best book on the mental game ever written. It rates with Tim Gallowey's ""Inner Game of Tennis"". I don't know if it's sad or funny that it only has 10 reviews on Amazon. I guess it's the best kept secret in golf. It's full of actionable, specific suggestions and techniques. I will admit I had some difficulty reading the book at first. I struggled with it until I actually made an outline of the 8 traits and the techniques the authors suggested for developing each one. It was more work than simply breezing through a easy to read treatise but like most things in life, I got out of it exactly what I put in. I went from shooting in the 90's to shooting in the mid-70s in a little over a year. This book played a role in that improvement; especially when playing in big tournaments. Do yourself a favor and read this book and focus on improving each trait in your competitive play as well as your life. You will reap huge dividends."
3,Groovy Baby,"ok well I'm 15 and I thoroughly enjoyed this book, it was romantic sweet and interesting. at the moment my nana has the story and i keep telling mum to tell her to give it back but my nana loves it too much as well! i suggest u buy it...NOW"
2,Why!,"First of all I am a huge fan of bodice rippers.I purchased this book thinking it was going to be a super awesome non-pc bodice ripper. It was that up until... (SPOILER ALERT)The heroine gets raped by the bad guy! What the heck was that! I hate books like these,and yes I know it was written in the Rosemary Rogers era(I couldn't stomach her books either) but why? It just ruined the book for me. I read the reviews but don't remember reading about her getting raped by other men and so purchased the book online, so for those who don't like rape of the heroine by other males don't purchase this book. I feel the need for those who like bodice rippers without the heroine rape by others need to be informed that this book has that element."
1,horrible,"I have read almost every book Ms. Busbee has written but this was the worst! I do not like to read about raping or beating women. There are no redeeming qualities about the ""hero"". I was truly disappointed by this book. I think I will go read A Heart For The Taking agin!"
1,Not A Romance,"He kidnaps her and rapes her. Smacks her around. Rapes her some more. She escapes and is with another man. He follows her. Smack her around. Rapes her some more. She escapes again. He follows her. Smacks her around. They kiss. The end.Can we say Stockholm Syndrome?Awful, just awful."
4,Typical 1970s/80s Romance,"A traditional bodice ripper - I enjoyed the novel, but it was definitely dated and there is the frustration factor of the constant misunderstandings."
3,I've read better,"Catherine Tremayne's aristocratic lovliness was a flower no man had yet dared to pluck. But when Jason Savage first beheld the violet-eyed beauty, she was disguised as a Gypsy-a maiden long ago stolen from her father's Cornish estate. Only after he had carried her off to Paris on a dangerous mission for President Jefferson did Jason bare Catherine's secret. Yet Catherine's destiny drew her on, into a world of intrigue and danger, and she fled fron Jason to the city of New Orleans-through an odyssey of peril and sexual captivity-to ecstatic reunion with the fearless adventurer who at last would quench the fire in her burning Gypsy soul. I have read much better work fron Shirlee. But we must remember this book was wrote in the 70's when it was cool to read about the torn bodice and viciousness of the main male character. At least Catherine had spunk! But the pride thing from both of them! Give it a rest and just talk! They presumed too much through the whole book."
3,"Ambitious, heavy-handed","Turner has some interesting perspectives to share (about everything from global warming to human nature, which of course are intertwined), and this book is often thought-provoking. However, his approach could be subtler; he repeatedly hits the reader over the head with blunt opinions.I haven't read that many dystopian novels, so I can't place this one fully in context. But it was relentlessly depressing, frequently overwritten (characters often thought or spoke in obtuse literary-ish ways), and long. By the time I finished it, I only dimly remembered the initial present-time setting from which the rest of the book was one long flashback.Quite an undertaking, a book of this magnitude, and intellectually stimulating, but overall less satisfying than it could have been."
4,Good book!,"The author of this book invokes the future with realism and intrigue. The book is about human overpopulation and how culture interacts more than the melting of the polar caps and the rising of Earth's oceans. The characters were realistic to the point of being frightful. I hope that as a race we realize that we do have control over our future. If you want a book that makes you think, this is it"
5,Great dive watch,"I've used the Hyper Aqualand for about 5 years and have been very pleased with it. I don't use it as a dive computer, but it's a great supplement to your dive computer. As an underwater photographer it's much easier to get information such as depth and duration of dive from my wrist versus finding my computer. True it's a big watch, but the expandable band will fit over your wetsuit. The digital readouts make it much easier to use than any others I've seen."
5,PC saved,"My laptop battery had outlived most of it's life and I was permanently connected to the power cord. Recently, the powercord transformer box started chirping and that went dead. I ordered the HP battery and a new power cord and couldn't be more pleased. The battery fits perfectly, holds a charge like the original battery did. I will no longer abuse the battery power and will keep it hooked up to the power cord unless necessary. Delivery on the battery was quicker than the power cord. Thank you so much!"
5,"Very good controller, Don't fear buying this controller","I had seen reviews of apparently the PL-2050's forerunner and they were very poor. (Both the reviews and apparently the product too) But, the PL-2050 is a very nice controller. It feels a lot like the stock xbox controller, in both quality and function. I think I like the button location better on the PL-2050 than the stock controller and there is no noticeable lag Vs the wired controller.The only ""con"" I can come up with for the PL-2050 is that I wish the RF receiver had a slightly longer cord. But, that is a very minor complaint.I am tempted to get a second PL-2050 so my 1 year daughter will not have any cords to pull on. :-)For the $ you can not beat this controller for a wireless controller."
1,Never waste you'r money on a pelican controler!,"I don't care what those other people said.They break in a few days!!!!And if you don't listen,then fine waste you'r money on a piece of crap like that.But you where warned."
1,Not very happy,I was not very happy with my purchase. The bits weren't as sharp asthey should be. They do not cut very well. Also the case they came in was broken.I'm not sureI'll order again.
3,forstner bits,received my set quick fast and in a hurry but as of now have not had an occasion to use it.
3,"Drill bits are straight and precise, but dull, prepare to sharpen.","First thing I noticed out of the box is that the bits are visibly dull.Even to bare eyes the cutting edges look frayed, like a wood chisel that really needs sharpening.As a consequence this new forstner bit does not cut as fast as a Freud bit I have used for years. (Even though the design and shape are almost identical to the Freud.) The bottom of drill holes in pine shows tearout and some fraying.I have tried to sharpen a bit with a dremel, this improves things. This can take 5 minutes per bit.Why not 1 or 2 star? I suspect that after sharpening you still end up with a drill bit that lasts better than a cheaper version. Cheaper ones of course may be dull(er) as well. More importantly, these bits are straight and precise so they don't wobble like cheaper ones."
4,Decent bits for the money.,"These are decent bits for the money. They are not as good as buying a set of Freud HSS bits, but I could not afford a set of Freuds either. I have drilled a lot of holes with these, even abused a few of them by drill into aluminum. They are all still working!I took them to my sharpener, and he told me they were not worth sharpening, so when they start to cut too poorly, I will probably buy another set just like them.Is there any difference between these and the next step down from the junk tool store? I don't know, but these have served me well. I have a few Freud that are HSS and Carbide tipped, and the difference is substantial. However, we are talking about single bits that cost more than this entire set!"
1,Horrible Bits!,"These have got to be the worst forstner bits I've used to date. I had noticed upon removal from the packaging that ALL of the cutting edges were not just dull, but spawled, chipped, and looked to have been sharpened with a wood rasp. (My lawnmower blades have a crisper edge!) These bits are definitely not fast, sharp, or worth your money if you are serious about your tools. -no stars today Chinese made Porter Cable-"
5,forstner bit set,"I used most of the bits already and they are super sharp with clean holes.nice case too, what more can i say."
5,Peterbilt Trucks 1939-1979,"Thorough History and wonderful pictures. If you love trucks, as I do, I would highly recomend this book and any other book containing Ron Adams photographs."
2,How to solve fairly easy sudoku,"I've been doing SuDoku puzzles for years and have beaten every level of the video game version Carol Vonderman's (PS2). Still, I wanted to be able to solve the really tough puzzles so I figured a book such as this would help. It's worthless unless you've never tried the game before. It has NOTHING about the advanced techniques like X-wings and Swordfish which are necessary to do the VERY hard ones. The book is very short, too; less than 100 pages. I suggest you save your money, do the easy ones, get practice, and go to the web for forums and sites which tell how to do the tough puzzles because the methods in this book aren't adequate, trust me!"
2,Very basic,"This is a book for beginners at Sudoku. It helps on how to begin to organize oneself when tackling the puzzles for the first time. However, it is not helpful once one moves on to more difficult levels."
4,Good basic instructions,"This book has good basic instructions for solving Sudoku puzzles. It only gets 4 stars because it didn't go beyond the early intermediate stages and I would have liked an explanation of more advanced strategies. It doesn't get less than 4 stars because it does an excellent job of teaching what it does teach.I've been doing Sudoku puzzles for years, and even I found some things in the book that I hadn't quite thought of exactly in the way they explained. My strategies have changed as a result of reading it. If you are a beginning you will find beginning and intermediate puzzles easy to do if you follow what the book teaches."
2,Disappointing,"I excel at logic games. I had hoped to learn something useful with this book. It advertises itself to be a step-by-step guide. However, about half way through the book, on page 33, it says, ""Since you're now more familiar with the ideas, we'll give less explanation in what follows.""Then it proceeds to just give statements telling you that certain numbers belong in certain boxes of the exemplar puzzle, without telling you how the author arrived at that conclusion.I would not recommend this book to anyone. It leaves a lot to be desired."
2,How to Solve Sudoku: A Step-by-Step Guide,Not much help. I still have problems with the hard Sudokus.
1,52 Brilliant Ideas,This gives the impression you are going to be taken through the whole gamut of techniques right to the most difficult. In fact 52 is the numbers (1 to 52) marked on the subsections in what amounts to 2 or 3 main sections in the book and the few methods described hardly pass those needed for a moderate puzzle. Marking in actual possibilities is only mentioned in the end of the book in relation to a brief mention of doubles and triplets. The book is strictly for beginners and is a complete waste of time for anyone who has any proficiency. There are almost no brilliant ideas and the title is completely misleading. I passed the level of this book within the first few days of doing puzzles. The book was a complete waste of money for me.
2,Disappointed,"This is an ok book, but the description given led me to believe that it covered advanced solving techniques. It doesn't. Also the practice puzzles are small and difficult to work within. Also, there is no level of difficulty given for the puzzles. A much better book is Carol Voderman's ""Master Sudoku."""
2,Very poor on twins and triplets,"This A6 size book(HtoSS} while OK on basic scanning techniques ,is very deficient on twins and triplets,but these are what you need to solve the difficult puzzles in mags, books, and papers. You need to know the how, when, and where of these and all variations.This book only has one instructional diagram on them, seeming to just mention them in passing. The only easy to understand guide that covers them properly is 'So Do Sudoku' (SDS) which has ten instructional diagrams on them.Also the intermediate technique in HtoSS is covered easier and better by an alternative scanning technique in SDS. All these books have been said to be useless by people who assume everyone else is up to their level, when in fact these books are written for the majority of people who struggle with the puzzles in general circulation, and contain tips to help you complete them. None of them are useless to the right people ,but some are better than others."
4,"Clear, Well-Organized How-To Guide for Sodoku","This guide is well organized and easy to follow. Mr. Wilson offers several puzzles for you to apply what you've learned as you go. I now find myself solving the most of the hardest puzzles I come across using just the techniques learned in this little book. Mr. Wilson says, ""Using these little numbers [the final technique he demonstrates] you should now be able to solve all but the most difficult puzzles."" Instead of taking you all the way, Mr. Wilson points the way to other resources, in case you want ""to hone your sudoku skills further."" (He particularly recommends a newspaper article by Hugo Rifkind in ""The Times"" of 14 May 2005.)"
3,intended for beginners,"It's great that the author illustrates solutions step by step, but the book is intended for beginners. If you have no idea how to solve sudoku, this book is an excellent place to start. It won't, however, get you beyond the easy puzzles. I'd like to see this author apply the same step by step illustrated solutions to difficult puzzles requiring advanced techniques."
5,Extremely interesting and comprehensive discussion.,"The book goes through the causes of color in a very well organized manner. The author discusses incandescence, fluorescence, phosphorescence, ligand field theory and all other causes of color. It is written so that any reader with a bachelors degree in chemistry or physics could easily understand it. It contains very informative appendices. I highly recommend the book to science types who are interested in color and its causes."
5,A very readable treatment of the subject,"Nassau succeeds in presenting a very readable treatment on the causes of color in natural and synthetic materials. He strikes a good balance between technical detail and ease of digestion, and leaves the more complex material for appendices.The volume is enlightening, informative, fairly complete and enjoyable reading, even for those casually interested in the subject."
3,movie,this is a gem of a movie cute characters and mildly scary ghost but in a hot sort of way always wondered why dead people have clothes.
3,"Along with others - ""A GOOD (not Great) MIDDLE BOOK""","I felt a lot of the ""survival"" tension from the first book was lost in this one. There were a few too many drawn out battle scenes for my taste, but all in all, still glad I bought and read it. I hope the next installment comes soon. I'm intrigued to see if he develops/integrates the group that left for the West Coast (which gets minimal coverage in this book)into the Nantucketters survival in the next book. Interesting possiblities there."
4,Stirling continues the Nantucket series in fine style!,"What's not to like? Time travel/alternate history tale with plenty of action, compelling characters, and an unpredictable storyline. Loved it!"
4,very good,"I have enjoyed the entire series, but, the Nantucket one should be read before the Change series. Or at least the first one. I wound up reading them at the same time, which was pretty interesting..."
4,"This is a better buy than you think, reading other reviews","I've read most of the other reviews. To cut to the chase, who carea about the sexual politics? It's just another view of thw way things might be. Who cares if the RON ""gets it right"" all of the time. This is escapist literature. Suspend disbelief! Did you like the read, 'cause I did? Most of negative reviews miss the point. Is this book clever? It is. Are there unsusual viewpoints and ways of looking at things expressed? There are. Is it is enjoyable to read? It is. Whay more do you want for the price ?"
4,"Dust, Mud, and Waves","What a relief to be reading a tautly-written science fiction novel where I can actually identify with some of the characters directly, rather than having to pretend. Interracial lesbian moms in an assistant leadership position: great stuff.I was interested to see all the commentary on why women weren't originally included in military ventures, and I had to snigger, remembering how much larger, on average, Nantucketer women would be than most of the population of the world at that point, even before one begins adding in martial arts hobbies.To possible readers I will say this: 1. Read the first book first. 2. Leave any bigotry at home. 3. Provide yourself with snacks, and make sure you hit the bathroom first!"
3,Historically Thoughtful; Politically pushy,"A great book if you can get past Mr. Stirling's opinionated references to such political doctrine as one's sexual preference or opinions about religion. However, it is a good book overall."
2,Disappointing sequel to a great first book,"After being thrilled with the first book of this series, Island In The Sea Of Time, I bought both sequels together and buckled myself in for a helluva ride. If only that's what I got. In this second book the plot slows down substantially, and I was frequently bogged down in nautical jargon that I found baffling. I didn't end up finishing this - I gave up and got a summary of the plot on google!"
2,Disappointing,"The plot slows to a crawl....................I read Island in one weekend. I put this sequel down three-quarters of the way through and have little desire to pick it back up. Short of increasingly complicated froreign entanglements, nothing much has happened since the end of the first book. You might be well advised to skip this segment altogether and wait for number 3."
3,More of the same.,"I like the series but found that this book became somewhat tediously bogged down with detail. That detail, however, is what makes the novel so much fun. I have very mixed emotions but did continue reading. The characterizations start becoming vivid, perhaps more so in this book than the previous. My problem is that there are so many characters to track that I get confused. I think he did a better job in the ""Change"" series."
5,SUPERB STORYTELLING !,"This second installment of the Nantucket trilogy provides readers with breathtaking battles, surprising plot twists, phenomenal characterization, and irresistable historical insight. In my opinion, the Nantucket trilogy is turning out to be the most fascinating time travel/alternate history series of all time! I am already very anxious for the third installment -- entitled ON THE OCEANS OF ETERNITY -- to be released next year."
5,S.M. Stirling writes another great novel!,"An excellent sequel to Island in the Sea of Time, which is a great book by itself. The Nantucket trilogy so far is surely among the best books I had the occasion to read. I enjoyed the depiction of the Bronze Age peoples and cultures, dead for millenia, but now living again due to the precise research and admirable depiction skills of the author.There are some points I would have liked detailed in the book, such as a more detailed account of the Girenas expedition and the peoples it encountered. More Tartessian POVs could also have been added, leading to a deeper understanding of this people and their goals. Maybe the third book will present such things. Some nitpicks, the dates presented in some chapter headings aren't always in the good order, or refers to parts that have been deleted, which led to some confusion. A more thorough editing work would have been nesessary, I believe.All in all, a book you'll probably read more than once, or twice!"
2,So promising but why all the lesbian stuff?,"I had enjoyed Island in the Sea of Time so much, and was delighted to see a sequel had come out. I made it halfway through this book, but was so repulsed by the constant referral to lesbian activities that I put it down. What a shame that the writer for some reason had to shove lesbianism down the readers' throats."
1,"Stirling is a good author, but...","This and the other two books in the Nantucket trilogy are excellent, but there is a good deal of totally unnecessary objectionable material in all three books. He gives...descriptions of...sexual acts...None of [the] graphic sexual relationship or any of the off-color language that he litters his books with are even remotely related to the plot...Apparently, the last thing that a person or animal does when they are killed is defecate...There is a lot of killing in these books and he just loves to write about how they ""void"" before they die. He must have written that hundreds of times in the books. He also loves to tell of the stench of defecation that is present at the scene of a killing or battle....If all of what I just mentioned isn't offensive to you, then you should read all three books."
2,A Picture Book,"This is mainly screenshots with a few words thrown in between. I am still looking for some helpful information. Also, half of the book covers DVD MovieFactory instead. I am now looking for another book with substance."
3,Not the best or the worst.,"Players of Gor is neither the best not the worst of the Gor series. While it has an excess of dialog about woman slavery, it does have its good moments. There ample action and humor."
4,Pretty interesting concept for a romance novel.,"The idea of ""time travel"" is pretty interesting in this genre and it's certainly not a subject that's overdone. (I can only think of one other author that's attempted it successfully and that would be Johanna Lindsey.) Small takes her time with it and creates a rather unique tale. I agree that Madoc being unable to find his wife after she's kidnapped is far-fetched - after all, he's supposed to have magic, right? - and I think that more should have been done with the tale of Rhiannon and Pwyll - but the book has its good points. She's certainly written worse. (i.e., Unconquered, The Spitfire, etc.)"
1,horrible horrible horrible!,"I totally agree with cherylintn's review...I read this book years and years ago and just like cherylintn, it remains the worst romance novel I have ever read. The entire middle of the book wasn't my idea of romance at all but when I read the ending I actually threw the book across the room into the wall I was so disgusted. ROMANCE, Ms. Small, ROMANCE! This book is a travesty! Why bother having a hero when you just wasted him? I don't want to spoil the ending Ms. Small managed to spoil all on her own just writing the horrible thing but I don't suggest reading this one."
4,Great example of reincarnation!!,"I found this book packed away amongst all my other books and couldn't resist the urge to sit down and read it! I love the way Ms. Small delves into reincarnation---by taking us back to when Wynne and Madoc first met. Another thing that I found fascinating was the way she described Wales and England. I have to admit that I was a little lost in all the different pronunciations for the characters in this book----but once I figured them all out, it was very easy reading."
3,A tear jerker...,"I love books like this--and have found only a paltry few that made me feel so swept-away as this magical novel. A departure from Small's usual books, this was magical, mystical, exciting, romantic and thoroughly satisfying--in spite of the ending--which I will not give away except to say that it was both happy and sad--bittersweet at best. (And the one thing that stopped me from rating this higher)The love scenes were okay--I kind of glossed over them--the story was that good!The villain was a bit over the top--but it was a fantasy so I could run with it.And the hero was one of my all time favorites--could Ms. Small write another book with another hero like Madoc?"
1,The WORST book I've ever read,"I read this book SEVERAL years ago when it first came out in hardcover, and it still holds top honors on my ""Horrible Book"" list. I couldn't believe the other reviews giving this book/author such accolades. We must not have read the same book! A romance should leave the reader wishing they were the hero/heroine and wishing they could live their lives. This was the most empty and depressing book I've ever had the misfortune of reading. It left me disgusted with both main characters for being such twits. And it has the most frustrating ending I have ever read. If you ever see this book on a shelf, do not walk away from it... RUN!"
3,Good but...,"This fragrance smells nice, but it's one of those scents that an older, mature/sophisticated woman would wear. My sister and I both thought it probably won't appeal to young girls. I gave it a three star because I don't think it fits me either, but my sister loved it!"
5,A MUST!,I ORDER ONE OF THESE EVERY YEAR JUST FOR THE BEAUTIFULPICTURES! I HOPE THEY NEVER END!SHARYN WHITING
3,Book Synopsis,"Publisher: ZebraPublish Date: May 1994Book Description:The beauty Elena was captivated by Mark's swarthy good looks, but she knew she wasn't the only woman who couldn't resist his charm.Would the son of one of California's wealthiest vintners marry a humble fisherman's daughter?"
3,OK book.,"mathStatica, a software bundled with this book, is probably a very good software. I was not very happy with the way the authors and the publisher structured the mathStatica license, particularly with newer and improved versions of Mathematica and the limited use of the software. The Mathematica descriptions were useful with the exercises beneficial."
1,"Expensive book, even more expensive software","Just wanted to echo the other reviews and point out that you'll be out $200+ (for academics/students) to get a working version of the software. The book is not very useful without the software, unless you have not been using Mathematica for many years and are still on version 4. I'm highly disappointed, as I am now out the cost of the book, and can't do anything unless I spend $130 more."
2,Spend another $89 for working software,The book looks very good but only if you have over $150 to spend. The book covers Mathematica and using an add on package designed for Mathematica 4. The software included with the book does not work with Mathematica 5 and they want an additional $89 for the version 5 update. If you want to see for yourself the site with deetails on the software is here:http://www.mathstatica.com/
1,Please check compatibility with Mathematica 5.0,At the present time (Dec 2003) this software is not compatible with Mathematica 5.0 (check the mathstatica website) and the trial verison of Mathematica which comes with the book expires after 30 days.
5,A BERNSTEIN MUST !!!!!,"I have owned this recording for some time , but really enjoy giving it as a gift to those who are not aware of the work. It conveys all passion and zeal of a live performance. Only the composer , often with tongue in cheek, could extract this performance from the soloist and orchestra. you can literally feel ""Lennie"" dancing on the podium and mouthing the lyrics..and who else but bernstein could capture Ludwig,Hadley and Anderson to create the stellar cast.. this recording alone should create interest in a possible broadway revival"
4,Excellent Recording,Another recording that you should know what you are getting. I bought it as a gift upon request & it is not my type of musical but the recording is done very well. JJ
3,If only... this isn't the recording for me,"I find the operatic voices grating and the overall effect somewhat lacking, where there should be words all there is is tremolo. My appreciation of this piece is colored by my first exposure to the excellent San Francisco Symphony and Chorus production of 2002 or so. I find Candide and the Governor particularly disappointing. In the SF Symphony performance the finale was a superbly powerful and full bodied affair, if they had been allowed to record it I wouldn't be writing this review now, by contrast the finale on this production is spoiled by the excessive tremolo. As I listen while I write this I've had to take my headphones off so I can remember the way I have heard this instead of how it's performed here.This is not the production for me."
4,Easy-to-Build Electronic Projects for Model Railroaders,"This is a good primer for electronics in general. The book explains basic electronic parts and their functions. Not much effort is given to schematics because all circuits are drawn as finished assemblies. Concepts on improving locomotive performance are also explained and will give modelers plenty to think about. Improving throttles and switch machines also explained. Other projects like operating signals, walkaround throttles, train detection and sound are given in easy to understand formats. DCC is also covered, although in 1988, DCC was somewhat primitive at the time so only so much could have been written. I recommend this book to any model railroader who wants to add realism to his layout using electronics but does not know how to get started."
1,Bad news,I heard how great this pan was but everything I cooked stuck to the bottom and it was very heavy. Tossed it.
1,Montessori-lite,"The author brings too much of her own beliefs to the text which seems to stray somewhat from doctrinaire Montessori e.g. on page 6 the designation of a chapel as part of the Montessori environment. The bibliography consists of six texts, all written by Montessori herself, with no reference to other current texts. The illustrations and content seem amateurish compared to other (cheaper) texts available. The focus of the book is more on home schooling with a Montessori flavour. Try Gettman's ""Basic Montessori"" or Hainstock's ""Teaching Montessori in the Home""."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"After eagerly looking forward to reading Montessori at Home for the Preschooler, I was somewhat disappointed. Although this book has some good ideas about teaching your child, the vast majority of it is all things that any of us do with our child on any given day. I will use this as a reference book, however I think parents need to remember that they know their child and his/her learning style best. Any child with a dedicated parent and loving support will flourish."
3,Aqua Tongs,I love these tongs and have been using it for the past year...but...it makes such a mess with the water getting inside the tong and coming out of the handle. I always get wet so does the floor. You can't lay it flat until you make sure all the water has drained. It's a pain when you have 3 shy engeneer gobies to feed. It's helpful when moving rocks but messy and not always it grabs well. I am looking for a new tong.
3,BenDover,These work very well. I would like them to be ten or fifteen inches longer so that I could grab items on the floor without bending over. Good for the aquarium only.
1,surprise inside jewel case,"contains repair cloth, .30 oz repair solution ( fully dried like a paint blister scraping )packet,1 jewel case. failed on solution recieved as a dry product."
1,No repair fluid,The fluid that was supposed to fix the CD came in a hard block all dried out. My guess is that someone got their hands on some cases of really old product and decided to sell them.
1,faulty product,"Dirctions were to massage the solution in the package. No amount of massaging would turn the hard dry paste into a solution. One package was totally dried out, the other mostly dry. I did apply some of the softest product on the disc and rubbed as directed, but there was no visible or audible improvement. This was a total waste of time and money. I did not return because of the low cost. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,This is crap!,"Did not do what it says it does. Only thing this does is remove large scratches. No matter how many times you put this stuff on the small scratches are still. Plus it leaves crusty white stuff on the disc and smears. Not sure if discs are better before or after the application of this stuff. I guess you get what you pay for. Wait no you don't. All I got was a jewel case, two pads, and two tiny packets of solution. What a rip off. Didn't even get a manual. What kind of advertisement is this? I know, the black market kind."
3,Not so good,"I agree with terranpatriot, the kit only contains two pads and two packs of a white toothpaste like solution. And the one left unopened solidified after a while. It was useful to repair a couple of CDs though."
1,rip off,"I decided to believe the five-star reviewers. Maybe they got a different product. I ordered mine from one of the cheapest Amazon merchants. The paste I got with this (Allsop #25717) is so unabrasive that it apparently did nothing to my scratched disc. I think the above photo lists the contents correctly except that I got ""2 repair cloth"" (sic) instead of one with the .30 oz repair solution and one jewel case. That's all. Amazon's detailed description of what's included must be for a different product. Allsop says their other Scratch Repair System #58200 ""provides up to 100 repairs."" I'd be happy for one repair, but this doesn't do it. I've read that some swear by Brasso metal polish. I'll try it next."
1,It's everything you expect,"If you EXPECT that cd repair kits don't work, and are a waste of money, you won't be disappointed."
2,CD Scratch Remover,"Every CD that I used it on, it didn't seem to help. They still wouldn't read on my cd player or computer. The little packets of cleaner were a pain. I got the stuff all over the place. They only give you two littlecleaning towelettes. Very disappointing. Not worth even the small price that I paid for it."
4,One small problem,Product was delivered on time. It works very well and gives you extended battery power. The only problem I had and it's a small one is that the instructions relating to the removal of the battery door was very vague. I had to go on line to find out the proper procedure to remove the door. If it wasn't for that I would have rated it 5 stars
5,Great Battery Pack,"My old battery pack broke and I needed a replacement. I have learned long ago that having two batteries available for the D80 is a necessity for me. This battery pack is as good as new, and does the job I require of my D80!"
3,Might be great for the D80,"It adds a nice pleasant heft to my D90, but on several occasions I would get the ""no battery"" icon and would have to wiggle the unit to restore contact. I've read about people shoving cardboard into one side of the unit to create a tighter fit to eliminate this, but you shouldn't have to do that to make something work properly.It was designed for the D80, and that's where it should be used, I think."
2,S0-S0,Door lock broke after about 4 months. Drains your batteries. I would just go with the Nikon brand. Tried to save a little money and now I have to buy a new one any way. Form and fit is not too good either.
5,"Yeah, baby...","Fit, finish and function are all first rate. I noted that even with steep savings in the purchase price, some of the after market mfgs had reviews noting 'slight' cosmetic issues, or not being exactly what was expected. Yep, it cost a little more than the after market offerings, but no surprises.... priceless."
5,Great product,I just received my MB D80 battery grip this morning. It was easy to install on my D90. My camera looks great! I have taken several shots with the shutter release button on the grip and focusing is not a problem. The command and sub command dials work flawlessly. The grip feels great. Taking portraits just got simpler. I barely notice a change in weight by adding the battery pack to my camera. I am pleased with this product.
4,MAKES AN ALREADY GREAT CAMERA EVEN BETTER,"The Nikon MB-D80 Multi-Power Pack-Grip for my Nikon D80 Digital SLR camera adds to the already great feel of the D80. The added ability of being able to turn the camera sideways to shoot (portrait style) and have the release button is fantastic. It also adds to the profile of the camera making it look like my old film Nikon F-5 (which I don't miss anymore). I have had many an 'eye and head' turned since getting this grip.The ability to shoot hundreds of photos and not worry about running out of power is wonderful. Took a four day motor trip shooting pictures all the way and still had plenty of power left. I highly recomend this grip to any Nikon D-80 owner. Saw some comments about it looking plastic or cheap and I disagree as it looks and feels just great, matching the finish of my D80 perfectly. AAAA+ Is my personal rating. TJ"
4,Good but not Great,"Does what it says on the Tin. However,1. Like *All* Nikon accessories tt is too expensive for what is delivered (the remote control is unbelivable - cost to make 20 cents, sold for? $28!!2. The button has a totally different feel to the Camera button - this is a significant fail - I bought a Nikon grip to get a Nikon standard. It might seem minor but having a totally different feel on the two buttons is disconcerting....3. Pity it could not perform additional functions (For the size) such as a slot in charger, GPS unit or Wifi. The GP-1 is a totally flawed product, and being able to slot in extra features into the Grip would make it a much more useful product.Don't understand people buying it saying its bulky etc? I mean, don't they read the spec?"
3,Nikon D80/90 battery grip,Adds a good deal of bulk but does what you buy one of these for (added battery life). Also provides another shutter release and more area for gripping which are nice at times. I usually have this in the bag and pull it out when I know I will be taking a lot of shots. Some folks may just be better off buying an extra battery and carrying that around if they are at all worried about the bulk.
3,Little too big,"I have the MB-16 for my N80. This unit feels much larger than the MB-16...almost too big. The second battery is nice, as is the second shutter release. I still bought this unit knowing the shutter release is too sensitive (from Amazon reviews). You can turn off the shutter release so its not really that annoying.I am not sure if I would buy this again since I almost feel arthritic after using the grip. They just made it a little too big."
5,So excited to have this,I finally got this and am so glad! No more having to stop and change my battery in the middle of an important shoot. I have a nikon D90 it fits perfectly and was easy to install. I shoot alot of portraits so the extra grip when held at this angle helps me to steady the camera. I'm glad I went with the Nikon name I know I have a quality product.
4,Excellent Product,"Nikon MB-D80 Battery Pack is solid, stable and hold 2 Lithium batteries or a slew of AA batteries.There is a ring that needs to be turned to tighten the battery pack to the camera. Every once and a while that ring needs to be tighten to ensure it stays attached to the camera. It doesn't happen enough to be annoying, but could be an issue if you forget to do it when you pick your camera up and have a very expensive lens on. Although, I haven't had an issue like that yet.The batteries hold tight and the battery life is outstanding. Once tightened, the grip is sturdy and appears to be well built. I would prefer some grip on the back on the battery door and the shutter button isn't as nice as the shutter button the camera but it works fine.I think this grip is excellent and have no major issues with it."
4,What you pay for,"You only need this battery pack if you are taking weddings or traveling in areas where recharging will be difficult. It gives you the extra battery life you need and allows you the option of using either the rechargeable batteries or a pack of AA's. The bottom line is, this give you flexibility. Plus, it's not very bulky and is well thought out regarding buttons and grip."
4,A must have,"I have two D80's and only had this grip for one of them for a while...and found myself never using the body that was without the grip. So I finally broke down and got the grip for the second body.Not only is this a must have for stability while taking pictures, but the verticle shutter release is something I don't know how you could go without.The battery options are also nice, with having the ability to use two batteries for extended picture taking, as well as the ability to use AA batteries if you need to.The only reason I didn't give this item 5 stars is due to the price.In summary; would I buy one again...I already have!"
5,Nikon MB- D80 Power Pack for the Nikon D90 Digital Camera,"Great, Used it a lot, but a little heavy. To be expected with multi batteries."
2,Only works in certain position,"The grip attached easily and securely, however it would not link to the camera when all the way screwed in. I had to loosen the screw for it to connect properly and power the camera. It didn't feel secure after that and would still lose the connection periodically. I was also expecting it to made out of the same durable plastic and grip that the camera is made out of, but this felt cheaper. I returned it."
3,Not good for landscape,"I bought this grip thinking it would improve my Nikon D90 for vertical portrait shots. It does that. What it also does is make horizontal landscape shots very awkward. The new bump on the bottom gives your left hand no place to rest on the camera body and still have access to the zoom ring on the lens with your fingers. It also makes the camera very heavy. As for battery life, it is simply easier to carry a spare battery separately. There is nothing wrong with the build or design of the MB-D80. But beside the ability to power the camera with AA cells, it just doesn't add much of anything to the utility of the camera. I sent mine back for a refund."
3,Not up to Nikon standards,"Well, it's useful. But it's certainly not up to Nikon standards.First off, it feels cheap compared to the D80 body.Second, the shutter release button is missing any sort of tactile indication at the pre-focus level.Third, the ""lock"" switch is opposite in functionality to the on-off switch... counterclockwise to enable grip controls, whereas the on-off is clockwise to turn on camera.It does, however handle two batteries, and provide a vertical grip. It's just too bad Nikon couldn't keep it at the same standards level as the actual camera it's paired with."
2,hope you like wet sand,"My husband brought this sandbox for our 20 month old daughter. She was so excited when he put it together and filled it with sand. She played in it every day untill it rained. Since the base has groove where the lid is suppose to fit, sand fills in that area and if you do not clean it out every time your child is in it the lid will not fit right and after it rains you now have wet smelly sand. So now you have to keep your child away from the sandbox untill the sand dries. I love the idea of this sandbox, but after you purchase it get the umbrella (which is not included) fill it with the endless bags of sand. It is not worth the price tage for something my daughter can't use untill the sand dries which can take a month."
1,Great when not raining,I thought this was the cutest sandbox. Great concept of a sandbox and picnic table combo. My son loves it.I loved it to till it rained. Now I have wet sand. The lid does not fit right. It will keep animals out of it but not the rain. If the company makes the lid larger it would be great. Until then I don't recommend it.
5,Pleased Mom of Two!,"This sandbox is GREAT! I have a four-year-old and a two-year-old, and they both have fun with this nearly every day for hours. I let them bring out some of their favorite things into the sandbox -- cars, dinosaurs, digging toys, and plastic bugs --- and they come up with so many imaginary stories and games. My oldest took her tea set into the sandbox to play restaurant with the table. Someone mentioned that the umbrella blew away quite a bit; we have had some very windy days, but it hasn't blown away -- it seems like they may have improved the fit of the umbrella into the table part because it fits rather 'tight.' The lid has also been doing a great job at keeping out the rain. I notice there are four holes made for bungee cords to keep the lid down tighter if you want.Overall, this is the best sandbox I have ever seen, and I am well pleased."
3,"Good in theory, but not as dual-purpose as we had hoped.","We bought this hoping we could use it as both a sandbox and a place for our toddler to sit and eat his lunch while outside. It works great as a sandbox--the umbrella is especially nice. But the proximity of the table and benches to the sandbox make it impractical for us to use it for lunchtime. You see, the table is a great place, in his opinion, to pour sand all over, draw shapes in it, line up sand-filled buckets, pour small hills, etc. And the faux-wood finish on the plastic table and bench make it really hard to clean off the sand very easily. So, if you want this set so that you don't have to buy a sandbox AND kiddie picnic table, this is probably not the set for you. You are better off buying a regular sandbox and separate picnic table."
4,Great sandbox,"We've had this sandbox/picnic table for 2 years now, and my 2 year old son loves it. Reasons why I like it:- Plenty big for 2- It's really really cute- Not obnoxious colors. Looks good in our yard.- Our lid stays on, and it's never leaked or blown off.- Umbrella fits under sand box lidThings to consider:Obviously, you're paying extra $$ for the attached picnic table. It's really really cute, but my 2 year olds have never actually sat at it for more than 30 seconds, even to eat, because the sand box is too tempting. And if they were to eat at it, usually it has sand all over it.This gripe would be about any sandbox and 2 year olds. They love to play in sand, but they get covered with sand - in their clothes, hair, ears... I know boys are made to get dirty, but it's hard getting them from the yard to the tub without getting sand all over the house! But they love it, and that's what matters!!!"
2,Pretty good if you like wet sand!,I thought it was the cutest thing. My two girls played in it and had a ball! The next day it rained and they haven't played in it since. It doesn't dry out and it keeps getting wet when it rains. I think the top doesn't fit good.
5,Step 2 Sand Box,"I highly recommend this item.... My daughter just loves her new sandbox. While I find the lid that is used to cover the sandbox is on the flimsy side, I have not had any problems with it. The sandbox has good curb appeal and does not stand out like an eye soar in the yard. This item has provided many hours of fun playtime for my daughter. This item is very easily assembled, I put it together in approx. 10 min or less. The attached table is also a great added feature. My daughter loves to sit up at the table when she wants to take a break."
1,did not receive the item,i am a little annoyed. my sandbox has not been delievered yet and i have not seen number to contact the person shipping the item. it has been shipping soon since 8-16-2005. i gave one star because there is no opption for 0.
1,Really Disappointed,"I agree that cold calling is out and referral selling yields higher sales volume. I am already practicing this in my business and record about 1 million in sales annually (2nd in my organization) doing this. I wanted to increase my performance so I bought this book.I was dumbfounded. I am only 1/2 way through it and all I hear about is why referral selling is great and how the author succeeded in it. Great, but when does the author start sharing????Normally, I can plow through business books as they really hold my interest. However, this one I cannot read through quickly because the 1st 1/2 is sooooo repitive and to be honest I am tired of hearing the author pat herself on the back.To be fair, keep in mind I only read 1/2 thus far. But, I am NOT happy with my purchase....."
2,"One Real Character, 15 Stereotypes","My biggest problem with Goodman's book was not the fact that she tells a very low-key story (e.g. not much action) but that she has created one real, fully developed character - Elizabeth Schulman- and stuck her in a novel populated by walking stereotypes. None of the other characters is fully fleshed out. So I could never quite care about them. The structure would allow for this, if Goodman wanted, because an omniscent narrator describes the action - it is not told strictly from Elizabeth's point-of-view. The local judge was the most egregious stereotype - he was straight from a bad sitcom.The book's popularity does not surprise me. Any book about a community that seems exotic to the mainstream limosine liberal media establishment is pounced upon for its ""authenticity."" Goodman is a talented writer, I just wish someone had made her work a little harder on this book."
2,This book was similiar to watching it rain.,"I wanted so much to love this book. It starts out beautifully describing a people, a lifestyle and a part of the country that all deserve the intricate detail that Mrs. Goodman uses to paint their picture. The problem is that after the picture is painted, it just stops. No story, no emotion, nothing. You so want the characters to interact and they simply brush against each other on occassion: even husband and wife, brother and brother. Several of the characters introduced actually dropped out of the story without an explination. I hoped until the last page that this book would ""wake up."" It was sort of like watching it rain. The author has mastered description, her next work should add a little story to the words."
1,GIVE ME A BREAK,"I HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE GOOD. BUT HYPE RULES THE DAY WITH NO REGARD TO TRUE QUALITY. ONE PERSON SAYS ITS GOOD SO EVERYONE DOES. KAATERSKILL FALLS IS NOT TERRIBLE, THAT'S TRUE, BUT IT'S BORING AND IT SEEMS LIKE GOODMAN IS CONSTANTLY SCREAMING OUT LOOK AT ME, LOOK HOW I CAN WRITE: I CAN BE FUNNY. AND I CAN BE SMART. THE NARRATIVE LINES DONT HOLD TOGETHER AND ONE OF THEM, ABOUT THE REAL ESTATE OF THE AREA, SHOULD HAVE BEEN EDITED OUT ON AN EARLY DRAFT."
2,kaaterskill falls,"after all the raves i heard about this book, i daresay i was abjectly disappointed. nobody had any real character; it was mainly as if everybody was described but not explored. i sincerely kept waiting for the action to erupt but everything just dribbled. a big yawn."
2,"Well written, but a depressing view of a woman's life","This is an extremely well written book. But..I wanted to quit reading it...I could see that unless our heroine empowered herself, she would be stuck with the decisions of a strict religious society, where men make decisions for how women live, what they can and cannot do in their life and by the way, in what is also her world. This was a depressing book. It does not agree with my philosophy of life..to take advantage of opportunities where you can, and to live as freely and decisively as men do in their world, while still cherishing loving family, community and faith. I did finish reading it out of curiosity. The feelings raised in me, by this book are age old for women. Ones that I wish women of today do not have to face. I don't like reading about women who make depressing choices for themselves."
1,Just couldn't see the point,"I rarely leave a book unfinished, but that is exactly what I did with Kaaterskill Falls. I got fed up one night, and tossed it into the recycle bin!I usually like ""slice of life"" stories, I can handle chararcters that maybe aren't entirely fleshed out and I don't necessarily need books to have a strong storyline, but man oh man, this book was painful.Maybe it's because I am not Jewish and some of the author's references went over my head. I'm sure there are others who will love this book, but don't feel bad if you aren't one of them."
4,Kaaterskill Falls a novel on Cassettes,While I didn't enjoy the book that much the service and product received itself was punctual and in good condition.
2,Felt No Emotion Regarding These Characters,"I read this book for a book club that I just joined, and although some in the club really liked it, and used words like ""loved"" and ""hated"" to describe their emotions regarding Goodman's characters, I just never felt much toward them. Like others reviewing here, I kept waiting for the big drama to explode -- it never did. I found the book slow and tedious, but perhaps that is how Goodman wanted us to perceive life in this strict Orthodox Jewish community -- plodding and predictable. I finished it, but was a chore."
2,I Kept Waiting and Waiting for Something to Happen,"I enjoyed getting to know the characters of this book and felt the author developed them well, but once they were created in my mind I felt like they just stood there and didn't take any action. After the first hundred pages or so, I knew everything I needed to know about Goodman's community and kept expecting something interesting to happen. I keep hearing this book compared to a newer one, The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis, and, like the previous reviewer, I feel The Ladies Auxiliary is a much better story with more lyrical and beautiful writing. It is exciting to see the blossoming of so much literary fiction about Orthodox Jews."
1,No plot and lifeless characters - a real snorer.,"Kaaterskill Falls is about as interesting as a still life painting. It caught my attention for the first 50 pages, but 329 pages of observations of small town life, even if it is within the Orthodox Jewish community, could not hold my attention. The characters never took control of their lives. Life acts on these people, they do not act upon life. I kept waiting for someone to develop a backbone and take charge but it unfortunately never happened.In the end, I was just happy to be rid of these annoying peole and leave them to their own dreary lives. Give me fiction written before the 1960's. Good or bad, those characters have substance. I give Kaaterskill Falls a hearty thumbs down."
1,Terrible - don't waste your time,This book was a waste of my life. I was forced to read it becuase of my englih class and I hated every second of it. Nothing interesting happened. It just seemed to go on and on with it's rambling and never end.
4,An interesting journey into a different world,"This books succeeds on a number of levels. It vividly portrays life in a very conservative Jewish sect. The many characters in this novel deal with the restrictions imposed by the religious leaders in their own individual ways - some challenging, some subversive, some submissive.Within this context the reader will find the classic themes of parent/child conflicts, marital problems, the joys and constrictions of community life.The author wisely does not give us tidy endings, leaving some loose ends, just as life does. But what I went away with was an idea of the direction in which the characters were going and how they had changed and (most of them) grown in the two years covered by the book. This is a good and satisfying read."
2,"Give us some passion next time, Allegra!","I picked up this book because I am interested in Jewish American literature and I liked the premise of the book -- the life inside a small, somwhat cloistered community. What I found though to be the overarching problem with this book is that Goodman looks at this world from such a distance that the story is ultimately unengaging. Other readers have complained that it's boring or that there's no plot -- I know what they're referring to, but I think it's not so much the lack of plot that makes it a boring read as it is the fact that there's so little passion here. Even the writing is so unwaveringly precise that instead of being a virtue of the book, it becomes a flaw, rendering the book dainty instead of daring. I came away from this book wishing that something, anything, might shake Goodman up a bit, that next time we might see some flash of real emotion, some hint of unrestrained raw energy."
4,Tension between personal development and a tight-knit community,"This is a tight, sociological and psychological novel about a community of Orthodox Jews; although she follows many intersecting characters, this is primarily the story of a young, married woman with five children who wants to express her personality apart from being a homemaker while staying within the community. The theme is reflected in the development of some of the children. It's moving and it moves!"
3,"pretty writing, educational, but went nowhere","Imagine how good this book would have been if it actually had a plot. The prose style was wonderful and the author is an excellent writer. It also educated me into the world of a certain kind of Orthodox Judaism and, for this, it has great value. But other than that, it was a slow moving, tedious slice of life with no great themes or even a real story. It was not a page turner or one where you just want to keep reading on to find out what happens. Because nothing much happens. The author was not a good old fashioned storyteller for the purposes of this book. But she is such a good prose stylist with an eye for detail that if, in the future, she decides to include a plot, then I think she has extraordinary potential."
3,An Interesting Book,"I liked this book, I guess, but couldn't get too excited about it. There are some nice parts to it, but I have to say, it did get a little boring. I recently read two other books about Jewish life - The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis and For the Relief of Unbearable urges by Nathan Englander and thought these were far more fun and enjoyable!"
4,A modest portrait of a microcosmic orthodox Jewish community,"Goodman's portrait of this Kirshner community of religious Jews who summer together in the countryside of upper state New York is both sympathetically respectful and sharply observant. It is about being Jewish in a non-Jewish world, about being bone-deep religious in a world where religiosity is not common, about submitting oneself to the dictates of community rules in a society that prides itself on the oppposite. Yet the two contrasting sons of the Rev Kirshner's family seem not unfamiliar, the plight of Elizabeth pulled between the growing sense of her subculture's strictures and the larger but frightening possibilities outside that, the chasm betw3een the older man tied to his sisters and his young wife Nina - these seem part of a microcosm of any world, however small, however specifically different. It does tend to be episodic; it is limited in the range of its displayed emotions. but it is a lovely book."
4,"What a Subtle, Wonderful Read","There may not be a lot of action, nor is there much humor, but the author's prose and pace is both lyrical and seductive. No doubt Meryl Streep is warming up her New York Jewish accent right now to play the lead character. There is much majesty in this work, which chronicles a life that few of us (including me) could never understand, yet exists for this family of insular, intensely religious people."
3,Fascinating slice of life about an Orthodox Jewish community,"I found this book beautifully, almost poetically written. It brought to mind the style of Jane Urquehart (""Away""). It evoked the peace and beauty of an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle...the feeling of family, spirituality and sense of purpose. At the same time, the story pitted this image against a more contemporary lifestyle, leading the reader to ponder the merits of each. At one point, a woman member of the community experiences an awakening of her own needs and these needs conflict with the wishes of the presiding Rabbi. The way she deals with this conflict, which affects her family and friends, and changes her view of herself in the community, is most informative and thought provoking. I am recommending this book for my Book Club."
3,"Enjoyable, folksy music.","I purchased this album in Germany in l983 and continue to enjoy it today. Is it a great work of art? Probably not, but Nicole has a soothing voice and I find this album relaxing. As for the reviewer who states that ""a little peace"" is a rediculous idea I believe a little peace is just what we need, a remake of this song would be timely."
4,Great album,"The music itself is great. Spor and Evol Intent... If you like that kind of stuff, it's awesome. The 2 second gap between songs is a bit annoying. Kind of breaks up the flow of the album. And with some songs being rather short in the mix, the gap makes it a little distracting. Music, 5 stars."
3,"A Look Into The Private Interiors of Celebrities, Part One","Although the quality of design varies with the homes of the thirty celebrity subjects, this is an interesting time-capsule look. Some interiors stand up better to the scrutiny of today's standards of designs than others, but all have an element of interest. See my review shown with another listing of this same edition."
1,INADEQUATE!,2005 Mustang: NOPE!1998 Civic: NOPE!2006 MDX: NOPE!Quality: High.Vehicle coverage: POOR!Recommendation: PURCHASE ONLY the UNIVERSAL ADAPTER!I own & operate an automotive repair facility. I'm always left using the universal adapter. I paid top dollar for mediocre vehicle coverage. This master kit IS a WASTE of MONEY.
5,Just what we needed!!!,"We bought this set and got it a few days ago.. we have only done 4 brake flushes with it and our new pressure brake bleeder and it works great. comes with a nice little chart that tells you what adapter fits what vehicles.. although not all vehicle are on the chart so a little guess work is in order.. for example, to find the correct adapter to fit an 2009 Dodge Ram 1500, you must look through the Chrysler adapters and narrow your choice down to 2 most common Chrysler adapters and test fit them on the vehicle. Dodge Ram isn't even listed on the chart. Still, a little common sense will go a log way. it also has little stickers on the adapters with the adapter number labeled on them.. i can see these little stickers coming off over a period of time. Thank goodness the adapters are color coded to the chart.. just dont loose the chart. HA!!"
2,If I could find a better pouch I would,"I would not buy this again. The edge of the pouch impinges on the earphones connection and already wore out I set of earphones. The attachment to a belt is tricky to use, cant be done one handed and frequently unlatches when I am moving around. I am in the market for a better one."
3,Overall Review,"The last saga of the Dragonball GT series seems to be more thought out than the rest of the anime. Out of Dragonball, Dragonball Z, and Dragonball GT, DBZ was my favorite out of all of them. Dragonball Z is a power trip, but more thought out. Dragonball GT seemed rushed and not as good of a storyline. The ending of the Dragonball GT series has an ok ending. I can not say it had a good ending, because through my eyes, it seemed a little bit easy to beat the ultimate Omega Shenron."
5,"My son is a Dragon Ball Gt Fan, He loves it!","My son (10yrs old) wanted this for Christmas. We bought this just before Christmas yet it got here in time to be under the tree for him. He loves it! We bought it used, perfect condition, plays well. He has the whole series now. 1 to 15, thanks."
5,Pretty awesome!,Alot of people don't like the gt series i think its actually good just because akira toriyama didn't work on this one its still his work!!
4,DBGT isn't all that bad.,"ok, so here is the deal, DBGT i thought was really good, untill the end, it started to weaken, and weaken. now, i recomend whatching the 6-10 boxset becasue i really thought those episodes were a lot more fun than these, but i hate to say it, but i liked these episodes, yes, at times they were VERY boring, but it's the end of the Dragonball Trilogy!Now this boxset goes through Goku, Pan, and Trunks fighting off monsters made by wishes on the Normal Orange Star Dragonballs from the earlier show Dragon Ball Z! like there is a monster that is made off of the underwear wish! that made me laugh a little! and the opponents get harder and harder! untill Goku is in a strange position.so anyways, i own the who series, i bought each DVD indivisually when they came out. so i wasted over 400$. i was going to sell them, but thinking about it, maybe i wont."
5,Finally!,"I have waited a long time for these to be released on DVD. These are great family movies at a good price. If you have never seen these movies before, you are in for a treat. Highly recommended. I wish that they would release the next volume soon.This volume does NOT include:1. A Family Affair (1937)2. Judge Hardy's Children (1938)3. Love Finds Andy Hardy4. The Hardys Ride High (1939)5. Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever (1939)6. The Courtship of Andy Hardy (1942)7. Andy Hardy's Double Life (1942)8. Andy Hardy's Blonde Trouble (1944)9. Love Laughs at Andy Hardy (1946)10. Andy Hardy Comes Home (1958)Update:Still no volume 2 as of 1/24/2013, but some ARE available on Amazon Instant Video. I wish volume 2 would come out!"
5,"Ah, these really take you back.",What a simple happy world Andy Hardy lived in and the stories remind me of the family ones on TV in the fifties. Delightful and filled with life lessons even for today. We were pleased to see our grandkids have enjoyed them.
3,Warner Archive Collection including The Andy Hardy Collection:Vol 1,"These are from the Warner Archive Collection; the discs are made on demand and do not contain special features that would be rich in this collection. I grew up with the movies in the Warner Archive Collection which makes me old; when you are old your ears don't work well. The Warner Archive Collection does not have subtitles; it reduces their value to someone with ears like mine and something you should be aware of before purchase. I am old and can't wait for them to come out on Blu-Ray, so will watch with earphones, but I can't give the discs better than three stars."
5,A must have for Andy Hardy movie fans.,This set is a must have for Andy Hardy movie fans. I can't wait for Volume 2 to come out. A quality DVD product that is well worth the price.
2,"For the price, don't expect too much","This laptop gets real hot, though that is a testament to AMD Athlon chips which notoriously consume more power than Pentium chips. Since the CPU is always running so hot, it always sets off the fan, which seems to go off every 2-3 minutes with light web browsing, and is almost constantly on when doing anything more intensive. The schizophrenic nature of the fan is noticeable and somewhat loud compared to sound level of any Pentium notebook I have ever heard.Also, the hinge design is very poor. I have had laptops in the past with similar hinge covers that broke off after about 12 months of use- why can't these guys just make metal hinge covers like IBM???For more information, do a google on the ""unofficial Averatec support forums"" on the web, and read for yourself...Pros: Dirt cheap Cons: Gets real hot, fan makes more noise than most notebooks, shared video memory, poor hinge design."
1,Avoid Averatec,"I bought an Averatec 3150H notebook in January. The first one had defective battery and I returned it. The replacement had problems with screen, I sent it in for repairs and it's now been in their repair shop for over two months waiting for parts. Averatec product quality is inferior and their service is non-existent. Don't waste your money on this brand."
1,Royally Dead...,"My family and I anticipated the conclusion of this series. Even though the previous book was a disappointment, there was still hope! Let me tell you that the first 36 pages of the book killed that hope right quick! Only one out of the three readers in this house made it to the end of the book (and she cheats!). I agree with all the previous reviews although I believe that some were too nice. The book left me with two burning questions: 1. It's obvious the author didn't read any of the previous books, but isn't there anyone who has oversight over the entire series?(I say let's line 'em all up!) 2. What's the best way to get this book out of my house? I find it almost impossible to throw a book into the trash, but, in this case, it would be morally reprehensible to perpetuate it on the used book shelves. BEWARE! (And by the way, that one star wasn't my idea.)"
2,Sadly disappointed.,"My expectations were set high by the prior books in the series. Unfortunately, this book did not meet my expectations. Too many details were left outstanding. Why bring the infant into the story? Why no discussion of the affect of his prior occupation? Although we know that he moves back to the kingdom, does he assume his title or will it pass to his son? This book needed closure!"
1,Simply wretched!,"This was the second book I've ever read of this author and it will be the last! The other books where so good. This one was a major let down. To sum up my feelings on this book, it's rather like eating all these wonderful desserts one right behind the other. Then realizing you've eaten way to much, and tossing your cookies as a result. The only thing you're left with, is a bad taste in your mouth!"
1,does not fi,"I purchased this belt for my 2006 GMC Envoy. When I tried to install it there was no way it would fit over an around all the pulleys and idlers. It seemed to be 2"" too short - the auto tensioner was fully backed off.The numbers on the packaging sleeve indicated the correct belt and he belt appeared to be a high quality product, but it was too short. There were no numbers on the belt itself that would confirm that it was the correct fit, so I suspect it was packaged incorrectly."
5,A Must Have,"Loved this book, such a good read with great characters amd a tragic yet honest plot. I could read this book a hundred times over."
5,"Good, sturdy, nice for the price","I really like this lockbox. It's sturdy, metal-lined in all the right places, and just the right size to hold all my files for one worksite. It'll hold six inches' worth of file folders. The locks seem sturdy as well and were easy to set. I hadn't thought about it in advance, but there are probably lock mechanisms that would allow faster access; it takes a while to turn all six dials to the appropriate numbers. But I like that the lock is self-contained and there is no key to lose. My favorite part of the box is the handle; it has just the right curve and is very comfy in my hand. And the box is relatively lightweight for being reinforced, so it's not too hard to carry my files back and forth. If I was carrying a heavier load I would want it in backpack form. All in all, I'm happy with this purchase for the money."
2,Pretty but Defective!!,"Very disappointed. This lock box looks so nice and seems durable yet light, but when I set the combos to both sides, only one would open!!Unfortunately, I trusted that the directions would allow me to set the combination and I'd be able to get back into the box. Wrong! So now my files are stuck inside.I will call Vaultz and see if they can be of any help. Otherwise, I'll just break into it, which doesn't seem like it'd be too hard. I wish there were more comprehensive directions from Vaultz. It seems several people have had this problem."
5,Perfect and portable,"This is a great little box, and easy to set the codes. No need to worry about losing a key, so it works great for our group where multiple people may need access. Holds a lot of files/papers, and is very easy to tote around as needed. I am very happy with this purchase."
2,Kind of flimsey and came damaged,"It looks nice, but this thing isn't very well made - cheesy connections at the corners. It came damaged as well - not surprising since it doesn't seem to have very sturdy connections or materials. I guess you get what you pay for - if it was twice the price I would be very disappointed... at this price, just slightly."
4,Good storage,"My grandson wanted a place to put his things so his younger brother could not get them, so I got this as a present. It is sturdy and locks and he is quite happy with it. Good size."
1,Ideastream Vaultz Locking Personal File,"This was a bad purchase for the simple fact that it has a combination lock type locking device. I set a 3 digit pin and had all my important papers inside and when I went to try to open it, it didn't open. I was flabbergasted because I couldn't get to all my important papers. After trying to open this with several different numbers, I finally found the 3 digit pin that worked to open it, but it still sometimes doesn't open.Don't buy this product, you'll be sorry. I use it unlocked for now until I purchase something else."
1,Defective Product,"The Vaultz Locking Personal File that I bought from Amazon is defective. I cannot set the combination. The same file that I bought elsewhere previously, however, is fine. Lesson learned."
2,Great Lakes Wildlife,"This is not a BOOK but a fold over, laminated pamplet. Contains a page on invertebrates pictures, 2 pages on fishes, 1 page on reptiles and amphibians, 3 on birds and 3 on mammals. The scientific name and the size of the animal is all the information that is listed. I was expecting some descripton that would help distinguish an organism from other similar ones. I was surprised that neither the carp nor the alewife was included."
1,wrong picture!!!,The wrong ribbon is posted with this ribbon. This is actually an orange ribbon with blue dots NOT the rainbow ribbon pictured. I ordered expecting what is pictured and had a deadline to meet and it messed everything up. We aware that you are not ordering what is pictured here!!!!
4,"A satisfying, unified and sophisticated album.","This 1991 release was one of Luther's most commercially sucessful projects. Though not released as singles , the two best songs were ""I Want The Night To Stay"" and ""I'm Gonna Start Today"". Vocally, Luther's at his best on the two above-mentioned songs and ""The Rush"", ""Sometimes It's Only Love"" and ""She Does'nt Mind"". Avoid the new-jack-swing flavored dance tracks ""Emotional Love"" and ""I Can Tell You That"", however."
3,Middle Muddle,"I tried and I tried to connect to this album but couldn't. Truly a mediocre follow up to Quarry. It simply comes across as rushed and phoned in. A sameness throughout, like the vocals were done in one afternoon.The upsides are the title (tops!), the song ""Dear God Please Help Me"", and that it made me reach for Vauxhall and I all over again. Now THAT'S a record!"
3,certainly not the hype it got,"well...there is no doubt that Morrissy's last album ""You Are The Quarry"" is a much better album. Its just too bad that Sanctuary Records didnt do as good of job promoting it like they did with this album. This album is good, but not great. Maybe it was a bit rushed...who knows...but the complexity and diversity of vocals and music is not to the standards that we recieved with ""Your Are The Quarry"". Most of the tracks on ""Ringleader Of The Tormentors"" sound similar in style and sound. I remember hearing the last album over and over when I first got it...but this album I heard twice and didnt care to hear again. Infact, its very difficult to listen all the way through cause you'r bound to get a bit bored half way through.Overall...a 3 1/2 star album...not Morrissey's best, nor his worst. His worst to me will always remain ""Southpaw Grammar""."
4,Morrissey is still the ringleader,"Once again, Morrissey is able to ""turn sickness into popular song"" with this release. I have to admit I didn't like ""Ringleader"" upon first listening to it, but it definitely grew on me. The first two songs ""I Will See You in Far Off Places"" and ""Dear God Please Help Me"" are rather bland, but the album definitely builds from there. I especially liked the eerie children's choir in ""The Youngest Was the Most Loved"" and ""The Father Who Must Be Killed""; very reminiscent of the Smiths song ""Panic."" There are also some very singable melodies on the album, like ""You Have Killed Me"" and ""In the Future When All's Well."" Lyrically, it's not Morrissey's best, but he does do a good job in his usual delving into the darker side of humanity. It may not be ""Viva Hate"" or ""Bona Drag"", but it's definitely worth a listen if you're an avid Morrissey fan like myself."
3,Let Down,"I agree with the people who rated 2 or 3 stars. These songs seem like the bottom of the barrel, just to put out a disc. The combination of Whyte/Morrissey songs have merit, whereas the combination of Tobias/Morrissey songs are hard to listen to. I am a Morrissey freak and have everything from the Smiths and Morrissey collection, so it's nice to have in your collection, but not a good place to start listening to Morrissey. His last disc is hard to pull out of the disc player(You Are The Quarry). I recommend getting that disc with the extra songs. Even his B-sides to Ringleader are easier to listen to. Ala ""Handsome man about town"". I guess Boz Boorer took a break from writing on this one."
2,Well color me dissapointed,"I'm not a very good reviewer, but I know enought to say that I am so dissapointed with this album. I'd been looking forward to buying it for months, and after listening to it once I had no desire to listen to it again. It's boring, it's that simple. I've never been a complete fan of where Morrissey went musically with ""You are the Quarry"", but at least that album drew me in enough that I couldn't stop listening to it for days. I've re-listened to ""Ringleader of the Tormentors"" now a few times, and still it comes out with every song sounding the same. Only the single ""You Have Killed Me"" really seems to stand out, probably because it's a bit more commercial sounding. If you're a die-hard Morrissey fan like me, you probably bought this the day it came out. But to the less fanatic Morrissey fan, I would suggest buying an older album instead, and pretend this one didn't happen."
2,So... Life Is A Pigsty,"Posle odlicnog albuma iz 2004 You Are The Quarry(5/5), album Ringleader Of The Tormentors osim smelog naziva nenudi nista drugo. Pa zasto Morrissey? Ok, svima se manje vise desavaju kiksevi ali dati albumu takav naziv, a snimiti takav tresh tako nesto od Morrissey nije za ocekivanje.Da pogledamo, na albumu je 12 pesama.Od tih pesama samo su dve vredne. Pesma koja otvara ovaj promaseni album I Will See You In Far Off Places i prvi singl You Have Killed Me. Ostatak nije vredan pomena.Jebiga Morrissey, Italija te je totalno sjebala ili si ostario duhom i postao totalno dosadan i hiper kic patetican.Kao iskreni fan, bezi iz Italije dok jos ima nade za tebe."
4,Thsi album is really amazing!,"OK, i gotta be honest, at first i thought this album was boring, and I thought that this would never grow up on me but I kept listening to it, surprisely after 3 or 5 listenings all the songs grew up on me, and if you take the moment to analyze all the sounds, instruments, lyrics you will notice that this is one of the best albums Morrissey has made so far.By the way, I saw the comment of that fan offendended by the ""if the USA bombs you"" line, Come on, if you were really a fan you should know that Moz is known for his black humoristic lyrics.I think you all should give it a try, this is a really good album even if it doesn't seems like it is at first listening!"
3,I blame the production,"Some really great songs here, but just not done very well. The guitars disappear in the mix, all the midrange seems scooped out, and the bass is all sub frequencies...no real body to it.And the vocals...Moz just doesn't sound very strong here. I don't think it's 'age' as some have claimed, just not confident performances. If it is age, It's nothing that some good vocal coaching from a professional couldn't correct. The reverb gives them a disconnected sound as well.Here's hoping the next album will be stronger, and mixed much better, as well as hoping that the vocals are stronger."
4,Moz strikes back,"Not endowed with wide mass political appealing as YOU ARE THE QUARRY,this album is blessed with personal accounts galore instead.It starts off with I'LL SEE YOU...meticulously set against Middle Eastern melodies,leaving you to guess who the song is about....BIN LADEN?.The second track is one of the best as it pictures Moz struggle(I think) with his fleshly desires and sexual inclinations(NO MORE CELIBACY??).The third track,YOU HAVE KILLED ME is intelligently the first single as it enshrinesthe presence of death related verbs/themes(so common in his work)yet accompanied by love and sex..THe rest of the album is very consistent with the artist's releases prior to QUARRY.Yet another romantic tune stands out,WORK OF ART .In it, the use ofwords such as PUKE distances it from the traditional romantic genre.Overall,a great album"
1,Tormented...And Bored to Death,"As a hardcore devotee for many years, I am ""truly, truly disappointed"". Anti-American - OK, fine, we get it. Fair enough. But the complaining is as unimaginative as the music. This is lazy. This is really boring. Shame on you Stevie."
1,To Say The Least I'm Truly Dissapointed,"I'm a really die-hard Morrissey fan. I even found much to like about his much-panned Kill Uncle album (especially Harsh Truth of the Camera Eye: Brilliant), and I was very excited to get this one based on all the great reviews and because I liked quite a few songs on You Are The Quarry, but the first listen was very dissapointing. It sounded like a mishmash of everything else that came before put in a blender and chopped up into a confusing hodgepodge. Perhaps later (after I recover my eqiuilibrium) I can go back and try to let it ""grow on me"" as other reviewers have done. What a shame to become a petri dish of a fan. There are so many songs of his so beautiful that never had to grow on me but just flowed into my soul all at once with no photosyntesis necessary."
1,"ATROCIOUS,WHERE ARE PINK FLOYD WHEN YOU NEED THEM","Morrisey is amongst the worst of the worst.He was a vocalist of the lousy Smiths who thankfully disbanded.I cant stop stressing how bad this album is.Dont buy this awful album from this irrelevant singer.If you buy this you are a SUCKER.TO GIVE THIS ONE STAR IS BEING KIND.Get any album from great bands like PINK FLOYD,LED ZEPPELIN and DEEP PURPLE instead."
4,Geez...,"You cant expect every single album an artist puts out to be the most wonderful, groundbreaking piece of music ever made. RotT is a little more stripped and straightforward but I personally appreciate it for that. Give ol' Moz a break, there's nothing at all wrong with this album and it certainly isn't deserving of some of the criticisms I've been reading on here. Its good music from a great artist and performer, just appreciate it for what it is instead of decrying it for what it's not."
4,4 1/2 stars.,"selected my mojo magazine as the 11th best album of 2006, and by Q magazine as the 47th, this is an excellent production of fine pop songs. morrissey's vocals are stunning as usual and the songs melodic and fine. i love the old classic smiths albums, but this is only the 2nd solo morrissey recording that i've heard. excellent stuff, and i want to hear more."
3,You are the Quarry was better,"Ringleader is a good Cd, it just doesn,t seem to rock out at all. I gave Quarry (enhanced) 5 stars. This one gets 3 1/2. The music is nice it just seems like I,ve heard it before. You Have Killed Me has some good hooks on it and was a good choice for the first single, but where I have some very tasty potatoes here I never did get the meat. I will give 5 stars to one song though, At Last I Am Born. I think this song is very powerful and a great closer to the CD. A great falsetto on Moz,s voice and the opening orchestration to the song is very rich.If you don,t have it this is a good CD but get You Are The Quarry (enhanced) and you,ll see it,s much better."
4,Moz writes great lyrics once again...,"but the music is a bit too slow this go around. I like the atmospheric Visconti production, but Moz should include some faster songs. ""Life is a Pigsty"" is a brilliant slow number, so that should stay. Still, it's Morrissey, so it's much better than most album's out today."
4,Sounds good to me,"Looking over the reviews, it seems as though many astute Morrissey fans find this effort mediocre at best. I don't know. I like it. ""You Have Killed Me"" features remarkably surprising lyrics, powerful vocals and an unforgettable melody. ""At Last I Am Born"" hit me the same way. My favorite tune by far is ""Life Is a Pigsty"". Besides the quintessential Morrissey title, the song is oozing with passion, and somehow manages to be grim and uplifting at the same time, as many of Morrissey's better efforts do. True, some of the other tunes are rather routine by Morrissey standards, but these three alone make Ringleader worth the $$."
5,"If you like Morrissey, this is a very good album.",I think there are at least five very strong songs on this album. Buy it.
3,This album's full of crashing bores,"Nowhere near the calibre of ""Quarry,"" which is 5+ stars in my estimation. The only truly good song on this album is ""You Have Killed Me."" I kind of like ""The Father Who Must Be Killed,"" even though Pitchfork singled that one out as possibly the worst Moz song ever. They got it wrong: the final track, ""At Last I am Born"" is the worst ever. His singing is atrocious. And that makes me weep. Like another reviewer, I'm only giving it three stars because it's Moz, and less than 3 stars are reserved for lesser artists or truly awful albums, which this is not. But it's not really good, either. Get ""Quarry"" if you want an album full of beautiful singing, witty lyrics, great production, and almost every song makes you want to hit the repeat button."
4,Swiss Army Flash Drive,The SwissMemory I purchased is only a flash drive but is a very good design and quality. Have not tried to get it by TSA yet so that should be interesting. Highly recommended.
1,Havent recieved,"I have'nt Recieved this item yet. Im very disappointed its been long enough to have got it. so i'm not happy at all with this buy, Thank You"
5,"A Neat, Precise History","I bought a used copy of this 1972 edition in a book store in Eureka, CA. Being a student of WWI biographies and autobiographies, I decided I had to have it, especially since it was only seven dollars. Mr. Gray has crafted a fine, small history of WWI submarine warfare. I think he took some small liberties but none that distract from a fine work. I wish the author had describe submarine life a little more completely as well as early twentieth century engineering problems and diving physiology. Still, the work is very nicely done and highly recommended. I tried to find Mr. Gray's email address to let him know how much I thought of his work but that doesn't seem to be possible."
5,Really teaches a good lesson,"We checked this out of the library months ago, but the message really hit home with my 3-year-old daughter. Now whenever she is being bossy and rude, we can just point out that she is being like ""Rodney Dog"" and she gets the message."
2,Not worth the money,"Perhaps this book would suffice as a surface reference, but it should not be used as the primary text for any course. The coverage is sparse at best, and it seems unlikely that anyone who didn't already understand the topics covered could do so with this book alone.Perhaps it serves a purpose, but it cannot be used extensively."
5,Doggie,My maltese loved this toy but just passed away 5 days before christmas 2012 at only 8 yrs old. Silly but I leave it on his pillow that lays next to me in bed. Best toy every for smaller dog breeds.
5,China loves it!,My dog (Pug) took to this right away. She played for quite a long time before removing all the contents. I recommend it. And I think China does too!
1,The toy is no more,The puppy had it destroyed within 2 days. I do not recommend this dog toy if your dog is a playful puppy.
4,My puppy mostly enjoys running squeaking the balls,"Fun seeing her nose deep in the cube trying to get the balls. Not enough challenge and doesn't keep her interest too long. I usually have to toss it to get her interest back, that doesn't always work. I tried the treats but she usually shakes the cube right away and the treats fall out. What's the challenge in that. Takes me longer to put the treats in. The balls are great for fetch and she loves running around squeaking them. Overall not a bad toy."
1,"Puppy destroyed this in days, small plastic parts, dangerous as hell","My puppy is 3 pounds. She's not very destructive, and is rather small (Yorkie-Bichon mix). She destroyed these balls in a few days. What comes out of them is plastic-y cottony material that she can choke on, and even better, lots of small plastic parts that are perfect for choking her to death. I'm astounded that she was able to destroy this thing in a matter of days, and even more astounded that it's full of small plastic parts just the right size to kill her. I'm more than a bit ticked. Do not buy this."
3,Not Great for Pugs,"I purchased the IQube on the advice of our trainer. We have a 6 month old pug, who of course doesn't have a true snout. I gave him the toy and with in 10 minutes he gave up, because he couldn't get his mouth into the box to get the balls.However, all was not lost. He loves the plush squeaky balls. We also take out the balls and hide pieces of biscuits inside of the box.If you have a flat-faced dog (i.e. pug, bulldog), I would suggest just buying the replacement balls, which they just started sellling separately."
2,easily destroyed,"I had to give this thing props bc my dogs absolutely loved it and loved pulling the balls out. That takes all of 5 seconds, though, so it doesn't keep them occupied for too long...then they just tore the balls apart and then proceeded to tear the box apart.These are 2 55 pound collies...not giant dogs known for chewing.So...fun while it lasted. Now it's dead and in the trash."
4,For average intelligence dogs only,"Just kidding, mostly...I showed this toy to my German Shepherd, and without any hesitation, she picked the box up and ran around the house squeaking it. Why would she remove the balls when she could squeak them from the outside? ;) However, she loves it and was quite concerned when we removed the balls so we could watch TV/do homework...she'll get them when we leave the house, haha. If your dog's too smart for this, try the Wobbler (loud on wooden floors). I'm going to try to pick up a puzzle for her that she can't cheat on.Still, if a dog likes squeakies, they're sure to love this, as well as the variations (squirrels, bees, rabbits...all sorts of silly things)."
2,destroyed,"we no longer buy plush toys for our dog. it's a waste of money. this one lasted a little longer since the balls were spherical and didn't have easy edges to chew/rip. but without a doubt, our pooch found a way to break the seams and spread the stuffing all over. if your dog is like ours, stay away."
4,Fun but too short!,"I have an eight month poodle and she loved the box and getting the balls out. She also loves chewing on the balls. By the end of week two, all the balls were split and had to be replaced. I bought balls for a dollar to replace the ones that came in the box and she continues to enjoy her toy. She likes playing tug with the box (she holds it in her mouth and I have to pull at it).I also use the box to hid a treat in another container that she has to open to eat the treat."
2,"Great concept, poor quality.",I've have purchased other puzzle/intelligence toys from this line and have been very pleased with them. Each product has been of high quality and my dog has LOVED them. I was very disappointed when the I-Qube arrived as it was not only slightly smaller than described but all of the balls accompanying it had defective squeekers which caused it to be unstimulating for my pup who is very high energy and sensory focused.
3,Dogs like it....but not used as intended,"Though my dogs like this toy, they like it more as a chew toy than an interactive ""digging"" toy. We've had it for a week, and all 3 of them like to make it squeak, toss it around ect, but none of them have mastered the concept of pulling out the balls (or just don't want to..). I have 2 other toys similar to this one (hide-a-squirrel) and they LOVE pulling the animals out of the toy, for some reason, not so much on this. It is a bit smaller (junior)....my mini dachshund can fit his mouth in it, but not my springer or lab."
5,BEST TOY EVER,This was the best toy that we could have bought. We have a Jack Russel who loves this toy. The only down side is that the cube its self is easily chewed at the openings. She get frustrated when she cant pull out the balls and chews it! Still her favorite toy by far! She pulls the balls out one by one and runs around squeeking them and showing off! Well worth the money we spent on it!
2,Bad Product,I have ordered several of these in the past. The squeakers in the item I just received do not work. I believe that I was sent a used and defective item.
3,Like it pretty good,"We have a 5 month Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. He plays with toys for a short time then is ready to move on - this toy was pretty much the same. He dug the balls out, then wasn't as interestd in doing it again. However, the balls are good and we use them for fetch and every now and then he will dig them out again."
2,The cube is really small and tight,"The balls are very difficult for me to get out even with two hands & knowing how to do it. Unless your dog *really* likes puzzle toys and knows what to do with them, I'd order the larger size first because at least it has room to get the nose in there and grab the balls."
4,Make up your own mind,"I agree with Trevor. I read both books back to back about 10 years ago and really enjoyed them for what they were. While some people were disappointed in how the characters acted, you have to remember that people deal with grief in different ways. Poor Elliot lost his daughter not once but twice. Bill and Janice's relationship changes drastically because of what happened in the first book.In my opinion, if Frank had tried to keep the characters more or less the same as there were in the first book the second one would have been a disaster. It was interesting to me to see how each character changed and developed in the second book. The alluded to affair in a previous comment isn't as out of character as the comment author thinks if you keep an open mind.I recommend reading the book. If you're unsure about making a monetary investment to do so, check it out of the local library. If nothing else you can write a review on here and tell us if your for or against the sequel."
1,If you liked the first do not read this one,This book totally ruins the feel of the first. It absolutley destroys the feelings that you got after finishing the first. Ivy's mother is taking her death okay...however Mr. Templeton was instituationized and forces Mrs. Templeton to try to find Ivy's reincarnation. Look People get over it...look what happened the first time!!!!! The book is filled with different characters with the same name. It was horrible.
4,Great camera case - really useful,I agree with the other reviews that said the side pockets were a bit tight for two lenses. I'm using one side pocket for an additional lens and the other for a separate flash. I couldn't be happier!
4,Tight side compartments but great bag.,"This is a well made and attractive bag, and at a terrific price here on clearance. (OfficeMax has it at $49.95). The side pockets are tight for my 70-300 zoom lens and offer reduced protection. My Canon 430EX flash fits but tight there. Bag feels a bit top-heavy, but that doesn't bother me. I mainly use it as my second bag with just my Canon Digital Rebel. Offers good protection and reasonably light weight."
4,Excellent Camera bag,"I always known Case Logic as the maker of several execellent products such as CD and computer cases, but never camera bag. So after reading several good reviews for this bag, I decided to try it. And I was not disappointed. Not that I need another camera bag, but this is bag that I will use often.The camera bag has a water-sealed bottom, so you never have to worry about your camera getting wet if you put it down somewhere. The best feature is an adjustable suspension system inside, so your camera has added protection. However, the cirular hole only fit small lens and it is almost unusable. Most digital lens now are much larger than that. The two side pockets are nice for assessoried, forget about putting extra lenses as Case Logic advertised. The overall construction is high quality, with lots of storage space. It's a good looking bag too.If you only go out for a day with one SLR and a multi-purpose zoom lens, this is probably the best choice."
4,"Great value, but a tight fit for many DSLRs.","I have a number of Case Logic cases for different devices as they'e well thought out, well made, and generally a very good value. This particular case was a good fit for my Nikon D80, but less so for the D70. But for the typical small ""prosumer"" DSLR, like the D40/D50 and their successors, it's a good fit. I've since sold my DSLRs and moved to a non-moving mirror system (micro 4/3rds) so I passed this case on to a friend's daughter who had good use for it."
3,Undersized lens compartments,"Very good build quality. I like the neoprene ""hammock"" lens suspension system which stabilizes and cushions the equipment very effectively. Small accessory storage for memory cards, lens cloths, batteries, etc. is very good. Unfortunately, the side compartments which are apparently designated as lens storage are far too small to accommodate all but the smallest lenses of any of the major SLR/DSLR manufacturers. They are better suited for small accessories such as remotes or filters. Great concept, but inadequately designed. The product name is ""camera and 2 lenses case"", so I expected more."
3,Heavy dose of Monty bashing,This is Burgett's personal account in Operation Market Garden. A good read if you enjoy first-person accounts sprinkled with liberal dose of humor.
4,You have to fill in the blank!,"First of all...since this book is so cheap and fills in the gap between two of the best WWII books out there (currahee and 7 roads) it is on my must read list...and with its length it is an easy 2 day read. But I must admit I was just a little bit disappointed...maybe because of Burgett's other two books I became an action junky, but this book seemed to never get going. He does give wonderful insight into the market garden operation and his writing, as usual, is easy flowing and descriptive. But his unit doesn't seem to run into alot of trouble, and if they did it wasn't portrayed in the fashion of his normandy and bastogne experience. Please don't think I am criticizing one of our nations heroes and one of my personal favorites, but I imagined the holland fight to be a bit hairier and those looking for a WWII memoir are probably looking for the same thing.a great read however and for the price and length a must buy..."
3,"Baseline, no frills","The book has all the songs from the broadway show, Big River, but all the pieces have only the melody part. Any harmony or chorus parts you were hoping to get are not there. This works for simple performances but not for any duets or ensembles."
5,I am a new fan of this not-so-new artist,"I stumbled across Jimmy Nail while researching info on Mark Knopfler. Although well known in the UK, Jimmy Nail was completely new to me. Further research led me to an online video of the tune ""Big River,"" featuring both Nail and MK, which I instantly liked. I used RDIO to hear the entire Big River CD, and liked it so much that I bought the physical CD. If you like the Mark Knopfler style of storytelling and singing you will likely appreciate Jimmy Nail. All of the tracks are interesting and very well-produced."
5,The Warrior Review,This book is great reading I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read books in their spare time.
1,Horrible sound makes accessment of the interpretation impossible.,"This recording sounds more like 1930 than 1950. A narrow 'perspective' even for mono, poor balance (the organ at the beginning for example conquers all), and general harshness. I picked this up as a $2 cut-out and can't recommend it even at that price."
5,Excellent decission,"Yes, i made an excellent decission. The router worked right out of the box with no problems. It's easy to install and you even get the UTP cable needed to plug the router in the PC. The only thing missing in this first step was the manual installation guide, that is supposed to be printed and it just wasnt there.I tried to use the automatic installation but it just didnt work. And it also didnt say WHY my PC wasnt compatible, but i thought that was a mistake. So i read the pdf guide for manual installation and everything worked like a charm. One word of notice: i was expecting the router to connect to the internet right after pluging the router, but it doesnt work that way. You first need to configure it.After everything was installed, i turned on my two wireless machines (one with a standard wireless nic) and they all connected with no problems.I know motorola isnt known for its wireless broadband products, but it they really work perfectly well."
4,It's running Linux kernel 2.4,"This little router is running a 2.4 kernel. Brain, if OSX has the unzip application that's available for nearly all Unices then you should be able to unpack the ""exe""; I just did it after reading your review.Reception is very good even through walls where my defunct DI-614+ failed. I have a Linux machine with an Atheros PCI card as a router and it doesn't interfere.(...)Withing 10 minutes of accessing the unit I receive the error message.I have already recommended it to one person.(...)For the moment it's working well and I'm happy."
2,didn't work very well,when I tried to put a security code for the wireless it locked the wireless and couldn't open it again. the coverage was not bad at all for a small apartment.
3,ok,"I just ordered the v2 after having a v3 for almost 3 years. I like the idea that I can add an extended more powerful antenna, which you cannot with the v3, whose cable I snapped after ordering this!"
2,"A dead, weightless book","Deadweight doesn't offer much in the way of suspense... It has no character development whatsoever, opting instead to concentrate on endless sequences of sex, torture and gore and in all, is a distasteful study of degradation towards women... Not to mention the absurdity of the subplot about the lead ""heroine"" who has the ability to revive wilted flowers, hence the explanation for the resurrection of her long buried husband and his equally blood-thirsty dog. It's definitely not for the squeamish but if your stomach can handle it, then more than likely, it's your interest that won't be able to."
4,A Good Solution,"I looked all over before I managed to find the Entry Eagle. Everything else is very expensive, or part of a bigger home intercom system. I did not buy it from Amazon, but I would have if they offered it when I bought the unit some months ago.The peephole in the inside unit is at the top, and the peephole in the outside unit is at the bottom (unlike as is shown in the picture), so I was concerned that the outside unit would be hard to keep vertical, but it works fine. The unit hugs the door, without flopping around at all. My door came with the correct diameter hole, so I needed no alterations. The unit did install in minutes, but it was easier to install with help, since you have to tuck the wire into a recess in the outside unit while tightening the peephole on the inside.Also, I thought it might look kind of cheesy, but it does not -- , in my opinion it looks pretty sturdy.I happy with the unit, and I would recommend it to my friends."
2,Color Shipped not the same as photo,The photo showed this item in white. No description mentioned alternate color selections. We have a black and white door and the white would have worked fine. When the shipment arrived the product shipped was a dark tan color. It simply was not the same as advertised. We returned for a full refund.
2,Intercom Viewing System,"This product is bulky, a different color than displayed, of low quality and not worth the listed price. I suggest buying higher quality products that provide the same type of intercom/viewing capability."
4,Super-Size Dora!,"Great life-like, educational doll, but the super-size head could be intimidating for the smaller toddler. I worry about the doll toppling over and possibly causing injury. My recommended age would be 5+."
1,Mother of three,I bought three of the Dora Friendship Adventure Doll for Christmas 2007. I have twin girls 4 and a 3 year old girl. The only reason I bought these dolls was because it was on sale for $39.99 from amazon and also I thought my three girls would really be excited to have it. However the were excited for the first 5 minutes and after that they never play with the doll again. The doll is too heavy. The head is extremely big. It is dangerous for any toddler without adults supervising. I believe if this doll should fall on a child age two or under they would be serously hurt. I am concerned for my own daughters.Please think carefully before you buy this because I think sometime in the near future there might be a recall because of too many kids getting hurt.
2,Dora Friendship Adventure Doll Review,The doll came and was huge. The head of the doll is so heavy it is hard for Dora to stand alone. The hair gets tangled and is very hard to comb for my child. I am not sure I would purchase this product again.
2,WEIGHS AT LEAST 25LBS!!!! HEAD IS SO BIG IT FALLS OVER,"THE DOLL IS HEAVY, MY DAUGHTER CANNOT EVEN CARRY IT AROUND THE HOUSE EASILY , ITS A STRUGGLE TO MOVE AROUND. BUT, IT IS ADORABLE, IT DOES NOT SAY AS MUCH PHRASES AS IT SAYS IT DOES BUT YOUR CHILD WILL BE THE ENVY OF ALL HER FRIENDS. OVERALL OK, BUT THE THING CAN HURT YOUR KID."
4,The biggest hit at Christmas!!,I got this for my 2 year old daughter & she just loves it! We call her Gigantor Dora because she is taller than my daughter! It was a great price before Christmas & free shipping!! Terrific value:)
4,what a buy,i bought this doll for my triplet grandchildren who adore dora..it was a big hit..even my grandon loved her and wanted her to sit right next to him at the dinner table..i actually got a great deal on a special through amazon so that made it so much better..
3,Overrated!!,I purchased this toy for my then 4 year old daughter. She liked it at first until Dora's hair became a tangled mess. The doll doesn't stand on its own for too long and if it falls on a small child it hurts!! The doll is not in the closet and out the way ready to be put into the trash can.I would definately say that it is not worth it!!
5,Only what I have seen,"I have not yet openned the box, because it is a X-mas present for my 3 year old. Just by looking at it I can already imagine my daughter loving it. This toy will be fun and educational because my little one will be able to play and have fun with Dora: feeding her, sharing, dressing her etc. I think I will be satisfied with this purchase at Amazon."
3,It's Okay,"My daughter was so excited when she received Dora, but when she started to play with it, it only did two lines.It did not come with an instructions manual and I was not able to find more information online either.Although it's cute - it was a bit of a let down."
4,My size dora,"I bought this doll for my 4 yr old niece. She loves it, but it is bigger than she is, so she basically drags it around. The phrases are fun to listen to and somewhat educational...although it quickly gets annoying. The best part of the doll is the hair, she loves playing with it. The worst part is the enormous head (it can't even fit in a suitcase). This doll is def worth the price, especially for Dora lovers."
4,This doll is enormous!,"My 4 year old daughter received this doll for Christmas. It is very sturdy, the quality seems very good. Only problem is, my kid can't lift it. She does play with it, but I'm afraid it's going to fall over and knock someone out! Her head is huge.We laughed when we first saw it - it reminds us of ET! It'll be a workout for my 4year old to dress Dora and stand her up! But, she loves it, and I guess that's all that matters!"
1,Dora,"I bought this doll for my three year old. As with all kids they love Dora Dora. Unfortuately, we are military stationed in Okinawa, Japan and choices here are limited. The doll was ordered on line Dec. 19th for christmas but we have not received it yet. Amazon did a refund for the doll, but I would have preferred the doll as they are hard to get here in Japan. I know my daughter would have loved it as she has so many other Dora products.Out of all the products received through Amazon, this is the only one not to arrived. I,m very pleased with their service thus far, as this was not their faught. It's somewhere in the mail. Thanks Amazon...USMC Devil-dog"
1,It broke in two months.,"I had this only a couple months. they are made in China now. I bought it off ebay because it was cheap. Now I know why it was cheap.They used to be made in the USA, and have a good reputation. I bought this, and it only lasted two months, and then quit. Nobody could fix it properly- they said the insides looked different now that it is made in China.Don't buy one."
2,It stopped working for no reason,"It worked for a while, then it stopped working. I found the fuse was burned, I replaced it and now it only makes a buzzing sound, so I don't think I could recommend this amplifier."
4,NEW INSIGHT,"Within 850+pagesMR.Stein has touch all the major aspects of DSP theory &applications, includeing statistical concepts too.Though I am not a computer personal (but electronic) presentation & explanations have been stimulated me to have a different synthesis of concepts & ideas of DSP.This naturally led me to a good understanding with a good insight.Rich historical details & end of the chapter biblographical notes are very useful features for a mature reader.Although my vivews may not be relevant to a absolute biginer this type of book is a invaluable at certain stage of one's education.Typhos are a little problem."
3,Well... neh,"While the book is plumb full of interesting ideas and really abstract and creative details, it's really not the coolest Exalted book so far. In fact, since the Dragonblooded came out, I wonder where the authors' coolness ran. While reading the book I get flashed images of a bunch of middle aged former D&Ders sitting around a table, drinking soda and eating potato chips, trying to fit every single idea into this book. (Like a ""Dual Monarchy"" which is actually four personalities. Wait? Monarchy? Dual? What?) It's far too detailed, and this really takes away from those initial ""cool ideas.""Yeah, the powers are cool, and Abyssals are tanks to fear -- that much is true. Don't by this book for the literature or the setting."
4,Great Comedy,"Most of the guys in this stand up are newbies, good? well not too bad. Could be better...Still this is a great set to buy! Great value for money and hours of entertainment. Recommended to all!"
3,A bit of a hassle to use,"I regret buying this locking fuel cap because it is a bit of a hassle to use. And beware, you have to make sure you have the key with you at all times, or you will be stranded at a gas station unable to pump gas because you don't have the key to the cap. So seriously consider whether you need this product or not.I was also told (after buying this cap) that my SUV has an anti-siphon locking mechanism built in. You should check to see if your car has the same prior to purchasing this."
4,Tedious Indeed,"As the previous reviewer stated, this movie is quite a bit tedious. It was like the African Queen without any tension or love story. We kept waiting for a German warboat to appear at the end, but all that showed up was a rusty old speedboat. The Mayor and Chief of Police of New Orleans and the Governor of Louisiana were thanked at the end, but we are sure that they wish that their names were not attached to the movie. Pretty funny on the riff side, but definitely a movie for more advanced MST3Kers."
3,Non-Fiction,"A big fat physics textbook of its day.You can also disguise it as a tome of wisdom for parties, it is that large.Not a whole lot of fun this one, and not that good in general, just another of those textbooks inflicted on poor student types because they can.2.5 out of 5"
1,Way too small,"At best you can only just about squeeze in the camera in this bag and may be a spare battery. There is no way you can fit in an extra lens over even the battery charger (and if you cant carry different lens, what's the point of getting an SLR?). You cant even squeeze in a filter set, forget about lens. They should stop advertising this case as a camera holster case for SLRs. So, if you plan to go for long trips and have even an inkling of trying different lens/filter settings, stay away from this bag since you wont be able to fit in everything over here. Nonetheless it will work nicely for smaller digital cameras. I am VERY disappointed with this product and plan to trash it and buy a different one."
5,"Good protection, perfect size","I bought this case for my new Lumix camera and it fits perfectly. Plenty of room for an extra battery, filters and additional SD cards."
5,Lost & Found,"I very much enjoyed this book. Written in a ""story"" form, Lost & Found clearly illustrates core leadership values. From the beginning chapter, 'Why Me?' to the final entitled, 'Out of the Woods', the book's primary character, Larry Parks embarks upon a journey that many of us have either witnessed in others or have taken ourselves. Dr. Sussman and his co-authors have composed a classic that should be read by every individual in a position of leadership or who aspires to be a leader. I have purchased copies of Lost & Found for 12 others in my organization and have had rave reviews from everyone. Please do yourselves a favor and puchase this book; better yet purchase additional copies and give to your friends and colleagues."
1,"wrong part, right part #","Please understand I am not mad but you are selling the wrong gauge and I don't know what to do other than to let you know. If you look at the picture of the gauge sold under the part # 91132, it has little triangular wings one on each side. These wings as pictured give the gauge better stability when used on a flat belt. The part # is right, the picture is right, the part # on the box was right but the gauge inside was not. The one you sent out does not have wings and it also has a raised line of metal on one edge of the bottom that makes it impossible to measure the stress of a wide flat belt.I would send it back but it would cost me almost half of what it cost to buy it. I would really like to get the one pictured if possible. Any thing you can do, I appreciate it. Please if nothing else, just let me know you got this...The only reason I gave it a low rating was it was not what I ordered. The one pictured is what I need..."
3,Better instructions would be nice,"I initially bought this belt tension gauge for my 1990 ford ranger.It took me a few minutes to understand how to use it since the instructions were not crystal clear.Honestly it proved ineffective to test my serpentine belt. I probably didn't use it properly, which is why better instructions would have been nice.However, it is only $20-25 which is not bad for a belt tension gauge. It is also small and will fit in any toolbox."
1,Make sure the Range is correct,The tension range for this is 100-320 lbs and I needed a lower range gauge. The accuracy is another question.
4,Very good and cheap alternative for digital gauge,Works accurate enough for correct belt tension.Can recommend it for the amateur who can't spend hundreds of dollars on digital gauges.
2,Defective?,"So, I read the reviews on Amazon.I read reviews on the rest of the internet.I watched the video on Youtube where they showed you how to use it.Armed with all of this knowledge on how to use it, I tried it out.I tried it on 5 different things: 2 cars, 1 pickup truck, 1 drill press, and 1 air compressor.All of them were supposedly tensioned to 50 pounds.Maybe there's something I'm doing wrong. Sure can't think of what it is, though..."
3,Something Fresh and New,"I first heard of Michael Johnson on the jazz station WCLK in Atlanta. This station is different from the norm and will play artist that are not the norm. His music has a ""drum machine"" sound to it. No real instruments but, nothing over techical. His voice and music together kind of reminds me of Maxwell's last attempt with Embrya. Each track is long enough for you to get a good feel for his production talents although by using computers and drum machines to make his music, it starts to sound the same after the 6th track. This is one of those albums that you may or may not like at first. It took me a few spins in the CD deck to start to feel it. But if you want to hear something other than the junk being passed off as music then check this out. If you like this you also may like Remy Shand."
4,Good home office color printer,"I've had this printer for a few weeks. It produces great quality prints, especially on nicer (photo) paper. I like the small footprint, design of the printer, speed, and quality. Lexmark has a great environmental policy. You can send empty cartridges to the company for recycling. They also have both normal and high-yield cartridges. For a little extra money, you can get twice the number of prints.Cons: It does drain the electricity--expect house lights to flicker! It was disturbing at first, but I'm used to it now. The printer is loud when it operates, silent when powered down. The duplex option is expensive, if you need that functionality. You'll also need to buy another paper feeder for larger paper sizes.Overall, I'm extremely pleased. I'm on a Macintosh system and had no trouble with drivers or set up. I would research and buy other Lexmark products if they received favorable reviews."
1,Poor color print quality . Buyer beware.,"If you need to do even low-volume color printing on card stock, don't buy this printer. It leaves streaks down both sides of the paper and skeletonizes color images. I've changed out the color cartridges twice at great expense, because the troubleshooting guide attributes streaking to defective toner cartridges. There was no improvement whatsoever. An expensive disappointment."
4,Our present Culture and where it came from.,"Another excellent book for a group study about why our culture is going the way it is, the beginning of how it was created and how it changed through the years."
5,LaserJet 4350TN,A great printer. Very Fast and easy setup. This is the 2nd one of this model that I have had and is working great!
5,AWESOME AND TALENTED!,WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND GREAT ALBUM FOR THE FIRST OF O-TOWN! I'M SURE THAT THIS IS ONE OF MANY O-TOWN RECORDS!
1,Poor quality keyboard,"Along with the already mentioned problems is one musical factor not covered-the keys have no touch senstivity. For anyone serious about playing or using it as an early learning tool, it is useless."
1,Horrible piano sound,"Our school had previously purchased Casio keyboards. I had to replace a few keyboards and thought that this slightly less expensive Casio keyboard would have the same piano sound, even though it had less bells and whistles. It's piano setting doesn't even come close to satisfactory. Parents, if you are looking for a beginning keyboard, please spend a little more money and provide a better piano sound for your child.A few of my students also figured out how to make microphones out of their headphones (just insert headphone jack into the mic jack and talk into the head piece --kids will try anything)"
1,Terrible Product,"I got this as a present last Christmas and opened it today; I'm disappointed that I didn't return it then.Having had a real piano in my house and looking for something for my college dorm, this doesn't even remotely cut it. The keyboard overall sounds very tinny and fake, even to me as nearly a complete novice. As someone mentioned the keys have zero touch sensitivity. It's got plenty of fancy features that I'm sure a few people will like, but I really just wanted to be able to use a decent sounding keyboard, and this failed miserably.I'd have trouble warranting spending $25 for a product like this, nevermind $100.1/5."
2,more like a toy than an instrument,my main problem with the keyboard is it sounded cheap and nothing like the real thing. really cheap. i wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
3,casio ctk 496,"For a hundred bucks you cant go wrong if your just beginning. I borrowed this model from my cousin for 6 months and it did the job. the sounds are terrible(compared to the real thing) but when it comes to needing something to play it will work, i thought about buying one at target for 100 , but i just received my casio px 130 yesterday. overall the ctk 496 would be great for children who have never played because if they dont like playing in a few months at least your not spending a fortune. its lightweight, seemed to me fairly strong,i brought it everywhere when i had it. if you are looking for something better with full keys check out the px 120 they just dropped the price on AMS i did own the px 120 for a week until i exchanged for the 130, the casio privias are unbelievable for the price.Any parents looking to get their kids off videogames, this is it. you cant go wrong for the price you get what you pay for."
1,Plextor External PX-504UF 4X/2.4X/12X ( PX-504UF/SW ),"This proved to be an extremely difficult piece of hardware to use and I do not recommended it for the following reasons;Firstly the firmware it came with had to be upgraded to make the burner functional, the software it came bundled with was largely useless for burning a DVD and thirdly the USB connections proved to be very temperamental in that the burner keeps switching back to a CD burner from a DVD burner and the system has to be rebooted.In addition the system was very fussy with media and wouldn't use HP or Sony DVD +R's.The technical support department at Plextor also proved to be less than helpful putting the blame squarely on the USB drivers and didn't even suggest how to work round the problem."
1,Confusion is the word,"I bought one of these about a year ago and have to say that am very unhappy with it....First of all it was hard to get my pc to recognize the dvd recording features even after installing the software drivers that came with it..then I had to get a third party DVD burning software to burn my dvds..the ones that came with its install were crap..After all of that was done and I thought I was ready to burn dvd's I kept getting error messages saying that there was no dvd disc in the player, and I tried every single dvd format available...it took me probably a good month to get it to burn dvd..although now I don't even burn dvds anymore with it.. to much of a Hassale...I seriously don't recommend it...even if it cost only $20.00..."
2,"Barely effective, with a caveat","I have owned this pump for about 2 years now. It certainly is the smallest, lightest pump out there, but it can only inflate a road tube to about 60 psi(I've seen riders bend stems pumping away with this little wheezer). Thats ok to limp home on from a training ride, but it's not good enough if you are self suppporting or want to finish a long ride after dealing with a flat. You will be better off with a more substantial pump or CO2. Recommended as a back up only.Follow up - Got a flat tire mountain biking last month (tube type set-up). Thought I had my larger pump along, but it turned out to be this one in the camelback. Turns out it pumped up the mountain bike tube just fine (lots of pumps required of course, it doesn't move much air). Apparently this pump is ok getting pressures in mtb range (55 psi in this case), but can't get a road tube even close to 100. So now this pump is in the mountain bike repair kit."
5,Calling all Basset Lovers!,"This is a wonderful book, both the photographs and text. I liked it so much that I bought six copies for all of my friends and family who have Basset Hounds!Nothing, and I mean, nothing disappointing in this book! A must for Bassset fans!"
5,I love Maggie!,An this book did not disappoint. Wonderful photos with cute. funny and inspiring text - all from a funny little basset hound named Maggie.
4,Very nice...but,A very nice shirt...sizing was good on mine and i love that its made in the USA. The bummer.....hand wash and hang to dry.....wish it was machine wash and dry....
4,Superb New Talent - We Need a U.S. Release,"I first heard Mark Joseph when his song ""Fly"" was featured on an episode of Smallville. The hooks of that song really stood out...so much so that I went to the WB's website to find out who the song was by. Never heard of Mark Joseph before, but after listening to song samples from his ""Scream"" CD I decided to purchase it. Very impressive. ""Scream"" contains mostly mellow acoustic-type songs that are very catchy. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what his ""sound"" is, but there are definite Beatles and Billy Joel influences in the style and singing, particularly with the harmonies. Some people may find that his style isn't varied enough on this CD, but each song really grew on me. Very impressed by this new talent, and very surprised I haven't seen a U.S. release for this yet. Mark Joseph's ""Scream"" is a CD worth checking out."
1,Wrong item pictured....,"The item pictured IS NOT a range finder - but the Bushnell ""NightHawk"" night vision device. Apparently they have mixed up the photos. Please be aware of what you are buying....."
4,Nice sander,"I haven't used this very much yet, but I like the way it fits your hand and it does sand very well. I don't like the dust bag because it seems to get in the way and really doesn't keep the dust down that much. Of course, I have never seen a sander who's dust bag attachment works very well. Over all I think it's a good sander."
4,"Good for the money, two to show!","I've had the Makita now for about 5 years, and use it now much less often than when I first got it. It is a Good sander! Vibration is fast, cuts fast with 100 grit paper, and does a fine job of finishing with 200 grit or smaller. While it's dust bag can be replaced with a vacuum hose, that is just too unhandy for most jobs. The dust bag does not catch much dust!Out of several sander that I own ( hobbyist) this is my favorite. It seems well-made, and should last me a long time to come! Changing sandpaper is no easier, nor any harder than with other sanders of like genre."
5,Excellent 80s Christian pop,"This is one of the greatest 80s Christian pop albums ever created. If that seems too niche, then let me say that it's just a great 80s pop album, period, with lyrics that happen to reflect Christian faith. From first song to last, the earnest, earnest, heartfelt delivery and flawless keyboards will transport you back to a time when the world was brightly colored and extraneous zippers ruled. Get it!"
3,An Oldie,The web page describing this book could be more forthcoming. The book was published in 1980 and is being re-issued now. Downgraded to three stars for hiding information.
2,Not the best of Droopy!,"There are better Droopy cartoons out there folks! And the one with the Hungry Wolf? Are you kidding? It does not belong on this videotape...or any videotape.If you want real Droopy, you must seek out The Adventures of Droopy. It has the real goods. Of course, it is impossible to find...but if you find it, email me and we can celebrate together!!! Long live Droopy!!!"
4,1966 Ford Truck Shop Manual,At over 1400 pages this is good value for $24.95. Best information is on F series trucks with twin I beam suspension and good details on all rear axles. Does not contain front axle information on C-series trucks that have solid axle and kingpins.
3,One thing that really bothers me...,"I am a socialist (for those who need to pigeon hole me) and I do believe in the serious environmental issues facing all species (including humanity) in the very near future. But I also like to review the basics, the details, and there one thing that particularly bothers me about Al Gore's interest in ""spreading the word"". If he is so interested in making a real difference and this is such an important message why isn't Al Gore authorizing the release of ""An Inconvenient Truth"" film for free over the Internet? I mean, I know movies and books cost money .. certainly he can make enough from book sales to cover his costs. Instead of asking for people to pledge to see the movie why isn't Gore asking people to pledge toward making positive world changes? This seems inconsistant with the mission, doesn't it?"
5,Wake-up call,"This book, though primarily and mainly addressed to Americans, has been very informative and helped me understand more about global warming. The practical steps suggested at the latter part of the book is worth sharing and relating to relatives and friends."
3,Revenue Raising Publication,"The book is the presentation Mr Gore delivered world-wide over the last few years, without the accompanying dialogue. If it wasn't for the importance of the content, this book would rank 1-2 stars. The material should have been developed for the medium of a book. Many of the impressive graphics and images lose impact through the fold of the spine, while a large proportion of the graphics are almost uninterpretable without explanation.I have been generous in giving this book 3 stars."
1,Dull and boring.,"Not a serious product. Science is not based on consensus but on evidence of rigorous empiric observations, subsequently validated in an independent sample. Pamphlet."
5,An Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore,"This book came to me at top speed in perfect condition, wonderfully packaged. I coulnd't be happier!~"
5,"A ""Must Read"" Book","President Bush and his group of Neanderthals should read this book...on the other hand, it would do no good for them to read it, because (a)they wouldn't believe what they read, or (b)they might believe it, but refuse to acknowledge that belief. The sad fact is that the people who have the most need to educate themselves by reading this book are the least likely to do so."
4,Looks Interesting,I looked through the book and was pleased to see so many picturesof the various subjects. I have not read the whole book yet but I like all of the photos.We heard al Gore speak in Toledo when he and Clinton were on the campaign trail. We were so impressed with his enthusiam.
1,"Al, this book demands a sequel,","maybe something like: ""Global Warming Kept the Chads Hanging"", ""Global Warming & Heat Stroke Made John Kerry Say: I Voted For It Before I voted Against It"", ""A Dummy's Guide To Global Warming By A Dummy"", ""Global Warming is Driving Big Foot Out Of The Mountains To Your Neighborhood"", ""Global Warming Has Caused The Loch Ness Monster To Head For America"", ""My Mother-In-Law's Dog Was Forced To Chose Between Food & Doggie Prescription Medicine By Global Warming"" or ""Global Warming Made Bill Do Bad, Bad Things In The Oval Office"".Might I be so bold as to suggest this waste of paper be placed in the category it belongs in....science fiction."
1,inconvenient indeed,"the only thing inconvenient to Gore is how we all have access to the web, which disproves all of his ""facts"". Yes dozens of scientists back him....and hundreds of scientists don't. Yet it's just the dozens that get the attention of the ""unbiased"" media, and Gore.I was not able to finish this book, so maybe I shouldn't reviewbut just the few ""chapters"" I read, and the rest I scanned, I knew for a FACT to be highly exagerated or just wrong outright.Investigate things yourself, not on blogs where the blind lead the blind but real scientific sites with FACTS. Al Gore is embarrassing and clearly has the same starving ego/need for attention that Clinton has. Did Bush Sr and Quayle hang around for YEARS like these two? No not even months but I digress. Oh and FYI Gore has made millions from various oil company stocks - another easily found fact via public record etc. Anyway who wants a free book? haha do yourself a favor and be intellectually honest and read science, not opinion."
1,Al Gore Must Be Running for President,"Let's see. Al Gore has come out with a book and a movie that seeks to whip up hysteria over global warming, based on suspect junk science, a lot of flashy but misleading graphics, and a solemn tone that's suppose to convey deep concern, but actually suggests the mind of a confidence man who may not have both oars in the water. I guess Gore must be running for President."
1,Robot hard at work.,"This book seems like it was written by twiggy from Buck Rogers. We are taking advice on Global Warming from Al ""747"" Gore. How many thousands of gallons of jet fuel was used in the promotion of this book? Another example of ""Do as I say, not as I do."""
1,Global Warming on Mars,"This book should be titled: An Inconvenient Lie. Scientists have found that Mars is experiencing global warming that is concurrent with earth's cycle. Is this due to Ford Motor Company too? This book is junk science. Or better yet, it is politics that cares little for the truth of science.Caltech scientists have been watching pits on mars, and believe there is a global warming trend happening on Mars.The Caltech scientists state that if both Mars and Earth are experiencing global warming, then there is a greater issue going on in the Solar System that is causing their global climates to change.There has also been 7 notable heating/cooling cycles known to researchers. These heating cycles came on rapidly, and scientific evidence proves this. These included ice ages, and none were caused by mankind. Quite possibly the Flintstones didn't peddle with their feet? A good question for Al Gore."
5,"Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth""","This Work is a MUST READ for every one whether adult or child. It should be required reading for every school in the nation. Gore's ability to explain the problems, associated with global warming in terms that can be easily understood, makes for great reading.The visual explanations, in terms of graphs and photographs, help to make plain what Al is describing about the potential global disaster that is coming at us faster than most of us are willing to admit to. Bravo Al!"
5,An absolute MUST read,"If you are at all interested in the survival of our planet and the effects of climate change, this book provides all the facts in an easy to understand manner. It is the book version of Al Gore's film, so if you can't get to see the film or you just need something to remind you of the frightening statistics, then this is a must. The facts are clear and easy to understand. It also gives an interesting insite into the man himself."
4,How About Our Own Backyard,"I am glad that Al Gore has used his name to highlight this global problem. It's better to be late than never.But all of us including 3rd world don't have resources and are more concerned about our individual health affected by Indoor and Outdoor air pollution and its effects on our health. A collectible book still available on Amazon to handle this problem ""Industrial Leaks and Air Pollution: Causes, Cures and Health concerns"" by Dr. Dhillon is a good start."
1,I believe him...,"I believe him...just like I believed him when he said that he invented the internet. It's an interesting book, I suppose. However, it clashes with others who have more scientific knowledge, therefore I cannot give it much credence."
1,Look to the sun for the earth's climate change,"Almost 100% of the earth's energy is provided by the sun. It can be shown that a small increase in the energy from the sun, consistent with a normal fluctation in the energy output of the sun, will result in a relatively large increase in the earth's average temperature. This is beyond the control of man."
1,The Timeliness of Inconvenience,The line between scientific truth and politically useful scientific truth is easily blurred when the author has a self focused personal agenda. This effort is a disturbing example of how to do this. One can hardly wait for the movie to come out.
1,"Please, Louise","Al Gore is no more qualified to write on the environment than Barbra Streisand. This is someone who flunked out of both divinity school and law school, folks - not to mention that he derives income every single year from a company that leases land from him that has been cited year after year for pollution violations.Hypocrisy. It's like John Kerry writing a book on the simple life."
5,maria freitas brazil,"the book is superior to the DVD because has more information for scholars as myself and a very good text.al, congratulations, ! I met you through thomas lovejoy in one of your trips to the Brazilian Amazon in manaus many years ago. best, maria freitas"
1,Another liberal attempt to revive Gore's political career,"This self-serving political tract is nothing but an obvious attempt to revive All Gore's career. Gore first callously uses the auto accident that nearly killed his son to make us believe that he's not as shallow as he looks. Then, he misuses information from the liberal media to falsely conclude that global warming is an established truth, when in fact it is a theory with as many holes in it as sourdough bread.If you want the other side of the debate, read ""State of Fear"" by Crichton or ""The Deep Hot Biosphere"" by Thomas Gold.If you want to understand Al Gore, read ""The Marketing of Evil: How Radicals, Elitists, and Pseudo-Experts Sell Us Corruption Disguised As Freedom"" by David Kupelian.In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,Father Carlos"
1,An Inconvenient Lie,"This piece of fiction is so full of distortions and outright lies that it boggles the mind. The Aral Sea, Mount Kilimanjaro examples used by Gore are pure fiction. If he believes his examples and truly does not know the scientific and easily obtained truth, then he is just ignorant, if he knows the truth about these examples, then he is just a baldfaced liar."
1,"Buy ""Godless"" Instead","Save your money, I am old enough to remember 1972 when we were going to run out of oil in 10 years. Now in 2006 Exxon tells me we have 5 times as much oil in known reserves as we have used in the last 100 years. For a book that makes sense buy Ann Coulters book. Al Gore is totally wacked out. Also recommended ""Politically Incorrect Guide to Science""."
1,a big lie,"This book presents so much false evidence it isn't even funny. It's terribly one sided. If you really care about the truth you'll research both sides of this topic instead of taking in what the ever so corrupt U.N. dictates as dangerous and irreversible. A good starting point is researching the mideival warming period and the little ice age. That's right folks, global warming is part of the earth's natural cycle and not only is it not going to kill us...it's actually helpful to our environment. I used to believe in global warmign until I did research for a paper. Now I just think Al Gore is an uninformed idiot just looking to find his political niche again."
1,Nonsensical rant by a failed politician that refuses to go away.,"After having his damaged credibility saved by the Supreme Court in the infamous 2000 elections Mr. Gore is back and this time he tackles ""Global Warming"". My first thought when I heard of this was ""There is no limit for Gore's irresponsibility"". Take this for what it is; another attempt by this guy to stay in the limelight.If you want serious information on this very important issue for our future this book will not provide it. Many of the facts are overblown of completely wrong. There are many other resources by real experts of the matter in the form of books or websites.Don't spend your time or money with this hypocrite. While you are trying to be conscious with your surroundings and your environment Mr. Gore is wasting and polluting more in one day with his motorcades and private jet rides than your whole town does in a year."
1,More Eco-socialist Blather,"Gore knows as much about global climate change as he did about inventing the Internet. I bought this book hoping to read about the real, scientific causes of global warming; namely, sunspot activity (except in some parts of the world, where we are experiencing global cooling). Instead, all I got was blame on humans for existing and the typical left-wing eco-extremism. The bottom line is this: if mankind cannot fix global warming, then how in the heck can they be blamed for causing it? Gore is an idiot."
1,Modern day alchemy,"Where to stop? Warmed over out of context statistics, invective, hysteria and hyperbole. For a lousy, dreary, frantic fantasy read, this is your book. If Amazon allowed minus stars this would rate a minus 2. I borrowed a copy for a friend and can truly say it's best use would be barbeque fire starter."
1,An Inconvenient Truth by Al gore was disappointing,"I found the book less full of facts and more full of computer generated what-ifs and pictures of young Al and his wife hiking, etc. It failed to point out that the same things that are being said today have been headlines in Time magazine and others in the 70's and other times in the past and that this global warming fear is cyclical if one is to look at history. It also failed to point out the impact of non-man-made events on global warming. I thought the pictures were pretty."
1,China a role model on pollution control?,"I recently got back from a trip to China. I saw a half dozen cities and what was most remarkable about all of them was the pollution. It was like nothing I had ever seen, and I live in New York City which is supposedly the most polluted city in the United States. The pollution in China is so thick you can taste it. So I was shocked when I got to the part of this book where Mr. Gore praises China's environmental record and claims that they're on the ""cutting edge"" of environmental technology. That was too much. Mr Gore uses the word ""truth"" in the title of his book but I think he's being about as truthful as when he claimed that the main characters in ""Love Story"" were based on Tipper and himself."
2,Lots of pretty pictures,"not worth reading, but well worth looking at. I spent plenty of time staring at the cool pictures - but it did not motivate me to do anything about the world, except say there at some cool places to take pictures."
1,Wrong Subject,"What is this book doing in the listings for Meteorology? It needs to be moved to the Fictiona section along with all the other bs global warming propoganda. People, global warming is nothing more than a peak in the natural sine pattern of Earths climate... get a clue and a new cause."
1,Proven wrong by British court in eleven instances,What else is there to say.We've been played.And it's cost us.And how much richer is Al Gore and his pals in more ways than just book royalties?
4,A laudable attempt to graphically tell a story,"Mixed with a good dose of autobiography and motivated in part by the dramatic events in the life of the author, this is a nice and easy to read documentary that might or not be as devastating as depicted, but for whatever reason should be taken seriously. The real problem is, that all possible solutions are very difficult to achieve and linked to many important and demanding socio-economic and political developments."
5,Excellent Quality,"This tray is attractive, functional and high quality. I can use it as a serving tray and also as a serving platter for appetizers. It is NOT lightweight or flimsy and should last us a lifetime of entertaining family and friends."
2,"Fran Jeffries Sang ""It had Better be Tonight"" in the film","Actually, that was Fran Jeffries who sang that version of ""It Had Better be Tonight"" in the film. She played the role of the ""Greek"" Cousin. Visit this link for an excellent biography and discography:http://www.swinginchicks.com/workinitfordaddy.htmIt received a lot of top 40 radio play after the film release. Don't know why it has not appeared on any of the compilations."
5,Great Example of Mancini's Capabilities,"""Smooth"" is a great way to describe this CD. If its raining/cold outside, and you have friends inside, play the CD. Everyone will immediately get hooked on the almost ubiquitous first title, ""The Pink Panther Theme"". From there get ready to experience a mellow trip down various snazzy tracks with a European/Latin beat that adds some kick to the tunes, but always in balance with the strings and other instrumentals. The one exception is ""Shades of Sennett"" which sounds like a carnival tune - and is thankfully brief. Overall, an excellent CD."
5,Eternal album,This is one of the most important music albuns ever made. Henry Mancini was a genius that left us a wonderful work. It don't seems to be a soundtrack album and all the songs are very beautiful.
1,Warning ! This is not the original sound track !!,"Bear in mind this is not the original Pink Panther sound track, even though they deceptively make it look as if it is. I purchased this CD specifically for the number Claudia Cardinale sings, but to my great disappointment her song is not included and they substitute the corny instrumental in it's place. I feel cheated, and believe they should make it clear that this CD may not contain the tracks one may be looking for..."
5,a read-aloud to the family book,"I got out all the maps of the Inland Passage along the British Columbia coast to follow each adventure this articulate widow with five imaginative and curious children and one dog discovered. Her tales of their explorations in a small boat and descriptions of wonderful scenery climaxes in the longest selection near the end of the book: ""A Whale...Named Henry [18 pages], the just pleads to be translated into a Newberry Award children's book!"
5,"I know the story well, the author is my grandmother",I've read the the book many times and never tire of it. My father was one of the five children:Peter. I was only 5 or 6 when Capi died but I can still remember her. She was a very'matter of fact' woman. My dad was able to relate many other stories and expand on the ones in the book. When he grew up he sailed up and down the coast. Only 1 of the 5 children remain alive today and she ( Joan) resides in Victoria.
5,The Curve of Time,"This is a great historical perspective on boating in the Canadian Gulf Islands and beyond, of particular interest to modern day boaters. In addition it provides a diary of how one woman provided adventure and a unique learning experience for her children. I found it compelling. The only detraction was the rather abrupt ending."
5,"A lovely, lyrical book","This book is beautifully written, full of vivid imagery of the stark and wild beauty of the northwest, and equally full of one woman's spirit and love for her family. It is a book I will turn to again and again."
3,"TheCurve of Time"" The Classic Memoir of a Woman and Her Children Who Explored the Coastal Waters of the Pacific Northwest","Our book group selected this book to read. The beginning two chapters were promising, however, the ""story"" just repeated and repeated. I did finish the book by approaching it as a school assignment."
5,Most wonderful read,"This lady had Stuff! To take on the waters of the PAC North West is no easy task, let alone doing it alone, so to speak. The telling of her experiences shared with her children is breathtaking at times. This is a book to trigger dreams of adventure which hopefully lead to fulfillment."
4,excellent training tool!,"very pleased with the results from utilizing this training tool. My 8 y/o son was in a hitting slump (0 for 9 with 8 k's) off the pitching machine. After 4-5 practice sessions on the Louisville Slugger Instructo Swing Tee he is batting 8 for 12. The tee works well to teach kids how to hit level. My son was performing a golf swing prior to using the tee (I also had him change his Wii remote swing when playing ""The Bigs 2"" which I felt was contributing to his change in mechanics).I also feel that it works well in teaching proper hip motion! Great purchase, wish I had done it with my older child instead of the Hurricane."
4,"Reviewing the CD,""Goin South by Various Artists""",This has to be one of the best compelation cd's of southern rock that you can buy.It's worth every penny and more.I'm really happy I bought it.
2,Bad music.,"This is the armpit of American music. The only good things on this cd are ""Ramblin Man"" and the woman on the cover."
2,Great collection of songs but poor quality.,"Goin' South has a great collection of songs. If you read the list of songs and love this kind of music this is a great CD for you. I love every song on this CD so I snapped up a copy right away. But when I got it home and listened to it I was so disappointed at the production quality. It sounds like they dubbed all these classic rock songs right off an 8-track player. It was so bad I started adjusting the knobs on my stereo thinking something had broken! I switched to another CD just to compare and verified the problem is in the recording. Also, they package this in a cheaper than usual jewel case there is no inside jacket and the cover is printed on cheap paper. I would expect this if it were a... bargain bin special but not at this price!"
3,Plextor DIGITAL VIDEO CONVERTER ( PX-M401U/SW,THIS MACHINE MIGHT WORK OK IF PLEXTOR WOULD GET THE RIGHT SOFTWARE FOR IT BECAUSE IT STINKS. I COULD NEVER GET IT TO WORK RIGHT AND THIS IS AFTER I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH PLEXTOR FOR AROUND 10 TO 15 HOURS FOR THREE DAY PLUS MANY EMAIL BACK AND FORWARD TO THEM. STAY AWAY AND GET A GOOD TV CARD.
3,"Good book, but not as useful as newer guides","This book has good descriptions and pictures of the birds of Europe, with very nice color plates. There are arrows that point to key plumage differences among species to make identifications easier. Unlike more modern guidebooks, the book has a few disadvantages, including maps that show only presence of birds in geographical areas, and not seasons or migration routes, and the inconvenience of having to go to three different places to find the illustration of the bird, the description, and the map. It would have been so much easier to use if the three were together."
4,Get BIRDS OF BRITAIN AND EUROPE,"Mostly up to usual high standard of Roger Torrey Peterson. I found it very useful in Sweden and Norway this past month. North American bird fans will enjoy the plates to facilitate identification, maps showing where a species is to be found, and description of species, subspecies, and habitats. I carried it everywhere, since even common birds in Scandinavia are not common to me!"
1,Worst singer/songwriter I've ever heard!,"Is it possible to give negative stars? Sorry....I can't really even give 1 legitimate star....it's awful! Ok, maybe I'll pay 10 cents, since the ""Naked Dutch Painter"" is a catchy name. But...next, please."
5,Feedback,"Hello, I give the item a 5 star review. I was very delighted when I received the merchandise. I have recommended to all my friends. Thanks"
2,"lot's of info, little insight, nothing quantitative","""Secrets of.."" reflects a lot of work by the four authors.Unfortunately a lot of information is repeated throughout several chapters, which make reading the book from front to end a bit strenuous.While the collection of data is impressive and the message is clear, the book lacks what I expected from it: a quantitative yardstick to evaluate the players in the software products market and the software service companies."
3,I expect better content from McKinsey folks..,"Overall this is an adequate book for the title. However, coming from McKinsey folks, then...... hmmm.... The writing is a little sloppy and some of the analysis are not really insights. There ought to be more daring predictions at the end of the book from the authors... I suggest the authors to create an updated edition NOW since things are changing so much so fast in the software industry."
4,good insights into why software fails,A must read for everyone who is interested to find real life examples of successful software companies as well as those who failed. I especally enjoyed reading the chapter where it explains why projects fail at such high percentage.
3,Loved it but it broke,"Broke in the first 2 months! The cover is nice in neoprene, clips on belt, unsnaps in a second to take a call! loved it until it broke :( ! But i'm kind of hard on my phones, always smacking it into something (door,chair,wall,etc). I still keep my phone in the case. It's the clip on the phone case that broke, not the part that goes on your belt. If they would put a zipper on the top of it you could slide a new clip back in it and use it again? Only a thought! if your careful with your phone it is a GREAT case for the money! Better then sticking that two sided tape bracket to it! hope this helps!!!!!!!!!"
1,"How is this an ""album""???","Am I missing something here? There are a total of 3 ... THREE ... songs on this (so-called) album!?! OK, technically, I guess an album is a collection of 2 or more songs but I mean .. COME ON .. that's not the classic definition .. or expectation .. of a music album.THIS IS NOT WORTH THE PRICE! .. even at the MP3 download sale price of $2.99 you only save 28 cents over purchasing the 3 individual songs."
5,romeo & juliet in L.A.,"I know, I know....another 80's gang movie but this one has some of the best actors around. James Spader, Robert Downey, (without the jr.) Kim Richards from all those kids movies is all grown up. Plus, an appearance by one of the coolest bands, Jack Mack & the Heart Attack. They almost steal the show! I highly recomend it to anyone who was around in the 80's. Lets not forget Jim Carroll, just Too Cool. It is a lot uf fun and has lots of action, too."
5,Tuff Turf - VHS,"This is an excellent movie and I recommended it because it is the only know time you're going to see Kim Richards' breasts. I personally have a friend who was part of the production company and the ""breast"" scene was shot both by Kim and a body double. She made the decision at the very end not to use the double, so those are her breasts you're are looking at. Keep in mind that it's the only revealing scene she has - and is very brief. The dance sequence she does is excellent and was included as part of an MTV video. Tuff Turf aired on cable many many years ago and is a must own for any Kim Richards fan."
5,ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF THE 80'S,"This movie is so awesome. It's one of the best.Tuff Turf has a great cast, great acting, cool music, great fight scenes, and of course shows James Spader in his best movie moment when he sings to Kim Richards! Ahhh!!!James Spader is fantastic in this movie, and he looks hot even when he's beat up.Kim Richards is so hot and her long hair realy defines her character!Robert Downey Jr. Comon!!!He's awesome!!!And of course Jack Mack and the Heart Attack comon putting them in your movie is pure genius!If you have never seen this movie...you are deprived.If you don't own this movie...you are missing out on a great movie gem.GREAT, FANTASTIC, AWESOME. I GIVE IT 5 STARS!!!"
2,Oh so mediocre,"I find it difficult to feel strongly about this film one way or the other because there just isn't much there. Newcomer and rich kid James Spader moves to a new town, pretends he's a rebel and quickly makes enemies with the local high school hoodlums. Being too darn smart for his own good, he falls for Lead Hoodlum's best girl. Lo and behold, she dreams of a better life and likes him right back, but is too afraid of Lead Hoodlum to trade up. Yawn. Spader's faux bad boy act wears thin very quickly and the cheese oozes rather heavily, though Kim Richards (aka Paris Hilton's aunt) is awfully cute and offers the film's only redeeming value. Whether or not one watches depends on one's desire to see Kim."
5,One of the best 80's movies ever!!,Tuff Turf is one of my favorite movies of all time. I'm in my late 30's so when I watch this movie it makes me have the feelings that I had when I was a teenager. I'm so happy that it is on DVD now I am waiting for my copy now. I can't wait to watch it with my own children. I highly recommend this movie!
5,My Tuff Turf,I watched this movie one time several years ago. It just stayed with me until now when I found it to purchase. I had remembered young James Spader's performance but could not remember the female lead. I still haven't figured out why I forgot Kim Richards who was outstanding in the role. A young Robert Downy steals scenes as he still does today with his talent. The best part of the movie is the music. Filming music performers at their best saves them and their music for posterity. I loved this movie!
4,"A modern day ""Grease""","A Grease storyline with modern day setting (in which gangs weren't as ""nice"" as they used to be). I happened upon this movie by chance about 13 years ago and I have seen it at least 20 times since. The music in this film is excellent. A must have for those still collecting VHS. Definitely worth the price!"
3,never got it,"I never received the movie. I contacted the seller and they determined it was ""lost in the mail"" and refunded my money. I asked if they couldn't reship the movie but they said they didn't have it in stock anymore. They were prompt with their replies, but I found it strange that they didn't have another copy to send me. I have seen the movie before, just wanted to add it to my library."
2,"Comme ci, comme ca","I actually saw this in the theater when it was first released and haven't seen it since. I started laughing at stuff that wasn't supposed to be funny, especially when Spader serenades Kim Richards.Robert Downey Jr. and Jim Carroll sure were cool, though."
5,I loved it!,"My husband has been looking for this movie for years for me too see. I finally found it on DVD at a very reasonable price, and it was mailed directly to my house! So I didn't have to deal with holiday crowds and lines. He was so surprised on Christmas, it was great."
5,Classic....,"Reminds me of my youth. How can you go wrong with that?! James is at his best, and the music!!!"
1,Crap,"Speaker looked decent, didnt hit very hard in a sealed small box and had to turn my 800 watt amp to only 1/4 cause the speaker was flexing too much. Tried breaking it in for a week at very low volume. It disnt handle much at all and blew in two weeks. Crap!"
5,Wonderful book,"This is a very thorough book regarding Quaker theology. It reviews original beliefs and current Quaker beliefs. It is organized by topic, such as: sin, God, Church, etc. It is also very understandable. I recommend this for any new or old Quaker."
2,Disappointed,"This book had lots of potential. Great plot line but the author never really moved anywhere with it. Two girls fall in love at 16. Quickly, we flash-forward 6 years and Zinna has unexpectedly left the love of her life to pursue her own dreams of becoming a great artist. That's it - this goes on for 238 dull pages. Zinna pines away for over a year for Megan who pines away for Zinna. We hear the same phone calls being endlessly repeated but we never see our 2 girls together until the last page of the book. Glad I didn't pay full-price for this dud."
3,Not what I expected...,"Teh towels ar as good as any towel, but the Vikings logo doesn't look very resistant and also it doesn't say VIKINGS, it's just the logo on both towels"
4,Picard the diplomat to the rescue!,"Better than average Picard ""stops the war"" novel.Add it halfway down your to read list."
3,Average trek adventure,"I found this to be an average diplomatic adventure. The background story was fascinating, but not given enouh depth. Some things were implausible given what we were told about the technological level of the races. There were some inconsistencies through the story, as if the writer forgot something that had been established earlier. I also thought some of the dialog was too 20th century and didn't always fit with the characters. I also felt the ending was rushed and incomplete. For the story alone I would recommend this."
3,Good Star Trek TNG entertainment,"""The Last Stand"" reads just like a Star Trek TNG episode, and that is praise, not criticism, because I truly liked Star Trek, The Next Generation.This is the story whereby the Enterprise stumbles upon two pre-warp civilizations that are about to engage in interplanetary war. Most of the basic premises of the plot were reasonable with (in my opinion) one glaring exception -- I just couldn't quite buy the Krann and their whole multi-billion person space fleet concept. Also, it seemed unlikely that the Krann would develop a cloaking device of the sophistication set forth in the story. But once one suspends one's critical facilities on these points the novel becomes a real pleasure, because it is well-written and an enjoyable read.Star Trek TNG fans will enjoy this novel. I did."
2,There are 20 charts with separate outline charts.,"Designs of butterfiles in this book are suited for beginning counted cross stitch. There are 20 black and white charts with separate outline charts. There are few color images, but all of the butterflies have the Latin name and many have the common name. The charts are concise and easy to follow. Instructions are good for beginning stitchers and there is an embroidery cotton floss conversion chart."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money on this book. The title is appealing but once you get through the first few chapters (if you can even make it that far), you will realize that it's written at an elementary level. I was hoping for a step-by-step guide and framework but it's hardly anthing like that at all. Additionally, it references to businesses/management in Nigeria which is unhelpful for those who are looking for direction in opening a business in the U.S."
2,Not What I Hoped It Would Be,"This book didn't measure up to my expectations, I thought it would have nicer designs and more variety. I haven't looked through it again since the day I bought it. I packed it away along with the other design book I bought from this company."
4,Strong!,"This is really a rugged piece of equipment. I used this tool when helping a friend to build several dwelling units. He used this tool very roughly. He would just throw it on the floor, mud, or grass. One time he even accidently dropped from the top of the roof. Very strong tool for its power. My only complaint is its price. I have a 14.4 Porter Cable drill driver with hammer mode for about the same price. PC delivers 330 lbs. of torque/inch. which is much higher than this Makita's. But this is a tool built to last. Battery charger and the batteries also will last many years. For performance and durability I would have given five stars but because of the price I am giving it only 4."
2,Worthless After 12 months!,After about 12 months of very light use (maybe once a month on average) my 14.4V Makita's drive no longer engages and I can stop the rotation just by slightly gripping the keyless chuck. I suppose I may have just got a lemon but since its the only Makita I've ever owned I can't compare it to any other Makita products.
4,BUY ONE!!!,"A must-have for the videographer who wants more control over their shots. This is a no brainer if you have the cash. Yes, its a little spendy but well worth the money."
1,I love MTB ... this is NOT good.,"I have nothing against a good band carrying on even after it has lost some of its members - I still love Lynyrd Skynyrd, for example.Sadly (and unlike the current Skynyrd line up), the current Marshall Tucker Band isn't worth the trouble on dvd or in concert.This DVD was terribly disappointing. I was hoping to find some great old concert footage. Instead, the ""Then"" is thin and the ""Now"" is noxious.If you're expecting to be treated with healthy doses of the great Tommy and Toy Caldwell, you're out of luck with this DVD. On the other hand, if you want a good example of absolutely [not good], buy this."
1,Shameful,"I can not believe that Doug & Jerry would trash Toy & Tommy to promote themselfs. We all kown Toy & Tommy where the hearts and souls of MTB. This DVD is about Doug, Jerry and the new band and not the great early days of MTB, it has only one song with Toy & Tommy on stage. (...) I wish someone would produce a DVD dedicated to the original band. MTB was the greatest band to come out of the south and it was Toy & Tommy that made it so, not Doug & Jerry. (...)"
2,A Sad Afterthought,"This is a very sad retrospective. Wait for something that is true Marshall Tucker Band on DVD, or buy the greatest hits CD. This DVD is a waste of money."
4,haven't actually heard the single but saw them live,"i saw cracatilla in cambridge in some crappy little bar and thought they were awesome. they had a cool sound that didn't sound exactly like everyone else. they were upbeat without being too poppy. for a band i'd never heard before that night, i was really into them."
3,bossa nova lounge,"Individual songs here are refreshing in that they are not the same 20 bossa nova classics we've been hearing for the last 40 years, however, as a collection this album feels really light. OK, for bubble-gum background music; not great for serious listening."
4,Great Music!,"This CD is just what we were looking for for our wedding ceremony. It has all the classics, but it's all in acoustic guitar. The artist is amazing. It sounds wonderful, and it's more relaxed than usual classical music. It will be perfect for our outdoor wedding."
5,Fun and sweet,"This is a nice story. Monroe wants to know what art is all about so he asks his Mom. The book is a conversation between Monroe and his mom. All the while a ""Garfield type"" cat is making funny commentaries about what is happening. It is an informative and fun read."
3,too little richard diamond score,"A couple of Richard Diamond soundtrack numbers on the label were NOT on the CD. Further, poor choice of pairing for the ""other"" jazz score."
2,OK if you never change a setting,"You need a Ph.D. in quantum physics to figure out how to program this thing, and that's AFTER you have the manual (which you'd better not lose, because the company no longer stocks them for replacements). There is absolutely nothing intuitive about the buttons and the programming. Once the alarm is set, watch out, because it will stay set that way until you master the bizarre rituals of changing it. Good luck, you'll need it.Other than that, it looks nice (so long as you're not in direct sunlight, when it looks like a jigsaw puzzle), and it keeps good time."
4,True artist; enduring works,"How easy to fit in, how challenging to do your own thing when it flies in the face of cultural mandates. Crawford was visionary and courageous and I love celebrating her life and music. She refused to succumb to the atonal fascists and said: music is head and heart, don't put unnecessary yokes on a composer. So, she used dissonance and atonality well, but never became one of the boys, never became a slave to style. She wrote good music and waited for the world to get ready to accept it. She paid a price (how many music buildings on campuses are named after her?) But she left us some great work and a blueprint for what a real artist does and how he/she can live their lives fully and sincerely."
3,Old Chinatown,Was looking forward to reading more about on early NYC chinatown and more photos of familiar streets. Was disappointed.
3,Product was OK,"I have very frizzy hair. My hair is naturally straight (very slight wave) & oily. I live in a sub-tropical humid climate that contributes to the frizz. (FYI-I have long length blonde hair) I am always looking to improve my hair's unruly behavior without having to constantly use hairspray,gel, or other hair styling products. If I could find one great product to control a lot of the frizz without weighing it down or making it look like an oil slick then I would be a happy camper. This spray smells awesome but just seems to do an OK job. From my own experience, the price I paid for the results was not worth it. However, I like the Sexy Hair brand; I guess that's why I was hoping this product would deliver. If at all possible to try the product out before purchasing, I would suggest to do so."
5,Great product,I like the way this product works when I straighten my hair. It smells good and I received it sooner than I expected. I definitely recommend this product!
5,AWESOME PRODUCT,"I absolutely love this product!! It works so well. I have course, naturally curly/wavy hair and my hair is so soft and straight with this product. Make sure you don't use too much or spray too close to your hair or it will make it greasy. My hair stays straight for days! Why did I just now discover this product?? I've needed it my whole life! I will never straighten my hair without it ever again. It seriously cuts the straightening time in HALF!"
3,A-OK,"This product works fine but it did not have the wow factor that I was expecting after reading some of the reviews. I have very curly hair and I use it to protect my hair when I straighten it. Though it is protecting my hair, it doesn't really enhance the look of my hair or make my hair last longer than any other product would. Next time I will just save my money and buy a simple $5 bottle of something that does the exact same thing."
3,Love this Stuff,"I just ordered 2 of these and for the life of me I can't figure out why the caps had been removed before shipping. So the cans arrived just fine, but without tops, so there's no way to pack one for travel, but I guess that's OK."
4,My hair isn't totally tamed,"I still get mildly frizzy hair and the spray makes me cough. I have to hold my breath and shut my eyes when applying because the heavy aroma kills me. It smells like a salon which I can't knock, but up my nose it feels like I'm inhaling pepper spray. It's a very thin and long bottle, so it's not recommended for portability use. Other than that, this product comes in handy and I can't leave the house without giving it a spray."
5,This is one of My favorite Figaros!,"There are many Figaro recordings around there. Because this opera is so wonderful that many conductors and singers want to sing it or perform it. So it's very difficult to choose the only one best recording. This Bohm's recording is made at 1968, but this one is very wonderful one, even there are many recordings conducted by today's conductors. If you want to hear the elegant ""Figaro"", this one for you. The letter duet sung by Countess and Susanna is used a film. (I forgot the title, sorry!) Speaking of the recent recording, I'd like to recommend Abbado's one. Because the cast is superb: Cecilia Bartoli, Sylvia McNair, and Cheryl Studer, Andrea Rost, etc."
3,"Wonderful music, but I'm not sure I like the interpretation","Janacek is one of my favorite composers; I am currently learning ""On the Overgrown Path"" on the piano. I bought this CD based on the glowing reviews on this site.I myself don't much care for Firkusny's style. I am only a student. More importantly, I think, I am an American; perhaps I'm too ignorant of Czech style to appreciate the interpretation. That said, I want more clarity. I want the rubato to be more overt. I love the music, but I want it to be more overwhelming---I really like the Guarneri Quartet's interpretation of the string quartets.I'd be interested in hearing Schiff's interpretation of this music; I'm not sure I'd recommend Firkusny unless you are a scholar or a true devotee of Czech style."
2,C-minus on a five-point scale,"Buy this book and you will lose your maney, check it from a library and you will lose your time. The book is OK for undergraduates, but if you really want to learn anything about institutional sociology, chech out the works of Oliver Williamson, James March, or Michael Hannan."
1,If I ever get my OVERNIGHT order I will let you know,It is hard to rate a product that Amazon can not seem to ship even though I have been charged for overnight shipping.
3,We Are the World,"Like many publications spearheaded by Art Spiegelman and Raw Graphics, Narrative Corpse has great presentation. The large format and ""tabbed"" pages add a nice elegance to this ""jam"" comic. It's a real treat to see so many artists contributing a few panels to a single storyline. Unfortunately the story itself doesn't hold up but I guess that's to be expected in a project like this."
3,"Akers doesn't do the ""Adam's Letters"" justice","Unfortunatly, Akers has spent a fair amount of time depicting Abigail Adams in a Demigog light. Although this was the first biography to be published after the ""letters"" were made public, the volume barely gets off of the ground when it crashes in the political plights surrounding John and the newly formed Union. A fair read, suitable for High School at best."
2,An altogether injustice to Abigail Adams,"Akers is limited by the series he is writing for so very little can be blamed on him, in fact he does a good job with what little he is allotted but his use of her first name throughout is not only taboo for historians but could also be considered sexist -- would you call Thomas Jefferson, ""Tom"" in a biography? Also, major figures in Adams' life have merely the depth of cardboard cutouts. Possibly suitable for the high school freshmen, probably not undergraduate and certainly not for the graduate level."
3,Great recording if you like a slow adagio,These are fully committed performances and unlike one or two others I cannot fault the recording quality. My major problem with it is perhaps a matter of taste; I am accustomed to the Adagio in no. 3 being solemn but flowing; at the slow speed Karajan takes it sounds somewhat ponderous and a little too Tuetonic to me. This may simply be my problem for having grown up with a pacier slow movement but I can't help it. Those who don't have a problem with this should love the disc.
5,Good Mendelssohn and Karajan,"These symphonies find Karajan in a positive mood. Even thirty years later, they still sound new and give pleasure. Both works have been lucky on record, so there is little reason to recommend this CD over those by Abbado, Solti, Blomstedt, or Maag. But it is good Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic play exceptionally well - a safe buy."
3,One of the greatest works...in average recording quality,"This CD would have received 5 stars if the recording quality was good. Noise floor is noticeably high. sometimes the sound is a bit muddled. Karajan's performance though, makes you forget everything and enjoy the music."
2,awful way to treat music...,Marianne Rosenberg has cult-status in Germany that was first given from the GayScene. Her old hits are re-made hear with a somehow stupid techno-house sound which ruins the music. Spent your money for ORIGINALS here at amazon not that thing.
4,Great 5.0 cu. ft. + Refrigerator/Freezer,"I searched extensively for a Refrigerator/Freezer, bigger than 5 cubic feet, that I could afford...& finally found this one. I've used mine now for over 6 months, & it has given me Great Service. I've had other smaller Mini Rrfrigerators in the past, this is the Best One so far. Positives: No Pop Can Chute; Salad Crisper Drawer, & Cubic Feet/Size. Negatives: Some Fresh Vegetables left in the Crisper Drawer can collect Moisture after 2 Days leading to Spoilage; No Door Shelf wide enough to store a Gallon Milk or Juice. I recommend this Great Refrigerator/Freezer."
2,It was junk,I am very disappointed with this item. The box it came in looked nice but once I opened the box pieces were missing and the size did not work for under my kitchen cabinets.
5,Dramatic performance of the Passion according to St. John,"What characterizes this performance is drama and tension. There is no need to be concerned with performance practice here. Conrfomity with the edition and time no doubt had its influence. However, the decisions produced a historically smart performance, albeit with modern instruments and a scaled down choir and orchestra for that day. Richter was a hero paving the way for historic performance practice, although he didn't care for period instruments. The result is thrilling. The choral textures are beautifully and skilfully woven, warm when necessary, sinewy and terse when required. The prcision is remarkable. If I remember, from my LP detail, there were 60 in the choir and 45 in the orchestra.The tenor narative is caringly sung by Enrst Haefliger, one of the best. As a musician and a Christian, I highy recommend this recording. It is a testament of faith."
1,are these refurbs?,"The first one I got was used. I must be on Amazon's 'send used items if you have them' list because I've returned 4 things this year because they arrived used. Anyway, the next one I got also had saw dust on it, however, it was not scratched up and the sand paper was new. Are these recurbs? They look like it with their cheap twist ties for the cord and saw dust on them. frustrating ... anyway not buying tools from here anymore."
2,Item was used,I rec'd this item today and opened the box to find that it has been used. There was sawdust in the box and the belt was on the sander and had clearly been used. Called Makita and they said the belt should be separate in the box (NOT on the sander) and should not be used. Returning item. This should never have been reboxed and resold as it was obviously used and not new.
3,revised -- it's better than I realized,"I am revising my previous review in which I rated this negatively primarily because it seemed like this was a refurbished tool. I should have had more faith in Amazon than I did -- what appears to be a refurb is just a somewhat rustically finished tool. I bought the same unit for a little more money from a local big box store and had the same experience as with the unit from Amazon. The problems I was having can be attributable to a slightly out of alignment adjustment screw. Once I unscrewed it all the way and then screwed it back in the tracking problems went away. It seems to be a pretty good sander, if a bit heavy."
4,Good Stuff,"Works, just like it is supposed to work... Looks good, and I am impressed with the dust bag; it actually works!"
4,ADAPTED TO SHOP VAC,THIS IS GREAT PRODUCT. I WAS ABLE TO FIND AN ADAPTER TO FIT MY SHOP VAC.NOW I CAN DO BIG JOBS AS IN WOOD FLOORS WITHOUT STOPPING. MY ONLY PROBLEMI WISH THE SANDING BELTS WOULD LAST LONGER.
2,"Helpful, but at times out of touch","While reading this book to my children, we found that there were many great ""rules"" of etiquette and manners that really helped to educate all of us! However, the book seemed a little out of touch at times and didn't seem to truly relate to today's world, even though computer and internet etiquette were discussed. Some of the ""what should I do in this situation?"" seemed like an answer from grandma rather than an answer from someone dealing with life today. Manners are timeless, but how you apply them and how you respond is different today than other generations. This book was OK, but I wouldn't read it again or recommend it to a friend."
3,Geared for Older Children,"While its never to early to start good manners, this book seems geared toward the early teens. Maybe I did not read it carefully but I was hoping for a book to help me start with manners in my 3 year old! This is not it."
2,Not That Good,"I seem to be in the minority here, but this album did very little for me. There are a few good songs, but overall I think it is weaker than both ""Constrictor"" and ""Raise Your Fist And Yell""."
5,Cannot understand why this album flopped...,"...as it contains at least five rock-classics (""Love's a loaded gun"", ""Die for you"", ""Feed my Frankenstein"", ""Might as well be on Mars"" and the faboulus ""Burning our bed"") and still's got room for some real great, rockin' songs! This is Alice at his best, if you ask me, and the guitar-playing by guitar-heroes like Slash makes this a must-have for every true fan of rock. Try it!"
5,One of Alices BEST!!!!!!,"I dont care what the old school die hard fans of Alice say about this metal era of songs. This album is a great album. I strongly recomend you buy this album with ""TRASH"" as they really should be a 2 disc album! They both contain some of the greastest hard rockin metal songs i've ever heard. With an all star selection of guest musicions, how could these albums fail? I dont understand why these albums are so cheap to buy? on both those albums you hear a completly amazing onsomble of great musicions ""Stef burns - huewy Lewis & The News"" ""Bon Jovi"" ""Ozzy Osbourne"" ""Joe Satriani"" ""Steve Vai"" ""Nikki Sixx"" and many more.... these albums are absolute metal masterpeices, and if you dont like them, get your head exsamined, if your a rock n roll fan then these albums are a must have! every track, even if you dont like them at first, give them a few listens and they will grow on you till you love them!"
3,Great look at rear view mirror but lacking in solutions,"Honestly, I didn't expect the author to come up with great ideas on how to make Capitalism better but I find it hard to complain about facts yet not really give any concrete ideas on how to make it better. I thought the book was interesting and somewhat sad was his stats about income inequality and the lack of growth in the world. He hardly went into the ""whys"" though. I really was disappointed in the fact that there weren't too many suggestions on how to improve capitalism but again, wasn't expecting many either since it's a pretty good system already."
5,Amazing and Fascinating Book !!,"read capter 11 "" economic Instability "" , you would have escaped from being hit badly by 1997 "" Asian Financial Crisis ""....."
4,Ruthless and objective,"Mr. Thurow has explained, in a neoliberal way, at least, the problems ahead; capitalism had worked, and will continue to work; that is not the point; the point is SPEED, because all developed countries are, in one way or another, slowing down, and it does not seems to be a fast method to ""jumpstart"" them again, because all the ""glory"" of consumption has reached a limit, and such limit appears unbreakable unless some mayor measures are taken; unfortunately, in the political short-term sense, these measures are not quite popular, but they will work in some way in the mid and long terms. Contradictions in the system COULD be very dangerous, as the author pointed out. His main critic is that we know what we have to do is more than just GDP's and consumption, but nobody wants to take any risks."
2,Good,"This is a good book, although Thurow has no interest to hide the fact that he is totally pro-liberalism. Except for an absurd attack to old people in Chapter 5 (blaming them for all deficits in the country )the book has good comments and good research, being written in the ""catastrophic"" style."
2,Pourly Written and Conceived,"""The Future of Capitalism"" is pourly written. Thurow drags a weak metaphor throughout the whole book. His arguments are strong at face value, but anyone with any deep understanding of history and economics can only laugh at them. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
2,How about some value for money,"I paid a c-note for Brion's ""Le Film Noir"" back when a dollar was worth more than a Euro, but for this book? I saw the scintillating reviews (one posted in duplicate) and read it at the AMPAS library, which are the only shelves on which I would ever expect to find a publication from Greenwood (or McFarland or Scarecrow). This ""tome"" (who wrote that review?) is a lot less pretentious than Jon Tuska's ""Dark Cinema,"" Greenwood's foundation noir text; but really, after Foster Hirsch and Silver & Ursini have both weighed in at length on neo-noir, was this book necessary? It is not exceptional if marginally enlightening, so for hard core noir readers only. If you really have a $100 to spare and want to fill out your a noir library, buy Detours & Lost Highways, The Noir Style, a couple of Noir Readers or some other essential book you may be missing and still have enough left over for the Warner Bros Noir Collection."
3,Angel Witch - 'Screamin' N Bleedin' (Metal Nation) 3 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1985,not quite as good as their 1980 self-titled debut.But,still a worthy follow-up.Recently found out this record had never even been put out on CD until this year;I've wondered as to WHY I could never find it listed,anywhere.Ten tracks with three live bonus cuts added makes this a semi-desirable title,perhaps even to new fans.A couple of tunes I found myself playing repeatedly were the title track ""Screamin' N Bleedin'"",""Evil Games"" and ""Fatal Kiss"".Might have an actual bootleg cassette of Kevin Heybourne and crew during their UK tour to support this album.Decent 'New Wave Of British Heavy Metal' effort brought back to life."
2,Not remastered. Transferred from vinyl,It's not remastered. In fact it was transferred from vinyl. You can hear the pops and scratches from the record.Don't waste your money.
2,warpage consistent?,"Of the first 6 balls I received, 3 warped within the first three weeks. The folks at Amazon have been nice enough to replace those three with the promise of replacing the rest if they do the same (They have not been put into use yet.) So far the replacement balls have not warped and seem to be doing well. They are used on a daily basis and are a nice combination of good grip,weight and durability. If they continue to not warp I would raise the score to 4 stars."
3,not the greatest ball,"a bit too rough of a surface for me.i thought it would be a little bit softer but it wasn't, so menus 1 star.menus another star since i never use it since my main ball hasn't yet worn out.over all, not bad.."
3,Not so impressive,"I tried to replace my official jet basketball with this item, and it lacks certain elements I enjoyed with my previous ball. Those elements include grip, microfiber cushion, and overall bounce mechanics. When purchasing this ball, keep in mind that its longevity may be limited, and the Wilson Official Jet Basketball is a better purchase."
2,i don't speak spanish,"i'm sure this is great for a spanish kid and since i can't read spanish i figured it was giving me the american and spanish title. it should be listed as the spanish version. on top of that the place i bought it from""s return policy sucks."
5,A Benchmark Performance,"This reissue from DG features a benchmark performance of the 1st, which sounds so musically fresh and natural in its unexaggerated performance, remastered and now paired with a vigorous male-voice version of the Songs of a Wayfarer, making this disk quite a bargain for the music enthusiast who is just beginning to build up a collection of Mahler's music."
5,Dieskau Does Mahler,"Combine Dieskau with Kubelik and you have a winning proposition! With the clarity and depth of emotion necessary for the music of Mahler, Dieskau brings the texts to life like no one else. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra responds precisely to Kubelik's baton, giving a stirring performance of the Mahler 1st and of the Songs of a Wayfarer. For all Mahler fans, this is a must!"
4,Silicone Pastry Mat,I just received this mat and was so happy to see how large it was. It was the perfect size for my island. But I was very disappointed to find out it slips on my butcher block island surface. I had read all the reviews and was delighted to hear each one say it did not slip on their countertops. So I assumed it would be fine on wood. But unfortunately that is not the case.
4,A good choice,"This item is a bit pricey, but scores an ""Excellent"" in the area of functionality. It doesn't move around while you are using it, cleans up easily, and stores easily due to it's very pliant quality. Top of the line for this type of kitchen equipment."
5,Great pastry mat!,"I think this is a wonderful mat. It stays flat and put, my fondant seems to require less sugar (no I don't use corn starch)to roll out and not stick. Roll it up for storage when it is good and dry and you're good to go. Used a pizza cutter GENTLY to cut off the extra fondant off the cake and had no problems. Finally no more curling corners with cans at each end!"
5,Over all expectations,"I spent over 2 months looking for a non-wallet-braking digital piano and like most people say, i never thought CASIO could be a choice, but i was wrong.the PX-400R is great, the feeling, the sound and even the looks are more than i expected.if you are looking for a great deal, don't hesitate to try this unit, your money will be well spent and your wallet will be happy too.the piano sound is very good, and the keyboard touch is unbelievable.save a lot of time looking for a better deal, there is no better deal for this price range (and even for higer prices) out there, use all the time i have spent on this, you won't regret it.the only thing that i think could be better is the volume in the speakers, but you can always use an Amp and a pair of speakers."
2,Smokin,"I bought this tool 2 days ago and am now returning it. I read the posts that mention it gets hot, but I had no idea how hot. I was simply polishing aluminum and smoke started coming out of this thing. Even before that you had to wear gloves because it was too hot to hold onto. This tool does not work."
4,A fine recording but not the best Die Schopfung.,"The orchestra and chorus are really good but that's all this recording has. This work performed by Solti/Chicago Symphony in 1980s (DECCA, not the 1993's live recording) is more touching. That one is really brilliant."
5,An excellent set. Pollini at his best.,"I am a Pollini fan. I had the luck to hear him live in Athens, Greece, 4 years ago and then I bought these CDs (then available separetely). The Hammerklavier is the best around, that's an apsolute fact. I really like Arrau's account but this one is amazing. The op.111 also belongs to a category of its' own. An overall great set."
5,Unbelievable perfection,"I always have a tendency to follow the printed score of the music I'm listening to(assuming that I have it). When it comes to Beethoven's late piano sonatas and specially this recording, I'm always forced to appreciate the astonishing performance that Mr Pollini has made, once again, in this recording. By far, I haven't found a single note or a single dynamic symbol that Mr Pollini has ignored. It's really the sound that must be heard from all these emotionally complicated masterpieces. I personally don't like it when some interpreters overemphasize some phrases and only take a glance at the others. Mr Pollini never falls into this trap in this recording and I strongly recommend this to anyone that wants to hear the real sound of Beethoven's late legacy."
4,Lost somethign in translation,"I have the original recording on vinyl and the Pines of the Appian Way remix/tranfer disappointed me; the horns near the end seemed a little muted. Otherwise, it's the best recording I've heard."
1,A new look c. 1965 is still same old fantasy today.,"Willian Mandel's views are generally well known to anyone interested in the history of the demise of history's second worst dictatorship, which was responsible for the genocide of millions of innocent people in Eastern Europe. Mr. Mandel was and is one of the Cold War era's misguided Soviet apologists, who even today continue to defend such dictators as Lenin and Stalin, and insist on the validity of the Soviet injustices committed over the years. In his book, written in 1965, and now looked upon as a relic of Soviet misinformation and misrepresentation, Mr. Mandel keeps on trucking for the communist cause, and keeps on insisting that Soviet Union was good for the millions who had to pay with their lives while it existed."
3,Nice Seat Cover,The only complaint I have about this seat cover set is that there is nothing to hold the bottom cover in place. I will have to figure out a tie down system so the bottom cover stays put when entering and exiting the vehicle. Other than that this would be a terrific cover.
4,Just what I expected.,"I just wanted some basic, economical seatcovers to protect my cars' upholstry. Fit is snug & secure. I do wish they had openings in the sides for the seat recliner lever but other than that, I am quite satisfied."
2,The picture is misleading,"Great price, but very low-quality material that is easily snagged... you really do get what you pay for!"
3,Poor fit for low back bucket,These don't look good or fit well for my 97 4Runner. Lots of extra fabric at top and just don't look nice. Still debating whether to ship back or make them work somehow.Wouldn't recommend for low back use. Otherwise they are fairly nice.
3,Here we go again.,Why a expansion to Sim City you ask.In one word money and Electronic Arts has the corner market on making it.Most of the stuff in Rush Hour should of been in the game but they left it out for a expansion.So if you want a better city for your sims then buy it and there might be a patch you will have to wait for.
1,Sadly not cost effective,"Rushhour is CRUCIAL to the satisfactory play of Simcity 4. The game was released as the game, then this Rushhour expansion , then the combination (called SC4 Deluxe). Since the Deluxe version is available in several forms (which include Rushhour) it is just crazy to pay this kind of money for the expansion alone. I don't normally rate things based on cost, but in this case a downgrade is warranted. This rating is for THIS expansion offerYou may want to check out the CD versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition, the downloadable versionSimCity 4 Deluxe Edition [Download] (also available on STEAM) and though most MAC users run it on Windows emulators, the Aspyr versionSim City 4 Deluxe (Mac). It also is included along with several other games in the box setThe SimCity BoxIt makes no sense to buy this version at this $50ish price."
5,Art book for the Himalayan art enthusiast,This is another of Pal's beautifully written books with many lovely paintings included. The quality of the prints is quite good as well.
5,"Best Bach, best Szeryng","Bargain price for the best Bach and the best Szeryng! Szeryng's technique is perfect: his intonation is flawless and his chordal playing is incredible--he can play on four strings at once without making any rough sound!Szeryng was not famous for his tone, which was elegant but rather plain most of the time. But in this DG recording, his tone is unbelievably rich, warm, broad, and beautiful.And what need one say about his interpretation? Szeryng's readings of Bach has long been considered ""authoritative,"" and in Japan perhaps even ""definitive."" He brings out the essence of Bach."
4,Evocative Therapy,"Bach has always been a favorite and Szeryng an inspiration. I was a bit concerned with the Duetsche Grammaphone release, as I have heard many other artistical releases of dubious quality. But this one shines. I understand that Szeryng mastered these works very early in his career, his mastery is evident and haunting. A trip into the past, Szeryng shows his talent. It is such a blessing to be able to hear the masters performing masterworks, especially in the digital format that lends itself to hearing the whole release without interruption. It is most satisfying to retain that sort of connection with the music and the muscian."
3,Typically uneven Walsh album.,"As with most of Joe Walsh's stuff, this CD has some good songs among the mediocre-to-bad ones. ""Two Sides to Every Story"" and ""Ordinary Average Guy"" start things off well. ""The Gamma Goochie"" is silly, but fun and the drumming on ""Look at Us Now"" is fanastic. It also ends strong with the last two tracks. The rest of 'em though, are middle of the road crap, which he always sticks on his CDs. I always thought this guy had a lot of talent as a guitarist and songwriter, and in his solo career spanning the years he has several songs that are good-to-great, it's just that he has never been able to come up with that one great CD."
3,just the average JOE WALSH here,Through the early part of his career with the eagles he's always been the chief rocketeer.Although I grew somewhat tired of Hotel California I never grew tired of Take it to the Limit.I've always enjoyed Joe's earlier stuff up until the album CONFESSOR then I stopped abruptly.Joe needs to stop mixing sound styles and get back to where he belongs.Joe we need a good rock album we don't care if it's accoustic or love balads something!!!!
2,its an ok album...there are two pretty good songs on it,"Ordinary Average Guy and Two Sides To Every Story are pretty good songs but other than that, I was disappointed..Joe was going through hard times but now that he is clean and sober, lets see how he does on his new album that he is working on right now..."
5,"If you only can own 1 album, this may be the one....","I've owned this album since its release, & I'm *still* convinced that it may very well be the best example of singing/songwriting/guitar playing in a contemporary blues setting. Whitley is, in my opinion, one of the most significant contemporary artists & will be undoubtedly be the subject of musicology studies years from now. If you love music, you can't go wrong with either of Whitley's albums. The work is truly inspiring...."
4,Beautiful evocative exciting--and great for traveling!,"You know the scene in ""Thelma and Louise"" with Brad Pitt and Geena Davis? Well, there's a reason the director chose this artist's music to accompany such a hot scene! Slide guitar forever..."
3,"Black, Blue and Convincing","Chris Whitley's singing voice reminds me of Dr. John and Leon Russell. His approach is Black, blue (as in the blues) and from the South someplace near New Orleans. I enjoy him best on the sparse instrumental and tradition blues numbers such as `Make The Dirt Stick' and `Phone Call From Leavenworth.' Living With The Law is generally down-tempo (as it should be), but contains some Rolling Stones-like rockers (Poison Girl) and fully orchestrated Texas girt-and-gravel compositions (Bordertown). The music feels dense and heavy like the air in August in New Orleans. However, there's something distracting about a White guy imitating the voice of a Black singer (especially the falsetto vocals). Is Chris Whitley a ""convincing"" blues composer, guitarist and singer? Yes, most of the time."
1,What is going on?,"I don't know if we are talking about the same album. I am so let down by ""Living With The Law"" that I want to scream. I bought this album based on reviews saying it was his best album. I heard the song ""Big Sky Country"" and love it. The album is so out of tune and like a head ache. It is nothing like ""Big Sky Country"" How are people saying this is the best album. It is not even good. I almost bought his newest album instead because I love the song ""Radar"". I was told that this was his best. What a shame. Please, do not listen to others. This album was so boring. It sounds like someone in his garage was just playing out of tune blues with a loud guitar. Not hypnotic, moving, beautiful music like it was supposed to be. Nothing like Daniel Lanois which was why I bought it. Why? Why did this have to be so bad."
3,The Countess,"The newly widowed Countess Eglantine de Crevy finds that her husband has illegally sold the property given to the couple by her brother. And the purchaser is none other than the man whom she abhorred. Shamed and angered, she gathers up her family and entourage and heads north to a piece of property her husband inherited. In the far Scottish highlands, she arrives at the rundown Kinbeath only to find that it is occupied by Duncan MaClarn. Each is proud and vows not to give up Kinbeath, a bargain is struck and a hand fast marriage of a year and a day takes place. Though Duncan awakens passions, Eglantine vows not to surrender. Duncan has other plans. A must for fans of Claire Delacroix. A light tale of romance that lacks the realism usually provided by background and description. And how does a woman with two children and a few knights and her servants travel from England to Edinburgh than on the far northern Highlands with no finances?"
2,same plot different book,"there are five books to this series, after the first two all the books were the same with little plot change. You have to read this series in order or the story lines go a little crazy. Not as well written as other books I have read in the past (series included). This was my least favorite in the series but in order for the other two books (her daughters) you have to read this book and get through it first. The other books in the series took me less than six hours to read, this book took me more than fifteen hours to read."
1,Format errors ruin the book,"I love this author and I might have enjoyed the book but I was constantly taken out of the story by the format errors. All through the book the left margin would suddenly indent several paragraphs and then return to the correct setting. It was very distracting and really interrupted the flow of the book for me.Consider that this is the book they gave us ""free"" as an inducement to read more of the series! No way!Kindle users deserve better!"
4,Great reading,"I am a big fan of the 3 Marshall and Sanow books. I must say that as an economist I have a good deal of training in statistics, and I'm not sold on the soundness of the math behind the one-stop shot percentages. Marshall seems to be very upfront that these numbers only be used as a relative comparison tool, and I think that this is important to keep in mind. Some might disagree with Marshall and Sanow on method, but I don't believe their work is anything but an honest (and at times successful) effort to save the lives of Americans by providing them with the tools to choose proper defensive ammunition. All three books are excellent. In my opinion the third book is the best and most up to date. While I don't agree with everything in this book it is fairly well written, includes a lot of interesting chapters, and is very enjoyable to read. Keep in mind that even the newest book is nearly 6 years old, and that there are better current ammunition choices in some cases now."
3,"Interesting reading, but lacks detailed substance","I really enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone who is seeking information on handgun stopping power. It has valuable information for choosing handgun ammo. The information contained in the book was good, but it lacks details. There was too much summation in the book for me."
5,Great reporting about a historic campaign,"Doug Wilder is still the only African-American to ever be elected governor of a state. And he did so in a conservative southern state as a Democrat. The foundation for that historic governors race was put in place in the mid 1980s when Doug Wilder ran an upstart, grassroots campaign that shocked the state.This book documents that lieutenant governor's race and does it well.. it can be enjoyed by political junkies and lovers of biographies equally. in fact it is simply a good story that is a good read.There probably needs to be a folllow up book now that Governor Wilder held office for four years, ran a brief presidental race and in his 70s decided to be the first full-time Mayor of crime ridden Richmond, Virginia.This book tells an important story about an interesting campaign."
4,Review of Japanese prints of noted collector,"Displayed in a large-size, high-quality trade paper volume are over 100 prints from the collection of the noted collector Robert O. Muller (d. 2003) which have been bequeathed to the Sackler Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution. Besides the artist, name, and date for each print, there are informative annotations on the career of the artist and the subject and style of the print. Most of the prints are in the 20th-century Japanese style of ""shin-hanga binga,"" whose artists were ""struggling to acknowledge tradition and at the same time transcend it."" Introductory essays cover Muller as an influential collector and place the prints in the context of Japanese artistic traditions. The varied aspects of the text, including a ""Glossary,"" provide a historical overview of Japanese prints as well as a representative catalog of prints from the Muller collection of more than four thousand."
1,US Robotics products,"I bought a U.S.Robotics NAS 8700 a few yrs ago and it finally had a problem,so I called U.S.Robotics for some help and there response was tough luck,we offer no help at all on our older product we make.It seems to me like a company with that attitude towards their older products (not to mention their customers problems) should not be in business.The moral of this story is if you buy a U.S.Robotics product you better beware of what will happen if it breaks.BY-BY DATA. BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU WANT TO STORE YOUR BIRTHDAY ON IT."
3,Not intended for tall kids!,"If I knew then what I know now, I would not have purchased.I too researched, read the reviews, and (thought I) knew what I was looking for. I bought this stroller when my tot was only 18 months. She was already too tall (as many other reviewers noted) for the goofball design of the seatback. Just seems they could have given it a bit more thought and user testing. I would have rated it lower but the stroller is in fact light-weight, easy to fold/use. Although the overall seat design is flimsy, both the back and the legs are adjustable. The bunch of fabric that others refer to is also an annoyance to me, especially when my now 28 month old is napping (though she doesn't seem to care)."
2,Slow show,"Love the actor but the show is convaluted. If someone can't miss one second of your show or they'll miss the plot, you end up getting cancelled, ESPECIALLY ON NBC WHERE THEY CANCELLED HEROES!"
5,Perfect for anyone who shows their dog,This has been a needed item for anyone that shows their dogs in any events. And it is available in 3 different configurations for up to 6 different events. I would recommend to anyone. Even professional Handlers can better keep track of the results for dogs that they show for others.
2,Not a wiggly amazing DVD,"We have about 10 Wiggles DVD's and my 15 month old twins and 3 1/5 year old love them all. I put on this one and was very disappointed. The kids didn't even sit thru 10mnutes of it, and they usually ask to watch their other Wiggles DVD's over and over again. SOng about washing your hands after you go to the bathroom to prevent disease spreading and a song about putting your baby to sleep on their back...REALLY? This was a huge dissapointment and not up to my expectations for the Wiggles."
3,"LOVE the Wiggles, but ....","We were anxiously awaiting this release. We LOVE the Wiggles. However, this dvd is the least favorite of them all. The music and dancing are fun. The days of the week are confusing and since when are they associated with a certain food? Certainly they could have found some more creative and meaningful way to celebrate food. They are the WIGGLES! Also, the introduction of the new Field baby and the song on safe ways for a baby to sleep is totally innappropriate for a preschool video. Since when is this a responsibility of a child or even a child's thought? I do not want my child worrying about Sudden Infant Death. This is an adult concern entirely. We want our fun and silly Wiggles back! Toot-Toot Chugga Chugga!"
3,Very warm,"So this bag is a great, heavy bag that I really like, except I don't think the rating is accurate. It's comparable to my +10 degree F bag. I bought it do some snow-camping with, but that's not going to work out... Although, I haven't tried it. I'm not going to try it with this one. Still, very well-made bag."
5,Excellent,"This is such an important and easy to read book about the dangers of certain food additives that the FDA allows into food without a consumer notice or warning. The long term coverup the FDA has been involved in to favor the giant food manufacturers over vulnerable consumers children, the elderly, etc. is staggering and well detailed. And these additives are in so many prepared foods we wouldn't think to question. Dr. Schwartz's seminal book, in this case the revised edition, needs to be reprinted ASAP!The rise in ADD, Migraines, Seizures, Neurolinguistic processing issues, Autism, Parkinson's, Alzheimers, Breast Cancer, and ALS is linked to food additives that break down into free amino acids that can pass through the blood brain barrier and in some instances promote neuron death. See also Dr. Russel Blaylock's bookExcitotoxins: The Taste That Kills, with a forward by Dr. Schwartz. Both of these physicians are of the highest caliber and their works, precise and beyond important."
3,"My son loves his trains, even without being battery operated","My 3 year old got several of these trains for Christmas. He loves them all. But with all the love he has given them, Gordon and James have stopped being motorized. The thin wires that run between the battery compartment in the tender, to the motor in the engine have broken. Our son still loves to play and talk to his engines and reinact videos, but he now has to make these two engines run around the track himself. The design of Emily is better with the battery and engine both in the tender. With that design there are no exposed tiny wires to get broken.The engines without tenders have all worked great... and their batteries still power them around :-) From our kid testing, James and Gordon train designs are not optimal, Emily is Great she still runs well under her own power.Hope this helps."
4,Strong and compact,"The book is a slender but effective biography of Barney Ross, a boxing champion whose life was a remarkable series of ups and downs. The boxing prose isn't a match for A.J. Liebling, but the author does a good job with the fight material, and he's just as adept in examining other periods in Ross' life (wartime heroism, followed by postwar heroin addiction).There are two notable subtexts in the book - one that involves a search for a bygone world of immigrants and ethnic identification, and the other that deals with the uneasy relationship between the intellectual and the physical among 20th century Jews. That may seem like weighty stuff, but it's not - the author does a solid job of keeping the book constantly readable."
3,deceptive description,"I ordered the geomag 42 Piece glow in the dark set as well as this one (panels). The description states ""84 piece Geomag with Panels"". I assumed I was getting additional magnetic pieces with the panels from the statement ""with Panels"". All that actually comes in this package is the panels. Now I need to order additional magnets so we will have enough to build with. For the amount of magnets and panels that I will have to buy I can't believe these aren't sold in a carrying case. They come in a styrofoam sleeve that won't hold together after it is taken out of the box. I have to wonder if Magnetix would be a better buy for what you get. Quality is fine but it seems you get less for your money. Overall I am disappointed!"
4,Magnetic Creativity,My son (7 yr) has made very creative structures with this kit. If you buy be prepared to add more pieces though and be careful not to loose the small bits. His sister who is 5 is also happy to play with this.
4,Nice cutters,"Very nice cutters, not quite as smooth as my xuron cutters but fairly close to them, I use them on my model railroad work"
5,A must for plastic modelers.,"I highly recommend these cutters for removing the pieces from the sprue. I've used this brand for many years and if cared for properly, they will last for many, many years. These cutters cut flush to the part to reduce the clean-up to minimum."
5,Love it.,"I love this poster, I love the evil series, and what better way to show it then to have this poster hanging on the wall of your office in your house, signed by Ol' Bruce and Sammy adds a nice touch (signatures not included, got them myself.) I would pick this up, poster is nice quality, good sized, and reminds you of the late 70's/early 80's quality."
4,Good statement,"Generally, I don't understand why plastic is so expensive.Plus, so many knock-offs.But, good presentation and brend."
2,It was a nonstory.,"About nothing but not in the Seinfeld way. I must be like Larry and just don't get it. What a struggle to read. Kept it up in hopes something would happen, anything. Never did. Don't recommend."
5,What a book!,"Elizabeth Hartley Winthrop's first novel is a remarkable book. Far from the proverbial autobiographical novel, this is a narrative tightly focused on a single character, who (apparentlly) could not be more different from the young author. And yet Ms. Winthrop gets it astonishingly right: her protagonist, Hollis, is imbued with vivid vitality. His odyseey, at once ordinary and heartbreaking, compels your attention until the very last page. I am already looking forward to Ms. Winthrop's next!"
5,a great pamphlet on monastic life,"""Cistercian Life"" is, for me, one of Thomas Merton's most beautiful works next to ""Seeds of Contemplation"". As Merton says ""This booklet is then a meditation on monasticism in its twentieth century context..."" The booklet is divided into 5 sections- monastic renunciation, the contemplative community, the way of silence, observation and change, and vocation. Each section begins with a quote from the bible or other ancient monastic source. Merton poetically and yet realistically explores these 5 aspects of monastic life in a short but very well done booklet. Here is an excerpt: ""In order to be truly silent, one must get rid of the hankering for recognition, and cease to worry about whether or not one is making the right kind of impression...""For anyone interested in living the monastic life, this booklet can be an invaluable source of inspiration and contemplation."
4,James Joyce: Bard of the Emerald Isles,"To be quite honest, the only reason I picked up this book, was because of its cover which I happened to glance upon while searching through my school library. After I delved into it, I was pleasantly suprised. I though to myself, here was a book written in a slightly arciac style chronicling the adolesence of a nearly forgotten writer that I could still relate to. I suspect the only reason I found it interesting at all was because I like the character in the story was still a young man myself. The way Joyce anaylsizes the times he lives in, and gives philsophical insight, is trully inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who Irish or not, seek a clearer understanding or themselves, and a glimpse into a now forgotten realm of youth and mystery."
5,"If music were a drug, Tift Merritt would be my addiction","Tift Merritt, much like her name, is uncommon, and refreshingly different. A new artist with this much talent doesn't come along that often... this cd is definitely grammy worthy, and she is undiscovered talent! Not only is her voice addictive, her songwriting is thoughtful and deep. I found this in the pop section, but would not put it in that category, or into country for that matter. She has her own sound, but she definitely belongs up there with artists who have groundbreaking talent- Sheryl Crowe, Shelby Lynne, Lucinda Williams and Norah Jones. I recommend this cd to everyone... it is amazing and you just have to listen to it!"
5,Good even if you don't like country,I was a bit uncertain about buying this one because I really despise most country type music. Fortunately she stays on the pop/folk side of the line and I found out that I LOVE this album! Most albums I buy because I like one song and then discover the rest of it is filler. Not this one. I enjoy every song. It has given me great pleasure. The melodies are sweet and her voice is one of the purest I know. Lyrics are good enough. I eagerly await the rest of her career. Strongly recommended.
5,WOW!,"Great debut album.....but even BETTER LIVE! I first heard about Tift on the radio, curious, I bought the album. Quite impressive. Her voice is POWERFUL, but not overwhelming. Full range of songs....slow to ""rock-a-billy"". I would recommend this album to friends..... If you get a chance to see her live......your in for a delightful evening!"
5,RUN QUICKLY BEFORE THEY ARE ALL GONE,"LIVING DOWN SOUTH IN NEW ORLEANS, I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPERIENCE MAY DIFFERENT GENRES OF MUSIC. HOWEVER, TODAY WHILEVISITING A LOCAL MUSIC STORE, I LISTENED TO A SAMPLER CD OF MUSIC FROM THIS CD. I IMMEDIATELY WENT BACK INTO THE STORE AND PURCHASED THIS WONDERFUL CD. I HAVEN'T HEARD A NEW AND FRESH ANGELIC VOICE, SUCH AS TIFTS IN MANY YEARS. TREAT YOURSELF, AND RUN TO YOUR NEAREST MUSIC STORE. YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THIS CD AND LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
3,... it's in her hips...,"... okay, I'm giving this title 3 stars because it doesn't in any fashion approach the vitality of her live shows... but if it gets you to pick it up or go to see her play... well, then good... you should...... the songs are solid, but the album is competely ""slicked out"" and over produced... because she has so much more punch in concert than showcased here... but pick it up... she deserves success and some notoriety...... she makes the east coast and appalachian mountains so much sexier than Sheryl Crow has ever done for California..."
3,"Not too bad, but could be better.","This recording seems to be too timid and not energetic enough. It feels very dragged down. Plus, the most amazing thing about it is missing - the harpsichord solo of the 5th movement. You can't even hear the already passive soloist. My suggestion is that you buy the Jeanne Lamon, Tafelmusik version (even though the 5th concerto in D is really in C#). I believe it is on period instruments and it feels much better to my ears. But it is Bach so don't feel too bad if you buy this version. It is still extremely good."
5,Great for pimples!,"Love this product. It gets rid of pimples in just 2-3 days! It does stink though, but I use it overnight. Worth buying."
2,"Ordered a new one, amazon shipped it used","Looked like a good product, but was clearly used and the belt was worn so I returned it. Amazon won't let you exchange this product, so I ordered another. If it is used as well, I'll be dissapointed. So far I've ordered 3 powertools on Amazon and all have been clearly used, and some missing parts. I'm giving them one last shot. Beware."
5,Thrilled with this sander! Amazing dust collection!,"I needed to resurface a cupped and warped porch deck, a bigger job than my PC rotary sander could handle. I decided on this sander. I initially bought a Ryobi from Home Depot figuring I wouldn't need to use it a lot, but then returned it unopened after I pictured myself using a broken down crappy tool in a couple years. After reading many reviews I decided on this sander. I am really happy I paid $[...] bucks more for a much higher quality tool. Tracking is perfect. Power is very good. DUST COLLECTION IS UNBELIEVABLE! After a few minutes on the porch I realized there wasn't any sawdust, yet the paint was coming up. A few more minutes and I checked the bag...the bag was nearly half full! It captured almost everything! I love this sander! This is one of those tools that you will be happy you spent a little more money on and you will use for many years to come."
4,I Wish I'd Bought It Sooner,"This is my first belt sander and I bought it because I needed to refinish some walnut paneling. It makes stripping old finishes a breeze! I've even used it to edge plane some rough cut cherry face frame stock with good success (using a Klingspor planer belt). Changing belts is easy, and the auto-tracking mechanism works well. I also find the speed control to be really useful. Like others I find the dust port to be on the wrong side of the tool, and it has been difficult trying to find an adapter to my vaccum that works well."
5,Nice - Does What It Is Supposed To Do,"This is the third 3"" belt sander I've owned and it is by far the best. The 9903 is fairly light and the handles allow good control. It is indeed very quiet considering the power. I was very pleased at the 16' power cord. Belt changes are not a problem. And boy does this thing suck - I mean excellent dust collection. Sanding belt tracking is good and easy to adjust.This is a very nice sander. I wish all of my purchased tools did what they were supposed to do."
5,Great belt Sander,"After owning a Black and Decker sander, the MAKITA sander was a welcomed relief. It sands quickly and evenly throughout any project. I can also clamp it in a vise for stationary work and the extra long cord is handy for larger projects. The belt STAYS tracked once its set. This a a great sander!"
5,Strong cables,"I bought those cables because of the price, I needed the three of them. (I bought another three cables locally on a store near home).So, I compared against the local ones that were more expensive (hey I live in Mexico, everything is more expensive here).These cables are stronger, and I can tell the difference in sound quality compared against the local ones, that look a little bit thinner.Being so many cables in the market, I choose a very good ones."
5,Friend thought it was real,"Delicate and lifelike. Looks good in a space where you want just a touch of decoration. Realistic in appearance, good quality materials."
1,Broke in a little over a year,"Needless to say, I am very disappointed with this product. I waited a long time to be able to afford one, when my old Black&Decker 7volt that I had for years and years finally died after I dropped it. This Makita was used very little, maybe twice a day/a few screws, and that's it. Never dropped or abused, and all of a sudden it just slips, kinda like the clutch is gone or something. I replaced it with a DeWalt. Hope that has a little longer life."
3,Not very useful for general SAS,"Great for introductory work, just not that great for advanced on the minute work with millions and millions of data points and developing new script and programs for them."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected a book discussing the state of classical music in N. America by an insider. In fact, its more of a biographic presentation of the author's establishment of a reknowned summer training camp for young musicians. Only near the end of the book does he get into the issues of classical music's continuing slide into mediocrity. It was, nonetheless, interesting, even though there's no ""red meat""."
4,One man's perspective,"Sheldon Morgenstern, conductor and Director Emeritus of the venerable Eastern Music Festival, has written what purports in its preface to be a hard, comprehensive look at the deteriorating state of the arts in general and classical music in particular in North America. The book doesn't turn out quite that way--it is mostly a career memoir, interesting and colorful enough with many telling anecdotes about one musician's formative years and influences. ""No Vivaldi in the Garage"" works best on this level. As an indictment of the sad state of the performing arts today it offers a valid portrait, but no solutions other than the oft-stated ones of not cutting music in the public schools et al. In addition, while Morgenstern must be given credit for being willing to name names, too much personal criticism of particular figures makes his writing seem at times petty and whiny."
1,Excuciatingly boring,"I recently started reading Trek novels again after not doing so for many years. Luckily, this wasn't the first one, or I might have given up.The writing is pretty good stylistically, but the plot is dead boring. I was expecting a sequel to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, not to ""For the World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky,"" a middling TOS episode at best.Too bad Dillard wasn't given the commission to write a follow up to ""The Lost Years"" instead."
3,Nice try for a first attempt,"Evidently, this is the author's first novel. It reads like a decent first attempt. He over-reaches for too many ties to figures and references from TOS, Star Trek the Movie, and ENT. However, the essential plot expanding an episode from TOS is fairly solid. Readable TOS book but hopefully the author will do better next time."
5,Original Series: Live Long And Prosper!,"I love the Original Series of Star Trek, though The Next Generation is fine also. This novel takes place very soon after the encounter with V'Ger, which Star Trek: The Motion Picture covered well. Here, the crew tries to bring peace to the planet Daran IV, with one faction clinging to the old superstitious ways and others wanting rational thought to lead to a better future, huh, kind of reminds me of modern day America! Also here is Spock struggling with the role of emotions in his life, should he let his emotions express themselves, or should he control them with logic? McCoy deals with an old love affair, if you can call it that, with McCoy also trying to keep pace with medical advances after being away from medicine awhile. I will note here that before reading this novel it would be best if a person would watch Star Trek: The Motion Picture, or read the book, the background material is useful. Overall, highly recommended."
2,Who is this Doctor McCoy?,"While the book appears to be well-researched, I cannot see how the author ever watched Doctor McCoy in action on the Original Series. Did he see the one where McCoy saved the life of a Horta (Devil in the Dark)? The idea that McCoy would go into space and then be willfully ignorant about how to treat non-humans is ridiculous. I see the book garnered a lot of great reviews, I could not suspend my disbelief on this basic premise to enjoy the rest. It was as if McCoy's character was written by General Chang from the trial in Star Trek VI. Sorry buddy, that's not the Bones I know."
2,Ho Hum for this CD,There was a lot of screaming - something i didn't expect. I wasn't crazy about this CD. I saw an interview on TV and thought I would like it.
3,Looking for a little TLT?,"The great pop factories of this world can make stars of anyone if they so wish, but it sure helps if the artist has talent. Michael Bolton came out of nowhere a few years ago with a best-selling cover version of Otis Redding's ""Dock Of The Bay"". He has since become somewhat of a Top-40 fixture but not because of any clever promotion.His voice has few peers and is ideally suited to the soulful ballads with which he has been paired.Most of the songs on this album are potential hits and help Bolton find his best form. An exception is the inclusion of the umpteenth version of the standard ""When A Man Loves A Woman"". It was squeezed in, one presumes, for the benefit of those record buyers who have been living on Mars.The album gets off to an upbeat and infectious start with the single ""Love Is A Wonderful Thing"" followed by the title track. Most of the rest lives up to the high standards Bolton has set."
5,Best CD I ever own!,"From the first time I hear Michael's sound, I couldn't get it out of my life. It touched my heart. It is something so beautiful to keep. I guess I will be Michael's fan for life."
1,"MIGHT I STATE THE WORD ""GODAWFUL""","Oh, horrible horrible horrible. Please don't waste another dime on this tripe. Make the bad man stop. Please?"
5,U CANT TOUCH THE WAY HE SINGS!!!!!,omg this is one of the best prog albums ever this is real prog like dream thetyaer and shadow gallery and its much better than pain of salvation and tool michel is the best singer ever and he doesn't rap like candleboxiria or whatever their name is they suck anywa also greticelo shut up celeen deon is not troo prog they are liek pain of salvaton go buy some real prog.
1,I could sing better.,Endless dripple. His voice is so shaky it's like an old man with Parkinson's. Don't waste your time with this one!
3,back then,"i remember i was 14 when this CD became a hit. back then i hated it. it was too sweety sweety. Only now i thing it's ok. If you take it like it is : a pop album. I particulary enjoy the duo with Patti Labelle. And you people who critize him, you should listen the barbra streisand's version of the song. awful. then you'll know that this guy has talent."
5,Two pairs each for me and husband later I'd buy 'em again!,Love these sneakers - absolutely the best. We run and lounge in them and they are real work horses. It doesn't hurt that they look good too.
5,Outstanding Tchaikovsky disc,"Outstanding versions of Tchaikovsky's three popular ballet suites. The Berlin Philharmonic is in glowing form and Mstislav Rostropovich on the rostrum sounds inspired as none else. Warmly and dynamically recorded, with plenty of orchestral detail, this thrilling disc may stand as a criterion from the analogue era.If you only need the suites, or if you think this music no longer holds any surprises for you, this is the CD to go for. Highly recommended."
5,unsurpassed,"For those who can live without the full ballets and only want the suites, they don't come any better than this, with gorgeous playing, marvellous nuances, superb pacing, and excellent recorded sound. Old Rostropovich can sure conduct as well as play the cello better than anyone who ever lived. First class classical CD."
3,Disappointing,"The performances are very good but the sound is not up to high fidelity standards. These recordings are grainy, gritty and overall nasty sounding. The music is wonderful but the sound is below par. Sorry."
3,A bit bloodless,"Opulent sounding, and in many ways excellent, especially in details of the solo playing, I found this a bit prettified and bloodless. I like the Karajan -- who often prettifies but here gets more life -- but good recordings abound."
3,Played as it should be played...,"It's the Swanlake as you like to hear it. Great orchestra, lot's of instruments. Rich sound."
3,Excerpts from Tchaikovsky's 3 ballet suites,"The selections picked for performance were wonderful and recognizable. I found that a certain verve was missing in their rendering, possibly due to the recording engineering.When listening to these ballet suites, somehow I just couldn't envision the action that I'm used to seeing on stage presentations of these three selections."
2,OVERRATED .GET EUGENE ORMANDY OR CHARLES DUTIOT VERSIONS THEY BLOW THIS ONE AWAY,"I GIVE IT 2 STARS BECAUSE THE BERLIN PHIL PLAY DESENT BUT ROSTOPOVISH IS JUST PLAIN AWFUL IV NEVER THOUGHt HE WAS EVEN REMOTLY GOOD AS A CONDUCTOR AS A CELLIST I THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST,SKIP THIS ONE I CANT FIGURE OUT WHY SO MANY PEOPLE AND MUSIC CRITICS LIKE THIS RECORDING SO MUCH.THE GENIUS TCHAIKOVSKY DESERVES ALOT BETTER.ALSO GET ERNEST ANSERMETS VERSIONS"
2,earrings,"these earrings are definetly not as thick/hardy as they appear in the picture. they look very thin and fragile in real life, like they will bend easily... not exactly what i was looking for"
1,not real silver,"these earrings were very cute! loved them until they started to turn a brownish like color, that is definatly not silver!"
5,"Good for research, history lessons or Sims lovers","Includes detailed floor plans, original advertising, prices & financing info and very 1920s style descriptions from the cataolgue. Sitting down with the book is like sitting down with the actual catalogue. There's no extraneous commentary, aside from a publisher's note.I especially recommend it to fellow early 20th century history buffs. Sim-lovers like me might appreciate the excellent conscise plans to follow (bubble machine room not included).It makes me wish *I* could order one of these ""Honor Built Houses."" There's even an order form. One fun thing to take note of is how many floor plans do *not* include a bathroom. Although they do offer outhouses ;)"
2,Nilsson - Oh please!,"I've tried and I've tried - again and again and again........but Nilsson ruins this for me.Sure, her voice is powerful and one feels she's got the whole thing in control but she overpowers the whole opera. If vocal gymastics is your thing then you'll be well pleased with what's on offer here.For me, it's about the romance. I want to feel that the players show vulnerability, and a despair that's more....quiet. I want voices to crack, to not hit every high note, to be human. I love this opera and, in the famous Furtwangler version, the music and the voice complement eachother beautifully, increasingly merging until the great final release. It draws you in and its power is ultimately more understated.The Bohm set is exciting, of that there's no doubt. But it's relentless (and tiresome) in its showcasing of Nilsson. Tristan und Isolde will always be about the emotional experience of the whole thing; the absolute quality of the singers is secondary."
3,A short addition to my previous comments.,"It might be of interest for some to read in the July 2000 issue of the ""Gramophone"" ,Richard Osborne quoting a friend , saying this beeing THE recording of Tristan for those who dislike Tristan. Be that as it may."
1,Too much hype,Not my cup of tea. The German operas are egocentric to me. And the singers all have cold voices.
5,A beautiful recording of a timelessly beautiful opera.,"As a relative newcomer to classical music and to opera as such I do not yet know how to express appreciation for this recording of this opera, and for the opera itself (which I had not heard until this recording). I think that that Wagner made the story of Tristan und Isolde into an unbelievably beautiful and moving opera. It is here flawlessly performed and recorded."
3,Herr Tristan... ?,"Yes, Kill me, but I don't agreed with the standard satisfaction with this record.Yes: B. Nilsson is sensational; the orchestra sound is fabulous; Böhm is ideal director to this work; Ludwig and Wächter are in correct places, der liebestod is enormous.But... Tristan. I don't listen to Windgassen when he sing to duet with Nilsson. Is it possible? The principal caracter appears only in third act in the great monologue. There, he affects and convinces me, but it's late.I prefer Karajan, Bernstein and even Solti. Karajan give me the more round record with a bigger-than-life Jon Vickers. And Bernstein with digital sound, quiet and fluid tempos and a real couple Behrens-Hoffman, is very pleasant."
2,Not Made for Heavy Use,"I purchased these gloves a little over 3 months ago. I work in an aquatics store, and my skin is very sensitive to being in the water. Before I switched to the gloves, my eczema was extremely severe. With the help of the gloves I was able to clear up my skin, but that meant using them every time I needed to be in the tanks, whether it were bagging fish for a customer or tank maintenance (scrubbing, gravel vacuuming etc). All was going great until two days ago when I felt water leaking into my glove. Today I found why - the seam holding the red part and the purple part together had come undone. The glove was rendered completely useless. I'm sure if you were using them less often they would work great - but considering what I paid I was very disappointed that they only lasted me a few months. Especially since they are necessary for me to do my job."
2,Durable gloves but not for delicate work,Aqua gloves are made of thick rubber which makes even holding tweezers difficult. You will end up knocking over rock formations in your reef tank. Very difficult to remove algae with these gloves. Latex gloves work much better and cost far less.
1,Truly Terrible,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, nor would I buy another in this series. The text is filled with grammatical and typographical errors, and contains very little useful information, or blatantly incorrect information. The photographs are adequate at best, while the color plates are very poor and appear to be taken from the old ""Aircraft In Profile"" series from the 1960s. You would be far better served buying one of the Osprey series books."
4,Pretty good,"It's great qualtity for the price. I had an EVGA dual tuner TV card prior to buying this one. The 500 MCE gives you a better picture and more connectivity. The colors are vibrant and the decoding is excellent. The only short coming is that MPEG decoder software is not included in the package and you'll have to purchase your own.Word of wisdom: If your picture is choppy check if your hard drive speed is up to par. I wasted almost a week; formating my hard drive 3 times, replaced my tuner card twice and swapped my CPU. I was about to buy a new mother board before I realised my hard drive was the problem. I Bought a new SATA drive and it was smoooooooth sailing."
1,Bad drivers for Windows XP x64 Edition,"This product did not work as advertised under the Windows XP x64 Edition operating system. Despite using the very latest drivers, I get a blank black display, and it works only immediately after restarting the PC (only for a short while).I ended up going with PowerColor Theater 550 Pro PCI Express x1 which has better drivers for x64 from ATI. This also freed up a PCI slot that I needed."
4,WinTV-PVR 500MCE,This is a great tuner card....does everything i want it to do....No problems what so ever.
2,Be Aware : you may receive a white box without A/V Adapter cable.,"Be aware that there are two white boxes in the market. One is older and there is no A/V Adapter cable for your Svideo input.So please make sure that you have a A/V adapter cable in the box or purchase other brands which work fine two.This is their reply :"" I'm sorry that you feel that way but it states specificallythat it does not include one. It is not a defect or missingpart it was how the model was sold. Also we still do sell a oem which is what you purchased only the kit comes with the cableset. So it is not people after a certain point lose outit is based on the model you purchased. """
1,Hauppauge 500 great concept but need better support,"I purchased this card to replace a broken PVR250 thinking I can save a PCI slot on my machine. I have had nothing but problems since I installed this card. I have two other PVR250 in the machine, using SageTV to record while I use PowerDVD version 6 to watch recorded programs. Since the installation of the card, my machine reboots frequently. I played with it for a week with no positve results. I finally had to abandon it. It is now sitting on my desk in a box. I have a 1-year old motherboard and two other PVR250 model 980 in the machine and it is working fine now without any new PVR cards. My understanding is that Hauppauge knows that they have problems with their new cards with older machines but aren't actively resolving the problem. I used to love Hauppauge but am a little let down by this whole mess!"
5,Holy Crap!,"Sooooo good. I ordered sunday night, and I got it Wednesday afternoon (today). I was a little nervous since it's a $150 item and wasn't sure it would work with my Windows 2000 Beyond TV setup (it says it only works in Windows XP MCE). I used the installation guide and drivers from Snapstream's web page - and I installed and setup everything up in what seemed like 15 minutes. I was also concerned when I got it because there was only one co-axial input - I just assumed there would need to be two since it's a dual-tuner - but no, you can record 2 channels off of that one input ( I thought I'd need to split the signal! ). Not only that, but (and maybe I'm horrible about reading fine print) but it has a FM-radio input as well. That was a nice bonus."
4,This particular set can be had from Scholastics ...,"I love the blue covered set of encyclopedias. They seem very durable and colorful. My children started reading Volume A as though it was a book. It had easy to read articles with detailed color photos. It goes into some depth without getting too technical, but covering subjects surprisingly well.You can get a free copy of Volume 1/A at scholastic books. But you will have to cancel or by the whole set when volume 2/B arrives. The price is actually good, comparatively. Don't pay any extra for special shipping -- try the trial version."
5,A stunning debut,"Why this amazingly gifted young woman isn't a major star already is beyond me -- she sings like a fragile, wise-beyond-her-years, yet somehow hopeful angel, and her songs are instantly catchy & memorable, even if you don't speak a word of French. And as wonderful as this debut is, her subsequent releases only get better. But this is the place to start if you want something far more enticing & artistic than the generic, mass-produced ""pop"" that currently swamps the airwaves. Yes, genuine songcraft & performance still exist, and you'll find them both in heartbreaking abundance from Keren Ann. Most highly recommended!"
2,"Neat idea, poor product","As an avid Pepsi collector, I was thrilled to receive this for Christmas. Unfortunately, the fan is very loud, and it doesn't quite keep the soda cold. No matter how long it's in there, the soda is always ""almost cold""."
2,Waste of Money,"My kids wanted a vending machine, but didn't have the room. I thought the PVM545 Pepsi Dispenser would be a good compromise, even after hearing the comments about the loud fan, not keeping drinks ""ice"" cold, and the presence of water where the drinks are dispensed, I decided it was worth the risk. Not only were all of the above concerns true, but after six months the fan stopped working. The online retailer referred me to the company that makes them (the Helman Group). I contacted the Helman Group and since it was past the 90 day warranty, Helman essentially indicated that I was out of luck. No, ""Sorry, how can we make it right"". No, ""We can locate a part for you"", No, ""We can give you a partial credit for another machine"". Just a standard form email that said were were out of warranty. Additional attempts to reach the company to try to get a part number or see if they had aftermarket parts went unanswered. Steer clear from this product and this unresponsive company."
4,Pepsi cold drink dispenser,"It is as billed. I got this for my Dads birthday. He has not had a chance to set it up, but he very happy with it. It was shipped the very next day and my Dad received as of delivery date. Thank you for a smooth transaction."
4,My hair has too much kink!,It wasn't quite what i was expecting. I didn't love the smell and it didn't really keep my curly hair straight. But it does work better than some other products I've tried.
3,"Excellent political storyline, bad combat stories!","This book depicts the events leading to the invasion of St. Ives Compact by the Capellan Confederation. As such the story unfolds through strategy and political measures taken by both sides. There were few mech combats and I found them rather uninspiring and lack the depth of tactical combat. The story also jumps back and forth between the Capellan and St. Ives point of view, which gets confusing at times.I whole-heartedly recommend this book to those people who enjoys political thriller. But if u r like me and enjoys intense tactical combat actions, this book is not worth your time!"
2,"Fine writing, boring book","The book was written well, but overall...it was really a VERY non-important part of the BTech universe. I kind of see the book as a waste, becuase it kind of re-covers events during Operation Serpant that really didn't matter. The whole book could have been summed up in a few sentances. No surprises or big events here...really a yawn. However, it was written well...if that means anything. But, i you enjoy the would-be exploits (there really were only a ew skirmishes) of some no-name pilots from Liao...you may enjoy it."
1,Disappointed!,"I am really disappointed by this book.Sun Tzu is still hungry for power and does not care the least bit for his people! The first new elected Star Lord is the first one to abuse that position, too. I know the result of this two book ""solution"" and hope he will pay for that.The authors really do have problems: they do not know enough of militarian behaviour. To make their goals available - most of the time against all odds - the heroes must be nearly unbeatable or ""immortal"" and the opponents must act stupid!The CC was the smallest of the ""big Houses"" and owned a downed military. So how does it come to that famous victories for them? ==> Shifting the odds (by the author)!Once I liked the CC for its exotic and religious ways and the peace!!full way of Asian philosophy (even the mad ancestors did not threaten that image) but this Sun Tzu is one to cast away!I hope that the new Precentor Martialum will pay him back within 10 books!It would be justice!"
4,Good tool. Impressed by the dust bag.,"Very nice tool from Makita. I remained impressed by the dust collector, which really works well. I choose the Free shipping and amazon delivered in 3 days (including order day). I would not by the small 3""x21"" (which cost more money... don't ask me why..) unless you plan to buy also a 4"" x 24"". Good experience in general"
2,Broke this tool after a drop of 18 inches.,Yes it is a nice handling belt sander that is very light. However the lightness comes from the aluminum frame. I had this a few months when it fell off an 18 inch high table onto my garage floor. Broke a cast aluminum shaft that holds the front roller. Sent it back for factory service and as told that they do not guarantee against physical damage. I guess that defective design is not covered. However they were considerate enough to give me a deal reducing the cost of repair from about $150 to $75. So hold on tight and store near the floor.
4,Makita 9920 Belt Sander,"This is a strong, relatively quiet sander. Seems well designed and easy to use. One complaint though, it would be really nice if Makita offered this sander with a carrying/storage case. If they do, I missed it."
5,Well advised by reviews,"Having read several Amazon reviews concerning disk sanders I selected this machine based on the good comments from far more knowlegeable wood workers. To say the least the process proved to be a good way to study something you don't know a great deal about.The unit tracks well, easy to change belts, heavy enough to get the belt to the wood but light enough to manage, plenty of power and very effective at the task I bought it for.The project entailed smoothing out ruff cut cedar boards to a manageable finish for a project. This was done with-in 6 hours (60 boards, two sides 4"" X 5'-0"") with results that I found acceptable. I would also recommend this sander, Thanks Amazon for your earlier reviews...they helped."
2,could've thought of these activities myself,This is not the greatest. Many of the suggested activities are so basic that I think most people have done them with their kids already. But my toddler did enjoy playing with the cards they were printed on....
3,The dangers of falling in love with explorers' tales,"Instead of being subtitled ""A Perilous Trek Through the Greatest African Desert"", this book should have been subtitled ""The Dangers of Trying to Recreate Your Favorite Explorer Tales"".Isn't there a line in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" about Lawrence being one of those ""desert loving English"". What we have here is the tale of a Arabic-speaking modern American who has fallen in love with the desert and the explorer tales of traveling with Bedouins across Arab's Empty Quarter, so naturally as a writer, he wants to recreate this hero's journey so he can write about it. And while he does make it all the way across the Moroccan Sahara to the Atlantic Ocean, even across Western Sahara where there's a war on and it's heavily mined and they really don't want tourists, he spares us none of the messy discomfort and all of the wonder. His paragraph on buying green, fly-specked meat in a market is longer than the section on the 10 different local words for desert."
4,Good Calcium,A little large to swallow...I can tell it works by looking at my nails.No bad after taste which isn't bad for 6 caps a day!
3,Just a twist on the original.,"The SWWWII pack is a good idea for the series, but I think it could have been a better game. The expansion doesn't add anything to the campaign mode and you have to play the battles as an instant to use the map. The maps themselves aren't bad but the AI is just as dumb as the original. With generally the same weapons and vehicles except for an occasional new thing, it is basically the same game with just different maps. I would recommend getting this expansion, but buy it in the collection so you aren't paying full price for this game."
4,A Much Needed Boost on the Original!,"This is a superb expansion. I thought the original was fun, but this is GREAT! The new weapons rock, as well as the motorbikes and bombers. This is a HUGE improvement on the original, and definately should be purchased."
3,Zombies,"It was very short, and not what I had expected. However, it was very interesting. A ""maybe"" movie if you are curious."
5,Where is the DVD for this film?!!!!,"I have loved this film since the first time I saw it on cable over 10 years ago. Not only did it remind me of my own first experiences with Alaska more than 20 years ago, but the classic ""seat of your pants"" approach to the journey (it's not where you're going, but how you get there that matters) is something everyone should experience in their lives.I finally came across the VHS version in an Office Depot about 8 years ago and snatched it right up. I fail to understand why it has never been released on DVD. Even my favorite Indy films come out on DVD these days! What gives?"
5,Sensuously Touching,"Leaving Normal is definitely one of my most favorite movies. Those who compare this movie to Thelma and Louise are incredibly mistaken. If I had to compare this film to any other it would be Fried Green Tomatoes. Both films portray, quite simply, the strength of two women's friendship in the feriocity of life--a friendship that, I would argue, blurs the boundaries between the platonic and the passionate. Currently, I am studying in Europe, miles from home, and this movie, although it's been years since I've seen it, has crept into my homesick mind, and makes me yearn for my best friend at home. And Meg Tilly's childhood character's altered words to a famous nursery rhyme song tung gently at my dreams...""twinkle, twinkle little star how I wonder where you are? up above the world so high, when I find you I will fly"""
5,"""Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.""-Albert Camus","This movie is the story of two strangers who become friends and get over their weaknesses, guilt and uncertainties. For once in their lives, the two friends decide to stop making decisions, since all their previous choices were wrong and together they start an unforgettable journey of becoming themselves, not what others wanted them to be.Meg Tilly and Christine Lahti deliver an excellent performance of a smart, funny and sensitive story. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It is no surprise that this movie didn't get the attention it deserves; for truly the masses only notice normal things."
3,God bless us everyone in Alaska,"This movie was quite good until the ending when it became silly and contrived. It could have come out of a Disney movie. Again, men are treated like swine obssessed with body parts and the sex act devoid of any idealistic or romantic sensibilities. I'm sick of this &*%$."
5,A must have books,"I'm very please with this purchase, the content and the edition are wonderfull, I highly recomend ti."
5,"Getting your ""act"" together","Sandra Felton is charming and witty in this book - no dry reading here! Lots of good advise and amazing insight into the minds of all of us ""messies"" out here. Ms. Felton has many tips for organizing your life as well as your house. Truly a MUST READ!Deanna Barr"
3,Too basic for me,"I've read so many books on housekeeping that this book really didn't offer anything I hadn't seen elsewhere. Also, after perusing this book I realized that I'm not the messie I used to be.If you are a major messie and haven't read many books about it then you may like this. Personally, I've received more motivation studying feng shui. Now that I know *why* I should clean up, it's easier to feel motivated to do so."
1,Useless on organisation - self-esteem psycho-babble,"If you are looking for straightforward tips on how to get organised, this is NOT the book for you. Self-indulgent, unresearched - Sandra Felton babbles on about women like her with no idea or interest in the reality of ther people's lives. Aboslute drivel."
1,Not Made for the Car,"It is smaller than OEM filter, falls into the air cleaner box, does not stay there as it should. Not made for the car it says was made for.Uneven foam gasket construction. Cardboard-like cheap paper element. Made in Mexico."
5,Over the top Bach,"Lehmann's passionate and moving reading of Cantata 4 features the young Fisher-Dieskau in a very intense and operatic rendition of some of Luther's juicier poetry. The determined and almost martial Helmut Krebs does a superb job in the tenor solo. Fischer-Dieskau recorded Cantatas 56 and 82 many times; in this recording his voice is rich, young, and beautiful, and Ristenpart accompanies him well."
5,Taming the Star Runner,"This book was one of S.E. Hinton's best! You knew exactly what the characters were thinking and feeling. It has so much emotion and understanding on teen issues, that are still around today. I would recomend this book to anyone! It's ideal for ages 12-25."
5,Frighteningly Good!,"When one comes across recordings like this there's always a risk of hyperbole. As simple as possible: these are exciting, inspiring, near-perfect performances of the Ravel operas. The engineering matches in quality. If you like Ravel, if you like opera, or if you're just curious about what a ""near-perfect"" performance sounds like then jump at this set. Also, the fillers are equally stunning. I've never heard (or even hoped for) a Capriccio Espagnol as striking as the one included. This collection, along with DG's release of Maazel's Firebird and El Amor Brujo (in this same series--and also great) has prompted a re-examination of earlier recordings by Lorin Maazel. Thanks DG and...Wow!"
4,bewitched by the bewitched child,"Ravel's two operas focus on the world of the child and it is perhaps where his influence will be felt the most. Musically he is able to capture a melodic line in all of its simplicity and amplify and back it up with orchestration unrivaled in his day. It is imaginitive and sparkles, like the passage in ""L'enfant"" where he has the strings in successive glissandi to imitate the sound of cats meow-ing. It is easy to see how influential he was on composer Oliver Knussen who set his opera to Maurice Sednak's ""Where the Wild Things are"" in the mid-1980s. The recording under Maazel is clear and crisp and would recommend this one over the new Previn one because you get BOTH of Ravel's operas. IF you do not have a recording of Ravel's Ma Mere L'oye (Mother goose Suite) then that one is probably the best bet. BUT the BEST recording of the Mother Goose Suite hands down is still Boulez w/ Berlin Philharmonic (and that comes with a bunch of other orchestral goodies)."
4,FANTASTIC!!!,A brilliant Afrojazz album which makes you feel good!I thoroughly loved this album and wish they would tour the UK
4,Great backgound information and good instructions,"This book gives very good instruction on the exercises of the taiji ruler. The text provides a great deal of background information on the ruler as well. I did not find the ""scientific"" explanations to be of great interest though. The photos showing the exercises were very helpful but the Taoist material was of no great value."
5,"Solid, helpful advice","The ideas on dealing with bedtime hassles made my life, and my girl's, much easier. She can still be difficult, but I've learned how to respond more effectively."
2,No new information,"This book offers ""cookie-cutter"" solutions to parenting problems. I felt that there was nothing new presented in the book...simplistic ideas that you can find in any parenting book. It's common sense that you should reinforce the positives, reward good behavior, spend time with your child, listen without judging so that the child doesn't get defensive. If you're a beginner to this type of thinking this book is for you. If you've been around and around the block with your ""hard to handle child"" you'll find better information in ""Setting Limits with your Strong-Willed Child"" by Robert MacKenzie. For a Christian perspective, try ""Boundaries with Kids"" by Cloud and Townsend."
5,Unfair! That Magician Uses Magic,"Adam the neophyte magician travels to the city of magic to audition for the Guild of Magicians. He causes an uproar by using real magic - to startling (and unintentional) effect. Of course the other magicians realize that they cannot possibly allow real magic along side their common tricks - how mortifying to be thus exposed. But how can they rid themselves of someone so naively powerful? Amidst the desperate guild and their dastardly plan to trick Adam, he finds at least one friend. Or not. Maybe? This is a laugh-out-loud comedic romp that reflects deep meanings of life, purpose, and friendship. Paul Gallico's best!"
2,"Looks good, pours poorly",I sent it back because the spout drips. I tried pooring slowly and very quickly but there didn't seem to be a way to pour the tea without making a mess.
5,Easy to Install - Wonderful Results,"I am no computer techie, but I do know how to do some things inside a computer. On a scale of 1 to 10 for ease of installation, I give this card a solid 9. The instructions were easy to follow and I had no problems.I bought the card so that some of the games I have would run, either better, or at all. The card produces outstanding graphics, and the improvement was immediately noticeable.There are less expensive video cards out there, but this one is worth the money!"
3,"Pros, but Cons as well...","When I bought this book I was looking for a way to indentify various stones that I inherited from my Grandmother. This book if great if you're looking at selling or profiting from your stones AND willing to spend $$$ in advance to do it. The book basically lists equiptment, where to buy it, how much it costs, etc... and then how to use said equiptment to identify stones. I was looking for something that would help me to identify stones without spending $1000 before hand.The book is quite complete however. I would recommend this book to someone who is wanting to get into the gemstone business. I wouldn't recommend this book to someone, like me, who is just curious about what lies in their hope chest."
5,You NEEDThis Book...,"There are at least 3 dozen gemstone ID or how to buy the perfect gem books on my shelves. The three that sit next to the computer are Walter Schumann's Gemstones of World and two by Antoinette Matlins - Gem ID Made Easy and Color Gemstone Buying Guide. As a Jewelry Design, Lapidary and Gemology student I am always reaching for for one or the other. Thanks Antoinette we always get your best effort!!!"
5,Excellent value,"I had looked through some gemology books in the past, but found them too scientific and intimidating. This book is very readable and informative. The reader will understand how three inexpensive tools can be used to evaluate the majority of gems. The book also describes how the reader can go about getting more information and further expanding their knowledge. This is a book well worth having for anyone wishing to learn about gemology."
4,Gems,"This was a good book, explained many aspects well. Sometimes a little hard to follow. Written for the experienced buyer."
1,gem identification made easy,"Still waiting for book to arrive, I waiting for the end of the month before I got a hold of you. If it dosen't get here I'll notifi you about this"
4,great information,This was just the book I was looking for. I just recently started to get into collecting colored gemstones and this book was full of great information on what tools I would need and how to use them. That was so important to me.
2,AWEFUL VISUALS - IT'S LIKE A 1950'S TEXT BOOK W/ B&W PICTURES,"I SEE THAT EVERYONE SEEMS TO THINK THIS BOOK IS THE BEST THING SINCE ...I DON'T KNOW WHAT. BUT I HATED IT AND RETURNED IT. THIS IS LIKE ONE OF THOSE AWEFUL, CHEAP, TEXT BOOKS THAT YOU HAVE TO BUY IN THE COLLGE BOOK STORE 'CAUSE IT'S BEEN OUT OF PRINT FOR 30 YEARS... THERE WERE MOSTLY ALL SMALL B&W PICTURES, JUST A FEW PAGES OF COLORED STONES...THIS, IN MY OPINION, IS NOT FOR ANYONE CREATIVE OR VISUAL. YUCK!"
1,He's not so much of a plagiarist,"I previously wrote this: ""In other spheres, take a look at an original article: [...] (I know the author) ... and then at Chris Harris's article, [...]. It is lifted intact and without attribution. He has not yet explained himself. I don't believe plagiarists should be supported."" In the day since I wrote that, he inserted a paragraph that cites the original authors. I would guess, therefore, that he's not a plagiarist, but that he's careless in how he uses others' work. Still be careful about attribution."
2,Needs updated and edited,"The number of errors in the code and processes in the book make it very frustrating for beginners. I think with a good rewrite and update for Xcode, and more careful editing (some errors were obviously a result of the production process, missing lines of code that were included in the online extras files, missing steps in development instructions, and such) this would be a useful beginner's book."
2,Not very good,"This is not a very good book for learning Objective C and Cocoa. The author programmes in Basic, and it shows. Get the much better introduction called Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X from Aaron Hillegass."
2,Old version of X-code,"I guess the book was great when published.Today it is a little bit outdated due to the new version of X-code (4) that is quite different from (3).If you are still on (3), go for it."
1,Pathetic for the cost,"You would think that, given the cost and the fact that the batteries/charger cost AS MUCH as the vacuum - you'd be getting some commercial level quality.This is NOT the case. Anything over the dust-bunny level isn't going to get picked up by this. Save your $$ and just get a Black and Decker. Or 4 for that matter."
2,DON'T MISS THE FINE PRINT!,"Carefully note that this item is shipped WITHOUT BATTERY! If you have other 9.6V Makita tools this might be OK, but I don't, and I didn't read the description carefully before ordering.So now it's time to evaluate the additional cost of a battery and charger AND THEN determine whether the performance is worth the (total) price."
3,Average quality product,"The pad was pretty much as expected. It came in a thick plastic bag, but it was too tight/sticky to get it back in there easily. That is unfortunate, because the cover would have been nice to protect the foam while hiking. The pad is not particularly durable. One reason I picked this particular pad is I thought the attached straps would be nice. However, the metal buckles weren't very good. Plastic would have been better, or even velcro would have been fine."
5,This is cool - my hubby loves it,This is a really cute sign for my hubby's garage... it is made just like a handicap or stop sign - I like it and so does he:)
3,z-looke is back again!,yep Z-looke is definately back again even though i loved their ist release featuring the smash can you read my lips.this release is not so bad my favorite cut is the monster jam GIRL DANZ WITH ME it shoud have been much bigger but really a keeper! I BOUGHT THIS CD WHEN IT CAME OUT AND BOUGHT MY NEW COPY ON AMAZON .COM AMAZING SELECTION.
3,Disappointed in information--returned book,"Eventhough I may not have really saved any money, I did not see any point in keeping this book once I received and reviewed it. I ordered for my son in law who lives on Fl coast and loves to fish coastal waters. He wanted a book to give information about the birds he saw then. I was hoping the size and information in this one would make it good for his purpose. This was not the case, however.More than half of the book is concerned with ecological and birdwatching information--that is just not what he was looking for. I was disappointed in the size of photographs of the birds, but when so much is given to other aspects not that much room for bird information is left.The quality of construction seemed good, but the spine is fairly narrow and the book needs to be opened fully to read all the text. It is possible that repeated readings may cause some pages to come loose.On the hunt again"
4,Florida's Birds,I gave this book as a gift to friends who hosted my visit in January. They loved it and used it immediately. I felt it could have had larger pictures.
4,Looks good so far,"I got this book to take along on a trip to Florida planned for a couple of months from now, so at this point it's too early to say exactly how helpful it is. However, based upon previous trips to Florida, it seems to be pretty good so far (although there are two birds I've previously seen that I still couldn't find in this guide)."
1,Tough as Leather Shoes!,"Wow - was I ever disappointed. I have had this in the past, and it was moist, chewy, and delicious. This stuff is so dry and hard that you can't even chew it! I will never order it again (I have two bags of jerky - one unopened - anyone want a deal on it?)."
1,WORST Jerkey,This jerky was dry and impossible to chew. What a disappointment for my husband when he opened it in his stocking this Christmas.
2,Thinest stale turkey jerky.,"I have never had worst product. It was extremely hard and tasteless. I can't believe that I paid so much for it. I gave it two stars instead of one so people will read this review. Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food. The package picture misrepresents the product. Very little brown turkey, I would never buy it at a store. I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star. I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before."
2,I am a little unhappy,"I have been purchasing this product for over a year and lately my jerky is hard as a rock. I have been feeling like my over $30.00 per month is wasted:(. i have recommended this product to many people, but now I feel bad."
4,Really good stuff!,"This turkey jerky is really good. Just the right amount of flavor and chewiness. I only wish it wasn't so expensive. Love that it's gluten free and all natural, so we'll keep ordering!"
1,Terrible low quality pressed bits in tiny bags,"This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful."
1,it sucked!!!,"It sucked, cause I never got it, until this day I never heard from the sender, the good think was that I got my money back."
