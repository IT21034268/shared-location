1,Very Cheap,"One of the reasons I bought this product was the finish, but it was also inexpensive. Unfortunately, it is just plain cheaply made. I received the item without the hardware, the seller and manufacturer responded quickly, but I had to wait an additional week before I could put it together. Once I got the hardware, the screws and hanger bolts didn't work well together. So much so that one of the hanger bolts got stuck and started turning with the screw. In addition, there were numerous cracks and the stain on the product was very uneven. Light in some places and dark, not subtle changes, but large changes in color. I don't know if it would hold my quilt or not as I never got the chance to finish putting it together without breaking it. But I suspect it would not have held my quilt, perhaps a light blanket but not a heavy quilt."
1,The Worst Piece of Furniture I've Ever Had,"Don't buy this unless you have a dremel, wood glue, and a lot of free time! The pieces are supposed to slide together, but were so poorly cut that half of them couldn't even be fit into the proper slots. The other half were often too small. The slots are also cut so that the wood is extremely thin in the places where it will need to bear weight, which means if you try to push the pieces that are a bit to big in, you'll crack them very easily. There's no way it would be able to hold anything over a few pounds once assembled.Because this was a gift and I really did like the look of the piece, I used a small dremel bit to sand down some of the pieces so they would actually fit together. I then filled the numerous large cracks left by the pieces that were too small with a LOT of wood glue, and glued the larger pieces in place as well. It now seems to be fairly sturdy."
3,Blanket Rack,I returned the item as it was not what I had expected. The company was very gracious in accepting my return.
1,GARBAGE,Do not buy this item! It broke apart with 1 small blanket hanging on it after extremely gentle use. It was like a scene out of a Chevy Chase movie. I could not decide if I wanted to laugh or cry. It is cheap and not worth the money.
2,pieces missing or wrong parts,"I chose this product as a Christmas present for my oldest daughter, when it arrived it was in a small box.When she opened it Christmas day to put it together the screws were the wrong ones, the parts did not fit together at all and a piece was broken on it. When I contacted the company all they wanted to do was send correct screws. She can't do anything with broken pieces that don't fit together. I am still waiting for an answer on if they are taking the old one back and sending a new one with correct pieces that match, that was a week and a half ago."
3,Arts & Crafts Honey-Glass Table Lamp,"Overall, I was pleased with this lamp and its final ""look"" on my side table! It is pretty nice in all respects except one. The attachments of the honey glass to the shade are not very precise,and it was impossible to get a perfect fit of the glass within the shade on two of the four panes. One of those panes actually fell out, but luckily did not break. It is still not quite right. Other than that, I wish I had a floor lamp to match it - maybe with an integral table built in. Maybe I missed it; but I can't seem to find it. Price was a little steep, considering the fit and finish issues. But I got a decent lamp."
5,The best book you can read,"This was a very inspirational book.I always though gay guys always acted one way and were pretty gross.After reading this i have a whole new respect for the gay and lesbian community.I really used to look down on lesbians too considering im a girl,but they are normal just like us so i dont see why people have to beat them up,call them names,and look down upon them.I recomend this book to anyone who is really narrow minded or is a gay or lesiban."
4,Sweet story,"Nelson, who is openly gay, is best friends with Kyle, who is not yet open to his parents though he is to Nelson. Nelson thinks he might like Kyle as more than a friend, but Kyle is obsessed with Jason, a star basketball player who is confused about his sexuality.This is a sweet story about friendship, family, and self-discovery. Sanchez does a great job showing how each coming out experience is different and how the first stages of gay relationships can be tricky because of the lack of traditional roles and rules."
3,Rainbow Boys....,"I had to read this for a class...not a bad buy, especially considering it was cheap! I liked the story enough, and there's a squeal, but mostly I needed it for the report for school."
4,A touching story - a little heavy on teen self-help,"You will enjoy this book. I read it in one delightful sitting on a rainy evening. The characters came to life, aroused me at times, made me almost cry a couple times as I thought of some of my own really awful experiences coming out in high school, but brought me right back to the triumphs of surviving high school and those experiences.This reviewer only gives the book 4 stars because the author tries SO hard at times to make the book self-help for teens when it could have just been an absolutely wonderful on its own. Do not let this deter you from reading it or recommending it to any teenager - it is great and informative, and the last few pages offer resources for teens. Maybe I should've just given it 5 stars and let it go, but the self-help angle takes away from the integrity and flow of the story from time to time."
4,A Stand-out in the Genre,"I first heard about this novel, after reading the novel ""boy meets boy."" While ""Boy Meets Boy"" will probably be my favorite book in the genre, ""Rainbow Boys"" will definatly a close second.The Book centers around 3 boys who are seniors in their local high school and happen to be gay. Nelson and Kyle have been best friends for years. Nelson has a crush on Kyle, but Kyle has his eye on Jason the star athlet in school. And one day when Jason shows up at a local Gay Teen Support group (regularly attending by Kyle and Nelson) none of them really know how much their lives are really going to change.This novel is a realistic view on being gay in highschool and the problems they face: rejection, bashing, first loves, crushes, HIV scars, and age discrimination.For a debut novel, this book is really good. My only complaint in that the character of Nelson really should have taken a backseat to teh storyline between the two other boys."
4,"For what it is, it's not bad at all.","As a coming of age story written for a young readership, ""Rainbow Boys"" achieved everything it tried to do. It was definitely educational in a way that managed to avoid too much preachiness, and it didn't really shortchange any of the issues it addressed. (The danger of contracting HIV, for instance.) For a more mature reader, it was good, but not excellent. The plot was solid, but there were some distractingly cringeworthy moments of dialogue and description. (I winced over 'A trickle of saliva glistened...' during what should have been a very sweet moment. Yuck.) But I do think that the shifting point of view worked well, which surprised me. Definitely worth a read if you're interested in the genre."
4,A Great Book for Struggling Teens,"Rainbow Boys is a great book for teens struggling with their sexuality, as well as parents and friends of those same teens. It addresses many of the issues ...homosexual teens face in a realistic and educational way, while still being a great read. The characters are well-drawn and you come to care about their lives. While at times it may have felt like the author was trying to include too many issues, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was especially impressed by the list of resources at the end. I admire the fact that the author isn't just writing for entertainment alone, but also recognizes the responsibility of ...homosexual authors today to educate, inform and assist. I highly recommend this book."
4,Growing-up and Coming-out,This is an encouraging story of how two boys find themselves and convey their feelings for one another. I read the book in two days only b/c I was too busy working to actually read. I then passed the book on to half of my college's LGBT club. It was a great story super fast read and very enjoyable. He captures a lot of the feelings of struggling queer youth. Yes it's another coming of age story about growing up and coming out but hey sometimes they're fun reads.
3,Well-intentioned but not entirely successful,"Despite fond childhood memories, Apache has dated badly. One of the vogue for pro-Native American westerns during the mid-50s (Broken Arrow, Devil's Doorway, etc), this is definitely one of the lesser offerings despite the promising pairing of a painfully miscast Burt Lancaster and Robert Aldrich, who would make amends some 20 years later with the remarkable Ulzana's Raid. The script is a prime offender here, both simplistic and patronising, offering little for either man to really get their teeth into. There are a few good moments, but the sight of Lancaster and Morris Ankrum in brownface remains the film's lasting image.MGM/UA's transfer is acceptable, although the colour system used to shoot the film originally has not held up well and leads to a variable look to the film. The original theatrical trailer - bizarrely played as a breaking news report - is included."
3,not to much into westerns,I am not a big fan of westerns but my mom melane wanted the movie because I think she liked burt lancaster
3,Metaphysical,Somewhat hard to understand topics unless one has a truly metaphysical point of view. Seems to require prior knowledge of subjects.
5,Awe-inspiring,The pictures in this book capture what I believe to be angels on canvas. The paintings of this amazing young lady are remarkable. She is truly someone for whom I hold the greatest respect.
5,"Not your typical Jules Verne, but definitely a classic!","MICHAEL STROGOFF is not the typical Jules Verne novel one might expect. It's not the science fiction that he is so well known for. It is however an adventure that is sure to please, just like his scientific adventures (JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH, FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA). This novel is more comparable to his lesser known FUR COUNTRY, which is also highly recommended. MICHAEL STROGOFF is the story of the currier of the czar of Russia during a Mongol invasion. There's adventure, romance, strategy, comedy and just about a little something for everyone else. All combined, MICHAEL STROGOFF is an exciting, quick read that will surely entertain just about any reader."
5,collecting Scribners Illustrated Classics NC Wyeth Illustrator,"It was great to be able to pick up this original Scribner's Classic with paste-on book plate in excellent condition!I've been looking for this title for years! Good price, quick shipping, product in just the condition described in ad! Bring on some more!"
4,great adventure,Great adventure across the Siberian plains. Lots of twists and turns that keep the reader honest. Vivid desciptions of life during Czarist Russia and the great divide between East and West.
5,A great book,"This book was one of the most thrilling books I have ever read. It wasn't science fiction but it was full of adventure and fun. What was great about the book was that the reader didn't have too much of an intense outlook on the heroes because there were two other characters- journalists, one French and the other English who helped you understand and enjoy the story more. READ THE BOOK!- one of my favourites!"
3,Not Very Helpful,"I found that this book would have been helpful for pond plants or if I needed a recipe to cook something I had raised in a pond, but I wanted information on keeping fish in a pond. Specifically I was interested in catfish, and silly me, I 'judged the book by its cover.' This book provides very little helpful infomation on raising pond fish as a hobby. If you're interested in spending several thousand dollars to commercially raise fish such as trout, then this book has something to offer. Otherwise don't bother."
5,Ponds,This was an excellent book for information on our pond. We will find it and the references inside very useful!
3,Bitter Sweet,"I bought these shoes and absolutely loved the way they look. However, the shoes run small. So the size that I bought were too small to wear and I had to give them away. I recommend everyone too buy at least an half size larger."
5,Just fits,This elbow was made to go with the Delta 50560 Hand Shower. Installation was easy and makes the transition from shower to shower head look very neat.
5,Great pack..,"My son like it so much that after 2 years when we had to buy him a new one, its the only we wanted."
5,Multiplying benefits add up,"My recent purchase of a Sharp Electronics EL344RB 10-Digit Calculator from Amazon was a calculated decision after searching for yonks to find a replacement for my 20-year old metric conversion calculator. Turns out that the one I have just bought is the 21st Century version of my old one ... and it performs even better!!!I'm very pleased with my new ""working tool"" and can tell we're going to enjoy a long and satisfactory working life. Thanks to Amazon!"
4,Great for CB900C,This manual describes pretty much anything you would ever need to do to your motorcycle. All pictures are black and white but the written instructions are detailed.
2,"Not for Custom Models, beware","After hubby got this to work on our 82 Honda CB900 Custom, then he noticed that it covered all but the Custom models. Have yet to be able to find one that does cover the Custom Models. Hubby hopes that it will at least give him some basics to be able to work on ours."
3,"Average jogging stoller, if you find a good price - buy it!","The best feature of this stroller is the adjustable handle! I am always lowering the handle and my husband is always raising it since it is done so easily. Everything else is just like every other stroller out there. The seat is fine, the wheels are fine, etc etc. I walked to our local health club and back pushing this stroller which was a total of 11+ miles and did not have aches and pains like I do after pushing our ""mall stroller"". (foldable Combi) It is worth mentioning that we do have another stroller as this one does not fold very well and is not something you would want to push around a mall or other busy function. I would not pay a lot of $$$ for this stroller, but I would buy it again for what we paid (I think about $120-$150, whatever it was on Amazon)"
4,Jogging for Joy,"This is a great light weight stroller that's great for walking, jogging, or running. It's not your typical mall stroller because the front wheel is fixed, so maneuvering around corners is a little tricky. It's hard to fold for storage because it does not stand up easily on the three wheels and falls over. I was able to fit it into the trunk of my 07 camry, but it took several attempts, and I'm still not quite sure how to do fit it on the first time now. But it does fold and fit. I looked around for a while before settling on this stroller and I'm very satisfied with my purchase since I did not want to invest several hundred dollars on a stroller."
3,Short seat!!,"I bought this to replace my old Schwinn jogger that I dearly loved but had a broken seat. This stroller has a lot of great features. I love the adjustable canopy and handle.The parent console and child tray are handy. Fold is very simple. However, as a previous reviewer noted, one of my back wheels wouldn't snap into place and once it did, it popped back out at some point and I can't get it to stay secured. Also, the seatback is very short and has a rod that borders the entire outer edge of it. My daughter's head bangs against it when we go over bumps. She's 2 and just isn't comfortable in it. She complains after about 15 minutes in the stroller, tells me she wants to go home. I've started using another stroller for our long walks and she's fine. I was hoping to get to use this until she was at least 3, but there is just no head support for her."
2,"Bought as Replacement, Not being Used","I have an ancient Lancome facial brush that I was attempting to replace. I bought this brush, tried it, and went back to my old one. In my opinion, this brush is far too soft and doesn't feel like it is cleaning at all. A wash cloth would be better."
2,How to make a bad movie.........,"I dont see too much originality here, seems the story is borrowedfrom multiple of other movies.1. Boring script2. Very Boring actors/actresses3. Creature looks good, but its always in the dark and too manyquick shots, could have been lot better.4. Too much crawling around air ducts...what a waste of film.I cant even recommend this one for a viewing....maybe after a kegof beer it might look good."
5,Goes well with the Documentary.,I just recently saw the documentary about this very unusual family and was intrigued enough to buy this book and will probably buy some othe Crumb things. This explains in more detail what happened to Charles Crumb and why. His drawings are very disturbing. Maxon's drawings are also of a disturbing bent. There are some comics from all members of the family and some beautiful drawings by Crumb himself.Maxon wrote the introduction and there are also excerpts of Charles letters. One picture of the mother sort of tells the whole story.
2,"Durable, But Not Fun","I was very excited to buy this for my 2 1/2 year old, but the excitement dwindled once it arrived. It is a very well made toy (like most Fisher Price toys are) but it lacks the entertainment needed to entertain our on the go kids. As much as he loves Diego, the toy didn't entertain him past 8 button pushes. He's an imaginitive boy and plays pretend, but this did not spark his imagination or creative play. He's gotten way more entertainment from the box it came in (he pretends it's a cage for his little people animal)than the toy itself.This toy has been tossed in the toy chest since it's arrival day and hasn't left since. It's position has slowly moved down to the bottom of the box; I occassionally dig through the toys and move it to the top in hopes that he'll play with it again. I have now lost all hope and the next time I go to dig it out, I will be removing it and dropping it off at Goodwill.(The 2 stars is for craftsmanship)"
3,Go Diego Talking Rescue Radio,My daughter loves Go Diego Go so I bought her the Talking Rescue Radio - I can't figure it out the catalog says there are 16 animal rescues we can only find 4. She is now tired of it and doesn't play with it anymore.
3,It's mostly a reference manual,"For me personaly it's too complicated.This book mostly intends for high level specialists and can be used as a reference manual.If you already know about GSM and only want to understand what is GPRS and how it's differ from GSM, this book is not for you."
3,Mozart the romantic?,"If you like your Mozart played like Chopin, this is a great disc. If, like me, you like fairly strict tempi and a ""classical"" approach, stay away. Fou Ts'ong loves his rubato, so much so that the rhythmic pulse on which these works depend often breaks down. In the fast movements it's not so bad; his spontaneous, surging approach can produce superb effects. But in the slow movements he's much too stop-and-go for me, and some of the most important pieces on this disc are slow. If you like an individual approach to Mozart, but don't want Chopin, try Lilli Kraus."
5,Adrenaline,"Only one man colud do that i heart in this peace of work, the best arpho, since Homosapiens."
3,"Peel off letters, Made small","I have a petite Lab(55 lbs). I know pet clothes run small. I purchased the XL and the chest is made small. She wore it 3 times and the letters are starting to peel off. Its adorable but very cheaply made, similar to a cheap version of a human jersey"
4,Beatrice Di Tenda,"This was a new find for me. Having heard Gruberova in Fille de Regiment I selected this version of Bellini's opera. It is a soprono's tour de force and Gruberova does an oustanding job. It is a worthy addition to any opera collection. Seldom, if ever performed, it should be performed more often. The applause was a slight disappointment, but after listening to it, I felt like joining in. Heavy on choral with some tuneful arias.If you like baritones and soparanos, this is for you. I must confess that I now must hear the Sutherland performace, since she is quite an advocate of Bellini and this is a challenging assignment. She may have a sweeter voice than Gruberova. It is an enjoyable opera and may be worthy of two artists."
3,Works.,"This is a good product -- but I thought I would get more than one application with it -- and didn't. I much prefer Roebic's FOAMING root killer. It is a single use product, but it goes into the pipe and swells to the full diameter of the pipe to kill roots coming into the pipe from all directions. This product goes into the pipe and sits on the bottom and requires repeated flushing to get it all in."
5,Septic Woes,"Roebic root killer has done the job and saved us another visit from the ""Honeywagon."" Our lot is heavily wooded which has created problems with roots in our septic field. At the last visit from the ""Honeywagon"" we were advised to purchase a root killer. We checked Amazon and found the Roebic Root killer. So far it seems to be doing a good job with no back-up problems.The K-77 no longer seems to be available at Amazon. Might have to try another Roebic product and hope the results will be as good as that from the K-77.Roebic Laboratories, Inc. K-97-4 Main Line Cleaner, 32-Ounce"
5,Roebic is the only brand I use.,"My local store stopped carrying Roebic Root Killer so I was happy when I found it on Amazon. I've lived in my house since 1978 so the sewer line and I have a long-term relationship. During our first 10 years together, the sewer line became blocked with roots every couple of years. The blockage always occurred at the most inconvenient times (is there a convenient time?) and I'd be pressed to get a plumber to come out asap. The last plumber to clear the line told me to use Roebic Root Killer once a year. That was over 20 years ago and I haven't had a blocked sewer since (knock on wood)."
3,Works Somewhat,Directions call for its use twice per year for environmental reasons.Depends on the weather. I found that it must be used about twice that often.
5,Amazing Book,"This book is amazing. If you have ever wanted to learn more about Joseph Smith, this is the book. It is full of less known stories divided into several topics/chapters. I had the audio lectures by Truman G. before, but always wanted to find or quote parts and it was hard to find them on the cds... the book is perfect for this."
5,this book is when she is a mountainer nurse,"cherry ames,mountainer nurse is a very good book. She helps solve a mystery between two familys. The quarell has lasted for many many years tell cherry stepped in. I like mystery's so i really like this book I highly recomend this book."
1,Shallow book,"Bourne, an academic historian, apparently has not cared to do any original researches before writing this book, as it is based on published, secondary works and there is no bibliography at the end, surely a sign of something amiss, namely scholarship, analysis and judgement, a sad reflection on the author indeed."
5,Well built,This is a very nice and sturdy product. I love it! I was also very happy and surprised to find that it was much bigger than I thought it would be. Great buy!
5,Authentic Pigment Tote Bag,"Excellent. Roomy enough for my shopping, yet ""small"" enough to carry without endangering others. Strong and well-made too. Wonderful earthy pigment. Definitely a great purchase."
3,"pleased, for the most part","everything about this bag is great, except in the photo, it looks like the handles are canvas as well, but they're not. The size is good for a weekend trip, or anywhere you need a couple days worth of stuff. If you're good at packing things, you could fit about a week if you try."
1,Not a good buy.,"The bag looks cheap. The company did not inform me that the one I ordered was out of stock. After waiting almost a month I emailed them, that is when I was informed. I was given the option to pick another bag, that one arrived in about a week. It was quite a disappointment."
5,.it works,"A little bigger than we need because if you fill it, you drink it. But it hasn't broken yet and we've had it about a month"
5,"Oh sister where art thou'?,","Well i've finally got around to buying this album and boy why did i wait so long!! In parts pure western swing as in the opening number ""Roly Poly"" and sometimes downright ""barroom sleazy"" enough to make even Tom Waits crack a smile (see track 2 I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive with a vocal reminiscent of Rodney Crowell circa the ""Heartworn Highways"" period)this is a pure gem.As for Nora Jones taking lead vocal on their cover of ""Elvis's"" ""Love Me"" (as well as a couple of others) its as much shivers down the back time as the 1st time i saw her on Jools Hollands ""Later"" doing ""Cold Cold Heart""! The overall feel of this album though puts me in mind to watch ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou'"" again and conjures up Alison Krauss. Ok i'll cut this short as i'm listening to it again while i type and track 4's just started,nice....PS They also do an excellent cover of ""Gram Parsons"" ""Streets Of Baltimore"" and the closer ""Lou Reed"" just glows with affectionate humour."
1,Disappointing!,"I like Jazz... I like country... I like Norah Jones and have been waiting for a new album to come out... but the best way to sum up this effort is disappointing. Listening to this collection of songs, it's hard not to expect the polished smoothness that Norah and the Handsome Band has produced in the past but gone is the silky ""Norah Jones"" piano as well as the emotional feeling of the ""Handsome Band"". The recording is billed as friends who love to create together but the chemistry is all wrong. Some of the electric guitar work is good but Norah's playing is choppy and labored and the rhythm without feeling. Mix in the warbled crooning of Richard Julian and you have an amateurish night club act.Borrow the CD from your local library. That way you won't have to sell it in two weeks when you're tired of it."
1,Chilley Willies!,This CD was recommended with Norah Jones' new CD by Amazon so I took the advice and purchased it! Wrong!IT WAS AWFUL!!!!!
1,LESS THAN 1 STAR!!,Is Norah not satisfied with the money she has made by fooling everyone? This CD is slightly better than the others as there more talent involved with the other musicians.
5,Ear Candy Indeed,"What a pleasant surprise..ok, I'd probably pay to hear Norah Jones sing out of the Yellow Pages, but this whole CD should remind us that there is and was great American music, long before the Brtiish Invasion. I am not ""Country Music Fan"", but I thoroughly enjoy this disc...and it's hard to put a label on it, so perhaps that is the reason it is so refreshing. I was fortunate enough to hear them play live last Friday at the TLA in Philly - and their version of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" needs to be reocrded somewhere, as it was simply awesome. Anyway, do yourself a favor and give in to the Willies!"
3,Merle Haggard Once Did a Tribute Album to Bob Wills...,"I felt compelled out of necessity to add my comment that this album's kick-off track - ""Roly Poly"" - is, without a doubt, a tip of the hat to the great Bob Wills, the subject of Merle Haggard's 1970 release, A Tribute to the Best Damn Fiddle Player in the World. ""Roly Poly"" is track #9 on Merle's album, by the way. It is also worth noting that this style of music is known as Texas swing, not country & western. Norah Jones fans may or may not enjoy this record - it depends how open they are to other forms of pop music."
3,Easy Listening for a Summer's Night,"Imagine this: A country CD composed primarily of cover songs is released. The material is gently easygoing, pleasantly unexceptional. It's good-time music for a summer's night; you probably won't remember a single song the next day, but you will recall a general vibe of friendly twang and agreeably laid-back female vocals.That's this CD, and the only reason you've heard of it is because of Norah Jones. That is not a criticism; she's quite talented. And if you're a country music fan who doesn't have her hopes up too high, you'll like this project. Just don't expect to be ""wowed."""
5,Charming,"I love this CD! I am a big fan of Norah Jones, so based on a recommendation on this site, I bought it. Wonderful! The song ""Best of All Possible Worlds"" is one of the best here, but I was shocked to learn that it was written by Kris Kristofferson. I reevaluated after I learned, but I still like it."
4,Fun little retreat to the past,"This is so reminiscent of my childhood. Song styles of the past, very folksy, bluesy and sweet. I really enjoyed her selections and the vocal harmony."
4,Country Soul For The Dixie Chickens,"Released on my 43rd birthday - yippee! This is a gear laid back country soul album. Wondrous bluesy vocals, chill organ riffs, mellow guitar leads, nice dry drums, solid bass runs. Kudos to all the artists on this disc. This will be in the player a lot this year. Not bad for a one off album, thanks!"
3,A little on the weak side,"More country twang than I imagined with Richard Julian sounding a bit too much like Lyle Lovett, but the CD is fun just the same. Not that I mind Lyle Lovett, but Richard doesn't seem to have a voice of his own, unlike Norah who livens this CD up with her immediately recognizable vocals. Not sure what Cow Tipping has to do with Lou Reed, but Norah and Richard sound like they were having fun on this song. The CD is nicely packaged. Little in the way of liner notes, which makes this CD seem more like a lark than anything else. Hoping for something more substantial to come along soon."
2,Willies disappointment,A found this CD disappointing. The tracks seem too raw and a touch unprofessional.
2,"don't fool yourself, this is just cheap","A Norah Jones project, a great bunch of country songs. You'd think that this would be great. Think again. This is just another lame contemporary group soaking up the fame of Jones and using songs like Gotta Get Drunk as bait for fans of classic country. I can imagine this group playing at the ""Friends"" coffee shop. Good for the starbucks' crowd, bad for anyone who actually wants something whole and real to listen to. I compare this to elevator music: safe, pleasant, and boring.The worst part is that they cover several old country songs, famous for being the lonesome soul of those who sang them. Now they are processed, upbeat, weak and completly without emotion."
2,Promising film ruined by Bettany's dead energy,"I enjoyed the book by Barry Unsworth titled, ""Morality Play."" Although slight, it has a lot of atmosphere, fine writing and period detail. The main problem with the movie is in the casting. Willem Dafore is fine as the Player's leader, even though I would have preferred a British actor in the role. The rest of the cast add nothing to their underwritten parts. A charismatic lead might have compensated, but Paul Bettany is so utterly colorless that he drags the movie down until it is impossible for it to recover. Tedious!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A dull, stupid, and--above all--obvious murder mystery of a film, The Reckoning may intrigue you with the premise of a whodunnit set in medieval England, but the awful execution and ridiculous climax will be sure to diminish any interest you may have had: read the book (Barry Unsworth's ""Morality Play"") instead of wasting your time here."
3,Not a Family Movie,"I did enjoy this film and so far agree with the reviews thus far. But I also think it is important to point out that although it is a good movie and it does speak to the issue of good and evil for those who would notice it, it is also about a madman's preying on young boys and killing them. It is rated ""R"" for that reason and the graphic images."
4,Easy to get into and out of,"PROS + Beautiful cinematography, good casting, interesting plotCONS - Timing was sometimes off, sub-plots were underdevelopedThis was an enjoyable period piece with a decent plot and fine acting. Nothing more ... or less."
3,Let down by a stupid script,"It is very refreshing to see a film set in this era, this one was more authentic than many, though very far from perfect. Its small scale picture of life was also a very pleasant change from the usual historical mockbuster aimed at boosting some idiot actor/directors ego. What it let it down for me was the embarrassing script, so common in Hollywood movies also, which felt as if it was written by an intelligent sixteen year old who doesn't get out much."
4,modern day morality play/murder mystery set in the middle ages,"I enjoyed this movie. Paul Bettany and Willam Dafoe gave good performances and the story was good. I was a little confused by the flash-backs at the beginning, especially since you don't get the full story of what is really happening in the flash-backs until the end of the movie. I had never heard of this movie before, but has glad that I tried it. The mystery isn't bad either."
3,Avoid if you have shiny-face anyway....,"I have wanted this in Pink Quartz for so long! Finally ordered some, and it's going back. Bahhhh what a disappointment!I'm pale pasty white, and have to fight shine all day as it is. I did my usual routine, and this on top just gave me a 'shine', not a 'glow'. I should have known better after seeing how others mention 'bronzer' and 'glow'. Glow means shine as far as my skin is concerned. It also looked a little 'pasty' in the areas I applied it (with a HUGE blush brush so I did not over-apply) after a couple of hours.EDIT: Try Smashbox Baked Starburst instead! (And it's cheaper!)Smashbox Fusion Soft Lights Baked Starburst"
3,Alice in Acidland/Smoke and Flesh,classic midnight movie and as most of these type movies they go over the top
2,Transparent and disappointing,"As a long-time reader of this series, I was disappointed with this latest effort. The Romanov connection seemed pretty predictable. I didn't understand why their first question wasn't 'How did an unassuming pastry chef amass an estate of over 2 million dollars?' And without the pre-trial investigation we usually get from Nina and Paul, all of our encounters with the trial witnesses were pretty superficial. While I like that Nina is a smart, independent, strong woman, it disappoints me that she's too rigid to allow an equally smart, independent, strong male in her life. I haven't seen much character growth for Nina during the life of this series, and I really didn't need to see her reject Paul one more time. Get those 2 together, for crying out loud, or let it go. Personally, I think the O'Shaughnessy's should consider dropping Nina and giving Paul his own series."
1,Very disappointing!!,"I loved the Nina O'Reilly series but, was disappointed with this book. Nina comes across as so weak and as a doormat. Allowing Paul to force her into wearing his ring while she decides on his proposal and then not calling him on humiliating her set her up as a doormat. She wears her ring to court to question his ex-lover and then finds out from a mutual friend, Ginger, that he slept with his ex but, she doesn't confront him, pretending that nothing has happened while continuing to wear his ring. It amazed me that two women wrote this book. Who would put up with that? The fact that she later goes dancing with him and allows him his ""we're adults and I thought you'd understand"" line floored me."
4,Difficult Decision,"UNLUCKY IN LAW by Perri O'Shaughnessy is a tense legal thriller staring Nina Reilly. She leaves her home to help with a murder trial in Monterey County, California. This move gives her time to spend with her boy-friend P.I. Paul van Wagoner, but her son Bob hates his new school and Paul has given her a ring, which she isn't sure she wants.Is her old boss, Klaus Pohlmann slipping as a trial lawyer? Nina is pitched into the fight to save a young man from life imprisonment with little or no preparation. She and Paul aren't even getting much help from the other member of the law firm, but she pulls her wandering emotions together and prepares to do her best because she believes her client when he tells her he is not guilty.This story has twists and turns as old secrets work their way thru the mire of the past.Nash Black, author of Indie award finalists, WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."
2,A Mess,"This story takes a long time to get to the point with a sputtering payoff. I found it difficult to be sympathetic to any of these characters because they are all so pathetic. An admitted grave robber is not sympathetic. Nina can't decide between her job, sex life of son. Willing to break any laws to get her client off. Really kind of sleazy look into the mind of defense attorneys. Yuk."
3,Not as good as her earlier works,"I have been a fan of this series from the beginning. ""Unlucky in Law"" seems to be a stretch to find an unusual plot but rehashing the mystery of the Russian dynasty didn't work for me. The twist of the DNA found at the crime scene was used on CSI earlier this year so that wasn't a surprise either.Nina is busy with the case and and the same time trying to decide where her life is headed and whether or not it includes Paul. Her unwillingness to commit to him over the duration of most of this series has told us all along where their relationship was headed. Of course it is easier for her to dump him when Paul strays.It's not a totally terrible addition to the series but it is certainly not the best. I look forward to the next entry and hope that Nina back in Tahoe without Paul will bring some excitement back into what has been, for the most part, a good series."
2,Let down ending,"This book started off very well, fascinating story, and kept my interest most of the way, but it came apart in the final fourth part. One is left twirling at the complexity of the case, plus the upheavel in Nina's ralationship with Paul. He's been hanging on for what? nine years. He deserves better."
3,Nina's saga,"Fairly slow and uninteresting at the begining, but picked up the pace later onPaul is a hunk, who will Nina's heart pick now?The saga continues..."
5,Looks stylish and nice,Its a perfect watch for people who dont like a lot of shiny stuff.The black and grey combination with very little sparkle looks very descent and nice.
3,"A friend of mine knew victoria, I felt like I knew her","This book chronicals victoria's battle with cancer, but focuses more on the technical aspects of what happened as opposed to her emotions and feelings about her struggle. It is mostly a list of food she ate, drugs she was administered, places she went, and so on. However, her father, Thomas, expressed his feelings as best he could and made tribute to his daughter publicly-to be commended for one who has lost a daughter. The book is highly detailed and realistic, lacking in romantic flowerly prose one has come to expect from tributary works. The end of the book left me in tears, almost wishing I could read mopre into the life of victoria. While much of who she was is shown in the book, one can't help but feel a good part of her personality was left unsaid. the novewl sheds a realistic light on the hurrendous effects of cancer without playing up on romanticism."
4,~ Movie's Cool...I Grew Up There !,"The movie was cool. It would have been better if the film people showed more of Barstow: Del Taco, the Sports Park or Dana park, Old Mall, Skyline Drive-In Movies & more of East Main Street.I grew up in Yermo & Barstow. No real opportunities there. A lot of drugs & the town's not improving. I was happy when I left. The only things I miss about the high desert is my family, clean weather & Del Taco."
5,Florida Atlas and Gazetteer,"Easy to read and use, invaluable when traveling in city or hiking in rural areas. Very detailed, provides names of area sites that are interesting to stop by, which are not included on road maps."
3,Not what I was looking for....,"Don't expect a road map or a detailed topographic map either. Granted, Florida doesn't have much topography, but what little it does isn't even covered by this map. It's one good point is the comprehensive list of things to do in the state, but as a map, it misses the mark."
3,Florida Atlas and Gazetteer (Florida Atlas & Gazetteer),A bit difficult to handle (size). Good enough to use in your car.
1,This atlas is useless,"Delorme did a useless job on the Florida atlas, the side roads are not named at all. The main roads are named and what good is that. This is the worst map that I have encountered from Delorme. I would not recommend it to anyone. I would like my 19.95 plus Florida tax back on this atlas."
4,Very Good Close to Ideal,Found it a little large as it will be used on a motor bike but very detailed and what i wanted. only product I found
2,Disappointing,"Out of date, missing newer attractions, lists stuff that hasn't been open for years, difficult to use, no index. An entire page of blue featureless Atlantic Ocean! My own street and all those in the area are nowhere to be found, but hey, we've only been here thirty years. I guess it will be of some use to keep in the car in case my ipad runs out of juice. Too much trouble to send it back, or I would."
5,A Big Help On Vacation,This Atlas was recommended by an outdoor photographer who lives in Florida. My husband and I constantly referred to it before and during a recent vacation in Florida and found it a good starting point for further internet searches. We used the maps and guides in the Atlas. I would highly recommend it if you are planning a trip to Florida and will be driving to several locations in the state.
4,Where to go to scratch the outdoors itch.,"I often refer to several of the books in this series when planning an outdoor adventure in an unfamiliar area. for kayakers like me, they identify public boat ramps, mountain bike, and hiking trails. Your GPS may help you find the place, but the Delorme will tell you where to go."
2,LACKS OF DETAILED STREET NAMES,"I use this book occasionally, but it is lacks the detailed for use by itself. Where I do use it is with mapquest, that tends to not show the smaller lakes, but the Gazetteer does a much better job."
1,Waste of paper and my money...,If you have internet access and I assume you do as you are reading these words you do not need this Gazetteer. I bought this hoping to come up with ideas to head out and metal detect but wow is it a waste. Labeling is next to nothing and what little topography Florida does have this manages to ignore as well. Just spend some time with Google Maps and you will be much better served.
3,A classic of its type,"Pinker wrote this book in the late 90s and it presents his early views on the computational brain and studies on complex cognitive operations of the brain. it also presents his evolutionary approach to thinking about psychology. The book is dated by more recent work, and does not incorporate important developments in the use of imaging. Mostly of interest as a classic presentation of a point of view."
1,DO NOT buy for Kindle,"The book itself is pretty good (very interesting!), at least the part I read is. I didn't get too far into it, though, because the Kindle formatting was so awful! It's not properly formatted at all. The text has obviously been cheaply scanned into the computer and converted into an ebook.. and they didn't even scan it from a clean copy of the book! There are little distracting marks all over the pages! When highlighting, the curser often skips lines because the lines aren't quite straight. The spacing between the lines is also highly inconsistent, with often two lines smushed together and then the next two an inch apart.And it costs $9.99! That's nearly as much as the paperback version ($11.79) - and that's an actual physical book! Completely ridiculous.So basically I threw away $10 for a barely readable ebook. Don't make my mistake. DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION."
2,Anyone could review the literature in the field,"If you are looking for a general review of the literature in the field and some comments about the work of those who practice science then this is the book for you! Of course, this is his strong point. If you want current, up to date and original work in the field look elsewhere."
2,Same old mistakes.,"...At the end, however, Pinker writes an authoritative and comprehensive book, that makes many brilliant points, and argues for some plausible evolutionary psychology. I recomend it because it is a classic in the field allready, and a good read. But the computer methaphor is not an easy position to hold with today's modern neuroscience research..."
3,Thought provoking ideas but dull reading,"There are lots of stimulating ideas in the book. However, the computational discussion is too wordy / rambling. Discusses simple computational concepts in a boring detailed way with numerous illustrative examples. This forced me to skip pages often and the reading experience wasn't as pleasant. My masters thesis was in artificial intelligence 12 years ago - so, this opinion may be biased."
2,Not enough,"As I'm not that good with the english language I'll be brief. If you have read ANYTHING about the brain and it's ability to function as it does, this book doesn't add anything! The theories he favors doesn't always make sense or perhaps I'm just dense. As I have plowed through some other literature on this subject, I hope not... Anyways, please try some other books on this difficult subject to get better insight."
4,A wonderful piece of science writing,"OK, so it was a bit long. But I thought Pinker wrote persuasively, coherently and best of all lucidly. His metaphors were apt and useful, and his use of language great. I found the book to be much better than The Language Instinct because of the ease of reading - true, it might be one-sided, in that Pinker was putting forward his best argument for the evolutionary model, but that is to be expected in a book (rather than a peer-reviewed paper). I suspect the polarized opinion concerning this book is more to do with the assumptions people brought to their reading than it is what was actually written."
2,Still fails to elucidate the phenomona of consciousness,"I read this book in high hopes that it might make a strong case that consciousness is an emergent phenomona. This book, like all the other materialist explanations to date, still fails to explain the actual phenomonology (the root) of consciousness. David Chalmers book, ""The Conscious Mind"", makes a better case that consciousness is better explained as a fundamental ,not an emergent property. On the other hand, Pinker does an outstanding job of describing the *structure* of consciousness and its evolutionary origins."
2,Read Deacon instead.,"If you think Pinker may have something to teach you in either ""How the Mind Works"" or ""The Language Instinct"", skip both and order the remarkable book by Terrence Deacon, ""The Symbolic Species"". Unlike Pinker, who still pays homage to Chomsky, Deacon respectfully turns Chomsky's notion on its head and in so doing, suggests (and teaches) a revolutionary idea of how the mind really works."
3,Castles Made of Sand,"An interesting and plausible approach to understanding the currently incomprehensible. ""How the Mind Works"" is a well-stated and fun to read exposition of the ineffable. Be wary of brains expressing certainty about the organization and causes of themselves. Making statements with confidence about this fledgling subject reveals something unsettling about brain function. Look for Pinker and others to re-architect their castles as the next wave of understanding sweeps across neurology, physics, computing, evolution and the glue that binds these disciplines into a consistent flow of ideas."
5,Best book writen in the last few years,"If you wish to understand the way humans really work, read this book. The most brilliant summary in years. Go Dna!!"
2,Some modesty is in place,"Mr. Pinker states his case quite well (though he repeats his ideas over and over again in the book) . The ideas themselves are not new, but the evidence he gives for them is interesting. That said, some modesty would not be out of place. To Mr. Pinker, how the brain works is almost clear, but if only things were so simple ... Also, some more serious references to other opinions (such as Mr. Penrose's) are in order."
1,"I'm no intellectual, but ...","I tried to read this book, but I was stopped cold when Mr. Pinker declared that there was no such thing as a soul. Outside of any religious sense, I still fail to see how he comes to this conclusion, and how he can justify it. By the use of convoluted logic, I suppose. He is arrogant enough to declare himself an authority; but I remember the real authority Leo Buscaglia saying ""I met many PhD's. When I left the man who had worked with me (in getting his license), I told him 'Call me if you ever need help.'""Just my humble opinion."
1,The Blind Programmer,Don't be seduced by Pinkermania; he's trapped in a little box and he won't be taking a look around anytime soon. Edward Oaks couldn't have said it better in his review:http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft9803/articles/oakes.html
2,Lacks spirituality,"This book focuses too much on the material basis for our consciousness, without examining the spiritual drivers of our consciousness as given to us by God.God created us in his image, so that we could love him as he loved us. He therefore gave us consciousness and language so that we could praise his name. THAT is how the mind, and spirit, works."
2,"""Body Heal Thyself, Oh, Please !""","I too, have read a great number of books about the mind, body, and, spirit, but ""How The Mind Works"" by Steven Pinker, is a real STINKER ! The book clearly takes home the grand prize in the ""HOG-WASH"" department ! Textbook of the mind, oh please, people wake up and smell the coffee beans in Brazil ! Sterograms, (magic eye pictures), general visualation, music, art, emotions, religion, sex, humor, and philosophy, (I don't think so, Mr. Pinker!) One would better off slapping oneself upside the side of one's head and being done with it! Back to the real world folks, what a crock of...!"
4,interesting book about how the mind Could! work,"I dont have much to add to the other reviews, only that if you want to know something about our brain, our mind, about how unique life is etc, this book is one to read, just like Chance and Necessity is, or the Anthropic Cosmological Principle, to give some examples.His style of writing is, as a review put is, as scientific writing should be: witty, erudite, and clear. the facts, and his conclusion about them are good reading, and at the end it leaves enough space to make up your mind yourself. You will be sure not to agree with all in it, but you will definitely read some facts about human nature you never thought of like that before: and you keep them for the rest of your life, not bad for a few dollars!"
5,Why We Do (or Want to Do) What We Do.,"By the end, Steven Pinker's ""How the Mind Works"" had my mind working on overdrive, fascinated with his evolutionary explanations of phenomena such as male promiscuity, friendship, and altruism. He takes care to assure us that these evolutionary tendencies do not necessarily make us blind agents of genetic dispositions. If his suppositions are correct, however, they are useful in helping us to recognize the basis of our worst impulses and see the benefit of listening to the better angels of our nature."
4,Evolution and computation,"Though this is a long book that doesn't feel very cohesive, it is still a fascinating read. It is almost a philosophy book, albeit one that uses scientific ideas to explain how we behave and why we do so. The central premise is that we evolved, and because we evolved, our brains are products of natural selection. The first half of the book explains how this is possible, and how the brain itself processes information in various ways. The second half is probably more interesting to most readers (including me), but only because the discussion on how the brain operates changes to a discussion on our instincts and desires, with a great chapter on relationships with other people. It is at times tedious to read, but it's not a difficult textbook (almost pop-cog-sci) so if you're interested in cognitive science, you might enjoy it."
1,very little substance,I bought the book based on the reviews here and I am very disappointed. I found myself reading many pages and still can't get any new insight out of it. How could this book get all these wonderful reviews? I am amazed.
2,"Very long, not for everyone, but reaffirms Romantic Pre","Conceptions.This is a funny read, if you know any actual cognitive theory. So close and yet so far! It is almost as if 'How the Mind Works' is a propaganda tract of the Scienologists.It is that corrosive and detremental to the actual study of the brain (ignored, as religious freaks do) and natural selection (often ignored, as for example the weirdos think man evolved through bivalve clam life-forms)Buy it as a joke, like you all do Dianetkics or whatever that other silly stuff is."
2,Pretentious and ultimately useless,"There's no denying that Pinker is an entertaining writer. You might be annoyed if you start to feel that he's trying to juggle too many conceptual balls at once. The danger is that his charm may make you overlook the vacuousness of his evolutionary pronouncements. Does he really think each of the many ""algorithms"" he says are needed for our intelligence and consciousness fortituously arrived miraculously as needed? Doesn't he understand the biological and molecular complexity required for even the ""simplest"" algorithms to be programmed into matter? And the difficulties involved not only in the absence of these programs, but in the many failed attempts that must have preceded? His ""just-so"" evolutionary scenarios and ""explanations"", vague as can be, are no substitute for science, and are totally useless.Perhaps he will reconsider after reading Behe's ""Darwin's Black Box"" ... but that would take a more open mind. One can only hope."
1,Come on!,"The reason big brains are presumably a good evolutionary bet is that they really do provide genuine flexibility in dealing with a changing world (changing in large part due to our big brains I should add). Yes, we have a ""human nature"" as any reasonable person knows (even if they say differently in their academic circles, they live their lives, I'll bet, as if they realize this), but Pinker's excessively glib talk, poorly considered examples, and leanings toward everything we do as being ""innate""is just ludircous and naive. What the heck does he mean when he suggests X,Y,or Z is innate he never says. After all, we ain't born doing any of it so when/where/how/ by what definition is it innate?If we were as hard-wired as Pinker likes to make it sound (and I think he is just fighting for fun) we'd probably be an extinct species by now. Also, please learn some biology, Dr. Pinker. It really will help you formulate an intelligent view of how we work."
1,Get to the point!,This was another Pinker book I couldn't finish. If he was a taxi-driver he would take you from Brooklyn to New York via San Francisco. Sometimes even his asides have asides! Perhaps like pulp fiction writers he gets paid by the word.
5,Hello evolutionary psychology; goodbye Freud & religion,"A slam-dunk. This book, along with other books in the evolutionary psychology line, have the effect of making you realize that the earth is not the center of the universe. It's exhilirating and revolutionary. Not for the faint of heart (see all the negative reviews in this list)."
2,Disappointing! Pinker did not try hard here.,"I was a psychology and biology major in college and am innately interested in brain research, so Pinker's thesis sounded fascinating. But the book is not; it is boring, and I could not finish it. Pinker wrote this very casually, it is not a rigorous study and does not cover really very much material. Instead, it is more a narrative, a transcript of Pinker thinking out loud. This is one of those occasions I really regretted the high cost of a hardback.A friend studied cognitive science (really a subfield of psych, with a lot of computer science mixed in) at MIT, so I passed the book along to him. He later confessed he became bored and put it away. His honesty about my mediocre gift confirmed my suspicions. This is not a good book, although it may entertain some who are new to the field. Even if you are new to psych, however, there are much better places to start."
5,An excellent book if you are interested in mind mechanics.,"I really enjoyed this book---it was hard to put down. It's educational and gives the feeling of being in a really fun classroom teaching mind mechanics. It would be a good idea, however, to have a dictionary nearby. Mr. Pinker is highly educated and a few words might be unfamiliar to some people. I hope it comes out on tape and soon."
2,I still don't know how the mind works,"Being an electrical engineer who knows how computers store data in silicon, I thought that a book called ""How the mind works"" would at least teach me how meat stores data. Well, not here. The segment about vision is quite interesting, but most of the text focuses on software. I was also disappointed with his style: by often mixing robust models with shallow speculations, I soon couldn't distinguish the two. Maybe the book is more impressive for those who haven't read Richard Dawkins or Robert Wright."
3,simplistic,"As far as I know, in America today no other writer on psychology possesses the remarkable power of exposition that Pinker does. He is indeed the ideal popularizer, and it is no surprise that his books sell so well. What the general reader doesn't know, however, is how much he simplifies and distorts the picture by a peculiar principle of selection--waving away everything that contradicts what he has to say and embracing anything that supports his theories. This plus his remarkable ignorance of neurobiology create a very narrow-minded and biased account of the topics he does discuss. Therefore, although I am a supporter of the computational and evolutionary approach advocated in this book, I would in fact urge beginning readers to avoid reading it. Much of HOW THE MIND WORKS is pure sophistry, designed to sway the reader to his side via rhetoric, not science. Readers beware."
4,Food for thought...,"It's a tall task: Pinker attempts to give an overview of the evidence supporting computational theory. He strikes a good balance of necessary simplification and comprehensive treatment of his subject. His frank disclosures about his own viewpoints are appropriately prominent (a point some of the other reviewers seem to have overlooked). But the main point is that Pinker provides an interesting, provocative, and at times disturbing theory. As an avid consumer of popular science literature, I applaud that."
3,"A challenging, yet thought-provoking read","I did think this was too long. 'The Language Instinct' was perfectly pitched, and this didn't quite match it. I shall assume you're interested in cognitive theories of mind, if you are then its worth getting to grips with. His emphasis on computational neural networks is spot on, we at thehub.com are aiming to articulate their relevance to attention/arousal and consciousness. As well as integrate them with the established neurophysiology and neurochemistry of attentional problems. Come.to/thehub.com if you're interested."
1,"good cognitive science, very fuzzy biology","How the Mind Works shows what happens when a solid scholar in one field becomes enamored of another. Pinker is a wonderful writer and very effective when explaining language; but his understanding and feel for evolutionary biology are truly shallow, and his resorts to adaptation are usually simplistic that they read like a college term paper. So the book is very much a mixed bag."
3,In and Out of his element,"Steven Pinker certainly knows his stuff when it comes to how our brain works. If you have the endurance and are a scientist already, you may get through this incredibly monotonous book. He is able to comprehend the mechanics of how the human mind works, but flops when it comes to drawing any meaningful implications. His views about religion and philosophy are stale and hackneyed. While his discussions about the biology of the brain and its varied mechanisms are within his expertise, his discussions of religion and philosophy are shallow and un-thoughtful-bordering upon arrogance. I would still recommend the book; it is better than counting sheep!"
5,Great REading,"Pinker is funny, entertaining and rational. One of the great reading about mind and human behaviors. Must read it."
2,poor on many levels,"The author is neither an expert in neuroscience or philosophy of mind and it shows. His good ideas are not original and many of his original ideas are just wrong. I tried one of his examples out on my boss a professor at Yale and he came to the very conclusion that Pinker says we would not come to while he is trying to illustrate how our minds do not work. So much for that. Also many examples and ideas stollen from other arthors. If you want to learn neuroscience get a good text. If you are interested in the mind try Dennet and Chalmers, philosophers. This psychologist isn't going to help you dig very deep.The book is also poorly written and edited."
2,What a Waste of a good Subject,"If you're looking for a straight forward, honest appraisal on how your mind processes thought, remembers, recalls , analysis and determines what's fact and fiction, ect.., then forget this book.If, however, you're looking for a not so well thought out argument on Natural selection, Darwinism, and little green men mixed in with a few sentences on the mind, then this the book you want.On page 60 and page 159 he makes two major errors and that pretty much destroy any hope of a solid foundation for his book to build upon.There are about 50 pages of useful information in this book, but you have to wade through so much garbage it's hard to justify the effort.Basically, it appears the author could not stay focused on the subject of the mind and wander off into evolution, computers and outer space."
2,Dissapointing,"I found this book to be lackluster and quite disappointing. The author is essentially using the text to launch an attack against humanistic ideas within the social sciences, unfortunately (or fortunately if you *are* a humanist) his arguments are quite weak, and generally set up and attack straw men. The theories he does propose turn out to be (as other reviewers have stated) faulty interpretations of computer science, and it is clear that the author does not understand the ideas that he is so vehemently attacking."
2,Oh for goodness sake...,"Pinker says,""How can my actions be a choice for which I am responsible if they are completely caused by my genes, my upbringing, and by brain state.""The quantum uncertainty principle, which science widely accepts, precludes any kind of absolute deterministic universe. As a result, we are indeed responsible for our actions and there is indeed free will and free choice.Sorry Steve.Sincerely,Another Steve."
2,Unable to Finish,Very dry style. This book was unable to keep my interest. Perhaps my own fault. Will try again another day.
2,"important subject, yet so boring","I was drawn to this book because I'm interested in the issue of cultural identity of immigrants and their descendants. The subject of the book is an important one and I admired the author's brutal honesty. However, it has to be said that this just isn't a book that compels you to keep reading (not for me, anyway). We read about countless, mostly banale conversations in bars, and the book's 'revelatory insights' are underwhelming to say the least. There are a few interesting nuggets but they are few and far between. I'm not quite sure why I waded through the whole thing."
2,"Written in 1991, very dated now","I agree with the reviewers who found the book repetitive, a little boring and more about his family than Japanese culture. While he attempts to provide many insights I fear that most of them are dated now 16 years later. Also the author makes such a big deal about seeing the hometown of his grandfather and when he finally gets there after 300 pages there is absolutely no payoff."
1,Bad times ten,"An overwraught and overwritten diary about how hard it is to be David Mura, wealthy American of Japanese descent. Hello? Hard lives are lived on the West Bank, in drought-striken East Africa and in Northern Ireland. This self-indulgent work trivializes real suffering."
4,Analog is the way to go for a sub $100 bathroom scale,"This scale is fairly solid, and has a nice large dial. I like that it doesn't imply false precision the way that the inexpensive digital scales that proliferate the market do (trust me, scales that can give tenth of a pound precision up to 300 pounds do not cost $30). The other advantage of this and other analog scales is that you can tell when you're balanced properly because of the way that the dial settles. With the digital bathroom scales that I've used, you get a locked in snapshot of how much gravitational force you were putting on the scale at a particular moment, and it's hard to know whether or not you were balanced during that moment. This scale does not have that issue."
2,Too bulky...hard to read,This is a real bulky scale and is can be difficult to read from a distance.
1,Very disappointed,"I bought this scale a month ago, hoping to get a scale that would finally be consistent. This mechanical scale replaced a digital scale that would jump 30 pounds in 10 seconds. When I first got the scale, it looked very sturdy and it performed accurately (I tested it with a hand weight) and consistently for a couple of weeks. Something happened to the machanics, and now the scale will not stay at zero, and maxes out at 80 pounds. I weigh considerably above 80 and now have another door stop in my bathroom and no way to get an accurate weight. Does anyone know of a good scale?"
5,super scale,"after all the inexpensive scales bought, i now have an accurate scale that can be adjusted. it is larger, but well worth it!"
5,LOVE this scale!!,"This scale is great! We have a digital scale in my house also and I would always be so frustrated with it because I could get on the scale get one number, step off and get on again a second later and get a completely different number. Our digital scale has all these fancy features like a body fat calculator etc. but it isn't helpful if you cannot get a consistent, accurate weight measurement. This scale however is extremely accurate, I consistently get the same number even when stepping on & off several times. It also looks great in my bathroom and is super easy to re-set if I ever have to move it around. You simply get it home, remove it from the box, set the dial to ""0"" and step on and off a few times to get it activated. It's so simple! It's also extremely durable. & I received it in two days with free shipping! I highly recommend this scale!"
5,"Salter 200 Academy Professional Mechanical Scale, White and Gray","The scale is well constructed, solid, and the weight figures are easy to read. I regard this as a very satisfactory purchase."
3,I've upgraded the review a bit,"Perhaps my initial review was a tad harsh. It seems to work OK, though the setting dial in the front is apparently easy to accidentally brush against and add a few lbs by bumping the scale the wrong way.Overall, it's a good scale, but too darn big. It doesn't fit in the corner between the sink and the wall - where every other scale I ever bought fit.I have mixed feelings on every digital scale I bought, so I tried this, and it works, but for some reason, I just don't like it very much - and it doesn't fit in my bathroom corner. Not awful, but I kinda regret buying it."
5,Perfect scale,"I'm very pleased with this scale, it is very nice with enough room to stand on and good view to the dial that make it it easy to read. it was shipped well protected and on time. Having a tracking no. made it easy to predict the time and date of arrival."
3,Accurate scale although step mat too small,The scale is accurate however the mat to step on is too small if you wear size 11 or greater shoes. The face of the scale is easy to read with big numbers however it is a challenge to maneuver your feet getting placed on the scale mat.
5,Accurate Scales,I purchased the scales about 2 months ago. These scales have remained accurate and are easy to read. They fit in a corner in the bedroom and I weigh myself about every three days. I definitely recommend them.
4,Excellent Scale.,"Very Accurate, easy to read numbers. Weight in one lb increments. Quite Large (not good for small spaces). Durable-do not expect that it will need replacing."
2,Not worth the money,"It's a decent scale except it's not worth the money. It has two major deficiencies:First, it's inaccurate like most scales. Step on it five times and get five different weights. It's not off by much, maybe 1-3 pounds. In my book that isn't acceptible. I bought it for the accuracy and was disappointed.Second, you can't read the weight displayed! I'm 6' and my wife 5' 5"". Neither of us could read our weights because the scale is too hard to read. You've got to bend over and squint to read the measurement and of course bending over changes the weight. Very frustrating. I bought the scale to measure my weight. What good is it if you can't read your weight?I returned the scale."
3,Small weight increments,"While I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the Salter scale, the space between pounds is just too tiny. I want to know if I've gained or lost smaller increments of weight, such as a half pound or quarter pound. Some company should make scales that range from 0-200 instead of 300 so that larger spaces between pounds would be possible. The Salter scale is also rather large."
1,Arrived broken. Poor quality.,"This scale arrived broken. The plastic dial was loose and the dial to adjust scale wouldn't budge. The package was not adequately protected from breakage. They simply put the scale in it's original box into a slightly larger brown box with a little paper to cushion. No wonder it arrived broken.The scale seemed very cheap, made of materials that aren't made to last long. Plastic primarily."
1,Save your money!,I could not calibrate no matter how hard I tried. Key was loose and dial was too touchy. NOT A PROFESSIONAL scale at all.
2,Inaccruate,"Weighed myself just before a doctors appointment. The scale showed 204 with clothing. Was weighed 20 minutes later at the doctors office with the same clothes...195. I thought I was buying a ""Professional Scale"", instead i purchased something less.would not recommend this scale."
2,can't see it,"Gave it away, didn't like it because I can't see the little lines in between the whole numbers. Its huge and bulky and my size 11 feet didn't fit well on it either."
3,Great buy but weak,It broke after I stood on it. Im 320lbs and the thing cracked after standing on it. SUCKS dbro
2,not what I wanted,"The packaging was great; both easy to open and securely keeping the product undamaged during shipping. However, when I got the product out I was disappointed. It is not especially pretty... I know, maybe not the most important thing... but also, it goes up to 400 lb. Since everyone in my household is well under 200 lb we didn't need the extra capacity, but also, having the dial go up that high makes the numbers small, relatively, when you are looking down at the dial, so it ends up being hard to read. It seemed like a pretty accurate scale and no need for batteries, simple mechanism that works, but in the end I opted for a prettier looking one and one without the high capacity."
1,Another Item Made in China,"This scale talks about ""Professional"" it's another made in China piece of junk!! Don't waste your money."
1,DAMAGED IN TRANSIT,"I RECEIVED THESE THE OTHER DAY AND TO MY HORROR THEY ARE COMPLETELY DAMAGED! I HAVE NOT REMOVED THEM FROM THE PLASTIC MANUFACTURER'S SEAL AS I COULD SEE THE DIAL WAS ALL SMASHED UP, THEY WERE CLEARLY SHIPPED DAMAGED! I NEEDED SO SCALES URGENTLY SO WENT TO WALMART AND BOUGHT SOME I WOULD LIKE A RETURNS LABEL SO I CAN SEND THESE BACK IMMEDIATELY BUT THESE ARE VERY HEAVY AND I DO NOT WANT TO PAY FOR DEFECTIVE GOODS TO BE RETURNED! I WOULD LIKE THIS RESOLVED ASAP AS I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY BACK A VERY UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!"
3,For better eyes than mine,I have difficulty reading the numbers on the scale as they are too close together to read easily at a normal height.
3,"Works, bulky, has a wierd key in the bottom.","1. It works.2. It's bulky and you'd think the design would have became a little more contemporary after all these years.3. It wouldn't zero out right out of the box so I tried to stand on it to use it. It has a small subtle wierd key in the bottom which ""popped"", tilted, jammed, and got stuck in it as soon as I put weight on it. This REALLY messed up the scales zero point. The key is not mentioned in the instructions at all. I had to twist it with pliers to get it out. Then was able to get to a zero point and now the scale works fine. Still no idea why there is/was a key on the bottom and if it was supposed to be be removed before use. There were no warning stickers attached."
2,Lifeless rocking,"Time has not been kind to this oversimplified power chord femme rock, churning along with a dumbed-down menace that does little to highlight decently personal vocals."
5,The Viennese Pastry Cookbook review,"I bought my first Viennese Pastry Cookbook more than 30 years ago and at the time bought a copy for my mother. Later I bought copies for my grown children and a neighbor. Being born in Austria, I could really identify with the cryptic recepies that were the basis of the book, and what's more: the pastries are wonderful. Too bad the later (paper back) does not include Lilly Joss Reich's photos that were in the hardcover book."
1,Disapppointing,"Splitting up the Companions of the Hall worked in ""Streams of Silver"" and ""The Halfling's Gem"" but it doesn't here. It's just not as much fun and Drizzt's romance with the utterly boring Cattie-Brie is as interesting as watching maggots mate. The orcs are lame enemies compared to Artemis Entreri and the drow. Re-read The Icewind Dale trilogy instead."
1,Trash,I dont understand all the excitment over this series and this author. Most of the story is very contrived. So many stupid things happen ( A female scoops up a massive barbarian under her arm???)that it is hard to take anything written in a serioues way. There is a dwarf named DAGNABBIT? A sword named Twinkle? Another named Icingdeath? Does it drown you in icing?The plot has holes you can drive a truck through and the writing is 4th grade level..
1,Most boring piece Salvatore ever created,"Starting with the Dark Elf Trilogy this drow's adventures really kept me good company for years. My all time favorite work of the author is the Dark Elf Trilogy and I read all the other adventures of Drizzt. Thousand Orc series however , have been sending alarm signals that Drizzt and Co. have finally come to an end. What was most interesting about Drizzt in the beginning was his inner reflection and diary-like musings. Unfortunately it grew old and boring and he became a whining self rightous character. The plot is more like a cheap soap opera: There is no plot at all. You can tell that many pages and dialogues and Drizzt's self reflection moments are just there to fill the pages.It is time for bob Salvatore to pull the plug on this guy and create something else. This book is written mainly due to financial concerns of the author.I agree with the previous posters recommendations. Storyline and characters need to mature."
4,An Excellent middle adventure for this series...,"After waiting with much anticipation for this book, I was not disappointed. Salvatore creates an intriguing deviation and his unique blend of battle action and saga will have you turning page after page. Salvatore's writing style can, at times, be a cold slap in the face and maybe even frustrating for some readers. But over all this trilogy is definatly positioning itself as his best work yet. Highly entertaining and recommended. Bring on ""The Two Swords"" !!!Justice Delivered"
2,Only read if your dead set on reading the whole trilogy,"Ever read a book that you thought was interesting enough to warrant reading the sequel? Then you read the sequel and it's one of the most pointless books you've ever read? That more or less is what The Lone Drow is like. Thousand Orcs was good enough to warrant me to read the sequel. But for some reason I just did not like this book at all. For some reason I just didn't find the writing style all that captivating, and the characters were just sort of dull to me. There are exceptions to this, I like the characters of Obould and Drizzt (when he wasn't whining that is). Overall the book isn't all that enjoyable, only read it if your intent on reading the whole trilogy. Otherwise if you want to read a Salvatore book I recommend Promise of the Witch King or the vastly superior book (in this trilogy anyway) The Two Swords."
4,Another Wonderful Book,I keep stalling the finish of the book to make it last longer. I have not found one book in this series that I have not enjoyed. I am looking forward to reading the next installment. I would recommend this book to any Drizzt fan.
3,Plenty of action and generic protagonists,"This book is much like your typical popcorn action movie. It has violence and action in every chapter but the every character is two dimensional and very overpowered. Every hero is basicly a one-man-army and rarely thinks of creative ways to beat their opponents. The story line isn't very deep so don't expect a whole lot of twists or surprise endings to the series. The storline also revolves around dwarves which I couldn't really relate to nor did I find them all that interesting but you probably won't have a problem with that. Overall the series is kindof fun to read, they're not painful reads but they arn't works of are either."
5,Love It!,"I have always loved Salvatore's writing style (and really believe he improves with each book he writes) and have really appreciated how the characters have developed in depth and interest as Salvatore's writing has become better. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys the stories of Drizzt et al, but this series would be a good introduction to the world of the Forgotten Realms if you have never journeyed there before!"
5,"An exciting, action-packed saga of swords & sorcery","Origins Award-winning author R. A. Salvatore and the Wizards Of The Coast presents The Lone Drow, the second and latest chronicle in the on-going saga of the renegade dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden. Book II of The Hunter's Blades Trilogy, The Lone Drow is set amidst the icy wastelands of the Spine of the World, where a brutal war rages and threatens to tear down the remaining forces of civilization itself. An exciting, action-packed saga of swords, sorcery, internal struggle, and defying terrible odds in the battle to protect the virtues of life, hope, and love, The Lone Drow is action fantasy at its very best."
3,"Alright, not Great","This book was ok but by no means great compared to some of Salvatore's past work.It was great to see an angrier, more emotional side of Drizzt that we have not seen in a long time. On the flip side, the rest of the story is recycled and quite predictable as RAS has been for the last while.The Thousand Orcs showed some definite promise but The Lone Drow does quite a poor job of keeping my interest."
4,Reveiw on The Lone Drow,"As the second book in the series, The Lone Drow is between good and average. The good part is that it continues where the Thousand Orcs left off. The down side is that there isn't many gripping parts with the main character in them. This book should not be read by New Readers!"
2,Hmmm,"When this new trilogy first debuted I was quite excited and made sure to get a hot little copy of The Thousand Orcs into my hands the day it was released. I admit, it wasn't Salvatore's best but it was an entertaining read and interesting enough to motivate me to continue reading the series. The Lone Drow however is nothing more then a hack and slash book and a challenge to see how many readers can endure a 300-page description of a fight sequence. Rather then taking any time to truly do any justice to the characters he's created, Salvatore instead spends most of the time trying to mangle one long action sequence into an actual plot. This book is definently not worth the time."
1,370 pages of filler,"I've been a fan of Salvatore for years now. The Ice, wind and Dale Trilogy and The Dark Elf Trilogy (Which is my all time favorite work by Salvatore) are great. His new Forgotten Realm trilogy should be forgotten it's self. Especially the Lone Drow. There's is no plot at all. Just one Battle scene after another. Its grow tiresome and absurd very quickly. No matter how many enemies Drizzt or his buddies fight they wont die or get hurt. There is no character development at all. The dialog between characters so childish sounding. I know Salvatore never has had deep plot-lines for his books but this book takes the cake for being poor."
4,"Excellent, but not among his best work","I am a huge fan of R.A. Salvatore's work, in fact I own copies of almost everything he has written with my favorite being anything with Drizt as well as the cleric quintet. I agree with one reviewer about the love triangle with the elf and Cattie-brie how it doesn't seem to contribute to the story as a whole thus far. That is about my only real disappointment with the whole book. Other than that, it is an excellent read."
5,Great Book!,"I thought this was a great book. And this, like all Drizzt books was not a disappointment. The battle scenarios were great, as are the villians. If anything bad is to be said about it, I'd say it seemed a little rushed at the end. The jumping around from plotline to plotline got a bit annoying, because I think we see to little of the main character throughout the first half of the book. The ending was very noteworthy and original. Usually I can predict one way or another, what may happen in the end, but not this time. In my opinion, Salvatore proves to be the Lord of the Forgotten realms (again)."
1,"And again, and again, and again","Let's see... In every single book, Drizzt hasn't died, hasn't been injured, hasn't reaced a conclusion... I used to LIKE this author... And he USED to be good... but now he just uses almost the exact same storylines over and over again... don't buy this book, and you will save yourself a lot of money and boredome..."
1,The Lone Drow,I have not received it yet. I am very upset. I have been waiting too long. I received book three of this trilogy but I need to read this book two first.
5,"The Lone Drow : The hunter's Blades Trilogy, Book II:2",I have been reading books about the Drow for a long time. I have not yet read all but I am working on it. Mr Salvatore knows how to keep the reader asking for more. Love this book and all others I have read about Drizt.
5,Another installment in the Hunter's Blades Trilogy,"This book is far better than the first installment of the series. That said, it does have a few weaknesses. The main weakness is that the main character, Drizzit's action scenes are just too distracting to make them enjoyable. They just are too action packed to allow one person to focus on a main sequence. That is unfortunate, but it is not an overwhelming problem. The second problem is that it does focus too much at spots on the defense of the dwarven city. These are only small pieces of the overall work, so it does not distract from the quality of the story. It is well written and fits nicely with the first book. The thing I liked about this book was how it placed all these events in the larger context of what was occurring in area surrounding the spine of the world. Get it and enjoy!!!!!"
4,Good for Long-time Fans,"Although new readers might not enjoy this novel very much, die hard fans who have read about this unusual Drow from the beginning will no doubt enjoy this story. Salvatore's work in this series seems to be losing a bit of steam, but it is a fine read and a good product of the genre.The story is not too complicated, but there are highs and lows. Reading the other reviews will likely reveal too much about the story and take away from your enjoyment of the story. One of the reviews here on Amazon revealed a major event of the story that leaves the reader waiting for it to happen rather than being surprised."
5,Beautiful in person,Beautiful Box in person. Looks very sharp and fits all my husband's watches. He can't wait to buy more watches to fill it up.
1,Not happy with product,A piece of the lock mechanism broke the first time I used it- unable to lock or unlock . Keyhole plate scratched. Returned for refund.
3,Pretty but small,"It's a cute little necklace, with emphasis on little... Picture is at least twice as large as actual item, maybe 3 times as large. It looks kinda like something for a child, rather than an adult. It is pretty though"
4,Down South Bounce,"If you like down south music this is the one for you! I look for a c.d. with variaty and this one has it. Slow beats, fast beasts, clubbin songs, chill songs. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes master p or MJG and Eightball!"
4,Not written for lawyers - good reference for non-lawyers,"As the back cover makes clear, this is a handy desk reference for non-lawyers who work in or around the criminal law. Attorneys with similar interests might do better with Black's dictionary or Garner's Modern Legal Usage. These contain more examples, alternatives, suggestions on usage and etymology."
5,"Possibly the Best ""Rock Album"" Ever","I am mostly a classical-music fan, but there are a few examples of rock music that, I believe, poke through into the realm of high art -- one other example is Jefferson Airplane's early work. I have yet to hear any rock album other than ""The Final Cut"" that combines intelligent, meaningful lyrics with such a truly creative score. It was surprise for me recently to hear someone refer to this album as the WORST rock album he had ever heard. I started talking about it to others, and found that people more inclined towards classical music and jazz rate this album very highly, while true rock fans generally give it very low marks. This in itself makes the album unique.This album shows what rock music CAN do when it works well -- lasting commentary on political figures, war, technology, family, and genocide are all contained in this fine work."
5,A beautiful (albeit melancholy) album,"This is my favorite Pink Floyd album and it is unfortunate that it is so often overlooked. Yes, it is very different from their other works. Yes, it is a very dark/brooding/cynical album. However, at the same time it possesses the most powerful and eloquent lyrics of any album known to me. A poetic masterpiece. The music and production values are also excellent as they effectively accent the verbal images without overshadowing them. As mentioned below, if you want long complex musical jams (which I also like) look elsewhere. If you want to hear an involving, thoughtful album that stands on its own merit, give it a listen."
4,"Decent, but a little too depressing...","I am a die-hard Floyd fan. I will say that this is an excellent sounding and well written CD. But for anybody who is new to the world of Floyd, and seeks to find a good example of their music, this is not for you. The general musical sound of this CD is incosistant with mainstream Pink Floyd. If you are a fan, however, this is a must for any collection."
5,5 star finale for pink,Finalcut is one of floyds 3 best. it has rock yourpossiblepast notnowjohn fletchers the best is gunnersdream it gets to me southhamptondock is somber i like all these songs finalcut is agreat reflection on ww2 and postwar.
5,You never get jaded,"The first time you listen to this album, you're like ""what the hell!, is this even music!"". Especial singles such as ""The Fletcher memorial"", ""The prost-war dream"" and ""Not now John"" initially come across as just ""ear-shattering noise"".But ""The gunners dream"", ""The final cut"" and ""Two suns in the sunset"" are good for a starter to gain a feel of the album. Then you gradually start to enjoy ""Southampton Dock"", ""Paranoid eyes"" and ""Possible pasts"".Once you're really enjoying the later singles give the rest of them (such as ""Fletcher memorial"") a try. It's truly amazing, now you actually enjoy them!You know how you find a song that you really like and you listen to it so much that you get jaded of it. Well this album is different. Once you enjoy it, you never will get jaded. Every time sounds a bit different."
3,The Wall Extension,"This album is not bad; if you like the wall album, then you will like this album because it is an extension of the wall. This album doesn't even come close to there great albums such as darkside and wish you were here. The album is ok at best and don't expect any thing like there work form the 70s. Floyd is my favorite band and I have a lot of respect for there ever evolving music but I would like them to actually return to playing good rock music. If you are a Floyd fan, then go out and get but don't have high expectations. And if you are Roger Waters fan then I am sure you will enjoy."
2,Depends on what type of fan you are....,"If you listen to Pink Floyd for Roger Waters' cynical lyrical commentary, then this album is for you. It features some of his highest poetry showcasing the futility of war and frustrations of society's more disgruntled members. However if you are more interested in playing air guitar to Have a Cigar, than you likely find this album to be a complete drag. Musically, it's rather bland and pasted together with none of the intricate radiance heard best on Wish You Were Here, probably due to the details of Waters' expulsion Wright and intolerance of influence from Gilmour or Mason on this work. I also agree that this was the first Waters solo album in everything but name. This album is not, in my opinion, Pink Floyd but a side factor of the band's existance and thus not as good."
3,Not your average Floyd,"""The Final Cut"" is not for you if you are searching for ""quintessential"" Pink Floyd. This album finds Roger Waters in complete creative control of the band (at this point a trio due to Richard Wright's expulsion). David Gilmour's solos are few and frequently far between, and Waters' brooding lyrics are clearly the centerpiece of this melancholy work. Imagine the ""sedate"" parts of ""The Wall"" (i.e. ""Nobody Home"" and the beginning of ""One of My Turns"") and you have nearly the entire ""Final Cut"" (with the exception of ""Not Now John"".) The effect is that the music is a texture, rather than a discernible melody, and sometimes this is great (as in ""the final cut"") However, it sometimes makes the music sound fabricated and unoriginal (""Behind Paranoid Eyes""). Overall, I believe it to be a great collector's item, but not a ""must-have"" for fans of the pre- ""Wall"" Pink Floyd."
2,think twice,"Well I bought this album and listened for a couple of times, but that's all. It is only a one song album. Just try out other Pink Floyd albums and buy this one the last."
4,The Wall: Parte II,"Por si la Autocrucifixion practicada pro Waters en el disco anterior (the Wall) nu hubiera sido suficiente, en este disco tenemos mas de lo mismo: Historias de guerra, reclamos del individuo al sistema, sarcasmo y mucha critica al gobierno ingles (y de otros poaises), el sonido de disco es muy parecido al camino que se habia trasado con The Wall, recomendado para los incondicionales del grupo y para los que consideran The Wall el mejor disco de la banda"
4,"Not the better, not the worst..... also great.","I don't care if it's a Waters solo, or what happened with Wright or Mason, or whatever...... I only hear music, and is great......."
4,AN UNDERRATED FLOYDIAN CLASSIC,THIS WAS THE LAST FLOYD ALBUM WITH WATERS AND DESPITE RECIEVING NEGATIVE REVIEWS FROM CRITICS THIS SOLD MORE THAN MOST CHEESY 80'S NEW WAVE POP BANDS DID AND THOUGH IT WAS NOT THEIR BEST IT STIIL PACKED A LOT OF PUNCH AND IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO PINK FLOYD FANS.
2,All the parts of the Wall I didn't like,"This album sounds like a continuation of all the parts of the Wall I didn't like: bring the boys back home, vera lynn, etc., with the TV sounds effects and people shouting. OK for a movie score or multimedia masterpeice like the wall, but without the good songs in there to hold it together it just falls apart.This deserves its reputation as the worst post-Barrett Pink Floyd album."
1,Roger Waters' first solo release,"As a Roger Waters' album, I would give this two stars. As a Pink Floyd album, it gets a one star rating at best. It isn't really until the last three songs that it even feels vaguely like ""Pink Floyd"" (and that's ""The Wall"" era Floyd, at that), or that there's much musicality at all in Roger's poetic lament. There was a time that I enjoyed this album, when I appreciated everything Floyd in the '80's. But in retrospect, I think it's an outrage that this was released under the name ""Pink Floyd,"" and Gilmour and Mason need to be blamed as well for allowing Waters to take so much control. At least they remedied the situation with two fine Floyd releases sans Waters, and a great Gilmour solo release in 1984."
3,So so,"As a huge fan of Pink Floyd, I was expecting an awesome CD. I enjoy listening to the CD but some songs are just blah so skip past them. Im not sure if I had the chance that I would purchase it. But to each his own."
5,The best non-Barrett Pink Floyd Album,"The Final Cut is a sequel to The Wall and a Roger Waters dominated album. Picking up were The Wall left off, we follow the world after the second world war until it's demise to a thermonuclear holocaust. Waters chronicles the eventsthat lead up to the end of the world. It's also an animal of it's enviroment (The Reganomical world and a Thatcherized Europe). Many people hated this album because of it's depressing nature. I happen to enjoy it very much and will continue to do so in the future.The CD comes with a nice glossy booklet filled with lyrics and original artwork. Highly recommended."
1,The Final...,"When I first perchased a copy of this Cd, I thought it would be the best thing I've done in my entire life, it turned out to be the worst thing I've ever done. The songs are too boring and too long and the sound of the album sounds like a carton of clam chowder dropped on the deck of a pirate ship on a cloudy tuesday. After I listen to the entire Cd I crushed and threw it inot the garbage. I like Pink Floyd but this album [stinks], if you like bands like The Pansy Division or The Culture club and Richard Wrights solo album Wet Dream , you're going to love this CD but if you like Pink Floyd and any other good music, you'll want to destroy it. One plus, the solo in the Fletcher Memorial home brought me to tears and I cried for hours because it was so beautiful. The Final Cut is not the cutting but final is it?"
3,Boring,I bought this about eight years ago when I saw it going cheap. I've listened to it once since (the very day I bought it). Nough said. Why would anyone listen to this when they can choose from the entirety of the PF catalogue?
3,The Panel,"This is a sound of Waters' watered down Wall, band reluctantly in tow. Although it was probably hissed upon release, and still undoubtedly relegated to their ""lesser albums"" category, compared to everything after, TFC feels like the last scraps of any authentic power the band ever squeezed out. For their own sake, Floyd should have stayed true to the title."
3,Leftovers from The Wall re-made into an anti-war concept album,"Pink Floyd's 1983 concept album The Final Cut finds the band without keyboardist Richard Wright and with the sole artistic direction of Roger Waters, who acts as the sole writer, co-producer and singer for 88% of the record. The album is made up of a large amount of leftover songs from The Wall's sessions, which were then re-worked lyrically to fit the album's concept of a critique towards British military action upon the 1982 Falklands War, Margaret Thatcher's initiative towards it, and (to quote Waters) the unreal notion of an ever-peaceful ""post-war dream"", present since World War II (in which Waters' father lost his life). It received mixed reviews upon its release and David Gilmour has often expressed severe dislike towards the record. It would also be Roger Waters' final studio album with Pink Floyd."
4,Roger Waters takes charge.,A highly underrated album that has been basically forgotten. The brain behind The Floyd takes full charge in an album dealing with the sadness and aftermath of war. Most of these songs are not marketable and that's why the album is not popular; Roger Waters created an album of his own vision rather than something the company or the public wanted. Listen to it intellectually rather then for pleasure. It will be quite an experience.
2,Pink Floyd's death and Pink Fraud's birth,"First of all folks, this isn't Pink Floyd. This is a Roger Waters album with some small contributions from David Gilmour and Nick Mason. Waters kicked Wright right out of the band for substance abuse. Anyway, this album sounds like a bunch of cold leftovers from the Wall with more elaborate orchestration. The Final Cut is more classically oriented than the wall but there are no killer guitar tracks, though ""Not now John"" or whatever it's called is decent. Face it, this is sterilized Pink Floyd and kind of stale as well."
3,Roger Watters's first solo album,This is not a Pink Floyd album. David Gilmour sings on only one track. Keyboardist Richard Wright is gone altogether. And the now-overbearing Roger Watters completely dominates the proceedings. This doesn't mean there aren't some good songs here. But much of the topical concerns of the early 1980s (especially the Falkland Islands war stuff) sound dated and trite today. Too bad this serves as the last Watters collaberation with the rest of the Pink Floyd. They work much better together than seperately.
4,One of the Most Under-rated Pink FLoyd Albums!!!!,"The Final Cut, IS Pink Floyd. Roger Waters final album with Floyd, delivers masterful lyrics while David Gilmour plays some of the smoothest rythmic guitar parts of all the Floyd Albums. The title track, The Final Cut, gives me chills every time I hear it. ""One Of The Few"" is eerie poeticism. If you have The Wall, you have to have The Final Cut."
5,A great album,"The Final Cut is one of their best albums. If you listen to Your Possible Pasts it sounds like they are talking about themselves (Do you remember me how we used to be, do you think we should be closer). Waters wrote this album, his last with the band, entirely by himself and dedicated it to his dad who died in World War 2."
3,"Buy it NOW only for ""Not now John""-20 yrs after release...","""not now john"" is the only song that ever gets much play on my cd player 9 years after buying it. The rest of the album is a slightly depressing follow-up to ""The Wall"" it seems. It's okay, but a little bit of a grasping attempt at being pretentious by Roger Waters. Great for fans of Pink Floyd or Roger Waters or classic rock, though really NOT for fans of progressive or art rock genres."
3,The Final Cut,"Well, this is not a Pink Floyd album. One song (Not Now John) stands out among the rest which for the most part sound the same. No offence to Waters, but it seems he got a little lazy in writing this album, not putting any attention into the music as he did in Animals and The Wall. Although lyrically brilliant, musically poor and not worth buying. I want you to note this is a die hard Floyd fan. Looking for good Floyd, try Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall."
1,Utterly disappointed.,"I remember that when I bought this album, I thought:""Well, maybe it's not as bad as everyone says.""How wrong I was.I also bought it because I'm a Pink Floyd fanatic and I manage to find the best in everything they do.Oh, but not this.This album is not worthy of the name Pink Floyd. It isn't even worthy of being mentioned in the Pink Floyd discography.I managed to get over Roger's so called ""magnum opus"" The Wall.Hell, I even managed to like it.But this, not this.I don't understand how could anyone manage to get over crap like The Final Cut, ecpecially Pink Floyd fans, who should really know better!David Gilmour: ""I said to Roger, if these songs weren't good enough for The Wall, why are they good enough now? We had the most awful time of my life. Roger had got Rick out, Nick wasn't around much and now he was starting on me.A most unpleasant and humiliating experience.""I rest my case."
1,Taking the band down with him...,"Upon listening to some of these samples, I realize now how embarassingly introverted and unrewarding this album always was. While The Wall ultimately succeeded in projecting the narcissism of the jaded rock and roller into a phantasmagoria of paranoid self-delusion, here the listener is forced to identify with Roger Waters' intimate and outlandish self pity and absurd free association of ideas (Jesus was crucified, and guilty me, I watched too much TV...) whispered in carefully phrased pseudo-ironic fashion over dull funereal orchestral moanings... While the title cut recalls Comfortably Numb musically, its dramatic recollection (invention?) of a near-suicide by Waters comes accross less as an inspired moment than as a cynical attempt to force the listener once and for all to identify wholly the classic Pink Floyd sound with his navel-gazing or else..."
1,"MUSICALLY, IT'S HORRIBLE","Granted Roger has some great ideas and fantastic lyrics througout Floyd's career, but I can do without this depressing, grating, sonic misadventure. I totally enjoy most that is Floyd, but this one is the worst. As uneven as ""Momentary Lapse of Reason"" is, at least there are musical parts on that one which is pleasing to listen to. Not so on ""The Final Cut"". I have friends who love this album, but it is beyond me as to why. If you liked ""Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking"" then by all means, indulge in ""Cut"". I'll stick with the true Floyd albums. Funky Dung this ain't."
1,Anyone else miss Syd?,"I miss the Floyd as they used to be;an introspective, experimental, phycadelic group who were not afraid to venture slightly beyond the realms of normal human understanding and experience. I just can't feel that much sympathy for Waters here, and the lyrics, while beautiful and poetic at times, do not convey subtle or layered messages, as his lyrics used to. Personally, I'd much rather listen to ""Take up Thy Stethascope and Walk"", which is an insanely dark song compared to this material. It seems like pretty much the only tradgity Waters has to go on is the death of his father when he was three months old. While that is certainly tragic, hey, my friend lost her dad when she was 11, which I think would be alot harder. Finally, I have a guestion to ask. After hearing this album for the first time, did anyone here say to themeselves ""God Syd, I wish you were here"".?"
2,THE FINAL CUT FOR ORIGINAL PINK FLOYD,"I think that the final cut is too overrated. It is not that great. It has 3 alright songs: The Fletcher Memorial Home, Southampton Dock and The Final Cut. The Fletcher Memorial Home appeared on Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, it was the only song that came of the final cut. In other words the final cut is not reccomended, I bought it because I collect all Pink Floyd CDs.It is attrochious."
1,"Run, Run, Run, Run","You better Run Like Hell from this album because its the worst thing ever produced on tape besides Metallica's St Anger. I can't believe the record company allowed this piece of crap to come out. The songs lack melody and the music is a great way to cure insomnia.To the people who gave this album two stars or more (esp. the four and five star ones), whats wrong with you? You guys are Pink Floyd Sheep. I can't believe you don't know what is terrible music... you guys are no better than a Staind fan!"
1,"Come on Roger, hang it up already!!",Quit depressing everyone with your boring music man! Just put a lid on it and walk away from the mic forever!
2,Weakest Floyd Album,"While there are a few scattered good songs on this album, it has too little involvement by other members of the band. While I agree that Roger Waters was clearly the stronger lyricist (vs Gilmour), the band performs the best when all members are involved in the writing. In addition, I think the musical quality is better when Gilmour writes solo as opposed to Waters. Waters never got over the death of his father in WWII, and this album simply describes his feelings and the war itself. He puts emotion into it, but the writing quality itself is weak. He focuses too much on himself and not the band."
2,Miserable for the sake of being miserable,"I don't need music to be happy and peppy and light to enjoy it but after such a wonderful run at meshing high-brow and low-brow over the years, the Pink Floyd ship ran aground on the shoals of dull, joyless, blubbering melancholy with this one. Thanks, Roger! It seems that Waters took the success of The Wall as the green-light to cull away the musicality and scope of that album and focus strictly on depressed self-examination but there's not much to love about this work apart from Gilmour's guitar.This Pink Floyd album also has the distinction of being the only Floyd album in their discography that I literally tossed out as I felt no need to revisit it in the future."
3,"The Wall 2, Well Sort Of . . .","Listening to this recording you can clearly hear that it is the beginning of the end for Pink Floyd as we know. First, Wright's keyboard virtuosity is missing (he had left the band by this time)and Gilmour's presence is like a ghost scared to show itself. Despite these absences, Waters is truly amazing in his intensity of feeling making The Final Cut worthwhile to own and have in your CD collection. As far as concept albums go, it is one of the best--it continues the anti-war ravings and isolation themes evident in The Wall. Also, it anticipates the primary theme in Water's solo album Amused to Death. The gems of this release are: The Post War Dream, When The Tigers Broke Free, The Final Cut, Not Now John, and the incredible closing song Two Suns In The Sunset. While The Final Cut is not nearly as remarkable as The Wall, it is a great link from that masterpiece to Waters' solo career beginning with The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking."
2,the end,"The Final Cut suffers a bit from not enough musical ideas, and trying to make the lyrics the MAIN appeal of the album over everything else. Clearly this was an approach not everyone can appreciate, including me. The lyrics are nice, and some of the vocal melodies are good enough, but this album is definitely lacking compared to EVERY other Pink Floyd album created before this one."
2,The Final Cut...Cut if off your list of must-have Floyd CDs.,"It simply is not very good. Sure, Roger Waters has a way of communicating every detail of his apparently very traumatic childhood, but it makes the CD way too dramatic, very overboard. What's even more disappointing is that the music isn't all that great either.Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE Floyd fan, since I was about 9 years old (now in my 30s). But this CD simply does not live up to prior Floyd greats such as Dark Side, Meddle, Animals, Wish..., Atom Heart Mother. It is, however, a perfect compliment to The Wall (which I really liked at first, but now NEVER listen to--probably because it was too commercially successful, played too much).In any event, I gave this 2 stars because the last few songs are decent: Two Suns, Fletcher Memorial, are probably the best in the bunch. Sadly, though, not worth plunking down your hard earned cash. There is better Floyd to be had."
4,"""I AM THE BOSS"", says Roger","Pink Floyd is my favorite rock band of all time, so I DO love this album. When I was in college, I would play this album and take a few drinks every time I felt depressed (which was a LOT). Don't worry, I'm better now.The album may say Pink Floyd on it, but it is clearly Roger Waters' music. One can't help but feel sorry for the other three members of the band, as it seems they were practically forced to go along with everything Roger wanted. Even when we hear David Gilmour singing ""Not Now John"" (great song, by the way), you can almost hear him saying ""This is not what I wanted to do"" in the background. Like the Beatles, it seems this was their ""Let It Be"" album before the four of them split for good.Now that their LIVE 8 set is history, I hope they will continue the momentum and stay together for a tour."
2,Weak departure for Waters.,"This was one of the first Pink Floyd albums I purchased, and it remais today one of my least favorites. It lacks the experimentation of the early albums and the orchestrations 70's albums. Many consider it an extension of the Wall, but I think of it as a series of lesser outtakes from the recording of that landmark album. Where the Wall was cohesive and flowed along relatively well, this album has a neurotic, depressvie vibe to it that makes it hard to penetrate. I know many Floyd fans out there will cringe, but I prefer A Momentary Lapse or Reason and the Division Bell to the Final Cut. Mind you, those post-Waters albums are not great either, by any means (not compared to their 70's classics), but at least I can sit through them. Water's relentless rants make it difficult to listen to the whole of The Final Cut, with the exception of ""Keeps your fithy hands...."" and ""Two suns...""."
2,"Good Lyrics, Bad Everything Else","This is Floyd's worst album. Waters' lyrics are great but the music (instrumentation) is lacking. Anyone who thinks this is their best dont like music, they only like lyrics. Pass on this and just read a book. By the way Rogerless Floyd is better than this, and its a good thing too because if they would have ended when this came out the would have went out with a stinker. Any and every other Floyd album is much much better musically, this is lyrical masterpiece but a musical joke."
4,Completely underappreciated...,"First of all, I wouldn't go as far as to say that the added track is ""unecessary"" as it was originally supposed to be on this album anyways, and the subject of the song fits quite well with the theme of the album. Personally, whenever I heard the end of the song, in my mind I expected ""The Hero's Return"" to begin.I gave the new remaster 4 stars of 5, because they REALLY should have included ""The Hero's Return Part 2"" ... Those of you who have heard that bit would probably agree with me on that.Positives though, I have never heard this album sounds as crystal clear... the entire album doesn't sound even HALF as muddy as it used to. I didn't know HOW they could've made it better until I actually HEARD it. There were background vocals and sound effects I only BARELY heard before. Roger's whispering on parts sounded more like singing. It's just a beautiful remaster altogether and gave me a new appreciation for this project."
5,Great lyrics and melodies that make you cry,"This album was Roger Waters last with Pink Floyd, but one could argue that it was Roger Waters first solo album. Continuing his thoughts about war and its toll on mankind, this albulm touches the soul with lyrics so genuine and melodies so moving that it brings me to tears everytime I listen to it. Its not an CD to play at a festive party, but it is simply one of the best CD's recorded. If you are a music fan that appreciates good lyrics and moving melodies, buy this CD and put on your headphones and sit back. Most underrated CD from Pink Floyd."
3,Sentimental garbage?,"At the first listening time I wondered how low the Floyds can go on their last real Pink Floyd record. It felt all too sentimental. But on the second listening time I realised it was all carefully considered. This record is a fine continuation for The Wall. Don't be confused by the little sentimental melody, listen to the words, depressing but so ingenious."
3,sub-par last floyd album (original line-up),"in my view this album is not in a class with animals, wish you were here, the wall or dark side. musically and lyrically it is like the more tedious parts of the wall without the standout ones. more of a waters solo album than a true floyd piece."
1,Waters got absolutely mad.,"This rest-Wall album showed, what a guy Waters is: he's megalomanic, egoistic, musically absolutely poor at this time. Awful!"
2,I love floyd but...,"The music is to me, to far and few between. It's like listening to poetry with a little bit of background music. I can get in to it if I try but it's a real effort, almost laborious. Nothing about this cd draws me in like every other Floyd album out there. The lyrics are great but personally I need the floyd magic in the music as well. There just simply is no musical adventure to me. Dry and too plain for such magnificent musicians. I know many will dissagree but that's ok. This is my viewpoint as I know others view this as a masterpiece. I give it 2 stars although I actually will not listen to this cd anymore."
5,crispy mozzarella,"I've just watched Roger Waters' In the Flesh DVD and it started me on this nostalgia trip. So I made some fried mozzarella. If you've never had this, try it -it's bad but soooo good!That got me on to The Final Cut -suffice to say it raises the hackles and brings tears to the eyes like no album ever. Buy it and tell your friends. It should be on the school curriculum."
5,Riveting,"Roger Waters wraps up his stint with Pink Floyd. I would never call Pink Floyd my favorite band, yet I may concede that the Waters-lead era (Animals-Final Cut) is the greatest music ever performed. That's purely a personal opinion, so take that as you might. I'm digressing so let me get to this album.The first time I heard it I was amazed. It's terribly rare that an album would grab me like that on the first listen. Dark, depressing, moving - if this is your definition of musical entertainment, you will love this album. It sounds a bit like an extension of The Wall only more depressing and without interludes or much dialogue. More focused on the hopelessness of war than the helplessness of alienation. It's got a timeless sound. It will have you reflecting and pondering as you listen. It will grab you with it's melodies and lyrics and leave you wanting more. If you care for the darker moods in song, you should definitely give this a listen."
2,"Excellent lyrics, boring voice","The last ""real"" pink floyd album, but i think that you get very tired if you want repeated listening."
1,Something Stinks,"I thought when they said ""the final cut"" that this would be their last, alas, unfortunately it wasn't.Floyd was a bad band in their day, but this CD tops it all off in terms of awful.Please people, I'm begging you, do not even take a chance on this one.Verrry Bad, verrry, verrry bad!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Final Cut by Pink Floyd,"This disc arrived and looked like it had been SAND BLASTED. It would not play, ever disc player I tried gave the same code ""BAD DISC"" - You cannot tell me the company wasn't away of this!"
5,GO BUY THIS,"The Stray Cats are one of those band that sound great live and in the studio- this album demonstrates the engergy the band puts out and has some great tunes that are hard to find like "" Stray Cat Blues"" and "" Gina""."
1,Wrong region,"The cd goes in my DVD player and says wrong region,do I have the right money to send it back?"
2,don't bother,"This movie fails both as a comedy and as a horror movie. Wes Craven and Eddie Murphy team up for a story of a Caribbean vampire who comes to New York to search for his 'queen.' It had the potential to be a good movie, either as a horror movie or as a parody of vampire movies. The problem is they tried to do both, a comedy and a horror story, and neither carried off very well. Murphy does do an excellent job as Maximillian (the lead role), and it might be one of his better performances. The other characters he played (a preacher and an Italian thug) were substandard. While Murphy's performance was great, the rest of the cast was wooden. Kadeem Hardison and John Witherspoon are the comic relief in the film. They are over the top and the movie just isn't horrific enough to need comic relief. It's not a movie I would bother with, unless you can catch it on Encore."
2,vampire in brooklyn,it was delivered in timely order but does not play in all dvd players im gonna have to return and attemp to get a refund
5,Vampire in Brooklyn is a good and funny vampire movie.,"""Vampire in Brooklyn"" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen(and one of the funniest). With Wes Craven directing the movie, it has its moments of scares, but with Eddie Murphy in the movie as well, it is a funny movie too. So if you're in the mood for a scary vampire movie with alot of laughs, then check out ""Vampire in Brooklyn""."
2,sometimes funny but not that good,"Eddie Murphy(The Golden Child, Daddy Day Care) is the vampire in this movie and he comes to Brooklyn and falls for Angela Bassett(Strange Days, Supernova)..so he then stalks her and then stalks her and kills people she knows...Allen Payne(Jason's Lyric, The Perfect Storm) plays Bassett's partner and trys to stop Eddie..Kadeem Harrison(The 6th Man) is the bug eating follower of Eddie. John Witherspoon(Friday, Next Friday, Friday After Next) also stars.....not much of a story here though Eddie plays a lot of characters like in The Nutty Professor movies."
1,"Horrifyingly, frighteningly BAD movie","I am almost ashamed to admit this but my husband and I saw this movie right after he proposed to me and we have joked that it is a good thing he proposed BEFORE the movie because I may have not given the same answer after being made to watch this movie (truth to be told though it wasn't my BHs fault, his roomate chose this flick - and we've never let him forget it)! This was probably one of the WORST movies I have ever seen! The plot and acting were just awful and the movie was not very funny."
4,Heavily criticized but I think it works,"This movie works because it is completely different than any other vampire movie I've seen. It has an intriguing story line, some good special effects and a very rare mix of horror and humor. Critics claim that it is not scary enough to work as a horror movie, and while not as scary as many it has it's moments. The comedy in the movie makes me laugh. Julius, the ghoul, is definitely a bright spot. Murphy has some good lines as well of the darker variety such as when referring to the quickest way to a girls heart he replies ""Through the rib cage, but it is a bit messy."" Definitely recommend this movie if your a fan of Eddie Murphy or vampire movies."
2,LOW POINT in the careers of ALL involved!,"Now, I will admit. I did go see it when it first came out, but this movie is a pure joke. Not a horror film and not a comedy either. Murphy looked ridiculous w/all that stuff on. Angela, Kadeem (who's acting is mediocre already), and Allen...you guys could do so much better.I don't think I can say much more."
1,Did not work,I made sure that everyone knew that this DVD was being shipped to the proper region so that it should play ok. But it would not work. Tried it in 10 different DVD players with the same result. Will not buy DVD from this seller again.
1,USA NO ORDER _ PAL TYPE ONLY,"Not gonna even try to RMA it....too much trouble for the low cost. But beware of this item from this shipper....unless you live in Brazil, North Korea, Japan, etc....will not work on you machine. It's a standard the US does not use called PAL. Dang....and I wanted this movie!"
5,Just what I was looking for thank you so much. It got here quick and in great shape,Just what I was looking for thank you so much. It got here quick and in great shape
1,Vampire in Brooklyn,It was so sad that I couldn't play and see the DVD video here in Japan due to its area protection security...
1,wrong area cannot watch it on our dvd,"When we ordered this dvd we did not know what a region was, now we get to just look at the dvd sitting around taking up space, I requested that it be changed out for a region 1 which is the united states. We did not get any responce from the seller at all."
3,"pretty good, but...","...I hate Eddie Murphy. I'm a huge Wes Craven fan. I think the story and comedy in this movie is great. Personally, I believe this is one of Wes Craven's top 3 movies he's ever done. Nightmare and Serpent / Rainbow being the other two. Worth watching at least once, more if you're an Eddie Murphy fan."
1,"Slow, Slow, Slow","Read the fine print before ordering so you won't be disappointed like we were. According to the Olympus web site this card reader has about 1/4 the read speed (3.5Mbps) of their cameras (12Mbps). Not only is it slow, but it hangs when trying to transfer a large number of pictures from say a 1G memory card.It's not worth returning though. I'll keep it but it's way to slow to use as a thumb-drive so it's only going to get used to transfer an occasional picture or two."
1,"Slow, Slow, Slow and guess... Slow!","Don't buy it!Save your money. When I bought it I was so excited about my new camera that I decided to buy some accessories for it but this one turn out to be a waste of money. It's very slow, just if you have a couple of pictures in your XD then it will be just Ok.I have to say that I have a great computer (Macbook Pro) and that I'm not the only one having this problems. Just check the comments.Bye"
2,Olympus 292049 USB200 Media reader:disappointing,The small size and ease of use are great but the performance of this card reader is disappointingly and frustratingly slow. I gave up and went back to downloading photos directly from the camera.
1,Disappointed...,On my laptop it took over an hour to transfer between 10-15 photos. Read the fine print in the leaflet that comes with the reader and it states that it won't necessarily work with all computer systems. Mine is a pretty common Dell laptop with brand name components. When I transfered the same photos from the laptop to an external hard drive it took about 30 seconds...
4,Light duty,"Product was packed well and shipped promptly. Good seller.As for the product itself, be warned it is a bit on the light duty side.I think a crow bar could get into it quite easily. I think by adding 2 more locks, one to each side and welding in some reinforcement bars along the lid it will be sufficiently secure for most applications. Its basically the same guage sheet metal they make standard toolboxes out of. It does have all welded seams. Lid pivots on two bolts with lock nuts on the inside (so attempts to loosen from outside will probably just spin the nut along with the bolt unless they really pry the two apart enough to lock the nut..may weld that too."
5,I wish i never read this book,"to anyone who knows any physics, computer science, or just plain logic, this book is a step-by-step guide in the building of frankenstein's monster. I made a neural-network -- computer brain that learns -- in college (though mine didn't work very well) so i'm familiar with the concpets in this book and know that it is practical to make such things as computer programs, if not actually building them as machines. Although to create such a thing you need a lot of math, and this book has no math, this book is very convining and explains how to create a machine that thinks, learns, and generally behaves just like a living animal or even human, even has unpredictable free will and dreams. If you don't want to see every living thing on Earth as just-a-machine, or if you want to maintain some faith in the human soul, don't read this book. Because this book is very, very convincing."
1,Good starting point for budding pop-culture AI philosopers.,"Braitenburg's book, Vehicles, is both a success and failure. As a philosophy paper, it is full of ideas for AI systems, simple that they may be, to emulate some interesting ""behaviors"". Unfortunately, Braitenburg's ideas and style of writing would personify very simple electromechanical relationships such as: Shine a light on a sensor, and the vehicle backs away. This could be called ""timid"". From any hard science or engineering standpoint, the book is stilted and somewhat incomplete."
3,Best CD by her so far!,"I never liked her previous CDs. Definetly she is not world class opera singer except that she is from England(lots of local fans for patriotic reason). However, she is reasonalble good broadway show tune singer. This Cd will prove it. Only minus for this CD is that she shouldnot have recorded operatic pieces since she is not talanted opera singer at all."
2,Decoration coming off..,"This is a nice scooter, but the decal on the body of it is already coming off after just one use by our daughter. She rode it for less than 30 mins, and there is noticeable wear. Large pieces of the black sand papery material have just peeled away, making it look old and worn out after just one use."
3,Neat idea,"My son really liked it at first, but lost interest quickly as he doen't use it much anymore."
2,Stinks,"Hard to ride, not enough cushion on wheels (plastic), and heavy - so it is harder to push. Get a razor."
4,Cool upgrade to my son's razor,This four wheel scooter is a lot of fun to use. Large deck and four huge wheels make for a stable ride. The deck swiwels allowing for super tight turns. Still a little big for my 6 yr old but he is really getting the hang of it.feels a lot more solid than the rinky dink 2 wheel scooters!
5,A Nifty Little Scooter,"I bought this scooter for one of my grandsons, who previously had a different brand. It was a huge hit. What he really liked was the smoother, easier, sharper turning this one provided. I'm told that this scooter is popular with kids of all ages but I can assure you that it works very well for younger kids. My grandson is barely seven. Of course, if a kid uses one of these scooters he or she needs to take the standard safety precautions, which include wearing a helmet and avoiding areas where cars are coming and going. Used properly this scooter provides a lot of fun, a few thrills, much excitement and plenty of exercise. It is well constructed and looks good, meaning it will please both the buyer and the user. Now if only the manufacturer could keep up with demand by making more of them and not just during holiday periods."
4,Great scooter except for the wheels,"My [...] daughter got this for Christmas and loves it. She had been wanting a Razor, but we thought it was just too dangerous. This one seems much sturdier and safer--but it's still cool. Cool enough that my daughter's best friend (who has a Razor) declared, ""I love this scooter so much I want to marry it!"" The wheels are the only thing I don't like. They're just smooth plastic, like Big Wheel tires or something. The rest of the scooter is sturdy and well-built, so I can't understand the cheapo wheels. If they become a problem, I will take the other reviewer's advice and purchase better wheels at a skateboard shop."
5,"""The nextsport""","Very pleased with the Asphalt scooter from NextsportAs a matter of fact the product should be considered as the ""The Next action sport""Fun, cool, innovative"
4,Fuzion scooter,"I ordered one for my 7 year old son and ended up buying another one for my 9 year old as well (who I thought was already out of the ""scooter"" phase)! They love it! It's a great combination of skateboard/scooter with a lot of speed and really gives them great exercise but is sturdy enough that even I rode it!"
5,Fast Shipping - Great Product,The product was delivered quickly and in great shape. My daughter received it for Christmas and LOVES it. She can't wait for the snow to dissapear so she can take it outside.
5,Not just for kids!!!,"I'm 32, 6'4"" and I love this thing!! If you like board sports you will have a blast on this thing, heck no matter what you like you will have a blast on the Fuzion. I'm a bit tall for it, but when you bend your knees, sit your weight back, and start gliding into turns it feels so smooth and is so much fun to ride.It carves really nice, especially on a slight decline. Steeper roads can be pretty scary going downhill, because it picks up speed quickly and handling can be difficult at high speeds.I love riding it, and highly recommend it."
4,jogger stroller,"We really like this stroller for our children. It pushes easily and gives the kids a smooth ride. We just wish it would fold up to a smaller size for storage, not sure how that could happen, but it'd be nice."
4,Easy to handle,"I love this jogger. My son loves to go with me. However the shade on it is a little awkward in the sense that its not really adjustable. You can either place it up or down. And sometimes I need it in the middle. I did find a way to do this but I feel with the amount of money I spent, I really shouldn't have to. It was very easy to put together. It's heavy to lift so I can't take it with me anywhere unless my husband goes with me. And because of the size, storage is awkward. Be warned that the wheels are not inflated when you get them, I used my olders sons bicycle pump and it worked great."
5,great condition!,"love this cd! Company was great, came is perfect condition and quickly. :)I would recommend anyone to purchase from them. And maria mena is awesome :)"
3,I tried something new and I'm not disappointed...,"Maria Mena's cd was a little off the path of the music that I normally purchase. However, I kept hearing the song ""A Few Small Bruises"" on Yahoo Radio, and since I really identified with it, I went ahead and bought the cd.I'm pretty pleased. It's definitely a good listen, and her voice is really original.Stand-outs are ""A Few Small Bruises"", ""Fragile"", and ""What's Another Day"""
3,why is Maria Mena touring with Hanson?,"As odd as the title of my review may seem, I don't think Maria Mena's music is simular to that of Hanson... I believe Maria's music and lyrics to be simular to the songwriting ability of Michelle Branch. A lot of the songs on White Turns Blue sound simular...which I find disappointing. Maria is from Norway, and I was really hoping this album would include some Norway-inspired pop songs... Just as Ace of Base did Sweedish pop in the '90s, and TATU's version of their album had elements of Russian influence. I find Maria's singing voice as a mix of Michelle Branch and Aselin Debison's vocals.The best song on this cd is Lose Controle. It sounds like the type of song you'd hear at a semi-formal dinner party. But if you're in the mood for pop, there's more than enough pop music on this album!"
5,WOW,"Well all I have to say is Maria Mena is my new favorite singer. While her lyrics are amazing as are her melodies, her voice is just so original. My favorite song is by far ""Your Glasses,"" however, other outstanding tracks include Blame it on Me, What's Another Day, Sorry, and You're the Only one. If you like White turns Blue I must recomend her 1st album Another Phase. While you might not be able to find it in the states, you should really check out the songs ""Ugly"" and ""Sleep to Dream."""
2,Die Hard fans only,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge DJ Bobo fan. But this CD was kind of a dissappointment. The first CD is almost completely identical to his ""Dance With Me"" CD. The second CD is pretty good, with good live songs, but overall not too impresive. I say, only buy if you are a die hard fan."
5,awesome item... but beware huge costs on s & h!!!,"check out my review I did for the 14"" diameter one!"
4,Don't use it as your ONLY book,I was expecting something a little more in depth. The Uromastyx section should really not be trusted. I reccomend joining a mailing list for your particular species.
4,Its all good,The book was fine. I have not bought a book yet that gives all the details I need but this book was finel.
1,Great at first but then it just dies,"Great Album, Great Music, Exciting - but I loaned Alex Some Money Years ago and he jumped the Country and the Brother Aint Paid me - now he's dun a bunk !If you know where he is - please let me know ......."

4,jazZy &hip hOp..whatta combination,"this was a good choice...since it also benefits AIDS. so its like a double bonus!..Some of my favorite artists are on this tribute to the Duke!..Roots, Amel, Kweli & Mos..its a good cd, it's real chill. Sophisticated Lady w/Amel is nicely done. Her voice just pushes it over the edge! her voice, very beutiful.This cd if full of jazz talents & great vocals. sweep this up!"
3,fun toy but very poor durability,"It is a really fun toy for a boy to play with. However, even though the gun appears to be very sturdy, the handle came loose after just a few days. There is no point to return it since you will pay in shipping costs almost as much as you paid for it initially. So I consider it a waste. Buy something more expensive and more durable instead."
3,No caps,My boys loved these except one (we had bought two) broke within a few days. We were also expecting to receive the caps (as shown in the picture). That was a bit of a let down.
1,"Broke after 8 shots, Made in China...","I am sorry to say, but this little cap gun which my son (and I) were excited to receive broke after 8 shots. Like the other review, the hammer spring stopped working, and made the gun unable to fire. Made in China - big surprise..."
3,Not Quite Like the Old West,"I purchased this DIE CAST CAP GUN gun to use as a prop in a theatre performance to replace another cap gun that broke after a week's use. The barrel of this gun is more heavier and slightly larger than the run of the mill cap gun. Also, the gun has a more powerful blast when it goes off than the other cap gun we used. The negative things about the gun are that the handle is plastic (and it's not an extremely durable plastic) and that after a few night's of use, this gun started skipping caps when fired. If you're looking for a cap gun for an elementary student to play with, this gun isn't too bad. However, if you're looking for a reliable cap gun, you'll want to find a different cap gun."
5,Incredible Debut,"I first heard this album in high school 1978 and I was blown away. I was stunned in my tracks. I never heard a voice so angelic. The closest so far has been Chante Moore. Incredible unique voice and timbre. A lot of soul and emotion in her music. She also writes half of the songs on the album. Angela is one of greatest vocalists ever. A rare talent. I have the vinyl and CD version of this album, its too bad that the CD process takes some of the naturalness out of vocals, the vinyl sounds much better"
4,Useful,"Werebeasts seem to be one of the most common creatures in Ravenloft, no matter who the DM is. Oh well. This will give a bit of a different edge to werebeasts in Ravenloft. Much more useful and dynamic than Van Richten's Guide to the Lich."
4,Excellent Reference,"This book is a must have to a DBA. It contains all the little gotchas in managing SQL Server. All the items that we come across while searching for something that I think""Man I gotta remember that"". 99% of them are in this book, so I don't have to print them out and maintain a seperate library.Not a book to buy if you are looking something to read to learn SQL Server. This is a reference for someone who already is using it extensivly.Ross"
2,No mea culpa here.,"The book is well written. The story is familar in terms of mobster literature. Its a pretty good read. She leaves me cold. She divorced said mob and turned her life around when she had no other choices. Maybe that was the best she could do given the particulars of her life, but something is too off putting for me to be able to sympathise.And turned her life around to what? We arn't give any particulars of her new ""independent"" life. For safety's sake? Who knows"" Ultimatly, who cares?"
3,Poor Editing,"I found this biography fascinating (in the vein of ""The Glass Castle""), but there were too many typos - at least in the edition I read. These mistakes (often 1 or more to a page) were disconcerting and inexcusable, in my opinion, since the book was co-written. You'd figure one of the two writers would have found the other's errors. I have to give Andrea credit, though, given her childhood, she's truly a survivor. Her story makes me wonder what might have been had she experienced an ordinary or a privileged upbringing."
1,No Accountability,"I'm still waiting for the other part of the title to materialize. That is, when did she become an independent woman? She leeched from man to man and then to the Witness Protection Program. She even needed a man to help her write the book.She might talk the talk but she did not walk the walk. Even when her world is falling apart (again), she first thinks of who is going to care for her first before she thinks of putting food on the table for her kids. Me, me, me, me, me.One got the feeling she was only sorry she got caught. If she had never been caught, she'd still be mooching off the organized crime system.If she had to do it all over again, you know she'd do it again in a heartbeat."
5,Dan Reed Network.....REMASTERED!!,"Amazon Sellers are asking around $20 dollars and up for new unremastered copies of this CD put out by Polygram Records. It costs over $9.00 for the un-remastered MP3 download. Why purchase those versions when you can get a remastered version of this CD for around $9.00. This remastered version by Lemon Records sounds great and includes 2 bonus cuts, Get To You (Dub Mix) and Get To You (12"" version). Also, the booklet has updated information about the band."
3,"It grabs you, then lets you go...","The Session, by Judith Kelman, is a story with a promise. A young therapist, working with the criminally insane, witnesses a brutal murder in prison, and is fired for not controlling the situation. She develops a private practice, but is obsessed with getting to the bottom of this murder.Mixed in this pot is her relationship with a deaf twin sister (a best-selling author), an insane brother, a loving ex, the family of the murdered woman, and some strange patients.By page 300, I still don't know what is going to happen. By the end (page 359), I'm disappointed. The ending is bizarre (the ""bad guy"" ends up being the one all the clues point to), there are subplots still up in the air, and the story feels incomplete, as in the ""You need to cut the text down 50 or so pages"" directive.This was a novel with promise, but the promise fizzled out at the end."
5,Great Book!,"Avid fan of this author and pit her up there with my other top favorites of Patricia Cornwell, Mary Higgins Clark, and Sandra Brown. Would definitely recommend all her books!"
4,A good Second book in the Disk World set,"I like this book more then the first. It is a fun book to read, with some intersting twists."
4,Another fun chronicle of the Discworld.....,"Terry Pratchett's Discworld does for Fantasy what Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy did for science fiction--firmly sets a story within a genre, stereotypes intact, then goes to town. This third instrallment is only loosely connected to the previous two, in that it features many of the same settings and a few minor characters, but you could easily read it on its own. I'm reading through the series in order because that's how I'm wired, but you don't need to.A wizard is born the eighth son of an eighth son, and such a birth is at hand as a wizard nearing his end travels to the mountain village of Bad Ass to hand over his staff to the newborn lad. Only too late do they realize that he has just ordained the Disc's first ever female wizard.....This was good. I preferred the first two DW novels to this one, but I'm seeing in the other reviews that the opposite view is just as popular, so take that how you will."
4,Another excellent Pratchett work,I love the witches and they are at some of their best in this novel. A must read if you are a Discworld fan.
5,Granny is great!,As always Terry Pratchett and Granny Weatherwax save the day or perhaps the world in this uproariously funny tale of the disc world. Is. GRANNY getting a suitor a love interest. OMG I've got to read the next one
4,Big smile!,As usual Pratchett is thought provoking AND funny.it was an easy read that belies the truth and depth of its message.
5,First & best so far,"This was the 1st Pratchett book I EVER bought and read VOLUNTARILY. Note the 'voluntarily'. It takes a great author and a great book to make ME actually spend money on a book. Since I read that book, Granny has become my favourite character on the entire disc (well, joint with Death), and I have BOUGHT AND READ her continuing adventures in Wyrd Sisters, Witches Abroad and Lords and Ladies all becuase of this book. Only one thing - when can we see the return of Esk?"
3,Sorry to rate it so low but I expected more from Pratchett,"well I've read many of his books before and I do beleive that he is a great author. His stories are funny, interesting and, I'm sure many people would agree, smart. But this one in particular kind of drags on and unlike his other works that I've read it doesn't have as much spontenaity (spontenaiety?) as I've come to expect. Still had this been a budding author it would have merited 4 and a half stars but since it is Terry Pratchett he has a higher standard to live up to (sorry but you brought it on yourself Terry). Still if you enjoy reading discworld novels then get it. I have it and don't regret paying for it because it helps build up on the discworld experience. I guess that the only reason that this novel is not as high class as his others may be because it is only his third of the series (it is the third isn't it?) anyway still a good book but not his best work. recomended but only slightly to non-Pratchett fans"
4,Go Girl!,"Yet another of Pratchett's wonderful yarns. I am especially fond of Granny Weatherwax. Lots of laughs, lots of fun, lots of references. :)"
5,A story of witches and wizards...,"Great read, typical Terry Pratchett story, where a young lady together with Granny Wetherwax, begins her journey into the world of witchcraft and wizardry. This was my first book with Granny, and i must say that she is one of the finest characters from the Terry Pratchett universe."
5,Gift,"My best friend loves Terry Pratchett! Got the ones she didn't have for Christmas! If she wants more, I'll get them for her!"
4,a bit disappointing,"After reading The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic, I knew I was completely hooked on Discworld. However, the third in this series, while still a fun read, was a bit disappointing after the first two. I will say that I was glad to find some interesting female characters after the distinct lack of them in the first two novels. Particularly, Granny Weatherwax is a hoot, and she alone make this book worth reading. My main complaint was that Equal Rites rushed toward the ending a little too fast. The ending ""battle"" and climax didn't live up to the expectations I had built up in the rest of the novel. Also, Equal Rites didn't have as many uproariously funny moments as the first two. Still, if you like Discworld, this book is certainly worth reading."
2,Not one of Pratchett's best,"I've been reading the Discworld series in order, so naturally I read Equal Rites third. (I think. It's third, right?) I think it was a good book in general, but compared to Pratchett's other wonderful books, it fell very short of its mark. There was very little humor in the book, and I didn't feel that any of the characters were realistic or appealing in any way. Granny Weatherwax is possibly the most unappealing character I've come across in Discworld so far. But for hardcore Pratchett fans, read this book anyway, because frankly, you have to. You've got to read them all. :) But if you're new to Pratchett, stear clear of Equal Rites. It's rather boring."
3,Granny without Nanny? Pass.,"One of Pratchett's early books, and our first sighting of Granny Weatherwax. Unfortunately, without Nanny Ogg or Magrat she is left 2-dimensional and lifeless on the page. Much like ""Guards, Guards"" the book has the felling of not knowing what it wants to be and the characters don't know who they are. The face off against sex discrimination in the wizarding world might make for an interesting story, but if it does you'd have to look for it in another book, this one's dull (for Pratchett)."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This Discworld book didn't interest me as much, but it is ok. It is your girl sort of ends up wanting to be a wizard, but the all male faculty at the Unseen University don't really know how to deal with the whole situation, and don't necessarily want to, either.Enter the hard-nosed grandma witch of the girl to sort of all the bumbling robe wearing conjurers."
4,Magic is fun!,"In addition to being very much fun like all the other Discworld novels, this one gives new inside to the magic that dwells in Discworld. The main person is a girl who a wizard mistakenly belive to be a boy when she is born and therefor passes on his magic onto her as he dies. The big question on both the wizards and Death lips is, can there be such a thing as a female wizard? The girl decides that she will grow up to bee both a wizard and a witch, and starts on a long journey filled with humorus obstacles..."
4,Introducing Granny Weatherwax,"EQUAL RITES introduces Granny Weatherwax, a witch with a problem. Eska, a young girl has received a wizard's magical abilities as she was thought to be the eighth son of an eighth son. As you can tell she is lacking in the ""son"" part and the difficulty is that girls can't become wizards. Or so it has always been, until Granny gets involved. Offering to take Eska to The Unseen University, this witch finds herself in some unfamiliar territory, but through sheer determination, intelligence and not just a little bit of her own magical ability, Granny finds a way to set things right. Granny's a great character for Discworld; just the right combination of sass, intelligence and common sense to put most of the characters around her to shame. While I found the story's ending to be a bit abrupt, I think Granny will always be a character that remains interesting."
5,bought as a gift,"I bought this book as a gift. As far as I know, it was exactly what was wanted and the person is very happy that received it."
4,Granny = great,"This book is a very worthy book in the Discworld series, not least because it is the first appearance of Granny Weatherwax, who along with Nanny Ogg and Magrat, are my favourite of all terry pratchett's characters. The witches books are simply the best.This one has a great premise...a girl who is destined to be a wizard. Will she become one, or will the chauvinistic ""lore"" stand in her way? It's not quite as funny as some of the other discworld books, but when it is, it's hilarious.This is quite a dark book, really, and pterry is often at his best when he is dark. In this case, it is perhaps not so. However, this is still a great, with an inventive and amusing premise, which more than satisfactorily carries the tale to it's conclusion. Lovely. The only thing i dont like about the first few Pratchett books is that they're so short!"
4,"Not the best, but a great read anyway","Welcome to a different and slightly less chaotic Discworld and meet our new hero, Esk, the eigth DAUGHTER of an eigth son, who, unfortunately for the wizards, was supposed to be a son.Esk starts her career in magic learning the ways of the Witch from old Granny Weatherwax, but after an almost fatal Borrowing Granny decides she must take Esk to the University. It is at the University where she meets Simon, the brilliant young wizard-to-be, and they encounter some very dark forces of their imaginations..."
4,Rite On,"This is the first Discworld book that I happened to read even though I own about 12 of them. I didn't realize it was out of order until the last page but even then I didn't really care. The story of Esk and her struggle to be a wizard is filled with great subtle humor and puns throughout. Pratchett has given life to a world filled with magic and witches and wizards that compares with those of Terry Brooks. I would agree with other reviews which claim the ending came a little quickly. The story is without a solid ending but being the first book in the series that I have read, that may come later. The journey through the book is well worth the trip."
3,"Not as good as The Light Fantastic, however...","I had just finished reading The light Fantastic, and that book managed to keep a smile at my face with every page. Not so with this book. Although the basic premise is great, this book is a lot slower than the first two novels. Yes, the characters are still great, and some of the jokes WILL make you laugh. I just hoped they would come up just as often as the first two books.Do I recommend this book? Yes. The characters and the jokes are still good enough to warrant both your money and your time (then again, 213 pages isn't much)"
4,A conquering novel in the line of equality for all!,The eighth son of an eighth son is on a mission to become the first female wizard in Ankh Morpork because the wizard who brought the child onto the Disc did not bother to check if it was a boy or a girl. The wizard tld the parents that the child was to become a wizard and so the parents had to follow this rule. It is a great revolutionary novel which introduces the reader to both equality and Terry Practhett.
4,First read last,"I find myself reading the Diskworld novels in reverse order, but to my great pleasure, unlike, say, the Dragon Lance series, it doesn't matter. Every book is exquisite and fun to read. Although I'm never quite sure if I'm pronouncing many of the names correctly, the characters are people (trolls, witches, wizards, dwarfs) that I would like to meet. Equal Rites is no exception. This is not a `bash you over the head with a high concept' book--the gentle, sometimes hysterical humor makes the point.Where are the movies?"
4,Disappointing for Pratchett.,"Having previously read the magnificent books The Colour Of Magic and The Light Fantastic, I expected great things of Equal Rites. However, this book has one main fault: Granny bloody Weatherwax. Although she is a very funny character at times, Equal Rites focuses too much upon her and seems to be forgetting (for most of this book) other characters, apart from Esk. I say that this book is dissapointing, but were this written by any author other than Pratchett, it would be regarded as a masterpiece. Sorry, but Terry is such a good author that he has to reach a very high standard if he wants to equal the brilliance of other novels such as Mort or The Light Fantastic."
5,Favorite Pratchett books,Equal Rites places a girl in a man's job in a man's world. Pratchett is great at holding up a mirror to our world; it's both funny and painful see the reflection.
3,Love Granny Weatherwas but...,I love the character of Granny Weatherwax but unfortunately this book just loses momentum somewhere along the line. Esk is a great character who should have been filled out more. I found the ending of the book very confusing. It also ended rather abruptly.
5,Better than I expected,I bought these to supplement ones that I have lost in the 40 years since I got them as a wedding present. I was delighted when they came in and were even better quality than the originals. Great service and a wonderful product at a reasonable price.
5,One of the best Sports Songs Ever,"This song, being techno and whatnot, must be one of the best sports songs ever written (right up there with ""Let's Get Ready to Rumble"" and other Jock Jams Songs). When I first heard this, I instantly wanted to pick up a basketball and start playing to the beat. Take it from me, a guy who listens to contemporary piano music, that this song will get you tapping to the beat (99% guaranteed)."
3,Nothing great,"The exercises are extremely basic, and if you really are to do this with your baby as the book suggests, the baby has to be of an age when he/she can sit up on his/her own. By then you would really not be interested in doing such basic exercises. So, as a book for exercises, it is really a waste of money. But if you want a book that is baby friendly and has large bright shapes printed on stiff paper, you might consider this book. But of course, there are far better ones out there for that purpose! (There are only basic shapes like triangle, square, spiral, star, etc.)"
1,Stroller Fit review,"If you are looking for a workout, this is not the book to buy. It basically has shapes and not a workout for the mom. Not worth it!"
5,beautiful music,"This CD has been a pleasant surprise. I had heard about Fux because he was quoted in Hindemith's Craft of Music, and then read in Mozart's bio that W.A. studied from Fux's book on counterpoint. So I wanted to hear some of his music.With this CD, the price is right of course, and the organ soundfiles really caught my ears. After having this for about 4 weeks, I have been listening to it non-stop. If all you have heard from Baroque is the usual suspects (Bach, Vivaldi, Teleman, Handel) you owe it to yourself check this recording out, there is a lot to it that is not in these other composers.Fux is quite a writer of counterpoint. I especially like the trombone ensembles. The performing group gives a very heartfelt first rate performance. I definitely am going to track down more recordings from this ensemble."
4,Amazing!,"This is the first time I read a ""Charmed"" book and I was really surprised by its content. It compares favorably with the TV series since even the expressions used by the personages remind you of the series. A good book!"
4,Dancemaia Delux 3,This a great CD for anyone who is a fan of DDR. It contains numerous full length songs used early in the series as well as some classic Dancemania songs. It also comes with a nonstop megamix CD that the Dancemania series is known for having.
4,Handbook of Northwestern Plants,I may refer to this book occasionally and I will give it to my granddaughter when she has reached a higher level in school. It is a little too scientific for me. The colorful illustrations which I love are absent from this book.
3,Not the best Slackers,"I was a little disappointed with this album. After listening to ""Live at Ernesto's"" this just wasn't the same caliber. While there are some good songs, I thought the majority of the album just didn't rock, for lack of a better word. Hope this helps!"
1,To bad - even if its freee,Translation is ok as far as I can see...BUT the formatting and lay-out in the Kindle versionis disastrous... the spirit of Verlaine is gone...Buy Verlaine as a REAL book.Free - in this case - means bad!Amazon wake up...And why cant I give it 0 stars?
1,The movie does not match the reviews,"The reviews are clearly for an entirely different movie, or set of movies. Amazon needs to fix this. Please match the correct movie with the correct reviews."
3,"LED good, Halogen bad","While the LED lamps in the rear light are bright and preserve battery life wonderfully, the Halogen lamp in the front, strangely, *isn't* very bright, and draws so hard one has to change batteries weekly, if using it for approximately an hour a day (and this is with C batteries!). Also, the front light is large and clunky. If Sylvania ever replaces the front light with an LED and a smaller case, this will be a great set. As it is now, it's barely worth the batteries needed."
5,Wonderful original color pictures of ETO WWII aircraft,"Jeffrey Ethell put together a wonderful collection of original WWII vintage color pictures of military aircraft, primarily from the European Theater of Operations. The book is light on text, but the pictures more than make up for this shortcoming. Mr. Ethell, who unfortunately died in a crash of a P-38 in 1997, was a foremost authority of military aircraft and amassed an amazing collection of color photographs from WWII. Just a small fraction of these are displayed in this wonderful book. If you are a fan of WWII military aircraft, this book is a must for your collection."
5,Innovative & Essential,"Impressive scolarship, essential interpretation for a better understandingof the Postclassic Maya. It had the same access to bits of mis-remembered orbadly interpreted ideas that my first viewings of Tatiana Proskouriakoff'sreconstruction drawings of Maya architecure produced. Even after 45 years oftrudging around Measoamerica in an attempt to track down and film any and allsites that can be reached I realise that my obsession is beginning all over again."
3,artsy. bold. ambitious. worth one viewing,Repeative. Heard mixed reviews and decided to give it a chance. Liked the different variations on the theme in difference cultures. Felt likie a Woody Allen work but not sure if it was worth the time spent in the end. Worth a viewing to form your own opinion.
4,"not his best, but we're talking about a genius","Hal Hartley is way ahead of his time. This is not his best film, but it's definitely worth watching. I first saw an excerpt in a sociology/religion class which hooked me: advice on love and commitment in a bathroom. This film takes chances, and some of them aren't that entertaining, but overall it's not as bad as elsewhere reviewed on this site."
1,Flirt Flop,"I got this movie because Parker Posey was in it, but to my dismay it was only for about 10 seconds. I was also unaware that this was by the same guy who made that AWFUL movie, Henry Fool. What can I say? This movie was the pits. The concept was good, but Mr. Hartley is not skilled enough as a filmmaker to execute it. Recommendation: don't bother. A waste of time as well as a waste of money."
1,Hal Hartley-no thanks,"I dont feel like wasting my time writing a review here, but I want to warn you to skip films from someone who can make even the bubbliest of people, Parker Posey, dull. Skip it, this and Henry Fool, but not Amateur"
3,Cute toy,"This is a really cute toy, I really like the wooden toys. We are trying to purchase more natural and toxic free toys for our children, but I am having a hard time determining if this toy is toxin free."
4,"Carter takes getting used to, but","The music may sound at first cliched in its clangor, but given full attention and many listenings, one begins to pick up on the lushness of the writing (which can be completely missed with just a few cursory listenings). The man is over ninety and he's going strong. He just completed his first opera this year."
5,Porsche performances at a VW price. What more could you ask?,Gorgeous performances of quintessential Carter. Played as lovingly as if it were Brahms. Spend five bucks and play it a few times and you'll fall in love with the music and the performances. Oppens and Gielen are treasures.
2,Such a Disappointment!,"What a disappointment! I was so looking forward to reading this book and recommended it to my book club.It started off great - a 40ish single woman who encounters Mary, Mother of Jesus in her living room, wearing a trench coat and running shoes. Doesn't this sound good? But then it proceeds to a run-on account of various shrines/sightings. There is no interaction to speak of between the two.There are so many better books out there!!!"
2,A book for history buffs,"Unless you are an avid reader of ancient and/or religious history you will probably find this book rambling and boring. If you were expecting an insight into Mary's life, whether fact or fiction, this is not the book for you. The author's previous stories were excellent, but this was a real disappointment."
1,Disappointment,"My disappointment came because I was expecting a whimsical, humorous novel around the idea of Mary coming to visit. Instead, the ""novel"" was a thinly veiled attempt to describe lots of Mary's apparitions, something I could have researched on my own, had I been so inclined. I am a faithful Catholic with a devotion to Mary, so my disappointment was strictly based on unfulfilled expectations. The author's style became tedious after awhile as well. The narrator is an author who talks about her own weaknesses, such as too many distracting specifics, and that was precisely what the author did in this book. Toward the end, she became highly philosophical and abstract, just adding to my disappointment for anticipating a whimsical story."
3,Thoughts the book,"Clever idea for a book, amusing at times and occasionally thought provoking, but tends to bog down a bit with too many historical incidents of Mary sightings, etc."
2,Kind of a letdown,"I have to agree with all the other reviewers who found so much promise in the premise and in the first few chapters of this book. About 1/4 of the way through it, I really loved it and even recommended it to others. The idea of Mary visiting an ordinary woman seemed so mystical and warm at the same time. But halfway through it I've started to skim pages; at the third ""History"" chapter, I groaned out loud. The two separate stories in this book - a visit from Mary and an exploration into philosophy and theology - weren't blended well enough for me to continue to feel excited about this book. I'll do my best to finish it, but I'm already disappointed."
1,Almost turned me into an atheist,"Proof positive that an interesting idea can make a mundane, tedious book. The real miracle here? That I finished it...."
2,"Great start, but...","it surely did not hold up. I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. The author's use of humor and and her descriptive ability really pulled me in. But not long into the book it got quite historical and factual, which I found interesting at first, but too repetetive with the frequent references to the Mary sightings. For me, that is what caused the book to lose its appeal. Occassionally I am interested in reading about Mary visitations, miracles, etc., but it wasn't what I picked up this book for, which was purely pleasure reading and escapism."
2,Frustrating,"I got this book wanting something more from it!! I thought this would be a great book after reading ""Looking for Mary"" by Beverly Donofrio which I LOVED! But Our Lady of the Lost & Found does not come close to Beverly's book. The writing style is somewhat redundant to the point of frustration. I found my self skipping over sentences and sometimes pages to reach her point. My problem may be that it is a novel and I did know that going into reading it. The parts of the book that I found enjoyable were the bits and pieces of history that were obviously very researched and told nicely. But the over-all story was drab and uninspiring."
3,Soul Searching,"Imagine finding yourself coming face to face with a mysterious stranger standing in your living room! Dressed in a blue raincoat and wearing white Nikes, she bears a remarkable resemblance to pictures you may have seen of the Virgin Mary. Could this just be the Catholic upbringing coming to haunt you or is she real?Diane Schoemperlene delves into the mystery that is the Virgin Mary over the last few thousand years by making her real to the reader. Just like you or I she needs a place to rest her weary self and recover from the many demands made upon her. Mary becomes a part of the author's life for one week bringing the mystery that is her life into the present day.I found the history in this book of great interest and I can honestly say it has left me wondering. Are thesightings real or a product of imagination? I leave you to draw your own conclusions"
2,Frustrating,"I have to agree with most of the negative reviews here. This book was frustrating to deal with; more of a chore than an interesting read. I did not like the way the non-fiction was interspersed throughout the story. It interrupted the flow of the novel and the development of the plot, of which there was shockingly little. The character of Mary was not well-developed in the context of her visit. Instead, the author chose to focus almost exclusively on historical apparitions rather than the one that she herself had the opportunity to create. And while I realize Mary has appeared in numerous incarnations, the apparitions seemed to bear little relationship to the Mary who appeared in the main character's living room.Disconnected and underdeveloped. I don't recommend this book."
3,Too meandering,"Great concept, but the author rambles off too often. I found myself skipping entire chapters which had nothing to do with the story. Where was the editor? I enjoyed the historical facts and loved the idea of the Virgin Mary coming to spend a week at a regular person's home."
2,"Interesting plot, but involves some weird things","The story is interesting, a doll that comes to life, but the way she was brought to life is a bit disturbing. I didn't like Casey's obsessions with magic. The chanting part was kind of strange. It made me feel uncomfortable."
3,LIFE SIZE,THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THE MOVIE IS WIERD. EVE SUCKS BADLY. BUY THE SIMPSONS DVD ON SEPTEMBER .

1,"Horrid, Horrid, Horrid!","I will never ever touch this horrid movie again.In this movie under all the goody goody, they have witchcraft.I am 14 but this movie is not near worth giving my email address for. My name is Caroline and I hate this movie"
4,Lindsay and Tyra,We really enjoyed the movie. Tyra Banks surprised with her singing. We kept singing Eve's theme for days after we saw the movie. Cool! Cute. Fresh. And filled with moral lessons to parents!!! Worth buying it.
4,tipsy,life size was one of lindsay lohans best movie out there. which features a nice apperance from tyra banks.
4,phenomenal,this was a phenomenal movie from lindsay lohan. so if you like her other movies like the parent trap you must see this one.
4,wonderful,go and see this movie for yourself. it's one of the best lindsay lohan movie ive ever seen. and lindsay and tyra make good chemistry.
2,How Dumb,"I thought this would be a pretty good movie cuz the main charecters are 14 yr old Lindsay Lohan from The Parent Trap and the fasion model Tyra Banks. But it was actually a kind of stupid movie, I think it would fit girls under 12 who are the ones most likelt to be the ones to still play with barbies. Cuz it's basically about a barbie who comes to life (im surprised they didnt make the barbie a blonde since she was acting so dumb when she came to life!....not to be mean to us blondes or anything...) and she lives her life with Casey (Lindsay) as sort of a mother figure."
1,PROOF THAT DISNEY DOES MAKE CHEESE,"I WORK IN A PRESCHOOL. ONE FRIDAY WHEN ONE OF OUR STUDENTS BROUGHT THIS MOVIE IN FOR SHOW & TELL, WE WATCHED IT THAT AFTERNOON. NOW THE YOUNG GIRL IN THE MOVIE WAS VERY GOOD, BUT EVERYTHING WAS JUST FALLING APART AROUND HER. BASICALLY THE MOVIE SHOULD COME ACROSS AS LAME TO ANYONE THAT ISN'T PRESCHOOL AGE OR YOUNGER. EVEN WHEN I TRIED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE THROUGH THE EYES OF A SMALL CHILD, I COULDN'T GET PASSED THE ULTRA CHEESE. 2BAD I HAD NO CRACKERS."
4,Cute kids film,"This is a nice movie starring Lindsay Lohan at a time of her life before she was in all kinds of trouble, and is about a lonely girl who wants a friend, so her doll comes to life. It sounds cheesy and cliched to some, but this was actually a pretty cute movie, though it is definitely not for everyone. Personally, it's more of a movie to rent, but is fun watching."
5,One of my favorite movies as a kid,"This movie is great, its really funny and has great actors. I watched this all the time when I was younger and I still like watching it now"
5,GOTTA LOVE LINDSAY LOHAN =),"This movie is so cute and funny. I was suprised Tyra Banks acted so well. No suprise Lindsay did. Highly reccommend this movie. Your kids will love it. Also reccommend Lindsay's other movies...The Parent Trap, Get A Clue, Freaky Friday, Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen, Mean Girls, Herbie Fully Loaded, Just My Luck, A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby"
2,Interesting premise badly flawed,The basic premise of a group of women who can see the future one of who is captured by a pirate and forced to predict where a treasure convoy is going to be. Unfortunately there is more brutality than erotica. The only saving feature is an interesting Deau ex Machina conclusion. Overall not up to par for the genre.
5,Ambient Classic,"Biosphere and HIA created a classic Ambient Cd, by making polar sequences. It's one long trip, one moment you're in the middle of a boring reception, the next on the edge of a melting glacier. If you like Biosphere, this CD is a must-have; if you don't, maybe Polar Sequeces will make you change your mind. And I mean chill. Difficult to find though..."
4,My Angel,"This album was my first exposure to Angela Bofill and is still one of my favorites by her. Her unique voice, jazzy-soul style, and meaningful lyrics are always a joy and are forever in style. In an age where I listen to new music with one finger on the ""Skip Track"" button, it is a relief to once again have access to an album that you can put on and just slowly fall in love with a truely wonderful talent."
4,One Of her Best --,"""Angel of the Night"" released in 1979 perfectly showcases Bofill's beautiful voice and impeccable interpretation. The last of her two GRP albums, Angel displayed what a perfect team Larry Rosen, Dave Grusin, and Bofill were. ""I Try"", ""The Feelin's Love"" and ""The Voyage"" and truly powerful songs that complement Bofill's alto to a T. I recommend getting all of Bofill's albums, but this and ""Angie"" should start off your collection."
4,Sometimes Cliches Speak,"The previous reviewer complains this book is riddled with cliches about how rock n' roll developed from the intersection of blues and hillbilly music. I think for many readers this will be less a cliche than a revelation. Consider the audience this book is aimed at...after all it does have ""Rolling Stone"" in the title, and was doubtless not aimed at music academia. This reviewer quickly dismisses the book but does not provide any contrary facts or insights into the subject. Me thinks he protest too much. This can serve as a nice overall history of rock n' roll, although being 20 years old it probably could use a few pages of update."
3,An exciting and sad book.,"The Bomb mostly takes place on the Bikini Atoll during the 1940's. It is about the government wanting to use Sorry's homeland as a nuclear test site. The characters are Sorry,his granfather,and his uncle. Many events occured in the book. One important event was that the government wanted to use the Bikini Aoll as a test site. Because of this another important event occured. This event was Abraham,Sorry's uncle, wanted to save the Bikini Atoll."
2,The Bomb,"The Bomb is a good book to read. Me, myself i did not enjoy the book because I don't like the war, holocaust, true story style of reading. This book is on the making of the atomic bomb and the test sight were the main charector Sorry Rinamu lives on a small island known as Bikini. This story explanes how the island of Bikini had to turn off all the lights so that the small island was not bombed at night. I did not like the main charestors name Sorry. The reason that I did not like his name because it kind of made a depressing setting throughout the story."
1,"Dull, boring, slow and a waste of my time","This factual novel by Theodore Taylor takes place on the small Bikini Atoll in the western Pacific that has been chosen to be the test site of the atomic bomb. A boy on the atoll, Sorry, is suddenly caught in the middle of a debate between the Americans and the Bikinians on whether to relocate or not. Sorry is soon informed by his uncle that the Americans are up to no good and if the Bikinians relocate that more than likely they will never see their island again. This book isn't very good because it was slow and hard to follow. I would not recommend this book to kids or teens."
4,The BoMb,"This book starts out with a sixteen year old named Sorry and his family, that live on a samll island called Bikini.When Sorry and his family hear that the U.S is going to use this island as an atomic bomb testing site they dont want to leave and belive that they can stop the U.S. He trys to reason with some of the U.S soldiers but was unsuccessful.The author shows great determination though the character Sorry.The book is very descriptive and shows the reality of droping bombs in an area where humans live.Theodore Taylor's novel is action packed and is definatly worth reading."
5,I Recommend Reading it!,"If you like action books you would like ""The Bomb."" I would recommend it to any age group if you are into actions. It is about a boy and the Americans wanting to use Bikini Island for a bomb test site."
4,The Bomb is a intresting histrocial fiction book,"I believe this book is a very intresting book about how a family is forced by the U.S. goverment to leave their island, Bikini Atoll, because of nuclear testing. The goverment told Sorry and his family they just need to borrow their island for testing and they can come back to their homeland in 2 years. Later on Sorry find out a lot of information about the bomb and all the lies the Navy have told him and his family. He decides to think of a plan to stop the bomb. He does but will it work?I believe this is a very good about historical fiction. This book won the Scott O'dell award for Historical Fiction. I also believe this is a good book for young readers. If you like a book with many facts and a lot of fiction. Please read The Bomb by Theodore Taylor."
4,Inside The Bomb,"The story takes place on Bikini Atoll in the Western Pacific in the late 1940's. Sixteen year old Sorry Rinamu,his grandfather Jonjen and Tara Malolo,the school teacher are caught in the middle of government experiments on atomic bombs. The government was testing atomic bombs on Bikini Atoll, but before the first test began the government relocated all of the inhabitants of the island to another island in the Atolls.As the government prepares to begin the first atomic bomb test, Sorry, his grandfather and Tara Malolo sail back to Bikini in an attempt to stop the tests.I thought that this was a well written book about an actual event combined with the creativity of Theodore Taylor's mind and his experience. Theodore Taylor was in the Navy and a part of the experiment at Bikini Atoll. He thought that the experiment was pointless and that it ruined a culture. I agree."
4,The bomb,"I recommend this book to anyone who is 10 years and older because this book has facts about the atomic bomb and when they were building it so some of the words are very hard to pronounce. Certain parts of this book are very surprising and exciting, like when Sorry said to everyone, "" I am going out to the reef and I am going to catch a shark and bring it back here and show everyone that I am not a little boy any more."" While Sorry was trying to spear the shark, it struggled to get away and it dragged him under. He wasn't able to breath, but finally he cut the line and swam to the surface. Another reason I enjoyed the book was that it showed people working together. Abram came on to the island and walked up to Sorry and said, ""Tomorrow we are going to the Enyu channel and we are going to hunt down a tiger shark.''Although they did not catch the shark they worked together to find it. I liked this book because it was fun to read and there was some action."
2,Not a very accurate historical account,"A simple story. Lacks truth of real life living in the pacific. The author should have visited how the place appears before writing this book, even though this is a fictional work."
3,Boring,"The only thing that was good about this book was the end.It gave great details about the people on the island but I lost intrest.I love the end, you can just picture it the way he discribes it. Its not worth buying but it is worth reading."
5,A Great Book about Atomic Bomb History,This a great book for anybody who wants to know the pre history and testing of the A-Bomb. It maybe part fictional but you can really tell how the people of Bikini felt.
4,The one that I love! Yeah!,"A very good CD! Air Supply's second album in the US (sixth album total), this showcases their many talents. They have skills from the ballads like ""I Want To Give It All"" and ""The One That You Love"" to the more upbeat songs like ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""This Heart Belongs To Me"". ""Keeping The Love Alive"" and ""Here I Am"" are kinda sappy (okay, really sappy), but they're just so... you know. This album reached #2 on the charts, and included many Top Five Hits. Not to mention the title track, which became their only #1 hit. Worth a listen!"
1,"Bummer from word ""go""","After looking all over for ""Air Supply - The One That You Love"" CD, I found it here. Almost wish I hadn't. About the only thing NOT wrong with this order WAS the packaging. The song title listings (numbers) on the CD cover DO NOT match the sequence in which they appear on the CD. The end of the tracks on the CD overlap the beginning of the next track by as much as 20 seconds; with the last track ""I've Got Your Love"" (#10 on the CD; #7 on the cover) being cut short by about 20 seconds."
5,HE'S THE BEST !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I HAVE ALMOST ALL THE ALBUMS HE'S EVER MADE. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST OUT OF ALL OF THEM.MAYBE ITS BECAUSE THERE ALL NEW SONGS.
3,overly simple,"This is a good cookbook for beginners, or those who do not have access to a wide variety of Chinese ingredients. However, it doesn't have enough going on to hold the attention of more experienced cooks. Most dishes are flavored with ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and rice wine--and not much else. Like many other British-published cookbooks I've had, it is stripped to the minimum. Still, it's a good primer, with clear instructions and good pictures."
5,Classic Classix,"Ahh,the memories this CD brought back, haunting melodies, my teenage years, I can finally ditch the warped tape I had & listen, again with a wry smile on my face. yes this is probably not everyones' cup of Earl grey, however, it suits me just fine. some of the tracks I have on single Vinyl...I wonder how much those are worth?"
4,NIGHT PEOPLE,This is a very good album indeed. It fits perfectly within the new romantics era of the early eighties. Beside it has that darkclimate and mysterious atmosphere that makes in stand out. The vocals and musical mood are perfect for the time it was issued.
4,Looking Back- This is a strong collection of songs!,"The first song I heard off of this beautifulalbum is ""You Should Know By Now"" around '81in my teens. I can say without a doubt thisalbum is one of her strongest collections. Theonly dud was ""Holding Out For Love."" It's asong made for ""Flashdance"" not Angela. I alsoloved the newly unearthed ""Lovelight"" which isa holdover from the ""Angel of The Night"" sessions."
3,BOFILL SHINES ON THE BALLADS,"ON THE TITLE SONG, BOFILL DELIVERS. THE UPTEMPO POP STUFF ON THIS CD SHOULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. BUY THIS ONLY FOR THE AWESOME BALLADS BY THE QUEEN OF QUIET STORM (SINCE THE 1995 DEATH OF PHYLLIS HYMAN)."
4,"Pursuant to misterb's comment,","it also doesn't tell you how to cite to sandwiches, borscht, shoelaces, or beeswax. I was eating some borscht and wanted to know how to cite it MLA style, but the book wouldn't tell me!!!"
2,Un-Challenging and Un-Creative,"This book is almost too easy, and the author has put in very little effort in his quest to offer thought-provoking scenarios of alternative history. He is a competent historian, and offers well-researched treatises on historical events and how they really happened. Unfortunately, the second half of each chapter, in which he attempts to get creative and speculate on what could have been, are where Steve Tally shows real weaknesses as a writer. Most of his ""what-if"" scenarios are not very creative at all, and fail to challenge your perceptions of the forces of history, which happens to be what he's trying to achieve. Notable exceptions are the chapter speculating on what would have happened to Bill Gates if the hadn't made an early business deal with IBM, and what would have become of Dan Quayle if Bush had dropped him from the presidential ticket."
3,"Spice, but no meat!","This book is neither a Turtledove-style alternative-history-novel, nor a ""Virtual History"" speculation by Niall Ferguson, but a collection of after-dinner mind-games. Pieces from American history with a short speculative ""what if?"" tale added for spice. Their style is that of a journalist's report, not that of a historian or novelist. This makes for easy reading, perhaps suitable for a transatlantic flight but not something to spend too much time on.What is really lacking is a uniform approach to the historical sitations and subsequent speculation reported. Sometimes those are inconsequential to the further progress of history, then they are turning points which change everything. Why, the reader won't learn. In the end Bill Gates will always end up owning the computer industry ... . So there is spice, but no meat ..."
3,JUST OK,"This one definitely shows how a writer improves over time. I also am having trouble getting used to this reader's voice and how he depicts the voices of the other characters, especially ""Mouse"" Ok, I don't like it and it was distracting. I'm not reading the series in order, unfortunately, and I prefer the voices of the later readers to this gentleman."
3,2008 Reprint Full of Typos,"It appears that the editor of the 2008 edition may have been sampling the recipes while on the job. I was shocked by the number of typos, which can make reading the book a rather frustrating endeavor. In some cases, words are replaced by similar-sounding words, and one must backtrack to make sense of things.(I don't know exactly how books are published these days, but I assume that a computer is involved and that it should be a simple exercise for a competent proofreader to make corrections using some form of text editor prior to publication. Of course, it is entirely possible that these errors were present in previous editions, but there is no reason why they shouldn't be corrected.)Nonetheless, we should be grateful that this classic is now available as an affordable and otherwise finely executed reprint."
5,Back in print! :),"There are many books around about ""bartending"" or ""cocktails"", but Embury's TFAoMD (1948) is the definitive work when it comes to mixing drinks, and it was a delight to see that it is back in print. Don't bother with any other books on the subject. Original editions of this work, in good shape, sell for a couple of hundred dollars, if you can even find them!Not only does Embury describe the principles of a mixed drink, and the equipment that is useful in its preparation, but he also describes each base ingredient, each mixer and how to mix to get the best result. He also provides recipes for six basic cocktails and the practical possibilities in making your own.There is also a chapter concerning ""The Use and Abuse of Liquor"", so you could argue that this is even a moral work.TFAoMD is educational, entertaining, practical and an essential addition to the library of the serious mixologist. Moreover, it is beautifully written. What more could you ask for...?"
5,A must have for those serious about learning to mix drinks,"If you just want a book with lots of recipe lists, this isn't your book, though it has plenty of those. If you want to know why certain types of drinks work and how to create your own, this book is indispensable. The man is genius, and his commentary about certain drinks is absolutely refreshing.I first came across this book (1952 without illustrations) in my dad's library. I've purchased and used many other bartending books and guides and always keep coming back to Mr. Embury. He never disappoints and his personal versions of cocktails always please.If everyone who served cocktails had a copy of this book, the notion of a cocktail party being simply ""beer and wine"" would be a thing of the past."
1,This product is no longer available,"When you order this product you will get a harbor bay product. It's not the same! George Foreman is not availabe via causale male even though this web site says that the product is ""in stock""."
4,"***** for all of the disc, except the poor Dove","Great music, great performances. Kubelik does this music wonderfully, but he has dry engineering by DG (drat!), and perhaps not the world's best orchestra. From the first notes of this disc, you'd have to listen hard to not think that SWF SO isn't world class (although clearly their work can be uneven; their Janacek Sinfonietta on the same label reveals many orchestral weaknesses). The Water Sprite is gripping. The Noonday Witch, a personal favorite, is quite well done--I prefer it to Kubelik. The Wood Dove is fine, but not up to the level of the Sprite and the Witch. Zinman gives a rousing performance of In Nature's Realm. The sound is great! If you don't know this music, try this disc. You'll get hooked and wonder why such great music is practically ignored...."
2,Two great highlights in this package for me!,"Came across this by browsing through my little brother's record collection. Now the song that jumps out of this collection for me is `Think back & remember', which was a BIG tune, on the rare groove scene, back in the 90's. This is one of the few vocal songs on this project, and it still sounds fresh. So I explored the rest, by putting this onto my mini disc player. The other song that I grew to love was' Magic lady', which is a vibrant instrumental cut, which I love to death. The remaining songs are OK, nothing more really."
3,O.K.,"First off I am a huge fan of Lorber, I love his Jazz side. This CD is a mix of Jazz and Funk witch is o.k. for me, but I don't care for some of the songs. I could not hear samples of this one, otherwise I don't think I would have bought it. The price is also to high, as always this is just my opinion."
1,Didn't work,The product never seemed to work for us. Applied and soaked up according to directions but cat pee smell remained.
1,Doesnt work for me,"Had a neighbor's not neutered cat wandering our yard and that Ok with me, But NOT with my kitties. Started marking inside when they come in for the night. Used as directed, smell kept coming back & my cats are neutered. I found strong vinegar & water solution did the trick and way cheaper, folks!"
2,car repair,This book does not cover all the needs for someone who is wanting to repair a Toyota Celica--limited pictures and virtually no information about the convertible.
4,Haynes Toyota Celica repair manual,"Good book with very much useful information for anyone attempting minor to major car repair. Would not be without it, but also got a Chilton's manual for comparison reference. Like them both and cross-referenced both books for recent starter and stereo projects."
2,"Does not define vocabulary words, it only translates them.","The book translates a word with another word, but does not explain what that word is used for. ie. printer = impressoraUsually a dictionary will give a brief definition of the word you are looking up."
2,Not very useful dictionary,This dictionary does not include a lot of very necessary terms. I wound up having to do a lot of my own translating by writing a descriptive phrase when I could not find a term to use.
4,pocket sized and helpful,If you don't want to rely on your smart phone or get stuck whipping out the full over-sized maps in your bag... this is a handy discreet pocket version with some quick tips and guides in it. Its not meant to be the holy grail of knowledge. Its a great pocket guide to help you get around in Hong Kong.
4,Entertaining and useful,"I purchased this book so I could speak canto better. My friend is canto and he wasn't that willing to teach me too much. As I spend much time with him and his family I thought I could gain some utility doing some extra-circular learning of Cantonese.(and to make sure they didn't say anything bad behind my back, just joking hahah) The book was decent to say the least. It turns out my friend is a slightly different dialect then the one used in this book. Though most of the phrases I say coming from this book are understandable (once he decodes my awful pronunciation) I would recommend it, it's small enough to fit in my backpack and the text size is still easy to read. It offers just more then phrases, it even tells about certain customs and some back ground on some phrases, so you get some culture along side the phrases. I think it was a good buy."
4,Great collections from a superb artist,"This is a must for Steve Harley fans. All the basic hits, good sound and great price. After buying this cd, you will apreciate how good Cockney Rebel was, aside from being catalogued as ""glam rockers"" at that time, the lyrics are something else. David Paton is still a great musician, Stevie puts his soul on every word. Buy it"
1,another Re-release of the Fusion Turkey,"This same turkey keeps showing up again and again, every three months, the same mediocre Jazz Fusion performance, each time with a different title. I found no less than three versions of this same performance at a record store!The same as ""Live in Europe"" Vol 2, ""Stan Getz is Jazz, Live by the ..."". The record companies are thinking, I suppose, that the public will re-buy anything that says ""Stan Getz"" without checking the tunes & dates.From Stan's worst period.Caveat Emptor."
2,Disappointed!,"Unfortunately, this jacket had a slit in the back. Because I am handicap, I was unable to take it to the post office to be returned. I think I'll stick with movies, cd's and books from Amazon. Won't buy clothing again."
4,Informative and well written,"I am Jewish. Like the author, I read ""The Nun's Story"" with curiousity, but unlike the author, I had not the slightest desire to be a nun.Hansen does a good job of describing without exactly explaining why she became a nun and why she left. Her growth as a college student, the pathos of her missing her own mother's dying, and the beauty of the world when she rejoined it all touched me.I would have liked to know a bit more about her marriage(s) and motherhood, her relationships with her family members. But I guess you can't have everything in one book.I thought the ending a bit too mystical as Larsen tries to explain her current spirituality. She seems to feel guilty about being less religious, even though I think she still has faith. I guess I would like to have been told more clearly her current state of religion.But overall, I enjoyed this memoire. The writing had an irony to it that kept from being sacharine."
2,Not all I hoped,"While this book is written beautifully, there is unfortunately no new ground covered, no revelations, nothing special about it. I read it in a night and found myself thinking - yeah, so? Light reading at best."
3,Is there such a thing as too sturdy?,"The did the job, but they're SO thick & bulky. There's no way to hide them."
5,Taiwan's pride!,"ChthoniC is a band that's not afraid of speaking out for their own country, Taiwan. A band with true Taiwanese spirits and metal hearts.Seediqbale (pronounced Seediq Ba-Le) is a concept album with a sorrowful yet epic story of the Seediq tribe in Taiwan. Through its unique musical arrangements, flowing with the story's beginning, climax, and epic end, the audience were given the ""movie like"" experience.One of the many unique characters about ChthoniC is the use of ancient oriental instrument, the Erhu (two-string violin). With erhu's low key sounding, ChthoniC's music delivers the melancholic feeling that no other band does.The production and recordings were handled by Denmark's well thought after producer, Jan Borsing. Sound quality warranted.Seediqbale also features more skillful guitars, bass, keyboards, and drum; making this album a black metal must-have for the year 2007.If you don't have this album, then do yourself a favor, pick it up today."
2,remasterer blew it,"In the original album, the songs flow seamlessly into each other. In this version you can actually hear when one track ends,a silent gap,then the next song begins. Very disappointed."
2,ReMastering looses,"Not as good a sound as my original -first release copy. Just like most remasters, there has been someting lost in the process. My fault really, what made me think that someone today would do a better job than the original mastering staff? Well they didnt."
2,"The sound quality is not good at all. Very muffled sounding. Maybe a bootleg CD? Not sure, but not good.","Sound quality is very bad. Sounds very muffled. Maybe it's a bootleg CD? Not sure, but not a good Cd. :(. Very disapointed"
3,Beware of the packaging,"Love this set but 4 out of the 6 discs were totally dislodged and scratched. Amazon promptly, as always with their excellent customer service sent out a replacement- waiting to see how the discs are in this set."
3,Pink Floyd Immersion Box Set,"Fair. People apparently don't know what good sound, sounds like. Too much misc. ""collector"" BS in the package too. I'd sure like to return it!"
4,Small Monkees retrospective,"THE MONKEES * GREATEST HITS is a modest collection that's missing more than a few legitimate hits from this 60s TV show band. The 11 songs presented though are solid, and as budget packages go, this one's pretty good. Ideal for fans of 60s Top 40 music."
3,bigger and better compilations are available,"This is a good CD, but it only has eleven songs. All of the songs are good ones, but about half of them (""Monkees Theme,"" ""She,"" ""Listen To The Band,"" ""I Wanna Be Free,"" and ""Shades Of Gray"") were not actually ""hits,"" and several of the group's songs that were hits (""The Girl I Knew Somewhere,"" ""Words,"" ""Valleri,"" ""Tapioca Tundra,"" ""D.W. Washburn,"" and ""That Was Then, This Is Now"") are missing. Also, ""(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone,"" ""Pleasant Valley Sunday,"" and ""Listen To The Band"" are the album versions, not the single versions; this doesn't bother me, but some other fans may be put off by it. If you want a ""comprehensive"" collection, especially one that has all the hits (and maybe the last three abovementioned songs in their single versions), you should skip this CD; there are bigger and better compilations available."
3,For Fans Only,This CD has the very best of Randy Edleman's compositions. They are songs that Randy sings alone on a piano. While Randy Edleman fans will find it wonderful as an adjunct to the fully produced record I recommend people buy the fully produced versions on other CDs first.
1,Buyer Beware!,"After trying out this polarizer today I absolutely could not believe what I was experiencing at long telephoto lengths. The pictures were extremely fuzzy! At first I thought I needed to get my $1400 Canon ""L"" lens repaired, but then it became apparant that the source of my problem was the Sunpak filter. This filter has gone straight to my garbage can. I thought that Sunpak was a reputable company (for flashes anyway) but I've learned the hard way that cheap filters are far more damaging than handy."
4,Sunpack CF-7063-CP 77mm CPL China,"The filter I received is the same Brand Sunpack that the Camera Stores in my area carry and want $60.00 for the same Filter. I put the polarizer on Lens and focused and turned the filter worked fairly well focus was Sharp color saturation Good. I have hoya and other multi coated CL filters this one works well for $13.99. The ring could be smoother but remember this is a Chinese Filter not Japan, or Philippines, which Cost more than $13.99. I have read people with Focus issues I did not experience this problem. The Filter is a Good Value for the price and Performance.If you have a $1,500 Lens why are you looking to buying a $13.99 Filter"
1,Poorly Built,"Bought this filter for a very small price, with very low expectations. Even in such a case this filter fails to meet expectations. The build quality is abysmal, while I was attaching the filter to my lens the glass just fell off! I put the filter back together, but after a little use it falls right off again.For the effectiveness: it will give you a bad flare if you have a light source in the frame or right out of its border. The polarizing effect is not that bad (given that you have low expectation to start with).IMHO, it is not worth the price paid, however small; you are better off using a UV filter for protection and post processing for the sky color etc.."
2,Would not buy again,"I was generally pleased with this GPS system--my first--when it worked. I liked the big screen and it was pretty user-friendly. Occasionally it would lose signal in a weird spot, but it wasn't a big problem. About 2 weeks after we bought the thing it died--would not turn on at all. So we took it back and they gave us another one. It worked fine for about 3 months, then when I tried to turn it on today it was dead as a doornail once again. My husband is a systems analyst and electronics whiz, so I'm pretty sure it's nothing we're doing wrong. Back to the store it goes tomorrow, and we're getting a Garmin or Magellan. This was my first and last experience with Harman Kardon."
2,Works...but!,"The unit does a good job of giving directions. Although the software is rather in-flexible. It always picks the shortest route, not necessarily the easiest route. The unit has locked up on me a number of times, requiring it to be reset. I suspect it has something to do with heat. As it has happened after returning to the car after it has set outside for an hour or so. Tech support was prompt in their response, but no help. At this time there is no way to register the product on Harmon Kardon's web sight."
2,Buyer beware,"I have returned 2 now...the first one just quite working and the second one couldn't receive a signal. The first one was not an out of the box failure, but the second was. The maps are at least 2 years out of date. You will definately double, triple or even quadruple your U-Turns with this device."
2,It's a mixed bag,"I bought the H/K 300 for its price and its big screen. It's easy to read w/o putting on my reading glasses while driving. Sound quality is fine for my old ears. But....and this is a big one for me: it won't hold a charge for more than a day! And that's w/o turning it on at all. Moreover, I can't update maps, and there is a lot of building going on in my area. Would I buy one of these again. NO!"
2,GUI is nice,This system only looks good and was okay for about a year then the screen started to flicker and it wouldn't find a connection for a long time....hope harman kardon learn from these experiences
2,Stick with the Garmin or Magellan,"This thing got me lost so many times, I was much better off without it. It often chose ridiculously out-of-the-way routes, and also tended to send me on wild goose chases for restaurants that didn't exist. The maps are frequently incomplete and/or incorrect, and since it can't be updated it won't be long before it's totally useless.There's something to be said for name brands. Stick with the Garmin or Magellan, they've been in this business for a long time and they know what they're doing."
5,Great GPS,The setup is easy. You don't have to do anything.In lock position it follows you everywhere.Nice and bright touch screeen. you can even scroll the map by sliding your finger over it.I highly recomend it.
3,not exactly flimsy,"This fork is acceptable -- not worth the hassle of returning four of them -- but I had expected something a little heavier from the description. Also, while the pattern is nice, the forks themselves are rather...flat."
4,It's About Time!!!!,"I have been a fan of Jeff Lorber for many years. He has done so much throughout his career to shape the sound of contemporary jazz yet he is virtually unknown to most. It's about time this CD came out!!! It's expensive, but does feature some great tracks by Jeff. The title track and Delevans are my personal favorites. Buy it if you can afford it!"
4,where are you boys?,"I love this cd..have done since 1999..I play it too often, still!Its one of those melodic movements in your life that feels good going back to.Chilled, sexy, sassy..comforting.Where are you boys? would love to hear new AoS tracks, and or a new compilation!enchant me!"
2,Very basic charts,"I was disappointed by these charts. They are not very complex, and there is very little of the traditional knotwork patterns, which is what I was hoping for. The charts are easy to read, and it would be a good book for a beginner/intermediate stitcher."
2,Authentic Celtic this book is not,"I was very disappointed with this book. The use of pastel colours has no precedence in Celtic art. Also, the fact that nothing in the book, none of the knot work, is symetrical! Obviously the designer had not looked at any Celtic art before he did this book."
5,A really useful craft book...,I like to do lots of different crafts and this volume is intended for cross-stitch but it is great for crocheting and any other craft that can use a grid as a pattern. I have used this one thus far for the alphabets to make squares for an afghan I am making for a friend as well as some of the knotted images for squares in the same afghan. I do intend to do some cross-stitch using some of the patterns at a later date and this one has lots of variations.
3,"Not for beginners, Not necessarily what I was expecting","Two, and only two complaints here:1) These patterns are not for beginners. They are full to the brim of half-stitches, which are quite difficult to execute on standard Aida fabric.2) I got this book hoping for knot designs, and it contains almost none. There were, in fact, only a small handfull of designs that fit my pre-conception of ""celtic design.""Aside from that, it's a great book. The illustrations are done very nicely, the charts are full color, and all the little details about materials and counts and everything are in place.Still... I liked the Reader's Digest published ""Celtic Cross Stitch : 30 Alphabet, Animal, and Knotwork Projects"" much, much better."
2,changed my mind,about this book; the patterns are wonderful but need some adaptation for more traditional colors; the patterns do not give credit to the powerful role of Celtic women but some figures are easily adapted to do so......
3,Very useful!,This purchase was definetely worth it! This has been an excellent resource guide for me! It came to me in excellent condition and shipping went quick!
5,Wow....,"I love this cd. These guys rock my face off. I wasn't too high on them...but I decided to just listen to the cd, and it just sucked me in. Buy this, it's great!"
4,Pretty good,"This is a great CD for your collection, especially considering the price. But I would have to recommend the Zinman/Upshaw performance of the same piece if you want/need superior quality. Still, not too shabby."
1,weird dolls,This doll is so creppy i'm terrifyed please exit this doll off the computer. I have a doll of my own it even creeps me out. Thank you for your time. Sorry this doll is gay
5,Great Album - Brought back great memories,I remember listening to this in the 80's - I listened to it over and over again. Dionne's voice was great and the song choices made you sing along. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes Dionne Warwick. So glad it is finally out on CD.
5,Your Dance Can Save Us All!,"Video games for awhile now had lost their luster to me. How many side scrolling, or fighting games can one person play before wanting to pull out their eyes in hopes of that proving more fun then the games they were playing. Well, Konami changed that by making Dance Dance Revolution for the home systems. The game itself is brilliant and fun, but the music is what makes it outstanding. This 2 CD set provides one great CD of all the songs available on the game itself and provides a second CD of a non-stop dance mix of all the songs. Buy the soundtrack! Import the game! Dance until you cry!"
3,Song list would be helpful,"I am looking for the Terra song ""Doll"" on one of these mixes and I would really appreciate these albums to have the song lists...some of them have it but like this one, there is nothing....please, someone, put up a list of songs!!!Thanks"
3,Marginal Album,"Jermaine was a huge success on his solo outing, Not. In fact the only true gem on this album is the single, ""If you say my eyes are beautiful"" duet with Whitney Houston is fantastic. Probably should be a wedding favorite."
3,Very Cool Photography...but S*L*O*W moving!,"I purchased this DVD to use with my Living Environ. High School students.I had to use the DVD's menu, in order to skip around to the more relevent items (geared toward Biology topics). After viewing the 4-5 items, I had to end the DVD; since things were becoming rather too much of the same.The novelty of viewing things at 100,000X (times normal sight) had definitely worn thin by this time...it was becoming rather tedious!"
1,What's good about this book is this....,"It's a whole heck of a lot better than the Godfather III script!Unfortunately, that is all the good that I can say about this book. I admit to not being anxious to read this book since I figured it would be so far inferior to the original, but the author turned the story line in a way that exceeded my low expectations. That said, I still have to say it was better than the last Godfather movie. In that film, I was rooting for someone to kill off the godfather's daughter. As I recall, the killer was someone hired by the Actors Guild.There is nothing more to say about this book. It's only too bad that the Puzo family didn't respect their predecessor's advice and left the book alone. The original still sells, so they are making enough in royalties. Like the third movie sequel, just pretend that it never happened and enjoy the original."
2,Just pulp fiction...,"Mildly entertaining... Attempts to tie up loose ends from the Godfather series -- doesn't often succeed. A few interesting episodes. There's hundreds of trash novels making bestseller lists out there -- Return of the Godfather is merely another one to read then throw away. While pretentious reviewers may excoriate the novel, they've forgotten what it is -- just pulp fiction intended only to kill a few hours trapped on a bus or an airplane. To that end, it succeeds."
3,Tweener,"As a fan of the Godfather saga movies,I found the story between the excellent Godfathers I,II and the disappointing Godfather III.The story is a good read and kind of bridges the stories.Do not expect Puzo but if you are a ""Godfather"" fan,I would suggest this book."
5,Wow--so many confused readers!!!,"First off, this novel is well written, which may stick in the craw of your average Puzo reader... Secondly, this is a novel--not a movie. If you are comparing the movie versions to the novel, then you really don't understand how things work in hollywood. I am always stunned by people who mix genre in reviews--are you totally deranged? How do you compare literature to the spit out drivel of the movie versions? Ultimately, this may be too much within a literary vein for most fans of Puzo--Mr. Winegardner's only mistake was to write at a higher level than most people can understand. This is a great filler for those lost years in Puzo's novels, and sets us up (hopefully) for some more great returns in future novels. Don't believe the grade school reviews out there--this is a fine novel that may have been poorly marketed by the press."
3,Ultimately unsatisfying...,"The signature of the Godfather books and films is the orgy of violence that sets things right. Winegardner disregards this and gives a halfhearted attempt at closure-- there's no resolution to the character he's given us the most focus on. The result is that although he manages to flesh out some of the secondary characters Puzo left undiscovered, there's no real ending. In addition, the over-reliance on renamed, fictionalized versions of actual people (based on Puzo's Johnny Fontane) is distracting.In the end, I'm not sure Winegardner ever knew what he wanted this book to be, and the result is a book destined for the markdown rack."
3,Long and Just Okay,"Winegardner can write. But he's no Puzo -- at least when it comes to telling the Corleone saga. The plot is intricate, but too clever and complicated, making it unbelievable and, at times, impenetrable. I enjoyed his digressions with backstory on Fredo Corleone and Tom Hagen. This may make the book worth reading (not really). It's even pretty cool how Winegardner wove the movie depictions of the characters into this book. But, then, I guess it was the thrill of Puzo's work that I was remembering and enjoying again, not Winegardner's new twists on old storylines. I should add that Winegardner got the Mafia dialouge down pat. Or at least I think he did based on what I learned from the Godfather book and movies. My advice: don't pay full price for the hard back -- it's a rip-off."
1,A book to pass on,"Having read all of Puzo's works, I was eager to read the Godfather Returns. I was not expecting it to be a replica of Puzo's writings, as the authors have different styles and are writing years apart. But some things are better left alone. Winegardner does the story no justice. His writing is extremely poor and jumps around to much. It is as if he has no understanding of the original. This is probably the worst book I ever read. I did finish it but it was a very painful read. You are better off skipping it."
2,Boring,made the mistake of trying to read this book while GODFATHER II was playing on TV. Had actually started reading the book the day before but thought I'd catch up on my reading during the commercials (movie was on TNT). The original story was great - this book sucked. Dropped it off at the library after 65 pages. What a disappointment.
2,Creative Writing????,"DisappointingTo much exposition. Not interesting enough.The 'surprise' about Fredo is too easy.It's no secret that Fontane was based on Frank Sinatra in the original, but to completely copy Sinatra's experience with the Kennedys, the mob, and the media lacks creativity.Hagen's story deserved more attention; he and Michael's bid for legitimacy lacks any real depth.The rival bosses aren't dealt with respectfully, they seem like caricatures.Nick Geraci is an excellent character. He and his father need their own book/story independent of the Corleones.Francesca Corleone???????"
1,Put yourself to sleep,"Having read all of Puzo's books I couldn't resist purchasing this book. The purchase was a mistake, the book adisappointment in the extreme.The recognizable characters from ""The Godfather"" were distorted shadows of the characters created by Puzo, the new characters shallow and uninteresting.The book does not contain a single plot that will excite you and if all of the ""psycho-babble"" regarding the motivation of variousperipheral characters was removed the book size would be reduced by half. (and slightly improved! )Don't waste your money on this one.If you have already purchased it, you might find it useful in falling to sleep."
2,A story would help,I stuck with Godfather Returns because I love the characters but it would have been a whole lot better with a story. The icky porn scene every 20 pages or so was ineffective compensation. It ended as if the author just ran out of ink or paper. What a missed opportunity.
2,Pointless,"* Numerous times, we hear about the preparation to some activity, then cut to months later, and it's already happened.* Certain subtle actions are, for no good reason, not explained to the reader, who really has to know who's doing what and why.* Poorly edited -- more than once, I was like, ""What?"" and read a paragraph aloud to try and figure out what it meant, but was still stymied.* I kept waiting for something interesting to happen. Numerous times I found myself skimming, trying to get to something interesting.* Gave up halfway through.All in all, pointless. Winegardner gives it a good try, but he doesn't have the feel for the mob or the people that Puzo had. I don't believe it's purely the publisher trying to reanimate a dead corpse, but it's pretty close."
3,Keeping up with the Corleones...,"Anyone fascinated by the GODFATHER franchise will find amusement with this book. Without giving anything away, there is a lot of background created on all the characters(dead or alive) originally from Puzo's book through Coppola's second movie. Whether you agree with the author's interpretations or not, will either enhance or deflate your enjoyment. A lot of emphasis is given to the impressions that the characters leave on each other. Some are farfetched, but after all Mr. Winegardner has a tough act to follow. Look for all the parodies, that are elaborated on greatly from corrupt prominent politicians to alleged celebrity mob involvement of the era. There are some new characters and a few surprises provided. The author for the most part writes in great detail and rehashs constantly from the past. Sometimes tedious, sometimes brilliant, just stick to it!"
1,This book doesn't seem true to the original,"Don't like it. Don't like it at all. I've tried to finish it a couple of times, but I can't. I just don't like it. This is not (in my opinion) true to the characters Mario Puzo developed. Puzo developed strong charctacters (Vito, Mike, Sonny - even Fredo). These characters had strengths, weaknesses, morals (in their own twisted ways) - and had their own emotional baggage - who doesn't. This baggage made them more real; more interesting. Winegardner took these characters and redeveloped them so that the weaknesses controlled the characters - as opposed to the characters struggling to control their weaknesses. This book and the subsequent one take these characters and de-evolve them into wrecked shells of what they were. This de-evolution happens so quickly, I can't follow it and it just doesn't work for me."
3,"Readable and OK, but no more","Mark Weingartner continues the story of the Corleones from the early 1950's to the later 1960's and partly succeeds. How? By writing a story that is interesting enough to keep the pages turning. We see how Tessio is disposed of for betraying Michael, we follow the Corleones to Nevada, and the story expands to Cleveland, Chicago, even Cuba. The author keep us updated on Michael, Fredo, and Johnny Fontaine during the 1950's and 1960's, plus many new mob figures that enter the narrative. But Weingartner never reaches the superb pacing of The Godfather, and few desire to reread this second edition - unlike with Puzo's original. An OK sequel for Godfather buffs, but no more."
3,"Good, but not as good as the original","I enjoyed reading a book with the same characters, although I have to say that it did not hold my attention like the first one. Still a good read!!"
2,so much potential wasted,"I'm a huge fan of The Godfather series. This book did nothing to move the story along. It was nice to see a writer try to advance the characters along, but it was very shallow. The writer decided to just re-hash 1960s history and the spectre of mob involvment as a Corleone driven history. Also, Michael is not as main a character as he should be."
4,Great Reading,I just finished reading this book myself and was delighted at most of how it was abridged by chapter and book form. I have also read the original Godfather book by Mario Puzo and seen all three movies. Highly recommend this.
4,Not bad . . . not bad at all,"Despite the cheesy B movie-type title, The Godfather Returns is a very readable and thoroughly entertaining work. Mario Puzo himself would've been proud of this book. The book narrates the missing years of the Corleone family, the years that were not tackled in the original Puzo masterpiece and the cinematic sequels. In this book, Winegardner does a masterful job of smoothly interfacing the plot lines in the original book and the movies that came after. I don't think this is as easy as people think, considering the fact that The Godfather II had several flashback portions. Even the narrative style is faithful to the original work by Puzo.Don't be put off by the title. For Godfather fans everywhere, this is a must read, although the book is not recommended for those who haven't read or watched the previous Godfather offerings."
1,My dog can write better than this guy,"In anticipation of this book, I went back and read my Mario Puzzo books and purchased all of the other Puzzo books I had not read before. I was ready for The Godfather Returns. I realize that this is not a Puzzo novel, but at the very least Winegardener should have tried to follow the original flow of the characters. What a disappointment, this book is boring, the stories all over the place, hard to follow, have to read pages over and over trying to understand what he is trying to say, it is just a total mess. If this assignment was given to a 6th grade kid, he would have done better. I can only hope that Hollywood does not decide to turn this into a movie, it would be a bomb. I am surprised that the Puzzo family allowed this book to be published; they should have thrown away the manuscript and commissioned a different writer. Too bad the minimum rating I can give is one star, if I could I would give it no stars."
2,Mr. Winegardner You're No Mario Puzo,"While I admire the initiative to undertake a sequel to a classic that will probably never be equaled, the author, in my opinion, develops only one new character of any interest--Francesca and fails to build a complete story. I have read every Puzo novel from the Fortunate Pilgrim to the Sicilian and La Familia. Puzo never failed to build characters you can almost touch and stories that keep you up way beyond your bedtime. Winegardner failed to do either. He appeared to be building a cast of characters to carry on the legacy, but failed to deliver a story that made you want to turn the page. The only reason I stayed with it until the end, was to try to find a redeeming quality. Unfortunately, there is none."
2,Major disappointment,"Mario Puzo's literary estate made a poor choice. This novel is not a worthy successor to ""The Godfather."" Puzo's original novel was action-packed from start to finish. It moved like (you should pardon the expression) a shot. In this book, nothing happens. I mean nothing. It's a bunch of mobsters sitting around talking about their feelings. Winegardner has taken what was arguably the greatest gangster story ever written, and turned it into chick lit."
1,The Godfather regurgitates,"This turkey could make a statue gag. I honestly wanted to be able to say something positive about this book in light of all the negative stuff everyone else is saying, but I can't. God, this thing is awful! I would never have believed that such a rich tapestry of literary potential as the ""Godfather"" saga represented could be treated so shabbily. ""Once put down, this book can't be picked up again!"" And to think so many better novels couldn't get published for one reason or another! I did not listen to the other reviewers, so I went out and WASTED $8 on the paperback of ""The Godfather Returns,"" and all I can say is I wish I could return ""The Godfather Returns"" and get my money returned! A word to the (un)wise should be sufficient."
1,An offer you can refuse,"I, like many others, was intrigued by the possibility of picking up the Godfather saga and carrying it into new possibilities and new characters. This book does neither!I read quite a lot, and I very rarely give up on a book. But this one is just an overblown, poorly written, colossal bore. I got about half way through it and decided that I could think of much better ways to waste my time. The characters are hard to follow and keep straight, and even if you do manage that you really don't care about any of them anyway. The pacing ishorrifically slow, and in the first half of the book nothing much happens. Save your money and your time. There are much much better books out there."
1,Unreadable,"Probably the worst book I have ever (almost) read. Could only get throughthe first hundred pages, had to put it down"
2,NOT WHAT I WANTED,"I will keep this short. I really wanted this book to blow me away, I kept on giving it a chance. There was only one part of the book that was a real page turner, but it didn't last long. There was no anticipation of what was going to happen next, we already know Castro is still in power... The whole JFK, RFK, Sinatra thing I know about already. I wanted to get more into the life of Michael Corleone. You missed the boat. I just pray this dosen't get made into a movie it would make Part III look like a classic."
2,don't like this one,"I loved The Godfather, and looked forward to reading this one. I soon discovered that this author comes no where near the classic. The writing is just not as good, and it didn't seem to follow the story as I know it. Also, it was a bit anacronistic -it is supposed to be set in 1955, but one of the characters mentions Viagra!! I think that was when I stopped reading. So, I'm going to stick to the original."
3,Generous condition rating,"The only issue was that the book's condition was a but of a stretch considering it had dirty water spots on it and some type of sticky granules between a few of the pages. By carefully opening the pages over a trahscan and wiping things off, I was able to get to everything without any rips etc, but you can still see the spot residue."
1,"Those Who Can't Write Teach, can't teach? Write.","The book is so bad as to be good ... almost imitable: ""he ran his fingers through the thinning bowel spasms of the twins: Gorgonzola & Mozzarella. Fredo, however, was fond of salami, though he hated himself in a Freudian way while winking at Tom who killed the cat who ate the cheese that lived in the house that Vito built.""If you think this is simply a joke read the bloody book. A cult classic in the making. The film should be a hoot!"
3,The Godfather Opus,"Adequate, but I never finished it. It is better to leave this subject alone; no writer will equal the first Godfather series."
3,A Bit Disconnected..,"This is probably an offer you CAN refuse. The author has undertaken an unenviable task in writing a book that is a sequel to one of the most interesting novels in the last 30 years. First the good: 1) the characters are back. However, it is just not the same without Don Vito Corleone. 2) We find out the fate of the family buffoon, Fredo 3) We get a whole section on Michael's WWII experience. Now, the bad: 1) The author lacks Puzo's ability to give us the ""feel"" of the Mafia experience. 2) Each chapter seems like a book of short Mafia short stories.All-in-all, not a terrible book; it just pales in comparison to its predecessor."
2,Never goes anywhere !!!,"Two MAJOR problems:1) Too many small plotsIt's great that the author tried to stay true to the original, but in doing so, he creates a web of new plots, new sub-plots, sub-sub-plots and sub-sub-sub-plots that never allow the overall narrative to go anywhere.2) Too much insight into insignificant characters.It also gets very aggravating because he has to get inside the head of every single character and describe motivations.THAT is a fatal flaw in these types of stories: they are always about what the characters DON'T say and whether they are who they say they are...or simply a foil for someone else.**************************************************************Maybe it would have been better if it was just a collection of short stories.There were some good ideas, but in designing a brilliant jet engine...the author forgot to include the wings."
4,Avid Book Reader,Book was okay but definitely better than Godfather III. Infact this could have been Part III and then the trilogy would really have been completed.
3,"Interesting at times, but average overall","Taking over someone's work is tough to do. Imagine someone else writing an addition/filler to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, etc. It just can't be done without people criticizing every minute detail.I thought MW did a good job of following Puzo's style and I felt he maintained continuity between the book and movies. Overall, it was an easy read and the character development was enjoyable, albeit a little bit too much at times for certain characters. I also liked some of the surprises - it helped fill in the blanks about several characters.My main complaint was that there was no mention of my favorite side character - Frank Pantangelli. I would have loved to see him have a prominent part in the book as opposed to Nick Geraci. The explanation of Clemenza dying was rather weak in my opinion too.If you're a big Godfather fan, I would recommend this book, but only buy this book if you've already read Puzo's Godfather and if you have seen Godfather I and II."
2,A little disappointing,"Was not too impressed, it didn't keep my interest, started to pickup by chapter 5."
3,OK - Not Great,"An Ok book but not close to the gteat writings of Puzo - very slow at many times throughout the book. Several times I was tempted to put it aside and move on to something else, but was in hopes it would ""pick-up"" - sad imitation. Wait for the paperback or purchase at a reduced price."
3,Just a Comment,"I think readers need to understand that this book is a continuation of the Mario Puzo novel, not necessarily the Coppolla films. In the Godfather novel there is no Frank Pentangilli. Cuneo and Stracci are not killed. Etc. Etc. If you treat this new novel as a continuation of the Puzo novel it will make more sense."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE BOOK","That's $8.50 I'll never see again!After 100 painful pages I dropped this abortion of a book like it was on fire, which, by the way, would have helped the book very much.I picked it up because I thoroughly enjoy Puzo and the Godfather (original one) was an elegantly simple story. No, I wasn't expecting Winegardner to have the same style of prose as Puzo and in this I wasn't dissapointed. Mario must be turning over in his grave.Whereas Puzo's words just flow Winegardner's come in at a painful rate. The characters are obscure and impossible to get a feel for. They have more names and nicknames than The Lord of the Rings (another vastly overrated book).I advise my fellow readers not to buy this absolutely horrible book. However, if you must then give me a call. I have one I'm dying to get rid of."
3,2/3 thru....,That is how long it took for the plot to gel. Alot was not consistent with the previous/book movie. But it was fun reading about the family again. A good beach read.
1,I was not impressed.,I picked this up because I loved Puzo's work and wanted to see how another author would handle the characters he was given. He failed. He failed in a big way. There are some characters that are iconic in the literary world and this book seems as if it was an attempt at revisionist history. It just flopped for me. I would like to think it isn't my love of Puzo's work that caused me to feel this way but I just found myself trudging through the book in hopes of it getting better. It didn't.
4,Not quite what the book title implies,Nicely done book decent art & photos. The book implies a lot more then is given in the research. Could and should have been better done work.
4,ok,"Good game for the boys. They loved the remote control and the actual building of the frame. Would recommend to those who like building tools for kids. Snapping parts is a little difficult at first, but works like a charm soon after."
2,chateau knife by oneida,The knives did not match the set I have. They are alot thinner and not as heavy. Maybe they changed their weight. Delivery was quick
3,good but not great,"I agree with the other reviewer here, given the list of great musicians performing on this album and the time when it was released (1966), I was expecting a better effort. It's a good album but not a great one, and being a big fan of Lee Morgan I was a bit disappointed overall."
2,Musty,Good book but this copy was so musty/moody smelling it set of my allergies!!!!It was not in very good condition.
3,Rainforest Remedies Book,Somewhat disappointed with this book. Does not contain much new information that other herbal and natural health books have. Good for the novice herbalist.
5,Better than My CPU,I still run the AMD K8 CPU and I changed to this card from a GeForce 6800 with no gaming improvement. 3200 memory and 2.5 GHZ CPU are choaking this card off. Guess it's time to get a dual core. Great card! Good specs for $140!
4,great card,"For the price, this card is definitely worth it. It glitches occasionally, but usually runs just fine."
5,"What a ""Splash""!","Started using this product in high school...too many years ago:( Loved it then, but it became unavailable in my area and I moved on to other less satisfying products. Now, thanks to Amazon, I have it again. It is great as a ""sprunch"" spray...yes, I am a child of the 80's. Gives a very firm hold to styles. It also provides a great separated or piecey look. One thing to watch is build-up. It can be hard to wash out. It is easier now than it was, maybe shampoos are better now. I also use a clarifier by Suave 2 or 3 times a week to take care of it. I am currently using it on a short style, but I have also used it on very long hair. I have naturally curly hair and it stands up well to humidity and frizzies. I hope you like it as much as I do!"
5,excellent inexpensive slide reviewer,This is an excellent slide reviewer for the money invested. I bought it to review some family slides from as long as 65 years ago and it does a great job.I do recommend buying the transformer to preclude constantly having to replace batteries.
4,Gets the Job Done,"This is an inexpensive way to magnify slides (but it doesn't project them). There's a bit of glare on the front lens, but viewing is OK. It beats holding the tiny images up over your head to use a ceiling light! The product arrived quicker than the estimated shipping time, so overall, I was happy with it."
5,Pana-Vue #2 - Slide Viewer,Really fast shipping on product. Allows me to review slides and provides a clear picture....really great! Just what I wanted!
5,Just what I was looking for,This slide viewer works great and is just what I was looking for. The viewer ws inexpensive and works great. I would recommend this if you have a bunch of old slides and want to choose the ones you want printed.
4,Slide viewer,Good portable viewer for editing slides. I use a light table for gross editing followed by this slide viewer to decide what is interesting enough to scan for future treatment. Saves a lot of scanning time.
1,pana-vue #2 slide viewer,The pana-vue #2 slide viewer is not worth getting. It is hard to put in the batteries and the product is not made very well. We sent it back for a refund.
1,Way too small!,This hardly enlarges the picture at all. You might as well hold the slide up to the light and see it that way. To me this was a waste of money and overpriced for what it is.
4,Basic slide viewer,"This certainly works in the sense that you put a slide in and it lights up and you see the slide, but the light is not all that bright. Considering that it is cheap and basic, however, no complaints."
1,Slides NOT Negatives,"I bought this reader for the thousands of negatives I have and need to go through. It doesn't work for negatives at all. The light is bright, but it fails for what I needed it for."
2,Okay,"I imagine this does the job.However, putting slides into position and holding them with light on to preview them, my finger was sore holding it in place.No true magnification either."
4,SLIDE VIEWER,THIS IS AN INEXPENSIVE VIEWER THAT WORKS GREAT FOR A SLIDE AT A TIME. I BOUGHT 2 TO GIVE TO MY KIDS SO THEY CAN LOOK AT SOME OLD SLIDES I AM ALSO GIVING THEM. IT WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.BTW I use an old Pana-Vue product to review my many old slides. It still works great after 30 plus years
1,Not Worth It,No features such as a stand for easiy desk top viewing. Battery compartment falls apart when replacing batteries.
3,Functionality,I wish the viewer had more magnification. The very small images on the slides were still small through the viewer.
4,Adequate for Price,"The viewer was fine for my intent of reviewing old slides to have prints made. Obviously, the view area is modest but for the price it was suitable."
5,Economical and Works Well,I am pleased with this slide viewer. It allows me to look at the slides with a large enough screen so that I can sort my slides out. It is high quality with a low price!
2,Overpriced shabbily manufactured item,"This item DOES fulfill its function of helping viewer view slides easily. However, it is shabbily put together and I had to change the angle of one of its parts to get it to work. That will probably will bear constant attention a long as it lasts.(I refer to a weak metal holder in the battery compartment.} It is hoped that products will improve over years of use by the general public, but this item has never improved and is over priced for its manufacture and successful lasting function"
4,Finding equipment to review old collections,Having found a large amount of old slides from a deceased relative I had difficulty in locating a viewer in any retail outlet. Found a good selection on Amazon
2,So-so,This is not the best way to view slides. The picture comes and goes and it is never consistent.
2,defective pana-vue,"This part did not work when I got it. I got it to work, although intermittently, by putting tape around the batteries to fit more snugly in the unit. It must not have been tested before it was shipped"
3,Simple Viewer,"I rated the Pana-Vue #2 slide viewer as a three star because there's not much to it. It's just a plastic container that illuminates the slide. There's minimal magnification and I think it is overpriced for what it is. However, I needed something to be able to see the hundreds of slides I am scanning and that is basically what it allows me to do."
1,Very poor quality,"I bought this for my Mother who has macular degeneration. It arrived and wouldn't work, the bulb fell out, wouldn't snap onto the plastic brackets. Needless to say I'll be returning this. Looks like others had good luck with this item, but mine was a piece of junk."
3,Panavue 2 Illuminated Slide Viewer,"The product is good however if you have 500+ slides like I do, it is simply not practical. Takes way to long for so many slides!"
2,Panavue slide viewer is very good for viewing a few slides.,"The viewer was very good for viewing just a few slides, but 20 or more slides a slide projector that is automatic and/or to project the slides to a large size is better."
1,Misleading Illustration,The illustration used for this viewer is deceptive. There is no magnifying lens in this viewer so the view you get is the actual slide size and includes the cardboard mount as well. For a few dollars more a much better unit is available from the same manufacturer.
5,Heartwarming!,I have fully enjoyed all the All Creatures Great and Small series and Series 7 is no exception. It always has some funny characters to laugh at or with and some beautiful scenery as well as some heartwarming interpersonal interactions.
4,Serie 7 James Herriot,"For the die-hard James Herriot fans a must have, specially if you have the other 6 series already. It completes your collection and is as alwaysa pleasure to watch."
5,"at last, the waiting is over!","For all fans of this series, and have been collecting the previous 6 series, the last series of"" All creatures great & small"" is announced. Hope it includes the last special show."
5,"All Creatures Great and Small, series 7","A delightful conclusion to this touching series. When I first began watching Harriot's stories brought to life on the screen it was often difficult to understand because of the heavy accent of the local farmers and a number of the expressions exclusive to the Brits. However, over time, and often backing up the video to hear again what was being said, one's ear becomes accustomed to the dialogue used in the script. There is so much garbage and triviality on American television, i.e., language laced wih foul language and sex simply to titillate, that I found All Creatures to be most refreshing. The stories are 30 years old now, but this kind of entertainment never goes out of style. I treasure having this series in my film library so that I can return to these stories again and again."
4,All seasons great and small,"The James Herriot series never seems to get tired - just like the wonderful books they are based on. This, the 7th season is every bit as fresh and witty as the others with most of the usual cast. The Herriot children re-appear in this series and as usual the writing for the kids and their acting just does not work. I'm not sure why kids always seem like cardboard cut-outs. As the kids play a rather minor role it's not a serious of a short-coming - it's a great season."
3,A good simple complilation,I think this is a good album. All of the songs on this cd are on previous cds but it is a good complilation for anyone who just like to listen to certain ike and tina songs.This is all together a good album
2,What's All the Fuss About?,"Everyone says that One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most important books ever written (it was even runner up to best novel of the century in TIME Magazine), but I beg to differ. I found the author's style unpolished and uncontrolled, I found it to be too long, and I've read better attempts at mystical realism. Catch 22 is a wonderful book and pulls the style of wonderfully, while Marquez lacks in almost every respect. I do give him some merit for imagry, but overall I really can't understand why everyone thnks this book is so great."
4,it works,"it's what it is, some songs are louder than others, but that seems to be a problem with most cd+g's that i purchase, works fine for fun."
4,collector,Great model the display case added to the model being purchased as a model. The year and color were a perfect addition.
2,An interesting topic but the words got in the way...,"I was hoping to settle in for a juicy read of the goings-on regarding the ""fabulously"" wealthy but was extremely disappointed with the author's lack of both content and style. Lamely reported ancedotes such as someone getting stuck with a group bar tab, fights breaking out between bar patrons and flowers being sent out to a table for a restaurant birthday celebration do NOT an interesting tome make and that's just in the first 40 pages! Also Mr. Kessler's interviews are reported in such a ""jumpy"" manner, one is never sure who is speaking at any given time. Irritating, clipped paragraphs abound which gives the book a ""pasted together"" feel. There is a treasure trove of subject matter in Palm Springs. Hopefully, someone will write about it someday in a more readable manner."
2,LIKE READING SOMEONE'S DIARY,"Basically a series of anecdotes. Like reading someone's diary.The interesting anecdotes were that Marjorie Merriweather Post liked her gold bath room fixtures because gold is much easier to clean, that one of Bobby Kennedy's kids OD'd in room 107 of the Brazilian Court Hotel, and that the Kennedy estate was falling in and had no A/C when the family sold it. Of course, Donald Trump weighs in with his genius for self promotion. I guess one could have used it for a guide to the hot bars and restaurants in the late 90's when the book was written.But the book is sadly lacking in insights and history of how Palm Beach became such a center for superficiality and messed up values. About the only insigths he offers is that super rich are often unhappy, and their children could care less when they die.Don't bother!"
1,The upity season,"After reading the first ten pages of the book ""The Season"" you have read the book. It is repetitive, boring and monatonous.You can only read so much of peoples toys and the author uses the same people over and over. The most interesting people in the book are a gay male escort and his troubled mate.I think Mr. Kessler just wanted to drop a few names so he could get into some parties. If he wasn't Jewish I would think he would want to be on the ""A"" list of Palm Beach; but, maybe he feels he is a ""But""."
3,It was just okay....,"This book was really really inaccurate. The author name-drops about flying with Donald Trump, going to a socialite's home and seeing the list of the season's ""PEOPLE"" to be with. I mean, the book was just alright, but it wasn't anything to be impressed with, and seeing as I am from Palm Beach, there is nothing here that I didn't aready know. The book had some very boring parts, but it doesn't give an accurate account of what goes on here, and it could never be written in a book. It's too complicated to understand, and he skips around from person to person. All in all, save it for a vdery rainy day."
2,"The disappointing ""Season""","Upon picking up this book, I thought I would learn about the interesting and extravagant lives of the rich and famous of Palm Beach. Kessler gets you interested in the characters, but I could do with out the jumping chapters. What struck me most about the book is Kessler's continual coverage of the prejudice against Jews in Palm Beach society. Although mention of this subject is important, I did not appreciate it being shoved down the reader's throat. Kessler uses the book as his soapbox for this subject. If kessler wanted to write about bigotry in Palm Beach, he should have given the book a more explicit title, letting the reader know that Prejudice against Jews is this books main objective."
3,The Season of Never Ending Narcissism and Brown Nosing,"Kessler's stories are amusing, and his writing is enough to keep the reader captivated, yet I left with the sense that Kessler spent the entire time ingratiating himself far too much with the PB society to be able accurately see it. Of course, he lauds himself with his occasional lapses into actual research, uncovering a few frauds for who they are, and he always has the standby of the anti-Semitism of the island to rave about, but the rest of the book he spends babbling about the color of the dress she wore at the party that evening. This is a cross between Dateline's sensationalism combined with Cosmopolitan's content."
3,Rich People,"Decent book, especially when you compare with what else is out there these days. The facts presented in the book were very interesting, and AS ALWAYS, Ronald Kessler exposed every bit of target subject. However, I find that this book is poorly organized, I find myself wondering how the author ever got on these certain tangents. From a literary point of view, this book left a lot to be desired, but to everyone else that has an interest in how the upper crust really lives (read: 98.746% of the population)""The Season"" certainly satiates our curious (or maybe just jealous) tongue."
1,Poor fare for all but those who live in their closets,"It's hard to believe that these tired jokes and insipid sayings would be of interest to anyone except the mentally challenged. Don't waste your money. This is truly an example of ""vanity press"" wherein someone who can't write can get published."
5,Too hard to obtain,"This album is perhaps the best Dregs offering, featuring the line up from most of the Dregs albums, but with Mark O'Conner (the awesome violinist/fiddler), known throughout the Nashville and Country scene for his Studio work. Those of you who know O'Conner know he is much more than just a fiddler; he is an incredible instrumentalist. The rest of the Dregs line up give their usual amazing instrumental performances, with the normal broad variety of musical styles offered: Rock, Jazz/Fusion, Mellow, Country, Acoustic, and even two songs with vocals. Unfortunately, this disc has been ""unobtainium;"" I still have to spin my LP if I want to listen to it! But it sounds as though Amazon may be able to help me finally get the album on CD. Don't miss your chance to do the same!"
2,the corporation's dregs album,"this one is just so frustrating. you can tell someone from arista is breathing down their neck whole they are making this one.the tunes are not as great as the ones prior. if you liked ""crank it up"" you probably went to see the 90210 yes concert and/or you have a mullet and/or a moustache. that tune is absolutely absurd...""have a million notes to play""...yeah i bet you do..can you imagine how embarrasing it is to steve morse or these other guys to hear that track..they want to hide probably....go to the earlier albums..this is an example of a band and record company under-estimating the intelligence of the fans...for you kids, this album smacks (actually smells) of record exec involvement..just like the yes scholp i talked about here. if you like this, you probably have an intimate relationship with your tv set, too..please, kids...demand better. get the earlier dregs stuff, its great. this is not.this is a not very good attempt at a sell-out."
4,A good read,"This is an important book. Its thesis, that daily life has been colonised by financial circuits of capital, is an important one to explore. The book is accessible to a wider readership."
2,Not what I expected,"There is only one workout with baby on here. I was thinking that I would get to use my baby as a weight or something, but even part of the mommy-baby workout is just doing exercises while your baby is near you.I was also kind of shocked to see how out of shape this woman was. I get it- she just had a baby. But I would much rather take my workout advice from someone who isn't desperately sucking in her stomach.Lastly, you need a a ball to do some of these exercises. I was pretty disappointed with this video."
2,Unfortunate,When I bought this DVD I was not made aware that it requires other fitness equipment I dont own. It requires te big yoga ball as well as the bands. Thus I did not use this DVD but one time since I didn't have the other equipment. Moreover it is not advanced enough for me.
2,Disappointing,"I didn't realize that I would need small fitness balls to do most of the exercises on this dvd. I already have a good amount of exercise equipment so I'm not excited about having more to clutter up my living room. Also, very few of the exercises involved the baby."
4,My Daughter Loves It,"Who can argue with a five-year-old? My daughter loves this Bratz Big Babyz Katia doll as if it's her own daughter. She enjoys brushing and styling her hair. She sleeps with the doll almost every night and she plays ""Mommy"" to the doll almost all of the time.The doll comes with a hairbrush, birth certificate, and the trademark ""bottle-on-a-chain"" that has become synonymous with the Bratz ""Babyz"" line.I used to think that Bratz were a little too scandalous for young girls to play with, what with their tiny skirts and tanktops. However, MGA has made some recent adjustments to the doll line, such as adding the Babyz line, that have won me over. With that said, I have to give a solid recommendation to this Bratz doll."
1,Proceed with Caution!,"I couldn't believe the price for these ink cartridges, and should have known better. I used the first one for my Epson Color Stylus 960 printer today. The printer was smart enought to know it wasn't really compatible, and read as still empty for that color. The plastic cases in this set are just slightly shorter than the real Epson cartridges. The worst part was that when I attempted to remove the cartridge, the membrane had already been punctured, and magenta ink ran into my printer, onto my hand and dripped onto my brand new carpet. I learned a lesson the hard way."
4,He's Worthy is worthy to be owned,V.I.P. is going places in gospel music. This is one of the best CD's out there. Their sound is unlike anyone in gospel music today. The track He's Worthy made me want to get out my seat and dance like David danced.
3,From Back Cover,"When Aurora 'Rory' Constable and Tucker Schulz are thrown together at a 'lock and key' party, the attraction is undeniable. Despite the simmering sexual tension between them, they decide to fight their feelings and just be friends... until they win a weekend together to explore all the other ways they could fit together...With Tucker's skillful hands all over her before they even set out, Rory is soon hot and bothered. Cooling down with the resort's specialty drink - liquid sex - isn't likely to help! How is she going to maintain her 'friends only' no sex-vow when she's this close to a man she wants day and night?[3rd in the Lock & Key series]"
1,Trash,"Did I say trash?Want to know Charlie? Read David Robinson's ""Chaplin, his life and art"" in conjunction with Chaplin's own ""My Autobiography"".This one... TRASH!"
1,A truely biased Bio. an epic waste of time and money.,"I was at first rather impressed by the epic size of the book thinking it must contain something new about the comedian. Well, I was wrong. It was long, tedious and nasty. Granted, Chaplin was not perfect, but the author's preoccupation with his imperfections borders on sickening. A better title for this book would be 'Trash, what I think of Charlie'. Joyce Milton would do well writing for tabloids..."
2,For Completists Only,"While she does trod some new ground here, Joyce Milton's biography is recommended only for those who have already viewed the original movies, and read David Robinson's definitive biography, CHAPLIN, Charles Maland's CHAPLIN AND AMERICAN CULTURE, Walter Kerr's THE SILENT CLOWNS, and seen Brownlow and Gill's documentary, THE UNKNOWN CHAPLIN. Joyce's emphasis is on Chaplin's politics and relations with women. While these subjects are worthy of study, they are limiting in scope and do not provide a well-rounded portrait worthy of the artist and the man."
2,Unworthy of her subject,"The less said of this book the better. For the person interested in Chaplin's life and work, David Robinson's _Chaplin: His Life and Art_ remains the definitive volume. I highly recommend it and a Chaplin film festival from your video store. Don't waste your time and money on Milton's trash masquerading as a respectable bio"
2,Don't Bother,"The author of this book obviously has no empathy for Chaplin and because of this the reader does not get a ""feel"" for the real man. Chaplins life was anything but dull, however this book is."
5,EXCELLENT! AN ABSORBING GLIMPSE INTO A HOLLYWOOD LONG GONE,"I just finished reading this book and couldn't put it down!It is a truly engrossing look at the life, and the times, of an artist who truly defined the art of film-making through his work. I found Ms. Milton's work to be painstakingly thorough, even-handed, and balanced. She really draws you in until you feel as though you're looking over Chaplin's shoulder throughout the book. A truly great read for any buff of Chaplin and/or old-time Hollywood. BRAVO!However, I do have one gripe...Ms. Milton's effort deserved a more diligent proofreading, prior to publication.All in all, though, this is a wonderful book."
2,I don't like this book. It's not a very good book.,"Highly dissapointed. There are comparisons of Laimo with King, Straub, etc. Are you kidding me? Laimo's style is more along the lines of Bentley Little and Edward Lee but with less writing style and creativity. Lots of gore for squirmish moments but nothing that really grips you like King's work. Laimo is Bentley Little Ultra Light. This is the second book I've read of his and likely the last.If you want real, honest, horror without the gore from a new(ish) writer try Nate Keynon instead."
3,Read this one as fast as possible!,I took about 4 & a half days to read this book & that was about a day & a half too long. The plot is silly & absurd. You shouldn't spend one moment of thought on how logical the story is. That will start to ruin it for you. It reminds me of early Graham Masterton. You decide if thats a good thing or not.
3,"Not bad, could be better","A well written novel, I thought this was more suspenseful than scary. Perhaps my biggest complaint was the ""Deus Ex Machina"" style way of accomplishing the false hope, a use of previously unreferenced villianry that lacked development. It was almost as if he got tired and bored and said the hell with it, or maybe he had a deadline and didn't have time to fully treat this part of the story...?"
2,deep in the darkness? deep in to foolishless?,"this book was very disappoointing to me. the story, itself was silly & unrealistic, which makes reading it very hard, and the script-line was not able to keep me interested, i did not finish the read to theend of story. i would not tell/encorage anyone to read this book; it was such a sorry tale to me & there were no feae/scary pars in it!!!!after this book, i dont wont any other/more books by the author, michael laimo!!!!!"
3,Something was missing,"Although the story is thrilling, I was left puzzled by its ending. The writing is good and the author did a great job of keeping me interested until the end.Still, The Basenji Revelation by Simon Cleveland remains on the top of my list as far as horror is concerned."
3,this is a beginners camera,"this camera is good for its money, and it has red-eye reduction, which is always a plus. it has easy film loading, which is also a plus. unfourtunately, it is does not take the highest quality pictures."
4,great back stretcher,I have played volleyball for over 20 years and all those jumping eventually caused back pain for the last 7 years. Since I got the the inversion table on the first use I had one of the best night sleep I haven't had in such a long time. It's been about a month and I can feel my back getting better each day. It's worth paying for the extra release bar. Good luck with your back.
3,Quick & Easy Instruction Sheet,"This is not a book. It is 12 pages of instructions with hand drawn illustrations of the block units. If all you want are instructions on ""How to"" make a traditional Cathedral Window block, then this over priced (my personal opinion) booklet is for you. I feel the price is too high for 12 pages. However, the information is very easy to follow. I do like that each page of instruction is self-contained. By that I mean, each page covers one step or two. There is a page on how to finish off the quilt edge. There is a page on measurement and calculating foundation fabric yardage (this is very useful). And there is a chart on the last page that you can copy to plan the color layout of your units.There are no color pictures of any finished projects. There is credit mention for the two quilts on the front cover..."
1,Got to be kidding,"The price of this book is about 8 times what it is worth. First of all, it is not a ""paperback""; it is a ""pamphlet"". There is no firm cover or back. I feel taken advantage of when I order a book expecting a book and get a pamphlet. Some pages held together and called a ""paperback""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Simply the Best!,"Colinite is truly an undiscovered gem. With no spending on the marketing hype that others spend BIG bucks on, they have developed a clearly superior product, at an affordable price. As other reviewers have stated, a little of this stuff goes a long way, it is effortless to apply, and produces a result (especially on darker colors)that is unsurpassed. I am a car geek - life is too short to drive an ugly car - and have tried dozens of the competition's products. Many are quite good, and usually cost a lot more. Now I will wait and see if the positive comments as to longevity also prove to be true. I expect that they will. An unqualified recommendation for Colinite. Thanks for developing a great product."
5,Great Wax!!!,This product is very easy to apply and take off. But what I like most is that due to its viscous consistency it is less likely to build up in crevices relative to more liquid like wax or powdery-when-dry products. My only complaint is the bottle top which should be redesigned for better application to a pad. I lost a lot of product on the floor due to the difficulty of getting it out. The wax itself is definitely one of the best I've used.
5,"So far, so good","I work with someone with a few years experience as an automotive detailer....this guy is as ""anal"" as can be when it comes to car care. After listening to his repeated ""ravings"" about this product I finally decided to purchase a bottle. Because it is not sold by any local retailers it was necessary to purchase online. The product arrived on schedule, well packaged. The wax is easy to apply and remove. Unlike many automobile waxes it does not have cleaning properties. If you attempt to wax over water spots you are likely to end up with a shiny water spot, in other words, make sure the surface is clean before waxing. I applied a single coat approximately six weeks ago. After a half-dozen car washes and a week of light rain from hurricane Sandy, the wax appears to be holding up well. Admittedly this isn't much of a test, but ""so far so good""."
2,Thinner than water,Product was very watery. It spilled when I applied it to my wax applicator. The mouth of the bottle was too big. It did not remove water spots.
3,not the most comfortable bra,"I had Bali bras before and thought this one will offer same support and comfort like few others. It offers good support, minimizes at least 1"", but it's not very comfortable and the sizing is not very accurate. I'll continue to try and, hopefully, I'll find a good 36D bra for myself."
2,Does not do the job,This bra did not live up my wife's expectations. The write-up was good but did not fit or enhance as expected.
1,Will be returning,"I have 34dd breasts and I usually buy from victorias secret because I find their bras most comfortable but I was looking for a cheaper option and this had such great reviews. I don't know how anyone would like this bra. The fabric is cheap and very scratchy, the straps don't have much room to adjust, and it was very unflattering when I tried it on. I am only 21 so my boobs are still quite perky but this bra just squished them down and did not lift at all."
2,UNCOMFORTABLE,THIS BRA CAME AT THE SAME TIME AS A VANITY FAIR. IT IS EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
3,"Great bra, but itchy!","This bra does what it's supposed to do: it fits well, it offers great support, the wide straps are very comfortable, it minimizes, it doesn't show under t-shirts, BUT it makes me itch, even after it's been washed several times. I wonder what Bali is using in their bras these days; a friend of mine who prefers another Bali style actually lines the cups with tissues because her bra is so itchy! It's a shame that this very good design is ruined by whatever causes the itch."
5,Comfortable support,Outstanding....soft and supportive....wide straps soft and comfortable over the shoulders...... 4 hooks for strength across the back.....clothing looks great over this bra
5,Best,Best lift and support for us lucky girls that are well built. Have not found a better bra and believe me I have looked. Very comfortable and easy to wash. Amazon has a great price and shipped fast.
5,Perfect fit,This bra is very comfortable and fits well without riding up.More colors in the larger sizes would be nice but it it still a quality bra for the price.
4,Needs some stretch in the straps,"I bought this because it was the closest style to an older Bali bra I had. This fit fine and overall is a good product. There is only one complaint I have. There is no stretch in the straps. They can be adjusted, but that is not the same as having elastic in them. As a result, I find they don't always stay put. However, the rest of the bra fits well and is quite comfortable."
1,Painful underwire!! and underwire is all I wear!,"I am a 38 DDD, when I put this on in the store I thought ""Great! Its fits and it's affordable!"" Then I wore it for an hour...these underwires have NO cushion at all, the wire is thin gauge and it just jams you right on the ribs...aweful!!! For big girls, Wacoal is worth the $65!!"
2,Meh,"They actually had my size and the bra fits correctly. but it's incredibly scratchy. I already pulled off the tags, so I doubt I can send it back."
5,Just as I expected - great!,This is a product I am familiar with but I was able to get it here for a much better price.
5,Best Bra ever,"Well made, comfortable, attractive, flattering. As a slender but large busted woman I have trouble finding bras that fit and are comfortable. Most DD cup bras start at size 36"",""Live it up"" comes in a 34"" has no seams that show holds the girls up with good side support, no padding and no extra giggle. I wear this bra for almost everything from office to low impact sports."
5,bras,Fit well. Good support. I always wear this brand but had not bought this style before. Will purchase more like this.
4,Really Good,Bali always has very good quality products. This bra has super comfortable shoulder straps. It lives up to Bali's quality.
3,bali bra,"This bra is okay, but like any other bra with a wire in it-it still pokes me under the arm pit as the day wares on."
2,misleading title,"I was looking forward to receiving this tape based on the title and the fact that it had won a Parents Choice Award. I was disappointed to see that there was as much if not more singing and dancing than trains. The cartoon character was insignificant and doesn't captivate children. The human characters with their song and dance routines were a bit ""cheesy"". Half the trains shown were model/toy trains. There was some good information about trains, but a video like There Goes a Train is much more thorough and informative. All in all, Trains - Lots of Trains it was not. However, I am giving it 2 stars because after several fustrated viewings by my 2yr-old son (upset because they kept cutting away from trains for more dialogue), he now seems to be enjoying it."
1,Cheap speaker wire,"I bought this speaker wire thinking that it wouldn't be that bad. But the cable is very cheaply made. The outer jacket is made of thin cheap plastic, and the insulation covering the wire itself was just as thin. and each strand of the wire itself was pretty thick. Overall avoid buying this item. Parts express had excellent customer service and refunded my money right away. In the future if i find something i need, i will buy through part express!"
2,"Black tigers, i think.","Well, these are quite weird, they are from Cincinnati Ohio, but they are not of the UV 500 finish... disappointing. the cards were also chipped, and uneven with the positioning of its card borders"
2,I haven't even finished it yet.,"I love Tanith Lee. I have just about everything published by Tanith Lee. If you asked me, this book is not by Tanith Lee. What I want to know is, WHO ARE YOU & WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH TANITH LEE???"
2,Not So Much,"I was attracted to this collection by reviews and the great price. Since purchasing it, I have acquired theComplete Savoy & Dial Studio Recordings 1944-1948, which is a lot more expensive. But if you can possibly afford it, there is no comparison. Quite a few of the mixes on this collection are really not very good at all, and side-by-sides with versions from the box set are, at times, startling. Not that this set is terrible for the price, but once you've heard remastering done at the highest level, these versions can be hard to come back to.If you are thinking about the box set, you may see complaints about the packaging, which, it's true, is not great. But who cares. These recordings, particularly the Dial recordings, are some of the most sublime I have ever heard."
2,A few good insights,"I hate to not rave about this, because the author seems like a great teacher and observer of children, but as a parent looking to understand the reasons why my son might be interested in violence I didn't finish the book with much more than a few good insights scattered throughout the book (mainly coming from an older child she talked to.)I found the detailed conversations of the kids to go on for way too long and ended up scanning trying to find her thoughts and observations.I loved the way she lead the kids in her class to make their own rules for violent games and I may use some of that myself with my son, but I can see it being more helpful for a teacher than a parent.Also, the focus on violent media was mostly about bloody scary/horror movies and didn't address cartoon violence or video-game violence. So I DID learn to avoid the blatantly scary movies (which most parents probably would anyhow) but I didn't learn much about the impact of other media."
1,Do not waste your money!,"I am a MCSE who looked at this book for use when studying for my tests. Now, a networking class is using this as a manual and I have to say something. This book does not cover the material well enough to take the tests nor in depth enough to actually do Enterprise networking with NT."
5,Clear and full of key details,"I've long been a fan of the Nolo Press legal guides, but when I came across this in a local library, I took it home for a read and was very impressed. In a very readable manner, it explains the various choices; it also has forms and state-by-state information. I'm involved with two groups considering nonprofit status and it brought out many good points we hadn't thought of."
1,Don't waste your money,"The book is simplistic and states the obvious; you can find most of the information for free on the web. Buy Allison Kaye's ""Strategic Planning for Nonprofit Organizations"" instead . It's well worth the extra money"
4,The Hobo Philosopher,"I have had a long interest in Robert Service. This book has only served to wet my appetite. Robert was obviously quite a daring guy. I knew that he was more than a simple bank teller. But I think that I would rather be reading Mr. Service write about himself than get the story secondhand. I've got to get one of his autobiographies next.Richard Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:""A Little Something: Poetry and Prose"""
1,Dont buy this item,"Crappy product, the razor is ok, but the chrome soap bowl rusted in one day (no exaggeration) because after using it for the first time, a drop of water remained at the bottom-immedately rusted. the brush is ok but the stand was lopsided and promptly broke when i tried to bend it straight. spend the extra money on something from a quality company like Caswell Massey or something. (my two cents)"
4,Great early 80's pop,"I have this on vinyl. It was my parents record originally. ""Once Before I Go"" is gorgeous, and most of the rest is extremely catchy. Some might find this too campy or just plain tacky, but from hearing this album since I was a kid, I've grown quite fond of it. As a musician it goes against my general sense of taste, but this sort of thing is not about ascetics. Sorry, it just ain't."
4,Is He Dead?,"Condition of the book was just as stated, cost was reasonable and delivery was timely. I would do business again with this vendor."
3,Tyrone Messed Up A Good Thing!,"This is an explosive cd! On all tracks, new members,Harold Beane(guitar), and Tyrone Lampkin(drums) were added. They had not rehearsed with P-Funk. Listening to Tyrone, he messed up a good thing!Listen to the late Eddie Hazel's masterpiece ""Maggot Brain"" (track#2). And you'll see what I'm talking about!"
5,Simply amazing,"Everything in this book, the writing, the characterizations, the plot, the setting, everything, is simply astounding. It draws you in and holds your interest like very few books. Definitely a classic, and certainly for anyone who wants to read a well written book with meaningful content. This book is a masterpiece of literature. It not only towers over all the piddling ""pop"" literature that spews from the presses nowadays, but it is a titan over genuine quality literature."
3,"I know it has merit, I just couldn't follow it","I'm told I went about this book all wrong: I read it from beginning to end. Apparently, I should have started with the last part and then gone back to the beginning. Unless you're a lirerary genius, I wouldn't recommend tackling this book on your own (that is without the assistance of a literature class). Once I understood the story, the first three parts made sense and I must say they are quite an accomplishment. Faulkner really gets into the head of each character, but so much so, that if you're not dysfunctional enough, it's next to impossible to follow. While I realize that this book is praised to the high heavens as a major milestone in literary accomplishment, I give it three stars, because I believe that while literature shouldn't cater to the lowest common denominator, it should at least be decipherable to intelligent, educated people (I would consider myself a member of this group)."
2,Not for casual reading,"Like the many recent Academy Award winning films, which are painful to watch and win awards because of the utilization of a bold new method or a controversial topic, The Sound and the Fury leaves those seaking pleasure and entertainment extremely wanting and those reading academically enthralled. To that end, unless you are looking to read the book to impress your English professor, don't waste your time with this book. Not only does the story turn out to lack complexity and intrigue, but three-quarters of the novel is largely illegible. English professors and those that aspire to such, will say that this was the innovation of some kind of new method and is literature at its best, but for those that read for something other than academic study, it is grueling to read through."
1,The Sound and the Fury,"This is the first book on the Easton list that I have been unable to finish. I read almost half of the book and had no idea what it was about. From my understanding, the book is divided into four sections. The first three sections are written as stream-of-conscious. I hate this writing style, which is probably why I had difficulty paying attention."
2,Too Much!,"This book, although beautifully written, is attempting to capture a myriad of topics into one digestible story. Racism, incest, thievery, ...you name it, this book tries to embrace it! If it were a simple story, the subject matter may have kept my interest. However, Faulkner's writing style of character based sections made the reading experience harder to enjoy."
1,Confusing story due to shifting viewpoints and times,"I have a degree in literature, and even in college, I did not understand The Sound and the Fury. I thought that when I became older I would understand, but this story is too confusing. I did not finish it. The first chapter does not establish a sound viewpoint. I feel I am missing a great story here, but the author did not provide me with the tools necessary to accomplish an ending."
1,Please,"I enjoy reading the masters and their classic books. But any book that I have to stop reading so that I can reference the internet to understand what is happening is no classic in my opinion. This was my first Faulkner book, and if the rest are written anything like this, it will be my last. You just shouldn't need to have a college professor explaining a book to you to be able to enjoy it. Most people reviews I've read say the first chapter is the hardest. But I found myself reading through most of the second chapter as fast as I could just to try to get past it also. If I wasn't so intent on reading all the great classics, I would have put this book down after the first half hour of reading and never picked it back up."
1,Dreadful - this work has got The South a bad name,"I must be odd or poorly-educated (or both) for I cannot for the life of me see how William Faulkner could have won on merit a Nobel Prize for literature nor two Pulitzer Prizes. Admittedly, I had not tackled the gentleman's work before 'The Sound and The Fury,' but, having struggled with this book and having attempted 'As I Lay Dying,' I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that I wasted my money buying the books, that Mr Faulkner's English and writing abilities were dreadful, and that the author's story-lines are incomprehensible. It appears that Faulkner's stories are almost all placed in The South of the United States. I love The South. I fear that William Faulkner and his works, especially this one, have got The South a bad name."
2,why a classic?,"I figured if Oprah wanted America to read this book that it couldn't be too bad. I had held out on reading Faulkner, and now I know why. I read alot and love reading but this book, and ""As I Lay Dying"" makes me question why oh why Faulkner is a classic. My hypothesis is that its so unapproachable therefore people think it must be brilliant. This is a good book for english class when you can sit around and discuss the meanings of it all and read sparknotes together. This is not a book for sitting at home and reading for yourself. If you want to know the story just go read the sparknotes version. The book itself is too hard to figure out and there is little plot. its just a long headache really."
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Remember that story? It was about a kingdom of people who were so afraid of looking foolish that they went along with whatever they were told. They took their cue from their vain and silly king, who had so little character that he let a conman convince him to walk naked in a royal procession. Enough said."
1,This is a strange book.,I do not like this book. Do not buy it. It is the worst book I have ever read.
1,excrutiating,"This was an excruciating reading experience. An uninteresting story, badly written. Memo to the reading public: do not get on a plane to L.A. with only this book to read.GRADE: F"
1,Sound and Fury by Faulkner is no longer a good read.,This work by Faulkner is no longer appropriate to the times. It has no place in our current American way of life or desire for good reading.
3,Typical classic,Hard to get into the story line. Lay out and language of a typical classic making it hard to fallow and understand.
3,fast shipping !,"The seller really got this book to me fast! I appreciated that a lot. I know the book was used a little older; however it was a little more beaten up than I expected. It didn't really matter to me that much though, I bought it cheap and its still a great read.Thanks"
1,Misspelled words throughout the text,The content of the book is confusing enough without the geneology of the family but the misspelling of 'back' as 'black' throughout this book is adding insult to injury. Its horrible - I'm not even confident that this book is legit so I had to purchase another copy...I will not be buying from this seller again. Beware...apparently you have to ask for a corrected text copy.
1,It's a good book. . . to help you go to sleep,"In my opinion this book is horrible. every word in the book left me utterly confused. I have read other reviews here and I see that many people who have read the book say that ""it's a good book but I needed the cliff notes"". Well, if it really is a great book it should hace captivated you as the reader and let the words flow instead of reading a section and than have to consult your cliff notes. If you want to read a GOOD Faulkner book, I suggest as I Lay Dying. That book is truely a masterpiece."
2,vastly overated,"Not as difficult to read as I had expected from all the hype. The problem is that once you understand the complicated way of writing,you realise how little has actually been said. Jason's part was probably the best, but the author really took everyone for a ride. A case of the Emperor's new clothes I'm afraid, ... just being difficult to understand doesn't make it good ..."
1,The Sound and the Frustration,"This is not a book for the casual reader interested in familiarizing himself/herself with the classics. If you enjoy a book that has a narrative that you can understand, then this book is probably not for you.I suppose if you want to really study Faulkner so that you can get in on all of his inside jokes and hidden symbolism, then this book is for you. (The rest of us have jobs and lives outside of the University.)"
4,Difficult But Worthwhile,"This is a difficult book to read. Points-of-view shift, the past and present are inseparable, characters have limited perceptions, and the story only gradually comes into focus. I am glad I started with ""As I Lay Dying,"" ""Collected Stories,"" and ""Absalom, Absalom,"" or I would be hard put to have finished this fascinating, frustrating novel. If you've not tried Faulkner before, this is not the one to start with."
1,I hated it and couldn't even finish it.,"It was probably the most confusing book I have ever tried to read. I wondered if it really was that confusing or was I just dense, so I looked up some reviews. It is, by all accounts, very confusing with the jumps in time. I don't mind stretching my brain a little to read a book, it doesn't have to be just pure entertainment, but trying to follow the characters and the jumping back and forth in time and place was just more work than it was worth. I gave up after the first part. I know it is supposed to be one of the best books ever written which is why I chose to read it in the first place, but I'm not willing to work that hard to figure out what the author is trying to say. I'm not a college professor, just a reasonably bright guy who likes to get some enjoyment as well as a learning experience from reading."
5,A must-read...,"I was introduced to ""Sound and Fury,"" and Faulkner for that matter in college. I was wholly unprepared as an average American videophile for reading on this level. Without notes I would've never made it through. But now that I've got this one under my belt, I'm infinately better for it. It truly expanded my reading capacity.I'm also better for having experienced Faulkner's story telling. The dialogue -- Benjy! -- is so very well done. I always considered Twain to be the premier Southern American novelist, but now I'd argue for Faulkner.To date, I've read this novel three times and have also read two others of Faulkner's. If you're new to Faulkner, begin here. ""Sound and Fury"" is a cake walk compared to ""Absalom, Absalom."" But once you tackle ""Sound"" you'll be more than able to go after anything else of Faulkner's. And you most certainly will!"
2,Pretty Bad,"I write this review realizing that this book is considered a classic, and people much more intelligent than I consider this book brilliant. But I didn't enjoy reading it. The whole `stream-of-consciousness' style of writing is very hard to follow (especially coming first person from a mentally handicapped individual). I finished the book only because I hate not finishing books.On a positive note, the last two sections of the book are readable. In fact, the book actually gets somewhat interesting with these two chapters. I can identify with the reviewer who wrote that he felt Jason was his hero in the story. Though Jason was a rotten individual, it was a relief to be able to read something understandable. Now that I know `classics' can be this bad, I am not as excited to read them as I was before encountering this book."
1,Huh?!,"I absolutely enjoy reading classics and because this was mentioned on the great 100 books list, I thought i might give it a shot.My GOD it was so hard to read. I truly do enjoy challenges but i couldn't understand what the heck was going on through most of the first half of the book.I do understand the purpose of Faulkner writing in so many different dialects/styles however it was painful to read. I finally had to set the book aside and read a synopsis of the book to really understand what the heck was going on and even after reading that, I seriously questioned how one could possibly pick up on those nuances from reading the book.This book is impossibly difficult to read and frankly, for what the actual plot ended up being, really not worth it. I am still confounded as to why this book is even considered a classic."
3,Not a masterpiece,"I think this novel is really overrated.Maybe it was a new way to write or something, but the reading is heavy, slowed and really hard for a ""normal"" reader."
5,Complex and powerful,After you get to the last page you will want to go back to the first and start reading it again. The way in which Faulkner let me into the intimate details of the Compson family's convoluted lives made me feel like I was sharing their secrets and heartaches. If you like books that spell everything out for you in black and white - you won't like this book!
5,I did NOT overrate this book,"Though it is certainly not for everyone, it remains to be a work of a creative genius. The writing style is very unorthodox, and it is very compelling and powerful. I especially loved the narrative told by the mentally retarded Benjy, and the characters are highly developed and you get to know them. If you have a long attention span and undertake the challenge of reading this book and succeed, it will whisp you away to a different place where you are in the South and in Southern psyches that snowball down a hill."
3,parts greater than the whole,"Falukner shows us his subject, the heroine Caddy, thru three pairs of eyes, her brothers'. Frankly, the brothers are more arresting the our heroine. We are permitted plenty of stream-of-consciousness with Quentin, Benjy, and Jason, but never are we allowed into the Caddy's soul. I know he had his reasons for concealing, but it flaws the novel. Mr. Compson, penultimate cynic, and Mrs. Compson, obnoxious hypochondriac, are both sharply and convincingly drawn. Jason is a classic. Benjy and Quentin are not believable though intensely painted."
2,Too confusing,"Faulkner is good and all, but the book loses too much as it is all out of order. It's like he had the original manuscript and then dropped it and the it fell all over the place and he picked it back up and said, hey, it's a book. it reminded me a lot of pulp fiction in that respect. The only challenging part if reorganizng. After thathe book is pretty basic. they should publish an edition all strightened out and in order, like they did with the godfather."
2,"For scholars, not for pleasure.",It was a book club selection and I had no idea how convoluted and difficult it was to read. I know it is considered a classic but it certainly wasn't a book to be read for pleasure. It's more of a scholars read.
2,Try A Written Version,"""The Sound and The Fury"" is reported as one of William Faulkner's early successes. From this performance I have trouble understanding why. The book alternates between dialogue and descriptive narration. I had trouble following the story. It sounded like a series of barely related scenes.I did listen to a recording of this book. I do have more trouble following recordings of fiction than I do with history. It may be that I would do better reading this book than listening to it. There was nothing technically wrong with the recording, I am just hopeful that a written version would be more understandable. I would recommend giving a written version at try."
1,Most. Overrated. Book. Ever.,"We exchange a lot of books with my in-laws and this book was in one of the latest bags, so I thought it would be a good opportunity to finally read Faulkner. I struggled through the whole thing because it is supposedly a classic. The stream of consciousness style of the the first (and also the second) chapters is certainly painful to read. But even beyond that, the book starts nowhere, ends absolutely nowhere, and has little of interest in between. The characters are not interesting. They don't do anything interesting. Their thoughts, the main feature of the book, are not interesting. The one good thing about reading this book is that I can cross the rest of Faulkner's works off my ""classics I want to read someday"" list."
1,"I love literature, but I will never read Faulkner again","Simply put, I do not understand how this book can be called one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Just because it's different does not mean it's good. Anyone can write a stream of consciousness but to make it into a story is something else. Apparently that was not Faulkner's intention."
2,Depressing,"Aren't there enough bad things in life? Why read about it in a depressing, confusing manner. I read a lot and if this is indicitive of Falkner's style, then consider him checked off my list of authors to read."
3,Not an enjoyable book to read.,"The Story was good but the writing style was too confusing. I read it because I had to. If I didn't have to, I would have stopped after the first 30 pages. It is artistic and origional: yes, but is it enjoyable to read: no. If you want to read a good classic, read The Grapes of Wrath."
3,Well...,I'm not really sure what I think about this book. The overall story and themes of the book were great. It's a very interesting look at the downfall of a Southern aristocratic family in the early 1900s spanning many family members and many years. Each chapter (4 in all) is from a different family member's point of view so there's drastic changes in writing styles. The first two chapters are fairly difficult to read but they also provide the most interesting insights into the family. This is one of those novels that you enjoy thinking back on it after you're done reading and not as much while you read it. Does that make sense?
5,Signifying More Than Nothing,"It is hard to dislike this novel as it is such a classic -- the three bothers each bring such interesting observations. Benjy, in particular, is a character that has had an enormous impact on my life."
1,Surprise! Surprise!,"I was surprised to find this book to be an utter nonsense.I could never understand why this book was so highly rated over the years.I could not establish connection,time,motivation among characters.The interactions among characters are vague. May be it would have been better if the form was drama instead of a novel."
1,"Apparently, I don't like Faulkner","Seems like Faulkner is an acquired taste I was unable to acquire... I tried to stay with it as long as I could, but found myself skimming pages less than half way through. I can't put my finger on any specific aspect of his writing style that made me want to give up on the book... It's just a painful read. I'm resigned to accept that I don't ""get it""."
2,Hard,Still reading it. But it's very hard to read. But I'm sure it's a great novel if i were smarter.
3,Quality hardware,"I had to read this book for a class, it was alright. The book itself is constructed well, though. A quality book."
1,unintellegible,"I'm sorry, but I can't agree with the other readers' enthusiasm. I found ""The sound and the fury"" a terrible book. Of course I can't but admire Falukner's technique, but, for Christ's sake, the plot is completely unintelegible! It took me a week just to find out who was who (why, I wondered, Quentin is a ""he"" and a couple of pages later becomes a ""she""?). As for who did what, well that is still wrapped in mistery. A book that will give you a headache."
3,"technically brilliant, but not really Faulkners best","The structure of this, the time shifts, the way sense impressions bleed into and out of each other, is really something to be in awe of. Especially in the incredibly hard to read first section. Like the other Faulkner I've read I found reading the sound and the fury was not so much a matter of difficulty as it was of sensing out the rhythm, of picking up the cycles of these people's minds, especially Benjy and Quentin. That being said, I didn't really care for it. The characters, while well rendered, didn't have the same emotional gravity for me that the Bundren's did in As I Lay Dying, or Joe Christmas and Issac do in Light in August and The Bear. The decline of the Compson family is tragic, but I had trouble finding much pathos in it. Faulkner's technical achievement here is definitely something to admire, I'm just not sure how much it's something to love.("
3,Sound and the Hype,"Okay, how on Earth do I try and inject my opinion on this classic? And what if I didn't get much out of it?I had put this one off for so long simply because I stumbled in those first pages, because of the difficult of Benjy's section. And this time I just plowed through, resorting to sparknotes to straighten out what I read. Quentin's sections were only somewhat more lucid, but I was looking for the motives to his future actions and the only answer I found seemed a little limited. Truthfully, I wasn't happy until I got to the omniscient third person. This is the Faulkner I like, but still it wasn't the Faulkner of If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem. I wanted the long, expansive, descriptive paragraphs. There was plenty of heartbreak here, plenty of tragedy and I was grateful for it.While I'm happy to tick another classic off my to-read list, I wish I would have taken more away from the experience."
3,Interesting but exhausting.,"This is not a novel for the light-hearted or those with a short attention-span. If you enjoy Faulkner and his nuances I reccommend picking up what is considered to be one of his classics. Otherwise if you are reading this out of obligation, I recommend also getting the sparks notes, or you will be utterly lost in a sea of psycho-babble and what may or may not be stream-of-conciousness. Scholars are still debating what to classify it as. All I know is that its definitely fine literature, but it is a difficult read."
3,flawed but excelent in parts,"The good fragments in this book are worth 5 stars, but the book fails as a whole. Quentin's section was a great lyric but Quentin himself was not believable. Mr. Compson, Jason, Mrs. Comspon, and a few minor characters were dead on. Caddy is vague, and somehow I sympathized with Jason more (perhaps because he is painted in human colors). And to sympathize with Jason more than with Caddy isn't what Willy intended. Be prepared to hunt through coal for the books honest diamonds."
3,Difficult to listen to...,"The Sound And The Fury is written in ""stream of consciousness"" through the first two sectoions. The first section in particular jumps from one period to another randomly. If one is not aware of this, he/she will not be able to follow the story. I was completely lost in my attempt to listen to this book.Faulkner is actually pretty clever in his approach to this book. I was not able to appreciate this because I attempted to listen to it without knowing what to expect. I will likely read the book and I think I will enjoy it more, having a better idea of whom the primary characters. I would not suggest listening to this novel."
3,start with the last chapter,"I truly admire Faulkner's obvious talent; however this book is more work to read than it is worth. It's partial plot is told from four perspectives, one of which is a tangential, time-warped mess that is nearly unreadable. It's suppose to be Benjy's (the idiot's) recollections. Another section in written in that awful stream-of-consciousness ala Joyce and Woolfe. There's only one admirable character who tries to keep some order among the ""sound and fury"". When you finally figure out what's going on, have some Prozac at the ready. This is a dark and depressing book that I wish I hadn't read"
5,Absolutely stunning,"I read this work a few years ago, and seemed to get most of what Faulkner was trying to convey. However, it wasn't until I took a 20th-century American literature class in college that I realized the massive intellectual force that this book represents. As trite as it may sound, it was one of those rare moments in a person's life that you look up, stare off into space for a few seconds, and say to yourself, ""I didn't know you could do that!"" I became aware of a greater potential in the world around me (yes, it sounds metaphysical as hell, but it's the truth). Those of you who do read this book, and are not touched in some way by its brilliance, all I can say is that you have my sympathy and my pity. Those of you who are touched, I need say no more. It is the best book I have ever read. Period."
1,El yucko.,"So inaccessible. In the end, so unsatisfying. Just depressing. Like being on a three-week drunken spree. Yuck."
1,Waited almost 4 weeks for the book!,"I order regularly from Amazon because of how quickly I usually receive the merchandise. However, I needed this book by December 17th, I ordered it on November 29th. It did not arrive on time."
1,No Book Has Ever Been Worse,"I read this book almost 20 years ago, but my feelings about it have dimmed not at all: THIS WAS EXCRUCIATING TO READ!!!From overdone prose to long-winded sentences that go nowhere, from punchless dialogue to non-existent suspense, this was the worst book I have ever read. I don't recommend this over-praised book to anyone unless they're having trouble inducing a headache for themself to suffer."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I didn't want to read past the first chapter. I know, everyone says it gets better but even when I skipped ahead I still wasn't interested in the characters or story.Also, I hate it when characters are given the same name, especially when one is male and the other is female."
4,Outtakes cd is a gem of a find!,"The official Art Vandelay Tapes is a true find. Outtakes, B-sides unavailable before on cd. Many are A-side quality. A re-worked version of the Who's Substitute is a treat. Parker freaks, find this and enjoy!"
5,Extras,"It just baffles me how Graham Parker's throwaways would make someone else a top shelf star! Listen to these gems and you tell me! Some of these have appeared before but they sound somewhat fresh but always enjoyable. I am also convinced that true stardom never eluded GP - GP eluded stardom! Awesome songs, blood tingling lyrics (as always), and the usual tongue in cheek humor. If you haven't heard these you will LOVE them. If you're new you will LOVE them even more!! You cannot hid true talent nor true genius. nuff said!"
5,Great Insight!,I have worked with people who have special needs as well as having my own. This book had great insight about to how to deal with prejudice and love. The hero in this book thought he was more limitted than he was and he had his own prejudices to deal with. His experiences with prejudice did much to cause this. The heroine handles the situations with an insight that is wonderful and helpful for anyone dealing with such circumstances. The heroine really loves her man. (She even discovers that there is prejudice towards her because of her modeling job ). This book balances lessons and love well. Enjoy!
2,very limited scope,"This was good as an introduction to the sound/pronunciation of the Russian language, and the repetitiveness does imbed the vocabulary in your mind--but what useless vocabulary! Unless you are a guy traveling to Moscow to pick up a Russian girl (which is unnecessary b/c they will be looking for you regardless of whether you can speak the language) in which case it teaches you to invite her for a drink or out to eat, at a restaurant or ""at my place"". If you want more, look elsewhere."
5,Great introduction,"This is a great introduction to the Russian language. You won't be able to speak Russian when you're finished, but you'll have a few ""catch phrases"" to use and a fantastic accent. The repetition is excellent in committing the phrases to memory; very quickly, you find yourself being able to ""answer"" the prompt, instead of just repeating.It is by no means sufficient if you are interested in having anything more than an EXTREMELY basic knowledge of the language. But the pronunciation you'll learn, as well as the taste of Russian you get, is insurpassable."
4,"Reasonably effective, and at a good price","This course is slowly paced (which is probably a good thing, Russian is a tough language). The lessons really pound in a few concepts per module, so when you're done your skills won't be broad, but they will be reasonably deep. The other nice thing about this is it's strictly audio, none of this ""turn to your books"" stuff, which makes it perfect for a commuter. I've used several of these types of courses over the years, and this one is pretty good, as well as reasonably priced."
1,unacceptable,I haven't received anything yet. I will consider it very seriously before I purchase anything on Amazon again.
2,More Notes From the Obscure,"All I could do was be disappointed and I was. Ben Pleasants has a reputation for being a widely published journalist; maybe that's the problem? His Visceral Bukowski is more of an odd collection of unconnected articles than anything else. It is as if Pleasants has raked the obscure to try and pull up something worth telling, but all he could find was tabloid filler. For this reader, Pleasants' Visceral Bukowski is just another one of ""them"" - that, for whatever reason, was written to fuel the myth. The more I read of these things the more I become convinced that the only one to truly get below the myth and bring us an honest look at Bukowski was Cherkovski. As for the Visceral Bukowski, even the most avid Bukowski fan will fine this one a stretch."
3,A Dead Giveaway,"If a compilation begins with ""The Best Of ..."" you can almost be positive that it isn't. That isn't to say this album doesn't have the Best of the Zombies, but the problem is, the Zombies just weren't a monolithic band. They don't need an entire CD of hits, and the CD CERTAINLY doesn't need to be titled as ""The Best of the 60s."" Their version of ""Summertime"" is an interesting take, and ""She's Not There"" is a sleeper hit, gaining a bit more recognition with its use (although a cover) in ""Kill Bill, Vol 2."" ""Time of the Season"" is a must on a Zombies CD, but they really should've left ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me"" to Smokey.All in all, it's probably worth the less than $10 that you'll spend on it when you find it, but always, as in any compilation CD of essentially one-hit wonder bands, be aware that there are more duds than masterpieces. Especially when they begin with ""The Best Of ..."""
1,"Great style, poor reception","The phone has great vintage style but the sound quality is not there. When talking on the phone, there is a constant humming noise in the background. Irritating. Phone is being returned."
2,"Great looking, but cheaply made","I wanted a retro looking phone to put on top of our bar. The price is good, but with that saying, you also ""get what you pay for"". It's not a very heavy phone and mostly made of thin plastic. The look is good sitting on top of the bar, but the feel and weight says it's cheap. I went ahead and kept the phone and started using it, but after only a few weeks the ringer has already stopped working. I would not recommend this item."
3,To tuck under the chin....,"I wanted a phone with some heft,(so it wouldn't be dragged off the table)and one that I could tuck between my chin and collarbone to free up my hands. It was the right weight. But because of the shape of the spine on the handset (V shaped) I couldn't use it to tuck under my chin. I need a flat shape handset spine profile rather than a pointed one.All other features were perfect and well thought out. The old European styling was charming."
2,Disappointed,The phone has a very plastic feel to it and is much lighter than I expected after having read some of its other reviews. Made in China.
2,Should've lasted longer,"When I first got this phone, I immediately had doubts about its quality. The handset did not sit level on the base, a condition I have never run into with any phone at any price.The phone did work, and the sound was good. However, 3 years down the line it suddenly went ""click"" during a call and loud static in the background moved in.I'm recylcing the phone as it can't be used.Also, you can't remove the housing without cracking it or worse. It is very repair unfriendly. I would have liked to check if a wire had gotten loose, but it became pointless to do this because the phone's retro beauty would have been damaged in the process.The problem was the phone itself and not its wall connection.So I'm giving it 2 stars. A land phone that's not mistreated should last for years and years. This one is rather pricey and it didn't come close."
5,I love my phone!,"I love my phone. It's beautiful. I often let it ring several times before answering it, because the sound of the bell is delightful. The handset has weight and size in my hand, and my friends' and family members' voices sound like my friends' and family members' voices! Oh, and did I mention that it is red? A feast for the eyes even when it's just sitting there! There's no annoying answering machine blinking a to-do list at me when I come home from work exhausted (if it's really important, my cell phone has voice mail!)Thank you for selling me a product that has brought back beauty and pleasure to telephone communication."
1,For it's price I would expect a better quality item made in the USA and not in China.,"""The item is not solid metal, it is plastic with chrome finishing. For it's price I would expect a better quality item made in the USA and not in China. Ringer doesn't sound as loud as a vintage phone would ring. Don't buy it it is a waste of money."""
2,stopped working,"I bought this phone for my retro-basment. It worked about 6-9 months and then stopped. I replaced the cord with no avail. I paid $60 for it. It is a piece of junk! However, it does look good."
2,Phone just for looks,"I bought the Crosley phone and the Crosley wall phone. They look good, and I like the ring, but they are cumbersome to use for phone calls, and the sound quality is terrible. These phones are good for nostalgia and looks, not for use."
1,Crosley 302 -- made me Cross!,"The hardwired 7' cord is silly for a wall phone. I was intending to put a 25-50 cord on this given that's what it was intended to replace.The other issue is the ringer....they attribute the ""meek dingk"" ring to having too many phones plugged in which decreases volume. Hmmmm....the ORIGINAL BELL wall phone that was replaced didn't have any problem with decibels.While the looks and heft are nice, it doesn't make up for the other deficiencies. Conclusion: NOT WORTH the purchase price."
3,shoulder pain,I bought this phone because I was tired of having a long phone convo and the battery on my cordless needing to be recharged. The biggest issue with this phone is that is not comfortable on your shoulder and keeps slipping. Also it would be better if it had caller id on it.
1,"Terrible, It lasted one week and broke. I do not have the box,papers, or anything.So i'm stuck with a cheep phone that doesn't w","The phone is terrible. It lasted one week and broke. I would tell anyone not to but it, go elsewhere."
4,Fun Desk Phone,"I had looked a real 40's phones on ebay and they were expensive and generally didn't work. I saw this on Amazon and thought, this look is what I was after and this one works! It's not the cleanest sound, but quite acceptable. This phone lets me feel like Clark Kent sitting at my desk at the Daily Planet newspaper."
4,Red Desk Phone,"The only complaint I really have is that the dial is a little crooked. I wish it were a real dial, but the phone looks and works great!"
5,Christmas gift,Only place i could find such a unique item and at such a reasonable cost. It arrived in plently of time for Christmas.
3,Cute phone!,"My phone arrived with a few cosmetic imperfections. Scuffs and whatnot. Nothing worth the postage to return it. It works well. Very cute! Not quite the quality I hoped for, but I am very picky. Looks good with my ""modern classic"" style of decor."
1,Disaster,"This was a trap! I bought it thinking that it was a perfume,the price was great ,...When I got it it was a Shower Gel (that's why the price was so good),I called the store and they said that it was written S/G (how will I know this means Shower Gel if they had a picture of the perfume on the side???) I was very disappointed about it,and I called them to return my money and they said that I have to mail the wrong product back and they will return it but they don't return the handling and shipment (I had no timefor that since I live in Brasiland was in the US)...Disaster! Attention when you get here!!!"
3,just ok,"ordered these sunglasses and they came on time and were of good quality.I have to agree w/other reviews i have seen, they DO run small and did not fit my face/head very well.I gave them to someone w/smaller head/face...if youre an average size male...these will probably be too small."
2,Bad Customer Service,"Jura-Capresso 13214 Impressa Z5 Automatic Coffee CenterWhen it works, the machines makes great coffee. When it does not, you are in for a load of trouble because the manuals are unhelpful, and customer service is a joke. For those of you that think that spending $3,000 - 4,000 on a coffee machine might entitle you to some degree of service, Jura-Capresso will remove the veils from your eyes. The telephone service is slow and closes unexpectedly, and the e-mail and voice-mail options are a joke since the company never responds."
2,absolutely terrible customer service,"If you buy this machine, hope and pray you don't get a defective unit. We have had ours for over a month, and the machine had been down for 12 days out of that period. Not only does customer service seem disorganized (they lost our paperwork), each time we called we were on hold for at least 15 minutes waiting to speak to someone. We are still awaiting resolution on our brand new broken machine, and I have had to prod them along the whole way.Bottom line, the machine itself is great and produces an excellent coffee drink, however for the amount they're asking for a machine like this, support should be much more accommodating."
2,Not hot enough,"We have had the Z5 for a couple of weeks. The Z5 heats the milk to deliver it at about 115 degrees (F) to the cup, at the ""high"" temperature setting. If you look at the various sites on lattes, etc., they say that 150 to 160 degrees is the norm. One solution is to get the milk going with the little milk/steam lever in normal position, but then, during the milk cycle, move the lever over to ""steam only"" and insert the bottom of the steam delivery nozzle into the cup. This forces the steam into the milk (like a normal espresso machine process) and moves the needle on the thermometer quickly to 150.The downside of this is the inconvenience and cleanup. This design is not well thought-out, particularly for a machine at this price. Coffee is supposed to be hot."
2,"Bad, expensive service","You would think after paying this much money for a coffee center, one would be able to write with pride about good service from the manufacturer. Unfortunately, this is not the case. A simple hinge stopped working on one of the doors, and the Jura-Carpesso people want $300 to fix it! I had been a long time customer of this company and had purchased two other units in the past. They too often break after a short time and repairs are outlandishly expensive.I'd look elsewhere in the future"
5,Great machine,"This is in fact a very good coffee machine, so far has met all expectations in the household and we have yet to find something to complain about. Easy to learn how to use and quick to perform any type of coffee. I think it makes the BEST CAPPUCCINO, better than even some restaurants. We are very pleased with the purchase, a bit pricey, but definitely worth every penny."
1,Don't waste the money,"Having had an amazing cup of coffee at a neighbors house (made by a Z5), I was sold. Two weeks later, our Starbucks solution had arrived. As mentioned by other reviewers, the coffee, lattes, caps, etc... were excellent and the machine performed as advertised. In fact, we had regular visits by our neighbors, just for the coffee.But please be warned that these machines do not last and will require major repairs after the warranty has lapsed. Both my machine and that of my neighbors have stopped working, displaying ""error 8"" and refusing to do anything other than take up space on the kitchen counter. I realize that things aren't made like they used to be, but for $3,000+ I expect a heck of a lot more than one year's worth of light use. While lacking some of the features of the Z5, there are plenty of ""super automatics"" that are far more reliable and much cheaper. Don't bother with this machine."
2,Beware young readers,"My first grade daughter selected this book at school this week. Luckily I picked it up and read it quickly before I turned in for the night before she had a chance to start it. Although the writing is well done, the topic is definitely for the older reader. The book is very detailed about the boy finding the dog dead, and wanders on at length about the increasing guilt he is feeling, teasing from his friends and flat out scorn from a substitute teacher. What the book does right is venture to challenge kids to do any job their best, but the graphic nature of the topic and deep emotions resulting could confuse and upset a younger reader."
2,Bad,"To short. Not happy. Makes no sense, I really did not like this book. I thought it was biased and predictable."
5,Serious Yet Funny!,"Don't be fooled by the cover. If you judge this book by its cover, you may think you're in for a silly good time. And, although there are funny parts, this book deals with some heavy issues. I read it to my six year old, and she really enjoyed it, however, there was a lot of discussion along the way. Themes covered include responsibility, guilt, death, and friendship. There's nothing about snooping in the teacher's closet here."
3,This a good book.,I like the book very much. You should read it.Marvin gets to watch his teachers dog Waldo while she is on a trip.Marvins friends ask him lots of questions. It is a verry good book.by Kelton
4,Great Product for the price,"I purchased this card to use in my old butt iPAQ 2210. It was simple to install the software, and works great. It's not as fast as some other products, but for what I use mine for it's works out great."
3,Pet shop toy,"My 5 year old received this toy for Christmas. He's a big fan of this line and was very happy to receive it. However, he had trouble opening the door to the carrier. Quite frustrating for him, so he asked to have the door removed (easy to do). Not horrible, but, now we have to make sure the puppy doesn't fall out of the carrier! Still, a cute toy. He uses the puppy outside of the carrier for imagination play anyway."
5,Perfect,Exactly what I was looking for at a reasonable price. It's wonderful when it's so easy to find something that you need.
5,We all have a lot to learn..............,"If you need a reference book about raising children with a positive self-image, then this book is a must read. On or off the playing field the values are the same. I've been involved in athletics for nealy 30 years, as a mother, coach, participant, and as as athletic director at a local Community college. I have witnessed poor behavior by all involved. This wonderfully written book will help get you through even the most trying times. It has incrediable advice, wonderful suggestions, and is wriiten from the heart. My experiences in sports has help to mold my life and the advise in this book will help mold yours...A MUST-Read for parents, coaches, teachers, and participants of all ages."
2,negative to coaches,I noticed that most references to coaches were in a negative way and I stopped reading the book after page 120. While I agree with alot of what was said I felt it was to anti-coach.
5,Zinsser Never Fails,"William Zinsser's books on writing never fail to inspire me and help me sharpen my prose. He is always encouraging and down-to-earth. In this book he teaches by example, sharing short memoirs and analyzing them. Enjoyable reading, even if its just for the stories."
3,He wrote about his,"He wrote about his life in what I thought were kind of flat prose and offered a few practical suggestions for the reader, potential writer.I always enjoy suggestions from an accomplished writer but this book, I'd rather read his ""On Writing Well"" or pick up a good novel."
2,Won't Learn Much From Reading This,"This book is a bunch of introspection. While he may be telling some interesting stories, the book will not teach you how to write a memoir or anything else for that matter. I have three master's degrees and a BA in English. Getting none of those degrees taught me to write. You learn to write from imitating good writing. If you want to be a writer, then read good writing of the type you'd like to write. I've found a few of technique books to be useful: The First Five Pages, Technique in Fiction, and Self-Editing for Fiction writers. Reading while writing helps a great deal. And reading as a writer helps. Also, developing control over sentence structure is a must, along with your imagination and mature insights."
3,Generally useful,"William Zinsser has been a good guide for writers for the past several decades. This book is about writing memoir. I have never written one and am trying to learn how. WRITING ABOUT YOUR LIFE is encouraging and useful in a general way, but I have read others that are much more practical, hands-on and directive-which meets my particular needs at the moment. BTW I found it on Amazon, but was able to order a used copy in good condition at a fraction of the price of a brand-new one."
5,very nice.,"push aside the fact that theyv got like 5 songs playn on the radio, if you listen to the whole album, im 98% sure you'll like it. but if you're more into rock than alternative, this might not be for you. its pretty much an all-around alternative/some pop cd. but i still like it, its got these catchy tunes and nice ballads--i put it on mostly when im goin to sleep cos its such easy-listening."
4,Pop music?,"As this album opens, you find that these are not your average alternative rockers. This is high quality music! Granted the opening of the album is not the greatest, but it gest better. Jenkins and the crew find themselves talking their friends out of jumping off ledges (""Jumper""), they ask for something better (""Semi-Charmed Life""), and they DON""T want to do to London! (""London"") And of course they have girl troubles (""Motorcycle Drive-by""). All of the songs are crafted and truthful about how life truly is, the harsh and the good. Reality is the meal of the day, and it is served gourmet style here. With rowdy guitars, and anti-socal lyrics, this is one that diserves all the credit it can get. From the massive volume of ""Graduate"" to the quiet angst of ""Motorcycle Drive-by"" this album is excillent. My personal fav from this is ""Motorcycle Drive-by"" one of the acoustic tracks near the end. It's one of my favorite songs. Buy this one!"
4,Strong Debut,"This was a fairly good CD. I bought this a year and a half ago, and I still listen to it occasionally. Some of the songs are dull and boring, but there are a lot of good ones. ""Semi-Charmed Life,"" ""Jumper,"" and ""Thanks A Lot"" topping my list of favorite songs. Since I haven't really listened to the CD enough to really appreciate it, I can't tell you what songs I didn't like. I recommend Matchbox 20 and The Goo Goo Dolls. They sound similar in style, voice, and music,"
3,I really don't know how many stars to give it.,"I really don't know how good this cd is, so I don't know how many stars to give it. But I still own this cd, don't get me wrong, and I probably will come back later on, sometime, and write a sure review, but for now, all I can say is that The Background is my favorite song of all time."
5,Great from beginning to end.,"Haven't gotten tired of this CD yet and I've had it for 1 yr. Beautiful lyrics, some songs are fun , Stephen has great style ."
5,Awesome! Simply Awesome!,I got this cd last summer becauseI loved Semi-Charmed Life. But There were some awsome songs on it. Narcolepsy is the best.
5,One of the best CD's I own,"I got this CD for the songs,""How's it going to be"", ""Semi-charmed life"", and ""Jumper"". When I got home and listened to the whole thing, I was surprised. This band can really capture all emotions and feelings and problems in todays world, from the druggie lyrics of Semi-charmed life and the suicidal ones of Jumper to the soft sounds of I want you. The band is great and I can't wait until they release a new album. If you like Lit, Semisonic, or rock and alternative music, you'll love this CD just as much as I do. It has a great sound that you'll want to keep hearing over and over again."
5,I LOVE 3EB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I LOVE 3EB, MY FAV SONGS ARE THANX ALOT,BURNING MAN,LONDON,GOOD 4 YOU,NARCALEPSY AND I WANT YOU. I MEAN ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT!!!!!!!!!! BUT THOSE ARE MY FAVORITES. THEIR MUSIC IS SO EXCITING AND THEY MAKE YOU THINK OF ALOT THINGS THAT RELATE TOTALLY TO YOU. LIKE HOWS IT GONNA BE, I COULD CRY WHEN I HEAR THAT SONG, IT HAS SO MUCH MEANING TO ME, I TRY NOT TO LISTEN TO THAT ONE. WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE CD, YOU SHOULD YOU WOULD BE MISSING OUT ON A GREAT CD."
1,"neo-whinyboy rock -- please, jump off that ledge my friend!","This CD is awful. Another whiny band who is popular, but can't even write a decent pop song. Is that alternative? Alternative to what? At least Celine Dion can sing, whether you like her or not!Musically, this band isn't half-bad, but their singer can't sing, their lyrics are tepid, and the songs themselves are repetitive. just say no!"
3,3eb has yet to graduate..,"I must admit that when I first bought this disc I expected more. On the first go, I didn't really like the disc, besides ""Semi-Charmed Life"" and ""Narcolepsy"". But I listened to it a few more times,and was surprised. I found out more great songs: besides the upbeat, happy semi charmed, there's soft songs like narcolepsy and losing a whole year, and also you must check out ""how's it gonna be"", ""london"", ""graduate"", and of course (!), ""burning man""."
2,chizcake,"Yes, they have a catchy tune. And the band has recieved tremendous reviews here in amazon (also some wretched). However, the disk tends to wear out after 3 playings. If you want to hear it I reccomend you borrow it."
1,Uninspired noise,"This band hooked a lot of music buyers with ""Semi-Charmed Life"" and ""How's It Gonna Be"". Unfortunately, this record has no other redeeming qualities. It is a ""let's see how loud we can play"" mess. Tape the aforementioned two songs off the radio and save your cash. This band is a flash in the pan with a disappointing debut."
1,So this is what radio is coming to.,"I'm sure this is a great album, that is, if you're the kind of person who thinks modern rock radio is great and Jim Breuer is funny, in other words, HAS NO TASTE. It just gets me really pissed off that radio can generally ignore incredible bands like Radiohead and Blur, and overplay junk like this and Matchbox 20. Go do yourself a favor and buy ""OK Computer"" if you want to hear good music. If you want commercial ""alternative"" pop music from people who can't play their instruments or write a mildly intelligent lyric, 3rd Eye Blind is for you. Go ahead and mail me if you want."
2,Pretty Bad stuff,I bought this cd because i liked semi charmed life and Jumper..ill admit that they are good songs...but the rest is just annoying noise that i cant stand to listen..dont buy it!
3,"It's okay. . .just ""okay""","This is by no means a classic. Don't think of it that way. This is your typical mid-to-late 90's ""conservative, alternative"" music. The only standout song on this album is ""Jumper;"" it compares to R. E. M.'s ""Everybody Hurts"" in it's message and quality. This may by typical new rock, but it's at least it's well-done typical new rock. Don't expect to hear anything new or revolutionary from 3eb."
5,Awsome,This is the best CD I've ever listened to! Every song is great. I can't wait for their next album to be released!
5,One of my favorite cd's,I love this cd. It has a total variety of differnt kinds of songs. It has something for everyone.
5,I have two words for you that tell about this CD:,"THE BOMB. This is one of those albums that you don't have to have a CD of to listen to it. Because all of the songs are good, and you don't have to skip to any particular one."
5,Simply incredible music,"I bought this album back in the late 90s like everyone else. I was 12 years old when I first heard ""Semi-charmed Life"" on MTV. Like most I simply heard an incredibly poppy hook and was drawn in. All these years later I still listen to this album on a monthly basis. It's a shame this band's time in the lime-light was so short lived. Especially since their last release (2003's Out of the Vein) was so phenomenal. But this is the band's origin and also their most triumphant achievement. The songs are literally oozing with artistry and profound lyricism. Even the much lesser known tracks (Burning Man, The Background) would be top-notch tracks on a lesser bands album. Ironically, the singles shine the brightest here. Jenkins' manages to capture genuine (and humanisticly mundane) emotion. Songs like ""Jumper"" and ""How's it Gonna Be"" contain verses of profound emotion that swell into anthems of the late 90s generation. They don't make 'em like they used to. Here's the proof."
4,Good overall,"A good album overall. A few of the songs are a little shouty, but there are far more hits than misses here. Jumper, Burning Man and I Want You are excellent and most of the others are good. I don't regret purchasing it at all."
5,Absolutely outstanding,"This album is just awesome. The best CD I personally have ever listened to. The songs are just great...the music just gets you going and the lyrics are very creative and meaningful. I can't believe how many reviews I have seen that overlook the last three songs...don't get me wrong, their faster stuff is great, but the slower songs are just as good...if not better. ""The God of Wine"" has got to be one of my all time favorites. Also, if you ever get the chance to see 3EB in concert, do it. The best concert I have ever been to. These guys are just pure talent. Great stuff."
5,Buy it,"This album is easy to listen to from start to finish. Really every song is notable. There isn't much to say about this, besides the fact that if you like this genre of album you'll love this album. It's exceptionally well done and deservedly put TEB on the map."
5,A Great Album,"Basically every song on here is worth 5 stars except in my opinion, thanks a lot (track 7). Just thought it was bit dull maybe id give it 3/5 as a song.the first track, 'losing a whole year' sets it up. Straight away you can tell with the lyrics and the great guitar work that this will be a great album. Semi charmed life has been over played which isnt surprising as its the best pop rock tune of any summer. Skimming along the other tracks you get great fast and slow songs, with the brilliant slightly wierd song 'burning man' to the brilliant three songs at the end.You could split this Cd into two albums, charge double and its still worth it. Its my third favourite album ever and obviously the best third eye blind album to date."
3,one or two good songs but....,"ive had this cd for two or three years now and have listened to it many times, but hows it gonna be and semi charmed life are the only two that managed to float my boat. The rest, were lets face it, quite crap. If they had only put few more good songs on their, than this would have been a worthy album. I agree with the guy above. Listen to radiohead the bends and ok computer."
2,A review from Mr. Entertainment Lover,This album has only a couple of good tracks on it that save it from a one star rating. Most of the songs feel like they have no emotion to them. Still there are a lot worse musicians.
2,"Okay, but not great","Although there are a few good songs like ""London"" and ""How's It Gonna Be"", most were not that strong. Most songs were weak on lyrics and music, but it did contain ""Semi-charmed Life"" in its entirity, which is never played on the radio."
2,great at first,"This CD is great the first few times you listen to it, but after a while, it just gets really boring. The songs are over predictable and get old real fast. Borrow this CD from a friend but don't buy it."
1,An insidious piece of work that should have been suppressed.,"As an avid music fan and first amendment enthusiast, I try my best to be understanding of styles of music that I am unaccustomed to. However, Third Eye Blind is desperately trying to push the envelope here; how many insufferable lyrics must we listen to before we crack? How many generic songs, all blending together until there is only ""How's It Gonna Be When I Graduate And Get A Semi-Charmed Life"", must we tolerate, clogging our airwaves? Where, may I ask, are the bands with musical innovation? Where is the poetry? Does anyone really still like the song after they know the words to Semi-Charmed Life? I was embarrassed for Stephen Jenkins. Boys, put your past away, and get nice office jobs. There is nothing that can save this record aside from the ever-cleansing flame."
1,Depressing Nonsense,"There is nothing Semi-Charming about it. The band that started the 98-99 bad music era. 'Jumper' makes me want to commit suicide. Just some more lame High School popular music. However, if you are a ""DoAnythingToBePopularAndCool"" kind of person then buy this album immediatly along with a complete wardrobe by Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap, and Eddie Bower. But for those who like beautiful vocals, melodies, and moods, stay the hell away from this album and have faith for better music in the future."
1,How come this CD has a four and a half star rating???,"It should have a NO star rating, it is complete SH*T! Why would a band like this become mainstream and popular? What can I say, the masses are usually morons."
2,Excited by singles. Sadly underwhelmed by CD.,"I heard 3EB in concert, and was psyched to own their self-titled CD. When I finally got it, my excitement deflated like a punctured balloon.After you've heard ""Semi-Charmed Life"" and ""Jumper"", you've pretty much heard the whole CD. Just about every song sounds the same. Not a bad song, but it's just ten or so versions of it.The one exception is ""Motorcyle Drive-By"". I fell in love with that track. Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to justify the CD, in my mind."
1,Terrible,I bought this cd for semicharmed life and jumper but afterlistening to the whole cd i cant believe i wasted 14 bucks on thispiece of plastic junk. this cd s**ks. they have no idea what music is and i hope that anyone that appreciates music doesnt buy this but if you are one of those people who does something cause other people do take a trip to abercrombie and get yourself this cd.
1,In a phrase: Formula Band,"This band sounds just like all the others in the same vein: Matchbox 20, Semisonic, Fuel, Goo Goo Dolls, Sister Hazel, and even Oasis. Unfortunately, all have become the darlings of commercial, self-proclaimed ""alternative"" (if there is any definition for the moniker now) radio stations all over the country, and lack any truly distinctive sound. Every song sounds the same. I ended up returning this CD to the store. It almost ended up like the Matchbox 20 CD I bought - smashed to bits."
1,It can't get any worse than this!,"I went out and bought this cd and found $15 of my money totally wasted. What this cd needs is musicality and not someone who can't sing and desperately needs singing lessons screaming in my ear. Since the music (I shouldn't say music I should say trash) disapointed me I read the lyrics thinking maybe I would find some meaning. The lyrics were totally average and dull. I am not one to complain but this is the worse cd I have ever heard in my entire life!!! As a fellow musician I see this as a disgrace to the industry. In my opinion, either save your money or buy a good rock cd like Bush, Sublime, or Matchbox 20."
1,STOP THE ABUSE!!!,"This album made my ears bleed. I'd like to chop off the lead singer's head and display it on a stick in my backyard.I think I'd gain more friends that way than making a banal, bland, redundant album like third eye blind.To keep the future generation out of harms way, I hope to god that they never make another album. May god have pity on their souls."
3,Skip the Middle,"I've had this album for several years now since first hearing it when it was playing in some record store I was browsing along the Outer Banks in North Carolina. As I put it on the stack of CDs to be offered in a moving sale, I realize my first impression has never changed -- sometimes drink makes you brilliant...and sometimes it doesn't. Judging by the lyrics, Third Eye's done a lot of drinking and, again going by the lyrics, it's been both the cause and the outcome of serious heartache. The music blasts and rages and then crashes into quiet pain, kind of a musical aftermath or hangover. The result is high drama, often skittering into histrionic melodrama, but overall this is not a bad trip -- for about eight cuts of the 14. Keep the first six and the last three, dump the rest. Play Motorcycle Drive By over and over again, but finally decide that excess works no better in music than in life or drink."
2,Catchy at first....but,"For about a week I thought this was a great CD. The problem is that you get sick of it very quickly, and the radio playing songs off it didn't help much. Granted, there are a couple songs I still like (Narcolepsy, How's it gonna be)but most of it just digusts me now (especially Semi-charmed kinda life and Jumper) Anyway, if you just love catchy songs and never get sick of anything, you'll love it forever, otherwise, jus borrow it for a week."
1,I wish I could give this no stars.,This is by far the biggest waste of money ever. Third Eye Blind is another sell-out in the long list of the late 90's. They arn't uninqe at all. They play with no edge.
3,Very good first effort.,"I love ""How's It Gonna Be"". It's great song to sing along with at a bar. This album is full of catchy songs that make for enjoyable listening. Not a classic by any stretch but it's alot better than some of the screaming and wailing out there. Some of the songs have stupid lyrics, but so do most songs these days anyway."
4,Keep the trash to yourself,"There are a many gems on this CD, and while I think that with enough play, they will become repetitve, I respect the fact that others like it. If you don't like it, tell me, but don't call me a drone or just another teen stuck in the rut of popularity. I like this CD because the songs are good, not because my friend told me to like it. Get a life trash talkers, voice your opinion on the CD, not its listeners."
5,so what if he CAN'T sing?,"My god people.....if you really knew what it was about. Stephan himself has said it, that he can't sing(watch the Bammies). Rock isn't about how beautiful your voice sounds, it's what your expressing with your vocal chords....the fact that he's doing that, and so many other's are chicken sh*t to is pretty damn amazing."
5,Whoa,"When I first listened to this album, I was amazed. Then I listened more, and I was stunned. This simply gets better each and every time you listen to it. Remember, when you first get this CD, don't only listen to the singles. Every song is a best song, so have an open mind."
5,IS THIS BAND GOD OR WHAT?,"Third Eye Blind= THE BEST F'N BAND IN THE WORLD! Kevin Cadogan, Stephan Jenkins, Brad Hargreas, and Arion Salazar rock this world. I go to every concert of theirs I can because they kick @ss! Everyone must bow to them becuase they are just so awesome. Who else can play guitar like Kevin? eh? Not a soul! Who can rock out on bass like Arion? Nobody. Who can play that jungle beat like Brad? Not one person. And who can sing, liven the crowd, and write wicked cool lyrics like Stephan? Not I...that's for damn sure! Everyone get Blue! That album will so rock! ""Anything"" rules!"
5,every song was written well,this cd is one of my all time favorites. every single song is a masterpiece!
5,One of the best cds of all time,"I think this is 3eb's best cd. All of there songs are excellent but this is the collection of their best.The songs off this cd that are heard of the radio are good, no doubt, but the best songs on this are the ones no one's heard of unless you own the cd.Check out losing a whole year, thanks a lot, good for you, motorcycle drive by, and god of wine for some of the best music you've ever heard."
5,One of the best rock records ever!,"This CD just doesn't get old. It is solid from start to finish. I have have been listening to this CD since it came out, and still can't believe these guys aren't the biggest rock band in the world.I like almost every track on the record, but the last three songs are the best by far. And this is even more surprising since none of them have ever been played on the radio. They all have excellent lyrics, and just sound great.I seriously doubt that anyone will by this CD based on my recommendation, but I had to give 3EB the credit they deserve."
4,Awesome,"Easily one of the best debut cd's ever released. This cd hold's wonder's such as ""jumper"" and ""how's it gonna be"", but some of the best songs on the cd were not the huge hits but the songs that describe emotion and have outstanding guitar solos and beautiful lyrics. Third Eye Blind has gained a reputation for some classic songs and the great guitars heard throughout the whole cd. This is easily one of the best cd's i have ever owned/purchased. I also own their newest cd Blue, it has more of a melodious and relaxed sound where this cd is just pure alternative/rock. This cd is a masterpiece that if you don't own you should and this cd. I strongly reccomend it to any alternative/rock fans or any people who like Tonic, Splender, or the Goo Goo Dolls. Buy this one!"
4,"Very good overall. Four songs, in particular, outstanding !","Buy it for the radio hits (""Semi-Charmed Life,"" ""Jumper"" - two excellent tracks), but don't over look the rest of the album. Overall, this is a very good CD from top to bottom. As it turns out, my two favorite songs aren't the hit tracks, but rather the last two tracks: ""Motorcycle Drive By"" and ""God of Wine."" This two tracks alone make this CD a worthwhile purchase."
5,All these reviews are too long...,"...but the CD warrants it. I can say that, without a doubt, this is the best overall CD I have ever heard. Not a single track, NOT ONE, is disappointing. Every song is memorable to the last, and the inspired lyrics flow well with the catchy refrains. Buy it. If you don't like it, you can come to my house and kick my ass. Promise."
4,Great album.....,"The singer and the guitar create a very mellow, soothing sound, yet it also (pop)rocks out at the same time. The lyrics are refreshing, but the only problem is that this album dies out after the 8th track. There are some really strong songs after the 8th track, but the songs are put in an order that does not propel the album to the finish. It seems as though the popular (radio-friendly) songs are found at the beginning of the album and everything afterwards fizzles out. The songs towards the end need more support from the songs that surround it, so as to make them more effective.This album would be stronger if the songs were played in this order: 2,11,4,8,7,3,5,6,10,12,1,9, and 14. Track 13 (Motorcycle Drive By) is the worst song on this album and should be omitted because it sounds like a cheap b-side. This album would have fared better if the songs were in better order. The album is still worth buying just shuffle it your own way."
4,I thought it was a little better than okay.,I really liked their two songs titled semi-charmed life and How's it going to be. Those two were awesome but most of the other songs were either boring or just okay. The overall music of the cd was good but some songs I thoght held it down. The reason I like those two songs were because they had good guitar playing and vocals. They have a lot of other good somes like the 5th song on the CD(I don't know it's name).
5,Best Cd Ever,"I would give this cd at least 10 stars, but I could only give five. In short this is the best Damn cd I have ever heard."
5,"How could The Moffatts get 5, and 3rd Eye Blind only 4 1/2?",I hate the Moffats. I gave them a 1 star review because they had 5 stars! No one gave them lower than 4 stars. Please give The Moffatts the bad reviews they deserve. Third Eye Blind rocks. They have got the hard beat an album needs. Give them the high reviews they deserve.
5,3rd Eye Blind- the best CD I own,"I am a your typical music lover- listening to all the hits and stuff. For Christmas, I usually ask for CDs and junk. Well, old St. Nick brought me 3rd Eye Blind. Now, I was thinking ""geez, how crappy is this going to be?"".. And I didn't open it till a month later because I finally decided to give it a shot. I listened to the WHOLE album in one shot- and I swear on my life I knew all the words to every song on that CD because it was sooooo great! If you get it, turn it to Track 2, 2:25 exactly and you'll feel the guitars vibrating the floor.. It's AWESOME! Please buy it because I guarantee anyone would like at least 2 songs from this great CD."
2,Could be better . . .,"Some songs on here are great, but overall all of them pretty much sound the same. You may think that you like their songs but don't get this cd. You'll be really dissapointed."
3,Just listen to it a few times ...,"""Semi-Charmed Life"", ""How's it Going to be"" and ""Jumper"" are great songs to start with this CD, but other tracks, particularly ""Motorcycle Drive By"" and ""Burning Man"" did grew into me and caught up later. Some good lyrics, such as ""Losing a Whole Year"", ""Thanks a Lot"" and ""Graduate"", sound dislocated from the unnerving music. This is a +/- CD, you can't be happy with ALL of it, you may even find it tossed aside and forget it existed for weeks. Overall, an average feat."
3,solid cd,"This cd is a solid debut for Third eye blind, it has the obvious hits like ""semi-charmed life"", ""how's it going to be"", and ""losing a whole year."" But there are some hidden gems that should be getting more playing time on the radio. For example, ""jumper"", ""I want you"", and ""the background."" The cd is pretty good, there are some dry spots but overall it's a cd worth listening to."
1,THEY SUCK!,"Dear lord.....When will the American public come to from there coma. This CD is as s-wordy as it is trendy. These guyz think that there all cool because they can cuss, and have ""rude"" lyrics. Give me a break. Cussing doesn't make you cool and neither does rude lyrics its just basically bullshi*. If you want some good music with a REAL attitude try punk rock. Like THE OFFSPRING, NOFX, GUTTERMOUTH, PENNYWISE, VANDALS and THE MISFITS. You will get a better listening experience than with this piece of shi* band."
2,Trying to be What they aren't,"Ok, first off, when I first got this CD, I have to admit that I loved it. But then it sunk in: these guys are more suited to the sounds of the wretchedly Backstreet Boy sounding ""I want you"", than anything else. Try as they might, they're attempts at rock just didn't work. They try to add thought provoking issues and lyrics, where I really don't believe they have any. Honestly, I think they belong more in the pop genre than rock, and could probably make something more of themselves. But, through it all, I have to admit that the instrumental sense of the music is more than there, and they deserve some credit for that. Also, you may as well take the musical tastes of me into account, which include deftones, slipknot, and KoRn, so, of course I am going to discount these guys as rockers. Just my opinion."
2,Eh!,"Granted, this album does have three radio hits. Of Semi-Charmed Life, How's It Going To Be, & Jumper, SCL is the only one that hasn't gotten on my nerves. The rest of the album is really not that good. I used to like 3EB, and I once considered this album to be very good. I then discovered other great bands, such as Radiohead, the Beatles, & U2. If you listen to pop stations on the radio, I am sure you will like this album (although, I believe some songs will be played more than other). Do yourselves a favor, though: check out Radiohead's The Bends."
2,A bad album,"I only bought this album because of the song ""Semi-Charmed Life"". Other than that, all the other songs except for ""London"" are all bad."
2,It all went wrong...,"This could have been a great album. They could have simply released it to moderate radio airplay. But nooooo, we have to be subjected to 2 years of constant 3eb. Then we buy the album, and realize we are already sick as hell of the first six songs, and all the rest are horrible to start with. What a tragedy."
1,Horrendous,"Can I graduate? No you may not. This album receives failing grades from start to finish. It is filled with childish, thoughtless, weak pop songs. Disgraceful."
5,Beautiful,Why can't we be blessed with amazing rock albums like this one anymore? This album is one of the best modern rock albums of the 90's I listen to it all the way through every time i put it in. It just makes me feel so damn good
5,AMAZING,"I absolutely LOVE this album. No doubt about it. I bought it for the big hits, ""Jumper,"" ""Semi-Charmed Life,"" ""Graduate,"" ""How's It Gonna Be."" And so for a while I was content listening to just those songs. After listening to the whole thing all the through a few times, though, and you begin to realize just how brilliant Third Eye Blind really is. The songs that they had on the radio for that album were just barely scraping the surface of the raw, edgy talent beneath. I know all the words to every single song now, and don't even listen to the hits anymore - I listen to the album because I want to hear the other songs. It's a great blend of touching love songs and bass-pounding angst to suit anyone's likes. I love this album beyond belief, and recommend it above any other."
5,Every song is good,"I bought the CD because I thought I'd like a couple of songs, like most albums have. But I was very pleasantly surprised. Every song had a good rhythm, strong lyrics and sound. Very enjoyable. I listen to the CD often and never get tired of it. Trust me. You'll like it if you like alternative rock."
4,"Great songs, great band, great everything!","WHOO! a truly great CD, i was a tad leery to buy it at first since i knew that Semi-Charmed Life was about drugs, but now i'm really glad i did! it's wonderful! i recommend it tremendously."
5,Classic,"This CD has now been out for 4 years and I still haven't gotten sick of listening to it.This is one of those CD's that I can listen to and won't skip one track.Each song is briliantly written and sung very well.The songs are very original,you can tell that they aren't trying to be like other artists.This is an excelent CD by an excelent group.If you have not yet gotten this CD I say you go out and get it.It is worth every cent."
5,Essential,"Despite the 5 singles on this release, enough to make the most devout fan shout ""sellout""...this is one of the best pop albums of the 90s. Pure unadulterated emotion, sexual tension and sporadic drug experimentation packed into tight little ditties. Jenkins stands high on the list of songwriters like Trent Reznor, Matt Johnson and Paul Westerberg who understand that their loss is the listener's gain. Two songs that the crummy radio station in your area never heard are ""God of Wine"" and ""The Background""...give them a listen and you will wonder why you let your radio station convince you that ""Semi-Charmed Life"" was the only good song on the CD. Special note...the bass laid down in this album secretly makes up a huge part of the impact of this release---EADG never sounded better. Trust me on this one."
5,The CD Kicks Butt!,"This Is a great CD. All the songs are great, the band rocks, and Semi-Charmed Life, Jumper, Graduate, and How's It Gonna Be are the best songs in the world"
5,They should win an award for this album,"WOW!! Usually when I buy a CD for one song it's the only good one, seems the rest of the songs suck. Not even close with Third Eye Blind! I liked Semi-Charmed Life and that was why I bought it and I was happy to find I liked the entire CD. Seems with these guys they only get better and better. This CD should really get 6 stars!"
5,BUY IT BUY IT!!!!!,"This is SUCH a good CD. I TOTALLY recommend it! All the songs are great, so BUY IT!"
5,third eye blind RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THEY RULE THIRD EYE BLIND IS MY FAVORITE BAND ESPECILLY SEMI-CHARMED TIME OF LIFE AND JUMPER THE WORDS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THE MUSIC ITS COOL THEY HAVE REALLY ROCKY SONGS AND SOME SOFT SONGS OF COURSE MY FAVOTITE IS SEMI CHARMED TIME OF LIFE THERE SONGS ARE ALL GOOD BUT I WISH THEY WOULD PLAY THERE SONGS ON THE RADIO MORE THEY ROCK I LIKE THE LEAD SINGER STEPHEN JENKINS THERE THE BEST BAND OUT THERE!!!!!!!!
5,This cd is great!,"Third Eye Blind is a great band. They show that with their first self - entitled cd. I first heard this at a friend's house and I thought that it was kind of cool. It isn't really hard music, but it is good! I recommend it!"
3,Not bad,"Ya know ...I know how strange this is going to sound, but from a standpoint of creativity this cd dosen't really have anything new to offer that a dozen other bands out now couldn't fill. I do realize that this is really only fluff, but man is it catchy.I'm reminded of a scene from the Matrix where Cypher is selling out Morpheus to Agents Smith staring at the steak that was given to him and saying""I know that this steak isn't really here, I know it's just the matrix telling my brain that this meat is juicy and tender. But you know what? Sometimes ignorance is bliss.""So in this case, just shut your brain off and enjoy it ..."
4,"Good first album, don't bother with Blue","This is a great first album. It may take some time to appreciate many of the songs on the CD, but as you listen to the CD, you'll begin to like it. This is an odd mix of hard rock and alternative, but it came out to be pretty good. They slipped on 2 or 3 tracks, but that's ok, it's something you can play all the way threw. If you like this CD, don't waste your time with Blue, it's. . . odd."
3,"I do enjoy this CD, but it kinda gets old.","3eb's debut album, self-titled, is a great introduction to their distinct sound, but this CD isn't better than ""Blue"". Buy ""Blue"" first. Good instruments, lousy vocals, though."
5,One of the best albums of the nineties,Definitely Gen-X material. Some of the best songs have yet to be released for air play. I'm quite impressed.
4,definately worth a listen...,"A friend of mine left this cassette in my car, and during a long road trip, I decided to give it a listen. I was skeptical at first, because I was tired of hearing ""Semi-Charmed Life"", but the album was great...particularly the lyrics, some of them really hit home..very meaningful. I think that's what I appreciated most about this album. Much of the music is upbeat and original. Though this album could have been a little more diverse, the group is obviously talented and seems to take from a variety of influences. ""Graduate"" seems to me to have a little bit of a Jane's Addiction influence. Definately worth a listen...or two...or three..as I ended up doing in my car. I'm glad for my friend's forgetfulness!"
5,Excellent CD,"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews; this is an awesome CD. I would highly recommend it to anyone. Every song on it is great. My 2 favorite ones are ""Graduate"" and ""I Want You."" But, I still like all the ones the radio stations play all of the time."
5,Sweetness,"This has got to be the best music ever. I have an extremely eclectic music collection but this is my favorite CD. ""How's It Going To Be"" ""Thanks A Lot"" ""Burning Man"" ""Motorcycle Drive By"" and especially ""God Of Wine"" are the absolute best songs on here. This is great each song is distinct and entrancing. 3EB is a great band with great music all around."
5,This album never comes out of my car cd player!,"I too, have had this album since it came out. I really liked their radio songs. But I was blown away by the other songs on the album, primarily ""Motorcycle Driveby,"" ""Background"" and ""Losing a Whole Year."" The lyrics on these songs are so fantastic--it's impossible for me to NOT sing along. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is looking for an album you can play through from start to finish, and for anyone who really appreciates the lyrical content of music. 3eb is not my favorite group but this truly is one of my all-time favorite albums. Blue was mediocre but I am really looking forward to their new release in May."
5,one of the best cd's ever,"This cd is great!My brother burt it for me and I love it.This cd has some of the best songs ever written!Songs 12,13,and14 are my favorite.God of Wine is soooo good!!Here is my ratings on the songs.1-10 10 being the best.track 1.losing a whole year 9 .track 2 Narcolepsy 10.track 3 Semi-Charmed Life 9.track 4 Jumper 9.track 5 Graduate 9.track 6 Hows it Gonna Be 9.track 7 Thanks A Lot 9. track 8 Burning Man 8.track 9 Good For You 9. track 10 London 9.track 11 I Want You 9. track 12 The Background 10.track 13 Motorcycle Drive By 10.track 14 God of Wine 10.I cant wait for there new cd to come out!!If youre smart youll buy this cd."
5,AND I THOUGHT SAVAGE GARDEN WAS GOOD!!!!!!!!,"THIRD EYE BLIND IS A CLASSIC!!I ACTUALLY THOUGHT SAVAGE GARDEN WAS AWESOME UNITL THIRD EYE BLIND CAME ALONG!! ALL THE WAY THIRD EYE BLIND.SONGS LIKE SEMI-CHARMED LIFE,JUMPER,HOWS IT GONNA BE AND LOSING A WHOLE YEAR ARE SURE TO BE GREAT HITS!!!!!"
4,A couple of great break up songs here!,"This band will put out a couple of albums and fade. That said, this is worth having. ""Losing a Whole Year"", and ""Hows it Going to Be"", are perfect break up songs. The whole effort is definitly above average."
4,Good band......Good Lyrics = Great CD,"I would have given it five but I'm getting tired of having to skip over ""I want you"". It's the only song i don't like on the CD."
5,the best cd out there,"not to short, not too long, not too heavy, not too light, a perfect sit-back-and-relax cd that jives with whatever you plan on doing. I hope 3eb releases another, because i will buy it the second it hits the shelves."
4,"""I wud never let it go""","Have I ever been so desperate for a CD?My romance with 3eb started with ""Motorcycle Drive By"" and 6 months after i first listened to them, it has yet to reach its crescendo.A very informative DJ at a local pub was playing 3eb, needless to say the 3-4 songs he played left an indelible imprint on my mind. Since then i have tried laying my hands on the CD ( after being able to only partially download these songs from the net). I have been extremely desperate ever since as neither the Local shops/Music retail Chains nor the etailers in India seem to be having it.But today i feel immensely relieved. The stuff is finally available at amazon. Finally!!3eb's music is intense,lively, smooth. Believe me, its very PURE ,PERTINENT & DIFFERENT. Rarely has a 90s pop-rock/alternative band shown this kinda maturity whilst dolling out such well crafted lyrics.Listen to ""Motorccle Drive By""; ""Semi-Charmed Life"";""Deep Inside of you"";""Never Let u Go"" and you would know what i mean....."
4,"Catchy stuff, good as Blue","The songs on 3EB's first are catchy and radio-friendly. Thankfully, they have more depth than the Backstreet Boys. ""Semi-Charmed Life"" gets on your nerves after a while (blame the ""do do do"" thing) but most of the other songs stay in your head for weeks without driving you nuts. My top picks: ""Narcolepsy"", ""I Want You"", and ""God of Wine""."
3,Surprisingly good,"At first, I had a bad attitude toward this band... I still don't see how a band could get so popular from ""Semi-charmed Life"" and ""How's it Gonna Be?"". I am a musician and I'm generally very biased against ""radio music"". When I finally got around to hearing this whole CD, I was shocked at how good this stuff is. This is the ultimate party CD. Just put it on and get buck wild! ""Narcolepsy"", ""Good for You"", and ""Thanks A Lot"" are all really great tracks. Don't be turned off by their over-exposure.. this band rocks!"
3,Definately Interesting,"I like the music and I like the interesting way Stephen Jenkins puts his voice talents to use, but they could do with some better lyrics. To be honest, I threw away the little cover bookie... it was repulsing. Also, some of the songs were a little bit head-bangy, if you know what I mean. There are some gems with decent lyrics(Jumper and How's It Going To Be), but on the whole.... :-(."
5,Best CD I own,"OK, you're out there saying, hmm, should I get this 3eb CD, its kinda too popular for me, all their songs on the radio are old. Don't think about it one more second. This is the greatest CD I have, in my 175 CD collection. I am on my 3rd copy already, cause I wore the grooves out on the first 2. How this CD didn't get 5 stars from the powers that be on amazon.com is beyond me. There is not one song on here that is even OK, buy this CD and see how music was meant to be played."
5,A CD For Your Auto Changer !,"This Album takes pride of place in my Car CD Changer. Each time I listen to it I get something more out of it! There can't be many albums that stand up to that ! Ok, it may be Technically very simple but hey it don't half sound good !"
3,"Average CD, not great, not bad","I loved Semi-Charmed Life and Jumper, and thought the rest of the CD would be as good - which was hardly the case. How's It Gonna Be is also great, but man, the rest of this disc blows. The songs are boring and have few hooks or memorable lyrics. The arrangement in all the songs (except for the afore mentioned) seem to be the same - they start out somewhat tolerable, then sort of get lost somewhere in the middle and lose the initial good sound.What 3EB should do is get a lesson from Smash Mouth and their Astro Lounge CD, where the musical arrangements are superb and interesting."
1,"Wretchedness, damn wretchedness, and pop songs","It's a pretty simple equasion: Every decade there are a certain number of talentless bands that manage to write one or two catchy but vapid songs and end up stars for about five minutes. In the Sixties, there were Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five; in the Seventies, Grand Funk Railroad and Manfred Mann's Earth Band; the Eighties had Flock of Seagulls and Men at Work; Third Eye Blind is right at the top of that wretched pile for this decade. Unfortunately, these boys are not even saved by the goofy humor of most of those bands--they've listened to their Counting Crows and glommed all the wrong parts of the equasion. Don't venture within miles of this album"
2,compare to macaroni,"While Third Eye Blind exists on a plane above such modern ""rock"" disasters as Slipknot or Limp Bizkit, they aren't too high up either. They're listenable, sure- I can definitely listen to pretty much any song here (they're all alike) without wanting to throw my cd player out the window.But its not interesting, intelligent, new, or even remotely good. This kind of Matchbox20/GooGooDolls/FMLiteAlternative/easymacmusic is not what the airwaves need (we can only hope that things change...)Compare this record to microwaveable macaroni. Its easy to make, and its cheesy and edible. But its no steak tartare or fillet mignon. Look elsewhere for such delicacies."
3,"3EB, ""Thanks A Lot"".","Unfortunately, these guys have suffered the same fate as many others, like ""Sugar Ray"". They got huge right away with their debut, then with each release people kind of lost interest. Well, regardless of all that, this is a great disc. I've heard a few make comparisons to ""Pink Floyd"" and ""Jane's Addiction"", and while 3EB is nowhere near the caliber of those bands, they're much better than say ""Matchbox Twenty"", or similar VH1 bands. Most all of these tracks are good, but the hits are ""How It's Going To Be"", ""Jumper"", ""Losing A Whole Year"", and the way overplayed to the point of being annoying ""Semi-Charmed Life"". Their next album had some good tracks like ""Never Let You Go"", but this is the disc to own. You should be able to find numerous copies at your local used cd store."
2,Blaaaa!,"This album was one of my favorite albums...until I realized it sucks! The only reason it got 2 stars is because they are trying to be good...it just doesnt work. Sorry Stephen. The songs on the CD are catchy...but they all sound exactly the same! The lyrics are a bit below mediocre, and the muscianship is ok...i gotta give 'em some props, cause they have gotten further than my band has. Stephen Jenkin's voice is what really ruins it for them. That guy cant carry a tune in a friggin' bucket! If you wanna listen to good music, with good lyrics (just good all around), listen to Tool or Radiohead. Now those are two amazing bands!"
3,It was good when I first got it..,"Ok, this is the type of album that after a couple of months will start collecting dust. I haven't listened to it in like a year now, yeah, all of 1999 I haven't listened to it, and they were one of my fave bands when they first came out. It's just that their music is played so much, I feel no need to pick up the CD. It was a good album, but it's nothing memorable. Compare it to that wallflowers CD you have stashed away somewhere in your collection. Record the CD from a friend in a tape.. It wouldn't really be worth the ten bucks it would cost. Save yourself some cash."
3,Solid Alternative Music,"This is solid alternative rock, and each song holds its own. I think they try too many styles, and they should stick with songs like ""Jumper"" and ""The Background"". I like Semi-Charmed Life, but theres so many other groups that can do songs such as ""How's It Going To Be"" much better. And also, 3eb is a horrible live band."
3,Not great rock music,"This album's only decent because of the intricate guitar playing on it and the sometimes introspective lyrics. The intricate instruments actually make the songs sound more creative than songs by bands like Matchbox 20. The style's certainly not new, though. ""Jumper"" is about as desperate a song I have heard (in lyrics, not voice.) The lead singer just can't complete ""Jumper"" or any other song with any large amount of emotion. He sounds like he's going through the motions. ""The Background,"" which has a great example of that intricate guitar playing, suits his tone of voice. But it's a little annoying to have his voice actually in the background for much of the song, though. You will do better buying an album by Nirvana or Pearl Jam."
1,ideal album for the musicially inane,"anyone who considers this trash ""alternative"" or even rock needs to go to jail.this band is merely a pathetic rip-off of Jane's Addiction,Nirvana,and a few others. if you think that this band is in some way breaking new ground in music,i feel seriously sorry for you."
1,All 3eb's Songs Sound Exactly the Same!!!!!!,Save your money for something that's woth it. All of the song are exactly the same. About half the album is singles which have way too much air play as it is. Go buy someting good with your money!
1,Whats the point of this?,"Well i guess there are a few misguided individuals out there who think this is decent, but that is most likely because they never heard any real music, and therefore are ignorant of it. To me this is horrible, but for those others...well as they say, ignorance is bliss."
5,Fully Charmed Life,"When I first heard ""Semi Charmed Life"" , the chorus just got stuck in my head. And the next single ""How's It Going to be"" just hit me just as i broke up with my girlfriend. ""In the Back Ground"" led me to realize that I still very much loved her. I wished they made a video for every single song. Stephan Jenkins has that awesome vocal style that gets you so into the song. My girlfriend Liberty and I listen and love every song on it and would definitely call it a classic."
5,"Deep, thoughtful, and a great album","There are few truly moving songs nowadays, and yet this album has 14 of them. While it mays sound like it, this review isn't blind worship of a favorite band; these are my honest opinions. The lyrics are, simply put, incredible. They are at the same time enjoyable, thoughtful, and touching in a way few songs are. They are so touching because they, as far as I can tell, are based on actual experiences. As an advertisement so precisely states, ""This is the soundtrack to your life."" I can't say it any better than that. This album, in my opinion, is truly sublime. It's very well worth the price."
4,Third Eye Blind Scores Big,"This album, which is Third Eye Blind's debut album is a wonderful rock album and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in rock and roll whatsoever. For me, there are so many highlights on this CD, and I've cut them down to this: ""Semi-Charmed Life"", ""Jumper"", ""Graduate"", ""How's it Gonna Be?"", ""London"", ""Good For You"", ""The Background"", ""Motorcycle Driveby"", and perhaps the most powerful song on the album, ""God of Wine"". Third Eye Blind has such good chemistry between the band members it seems, and Stephen Jenkins is definitely one of the biggest singers on the scene right now. Do everyone a favor 3EB, and follow Bono's advice, ""Stay close to the songs."" Rock on."
2,unoriginal and mildly amusing,"One of those books you can read fast on a plane trip, skipping a page here and there, and not miss anything important. Equating human male sexual behavior to animal behavior is not a new idea and other writers have done it far better. Author has shaped her narrative through this gimmick and that's all the book has going for it, which isn't much. Can't believe it was a best seller (then again, I willingly plunked down my dollars like everyone else, so there you go."
4,She made me relive every stomach-cramping agony,"This book is fabulous. EVERY woman has experienced a guy like Ray, maybe even Eddie. It made me remember all those horrible, sleepless nights wondering Why? Although those days are behind me, I can appreciate any writer who can make me so vividly recall how awful single life can be. But aside from that, it was funny too. I highly recommend this and send it out to friends whenever an occasion arises."
2,Very Disappointing.,"I was so disappointed in this book. The research and the constant cow comaparisons got old very quickly. The relationship that Jane was in lasted what, 5 minutes, and we are supposed to believe it destroyed her whole life? Plus, I have no sympathy for a character who goes after an engaged man. She deserved her misery. This book was completely UN-funny."
2,Sometimes funny but shallow all over,"The book was at times amusing, however fell short of my already low expectations of it. Not bad for a summer read at the beach, or a quiet weekend after a breakup, but nothing worth buying if you can borrow an old copy from someone else. Also includes such features as a cop-out ending that could be written better by...anyone."
4,"Don't watch the movie, read the book instead","Laura Zigman is the O.G. Chick Lit queen. Animal Husbandry taps into what a lot of women are thinking and feeling right after a break up. This book is written with a smartness that seems lacking in a lot of chick lit today. I like how even Ray, the man who breaks Jane's heart, is written in a dimensional way. You really get how she falls for him, despite all the warning signs. Most of us have been there in some way or another.Pick up this book if you want a good example of the genre."
5,great book,This is an excellent book. It's easy to read and has a lot to say about relationships. Should be required reading for both men and women.
3,"Whiny novel, but funny at times.","This novel is okay, but nothing special. The protagonist whines throughout, but at times is insighful. It's worth reading of you have nothing better to do."
2,"Nearly answers the question ""How do I get over him?""","I had a traumatic breakup in the middle of last year. A lot of Zigman's observations are similar to mine. I agree that somehow people have to get over it and basically do ""whatever it takes"". She took up cow studies. I took up kickboxing and golf. But that's where the similarities end. She didn't reflect sufficiently on the essence of really getting over him. That last chapter when she says it's over when she says it over should have been explored further. Zigman could have got more mileage out of that and made Jane Goddall more thoughtful and introspective. Nonetheless it was quite a fair first attempt. I hope her next work about dating Big Bird will actually hit the nail on the head."
4,a wonderfully funny look at a fact of life,"The other reviews astound me. Stop taking this book so seriously. It is not a handbook on dealing with a breakup, it is a VERY funny look at one woman's way of coping with her relationship. I laughed out loud many times, and nodded in agreement at most of what Zigman writes. This is such a treasure of a book. I have not just been dumped, but this book brings back memories of when I had. I think everyone that has ever been in a relationship can see aspects of themselves throughout. I can not wait until she writes again. I really enjoyed reading every page of this novel."
2,Read it for the catharisis of a breakup- nothing else!,"To add my opinion to all the above... yes, this book looked so promising, and gave so little. The Old-Cow/New-Cow theory is not that radically new. More than that, the author beat the concept into our heads with her repetition and details of it! I can see how someone would enjoy this if they needed a book to cry with. For the rest of us single-and-dealing-with-it women, we need a bit more."
5,Laughing through a broken heart,"I found this book as I was wandering through a bookstore in a post break-up zombie fashion. As soon as I read the cover I knew my search for something to help heal my broken heart was over. This book was like therapy for me. I loved it so much I went out and bought it for every old cow I knew as a Christmas present. I know these reviews are supposed to be critical of the content, but how can I begin to critique a book that could make me laugh through my broken heart?"
2,Nothing new here,"While Ms. Zigman writes a snappy text in her first book, the content itself was nothing we have not read before. Men are pigs (or bulls) who leave women when the novelty wears off. The Cow theory is merely designed to make the whole premise seem new, but the whole book deals with no new territory.I found the book hard to recommend and hope Ms. Zigman's next book does not waste her witty writing on mediocre content like this."
2,Great book! Bad ending,"I thought that Animal Husbandry was a very good book. Especially, the little similarities between bulls, man and other members of the animal kingdom. I had a hard time putting down, unitl I reached the last chapter...Though insightful, thoughtful, witty, and frightfully similar to my own life, I felt the book only had one flaw...the ending. Unless Laura wanted the story to come ""full circle"", where the characters ended up almost exactly where they all started. Maybe being an American I wanted a happy ending.(?) Pulling for Jane to finally find happiness, even if it was in an unusual place (Eddie). But for the last chapter to start out with ""Well what did happen to everyone..."" was a bit of a let down. But entertaining and hunorous all the same."
4,Cure for the Breakup Blues,The ultimate in mind candy. It's a super fast read featuring an entertaining and reachable heroine. I highly recommend this book to anyone who's ever had their heart broken.
2,Where's the Beef?,"Pun intended... I kept waiting for this story to take off, and it never really did. When the protagonist is dumped by her ready-to-be-live-in-lover, her world is turned upside down, and she looks for meaning between the pages of ""Scientific American."" A great premise, but no payoff. The whole thing seemed like a lead-up to SOMETHING... a revenge fantasy brought to life, a romance that would erase her memories of Ray... but nothing. Great writing, and some funny lines, but definitely lukewarm chicklit. You can do better with your time."
1,Don't bother!,"This is a vapid, insipid, unsatisfying read. It is surprising how little depth there is to this book, surprising because the idea is somewhat interesting. The execution, however, is insulting, especially written by someone who worked in publishing. Not one effort put into writing a good sentence. It was like reading someone's high school journal."
4,A Highly Entertaining First Novel,"I am surprised that some people would find this book male-bashing. Perhaps it hits a little too close to home. I couldn't put this book down. The main characters are funny, smart, and interesting, and I would want to be friends with them. This is one of the most entertaining first novels I've ever read."
3,Funny and unique look at male-female relationships.,"In Zigman's debut novel, the main character Jane Goodall takes a unique and humorous look at love, love lost, and the complex relationships between men and women and why we can't seem to understand each other. Some of her thoughts ring so true while others are so far fetched you have to laugh. All in all a good book and I would definitely read more from Zigman."
3,Not everything you read has to be meaningful,"I actually liked the saga of Jane Goodall (not THAT one) more than that damn Bridget Jones' story. At least Jane was aware that she was pathetic and the quotations interspersed throughout made me feel like I was learning a little about science and philosophy. Even so, Jane, her friends, Joan and David (whose shoes I happen to adore)her roommate and especially the one who got away are all a real bore after a while. Roy is unlovable and perhaps Ms. Zigman is guilty of writing a novel based a little too closely on personal tragedy because she truly characterizes Roy as the worst kind of wimp. He is absolutely pathetic and Jane's long slump that follows their breakup renders her pathetic. However, the book is light reading (make that lite) and harmless. Getting upset about the sexual politics of this book is a little like hating Elmo's morals."
2,It Feels Like We've All Been Here Before........,"""Animal Husbandry"" by Laura Zigman really misses the mark. It feels very familiar and it doesn't offer any new concept or view. It doesn't add anything new to this category of fiction. It takes easy and cheap shots at men and relationships. While, there are moments of fun and humor, it just doesn't string together with enough force. I am a fan of Laura Zigman's ""Dating Big Bird"" and was excited about this book. But, I was let down and disappointed with it's results. Not worth your time of money...spend that on ""dating big bird."""
3,get over it,"While the writing style is smart and witty, I just wanted to shake the protagonist! How could an intelligent, successful 30-something get so broadsided by a six-week relationship? Hard to muster sympathy for a woman whose behavior is reminiscent of high-school."
3,most women can relate,"Jane Goodall has been dumped like a hot potato. No warning, out of the clear blue, her boyfriend disappears out of her life. If you have ever been thru a similar situation, you will totally relate with her behavior in the aftermath. In an effort to cope with - and even delay - her grief, she destracts herself with a research project to find out how and why someone could be totally in love with her one moment, and completely switch of his feelings in the next moment. She begins to obsessively research the parallels between animal behavior in mating and human behavior in mating and finds some surprising similarities.I flew thru this book, but was disappointed in the ending. It seemed as if the author didn't really know how to wrap it all up, so she just picked a day in the character's life and decided that would be the end of the book. The book was a unique concept, I just wish the ending had been as good as the rest of the book."
4,Straight forward,"We really don't get to know Jane, just kind of dive into it. This book is original and creative in how it plays out. Jane is a little crazy. I expected more from Eddie but I was bummed out by his lacking character. Jane's character seemed depressed before, during, and after Ray - so it was kind of hard to tell? But otherwise this book is witty and interesting - definitely a fast read."
3,insightfully funny,"I read this book a few months ago, enjoyed it, found it funny, and forgot about it. I was not inspired by any of the characters, neither was I turned off by them, yet I still enjoyed it and do recommend it. It's obviously meant to be an entertaining tale of a woman with low-self esteem dumped by a louse and how she chooses to move on. All the characters have flaws, with a few stereotypical traits thrown in here and there (i.e. the best friend who is gay and dresses to the nines). It's not meant to be a theoretical breakthrough in the pyschology of men. It's just a funny, sometimes silly, novel."
3,Another entry in the hip New York City single woman genre.,"Yes it's funny and hip but so what, we have seen this story dozens of times already, including the gay male best friend. Smart, hip, unloved, single New York career woman is dumped by unfeeling yuppie male. Jane, the main character spends 300 pages 'kvetching' about being dumped by Ray, her boss, after dating for three months. Get over it girl! If you want an entertaining book for the beach or an airplane trip try it, otherwise it's just a remake of many others."
2,"and she said, ""Get a life!""","Am I the only one who feels that the novel's protagonist is, shall we say, pathetic? I didn't quite feel the motivation behind Jane's desperation. She did only ""go out"" with Ray for a couple of months, did she not? Or did I miss something?! The strongest character in the book by far is Joan, and that isn't saying much. There is so much more that I would like to know about the book's characters, but unfortuately, Zigman doesn't quite divulge the details."
3,"Cute, entertaining, little heavy on the smoking!","I enjoyed reading Laura Zigman's first novel. Smart, witty, entertaining, and well researched, it gave a name to a theory that I believe in. But all the cigarette smoking and drinking (naming brand names, no less) bothered me. I started to think I was reading a movie script wannabe."
2,Didn't work for me,"This book really didn't work for me on any level. I tried to find it funny, but didn't. I tried to feel sympathy for the narrator, but couldn't. I never really believed that she was so invested in that one brief relationship, and I never believed that she trusted him that much to begin with, so her endless devastation never rang true to me. I found the book mostly repetitive, unbelievable and unfunny."
3,A REAL Guide to Men's Thoughts,The old-cow-new-cow theory describes in detail what most women feel while in a downward spiraling relationship. This should be a book sex-ed teachers assign young girls so that they can learn that crying over failed relationships will really get you nothing. Entertaining and a true to life tale.
5,A Outstanding Novel,I really loved reading Animal Husbandry every night. It was very funny and sad at times. Over all Zigman did good writing. Can't wait till her other novel comes out.
1,"Great album, lousy CD","I agree with the earlier review about the mastering. You can clearly hear vinyl noise on some tracks. Why they ripped an LP is beyond me- several of these songs turn up on Vinegar Joe compilations, which should prove that the master tapes are available. Even if they weren't, you'd expect Lemon to use a decent copy of the vinyl, without the scratches which are only too evident here"
2,"Great record, but disappointed in the ""digital remastering""","This CD was remastered from a vinyl master, not the original tapes. Avoid unless you are a completest."
3,Vinyl Copy?,"I love this album and wanted a copy to replace my vinyl record, but this is just a copy recorded from a vinyl record. CD's aren't supposed to have pops and crackles in it. Bloody shame as this album is an absolute cracker. Just have to keep playing the vinyl. Makes me wonder if Lemon Records are all like that, and the license from Universal Records is legit. Wished I had read the reviews before wasting my time with this copy. Will try and see if the other version available here is better."
2,"Good album, bad cd transfer","Great album that was transfered from vinyl to digital with pops and scratches intact. Avoid Lemon Records releases, quality is obviously not a concern to them."
4,a simple enriching memoir,"This is a true story that reads like an adventure story, of a sixteen year-old bride's travels, hardships & triumphs during the Great Depression. Donnie who has never been more than sixty miles away from her parents' & grandparents' homes, & now, with her young husband, Will, she's off to California ""the land of sunshine and oranges; the land where everyone finds a job.""In those long ago years, when you could fill up on $1.25, the roads were hardly more than wagon ruts & gas stations were few & far between, they drive until sunset each day, then sleep out under the stars. For all their poverty, & their trepidation about finding work & a safe place to live, their optimism is unquenchable: ""Tomorrow, maybe we'll find work"" is their daily mantra on their trek.ODYSSEY OF INNOCENTS is an enriching, unsophisticated memoir of a distant America, of hard times among ordinary, simple people driven to extraordinary efforts. Certainly destined to become a family heirloom."
3,Solid and informative,"A seemingly very useful, comprehensive guide to small business collections, complete with charts and tables to be used by the small business owner. This book covers everything from the soft-sell approach to legal recourses, and everything in between, along with advice on which approach might be best in any given situation. I like that it's open enough to allow for various different types of approaches, thereby giving the reader some leeway and choices to apply to his or her own particular situation."
2,Honest descriptions of product condition,"I'm a frequent customer of Amazon.com and have had great experience with the website. I particularly like that the website remembers me and suggests other similar books and CDs I might like.The only bad experience I have had was with the purchase from a vendor of the book, Five California Architects. The owner mentioned only a slight mar on the cover. What was not mentioned were pencil markings throughout the text. The pencil appeared to be one with a hard lead because the indentations on the pages were deep. These markings acted as disruptions in the content and ruined its reading for me. I ended up tossing the book. I did make note of the vendor, though, and won't ever order anything from that individual again."
3,"Interesting, but needs an art touch","It's quite interesting to see very nice ladies in 3D on diferent scenarios, but the performance is quite borring after few minutes, so this productions need a touch of art to be much more atractive. It may be the models used or the locations, but if you see a video from Femjoy or even Playboy, you'll understand what I mean."
2,Similar but not the same...,"I was somewhat disappointed when the purchase arrived, because it wasn't the same quality as the picture online. It was a similar but cheaper version..."
4,Just as ordered,Jersey came on time and matched-up with the description. Quality is as expected for the replica jerseys; numbers and letters are not embroidered as they are on the $100+ jerseys. So I got what I expected which is always a good thing.
5,Manning Jersey,"Product was as expected. What can you say about a football jersey? Due to the ""franchise"", product is expensive in my opinion. That said, our grandson really likes it."
4,Great Jersey Purchase!,"I couldn't be happier with the quality, price, or shipping of the Peyton Manning jersey I recently ordered through Amazon."
1,Shameful,"Shameful. I grew up near the Adler family in Boulder, CO and witnessed the emotional damage inflicted on children by the authors of this book. By choosing the role of observers rather than parents, the Adler's coddled and encouraged socially destructive behavior in their daughter and her friends. Instead of intervening when children did the nasty things that children often do (as any responsible parent would), they took notes while allowing cruel behavior to escalate. Thus, the behavior they observed was distorted, if not fabricated, by their parental absenteeism. More disturbing, they subjected unknowing children to unnecessary manipulation and trauma."
1,Total [poop],"These ""researchers"" used the most unethical and unscientific methods to obtain their results. I was a student in their daughter's class and they essentially encouraged her and her friends to torment other students. Apparently in high school, they published minors' accounts without their consent! The conclusions they came to were far from my observations. They should be ashamed of themselves for making money off of using their own children as guinea pigs. Don't give them a cent of encouragement by buying this book. They put a bad name on psychology."
3,Blue moon in her eyes,"I've read (so far) all the books in the Life of Brett except the most recent and enjoyed them very much. The characters and action keep me interested despite lots of loose ends. There are so many different perpectives from so many different characters it can be hard (pardon the pun) to keep them all straight.But the stories will keep you guessing, and there is enough thrills, chills and excitement for anyone who likes suspense. In fact, whenever I watch *The Sporanos* on HBO and hear the theme song, I think of Brett! I hope she will continue to get in trouble for many years to come!;)"
1,Poorly writtten.,"This book is completely a work of fiction. The characters are poorly constructed; there seems to be large gaps while reading. The author use of proper pronouns makes you believe you are reading a Dick & Jane 1st grade reader. I do not recommend this selection, unless you what to throw your money away."
1,"Yep, it's worth waiting for a box set","I really like this show, the animation, the kickass theme song, and it's not as weird as Teen Titans was. But I'm not paying for 4 episodes, how lame is that?Worth waiting for the box set."
3,Waiting for the Season collection,"This was a great show, especially for a longtime Legion fan like me.And as soon as a full-season collection is available, I'll gladly buy it.Until then? These single-disc scams aren't getting a penny from me. I'd rather do without the episodes entirely than cater to WB's overpriced, dribs-and-drabs single-disc approach.You'll get my money as soon as you deliver something I want, Warner! Single discs aren't it."
1,Vote for the possibility of a full season DVD,"There is a free website called tvshowsondvd that allows you to vote for TV shows you would like released on DVD. You have to register in order to vote, but maybe if enough people vote for a complete series they might release one."
2,Shame on you Time Warner,This DVD is probably the reason why we have LSH toys at McDonalds this month.....It's a shame that they didn't take this opportunity to release the entire first season of the show.I'll be doing my best to wait for THAT set.
1,Waiting for full season set,I agree with the others. I'm waiting for full season sets. I know they will be released at some point. Warner Bros. did this exact same thing for Justice League Unlimited. Not falling for it this time!
1,Why Does Warner Keep Doing This?,I hate that Warner keeps doing these one disc/3 or 4 episode releases for their cartoon series first and waiting years to do full season releases. Full seasons releases are the standard now and I wish that Warner would get on board. I'll be waiting for the full season and will laugh when I see this release in the cut-out bin next year.
1,Another attempt to get at Mom and Dad's deep pockets!,"Whole season sets have been the mainstay for the past 5 years. The days of getting 2 or 4 episode per purchase died back with the VHS, except with animation. The reason is simple, parents will pay to keep their children happy. So Kids WB knows that offering this in volume will make them more money then offering it as a full season set. Similar volume sets were offered with Justice League,Batman and Superman the animated series. Later they offered those series as box sets. A true fan of the series can risk it and wait and see if the season set will be offered in 2 years but if its not they might find that the volume sets are out of print by then.I think that all animation should be offered in season sets and not piece mealed out in volumes."
1,I will be returning this item,I will be returning this item to the vendor. I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery. Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image. Not sure what BASKE stands for. I guess it's their idea of 'short for Basketball'. WHATEVER! You can't see the pic clearly. I'm out the shipping cost on this one. What a bummer!
3,just ok--not special,"Too much variety. would be too loud for backgroud music, and too many different kinds for a dance party."
5,We need more MUD,"I'm not British..never been to the UK, but I have an original vinyl LP from the 70's of Mud, and I LOVE IT. Anyone who has never heard Mud is really missing out on some freakin' GREAT music. For those who don't know, it's like taking the old rock and roll songs (i.e., Johnny B. Goode) and mixing it with GLAM rock....and it's super. They've always made me feel good after listening to them, and if you've never heard them do BLUE MOON or IN THE MOOD...then you ain't heard heard nuthin' yet!"
4,MASTERS OF CATCHY POP,"This collection contains all the hits and more. The UK band Mud had great tunes and a fine 70s uptempo pop sound. My favourites include the hook-filled Rocket (the story of Abigail Rocketblast), the very danceable Tiger Feet and songs like Dynamite and The Cat Crept In, good, buoyant pop. Other major successes include The Secrets That You Keep and Lonely This Christmas. In addition, this collection contains their versions of classics like Hippy Hippy Shake, Do You Love Me and Let's Have A Party. The sound of Mud falls somewhere between that of early bubblegum Sweet and their contemporaries Smokie, although I think Mud had a couple more blockbusters and a more consistent catchy pop sound than Smokie who often got bogged down by weepie ballads. You'll love this trip back to the seventies if you remember the time when Mud ruled the airwaves."
2,"If you have a budget, don't blow it on this book","This is a beautiful book. That's where it's usefulness ends. It will look lovely sitting on your coffee table. That's where it will stay too because it's useless if you have any kind of monetary restrictions. If you are looking to build your dream house from scratch, go for it. If you want practical ways to use the space that you already have, skip this book. Use the $25 to buy a shelf!!"
1,Who Cares?,"Time was when you could ask three questions of science/nature writing: Is it important? Does it matter? Would anything change if the reverse conclusions were reached? The answer had better be ""yes"" to at least one question. Of course, the answers to those questions when asked about A Rum Affair are ""No,"" ""No,"" and ""No.'One thing was determined, however, and that was that a book can be written about anything---the spare change in your pocket, the color of dirt, whatever. It seems curiously reversed that I paid money to read this book when someone should have paid me a hefty sum to read it. Just awful."
3,Soft and lightweght!,"I've bought 2 pairs for $40.0-fair price!I've got 2 doubts - smell of synthetic ,and durability???"
5,These are the only sandals I wear!!!!!!!!!,"I own all colors and textures of Propet Slides. With the upper and lower hook and loop adjustment, you always have the perfect fit. The foot bed comforts ever part of your foot. Since I live in Florida, I wear these slides year round and they are the only sandals I wear. What else can I say, I LOVE THEM!Propet Women's Marina Walker Sandal"
3,A little slow,I'm still a beginner but even I felt the relevant beginner fat burning dvd was a little slow. Good techniques but would've liked to actually feel a workout like with some other dvds I've used in the past. Hopefully the more advanced routines in the dvds is better.
4,Thorough but Slow,"I have many yoga DVDs. This one has a ton of options and is, therefore, worth the price. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that it does not flow as quickly as some of my more favorite tapes (my fave being Rodney Yee, Colleen Saidman, and S. Deason). It is rather slow with little breaks between the poses (probably so the poses can be spliced into other routines). However, the stretches and poses are deep and long enough to really feel good during, after the routine, and for the rest of the day or night. Although not in my top ten list, I would definitely recommend. I've been practicing yoga for 3 or 4 years, am in my 50's, and consider myself intermediate at best."
5,Not easy and just what I wanted,"I disagree that this is not for beginners. It is difficult for a beginner at first but you gain strength right away and it becomes challenging, in a good way. It is exactly what I was looking for. These DVD's are great bc you can select the length of the routine and you can add warm-up and cool downs. Plus it doesn't have a long intro that doesn't allow you to fast forward like most. Never have I seen so much variety in a set of DVD's. I'm very pleased and can't wait to try all of the routines."
4,Pretty Good,"I ordered these DVDs because I thought they were a good deal and because the videos were shot outside. I live in Minnesota and needed some outdoor eye candy to make it through the winter! I liked the first 2 DVDs, but the 3rd ""Power Yoga"" has the most routines on it and was shot inside a studio. Plus, the final DVD uses blocks, and belts- something I do not want to deal with. Simple enough to modify routines, but bummed about the last DVD. Overall, I enjoy the routines and the calming mountain or ocean landscape."
3,Good but very involved,I should have limited my search for a more beginner type DVD. This one is good but very involved and too long..
4,Newbie To Yoga,I bought this as a beginner to yoga. I really wanted to utilize it as the stretching period after my regular workout. It is very informative in teaching MANY yoga poses. So far I have really enjoyed it! I would recommend this.
1,Not for beginnings.,I bought this DVD because I have friends that say very positive things about Yoga and I was interested in getting started. I wanted a DVD I could learn from before paying for a class. This is NOT for beginners. There is no instruction. It is simply routines that move quickly from pose to pose without explanation. I learned nothing from this DVD. It was a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER WITH NO EXPERIENCE!!!
3,Useful product,It was a little hard for me but product pretty good. I am a bit to old or to out of shape to use it much
2,Yoga for Weightloss,I could not get all the DVD's to work in my player. I have tried over and over. I should have returned it.
4,Great for some quick yoga,"As a new mom, I needed a DVD with lots of routines with different lengths. This is perfect for what I need. I can't always get to the yoga studio, so this is great for me to do when the kids are napping or late night when they are sleeping."
3,"question, and suggestion",I like the telescoping idea. I can't find any mention of the X magnification.I would love this mirror in a X 15 magnification.
4,Works OK for me,"I get 3 1/2 hours on my IBM T23. You need to set the power management to battery optimized performance by hand, since the computer thinks it's still plugged into the wall. Also, I run the monitor on about half its peak brightness, which extends even the normal battery life.It's fine, convenient enough, and _slightly_ cheaper per hour than OEM batteries. Rating is 12.8 V, 4.05 Amp-Hours. The expansion option (a second battery unit that mechanically docks) looks clever, although I only have the main unit. This external battery is particularly useful when I do not want to keep a battery in the drive bay."
1,"Sorry, only 1 hour of power","The product falls far short of the hype. I have used it with the tiny, 12 inch screen Averatec, and it only delivers one additional hour of computer time. I have to turn the screen brightness as dim as possible, and shut down a few background programs, too. The extra hour is nice, however, as it shifts over to the laptop battery when depleted, without having to shut down to change the laptop battery. This is the only reason the system receives one star. I am going to keep on waiting and watching for an external system that really lasts."
1,After one year this product is unusable...,I purchased this product on 12/15/2004 within a year it would not a hold a charge that lasted longer than 10 minutes. It's display 3 lights at full charge... even after charging for 8 hours straight it only gives one light.It did give a good 3 hours of power when you used minimum monitor brightness and turned on the laptop to conserve power... but don't expect the battery to have the staying power of your standard laptop battery.
1,Steer away from this product.,"The product promises a lot and delivers way short. I had to return 2 batteries because they didn't charge up (blinking light on first, then battery light not showing charge at all). The third one that worked only powered by fully charged laptop for 1.5 hours. That's 1.5 hours of web surfing. That is no where near 5-hours it promised. For the price, you are better off investing in a 2nd laptop battery."
1,A terrible product!,"Only gives under 2 hours of power, the same power u get on oem laptop batteries, at lesser space and bulk. OVER-HYPED advertisement of UP TO 5HR CHARGE. That my friends may be true if you are carrying this LOG, along with your super-mini pda, cellphone, and digicam devices. WHAT A JOKE, if you carry these around with your charger as a LUGGAGE! It's cheap, and you get what you paid for. BE VERY CAREFUL! N-Charge wants to make a quick buck by FALSE ADVERTISEMENT AND INSIDE REVIEWS (providing exemplary comments, see the 5-star reviewer here as proof). DON'T BUY THIS ITEM. GET THE APC UNIVERSAL LAPTOP CHARGER INSTEAD. PCMAG HAS CONFIRMED IT TO WORK, AND WORK FOR UP TO 8 HOURS, LEGIT."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"Do not buy this product. You will be throwing your money away!It does not work, period.I am giving it 1 star, because, this is the lowest rating possible, otherwise I would give it a minus!This piece of junk never even worked once!!!"
4,Definitely a good buy!!!,"This is definitely a good study guide. I used this before taking the ASVAB and scored an 87, which is pretty damn good. Worth every penny. Good luck to all who use this!"
2,Buy another review book.,"This is a horrible review item...many of the problem types (especially math) were not ever tested on the ASVAB. Never did I answer a question about ""Which gears will be rotating in the same direction"" yet every practice test contains 2-4 questions of this type. The real ASVAB is much more difficult, and this book prepares you for an average score at best.Another example is the section on assembling objects. It tells you the types of questions the ASVAB tests you on, and then gives you completly different types of problems.I'm giving this book two stars (instead of one) because the CD-Rom was nice to use, but really didn't ask good questions. Another reason for two stars instead of one is that I took the CAT-ASVAB, and who knows, maybe the paper and pencil version of the test is similar to practice tests in this book."
1,Too complicated for kids,"I bought one of these for a 8 year old. It is really not suitable for for youngsters. The camera is difficult to open to load film, the film must be manually wound after each shot and the small knob for that is difficult to use. The flash must be turned on manually each time before you take an indoor picture. If you forget to turn on the flash it will let you take a picture but of course it will be too dark. You must also unfold a little handle and manually rewind the film when you are finished. I prefer the similar Kodak F310 for a few dollars more it has automatic flash and automatic film advance - still comes in see thru colors."
4,cute,it's so very cute but not very long i had to buy 2 to just cover my daughters window. but otherwise i'm thrilled
5,Deadly Deceits,"Ralph McGehee's book serves as an eye-opening glimpse into our nation's CIA history. From his beginning as a ""gung-ho"" patriot until his growing disillusionment with the Agency, leading to retirement, McGehee reveals the truth behind the many of the CIA's operations, not only domestically and in well-known regions of the world, but also within areas quite unaddressed by the common American. His revelations about the Agency were somewhat shocking to a naturally pessimistic person as myself. However, I found this book very helpful especially in my position as a student who's life began after much of the book's coverage occured, because it reawakened me to the dishonesty and means the CIA employs in order to acheive its goals not only in important past events, but even up to the present."
5,One that works,"My wife and I have cleaned house's for years and go thru alot of steam cleaners and vaccums, this steam cleaner is great, well built, plenty of steam and longer time than others, it is the best way to get rid of germs, you'll like this one..."
1,broken steamer,I received this steamer and it did not work... the cap could not be removed to add the water. When I wrote to the vendor I was told I would have to pay shipping charges both ways... and I did not want to pay for 3 shippings. I was disappointed with this item... and would not order another.
4,steam cleaner,"This little cleaner makes me feel that the Bathroom is CLEAN ! I am satisfied with the job it does, pleased with the weight, and would buy another one."
3,It gurgled and spat...,Interesting product...did work ok..it was sort of fun to have this steam wooshing out...but sometimes it gurgled and spit water everywhere. If you're going to be holding it for a while...you'll need to use two hands...it can get heavy. I returned it and bought a Shark steamer from Target. Much better for our application.
2,"It's a great steamer, not so much a cleaner.","If you're looking for a streamer for windows, or to sterilize things, it's great. To use solely for cleaning, I was a bit disappointed. It ended up being more work. Plus you have to be careful that as the steam does run and things can get a little wet while working, so be conscious of where you're using it, or place towels under what you're cleaning."
4,Buy it for the greatest Southern Rock song ever!,"There are many great Southern Rock albums and singles out there, particularly from the heyday of Southern Rock, the 1970's. Melissa, Blue Sky, and In Memory of Elizabeth Reed from The Allman Brothers, Freebird and That Smell from Lynyrd Skynyrd stand out as some of the best and most popular of that era. But none of these can match the sheer genius of Green Grass and High Tides, the greatest Southern Rock song ever and the main reason to invest in this album. The album contains some mediocre stuff, some better than average tunes (Song In The Breeze and There Goes Another Love Song stand out) but it is the final track that demands repeat listening for the amazing guitar solo, the first rate vocals, and the overall imagery created by this phenomenal piece of music. A decent album that contains a classic song."
5,the outlaws,"One of the greatest records of all time and without a doubt the greatest guitar record of all time.If you've only been playing for the past 15-20 years and have never listened to this band, this is a must have.This is what playing guitar is all about people.Hugh Thomasson and Billy Jones are the greatest 1-2 guitar punch ever.No special effects here, just pure nasty Stratocaster (Thomasson) and crystal clear Les Paul (Jones). This band was always overshadowed by Lynard Skynard and that's a shame because they are so much better. The ironic thing is that Thomasson now plays with Skynard. There is not a dud on this record. If never even thought about playing guitar before, after listening to this record I can almost promise you that you'll want to start. The only decision you'll have to make is Strat or Les Paul. Simply wonderful."
3,Good movie watch,"If you're in the mood just to have a night at the movies in your house, this was a very good movie. I saw it on Lifetime and decided to have it in my library."
1,soap opera,"If you're looking for a good whodunit, forget this one. Melodramatic soap opera only, not one earned emotion, one-dimensional stick figure characters, wooden representations of social and personal issues relating to crime and justice.If I could give it a zero, I would."
3,Remote problem,"The fan is great, but the wiring is too tight in the space available. Very hard to assemble. Also, when there is a power failure and then restored, the light comes back on. This is not good for a traveling person, since it could be on for days."
1,big dissapointment,"This fan arrived with some screws missing -- maybe reconditioned? I bougth it as ""new"" Got the missing screws at the harware store and mounted the fan. It had a very distinct/loud humming sound (not ""silent"" as Hunter claims). It also wobbles badly even at medium speed, something that coud not be corrected even with the kit included. I notified Amazon and will be returning this item as ""defective""."
1,"Bad quality, the fan failed after three days","The name Hunter is supposed to be a reference in fans. Well this one did not live up to its reputation. Although installed by a qualified and experienced electrician, it only lasted three days. I am a very disappointed customer."
1,Do not buy this product.,I installed four of these fans in my house 3 years ago. The remote control receiver unit inside the fan has stopped working on two of the four units. Please search the internet becasue many others have had the same problem. It is not a frquency setting issue: it is an electronics issue with the control board. Hunter does not stand behind the design problem and will charge an excessive price for the replacement part. The part is also difficult to replace becasue the fan has to be removed from the ceiling to access the part.
3,A lot of money for a fan that's pretty ordinary,"I ordered the fan, thinking the HUNTER name would take it a step above the rest. It turns out that the fan was difficult to install, the light is inadequate for the breakfast area in the kitchen. If you want to change the bulb, it looks like a nightmare of a task.I should have gotten the $100 fan. I would have been happier.If you want looks only...this is the fan for you.If you want functional...this is not the fan for you."
2,A little disappointed,"Since it is the winter time, I have not had the opportunity to use my fan, as of yet. But after installation, I tried it & was very disappointed with it's performance at a reasonable speed. It shakes too much when on med. or high. The installer tried to balance with weights that were provided, but this did'nt work. Not sure of what else to do."
4,Nice fan,The fan itself works great.I had trouble mounting the fan to the electrical box in the ceiling because I needed to install a wooden cross brace between the joists to hold the box. The fan is mounted by installing screws through the electrical box to the wooden cross brace instead of mounting to the threads on the box itself like some other brand ceiling fans I have installed. Maybe other manufactures do it this way also or maybe because this fan is on the heavy side.
5,"Hunter Palermo 52"" Ceiling Fan","This is a great looking fan. It matches the stainelss steel of my kitchen applicances. It was, however, difficult to install. My son installed it and he is good at this kind of stuff and it took him 2 1/2 hours. It is much more different to install than most other fans, but it is worth it for the great designer look."
2,Absolute Horror To Install,"These fans, while cool looking, are an absolute horror to install. If you buy them, be prepared to exercise your patience to the max. They provide too many screws which are similarly sized with no clear direction as to their use. Even when you do figure out which ones to use where, they don't go in correctly (especially in the ring around the light)! The fan has to be one of the poorest I have installed from an engineering perspective. Once they are installed, they perform decently - they are quiet. However, had I known what a pain it was to do the installation, I would have purchased another brand altogether. For the price paid for these fans, I would say they are not worth it. Don't say I didn't warn you."
4,"great fan, ugly blades","Easy and fast to install. Remote control based system makes wiring connections a snap.Fan istelf looks very good - nice, sleek, modern look with good quality. Reversable blades (birch look or darker oak look) are less stellar, both seem rather dingy and uninspiring.Works great, runs silently."
4,Very Solid Fan,"I got this fan because of the great contemporary styling and remote control. Almost bought it at Home Depot for $280 but then found one on-line for about $200. FYI, Costco occasionally sells what seesm to be this same fan (only in their warehouse) for $139, but they call it the Hunter Westside. I just bought my second and third ones to replace my dated fans. I had to change some dip switches so that one remote doesn't control all three at once.There is a slight delay when turning the light on and off and the light quality isn't the greatest for high usage, since it is a cicrular flourescent lamp.The fan seems to have a light hum to it, but is otherwise very smooth, stable and quiet. I was hoping to learn the signal for my universal remote, but it is radio frequency versus infrared and not possible. RF is the better quality, since it doesn't require a direct line of sight. Overall I would highly recommend this fan, particularly if you can pay $140 versus $280."
1,Remote works 98% of the time.,"I have two of these fans. One was installed hardwired with no wall switch to over-ride the controls. Unfortunately, as others have written, the remote does not always work. This has made turning the fan OFF very difficult. It once took me almost an hour to turn the fan off (pressing the off button once every 5 minutes). Both of my fans have experienced this problem. It's completely random. I went a solid 4 months with no issues. Then, when we had guests come over, I could not get the fan or light to turn on! The wife wont ever turn the fan or light on for fear of not being able to turn it off at the end of the day.I have shut down all computers and televisions in the house and still was unable to get the remote to work. The complete randomness has made trouble shooting VERY difficult."
4,Good value,"I bought 3 of these to put in our master bedroom, living room, and the family room. The fan is attractive, quiet and has light as well as the reverse function. For the price, I think the fan is a good buy, no question.A minor complaint is that the light is fluorescent and quite harsh."
4,"A nice read for, military, history and non-history buffs","Prevas educates the reader with his first-hand approach to Hannibal's journey across the Alps. Prevas, who traced Hannibal's route on foot, takes the reader to where Hannibal and his troops slept and examines how the military genius used skill, geography and luck. Great color photos, maps and summary of historical figures of Hannibal's time. A history written with the quality similiar to Stephen Ambrose. A great read for those who love history and/or the military."
3,OK for what it contains,"Finding resources for under-studied languages like Nepali is extremely difficult. It's a shame that this is one of the few books out there that teaches Nepali.I don't like the organization of the book. It doesn't teach you vocabulary, grammar, or phrases in a logical order.Learning the script was difficult since the book doesn't contain very much information on how to do so.This book should be used with another book about Nepali. But I have to warn you that the Nepali words aren't always transliterated the same way in two books.Brandon Simpson"
3,Too fast!,"I liked this set, however, it proceeds much too fast for the average learner. I lived in Nepal off and on for a year, so I had some basic Nepali skills. This set goes from zero to sixty, without enough coaching. Even the CD's progress very fast. I know it is up to the individual to learn at their own speed, but there should be more practical language skills included to get a feel (or ear) for Nepali. This set insists on learning written Nepali before really getting the sound of it. I think the Writers/Producers of this set; having already mastered the language, forget how an interested but non-scholarly person learns.I hope this is not their end-game and that they produce another for the rest of us."
3,learn Nepali,"I just browsed through the books and looks like a good book, but it does not have all the alphabets. Still a good book for beginners."
5,Pretty nice book,Book is nice and showed up fast. It covers all sorts of different topic. This is a well writen book
1,false advertising,"This product was suppose to be caramel flavored. It had so much coconut oil that is overpowered any other taste or smell. Ended up throwing it out, couldn't stand to have it in the house"
3,"Close, but no cigar.","This CD is a collection of live performances, so if you want the FM versions of any of the songs here it may not be what you're looking for. While the quality of the recording is spotty, it has a good cross section of the Commander's songs over the years. By the way, I bought my copy at ""Planet Music"" (part of the ""FYE"" group) for $4.99."
4,Grappa Glasses,"Gift for a friend. He was suppressed, mystified, didn't know there was a special glass for Grappa."
4,good rock n roll,very good c.d more of a ac-dc highway to hell sound not gonna say who recorded 1st but a all in all good recording not quite the grit h.2.h had but good
3,80's metal,"Great 80's classic. Vocals get a little silly at times but Easy rocker,Burning Bones,Winning man and She's got Everthing are must have tunes. Sounds dated but still very strong."
4,"Problems with ""12"" DVD","The film is excellent. I received this copy within the last 10 days. However the copy I received (new)had a non-smoking commercial, and 6 movie previews prior to ever finding the film itself. Since I use this movie in my Russian class, it was a mess. I was unable to cut to the film, having to fast forward through 23 minutes of stuff, unrelated to the film. I hope no one else pays $20 for a film which has at least $5.00 of preview."
5,4 1/2 Stars - Really Good Movie,"If you happen to be into foreign films, or Russian films in particular, then you should really pick this gem up. The English subtitles are actually pretty well done, so that a lot of the nuance of the dialog, the humor and tension are not lost. Terrific performances too. If you are not into foreign films and you thought that Slum Dog Millionaire was over rated then I think that you should give this movie a try. Amazon is giving it away at this price. The movie has a great feel. Hard to describe, but I think a lot of what American audiences find to be a negative about foreign films is not a problem with this film. That problem generally has to do with pacing and production values. This movie has great pacing, good tension throughout and very high production standards. Add to that a great story/script adaptation - which Hollywood hasn't delivered in years - and I think just about anyone will enjoy this movie."
4,Russian version of 12 Angry Men.,"I actually liked this version better than I did the American version with Henry Fonda which was also a good movie...be advised this is very long and in Russian and you have to read it. If you are only interested in the basic story and you don't want to read it, I would suggest you see 12 angry men. Same story in a different country and it's in English...if you LOVE IT then with a Cliff Notes idea of what is going on. Read it in Russian for two and a half hours.It is a truly great movie in both venues. But I would say not for light viewing. The whole movie takes place in the sequestration of the Jury room. It is an excellent study of human psychology as well as the influence of one person on another. It is a lot of leader/follower relationship. The amount people really care about results that effect other people."
3,for people tired of the same old Vampire mythos,"I sold my copy a few years ago... Looking back on it now, I can't remember why. This was an interesting story. Not a screamingly great trilogy but a good one just the same. It mashed up some bits of nanotech futureshock with classic vampire myths and the ever fun Madonna/Whore symbolic cues. It gets a little ""out there"" toward the end of the trilogy, as I recall but still manages to deliver an entertaining and (at times) thought-provoking read."
2,Not like the original,"My mom got this for me for Christmas not long after it came out. We both figured that since the first one was alot of fun, the second should be just as good. I was wrong. The gameplay is nothing like the first. Instead of finding Heart Containers to build up your life and buying new equipment, Adventure of Link is more like an RPG. You have to kill enemies to get experience points, and you can learn spells. The game itself also is a bit more difficult. You have 3 lives and once you loose them, that's the end. You can continue just like before, but you restart at Hyrule palace, and Hyrule has become alot larger.Overall, the game mechanics really are not that great, but if you are into building your character more, then give this game a try."
1,Did More Harm Than Good.,"At first it seemed pretty good, it really hypnotized me. Then it gets to a part where they bring you back in time to your first cigarette. This eventually gave me an 80's attitude towards smoking and I ended up smoking extra. So actually it worked backwards. I'm now struggling to get back the progress I had made before ever listening to these tapes. I would recommend you stay away from these tapes."
2,"""They cheated us""(5 out of 10)","I bought this one because of the 2 new stories but come to find out, they cheated us. They said that ""Trucks"" was a never-released story but it's really just a story off of Rusty to the Rescue called ""Rusty helps Peter Sam."" It's an okay story about Rusty helping Peter Sam when the trucks cause an accident. I guess since Rusty to the Rescue is no longer availible, this tape is good to get. Meanwhile, the new story, Gordon and the Gremlin has to be one of the worst Thomas stories of all time. It is about Gordon, who is supposedly being haunted by a Gremlin. But the gremlin turns out to be Sir Topham Hatt's mother's dog. The music video on this video are good, but if you want to buy a sing along video, get Sing-Along & stories. It has better stories and better songs."
4,Sierra Wildflowers,"I purchased this book just before I was going to Carson pass for a day's hike to look at the wildflowers. It came in very handy. It also helped me to identify most of the photographs I had taken when I got home.It is not very easy to find specific flowers in order to identify them even though there are several groupings based on colors and common and scientific names.It is by no means a complete treatise because we found flowers which were not in the book. Fortunatley we had a very knowledgeable Sierra club leader (Wildflower Roger) who helped me identify the ones I could not find in the book.Overall, it is a handy little book to have."
4,The First King Biscuit Time EP,"This CD is groundbreaking for Steve Mason's solo career. The flavor is slightly more electronic than the Beta Band, yet distinctly Steve Mason's work. It's takes a bit to get into, but it's really a good EP."
3,Be careful of descriptions,"I ordered what I thought were spoons for a place setting. When I got them they were ""big"" spoons which I interpret as tablespoons. Maybe I don't know the correct designation for silverware, but these spoons were marked for dessert spoons on the oneida sleeve labels. The spoons are way to big for me to put in my mouth so I can't relate to them being for dessert or for anything but serving spoons unless you have a huge mouth. I just beg to differ with Oneida on what they call them. The supplier was fine on returning and credit to my account. The quality of the spoons were fine. Be careful when ordering that you know what you are looking for and what you are ordering. It may not be the same."
4,Wind River,It was a good western and had twists and turns that kept you interested through out the book. Good ending
3,Just so so,"I tend to read in cycles, this was my western cycle. Good character development not a ground breaking story. True to life dialogue."
3,Good Reading Western,"This is an easy read. It has several plots going, switching back and forth from one character's situation to another. Very interesting overall. Would recommend it. Some of the expletives are thrown in, but not needed."
5,Excellent Book,"This was the 1st of 6 books in a series, was a very good book to read, for the price you can't go wrong. I was very happy that I had bought this book, was a hard book to put down, was always glad to get back to it."
4,Keep on reading the series,I am sorry to keep repeating myself. Read the series in order. You will be glad you did and the stories are good. The details are excellent and plot is always evolving.
4,Great openiong Series Book,"Great first book for a series. Good to have westerns were everything does not end perfect and the good guys ride off into the subset. A new western town being built, new railroad and a founding fateher is killed.No marshal in town, train robbery, a ""soiled dove"" is with child by a dead man, a British doctor has to keep a twon calm before they riot and burn it to the ground. A posse chase, deputy runs into trouble, indians. It all ties together very well and a good picture of a new western town is given. Makes you want to read more when it is over. Best part is there are other books in the series. Great reprint form many years ago while it seems you are living every moment with the character at hand. Enjoy it, I did."
3,good,Good it keeps your intrest untill you have read it completly .you shoild enjoy it very very much .amust read .
4,An interesting story,"I love westerns and this book didn't let me down. Believable characters, a good mix of action and mystery too."
4,good story,I liked the story. I ended up buying the rest of the books in the Wind River series. Recommend them to anyone who enjoys westerners.
3,Just Ok,I wasn't overly impressed with this book.....I had all of the Wind River series in my wish list......but I am not going to order any more. I have read many better western writers.
5,Great overview,"Exactly as the title says--concise guide on biochemical methods. It also has a short chapter on biophysical methods, and another on mathematical methods.Honestly, the price is a bit much for the item...but it a very good book--clearly written. I bought it and I was not disappointed at all.PROS:Concise.Brings together lots of hard to find information.Solid explanations.Cons:Price."
5,A Must Buy!!,"The Book of Rock has a unique quality as it captures the rock era absolutely perfectly. Philip Dodd is a master of telling you how it is (or was), and he has struck a perfect balance with regard to content. In my eyes the author will go down as legend alongside the stars that it portrays!From One happy reader!!"
4,Jermaine Stewart,A great follow up to his previous album. He had style and class. A great mix of pop and soul that makes you feel groovy and romantic!
4,Sweet as honey,LOVE THEM !It took me forever to find these.Everyone who I have given them to to try has loved them & want MORE!Shipping is on the high side though.
1,?????? ????? ????,"Although I appreciate all these hits, these renditions are tired, boring, and out of tune."
5,A Fantasic Walk Down Memory lane,Birtles Shorrock Goble ? Who! Well they where the people who started the Little River band (LRB). They have got back together and sound just as fantastic as the did back in their LRB days. There band sounds like there studio recordings and the songs have stayed the test of time.I have had it playing for over a week in the car. I Just saw them live in concert and they are Fantastic! The CD Captures the feel of the concert. I love it and if you love LRB I'm sure you will too.The big difference between the Aussie version of Full Circle and the US version is it has totally remixed! Great CD buy it!
4,Very good Beats,"This Group has very good beats and lyrics.But the rap is to soft.I'm a HC rap fan that y i think this is to soft.sometimes it's Hard but not so often. Put c.r.o.w. , Flame or chilly chill here and this would be very hard west side rapIf you like 2pcs beats you gonna like this beats."
3,Magz for father and sons,"I bought this toy to have fun with my son, age 5.The magnets are very powerful for their size. Grabbing for a few of them at one time is next to impossible as all the pieces try to join in the fun. We bought a box with compartments for sorting the pieces, and while this helps when starting the building process, it takes a long time to separate them out afterwards.The instructions include a few pictures of structures that can be built, but no step by step instructions. I can't find step by step instructions on the web either, just single images. My son general makes long chains right now. I've figured out how to make most of the structures, but I don't believe I am the target audience.Some of the pieces survived being ""stolen"" by a cat, which is good, but it's likely that the balls will eventually be lost based on our experiences -- they sometimes go flying when you try to detach them from the stick magnets.This toy might be better suited to an older child, perhaps 7+."
4,Atomic structure,I bought this toy to understand atomic structures. It was extremely useful and helped me alot. I reccomand this product to those who want to have a deep understanding of spacial symmetry and structures that are difficult to recognize on paper. The product is not very durable but it is easy to be just a little accurate and get a good result
2,Canker sore toothpaste/Rembrant,I have used this toothpaste previously to help with canker sores. This is not the same paste that I have pruchased under the Rembrant name and does not work as well. I don't know if the manufacturer has changed and the new owner is still using the Rembrant name but it certainly is not the same paste.
1,New Formula is NOT canker free,"I had been using Rembrandt for years, because I'm guaranteed to get canker sores from regular toothpaste. So when the new tubes came (I order several at a time) I figured it was just an update on the packaging and not a new formula, as the canker sore labeling was still there. Yet within a day of using the new stuff, the inside of my mouth was entirely covered in canker sores. I even got one on my lips, a first. It took a few days for all of them to go away, but this is obviously not the same toothpaste as before.If a company changes a formula on something like this, that should be made clear. Pain is a great disincentive for your regular customers."
4,Helpful,"This product helped me a lot. Similar to what they found in studies, my canker sores dropped by about 80%.Another product, however, apparently has eliminated my canker sores altogether when used with the toothpaste. The supplement is called DGL, for deglycyrrhizinated licorice. Supposedly for sensitive stomachs. You chew tablets at the first sign of a sore. Tastes bad, but worth it."
1,Shallow,"A blurb on the cover suggests that ""Trust"" will interest readers who enjoyed ""The DaVinci Code"". I was not much interested in ""The DaVinci Code"", and found ""Trust"" to be shallow and undeveloped in the same manner."
3,Engaging and an easy read...,"The author clearly knows his way around international banking. The book is a good relaxing read and keeps you interested enough that you will find yourself picking it up often. I wish that the author did not have to ""tell"" you everything his characters are thinking and the motive behind those thoughts. Some things should be left up to the reader to deduce and then validate later in the story. Had it not been for this consistent and constant foreshadowing, I would have given this book higher marks. Still, if you like stories that have factual, credible details, you will not be disappointed."
3,Most everyone can relate to her struggles...,"I have a soft spot for Luann because she is so relatable! I mean, who didn't want to be more popular in school, have a crush on a popular person who didn't notice you, or felt self-conscious about how they look? Luann faces all those issues with a vulnerability that is heartwarming."
5,Awesome wine glass clips!,"Absolutely perfect wine glass clips. Stainless steel is sleek and beautiful. Fit perfectly even on my thick, beveled plates; rubber inside grips plate firmly. Holds wine glass securely. Will be perfect gift for the holidays. Packaging very attractive and easy to wrap. Love, love, love these clips!"
2,"not good, just answers for odd number problems","I bought this solution book for my statistics course's homework. To be honest, it is of some use because it provides complete answers for the problems listed in the textbook. However, only odd number problems are provided, and provided answers are low-quality, which means the procedure is flank and some important steps are omitted.In a word, not worthy of $30"
2,Student Solutions Manual Review,"This review is for the Student Solutions Manual. I was hoping that this would provide me a complete set of solutions for the book ""Probability and Statistics: The Science of Uncertainty."" However, it includes only odd numbered problems solutions which are already included in the the back of the text book. It does provide a bit more background and methodology on how to solve the problems using Minitab, but doesn't provide much incremental value compared to the actual text book."
1,Do not purchase this book!,"I have been teaching statistics for the last three years. I have (and I think successfully) taught biostatistics, business statistics, and engineering statistics for scientists and engineers. It is my opinion that this book is worthless. I do not know why it has gone into another edition. Do not waste your money on this book or any course that uses it. It is junk."
4,Good mix of Step workout and Kick-boxing,"I have been doing both step-aerobics and kickboxing for several years and got quite a good workout with this DVD. As mentioned in previous reviews, the cueing is quite poor compared to Cathe Fredrich's workouts, but if you do the tutorial before starting the actual workout it does help. I had to focus throughout the workout to not make any mistakes. By the third time I was much more comfortable and actually used weighted gloves while exercising with this DVD.The first 60 minutes is a combination of step and kickboxing, followed by approximately 10 minutes of pure kickboxing. The next segment is abdominals done in the kneeling position which is very unusual followed by a cool down. The overall workout time is almost 80 minutes.This workout is definitely for people who are used to step workouts, i.e. moderately advanced.Overall, I have enjoyed this DVD!"
3,My review,"This is a interesting movie, not enough dialog with the characters, and needed more story, there were only a few fight scenes. It could have been so much better. If your into fight movies just for the fighting then this is a decent movie. the fighting was amazing, and if you like to pay attention to acting then this is not the best interest to watch."
4,Good movie to immediate video release,Michael Jai White's acting in this movie was TERRIBLE!! I generally like his roles but this one sucked badly. It was entertaining for one sit down movie. I'll probably never watch this movie again.
4,Undisputed 2,"New Title 1 A Walk Through Life by Duane Ashley PooleUndisputed 2 has a great story line showing you how young fighter George Ice man Chambers easily gets framed and set up by the russian mafia so they can get George to fight the prisons fighting champ Uri Boyka. In order for his freedom he must fight or stay falsely imprisoned for the rest of his days.This is a fantastic follow up to the first Undisputed, and the fight scenes will blow you away!."
3,not really a sequel,"I saw the original it was also mediocre, it was a bad drama boxing movie.this is a worse drama much worse acting, weak martial arts movie.there is a reason white has never been in a decent movie, the others are even more obscure all with good reason.if you want martial arts and action in a b movie watch blood fist series."
3,Scott is Worth Seeing. LOADS of Profanity In This Poorly Written Script,"I was disappointed by the poor writing of this script - primarily the LACK of development of a compelling story and the crappy dialogue that Michael Jai White is given. He deserved much better than what he was given.The LAST 1/2 of the movie is much better and develops several other characters and supporting crew.If the first 1/2 would have taken the care of the last 1/2, my rating would be higher.Michael Jai White is a very good fighter. However this movie primarily showcases the athletic prowess of Scott Adkins, who performs some phenominal moves for the camera. This guy is in beyond AWESOME shape. He plays his part quite adeptly.I'm looking forward to seeing him in more films.This movie is not for kids."
2,undisputed 2,"A pretty good movie, it was definetly better than I expected it to be, good enough for me to submit a review about it."
2,There Are Better T/A Books,This book is OK but nothing special. He uses some tools that I have never seen in any TA software like Market Profile. Also lots of stuff on point & figure plus candlesticks which I do not use too much.There are some new approaches but you may want to look at other books.
5,The price is ridiculous!,"This instrument is so fine. As close to a pro-model that money can buy.HOWEVER, it is listed here between $3000-$4000 TOO HIGH! Look elsewhere if interested. You will not be dissapointed with the bassoon."
1,Avoid this Book,"This book is ""junk!"" It explains statistics in such a way that it will get you more confused, if you are not already. I suggest you get this book, only, if you have a strong understanding of it. But if you don't understand statistic than I suggest you get something else to complement its complexity."
2,"This is for my class, so I have to...","I feel like I am rather taking longer path instead of right well organized one. Well, I am OK with Math person, so it may be good for Math hater.Anyway, my instructor is nice enough, so overall I satisfied with my class."
3,Nice book however....,The book looks great except for one thing...there is a giant slit down the spine of the book....it looks like someone took a box cutter to it. This was not listed in the product details. Very disappointed about that. Other than that the book is great.
4,Exactly the same as a regular Stats course,"I bought this book to go along with my required Elementary Statistics course. The problem is that I've already been required to take a Probability and Statistics course. They are pretty much identical with the only exception being that the Statistics for Psychology textbook makes sure that all of its examples are those of psychological studies. More on the fault of my college than the book. It does it's job of explaining the concepts, which are elementary. There is an entire chapter dedicated to finding the mean, median, and mode. Thrilling read.."
5,Book is easy to understand,Book is very easy to understand. Provides the reader with many examples to grasp the idea that is being conveyed. I really enjoy learning statistics through the use of this book.
2,errors,"although this book is not bad and explains statistical concepts in a nice way, the amount of errors this book has is huge.it feels like the writers of this book wrote it fast cuze the errors are not conceptual - they are numerical.so for paying so much money for this - i expected more than that."
5,Perfect for undergrads and grad students alike,"I was amazed w/how clearly this book explained concepts (as compared with other books/professors). The book also explains the concepts in different ways/perspectives, so that if you don't understand one explanation you're likely to understand the others. The book also has a perfect range of material--complete coverage of Z-scores, t-tests, regression, and ANOVAs; all the way thru concepts like MANOVA/MANCOVA, and multiple regression. Also at the end includes a couple great chapters which give very simple explanations of more complex procedures such as structural equation modeling, causal modeling, factor analysis, etc. By far the best stats book I've read."
3,i very much dislike statistics,"only rated it at 3 because the class i needed this book for was a nightmare. otherwise, it was a good book and very helpful"
1,Dishonest,"I purchased a book from you and you tore out some of the pages critical to a chapter (pages 663 - 672) which has the Normal Curve Table and who knows what else.I am returning this book and will never purchase your items again. I don't usually buy used items, but figure if I bought a book, it would at least come with all the pages"
2,Not a hatchet job,"I first saw this book referenced in Michael Tomasky's Hillary's Turn. Tomasky described this book as a hatchet job. State of a Union is far from a negative attack on the former First Couple, and actually paints a more sympathetic portrait of the Clintons than their most fawning sycophants usually do. State of a Union is little more than fluff but gives a good overview of a complex and nuanced political partnership. Jerry Oppenheimer manages to give childhood and marital details without dabbling in pure psychobabble, but this is a beach book and not history---and doesn't pretend to be anything else."
2,An Anti-Clinton Diatribe,"An anti-Clinton diatribe that locates some new sources of information and arrives at negative conclusions about the Clintons as persons, which it states mainly through innuendo. Makes many uncomplimentary comments about the lives of private persons who would, I suspect, rather not be public figures. Does not deal with public policy."
2,Incredulous argument,"Bill and Hillary Clinton's marriage is perhaps the most scrutizized in the world. In this book, Oppenheimer presses his opinion that the Clinton's marriage is held together not by love as in a normal human marriage but by ambition. It is interesting to see how he has put together such a incredulous argument. I have to agree that his argument is logical. However, much of the evidence is unreliable. Such stories as one would find in a supermarket tabloid. It is an interesting but hard to believe perspective?"
1,State of a Union: Or Why Hillary is a Terrible Person,"Seductive in its wily argument, this book gives such a spin-doctored view of Hillary Clinton that it barely qualifies as non-fiction. I say the doctored view is of Hillary, because Bill is a bit player in this book. According to Oppenheimer Hillary was the puppet master all along, keeping Bill in the marriage and adhering to the ""Plan"", a phrase he uses as practically equivalent to the ""Final Solution"". With no real insight into either Clinton, with no evidence except second-hand stories from women also involved with Bill and campaign workers, Oppenheimer concludes that there is no real love in the Clinton marriage, only a power arrangement. As if because two people sharing real world goals precludes love and warmth. A gossipy diatribe full of innuendo and negativity."
3,Incorrect data damages author's credibility,"Okay, so it's a small thing, but on page 92 of the Harper Collins hard-cover edition, the author states that one of Hillary's relatives graduated from Stevens College in COLUMBUS, MISSOURI. NOT! Stephens College is in Columbia, Missouri, which is also the location of the University of Missouri, touted by many, ironically, as the leading journalism school in the country. I really do not understand errors like this. Is it just plain sloppiness or carelessness? In the presence of a stupid mistake like this, are there possible other research mistakes, larger ones, perhaps? I will add that this book, notwithstanding the fact that after page 92, I read with some degree of skepticism, was fundamentally a good read, well organized, informative, and interesting."
1,"This is a very poorly written, boring book.","Although there were great expectations for this book, I found it to be boring, not interesting, and a huge disappointment. It seems to have been written specifically for people with little or no education. Reading it was a tremendous waste of time. Nothing new or fresh was presented, so save your money and read something else."
4,A MUST for your classic hard rock/metal collection!,"Krokus was a Swiss hard rock/metal band that not many took too seriously. They weren't as 'low on the metal totem pole' as let's say Warrant or Trixter, but they had their detractors. Which is a crying shame since Krokus had some truly great songs with excellent 'grit your teeth' guitar riffing and song dynamics. Some of those tunes are on 'Metal Rendez-Vous'. I just had to pick this up on CD, since I had this album, and 'rocked out' to it bigtime in the early 80's. 'Tokyo Nights' and 'No Way' are 2 examples of great, nicely structured rock songs with excellent hard rock guitar riffs, and I could have sworn I even heard Sebastian Bach approve of these guys in a dream I had! Which makes Krokus all right by me! Great band, great CD! I only wish the CD was truly remastered."
1,*yawn*,This movie doesn't look like an up to date space movie. You think they are putting the UFO on a string. Really really badly done. Can Richard Grieco please do something else than this!!?? :)
1,Circuit Breaker,"This movie was too awful to even write about it. Richard Grieco must have needed work at this time. It was not written well. The acting was terrible. Richard, I know you are a good actor. Don't do these stinkers again. You would be good in a science fiction movie if it was a good one."
1,rip off,If you think this is rufus thomas with canned heat as his backing band...much like the hooker n heat lp....your mistaken. This is 10 songs by canned heat that is available on other canned heat cds with much better recordings....and then 10 songs by rufus thomas. Keep your money in your pocket or buy other cds from ... companies....this is a RIP-Off.
1,Old fashioned and slightly boring,"This book gives good advice to girls,but the problem is,the advice they give,would be much more useful for a girl who lived a 100 or 200 years ago.This book is very old fashioned and slightly boring.I wouldn't recommend reading this book unless you were an old fashioned,slightly boring person yourself.Girls these days aren't like they used to be a couple centurys ago,so reading a book that's meant more for a girl who lived long ago,isn't really that much fun.All in all,I think it's too old fashioned."
1,This book put me to sleep..,This book puts me to sleep each time I read it.I think the book has too many old fashioned ideas about how a girl should live her life.The book does a lot of comparing with girls who live a simple life and girls who don't.The way the book presents things is really annoying.I wouldn't recommend reading this book.
1,All Right,"Hi,my name is Carley Adeler.This book was OKAY.It was a little boring,but it was ALL RIGHT.I'd prefer to read a different book any day,but the book wasn't TOO BAD.The book itself was a little old fashioned,so watch out."
2,Karen Andreola's Poor Revision,"I first read this revised edition, and then I went back and read an original unrevised version. Karen Andreola did a poor job in revising Mabel Hale's delightful book ""Beautiful Girlhood."" Frankly, I found her revision to have an unbiblical feminist flare to it that I wouldn't want to encourage in my (future) daughters. To everyone that I recommend ""Beautiful Girlhood"" to I always make a point to have them find an original edition, and avoid Karen Andreola's revised edition. It would have been better to have left well enough alone. =) Look for an unrevised editon--it will be a blessing and delight and well worth the read!"
1,wednesdays have become the worst day of my life,"Like I said, Mom has made me do this and I believe that this is set on principles of the way, way, way olden times and does not at all tie in with the Bible or the real world. I mean, come on, something about see the beauty of yourself inside and how a 'good virtue' is to have a woman that has a smile and how a good woman is like a rose blossoming--you get the idea. What if you don't want to become a lady like they were in the 1900's. What if you don't want to become 'beautiful' like they said, with the big ugly dresses and dancing and knitting and so on. What if you just want to become an author and deck out at home and type? THEN what? You don't have to rely on a hundred-year-old book to guide you through your life. I'll take the Bible instead."
4,tells about how to be feminine,"There is a difference between femineity and feminists, and I want my daughter to learn how to be feminine. Which this book helped with. The book is wrote to about a twelve year old's understanding."
1,Out of date,"I read this book as part of my homeschooling several years back and strongly disliked it. The writing style is pretty archaic and veers toward the preachy quite often and never struck me as charming or whimsical.The content is also questionable and best and harmful at most. Some of the anecdotes are painfully out of date, such as the girl arguing with her mother about hemlines on homemade dresses and such. As a child, I found it difficult to relate the old-world moral lessons to the world in which I was living. So much for being practical.This book includes gems of wisdom including exhortations to not be too friendly with boys and laugh too much at their jokes or they will never want to marry you. Also, all proper godly girls will like the exact same things and if you're not very feminine, well sorry! God only likes girly girls and godly men won't want you. While striving to be a godly woman is an excellent thing, find out about godliness from the Bible."
5,"Great Book That Answers a Daughter's ""Why?"" Questions!!!","Beautiful Girlhood taught me a great deal about how to train my daughters to experience excellence in girlhood; while the companion guide helped build a bridge between our teaching, devotion and application time. With the help of the guide I have not only taken my devotion with God more seriously, but I am also able to teach my girls to do the same, starting at young ages. The questions we discuss are very thought provoking. We now have a plan for allowing God to shape our daughters' character in a very appealing and current way. My daughters are very inquisitive. They ask a lot of questions about life. This books uses stories and illustrations to help explain to girls, God's reasons for conducting ourselves as ladies of excellence. It explains why young girls should help around the house, dress modestly, and obey their parents. A lot of times I refer my girls to the author's explanations instead of just my own!"
