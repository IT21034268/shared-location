2,Lights Out,"Okay, I read all the reviews and still ordered one of these. What was I thinking? Well, I was thinking that the object I wanted to light was going to be fairly close to the spot and that I didn't want it to be lit too brightly. And I liked the design of it as well. With a cool name like ""Bullit"", it's got to be halfway decent, right?Well, it worked fairly well at first. It definitely fulfilled my wish of not lighting the object that it was focused on too brightly, although it had a shorter ""light life"" each evening than my other solar lamps. But then we had a good rain and my buddy the Bullit doesn't appear to be waterproof. It continues to work, but there is so much moisture in it that it condenses on the top of the plastic cover over the solar panel during the day. This limits the panel's exposure to sun and shortens its light life even more...not a good thing."
2,disappointed,The light output is very dim. I wanted to illuminate a flag from a few feet away. It won't illuminate at all.
1,Kinda doesn't light up much nor too long!,"I don't think it's worth the money. I followed the directions to a ""T"" and still its a very faint light and just okay. I think it'd be better to have this Money in my wallet!"
1,"No amount of sun keeps it half the night, don't hate, just disappointed.","I've placed it in many areas hoping to collect enough sun to keep it on all night, like the 3 one dollar ones bought several years ago that will burn all night standing right next to (not shading) the Brinkmann. Not worth the trouble to send back but would not recommend. I do not know if I just got a lemon but out of patience with products not up to their claims. Amazon has taken care of any problems I've taken to them but do not want to be a continual complainer and will suck it up & call it a bad product."
1,Not so good,I bought this solar light to help give solar light to my patio. Only 2 of the three interior lights charge up. So the lighting is so so.
1,WARNING! Do not buy this worthless crap!,I bought four of these and three of them ceased operation after a rain storm one week later. Total waste of money.
3,"Good light, but need more than one","I purchased this light because my back yard is so dark. It's a good light, but not for a yard as big as mine. I will need about 4 more to illuminate my yard. Not a bad price."
3,There must be better products - good but beware!!,"I have bought and used several netcomm products from some big resellar and I have had good and bad experiences. First the good experience: the product works well, initally. Quality sound, reliable, etc. Bad experience: after about 8 or 9 months of use, WAMMMMO!!!, complete failure. The product goes from working and functioning to being a useless piece of junk in less than a second. Since the 30 day warrenty is out I now have to buy a new amplifier to replace the old piece of junk. I previously used a wireless headset and amplifier ($300) which I shelved because of poor reception and also being unreliable. My advice. Do your research and get something with good reviews and recommendations. I would not have too much heartburn about this if the price of components was low but really, I just don't want to be spending $300 to $400 per year on my phone headset."
1,Save your money,"I found this book rather boring. The author's were trying so hard to be funny. This seems to be yet another book sucking the blood out of the dating stereotype out there.I think books like these create a bigger gap between men and women and confuse people further about dating. I bought this book thinking it would be something light and funny to read on a long flight, but I gritted my teeth all the way and finally re -read the chef menu on the aeroplane which I found more delightful."
4,"Good, Basic Information","Even though this book was copywrited in 1994 and revised in 1998, the info is still fresh and new. Pitman uses a mixture of Ayurvedic and Greek-Tibb humours to base her recommended herbs. This is fairly easy to follow with this book. The remedies are obtainable and easy to understand. However, she doesn't give the quantities of the herbs to use. One would have to rely on their intuition or maybe consult another book if you are unsure about measurements. All in all, I enjoyed reading this book and it will definitely be one that I use as a reference as an herbologist."
4,Nice..,"Nice but the size are diferent to the photo it's more bigger, but generally are beautiful. And the ship is very fast."
2,Burns rice,"I purchased this to replace my old rice/veggie steamer and I am so disappointed. It has burned the rice all four times I have used it. I keep increasing the water but to know avail. The only thing that works is cooking the rice. I guess if I want to continue to use it I will have to stand near by to check it occasionally. So much for automatically knowing when the rice is done and the handy ""keep warm"" setting. I may return this to the store yet. I really don't like it."
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"We got this rice cooker as a Christmas gift. We've tried cooking rice in it three times, and all three times the rice has burned. It simply gets too hot. Like some of the other reviewers, we added more and more water, but it didn't help. The cooker finally does kick into ""warm"" mode, but by then it's too late. We were thrilled when we realized it was non-stick, but what good is non-stick when the rice is scorched beyond edible?"
2,BROWN RICE BLEW THERMAL FUSE,"HAD MACHINE FOR 1 1/2 YEARS. TRIED BROWN RICE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND IT BLEW THE THERMAL FUSE INSIDE. HAD PLENTY OF WATER, IT JUST NEVER SWITCHED OVER TO THE WARMING FUNCTION WHEN IT WAS DONE. REPLACED THE FUSE WITH THE SAME RESULTS. POSSIBLE THAT THE SWITCH OVER CIRCUITRY WENT SOUTH. WOULDN'T BUY THIS MODEL AGAIN. THE RICE COOKER WE HAD BEFORE THIS ONE LASTED ALMOST 20 YEARS."
1,Rival RSC200 Fails,On the 3rd use this rice cooker burned the rice because it never went into the 'keep warm' mode. The cooker never worked at all after that. Returned for Refund.
5,Rice Cooker,This rice cooker is a very good product for a very reasonable price. We love the rice it cooks.
2,Doesn't cook rice well,"Bought this to replace an old Panasonic, which had worked like a charm for 18 years (and went off to continue working well at my son's first apartment) - but this one didn't work well right from the start. It leaves rice undercooked, hard and too dry. Even if I add another cup of water, it still doesn't come out softer. The warming mode burns the rice on the bottom of the pot."
1,THE LID EXPLODED,I have had this rice cooker for a while. As I was making rice the other night the handle flew off the lid and across the kitchen. The glass lid exploded all over the place. I am lucky that my 4-year old was not in the kitchen and no one got hurt. This is inexcusable. Do not buy this! It is a kitchen hazard!!!
1,Cooker just died!,"At first the cooker was great and I was excited with it. Then one day, just before one year of use, it just died. No power, nothing.Useless equipment!"
1,Disappointed,"I was shopping for a internal stainless steel Rice Cooker. This model has Teflon inside. To the best of my recollection, it did not state that. Very very disappointed and feel I have been hoodwinked! Not nice to trick Mother."
5,I really liked this vit C! It doesnt upset my stomach,"This organic amla C is really good. I take everyday 2 - 4, before going to work with my meal, together with vit B, Rainbow light organic Men's vit, and Newchapter Organics every man's one daily, no need for coffee, I feel great, and it last for a long time. I will be buying more as soon this bottle is done. If you take it at night, this will keep you up. I take it usually before going to work, around 3pm, and last til 2am."
2,Misleading,"First of all, I LOVE the 650 however I wanted to get the cradle and use the data cable that came with the 650 with a second computer, my notebook. I ordered the cradle and the discription says it comes with a data cable. That is BS, it does not. It conmes with a power supply, which by the way includes all the international voltage adapters which I have no use for and which just add cost. It DOES NOT come with a data cable. It requires that you use the data cable that came with the Treo. That means I have to remove the cable from the cradle and from the neat wire bundle I use and then use it seperatly for my notook. OK, so I will just buy an additional data cable however this product is:1. Misleading as it does not have a data cable I need2. Wasteful as many of us have no need for the included voltage adaptors for places most of us will never use a 650."
1,"Dreadful, connections in the base do not work well.","After a while I managed to get it to charge my Palm, but it took some work. It just won't work for synching with the computer. I have to disconnect the cable from the base and connect it directly to the Palm to synch, so not buying this would be better."
1,Terrible -- 2 died.,"In concept a great device. Cradle and spare battery charger in 1. Unfortunately, there must be something faulty in the connections inside. I've had 2 die on me. And it's not the cable -- that works fine when taken out of the cradle. This is a ripoff."
1,Very disappointed,"I enjoy the Treo 650 a good deal. This cradle, however, is junk. It's already in the trash...I'm not even bothering to return it.I just don't understand product designers. They obviously don't use the products themselves, or they would never make them so badly. This doesn't have any weight to it, despite the fact that the connector is a very snug fit. This means that docking or undocking the Treo is always a 2-handed operation...which is simply inexcusable.Also, the sync capability works about half the time. I've even switched out cables. It's just garbage. Don't buy it. I just bought the Seidio Innodock instead. It's also a 2-handed job (hate that), and the sync button is so small and takes so much pressure to depress that even THAT is a 2-handed operation. But at least it syncs when you hit it.VERY SAD. People who design products should be forced to use them for 60 days before they are released to an unsuspecting public."
1,Didn't work.,"Opened the box, plugged it in, didn't work. No light on cradle, didn't charge my Treo. What a big waste of time. Next time I'm going to trust the low ratings from other reviewers."
1,Cannot Sync & Not easy to remove it!,"I have to return it for a refund because I cannot Sync by pressing the button on the dock, but if I use the cable by itself, then it works fine. Also, it is not easy for me to remove the Treo from the dock."
3,"Works flawlessly, takes some muscle to use",The PalmOne Docking Cradle works great but it takes some force and two hands to get it in and out of the docking cradle. It's more of a Palm Treo design problem when it comes to the complicated connection.
4,Works as orignal,The power supply is much larger than original which may be fit all of the options to. I just wanted a replacement cradle so this was a bit of overkill.
1,whats worse...,"whats worse is when you get it, you cant charge your treo without taking it out of whatever case you have and cant get to the spare battery while the treo is docked. Terrible design. Some people seem to be having USB functionality problems as well.wait for a 3rd party cradle if you can"
4,Great accessory!,"If you have more than one battery for the Treo 700w (or I suppose any of the other listed models) then this is a must-have. It not only comes along with an additional sync and power cable (so your orriginal can be used at work or when traveling), but it has a compartment for charging a second battery.If you have a case for the treo, (I have the Seidio rubber skin) the Treo will not fit in the cradle until you remove the case (which is annoying) but at least I can charge an external battery.It's a well made, heavy device. The cabling has separate connections for power and sync, so you can choose to have one or both connected. The connections are loosely pressure-fit, so if you pull on the cradle to sharply, they fall out."
4,Almost Perfect,"It sometimes fails to hot sync, I have had to reconnect it to get results.It lacks a place for an extra stylus like with the old palm bases, which comes in handy if you use it at the desk.Other than that it is a good product."
3,Palm Treo Accesories,"The accessories were excellent. I do wish that the cradle came as part of the original consignment, and not as an accessory that had to be paid for separately. Quality of the accessories -- Prima! As could be expected from Palm."
5,Great Charger for the Treo 700w,"This was a great purchase and loved dealing with the seller, I was needing this product bad because I use my phone alot! and this charger really came through, I can charge my phone and extra battery."
1,No Sync,I can sync from the USB cable and charge from the cradle but I cannot sync from the cradle and the lite on the front does not come on. I returned the first one and the 2nd one is exactly the same - returning this one also. I do love the phone though.
3,So-So,This book was a little long on words and short on pictures. A good story but not very exciting.
1,everybody doesn't suck like her...,This girl cannot sing. Her song 'If I Open Up My Heart To You' proves that. She's whiney and off key. Her vocals are sad but I guess that's what you get with pop music. Worthless and not worth your money.
2,*~ Umm...*~,Well.. actually I loved the song Everybody Doesnt. Its a great song~ The best on the album by far! But the other songs are.. not that great. She sounds manufactured and her voice is nothing more special than most young teenage female artists out there. In fact I don't think she has that much talent.When I heard Everybody Doesn't I though this girl could be the next thing! After buying the cd I realized different though. I think that single came out about a year ago and she hasn't had any more singles since then. Its not that big of a surprise.She does sound like she has talent in Everybody Doesnt. Maybe if she had some more songs like that she would've been more of a hit. Something about her voice can be a little annoying at times too. Shes not at all horrible but maybe with some practice and new songs she could get back in the music business~But this album won't have any more hits.. That seems the only sure thing for Amanda right now!
1,bleh,"Thought we would get a better chair for what we paid for...Was a gift that mom wanted, but b/c of the quality of the chair not no use whatsoever."
5,Smooth as Butter!,"Purchased a little over a month ago. Had about 20 metal post to remove that had been in the ground for over 10 years. Ground was hard and dry. The unit worked like a dream. Just put the base up next to the post, slipped the u-hook under a lug and then pushed down on the lever bar. Posts just racheted out of the ground!"
2,"Great idea, but not for my fence posts","I tried removing a couple of tee style fence posts with this. They wouldn't budge in the slightest. It looks like it has a good mechanical advantage, but even with my full body weight my posts stood their ground. It looks like I just did too good a job driving them in.P.S. These posts have an arrow shaped blade which made them easier to drive into the ground, but even with the blade dug out this post puller isn't quite up to the job."
3,Good idea but ...,After reading the previous reviews on this I decided to try it for pulling some fence posts on my property. I should of watched a video of it being used first which is on youtube.com. Needless to say the travel on this is only about 2-3 inches so puling a fence post which is 3 feet in to the ground with 60 pounds of concrete on it would not work. I gave it three stars as it did not work in my situation but for T-posts it would probably work great.
2,Lack of directions,"There were no directions sent with this product. I was unable to pull out the first T-post I tried. Maybe it's because these posts have been in place ever since the earth-mover cleared this lot, about 7 years ago; also, we have clay-like soil here in the Piedmont area of NC. Oh well, bring in the earth-mover again!"
5,very well built,"when I received this item I was shocked at how well built it was. The flange that grabs the t-post is very thick, probably half an inch of steel. There is also a hook attached to the flange for attaching a cable or chain to pull other types of posts. The foot of the post puller also has a small hole where you can attach a board or larger base material if you are on soft, soupy ground. I have used it twice and the t-posts come out very easily. So far I think it is much better than I expected."
3,Removing metal stakes,"Had to remove 6 6-foot metal stakes driven into hard ground far enough so that the flange [sometimes called the 'wing'] was below ground level. Was able to reomove only 4. Problem was not gaining sufficient purchaseon the stake; i.e the gripping end of the puller kept slipping up the back side of the stake.Note: Some stakes [not mine] have burrs welded on one side that would, I believe, definitely catch thegripping end of the puller. Mine have small hooks punched out of the main shaft."
5,great tool,"This tool works flawlessly. Pulled about 20 posts in 15 minutes, most were totally entwined in weeds and in hard clay. Well worth the money. Highly recommend"
5,Worth the money. Awesome product!,"Maasdam Pow'R Pull PP100, Post Pull'RMy husband and I needed to install our new wood fence as quickly as possible. We shopped around our local ""big box"" and other stores and couldn't find a single fence post puller. We had a variety of existing posts that we needed to pull. Some t-posts and some existing rotted wood buried at least 3 feet. This puller and the additional combo of the chain (very important you buy both if you are dealing with mixed posts) made fence post pulling a breeze. Since we couldn't find something local as soon as we needed it. I mentioned Amazon. We can't tell you how glad we are that we purchased this product (with chain for the wood posts). The price was right and we received our order one day prior to the due day (prime membership). Great product and worth every penny. Thanks Amazon!"
5,CLASSIC SPANISH CUISINE,"Having a Spanish born husband and son-inlaw, I can assure you this book is authentic to the bone without being complicated. Pure classic Spanish food with mostly simplye ingredients for every day cooking."
4,Buena seleccion de temas!!!,"Este es un album del cual tenia canciones sueltas, pero la verdad es muy bueno la canción bonus vale la pena!!! Buena seleccion de temas lo más representativo."
5,"The ""Ultimate Aaliyah"" collection","This ""Ultimate Aaliyah"" collection is a must buy. It contains 2 cds and one dvd. This is a great collection. this set features 24 great Aaliyah hits and one of the most touching tributes ever, ""Hold On"" By Timbaland, Wyclef Jean, and Magoo. That song can make any Aaliyah fan cry. It was just so beautiful. the dvd is also great. It is an extended version of VH1's ""Behing the Music"" Aaliyah Special (It was edited on tv to air commercials) with interviews with P Diddy, Missy Elliott, Her brother Rashad, Gladys Knight, Usher, Mary J Blige and others. This is a must buy. This is the ""Ultimate Aaliyah"" collection for the ""Ultimate Aaliyah"" fan."
2,Not that great,"My boys love trains. The stories in this book are a little dry and not very interesting. Nothing exciting to really strike a toddlers imagination. Just my opinion, but I don't look forward to reading this book to my boys. They do get a kick out of finding the little duck on each page though."
5,great fun for 2,"My kids play this all the time, weather its having friends over or just us, they have a good time playing and the darts are soft so no one gets hurt when they get hit. It will keep them busy for a long time. Its funny to see a kid running around with a dart hanging off his bullseye..."
3,"Easily overlooked, but troublesome flaw","This gun has one extremely irritating flaw...The darts are designed to stick to the vest. However, the darts may stick to the vest while they are still in the gun. Not only does this result in you shooting blanks, it looks like somebody shot you quite a few times."
4,Toy works well be careful if you have smaller kids,"My son got this toy and loves it. He is 8. The gun works almost too well in my opinion. The darts shoot really fast. I always make sure he keeps the safety glasses on while playing (they are included in with the guns). My son loves to play with these with his friends/family. Now that it is winter, and it has to be played inside, I always make sure any smaller children are out of the way. This toy is not meant for children under 5 and it is hard for smaller children to understand why they can't play. My only change would be that the gun didn't shoot so hard(it hurts if you ever get hit with the darts)."
5,"An old, somewhat obscure book on superstition","Written in 1918, this is another early book on the topic of superstition, like Johnson's ""What They Say in New England"" and Bergen's ""Current Superstitions"" -- both published in 1896. This book is also like those in size, not overly extensive at around 150 pages. Unfortunately the author gives no sources, so unlike Bergen's well-known books on superstitions; we have no idea where these came from specifically. This book, unlike many books with references is a little more readable than the longer, more ""scholarly"" works on superstition which often just list the beliefs -- here we get a little more context. I would recommend this somewhat obscure book primarily to those with a deeper interest in this subject."
1,I've never had batteries die so quickly,"I went through this entire pack of batteries in about a month as they have all rapidly died on me. One by one, each battery operated item I have put the batteries in has failed for lack of power about 75% faster than each should have. Not worth the hassle."
3,Not too hot,"Purchased these in March '09 for a few solar spotlights that are the equivalent of a 150 watt spotlight bulb each. Just last month when I purchased them, they were several $ less. After putting these in the solar lights and 'charging' the lights for 5 nice, sunny days, only 1 light 'worked' right: the other 3 were hardly visible. Not having any other batts on hand, I tried replacing with more from this same box. I got 2 more lights to work but they were extremely dim: the 4th remains stubborn and resembles a firefly's last dance. Next time, even if I have to pay more, I'll go with a brand I know and trust. These were a great 'deal', but the extra work I had in changing the batteries in the solars time and again and then adjusting the solars to shine in the right direction just wasn't worth it."
3,Package broken,"The outer box was broken when the item arrived. Fortunately, the batteries inside have plastic wrap so they were in good condition."
1,Defective Batteries,"I installed 6 of these batteries in an LED light I had and they seemed to work well. When I tried to turn on the light 15 minutes later it did not work. I opened the battery compartment and found that 3 of these batteries had split open and had deposited an oily liquid in the battery compartment. Because the battery splits had just occurred I was able to clean up the mess with no damage the light. Cheap batteries or not, this still should not have happened."
2,Not good for high-drain devices,"I've used these in my pager with OK results; they would probably be OK in wall clocks or flashlights, but they are lousy in digital cameras. I tried some in myOlympus D-580 4MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoomand I was able to take maybe 3 or 4 pictures before the camera thought the batteries were dead. If I waited a while, it could take a few more pictures.I dug out my voltmeter, and it confirmed it. These batteries went from 1.6 volts down to 1.4 volts after a few shots in the camera. After 30 minutes, they recovered to 1.5 volts. The same test with standard Everready alkaline batteries dropped the voltage to only 1.5 volts, plenty of picture-taking power left, and they recovered back to 1.6 volts."
2,"Good Battery, Bad Price",These batteries recently sold in the same value pack for about $7.00FOR SOME REASON THE PRICE HAS NEARLY TRIPLED.I hope the listed price is an error which will be corrected soon.
3,Not a fan,"I get that there are all varying degrees of parent behavior. But, I didn't like the idea that you ""have to find a way to live with your parent's distructive behavior."" I don't think that you have to accept it. I didn't like the vague and not so vaguge suggestions to do so."
4,The title of the book is very descriptive of the text,"For those who have suffered for years and not found help because not much was known and the illness had no name until the last 25-30 years, this is a very practical handbook."
4,"Helpful, insightful, and interesting",This is a really great book that gives a lot of insight into the thought processes and actions of a borderline individual. Very helpful.
5,Excellent introspection,"If you have a parent with BPD this is a must read. It requires your time and energy, but it's really worth the effort. This book gave me the courage and the tools to continue a relationship with my BP mother. If I had not taken the time to read it and do all the exercises in this book I would not have a relationship with her today."
5,Help for Dealing with a Difficult Parent,"Not sure what was wrong with my relationship with my mother, but suspecting BPD, I read this book in 2 days. It is the only book I've read that offers practical advice for dealing with difficult people, especially the overbearing, moody, and negative parent. This book was my saving grace and I have given it to friends who also have difficult family members. I can't say enough about the positive change this book has brought, helping me create boundaries and be able to communicate effectively and respectfully. It has also helped me, as a borderline mother myself, not make the same mistakes my mother did."
5,This book is so healing!,"I am a 39 year old woman who has been living with confusion about my childhood all of my life. This book is exactly what I've needed, I wish I read it 20 years ago. Reading the stories of other survivors has been so healing. My feelings are normal, as far as having grown up with a mother with BPD! I can't say enough about how much this book means to me!!!"
1,Superficial generalities,"This book summarizes the work of others and presents their findings as a setof lists. It then gives a series of pep talks concerning self worth. I have an adult brother with BPD and none of the recommendations are relevant. My brother has abused his spouse and his children. He hates his grandchildren and expressly lets them know of his dislike. In the face of a continuing barrage of abuse and threats, the only solution in my opinion is to cauterize the relationship--cut all contact take out a peace bond if necessary change your phone number, emsil address, etc. That is admit that the person is cruel, dishonest and manipulative and there is not treatment for this condition. This book touches on acceptance, forgiveness and dealing with the person with BPD. This only continues the torture."
3,No personal experience...,"I definitely appreciate the fact that an author finally recognized the issue of having a borderline parent. However, you can tell the author is simply a good author...that's it. She has no personal experience to speak from nor is she a therapist of any sort...at least this is the impression I get. Reducing signs/symptoms, outcomes, probable causes and such in bullet points kinda reduces it to a cold or flu. I found other books to be more helpful HOWEVER this would be a great book if you're just beginning your research."
4,"Delightful, first time reader of Grisham",I never read a John Grisham book before until my friend gave me this to read last week. I got it done in one night and enjoyed it. I felt like I knew the characters and how they reacted to certain incidents very well. I would read it again around Christmas time next year.
1,Surpassing Mr. Scrooge!,"Sorry, John. You wrote such an unredeemable character that I could never begin to root for him. Luther (and his family) is so far above it all that one hopes it all comes crashing down. He ""disses"" everyone from his secretary to his neighbors to the police to the firefighters ... even Scrooge had respect for hard-working people! Then, in the end, sure enough he chickens out. What a coward! And in the last chapter it is revealed, ""Luther hates cats."" Now, there's a surprise!"
1,This is really a mystery...,"John Grisham has finally written an old fashioned mystery, or I should say, a series of mysteries contained in one story:Did he really write this superficial tripe?Will people (like me) continue to buy anything with his name on it?Does his publisher have any shame?How in the world can anyone give this book five stars?"
1,"Flat, flat, flat!","Like other reviewers, I had great expectations from this book. Not just because it's a Grisham work. The first several chapters set the stage for a fantastic, groundbreaking story. The very thought that one couple's idea to go out of town for Christmas would cause such a stir is, indeed, hilarious.Once the fantastic stage is set, however, everything goes downhill. Near the beginning of the story -- as the adventure begins -- it's easy to sympathize (and empathize) with the characters. At the end, frankly, I couldn't wait for them to shut up, celebrate the holiday their own way, and tell their lousy neighbors to butt out.You don't need to have your lawn and house aglow to Celebrate the holiday. You don't need a tree in your house. You just need your family. And that's the message I was hoping would be intrinsic to this dog of a book. Oh well. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. Ptooey."
2,'Skipping Grisham',"When you picked up a Grisham book until before last year, you anticipated edge of the seat excitment and a fastpaced, masterful courtroom drama. Not so now!I am disappointed with Grisham. Why throw away the good will he has built over the years? People are still reading this book out of habit of picking up the latest Grisham, but it is nowhere as good a read as his previous books. The length is disappointing too for the price. The story is stale and the book certainly does not deserve to be on the best seller lists. This one is purely commercial folks! Coming right at Christmas Time too! Just a very average book that would have gone unnoticed had it been written by another less well known author.If you love the original Grisham, Skipping Christmas then, is a book to skip altogether."
5,Grisham Strikes Again,"In my opinion Grisham has written a brilliant novel. I'm sure in the next years it will become a award winning movie played by some of the biggest actors in this business. Grisham starts off by showing reality of everyday life and of a normal family having a hard time dealing with their daughter leaving for Christmas, but it ends up portraying this perfect image of the perfect Christmas in this perfect town. This is a great book and shows the ups and downs of Christmas times."
3,"A light, easy read","Its important when you read this to know what you're getting into. This book doesn't try to be profound, so if you're looking for a Charlie Brown-like treatise on the commercialism of Christmas, don't bother. And there is no murder, no lawyers, or runaway juries. Its just fun. I read it in one sitting and although I must confess to some annoyance at the ending (no trick ending--I swear!) it was very okay. It was nice to see a more humorous side to Grisham!"
1,"skip this book, please","Not Grisham, absolutely not Grisham.....Totally predictable, characters are not your everyday neighbors, where does Grisham live? If you need some uplifting, go see ""It's a wonderful life"""
2,Skipping Christmas: Falling Short,"Looking to Grisham to provide scintillating holiday reading, I was disappointed in SKIPPING CHRISTMAS. The plot was plastic, the characters were shallow, and the usual satisfaction that comes from reading one of his titles was absent. I had to check that it was the same John Grisham who wrote this."
5,Skipping Christmas by John Gisham,"John Gisham's skipping christmas was a wonderful book full of laughter.It all starts with the Kranks daughter Blair deciding she is going to eastern peru for christmas to teach children how to read.She is a smart,sweet,helpful,loving daughter.Luther (the father)is a funny off the wall kind of guy and he and is wife, Nora decide to skip christmas and go on a ten day cruise.Nora is your typical mom trying to impress the neighbors.The street they live on (Hemlock) is very into christmas, and they always have competitions with the other neighborhoods.Every house has a ton of lights and a frosty on the roof.Not this year the Kranks are the only ones with no frosty or lights.Nora is stressing out about skipping christmas.I like this book a lot because it is funny.It is the kind of book you cannot put down.I suggest this book from fith grade to an adult.I LOVED IT AND YOU WILL TO."
4,Skipping Christmas,I thought this book was hilarious! I felt for the poor guy in the book knowing how sometimes Christmas can become ridiculous and not focusing on the things that it is supposed to be about.
4,Great holiday book,John Grisham gives us a holiday thriller. Nora and Luther decide to skip Christmas when their daughter leaves for Peru. Luther books a trip for a cruise in the Carribean when an unexpected visitor is received.
1,Predictable and boring - a soap opera,"If you want a mindless holiday read, third grade level vocabulary, where you can predict the happy soap opera type ending within the first chapter, this is a good pick for you. Otherwise don't waste your time or money. There are too many good books out there."
4,"Very funny, easy book to read","I really enjoyed this departure for John Grisham (his books are usually court related). I found it enjoyable and very easy to read while my wife was shopping. We were spending the ""winter"" in Florida. After reading the book, we watched the video! I thought the book was better!"
5,Enjoyed reading this Christmas Story,I really enjoyed reading this story. This is how I am sure many people feel about the Christmas in things that have to be done. Was there some meaning to the character that was introduced late in the book - Martin. I was not sure what this person had to do with the family or Christmas to them. This book will be out for my whole family to enjoyed this Christmas.
5,LAUGHING OUT LOUD,"As I began this book I found it amusing. But as I read on the book became hilarious. It was so refreshing to find a book that I didn't want to put down that had me laughing so hard at some points I couldn't see through the tears. Grisham has written a totally different type of book and has proven he is without a doubt an excellent author, this time writing a book both entertaining and funny"
1,No Good...,"This book is not up to John Grishman quality. Although it was actually interesting throughout the first 3/4 of the book, after that it really tapers off. The last part of the book really drops off and makes it worse."
4,funny,This book was a light/quick read! It was a bit repetitive but that helped set up the zinger to come. This book should have someone write a screenplay staring Steve Martin and Diane Keaton.... you can just imagine them in the two lead roles asyou read this funny novel. enjoy!
2,Also Not Impressed,"I agree with Susan from Florida. This book is pretty lame. I thoroughly enjoyed Grisham's legal thrillers, and have read all that he's written. But the writing in this one is not up to par."
2,Not worth the time.,"I usually enjoy his books, but I was disappointed with this one. The plot just seemed to repeat itself over and over until I grew quite bored. I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen and it never did. I wouldn't recommend to anyone."
4,Cute story,"This is a cute story, and well written, as are all of Grisham's works. If you're looking for something short and sweet, particularly around the holiday season, it does the trick. I found the plot a little farfetched at times, though, and do wish that I'd gotten it from the library rather than as a free literary group selection. I was anxious to read, but now feel like I wasted my choice, and should have gotten a more substantial and thought-provoking book."
1,Not so Inspiring - I expected more from a talented writer...,"A clever thought, poorly executed. I would have preferred a different ending, rather than a traditional Christmas one that we find in ""It's a wonderful Life"" and ""A Christmas Story"". Maybe it would be considered black humor, then, but hey, why not go out on a limb and try something new?I've read a few of John's books, great page turners, false drama created by not telling us who the ""evil"" person behind the story is. And then in one chapter, the person is exposed, and whammo, its over. Nonetheless, I enjoyed those books and that's what counts!This one, however, was just too stereotypical, predictable, and after a while downright tiresome. I really enjoyed the first half of the book because it exposes the mass consumerism rampant during the holidays, something we all should reflect upon.I say, read the first half, until their daughter calls from Florida, and then toss it."
2,"I love John Grisham, but...","This is far below his best work. Gisham is in his element writing about lawyers. A Painted House, while given great reviews, wasn't nearly as good as his gripping legal suspense novels. I must say that Skipping Christmas should be skipped. It might have been all right as a short story, but as a novel, I kept wondering when it would get interesting. It never did. Buy any other Grisham book, but don't buy this one."
2,Just plain not good,"I normally enjoy John Grisham's books, but I really didn't like this one at all. I'm actually surprised to see so many people liked it. The book seemed more like a sad attempt at a screenplay for the next beloved Christmas film (along the lines of National Lampoon's Christmas), but everything was so cliched and easy-to-see-coming that it would make a terrible movie. Plus, everyone cared way too much that the ""Kranks"" (please!) were skipping Christmas, to the point of not even being fun-fiction-believable. I would recommend skipping this book."
2,Skipping Christmas: a novel,"John Grisham obviously needed some fast cash. This is poorly written, and very lightweight subject matter. Not at all up to his usual standards."
1,Sorry I couldn't Give It Zero Stars,"I kept waiting for it to get interesting. The only thing it was, was predictible."
2,Depressing,"I have not read any other Grisham book so I had no expectations when I bought it. Fortunately it was short and an easy read so I was able to finish it in a couple of days. I read the book a few days after Christmas and it just reminded me of all the craziness of the holidays which by then I had conveniently forgotten. The prevailing of the Christmas spirit at the end of the story was certainly not enough to justify the long ""adventure"" leading up to it. All in all, the story was depressing."
1,Don't Buy This Book,That this book has been hyped to the top of the best seller lists is further depressing evidence of the decline of western civilization.
2,Skip Skipping Christmas,I have read each of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed all...until now. Humor writer he ain't!
3,Our Ninth Reading Selection,"Skipping Christmas was our December 2002 Festive Reading Selection.This is a book where our members varied in opinions a lot. While some of our members loved the book and thought it was funny while others didn't care for the main character or thought the this book didn't live up to Grisham's writing abilities.The majority of our members did like the storyline and loved the fact that Nora and Luther wanted to take a year off of the hustle and bustle of the Holidays to take a cruise. We all basically thought that their neighbors were rude and inconsiderate and some of us didn't think the ending was realistic.When we polled the members for a rating, the lowest and more common was 3/5 but we did have one member that rated this book 5/5. Our average rating for this book was a 3.5/5, but for Amazon purposes I have listed it as a 3/5."
1,Skipping Christmas,"I wish Grisham had skipped writing this, the publisher had skipped publishing it and most certainly that I had skipped reading it. One of, if not THE worst books I have ever come across. I would advise anyone to skip reading it even if they were offered payment to do otherwise!"
2,"Light, Formulaic, Predictable","This book seems like something Grisham whipped together in a week to release just before the Christmas season last year. Granted it worked out wonderfully for him, another #1 bestseller, but this is a short one-day read, nothing groundbreaking.Grisham fans will likely pick this one up, but what you get for what you pay is a tragedy. At 176 pages this one may never see the light of paperback. It's not a bad book by any means, but certainly not the most stimulating."
1,Ridiculous!,"The only reason I gave this book 1 stars is because it was light reading.It's amazing that you can put Grisham's name on a book and throw a title into it with the word ""Christmas""...release it after Thanksgiving, and lo and behold...it's a best seller!Who said marketing is dead in America?? Very dull book that could have been written by my 14 year old!"
1,A sad commentary on American Christmas,"As I was reading this depressing, stressful book, I couldn't help but think about what people outside the US must think of us and the way we prepare for Christmas. Everybody was so mean to each other or envious. The Krank marriage was a bore. Their lives were so mundane. I especially hated the stressful times the Kranks had as they were preparing for their daughter's arrival. Did the mother make the caramel pies or not???Fortunately I rented this book from the library. Has John Grisham had a lombotamy?"
4,Take time out of the holidays to read this book!,"Luther and Nora are experiencing empty nest syndrome and at the holidays, it is even worse. Their only daughter Blair has went to work for the Peace Corps in Peru. Since Luther is an accountant he decides to tally up how much money is spent on Christmas each year. He discovers that last year they spent $6100 on it and have nothing to show for it. He convinces Nora to 'skip Christmas' by taking a cruise and not partaking in all of the usual holiday events.The people that they encounter as they try to skip Christmas is hilarious. These people in this town are just looney over Christmas.I really enjoyed this book. This is the first John Grisham book that I have ever read. While I know that it is nothing like his law thrillers, I was impressed with the story. It was a short and quick read and perfect for that holiday read."
4,A Summer Read,"Forget trying to analyze this novel-- enjoy it. This book is entertaining and takes just a short time to read. My stomach hurt because I was laughing so hard. Perhaps this book created so much enjoyment for me because my husband is an accountant. That, or I was ready for a light book that would make me laugh. Regardless, avoid analyzing the materialistic/traditionalistic/religous messages that could be discerned from this book, and just read it!"
2,A Big Disappointment,"Skipping Christmas is well-written and has a few amusing moments. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the book.A more obnoxious group of characters I never hope to meet, with the possible exception of Luther himself. (His daughter and her boyfriend are nice, but they only appear at the very end of the story). Nora is totally disgusting. How could any man stay married to her? And the shallow stupidity of the neighbors! Even the woman with cancer is unsympathetic.Luther should have skipped the whole lot of them and joined his daughter in the Peace Corps."
1,Big disappointment for this John Grisham fan,"Not funny - whiney and annoying. By half way through I was so tired of the rude neighbors and other assorted characters and feed up with the whiney tone of the Kranks. I kept thinking ""So get on the stink'n plane and go away for crying outloud"". Sorry, I normally am easily amused, but if this was supposed to be humorous I certainly didn't laugh."
1,"Skipping ""Skipping Christmas""","I thought this book had such potential. It started out with the unique and unheard of idea of skipping Christmas because of the expenses, busy shopping malls, phonyness and shallowness that our culture has turned Christmas into. I was really enjoying the story until Luther and his wife buckled under the pressure of their daughter coming home for the holidays and succumbed to the very idea that they were so against previous to her phone call. This was a big disappointment!"
1,Unworthy of toilet paper.,"This is the most meandering,unimaginative,vomit inducing ""novel"" that I have ever been forced to endure. I say force for my goodnatured parents found a loophole for enforcing cruel and unusual punishment and it is ""Skipping Christmas"" by John (...) Grisham.I can denouce this book even after having read ""Nothing but the Truth"". It's about some whiny simp named Luther Krank who hates christmas and loves white chocalte (...). Nothing more should be said about this repetive plot and Grisham's writing style which is about as imaginative as a manuel for a dishwasher. (...)"
1,Skip This Book,"If you are expecting the depth of character and story line of a typical John Grisham novel, you are going to be sadly mistaken. This is an absolutely inane book based on petty, self-absorbed, small-minded characters in a ridiculously overbearing neighborhood. This book is far from funny, if that's what it's supposed to be. I couldn't force myself to even finish this extremely small (in many ways) book. Save your money and buy yourself something else for Christmas."
1,Drek,"This is one of the most irritating books I have ever read. It is completely without artistry, totally predictable, and packed with the kind of characters that make life in America seem hopeless and embarrassing.It is a depressing and shallow book. No wonder our children don't bother to learn to read or write. Why bother? Might as well just go see a movie. Buy a good meal or a house plant instead of this book."
4,Fun book for a plane ride,Good book for a plane ride. Just about the right length to finish on a flight. Light entertainment.
4,easy pleasant reading with a surprise ending,"If you need a book to relax with in front of the TV...one which won't scare you or make it tough to sleep then this is a good candidate. It's very funny and if you are a middle-aged average American, then you'll be able to identify with the problems neighbors can bring. It really is amazing the difficulty skipping Christmas presents and they almost manage it perfectly....almost."
1,GRISHAM ???,"I CHECKED THE COVER MORE THAN ONCE JUST TO SEE IF SOMEONE OTHER THAN JOHN GRISHAM WROTE THIS. PAINTED HOUSE, LIKE SKIPPING CHRISTMAS, WAS A DEPARTURE FROM THE LEGAL THRILLERS (WHICH I WILL ALWAYS WELCOME) THE DIFFERENCE BEING THAT PAINTED HOUSE WAS A GOOD READ. READING THIS NOVEL ABOUT WHITE-BREAD PEOPLE IN A WHITE-BREAD SUBURB AND ALL THE NONSENSE THAT GOES ON BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T TELL A SIMPLE TRUTH (TO THEIR OWN CHILD !) WAS LIKE WATCHING A LEAVE IT TO BEAVER RERUN. DO PEOPLE LIKE THIS REALLY EXIST ? WILL THE REAL JOHN GRISHAM PLEASE STAND UP !"
5,Skipping Christmas is a very entertaining read!,"I so enjoyed reading this one and I am not an avid fan of John Grisham. This was funny and I couldn't wait to get back home,from my Christmas shopping sprees, to pick it back up again. I didn't want it to come to an end. I dare anyone to read this and not be just a little bit tempted to do the same thing that Luther wanted to do. I'm still considering it myself for next year. Don't hesitate to buy this one and get an extra one to give as a present. It's good for many laughs and the story wraps up well. Just a little Christmas humor there.Grisham may want to consider writing comedy for a while. I read somewhere that odds are this one will be a made-for-televison movie by next year. Merry Christmas readers!!"
4,Skipping Christmas,"I laughed...and isn't it a wonderful life to be able to do that. It wasn't a deep story, it wasn't rocket science, it was just a fun book to read. And couldn't we all recognize some of the materialistic rituals that have become a part of Christmas that we all despise and wish we could say ""No, we're skipping Christmas this year"". I may do that next year...and hopefully I make the cruise."
1,A new low for Grisham,"Trite, predictable characters. Predictable plot. Sugar-sweet ending. Just a waste of time and money.I should add that I really like Grisham as a writer, despite the sometimes formulaic approach. He's readable and entertaining. This one stinks, though. He should be embarrassed to publish this under his own name."
2,Waste of Time,"With the talent that John Grisham possesses in his ability to write a great mystery novel, this story is silly and much beneath him and his skills. I found it a time waster and I regret the money I paid to purchase it. Mr. Grisham -- stick to what you do best!"
1,Skip the book--,"i'm shocked that so many people enjoyed this book. I found it poorly written, predictable and redundent. If you are considering reading this book spend some time reading the people who gave it only one star. They seem to have a clear handle on why it's not worth your time reading this book."
1,A painfully predictable screenplay,"As if we needed any further proof that Grisham's a hack, he took a break from writing formulaic legal thrillers to grind out this thinly-veiled screenplay in which a caricatured pair of middled-aged empty-nesters decide to beg out of Christmas. Hilarity ensues with painful predictability."
1,Can't imagine?!?,I can't imagine why anyone would find this story worth reading. Throughout the book I continually anticipated something that never came about. By the end of the story I felt let down.
3,Save money. Just read the reviews.,"I don't understand why people think that one must re-tell the story to express an opinion. If I had read some of these reviews before I purchased the book, I never would have purchased it. But I guess that's just me. I pick up a book and expect to read a story I don't already know.I enjoyed the novel in the beginning, but as the story progressed, it not only became a bit absurd, it became transparent. The end was absolutely no surprise; I saw it coming very early on.The characters are pretty flimsy and often cartoonish, which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but compounded with a predictable ending you get the formula for a silly romp. Not my cup of tea but I applaud Grisham's change of pace and the subject matter."
2,Not worth the money,"Yes, this book was well written, however it can hardly be called a novel. It is more of just a longer short story with a very simple plot. This novel is also very short providing only a day or two of reading. All in all this book is definatly not worth all the money. I would reccomend buying another book to fill your time."
4,enjoyable,"This is not one of his serious mysteries, but a fun one about a couple who decides to skip all the hoopla of Christmas because their daughter isn't going to be home for it this year. They decided that they would use the money for a trip instead. They run into all sorts of censorship and problems from their neighbors and everyone over the deal. It is quite entertaining. Buy the book if you want something that is light to read and leaves you smiling."
4,Anna's Favorite Christmas Book,"Skipping Christmas is a funny and short book about Nora and Luther, an older couple. When their daughter goes off to South America with the Peace Corps, Luther wonders how much money they spend on Christmas. He crunchers numbers for days and finally comes up with a huge amount. He decides that this year, they will skip all the Christmas festivities and go on a cruise instead. Luther believes this is a full proof plan because it will only be himself and Nora home for Christmas, and the will miss all the crowds, stress, and putting up the dreaded Frosty on the top of the roof. He picks a wonderful cruise that sounds like paridase. He and Nora go to the tanning salon and both get nice tans in the middle of the winter. Will their plan work? Read the book to find out! I know you will love it!"
5,"skip the others, read this book!","Loved this book. I read it a year ago and laughed and cried. It will be standard holiday reading each year. To me, Luther Krank wanted to do what most of us only dream about...skip Christmas just for once. I loved the neighbors - we all have a Fromeyer in our neighborhoods... I laughed out loud at the scene of Luther trying to hastily get the Snowman up. I wish I could tell Grisham to ignore all the nay-sayers and let him know that it was a marvelous and touching holiday story. Love, love, love this book!"
1,We're All Human,"I hate to do this, because I'm a huge Grisham fan, but this book is a bore. The only reason I finished it is because it was short, and I was trying to kill time on a flight. This wasn't because it's not a ""classic"" Grisham tale - I enjoyed ""A Painted House"" - but rather it just seemed uninspired.You never feel a connection with the two main characters, Luther and Nora, so when the story starts what I suppose is intended to be its climax, you just don't care. After finishing this book, I felt like I had just watched a bad sitcom Christmas special. I'm a huge Grisham fan, and would have given a mediocre book my full support, but this was just dull. Oh well, we're all human, and this is definitely the exception to an otherwise great collection of work."
5,'Skipping Christmas' cannot be skipped!,"Skipping Christmas has got to be one of the funniest books I've ever read. You'll be laughing the whole way through at the dispense of poor Luther, who is sick of everything Christmas. He hates traffic, presents, ham, turkey, parties, fruit cake, and decorations. All he wants is to skip Christmas altogether. An amazing accomplishement for Grisham. A Must-read book!"
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","If this message saves just one person from reading this book, then I know I have done my job. What a waste of time. It has a truly predictable plot and ""seen that, done that"" story line. It is almost as if John Grisham was going for the make a few million when turned into yet another cheesy holiday movie plot. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK...PLEASE!!!"
1,A huge disappointment,"I was so disappointed in this book. I saved it until closer to Christmas, wanting to read a holiday book. But this book does NOT feel like a holiday book at all. I couldn't find anything to like about any of the characters. Everyone in this book spends FAR too much time worrying about what everyone else does and what everyone else thinks of them. Grow up and stop worrying about that garbage!It was also very predictible. I just kept waiting and wondering which little hitch would cancel the cruise plans. And the way it was done was ridiculous -- if your daughter is old and mature enough to got to another country AND be engaged, she's old enough to handle the fact that her parents (GASP!) made plans without her. The idea that she could never find out that they had planned to skip Christmas and go on a cruise was ridiculous. Aren't parents allowed to have lives away from their grown children?Skip this one! Maybe Grisham should stick to lawyers?"
1,Am I reading the same book?,"I suspect that Grisham needed a few extra bucks for Christmas spending as this newly published attempt at fiction appears to be a rush job. SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is unworthy of his writing talents. Obviously it will reach the top of the 10 Best, but it arrives there only because of his prior books.My conclusion? A total waste of time.Bah humbug!"
1,Christmas spirit?,"In ""Skipping Christmas"" Grisham is totally unrealistic about how any normal person or community might react because one couple decide to go on a cruise. The reaction of the community was, I thought, very mean spirited and totally lacking in the true meaning of Christmas. To not advise their daughter of their plans is also totally unrealistic. While this was a mildly pleasant ""read"" I found it predictable and drawn-out. Though a short book, I found myself wanting the author to get to the point. Even the ending does not make you feel that it is a community of which you would want to be a part. Skip ""Skipping Christmas"" and reread Barbara Robinson's, ""The Best Christmas Pageant Ever"""
4,Is Steve Martin available??,"A quick, hilarious read that screams MOVIE. Steve Martin would be perfect as Luther."
2,less than average,"since i have read all of grishams other books, i felt obligated to read this one. i am glad that it wasn;t too long because it seemed less than average in terms of grishams typical style. i think that he has a knack for writing, but i think he is better in writing the suspenseful type of books rather than the non suspenseful types...this is a pleasant enough story but nothing to write home about or tell others about...(although i guess that is what i am doing?)"
4,Great Book To Get You Back Into Christmas,"A nice book to get you back into the spirit of Christmas, not totally 100% as good as the usual law type books He (Grisham) writes, but a nice little book for Christmas."
2,This is not a good book,"I expected a light read, but did not expect to be annoyed by this book! There are many reasons why someone would choose (or wish) to skip Christmas, and many reasons why it would be almost impossible in our culture. Grisham, however (or whoever wrote this, it isn't up to Grisham standards), only considers one (the materialistic excesses) and sets his scenes with a cartoon-like quality. The first half is entertaining, but both the author and the character cave in to society's expectations, falling flat in attempts to express something about the ""real meaning of Christmas."" I was hoping this book might expand on the idea that there are as many expressions of the ""real meaning"" as there are Christians, and illustrate how one man searched for his own. Alas.... Maybe next year."
5,"Not-so-Grishamy, but still a good read","I got this book because I loved the jacket. My copy has a Christmas tree on it, red background. Anyway, I was so intrigued with how this couple would accomplish skipping Christmas that I didn't stop until I finished the entire book. Well okay, it took me two days to finish it because it was at the height of Christmas when I read it. It was a relax read and I had a good couple of laughs. I guess that's what I needed to relax and feel Christmas... and realized that Christmas should never be skipped... ever.I've recommended this book to my friends and told them not to expect the typical Grisham book. It's light... a perfect breather from our busy lives."
1,Skip Skipping Christmas,"Garbage. Pure and simple.Poorly written. Lousy plot. Cynical curmudgeon decides he and the wife will skip Christmas, going on a cruise instead. He considers his neighbors are dolts or scam artists-- including the fire department. Then the daughter, doing volunteer work in South America, decides to come home for Christmas-- with her new husband. Daughter springs this on curmudgeon and wife on Christmas Eve. There will be no skipping Christmas this year! They must make a traditional Christmas for her, even though the whole world is closed for business. The neighbors come to the rescue, ala ""It's a Wonderful Life"". And curmudgeon re-discovers the meaning of Christmas. Garbage!Don't waste your money.If you want a really good book, read ""Peace Like a River"" by Leif Enger. Though it is not a Christmas book persay, it has a Christmas scene in it that will genuinely spark your spirit. You will enjoy it."
1,Skip this book,"What started as a lighthearted and thought provoking account of the commercialism of the Christmas season, ended with a too tidy wrapping addressed to ""Hollywood - make me an offer."" Grisham's sudden entry of the Peruvian boyfriend and the concerns of the Kranks is simply too strange and distracting for this holiday plot, no matter how supposedly sarcastic its intent. Skip this waste of talent."
3,A Simple Read to Kill a Short Amount of Time,"I liked it better than ""A Painted House"". The characters seemed real, the story amusing, the idea of going on a cruise and skipping Christmas intriguing. I had a real problem, however, with the main character's concern over his daughter's boyfriend's skin color. It was brought up twice and ruined the book for me. Remember how relieved the parents were when they saw that the boyfriend was almost as light-skinned as they were? Did any of you readers out there notice this??"
3,Good,A good book which in a backwards way reminded me of the importance of Christmas and not to get caught up in the commercial aspect of Christmas.
2,Grisham's Skipping Christmas,"Just a short note. If you have read Grisham's novels and have been hooked by the story lines but distracted by the virulently racist characters you'll appreciate this warning.Don't get cozy with the Kranks.The reader is informed, halfway through the book, that the Kranks don't want their daughter to marry a man with dark skin. Its impossible to care about what happens to these two from then on.Skip Skipping Christmas. Or stop reading at page 112 and dream up your own ending. Its a fun book up to chapter 13."
3,Skipping Christmas,I would recommend Skipping Christmas if you like comedy books and advunture books you will and it has many twist in the book. Skpping Christmas is about a family of people and there daughter moves away to teach and her parents decide to skipp Christmas and save money to go on a cruse and the kranks run into all sorts of problems. I liked this book alot its a book for all ages and is a great book for the holidays.
2,Ho-hum,"This book was mildly amusing. I'll spare you the details; I'm sure you've seen the commercials for ""Christmas with the Kranks."" That commercial tells it all without even reading the book. This is one time when the movie will actually be better than the book.I would not recommend this book because it is not very entertaining and certainly not thought-provoking. But it's okay if you've been assigned to read a Christmas book for school or a book club.My first John Grisham book in a long time, and I was disappointed."
1,A Good Study in Modern Insanity,"To all of you scholars out there, or to even just the curious, read 1984 by George Orwell before you read this book (and just for kicks, read some of Plato's Republic, too) and get an eye-opener about where our society just might be heading."
2,Skipping Christmas Skipped an Ending,"Let me start by saying I enjoyed the introduction of each of the characters in the story. But, the story made everyone out to be angry, caniving, or just plain idiots.The idea of skipping Christmas was great, but the ending seemed to be without thought. As if the deadline from the publisher came around before the ending was thought up.The story had no meaning or moral. This will definatly not be a holliday read like; A Christmas Carol, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, or A Christmas Box."
4,Intriguing,"I enjoyed this book, and it would be a great movie. I think that it had many halirous antics that just added to the story. It was a very enjoyable book with a great plot. I think that grisham was smart to move away from his thrilling lawyer books and move to a more light topic. As luther and Nora krank have numerous differnt thing happen to them that makes it harder and harder to skip christmas the movie just gets funnier and funnier. If any one makes this a movie i will go see it"
5,"Rivals ""A Christmas Carol""",The story is a keeper! The kind of story you want to read again. We will definitely see it again in the form of a Christmas movie for 2003 or 2004!
3,Light Christmas reading....don't agree with recent review,"I just read this book for a second time, yesterday. It's a Christmas book with a message but it's not a serious book and shouldn't be taken that way.I found Tina's (Maldive, Indian Ocean) comment below, 'over the top'. Come on....I don't for a minute believe that the references to skin color were meant to be racist, in any way. John Grisham is not that kind of person/author, even if he was, would he be spouting off his racial beliefs in a 'fluff' book like this? I don't think so.His references to skin color are about the Krank's trying to hide their recent tanning sessions, in prep. for the upcoming cruise and trying to keep this from their daughter. I won't spoil the plot but Tina, at least in my opinion, is reading way too much into this part of the book. There are so many really racist comments and books out there to worry about, Skipping Christmas is not one of them."
4,Cool,"The book was really really really good, but I don't seem to remember the one guys name. The guy who sang with Enrique. Besides, didn't it say that in the book he had read hair and in the movie he had gray. When you read the book, you imagine all your characters really different, and that is what I liked."
1,Irritating,The characters were whiney and rather irritating to just read about! Rather disappointed after loving A Painted House.
1,Save your money,"This was a ridiculous tale made worse by the splash of racism thrown in for....added holiday cheer, perhaps?I hated every page of this story. A total waste of time and paper."
2,Boring!,"Clearly the only reason that this book is on best seller lists is the name John Grisham. I have read and enjoyed all of his previous books, but this one was boring. I really cannot think of a redeeming feature."
4,Funny and well written,I think this book is very well written.The author writes about a family who skips christmas because their daughter leaves for college.Its very well written and easy to read. Anyone that likes christmas can relate to this book.Its funny because it show the krank family's consequences of them skipping christmas and shows true reality of what people go through on the occasion.For example spending a large amounts of money on food like fruitcakes and spending lots of time decorating christmas lights.This story is also very suspensful because you want to know what will happen next.
4,Well Worth the Time,"This is a short little book. I finished it in a few hours. I think everybody that has had to slog through the stress of holiday shopping, cooking, etc. will be able to relate to this book. It says a LOT about life in suburbia and about all the meaningless junk we've piled on to the season. This book doesn't stack up to his classic legal thrillers, but then it wasn't meant to. Grisham meant it to be a nice little holiday story, and that's just what it is. This will undoubtedly show up as a tv movie some holiday season. Highly recommended."
5,Hilarious and Upbeat,"Skipping Christmas was a fast moving and VERY(I can agree with that)kind of book.It tells how ""off"" everyone goes at Christmas,and how exasperating it can be in a humorous and truthful way.From spending to much for no reason to stepping in sloshy snow up to your knees!"
3,A nice light read,"Sometimes I laughed, sometimes I agreed with the narrator, other times, I was bored by some of the predictability. Not too bad, but not Grisham's best effort."
4,"A funny, quick read",Non-pretentious. Laugh out loud towards the end. Sure to be a 90 minute TV movie next Christmas.
4,"Loved this book, although too short for the price.","Loved it, because many a Christmas I have felt the same way, it's just too much hazzle and I get stuck with all the work. But when it finally arrives and everyone is enjoying themselves then it seems worth it (almost). But I'd still like one Christmas away from home, maybe not the Carribean but Vienna or Germany, where I could be waited on and just enjoy the whole experience. So I really empathized with the couple in the book and loved the wit of the whole story. Of course, I always love Grisham's books. I only gave it 4 stars because it's such a short read for the price."
4,How Grisham Stole Christmas,"This book was so UNGrishamlike, but had his usual attention holding style. I completely indentified with the whole idea of too much spending at Christmas and it was SOOOOOOOOOO realistic. How many times have you rewrapped gifts and passed them on to someone else or let them hang in the closet when someone else could use them? Skipping Christmas was an adults version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas but had a delightful ending in which the main characters heart grew two sizes that day. Great Christmas story!"
1,Skipping This Christmas Book,"I have always enjoyed reading John Grisham and had no reason to think otherwise until I read this book. As with many ""departure"" books, this type of story telling is not Grisham's strength. I found the character development good but the story itself lacked depth and the ending was all too predictable. A disappointment for all Grisham fans."
4,The little thing of life,Great ending well. Look at all the thing we will go though to make our children happy give up our the little pleasure to make them happy
2,"Not my favorite John Grisham book, but enjoyed it.",I had already seen the movie so maybe that is why I did not enjoy the book as much as I usually do.
4,Grisham with a twist,"Fun read. I really enjoy reading his ""lawyer"" genre, but this one is also worth my money and my time. There have been times when I have thought of ""skipping"" the Christmas madness; just couldn't do it."
4,Great reading! Seasons Greetings!,"I saw the movie ""Christmas with The Kanks"" when it first came out and the DVD is wearing thin. LOL. That is why I couldn't wait yo buy this book. Yes, many parts were different in SOME ways, but enjoyed it. Will I read it again? Oh yes!"
2,A quick simple read,"This is a quick cute read but lacks substance and storyline. I was hoping that it would be as enjoyable as ""Painted House"" but was disappointed. Very predictable ending. I would have liked to see Grisham develop the characters more."
1,A quick read is this book's only saving grace.,"A couple of hours of my life that I will never regain. A potentially cute Christmas farce that falls flat and is poorly executed. The characters suffer from severe one dimensionality and Grisham's concept of character development seems to involve nothing more than a number of sentences of which punctuation is the only common element. Perhaps most disappointing is the racist undertone near the end of the book, where quite a bit of attention is paid to the skin color of a central character.If you were interested in reading a well written book with a similar concept of a husband interested in living outside the norms of society, you might try Nick Hornby's ""How To Be Good."" At least he makes an effort at literature and is not merely killing trees."
2,Want to be depressed for Christmas? Read this book,"Yes, Virginia, it does end happily, sort of, but Skipping Christmas is smug, cynical, repetative and derivative, all wrapped up in one easy to wrap package, just like a lump of coal.The characters aren't particularly sympathetic--they aren't even truly awful like Scrooge--they just sort of whine and complain.Some of the points are good, but we already knew that, and the pseudo-redemption at the last is too little, too late. Skip this book."
2,A good premise but too extreme and very inaccurate,"My husband and I ""skipped Christmas"" once by going to Australia and would like to do it again but not to the extreme that Grisham did. You can buy the calendars & friut cakes and put your frosty on the roof and still skip all the other hassles. The biggest problem I had with his book was his research mistakes. Just like his last book, he either decided to do no research or didn't care about being accurate. There is no ship called ""Island"" Princess but I'll let that one go. But Princess (and many other lines) does not have any 10 day voyage that stops in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, those are all 7 day trips. And the biggest blunder - cruise insurance does NOT pay if you change your mind! Many people found this out after 9/11. You have to have a valid (insured) reason to cancel your trip. So his multiple remarks about not having bought insurance wouldn't have made a bit of difference."
1,blah,"John Grishams style of writing just doesn't please me. I find his books a low trashy style of novel very popular these days. His writing style, devlopment, and sentence structure reminds me of 12 year old writer!"
1,Skipping Christmas,Could hardly believe this piece of fluff was writting by John Irving! The only reason it gets any stars from me at all is that I have always been a big fan of his.
3,No Peace Corps Program in Peru,"Peace Corps closed its program in Peru in l975, an essential fact that Grisham never bothered to research. Additionally, Peace Corps Volunteers attend stagings in the U.S. and leave as a group for their assigned countries, where they begin a two to three month training period, living with host families before beginning their assignments. They aren't escorted to the airport by parents on Thanksgiving weekends nor are they ensconsed in grass huts with coworkers immediately upon arrival.These may seem quibbles, but any journalist will attest to the importance of getting the facts straight to lend authenticity to a piece of work. Though I'm enjoying the Kranks as I Metro from Silver Spring to Peace Corps headquarters here in D.C., I have a tough time suspending disbelief."
4,OK for a short read,"Pleasant story with decent writing. No thinking needed to read this book, just sit back and enjoy the story."
3,A light one sitting read,This book was enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed in the end though. It all came to a close so fast that I felt kind of cheated. It is good for a lighthearted read however. It was a bit farfetched that any neighborhood would come together like that one did though. I cant imagine anyone's neighbors in these days and times being so wrapped up in each others lives.
2,All the wrong reasons,"What a terrible Christmas book! Everyone is motivated by all the wrong reasons and no one changes. Everyone is hateful to the Kranks and they are hateful in return. They skip Christmas to save money. They then have Christmas to help their daughter catch a husband. People on their street decorate grimly--not out of a sense of celebration but rather one of duty. When Krank breaks step they don't throw off the shackles, but urge him to get back in step. One of his neighbors calls the cops on him. Charitable people doing good works are seen as con men. The Boy Scout leader gouges him when he has to buy a tree at the last minute. He and his wife seem to be engaged in a war. I feel like I've been ripped off. Thanks John! What a ""nice"" Christmas message!"
1,Disappointed,"I very much enjoyed A Painted House and had high expectations for this book as well. It was childish, from the character names to the inane plot (?). I would have liked to contact Mr. Grisham, but found through his web-site, that that is not possible. I would, in all probability, invest in a sequel to A Painted House, but will steer clear of any ""holiday specials"", The Grinch has a much higher rating in my opinion."
1,Not worth the publishing costs,"I have read all of Grisham's books and liked them all (although I thought Painted House was only 'okay'). I found his latest to be offensive (is everyone in this town christian?) and ridiculously unrealistic (why would so many people care?). The ending, obviously, was predictable. Altogether, I would not give it one star; I found it very boring and only read it because my book group picked it. Grisham: Give me a break; go back to the genre you were meant to write in."
5,A must read to ease the Christmas stress in your own life.,"An extremely funny look at how Christmas really has gotten out of hand. It makes you think of how much you really spend on gifts and that perfect outfit for the holiday office party. Luther and Nora are the typical couple who decide to skip Christmas and take a cruise. A real pick me up in light of recent events and it is laugh out loud funny. A great gift for the hard to buy for person. Even if you are not an avid reader let this be the first book you have read in years. A very quick read at 175 pages you can read it in one sitting. If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, get the CD verssion for your road trip. That's what I am doing for my parents. A real change for Grisham who usually rights legal drama. What a perfect book for the holiday season........I have to go shopping now......BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Did he have to fulfill some kind of contract, or what?","What a stupid book. The idea of ""skipping Christmas"" is only remotely interesting (news flash - there are lots and lots of people who don't spend $7,000 on gifts, an expensive party, custom Christmas cards, and Christmas decorations every year!!) Its poorly written for starters, and the main character is just pompous and mean and inspires no sympathy, who really cares if he skips Christmas? It reads like some creative writing assignment from a junior high schooler. He obviously was hoping to cash in by writing this slapdash little story in about ten minutes and selling it to people for the price of a hardback. If you're a normal person who doesn't have a special stationery boutique that takes it upon themselves to phone you personally to design your Christmas cards (ever hear of Walmart?) then you will not relate to the characters in this book."
1,Skipping Grisham,"John Grisham should be ashamed of himself. This is the lamest, weakest, most boring, sad excuse for literature that I've ever encountered. Obviously intended to be a quick hit to his bank account."
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read!,"Skipping Christmas is the best book I've ever read! Who couldn't love the sweet Nora and her Scrooge-like husband Luther, who seems heartless but has one somewhere beneath all his pride and superiority. I've memorized the book and the movie, and Tim Allen and Jaime Lee Curtis were exactly as I had pictured them! This book was one of the few books I own that have depth to them and yet I could still read it to my little sister, who is 10. This book has been the best Christmas story I've ever read, one of the best Christmas movies I've ever seen, and, the best part is, they don't push religion and the true meaning of Christmas (if you're religious), which is the birth of Christ, down our throats. It's a fast, funny read that everyone will enjoy!"
4,If Christmas is a frustrating time for you...,"If Christmas is a frustrating time for you, then you will really enjoy this book. I've always been frustrated by the commercialization of Christmas, as well as the expectations that I decorate my house, send a card to everyone I've ever met, etc. I found this book to be hilarious, and if you're like me, you will too. I wasn't thrilled by the ""surprise"" (which is given away in many of the reviews below), which is why I subtracted one star from my rating. Sure, it's not a classic Grisham legal thriller, but it was a fun diversion, a quick read, and left me smiling during another frustrating Christmas season."
4,Don't Skip this book!,"A friend of mine read this book to me over the phone, a chapter at a time. It is the perfect book to read aloud, and it doesn't even have to be Christmastime to enjoy it. I thought the book was so funny and sweet. This is a total change of pace from Grisham's usual books, but who says that can't be a good thing?The characters are charming, and the twists and turns of trying to skip Christmas keep you guessing. A cute, light-hearted read."
3,"Light, Festive Holiday Read","John Grisham takes a break from writing legal thrillers and puts a new spin on the hustle and bustle of the Christmas holidays in his novel, Skipping Christmas.As Luther Krank, an accountant, tallies up last year's Christmas expenses and headaches, he decides that the best plan for this year would be to skip Christmas all together. Especially with his daughter out of the country aiding the Peace Corps. While it took a little convincing for his wife, Nora, the Kranks agree to restrict Christmas spending, Christmas decorations and Christmas parties and instead spend their money on a cruise.However, the Kranks learn that thier new Christmas activities, or the lack thereof, may be more of a headache and disaster than they planned for.With many laughs along the way, Grisham tells a wonderful, festive story with true Christmas spirit shining through in the end."
1,Skipping this one,"This book is intended to be funny and touching. Instead, it is lackluster and maudlin. Don't skip Christmas but do skip this book.(I'm sorry I had to give it even one star but my review was accepted with no stars.)"
2,HoHum,"This was an ""okay"" book. A quick read, very predictable, very contrived for the holiday season. I would skip it."
1,I could not believe it!!!,"This book had the most racist paragraph that I have ever seen in a novel. The daughter of the main character surprises him with a fiancé from Peru. The parents look to see how dark he is before they even speak to him. They are then relieved that he is actually a couple shades paler than the white...but tanned father. They then proceed to describe him as handsome(i.e. not dark) for the rest of the book. The fiancé was also acceptable because he could speak perfect English because he was educated in England. This whole thing was wrong on so many levels. Since I am a middle aged woman, I have bought and read many novels by this author. This is my last one. This blatant racism and insensitivity hurt my feelings and made me sad."
2,Not My Type,"I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future. Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it. It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into. I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or ""written down to"". It's simple writing and a simple plot. It's lighthearted and thus a light read. I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it. :o\"
2,waste of time,"what was grisham thinking? this book is at best mildly amusing. surely we have all thought of skipping christmas at one time or another; how could such an accomplished author have written such a shallow version of the idea? he doesn't need the money, i am sure.so, i am left with wondering, what on earth was the purpose of this book?"
2,Glad I only read this one in the bookstore....,"In response to another reviewer asking if this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared, YES, it is. With the big movie coming out, I picked the book up out of curiousity and read it cover to cover. Boy, did it READ like a movie too, and I could see the ending walking up Hemlock Street. The only other Grisham I've read was ""A Painted House,"" which seems immensely more entertaining, plausable, interesting when compared to this piece of detritus. If you're looking for a book that panders to the materialistic suburbanite crowd, and you can't get into the books that Oprah and The Today Show tell you to read, this is for you."
2,Dull - with a splash of racism,"I found the story predictable - a made-for-TV-movie script - except for the slightly disturbing ending. The Kranks are worried that their daughter is marrying a Peruvian, though their worries are slightly mitigated by the fact that he did his training in London. And, when they meet him, they're relieved to find out ""he isn't dark at all!"" Phew! Grisham doesn't put this in as a comment on the Kranks but as a genuine aspect of their happy ending. Hmmm... food for thought."
4,A Christmas Comical,"John Grisham's latest book is a humorous story about a couple who decides that they are going to attempt to ""skip Christmas."" It is very comical in a soap-opera kind of way as it moves through the days of December and the mishaps that encounter them. It is a quick read (one or two sittings) and is successful in delivering the Christmas spirit. This would be a great read if you want to read over the holiday but haven't a lot of time."
1,THIS BOOK ...,"I bought this book as a nice, little surprise for my wife at Christmas. ""What a nice little picture on the cover,"" I said to myself when I bought it. ""She's always liked Grisham novels"", I said to myself as I wrapped it in gold foil paper. ""This will be so funny, I can't wait,"" as she opened it.DAMN! What a piece of...! This ""book""... so badly, I'm still mopping the floor. This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I cannot believe it ever got published, and millions of us bought a copy.If Grisham is even interested in redeeming himself in the public eye, he should donate every penny from the sales of this book to a worthy cause."
1,Skipping pages...,"A big Grisham fan, I was terribly disappointed with this book. It was redundant and I could not finish it. I bought it with such joy and anticipation because I completely loved A Painted House (I want a sequal to that)and expected another beautifully written novel that was not centered on law. Every page seemed to be a chore to read. I pick it up still in hopes that eventually the story will go somewhere, but I am more than 3/4 finished with it and still am not interested. If you want a good Grisham novel, read A Painted House. That was one I could not put down- it was a ""call in sick to work"" kind of book."
1,Why??,"I just want to know why on earth John Grisham has started to write bull like this. The Brethren was his last good novel. He should go back the legal thrillers that made him a famous comtemporary writer. Now he is just using his name to sell the crap that he writes. Personally, I want to old John Grisham back."
3,Skipping Christmas,"I really enjoyed this book. A very quick, silly read. Very funny and perfect to read during the hustle and bustle of the holiday season."
4,UNDERCURRENTS OF A MIDDLE AGE CRISIS?,"FROM READING PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND LISTENING TO A FRIEND'S RAVING ABOUT THIS BOOK, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A TRY. WHAT I FOUND TO BE AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION TURNED OUT TO BE A DISHEARTENING MISADVENTURE. WHILE MR. GRISHAM HAS MOST DEFINITELY ADDRESSED THE MATERIALISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE, HE HAS ALSO MADE SOME INTERESTING UNDERLYING POINTS, CHIEF OF WHICH, IS THE ESCAPISM THAT WE ALL WANT ON OCCASION, TO PURSUE A DREAM OF A DIFFERENT SORT.I PERSONALLY WAS SADDENED THAT LUTHER'S DREAM DIDN'T GET REALIZED. I ALSO THOUGHT IT QUITE TRAGIC THAT HIS WIFE COULD NOT SEE THE STATE OF DESPERATION THAT HE WAS IN. I DIDN'T FIND MUCH HUMOR IN THIS BOOK. BUT, I DO APPRECIATE THE SELFLESSNESS THAT LUTHER DISPLAYED IN THE END.I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER IF MR. GRISHAM HAS HIT THE NAIL PERFECTLY ON THE HEAD WITH ALL OF THE UNDERCURRING THEMES. IT JUST SADDENS ME THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK THIS BOOK HUMOROUS."
4,Entertaining holiday reading,"Have you ever tried to skip Christmas? Blair, Luther and Nora's only child, is away with the Peace Corps in Peru, so Luther and Nora decide to skip all the Holiday fanfare and expense and spend some money on themselves. Easier said than done, when the entire town is watching and campaigning for Christmas. Skipping includes saying no to the city's firemen when they come round to sell their horrid fruitcakes, no to the doe-eyed boy scouts selling Christmas trees, and no to the entire neighbourhood, that always sets up a huge Frosty on every roof. The ending was a bit of a disappointment, though. I wanted a light book to read over the Holidays and this hit the spot. I am probably one of the few people who has not read John Grisham before, but I enjoyed this book and have been favourably influenced towards his other works."
3,"Good, solid story","John Grisham takes a fairly simple premise and weaves it into a short, yet worthwhile title. It may not stand up with his other books, but you could do far worse. It reads well and ""omits needless words"" to keep the boredom down. A Christmas Carol is a better read at Christmas, but a modern day tale of foregoing the rat-race of the holidays blooms. 3 out of 5"
2,Promising start,But as book progressed it became a typical primary school read. Am an avid John Grisham reader.This is one I would not recommend.Man this one could have gone so many fantastic places. It fizzled out.
3,Quick read,"Chosen for our book club's early January meeting. It was appropriately seasonal. Even though it was fairly predictable, it was a good read. A change from usual John Grisham!"
2,Silly,"Pure fluff, although well-written since it's by Grisham. I light read for the holidays that I found to be pretty predictable. A few funny moments but all in all, reminded me of a Family Channel movie."
3,Christmas book that lacks believability!,This book was chosen as our December read for our book club. We thought it would be upbeat and an easy read during this busy time of the year. Most of us are professionals and we found the book totally lacking believability but not from the protagonist but from the daughter. Her story was just plain ridiculous! We all agreed the best part was the giving away the cruise tickets as that was a sign of the true meaning of Christmas.John Grisham should stick to what he does best....mysteries.
3,Didn't Glue Itself to My Hand,"Frankly, I was disappointed, and many times thought of not finishing the book. But ... it was so small, I stuck it out. The ending was good, but getting there was a chore. Mr. Grisham should stick to what he knows."
3,"Not his best work, but ok for a quick read","This is not Grishams best, but it is enjoyable and quick. I did think some parts were a little boring. Its a good thing it was a short novel, otherwise I might feel like i wasted time. I do think it is overated a bit. I give it 3 stars because it's a holiday book with a meaning."
1,Did I miss something?,"Either Grisham's satire, parody and ironic wit went over my head...or this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared. Duh! Stick to thrillers, John. This would have been more appropriate for the yearly Christmas letter sent to your family and friends."
2,John Grisham-Skipping Christmas,"I thought the book was a very ""hard"" read. It was not one of John Grisham's better books."
4,Cute Story,"Ok, I wasn't too sure about buying the book, but I did and thought it was well worth it. I needed a little time out to read something cute. My mother told me that she thought the book was cute so I thought I would try it.Well, I thought the book was delightful. It's true how much you spend on Christmas get's out of control. It was just a silly book but very well written. I would say, you want a little funny reading, read this book!"
2,The Triumph Of Peer Pressure And Deception,"I enjoy many of Mr. Grisham's books. They're fun escapism. But excluding the touching ending, ""Skipping Christmas"" brings neighborhood peer pressure and rampant consumption to the front and center. The author takes pains in ridiculing the heaping amounts of guilt, familial bickering and work involved for people who participate in Christmas. The only ones who seem to get a ""Get Out Of Jail Free"" card are individuals that are not Christians. Everybody else is expected to tow the line. The Krank's neighborhood is like a Yuletide version of ""The Stepford Wives,"" but instead of just the women, practically everybody is an automaton. Ultimately, the book, intentionally or not, praises holiday conformity and family deception. Bah, humbug!"
2,I Don't Get It,"I've read two very different books by John Grisham and I have to say, I don't get his appeal. Skipping Christmas has a decent premise: fed up with the expense and consumerism of Christmas, a couple decides to skip the celebrations and instead go on a Caribbean cruise. The news doesn't sit well with the neighbors, who for some reason feel they have a say in their decision.As I said, the idea is not bad, but the writing is so mediocre (and in occasions, worse than mediocre) that the novel never engages the reader. The end is better than the rest of the book, and it manages to be moving, but even though this novel is only 277 pages, it feels very, very long."
2,Missed it's mark,"I was instantly [pulled] into the book when I sat down to read it. However, the more I read the more it seemed predictable, and at the same time lost it's way. I was hoping for a better ending, but instead got exactly what I thought would happen. It seemed Mr. Grisham couldn't think of any other way to end it, or forgot where he was originally headed with this book. It could have made such an impression on people if he had stuck with his idea, but instead he bent to what our culture deems normal....putting the Frosty up on the roof..God forbid we do anything else by our own free will. Too Bad."
1,Don't waste your time or your money on this book!,"This Grisham Christmas fairy tale was a big disappointment. The story of Nora and Luther Krank's (could he choose better names for his characters?) decision to ""skip Christmas"" was a slow read from beginning to end. Travel plans, nasty, controlling neighbors and a pollyanna ending was laughable. This book would never have been published in the first place had it not been written by Grisham. He should stick to the type of writing he does best. Christmas ""fairy tales"" are NOT Grisham's strength!"
5,Skipping Christmas,I was wondering how John Grisham was going to twist this family's desire to skip Christmas into an amusing tale. I laughed out loud while reading all the humorous details of throwing it all together at the last minute. Even those of us who plan everything to death can appreciate the frantic rush of Christmas and how there is just NEVER enough time before the big day.An easy read. No lawyers or courtrooms. I nice change for this author!
2,Disappointed I spent the time,"I always believe if you take the time to read, make it worthwhile. Something to tickle the kanoodle at least. This book was just a waste. It would be fun for a 12 year old. It was just downright silly. I expected more from Mr. Grisham. I am willing to bet that one of his kids either wrote it or gave him the story line."
1,sentimental drivel,This was too silly for grade school reading group. I couldn't believe Grishman was the author (at least not a grownup Grisham). Did he write this as a pre-teen. Stereotypical goody-goody characters and stupid people doing stupid things. Ugh.. I think I'll celebrate Christmas and skip Grisham!!!
1,What's wrong with our society?,"I'm not sure how anyone could give this book a good rating. I was annoyed thoughout the entire book and wondered how any reader could think the behavior of the neighbors and friends (and many times the wife) was appropriate and acceptable. The message tells me that if you don't do what your friends and neighbors want you to do...especially when it comes to Christmas...they will treat you with hatred and disdane until they can bring you around to their way of thinking. If the majority of our society truly believes that taking a break from the madness of Christmas is this atrocious of an idea, I'm very worried about the direction we are heading."
4,Not the usual Grisham,"This is a delightful little story and unfortunately, probably too true as it describes how hard it would be in this culture to just not celebrate Christmas. Nothing too deep here and no legal intrigue but it's fun. I was cheering for the main characters to make it through the season with no tree, no presents, no parties. May try it myself one of these years. The message in the ending (which I won't give away) is a valuable one."
1,Racist gag ruins otherwise light farce,"My enjoyment in this book was ruined by Mr. Grisham's use of a racist gag. Without ""spoiling"" for others a book now quite spoiled for me, I will simply say this: Mr. Grisham's ""happy ending"" included the fact that a certain character turned out not to have ""dark skin,"" to the dear, sweet Kranks' ""relief."" Appalling. I cannot think why Mr. Grisham chose to endow his protagonists with this openly racist attitude. It had nothing to do with the story or its theme. I hope that in future Mr. Grisham will refrain from including gratuitous racist gags in his books. He and his publisher should also keep in mind that people of color read -- and purchase -- books, too."
3,Ok Types,"The book started on a promising note and I thought it would be similar to something like playing for pizza/ Calico Joe. However, Grisham seems to have run out of ideas midway on how to end the book. And therefore the rather abrupt ending with everyone coming together to support a Merry Christmas. After one finishes the book, you get the feeling that something was missing."
3,Skipping Christmas,"A so so novel.Not up to John's usual books.Had an unexpected conclusion by not skipping Christmas.Not a ""Must Read."""
5,Laughing Reader,"This book was recommended to me by my father. I must say, it is the funniest book I have ever read! I laughed so hard there were tears in my eyes. I must have laughed out loud for 20 minutes before I could resume reading at the point where he is trying to put Frosty on the roof. It surprised me that John Grisham wrote about things other than lawyers and courts. The book is truly a delightful read. Highly recommeded."
2,"Skip the book, watch the movie.","I thought the movie was better than the book. While the movie had funny scenes, the book was kinda dry."
2,"If it didn't have the words ""John Grisham"" on the cover...","I have really enjoyed all Grisham's other books, including the out-of-character ""Painted House"", but if this book had not been written by an already very sucessful writer, it would never have been published. What is meant to be subtle is boring and what is meant to be indentifiable and comforting is painfully predictable."
4,Entertaining!!!,"Grisham, for the second time, moved away from his usual genre so that he could give us,the real fans, a taste of his mildly wacky side. I had a good time reading Skipping Christmas, realizing after all that this author is not your typical millionaire-snob with a mountain of a chip on his shoulder;he is funny, he cusses like the best of us and is too human to be hated. Thanks for the laughs!"
5,Skipping Christmas,Skipping Christmas was an eye opening story to read during the holidays. We changed the way we celebrate Christmas after reading this book. I was impressed Grisham could change subjects. He is an excellent writer and this new venue has made me pick him up again.
4,Quick Read,"When Blair Krank leaves home for a year in Peru, her parents realize that Christmas just won't be the same this year. Luther Krank, a tax accountant, calculates that last year Christmas cost them $6,100 and decides that this year the Kranks should skip the Christmas festivities altogether and take a Caribbean cruise instead. With the cruise booked and word out that they won't be celebrating this year, the Krank's begin to prepare for their departure on 25 December but what they aren't prepared for is the reaction of their friends and neighbors who are determined that they won't skip Christmas that easily. But, when 'disaster' strikes the neighbors all pull together and show that they really are full of the Christmas spirit. This short novel is a quick and funny read. I recommend it to anyone whether you love Christmas or can think of nothing better than skipping Christmas yourself. Also read ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Little Book of Wisdom"" by Taro Gold."
2,Ok for an airplane book,"This book works if you need something to read on a plane trip from Florida to Ohio. It held my interest to an extent. However, I got the feeling he knocked this one off in about the time it takes to type it. It takes about 3 minutes to figure out his daughter is coming home for Christmas. Wait for the paperback."
3,interesting...but i've read better,"The book had a great beginning and good characterization. The middle of the book when the plot developed kept me interested. The end was disappointing, however, and seemed to negate the whole point of the story. I wish they had continued as planned. Also, the whole marriage thing surprised me as well, and I didn't like that either. Grisham had a good idea at the beginning, but his twist of plot at the end made the book a disappointment."
3,Decent Quick Read,"Although I enjoyed reading the book, however it did appear to me to be essentially an extended magazine fiction story and it did get kind of repititive at times. Also, the Peruvian skin color thing was not needed in the story. I'm not a PC fan but if something in the story is going to be politically incorrect at least weave it into the story some kind of way. I could have understood if Mr. Krank was portrayed as an Archie Bunker-type or something. Or at least clarify why the character may have something against their daughter's fiance's skin color. There was nothing explained, it was just plopped in the book two times for no reason.Nevertheless, this is a nice quick Christmas read."
1,Do yourself a favor and SKIP this book!,"This book was boring and a waste of time. I only finished it because it was so short. The majority of the book deals with a family and their days before Christmas - nothing unusual or exciting. The ending was a little better than the majority of the book. If you must read because it is by Grisham, do not waste your money and get if from the library."
3,Skipping This Book,"amazon.com reviewers are urged not to be ""Spoilers! Please don't reveal crucial plot elements."" No need on John's Grisham's failed attempt to write a little Christmas story. The plot may be summed up in three words, predictable, predictable, predictable. Its a slim volume, but it could have been summed up in a half dozen sentences or a short story.This is a disappointing effort from an author who has in the past kept me up at night because I could not bear to put down his latest book. Even his last, ""A Painted House,"" contained sufficient surprises to make me forget I was being inconvenienced by airport delays and cancelled flights.Unless you're a reader who wishes to be able to display ""everything Grisham ever wrote"" in hardcover on your bookshelf, read this one at the library."
1,Skipping this book....,"...would have been a good idea. I got this book to read on a trip when I ""skipped Christmas"". I thought it was an approprate read AND I (usually) love Grisham books.I did not enjoy this book at all. It was nothing like his other books. I kept waiting for the twist, but it never came.I was disappointed that I actually paid full price for this book and did not wait for it to come out in paperback or borrow from the library."
1,Skip It,"Unrealistic, materialistic, we-are-all-the-same neighbors (must have plastic snowman on roof! big brother is watching you!), boring plot, peer pressure for the middle-aged ending. What a waste of perfectly good paper. There is absolutely nothing in this book to make you glad you read it. I know I'm sorry I did."
2,Not very convincing,"In my opinion, most of the charactars and situations were not believable. Nora Krank is too nasty to Luther to have you believe they have a happy marriage. Personally, if I were Luther and she treated me the way she treats him,, I would visit a lawyer rather than take her on a Cruise. The premise is great, but the story was dissapointing."
4,"A great story, full of Christmas spirit.","When Blair Krank leaves home for a year in Peru, her parents realise that Christmas just won't be the same this year. Luther Krank, a tax accountant, calculates that last year Christmas cost them $6,100 and decides that this year the Kranks should skip the Christmas festivities altogether and take a Caribbean cruise instead.With the cruise booked and word out that they won't be celebrating this year, the Krank's begin to prepare for their departure on 25 December but what they aren't prepared for is the reaction of their friends and neighbours who are determined that they won't skip Christmas that easily. But, when 'disaster' strikes the neighbours all pull together and show that they really are full of the Christmas spirit.This short novel is a quick and funny read which made me want to put on the Christmas songs and decorate the tree. I would recommend it to anyone whether you love Christmas or can think of nothing better than skipping Christmas yourself."
4,Add it to your Holiday Collection,"Every Christmas I read one book with a Holiday theme. This year I chose Grisham's little ornament of a book, and I am glad I did. It has all of the necessary ingredients: humor, love, gratitude, all stirred in with likeable ""Grisham"" characters. Invest a few hours of your time, and you will get the same feeling you got the first time you read, and understood, Dicken's holiday classic. Well, not quite but almost! Merry Christmas to all the Grisham fans out there."
3,Just typical.,"Luther and Nora Krank send there daughter Blair off to Peru for peace corps work a month before Christmas. Feeling sad The Kranks decide to skip Christmas this year and go on a 10 day sunshined filled cruise,scheduled to leave Christmas afternoon.All the locals of Hemlock street-except the Kranks- start the anual decoration rituals-including all roofs equiped with a 7 foot Frosty the snowman. Upon noticing the Kranks have decided to Skip Christmas the locals start harrasing the Kranks with carols, anonymous Christmas cards with were's Frosty and so on.Well without going on and giving the whole story away,I will say,the story started slow the middle was pretty funny,the ending was typical. It seems the author threw in a couple of characters for the heck of it. Who the heck was Marty and why did you include him in the story? Not bad. Quick easy read. Just typical."
3,"Different, short, funny","I read this book in one sitting during an hour and a half long free period. It was funny, not that original, but still worth reading. The characters didn'texactly come to life, and I wish I had neighbors as nice as the main characers. if I hadn't been given it for christmas I probably would not have read it at all, and I certainly wouldn't buy it for myself, so If I were you I'd wait until its in your local Library.I'd say 3 and a half stars."
2,Insulting to the mind,"Personally, I thought the concept of the book would be a light hearted boost to the holiday season. However, I found Grisham to be continuing his downward spiral in his profession. The story took one pathetic turn after another leaving you with the feeling that ""the main characters"" were not the crazy ones, but the rest of the world was. I don't believe human nature to be as shallow as Grisham seems to make us feel. If a new author on the scene had tried to push this book past a publisher, he would have had a dumpster full of rejection notices. But of course, the Grisham name sells books even as he continues to crank them out faster than hollywood can make the next movie. Once a huge fan because of his research and detail, now very leary of picking up the next ""new"" Grisham ""tragedy""."
3,Grisham's blandest book yet,"This book reads as if it were written by a first-time novelist. The story line is dull and the characters are flatter than paper dolls. I got the feeling Grisham wrote this one in a hurry. The saddest part is that the two main characters, weary of the commercialism and chaos of Christmases past, decide to completely skip Christmas. The story would have proved much more compelling had the characters tried to skip the commercialism but find a more meaningful and spiritual way to celebrate the holiday."
1,Proving the power of a brand,"Grisham is a strong brand, nicely demonstrated by the fact that hundreds of thousands of suckers, myself included, rushed to buy this thin story hoping for another Grisham pageturner.Do we keep the faith and buy ""The Summons"" after this deeply disappointing offering??"
2,hmm..not so much...,"thought it would be a great novel, since grisham is amazing, but wound up falling asleep w/in the first 20 pgs. woke up, gave it a second chance, thinking it would be a cute little book, but just got irritated the more i read. sorry. i love john grisham, but this is one i wouldn't recommend, esp. if you've read his other books."
3,Skipping Christmas,"I found this to be an amusing, lightweight read. It is a bit far fetched in places but probably depicts well the dynamics that can exist between couples who have been together for a long time. The husband comes across as pragmatic in pursuit of a specific goal while his wife tends to be over emotional and subject to fears about what the neighbours think. The neighbours are a mad lot and their interaction with the couple is bizzare. It's a funny book and worth a read"
5,SOOOOO FUNNY!,OMG THIS BOOK WAS SOOOO FUNNY!! I could NOT put it down! My 83 year old aunt gave it to me after telling me it was a hoot and boy was she right! This was soo different from any of Grisham's previous works and it was such an easy fun light read! They need to hurry up and make a movie out of it!!Couldn't stop LAUGHING
1,Oh My G-D! its Horrible!,"When you finish reading all you can think about is why the author didn't skip chapter 3-18 and go straight to the end. the ""heart"" of the book is so boring and predictable you will not believe you actually spent your time on it. Such a dissapiontment. maybe grisham should stick to the law books.the story just develops nowhere. an absalout waste of time if you ask me!"
3,Enjoyable Story,"I do not believe this will be a Christmas classic. In fact I do not consider it a John Grisham classic. Nevertheless it is light reading and enjoyable. The author spins an interesting tale of a couple who had reached the point of not wishing to participate in Christmas activities, at least for this particular Christmas. Perhaps most of us at one time or another were not enthusiastic for Christmas decorating, Christmas shopping or Christmas parties. This particular couple dicided to do something about it. As a result we are privy to the obstacles they faced laced with a fair amount of humor. Some Christmas spirit did find its way into the story."
2,Skip this one,"I couldn't help suspecting that there was an underlying mean-spiritedness about this short novel. The characters evoke not a single emotion and the overall feeling is flat. There are better stories about Christmas, both happy and sad. Skipping Christmas isn't one I'll read again."
1,Pretty sad....,"This book would play out better on the movie screen. The sadness of the story could be laughable on the screen, but on paper, it becomes a drag. Don't bother reading it."
1,What a disappointment!,"I know that John Grisham is a very thoughtful writer, and I have enjoyed reading all his previous books. This one intrigued me because one of the reviewers indicated that the couple who decide to skip Christmas finally discover the true meaning of the holiday in the end. Don't make the mistake I made... there is precious little that this couple discovers about anything in the end! There is no character development anywhere. In ""The Testament"" Grisham gave us a taste of someone who truly goes through a transformation, and I was hoping there would be something of that sort in ""Skipping Christmas."" No such luck, this book's tone throughout is nasty and demeaning, which some people could call sarcastic, but when that's all you have, it's really not worth reading it--the last 2-3 pages did nothing to redeem the rest of the story. Sorry, John, but you can do, and have done, so much better elsewhere!"
5,Excellent book. Good ending.,I enjoyed this one although I do wish it had been a bit longer.Good story and excellent finish. John Grisham did it again!
3,Good Christmas Story,"This was a good Christmas story. The is a very light-hearted book that makes a great read for Christmas break. It isn't Grisham's greatest work, but not the worst either. I would recommend it if you have some free time around Christmas."
2,Grisham doesn't live up to his name,"The whole idea of the novel was a good one considering it was John Grisham. I liked the novel as it took off but also got a bit lagging and boring. The book was also one of the big hits in the literature industry but as more and more people read the book, they figure out what it's really about. Luther and Nora Krank, the parents who decide to skip Christmas, love and sacrifice their trip for their daughter Blair. I think that Blair is on of the characters that I enjoyed because she seemed to changed the novel and give it a big kick about the book."
2,Should have been a magazine short story,"If your looking for a typical Grisham novel, think twice before buying this one. The story is very dull, not much depth. The story would have been cute as a 5 page short story in a magazine. I read it, hoping it would get better but it remained dull and boring."
3,"Good Shot, But Not Quite on Center","I've never read Grisham before. I bought this because I like a good Christmas read. My ten year old and my wife breezed through it before I could get to it. Overall, I liked the message Grisham is sending in this book. I think we all get tired of the insane commercialism and obligations of Christmas. I could easily aspire to Luther Krank's agenda for avoiding it all this one year. As a reader, one does feel sympathy toward the Kranks and hopes they can pull it off. Their spolied daughter is the one that makes you sick in the end. I guess I did not give it more stars because of the creative possibilities that could have been explored if Grisham went another route. It is a very readable book no matter. Buy it to day at Amazon.Com!"
4,"A Good, Quick Read","Skipping Christmas is a great book if you're looking for a quick read that offers a cute story, laugh-out-loud lines, and no evil plot or villians. It's not John Grisham's usual legal thriller, but it's still good. I think at one time or another, every one can relate to Mr. Krank's feelings. This book is definitely worth the few hours it takes to read."
3,Like a summer blockbuster movie...,"...turn off your brain and enjoy! If you don't think about this book too hard, it's an entertaining piece of fluff. If you enjoy books with depth and reasoning, you'd do best to avoid Skipping Christmas. The idea is a good one, but is not a fully realized one...as is the problem of many Grisham books. I didn't hate the read...but it wasn't very memorable. It'll make a great movie...and yes, a movie is already in the works. Hey, it's got to be better than that ""Grinch"" movie!"
3,Skipping Christmas? NOT!!,"I viewed the first 2 chapters on the net. I admit, I was hooked! I couldnt wait to get my hands on the book. When I finally received it, I was alittle disappointed that the book was so small, I read it in 3 hrs. The beginning was excellent, but as I got to the end, boy was I disappointed! I find myself feeling like Luther Krank, just wanting to skip it all together. The way he describes the hassle and expense of the whole over-rated, commercialized (def. to exploit for profit) holiday, I surely related to all this. As I approched the end, I thought ""Oh no, NO NO No! But I guess the moral of the story is, Christmas is not the hassle and expense that comes with the holiday, but the spirit of sharing and Love."
1,Waste of time,"Reading Skipping Christmas is like waiting for a really bad joke teller to stumble through to the punch line when you already know what the punch line is. The book is filled with flat characters, moronic dialog and a plot so painfully obvious it would have a tough time passing muster for a sitcom. Don't waste your time."
4,Grisham has good idea...,"I think that John Grisham has a wonderful idea for this story. Christmas has become a major pain, well for me anyway. I'm really not trying to be a ""Scrooge"", but as a single parent, the pressure seems overwhelming.I digress. This book is great for a light, humorous look at a different sort of Christmas. Luther Krank had a great idea, but it was ruined by both his wife and daughter. It's a delightful read. Merry Christmas!"
4,Consise,"""Skipping Christmas"" was short, consise, and insightful. Luther displayed feelings most of us share briefly during the hustle and bustle of Holiday shopping, still in the end he shows that he is a true ""Santa."" Good book to read any time of the year. Grisham's characters and his dialogue all ring with truth. He puts you in the midst of the narrative and keeps you interested.Beverly J Scott author of ""Righteous Revenge."""
2,Not So Good,"I am amazed at all the good reviews here about this book. I am a fan of John Grisham and have enjoyed all his books, but this one was a major dissappointment. I can't believe he wrote it.It's not that I object to a subject other that the law,(""A Painted House"" was most enjoyable). The subject of this book, skipping the holidays & doing something else, sounded interesting and I had high hopes when I started reading, but Grisham's heart was obviously not in it.Skip ""Skipping Christmas""."
4,"It would make a cute movie, too","Yes, it was a very light and easy read, but it was enjoyable and funny, too. We read it on the drive back from California. We also decided it would make a cute movie with Steve Martin at Luther."
5,Who really wants to skip Christmas?,"I really enjoyed this book overall. I recommend this book to people of all ages. There were so many parts all the way through it that just made me laugh. I understand the way they wanted to skip Christmas because of it saving them money, but is it worth it? I don't think so. Even if they don't have their daughter, skipping Christmas would be like they just wanted to forget all about it along with their great memories. How could anyone want to do that? Throughout the book one really sees the way people today over commercialize the Christmas season. People buy to many decorations to put up inside and out on their house just to compete against their neighbors with who has the best looking house. In the end, it all doesn't matter because the kranks do not forget about the Christmas spirit when their daughter Blair comes homes out of the blue."
4,great book,"good book on cd arrived on time, jewel case for cd' is broken thatnis why I did not give it 5 stars but cd's work"
4,Short and sweet,"Read this for a December's meeting of a book club. Cute, sweet, short and an easy read. Just what we were looking for during the hectic month of December."
5,A Great Christmas Book,"I love this book. It's one of my favorites--up there with a Dicken's, ""A Christmas Carol."" I've read it several times over the years and highly recommend it."
1,"Did your ""A Painted House"" school boy write this one?","Trying to offset the agony of a huge, pre-Christmas airport line, I purchased this book in an airport bookstore at full price. At over ten-cents a page, I was determined to savor every word of this book. Unfortunately, this short story of near magazine thickness was one dimensional, predictable, and flat-out disappointing. Worse yet, I finished it before reaching the ticket counter! I felt taken having purchased this book. John, if you care anymore and are reading these reviews, please do us all a favor and spend some time on your next one!"
1,Diversity?,"I was completely offended when I read this book. I guess there isn't anyone of the Jewish or Muslim faith in the author's neighborhood. I won't even expand on the ""dark skin"" comment."
3,mindless reading,"I have not read more than 1 or 2 John Grisham books so it wasn't his writing that drew me to this. It was that this book had stayed as #1 on the best seller list for so long. After reading it, I think the reason the book spent so long on that list was due to the author name, not the book itself. It was an easy little read - never really challenging the reader's thought process, an appropriate book for sitting in the waiting room of your local dentist's office. I do believe if this story had been submitted by an unknown author, it probably would have been returned with a rejection note stating - ""nice little story - plot line needs more development"".I fully expect to see this whole story in some made-for-TV Christmas special starring Dan Akroyd by the end of 2002. So, if you are looking for a relatively quick escape from reality and just want to read what amounts to a sit-com in a book, enjoy, relax and have at it (or wait for the TV special)!"
2,Predictable Holiday/Hollywood Drivel,"If you're looking for a predictable schmaltzy holiday tale with a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" ending -- then this is for you. However if you want more from a book than a movie-of-the-week story that telegraphs the ending from about p. 10, then I'd suggest skipping ""Skipping Christmas"". After ""A Painted House"" I had high hopes for Grisham's new direction in his fiction. This, however, is a sad back-slide -- one wonders if it even would have been published if it didn't have such a ""bankable"" name on the cover. This read more like a movie script than a novel -- and unfortunately, I can see Hollywood probably casting it already."
4,a nice quick read,I thought the book was funny and a very nice read. It's only 177 pages and I was able to read it over the weekend. It's one of those books you start and can't stop. Very enjoyable.
5,FIVE THUMBS UP,"The audio version of this book was great. Well read and funny. A humorus Christmas story that captures human nature. Would make a good Christmas season TV movie. Great set-ups and finishes. Good, clean, wholesome entertainment. Recommend CD for audio."
3,K's Review,"Skipping Christmas is a really good book. It is short and to the point. Has a wonderful twist at the end and is heartfelt and enjoyable. I will say it is not the most interisting most adventurious or most gripping books i've read, but I really did enjoy it. I could sit down and read it in a day. The reader doesn't do much thinking in this book, but on a large scale the issue at hand makes a suprising impact. (Especially since i read it on December 3rd) The characters are delightfully average and really hit home. Like i said before i liked this book. It was corkey, fun, and an overall nice story."
1,Skipping Christmas,"Imagine if someone decided not to celebrate Christmas. That's right no tree, no decorations, no presents. Of course, millions either don't celebrate Christmas or do so in a non-materialistic fashion every year. But, what a concept. No Christmas lighting. Wouldn't the neighborhood go crazy. Of course, relatively few people cloak their homes in garish holiday excess. But what about all the parties. Someone would have to be a real scrooge to fail to provide gifts and engage in robust drinking with one's office-mates for Christmas. Of course, few businesses still sponsor a holiday party and even fewer provide alcohol or gift-giving opportunities.Grisham relies on the broadest and most simple-minded holiday sterotypes to serve up a simple-minded and broad message. Nearly as meaningful and authentic as a mall Santa."
1,Skip This,"I had to read this for a book group. The first part of the book brought up many issues such as non-conformity, group think, commercialism of the holiday....but the second half fell totally apart and there they were, right back in the thick of it, and very happy that their future son in law wasn't too dark. It read like a screen play, and read like the author had to write it. Im sorry he did, and Im sorry I had to read it.By the way, if he is really going to skip Christmas, why not go the week or two before? Thats when the craziness is the worst. A story of spending Christmas on a cruise ship could actually have been a very interesting one."
1,Ridiculous!,"I thought this book was ridiculous and hardly worthy of one of my favorite authors. It is barely more than a glorified short story. I really enjoyed A Painted House, which was a departure from the usual, and was looking forward to something perhaps similar. What a disappointment!"
3,Not Too Bad,"First book written by Laura Joh Rowland that I've read. As a lover of mystery and history, I was quite intrigued by the story of a Japanese 17th century investigator under the ruling of a shogun. Basically Sano Ichiro, our courageous and justice obsessed investigator, is instructed by the shogun, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, to find out who murdered his concubine, Lady Harume. That's the main plot; there are other sub-plots for Sano to figure out as well. The author gives detailed descriptions about 17th century Japan; the customs, the people and the harsh life which awaits the women. It's not that hard to figure out the murderer and I enjoyed reading the book. However the sex scenes could be cut down; does nothing for the story."
3,A great mystery,"Let me start by saying that this book is a good mystery and I was really stumped as to who the murderer was. The book had a good story line and a wonderful aray of murder suspects and ""mix you up"" evidense. The one thing that I found is that it did have alot of sex in it and it also had ""man love"". If you don't handel that kind of stuff, don't reads this book! It is not for you! If you can handel that and like a good mystery, then by all means, read this book."
4,Better than the third with expanded characters,"I liked this one better than the third book. Sano is back home and getting married. Of course as soon as he is married he is called to investigate the death of one of the Shogun's concubines. I like this story. Rowland expands the characters of Sano and his sidekick Hirata, she also adds the character of Reiko as his non-submissive, untraditional wife. The addition of other characters in Sano's inner circle and adding depth to them adds to the story. The same adding of characters also threatens to take away from the overall series because along with Reiko other characters are also added. You can see the possibility of having too many characters coming into a story and making it more confusing or convoluted. But for this book it works. I give it a B on the StuPage."
3,Not my Favorite...by a long shot,"While the Concubine's Tattoo, is well written and is as much of a time machine for the reader as the earlier books in this series, the detail of sexual perversions and obsession, is not my cup of tea, and for most of the book, while not bad enough for me to quit reading mid story, I found myself speed reading to get through to the end, not savoring the experience of the story at all.My advice is to skip this volume and go straight to The Samurai's Wife which is a much better story."
2,This Novel has an Identity Crisis,"In her fourth book in this series, Ms. Rowland had once again captivated readers with a richly textured mystery that's filled with intrigue and historical flavor. The glamor of feudal Japan and its social fabric will never cease to fascinate me. That being said, it would seem that Ms. Rowland can't decide in this book whether she's writing mystery-suspense or cheap, dime store erotica. Although some explicit scenes are necessary to drive the story along and delve into the background and motivations of certain characters in the story, Ms. Rowland nonetheless had overindulged in the perverted, dysfunctional ""social mores"" and undercurrents of feudal Japan. To what extent they are true, of course, is very much open to debate.I hope Ms. Rowland's future novels would keep its focus in mind. This is Mystery-Suspense in a historical setting, not Erotica."
4,"Good story, but not if you like your mysteries asexual","Laura Joh Rowland develops her characters throughout the series, so you might want to start with an earlier one (Shinju, for example) to get a feeling for the characters. This novel develops some of the minor characters such as the ruling family, and the story moves along well even though you are treated to the usual lavish detail about everything going on.That said, this story revolves around sex in ways some of the earlier ones didn't. From the first page you're invited into some pretty intimate situations, some of them more kinky than you expect. Some readers will be offended, others will not."
1,Yawn,"Zzzzz....zzzz....Yeah, yeah. You guys are tough, blah blah. Just get on with it. What a friggin' bore."
2,Full moon in one night?,Mickey and his pals have to get to a party before the moon turns from a crescent to a full moon. It takes place in one night! How is this scientifically possible? (The moon doesn't change from a crescent to a full moon in one night.)
1,Title Is Misleading,"I bought this for a children's Halloween party, and I was disappointed to find out that only the first cartoon is about Halloween. The other two Cartoons have nothing to do with Halloween. Also, the DVD was defective and the bonus feature did not work. Very annoying."
5,Mickey Mouse CD,My two year old niece loves Mickey Mouse Ha House. This is now her favorite movie to watch in the car.
4,"Good DVD, but only one new episode","There are three episodes on this DVD, but only the Halloween one is new. The other two have previously aired on The Disney Channel.There is also a bonus Little Einsteins episode, which is always a plus!"
5,Favorite Clubhouse Episodes,"We have a LOT of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs.But, this is by far my kids' favorite one.As with all the Mickey Clubhouses, it is a nice calm cartoon that doesn't make the parents want to wear ear plugs.Two thumbs up."
5,Adorable!,"Robeez are the cutest little shoes! I got some for my daughter when she was an infant, and now I got the Sailboat ones for her little brother! They are so cute, and the leather is soft and comfortable too."
2,Too much about salem,"I bought this book after watching the series Sabrina The Teenage Witch on TV. This was disappointing and I gave up halfway. It is so boring, especially since it was about Salem. I want to read about Sabrina. The next time i buy a Sabrina Book, I will make sure that it has got story about sabrina. This Go Fetch! is totally boring. yawn! About how Salem and Gotham travel through the 'LINE' and then went past garbage piles and the foul smells. The author should write better books !"
2,"Boooooring, Slow paced","To much about Salem and not enough with Sabrina. Other Sabrina books had better story lines. This book was written by D.&B. Weiss who also wrote Good Witch, Bad Witch which I didn't like that much either. If they want the books to be consistently good they should get one good writer. I did like ""Ben There Done That"" and ""Showdown at the Mall"" so don't give up on the whole series."
3,Something of a disappointment,"I expected this book to be excellent, given its subject and authors, but I was disappointed with it. Like many books about Himalayan expeditions, Shishapangma focused on disagreements within the team. But whereas in other cases this has been amusing or affecting, here it seemed dreary, and unfortunately tinged with misogyny. The climbing itself is described in rather dull terms; one gets little sense of excitement or danger. Scott's informational/philosophical postscripts may actually be the best part of the book. Don't read this one unless you're studying the route or are a real completist."
1,have not receaved,I have not gotten this item yet and there for can not give a review as far as if I like it or not. Maybe once it finaly does come in then I will put in a new review about the product.
4,Good study guide,"This guide helped bring my score up. There are some things I really liked about it and some things I really hated about itLiked- Started at the very basics and worked your way up.Disliked- Didn't explain all of the problems. If you got them wrong you had to figure why yourself (typical math book skipping steps) and there were a lot of mistakes in the bookOverall, if you have forgotten everything you learned in 7th and 8th grade math get this guide it will really help you prepare for the GRE's"
2,Too general to help on the GRE.,This book does a good job of teaching you basic math. It does help if you want to relearn math from scratch with progressive difficulty. It does not however help to prepare you specifically for the math questions encountered on the GRE. The practice questions in the book do a poor job of emulating GRE math questions which are not straight forward. I did every practice question in the book over three months and raised my quantitative score marginally. I studied a math review from a major test prep company and saw a much more appreciable gain using their specific advice. Using this book ended up being a tremendous waste of my financial resources and time. This book is a good math review but poor test prep - avoid it.
4,"Excellent content, awful layout",I must say this book is much more thorough than the Kaplan math review. My one complaint is that the thickness and layout of the book is a bit overwhelming at times and makes it that much more difficult to tackle the coursework. The Kaplan book is more user-friendly and makes it much easier to get through the work. If you don't have a lot of time do the Kaplan book because it's easier to get through the information faster because the layout is more compact. BUT this book is a bit more thorough so if you can ignore the thickness of the book because of super wide margins and such (great for good scratch work but makes it seem more overwhelming than it really is).
3,Good for beginners,This is mainly for people who are out of touch with math concepts for a long time. Really helpful for such people but will add little value for people who are looking for some advanced concepts and other tricks
5,"Not a toy, but great for storage!","I don't have a Winnie the Pooh one, but I do have a ladybug and a dolphin, and they are identical in design to this one. I use one for my son's soft toys and another for his dirty clothes. They are fantastic because they have infinite storage uses, they are too cute, and they become completely flat for ease of storage. Take care when putting objects with pointy edges in because they may tear. And I'm not sure why this is listed under toys, but it is certainly NOT a toy and I wouldn't give this to your child to play with. I'm not sure I would pay the list price for this, but I got mine at $4 each and was very happy with my money spent."
5,Great fit and a great bargain,"I highly recommend these gloves. I put 2400 miles on these gloves in 7 days, when they were brand new and had never been worn. The build quality was good and the gloves still look like new after my trip. I ordered extra large size for my extra large hands. They're easy to get on and off, and yet still give me a perfect feel for the Electra Glide's handle bars. The fit was great, the ventilation was great, and I felt the skid protection was exactly at the level I expected from fingerless gloves. They have plenty of leather right where I need it, it the palm, and not too much between the fingers etc. where it would get in the way. The mesh top is nice and thick, had no issues with fraying etc., and probably would provide at least some protection in a road-rash situation. The colors went very well with my black & silver Tour Master jacket."
5,Still Puttin' It Down,"Chris Staples is my favorite artist to date and though he's no longer with Twothirtyeight he's still puttin' it down. Personally ""Green Eyes"" and ""Halves That Make Us Whole"" have to be the best songs on the album. ""Call It In The Air"" is the A-side of ""Psychology"" while the rest have the 'Heart on his sleeve' feel. Overall I would say the entire album is a great listen from begining to end. Now all I need is a show date here in Seattle."
4,Price was good.,The price was good. The cd-rs work just fine. The only complaint I have is that the advertisement said color and they were all white! I guess I was expecting different colors!
4,I can't understand why so few people like this anime...,"I think this series is great so far. It's action-packed and the characters are interesting. There's comedy and suspense, and big robots, but not TOO many big robots. It has a storyline that keeps you guessing and wanting to know more.I've seen the first two dvd's (10 episodes) and I'm anxiously awaiting the third volume to see what happens next. I recommend this series to anyone who appreciates a good, quality anime. I hope that in the future more people become familiar with this title because it deserves more fans."
3,Lacking sequel,"I read the first book and i found it to be really good so when i bought the sequel to it, i figured it would be as good as the first one. I can't say that it was truly horrible or anything of that sort, but i felt that it was lacking some flare. I did manage to finish reading it through and that cinderella like story is kinda interesting, but still, there is something missing which is apparent. Overall though, it was just eh, ok."
4,"Not like the first one, but not too bad","After having just finished this book, I would have to say that it isn't that bad. True, Stackpole did abandon the hero from the first novel, but it is explained why in the afterword. He did expand upon the previous characters rather nicely in this novel however. The main character here, Len Fong, could be anyone who ever day dreamed about being transported to the fantasy world they read everyday. I liked the way he put Fong in the world and left him there till the end. He didn't flip back and forth between worlds. All in all I would have to say its a buy. I do hope he continues the series as well as his Talion series. Keep up the good work Stackpole!!!"
3,THIS WAS A SEQUAL TO A HERO BORN?,"THIS BOOK IS A FAIRLY GOOD ONE. HOPEFULLY, YOU ARE NOT EXPECTING TO READ ABOUT THE SAME MAIN CHARACTER. THE MAIN ONE IN THIS ONE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE FIRST BOOK. THE ONLY REALLY PITTIFUL PART IS THE VERY END. SO IF YOU LOOSE IT WITH JUST A FEW PAGES LEFT, DO NOT LOOK FOR IT."
3,a question to Mr Stackpole,"Although, the concept and the idea of the book are very intriguing; the storyline has a lot of gaps which makes the details somewhat confusing. "" ! warning a spoiler a head ! "" A question to Mr Stackpole. If Xoayya has a vision where she's is getting married and Len is at this wedding. How is Len going to return to Realms of Chaos to attend that ceremony if he was send to Earth? Plus, why is the description on the back cover talks about Locke and how he ""must become the very hero that he seeks"" when Locke only enters the storyline ten pages before the end of the book ?"
1,Boo,I loved the first book in the series but I could not even finish this one it was a great dissapointment how he modernized the story.BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
1,Disappointment,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series and anxiously bought this one expecting to like it just as much. The only reason I was able to sit down and get through it was because Stackpole is one of my favorite authors. I was quite surprised that he wrote this book. The first thing that told me that I would end up hating it was when a guy from our time was somehow swept into the Realm of Chaos time. Big mistake. I would like to see another book written in this setting, but nothing like this one."
3,"Pink ,Metal, Cutie...Kurumi..","I have seen mostly all the episodes including the second series I would say this is no childrens anime unless it was edited (because of nude robots). Kurumi is well to be exact, the leader of all three main Steel Angels. These angels live from a powerful sorce called Angel Heart, Kurumi has dedicated her life into protecting a young boy who she calls master, This series is cute and if youre into ""Magical Girl"" types then just and this to youre collection. By the way I meant to give it 3 and a half stars."
4,Full of Typos!,"This collection of poetry by Pablo Neruda is excellent. However, due to the many typos in both English and Spanish, I will give this 4 stars. Typos usually annoy me greatly, but this is such a good collection that I just mark corrections in my book and keep going. It would have been much better if the content had been proofread more carefully, however. Perhaps it wasn't proofread at all..."
3,I wanted to love it.,"It was such a great premise for a book-- what if the Babbage had realized his analytical engine and successfully created computer much earlier in our history? It was also encouraging that two of my favorite writers were involved. Unfortunately, _The Difference Engine_ never really delivers on its astounding amount of promise and the resulting book, while readable, does not hold together terribly well.Three sets of very different lives intersect when they all come in contact with a mysterious box of punch cards. Mix in an alternative history, lady Ada Babbage (with echos of Moorcock's Gloriana), and a staggering richness of detail and you have the book itself.Unfortunately, it often felt like a huge amount of talent in search of a plot. The detailing was perfect, the characters were great, but the story just never came together.Too bad."
4,Worth it for imagery alone,"The vividness with which the authors bring the Victorian computational machinery to life has stuck with me since the book first came out. I can still feel the clackers computing in their warehouses and feel the whoosh of pneumatic data. Tie-ins to such wonderful gizmos as the Jacquard loom provide an appropriate scientific backdrop. It's also short and easy to read, definite assets in my opinion; in this way, it contrasts with books by authors such as Vernor Vinge or even Greg Bear (the latters Blood Music excepted), who also introduce wonderful new societies situated among thought-inspiring technical gizmos. The pitting of London against Paris is more in the style of Agatha Christie than John Le Carre; surely an intentional move which gives the book a nice uncomplicated feel."
3,Good concept and pointless execution,"Like many postmodern novels, this one started with a great concept: imagine if steam and not silicon had been the conduit of our digital empowerment, and computers had taken over society back in the Victorian age. Add to this some cookie-cutter characters, cheap drama and a ""complex"" interlocking plot that forgets that the best part of complexity is a clear, simple motive under layers of deception, and you have four hundred pages of stuff that reads OK but is not compelling at all. I would not recommend this book to anyone. People who wish to explore Gibson should start with ""Neuromancer"" or ""Pattern Recognition"" or ""Burning Chrome,"" and possibly end there."
3,A Difference (Engine) Without A Difference,"This is a fascinating idea of alternate history wrapped in a tedious, poorly constructed story, possible because it was going to be a series of novels (not that that would have made it any better). The major part is given to a character, Mallory, who is uninteresting and totally unsympathetic, a chauvinist of the worst kind (racial, gender, social). The authors can't seem to decide who they admire, while the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys both demonstrate low morals and police state mentalities. The two authors badly needed a strong editor to pare this down to a meaningful tale."
3,Not About Computers?,"There is a review posted here from someone on May 11 of 1997 summarized as ""Par Excellence No Matter What Anyone Says"". The reviewer makes a point of saying that this is the best cyberpunk novel ever written and ""there's not a computer in sight"". I would simply like to point out that Babbage's Difference Engine was a steam powered mechanical computer, and that the entire story revolves about a program written by Ada Lovelace for that computer. The central character of the novel is a computer. Just pointing out that not only are computers in sight in this novel, they are a hopelessly pervasive element of every part of the novel: without Babbages mechanical computer, there wouldn't even be a title for the book."
1,Not what I wanted,"Well, I'll try to be fair, but it is hard. My reaction after reading the last page was ""Well, I'll never get that time back"". I can possibly see why some might find this book entertaining, if they were VERY familiar with 19th century history. The detail is very good, and the premise is interesting. However, I have not read many books I have been more disapointed in. It drags, meanders, teases, and finally... leaves you completely flat. IMHO don't waste your time."
3,"Not bad, but many missed opportunities","This isn't a bad novel, and I don't think it ""drags"" as some would have it--there is enough motive force behind the novel (action, plot development) to keep you there, BUTThe main character just isn't particularly interesting and the novel fails to flesh out its alternative history in a way that would make it truly intersting. We get a smattering of the catastrophist/gradualist controversy (derived from SJ Gould is my guess), and Victorian social attitudes and mores get depicted (but not discussed) pretty well.However, we don't get very much on the difference engines or how the technology interacts with Victorian society or on why Byron would have made a successful prime minister in these circumstances or . . .Well, we could go on at length as to topics the two novelists might have turned their attention to.But at the end of the day, not a bad way to spend a few days away from more serious reading."
2,I was not impressed,"Many people enjoyed this book for richness of detail, for complexity of storyline, for depth of research into the 19th century. Yes, all those elements were present. But the reason Gibson is popular is that his books usually offer a gripping and interesting plot. You may have to reread the books to catch everything, but you are swept up in the action the first time around anyway.This book was written to show that Gibson and Sterling have done a lot of research and think deep thoughts, NOT to tell an interesting story. The plot was boring. And that pretty much summarizes the book. Plenty of details, plenty of atmosphere, no story. Anne Rice can sometimes get away with this, and maybe Gibson alone could have pulled it off, but the story-by-committee idea just did not work out."
3,It should have been better...,"When I first heard that this book was in progress, I was excited. First, two of my very favorite authors were collaborating. Second, it was based on a what-if premise that fascinated me. I was expecting something not merely good, but Insanely Great.Alas, this time the sum turned out to be less than the sum of its parts. What I had hoped to see was a book combining the strengths of the two authors: the vision of how technology changes humanity that is Sterling, and the gripping storytelling of Gibson. What came out instead seemed to combine the weaknesses of the authors, especially Sterling's inability to end a story well.For all that, it's not a BAD book; these guys just plain write too well for that, and they do manage to present some interesting visions of this altered-past society."
2,"well drawn, but too clever by half","An alternate future past of 19th century England is thorough and believable. The intricacies of plot trip over themselves trying to be cryptic though and ultimately it wasn't a very satisfying read. Many plot lines and alternate histories are supposed to converge, but I really don't think that they do. Imagine the deliberate muddiness of Pynchon but with neither the underlying purpose or humor. Despite liking Gibson's other (admittedly opaque) work, if I had it to do over again I wouldn't have read this book."
1,bored,"A good novel pulls you in. It makes you care about the characters and gives you a mystery you desperately want to see resolved. This novel is BORING. It's not just a ""slow start"" it is 100 pages of dull, dingy bordome. If the author cannot hook me in one hundred pages, it's time to toss it aside and try the next one."
1,Unfulfilling,"I'm a Gibson fan, but this book left me high and dry. Very weak story line, and somewhat sketchy background. Perhaps I would have understood it better if I were a native on London and a student of Victorian history. But I doubt I would have enjoyed it much more. There was just no ""there"" there, and that was terribly disappointing, because Gibson usually makes me think. This time, all he did was put me to sleep."
1,Why Bother? I saw no Difference.,"As I plowed through this story, I alternately had feelings of amazement and bewilderment. The authors' over indulgence in festooning us with fine details that were pretty much gratuitous, while totaling forgeting about telling us a story with some sort focus or meaning, was quite annoying. Though not expecting Sci-Fi on the level of Asimov, Clarke or any other of the demi-gods of Sci-Fi, I did expect a story that could at least hold its own within its own universe"
2,A slow read...,"I'm a complete geek and avid reader of hard sci-fi. I like ""Neuromancer"" from William Gibson, ""In the Beginning..."" and ""Diamond Age"" from Neal Stephenson, and ""Diaspora"" and just about everything else from Greg Egan.But I can't recommend ""Difference Engine"" by Bruce Sterling. The ideas behind the story are good. His descriptions are visibly good, but it reads neither like a good story, nor like a tech manual.The problem isn't isolated to this book either. ""Artificial Kid"" also reads slowly. I can't even pinpoint exactly what it is, other than Bruce Sterling's writings are VERY slow to read and hard to stay focussed on the story."
2,Viva la difference,"A fascinating yarn woven around the idea that Babbage's ""difference engine,"" the precursor to the computer, was put together despite the actual limitations of the time. Using real historical figures-- many of whom are forgotten--Gibson and Sterling depict a London of the 1800s which is heavily polluted and corrupted by ""thinking engines."" Gibson's style and prose are surprisingly dulled in this collaboration, whereas Sterling's ecological and sociological ideas abound. The work is not for everyone, but whenever you are starved for some original Gibson or Sterling, then give this book a whirl."
3,Rich detail and images - betrayed by a weak ending,"The novel is captivating in the richness of the picture that is developed of an English society delaing with both the industrial revolution - and an information revolution at the same time.I was in love with the novel, its characters, and story lines. Right until the end.While I think I get some of the ways the story lines were wrapped up - the end of the novel left me with more unanswered questions than messages or issues to think about. I needed more and was disappointed."
2,"great cinematography, poor acting","A tour-de-force in which an incredible imaginary world is created for no apparent reason. ""Full of sound & fury, signifying nothing."" The detail is breathtaking, the archaic vocabulary is a bit belabored, the characters are two dimensional and could have been lifted from much mediocre Victorian / Edwardian fiction. Like many other reviewers I was very disappointed with the lack of plot and ending."
2,Very dull,Very slow and very dull. The only interesting bit was the heroes' journey into the slums of London.
4,Effort is rewarded...,"This is hard to read; I almost didn't finish it the first time aroundOn re-reading it, I started to appreciate the alternate history Gibson and Bearhave created; it helps to have a passing acquaintance withBritish history and computing history, otherwise large chunks make almost no sense whatsoever.Overloaded with detail, with an ending that appearsto leave the most intriguing plot strand unresolved, the book still manages to evokethe feel of Victorian society through the characters use oflanguage and behaviour, so different from our own. I also liked the appearance ofDisraeli, a nice touch.Well worth the effort, and fires the imagination of what could have been.."
3,Calculating what might have been,"Although it's not common knowledge, the first working computer was designed in the mid-nineteenth century by one Charles Babbage. It worked on gears and clockwork rather than vacuum tubes or semi-conductor chips. The computer was never actually built though.This book is an alternative history exploring what would have been if Babbage's difference engine had been built and attained widespread use. The book lacks a strong plot or sympathetic characters, being primarily an exploration of milieu. The society Sterling & Gibson describe is mildly dystopian. For those of you who are math geeks, G?del's incompleteness theorem makes an appearance towards the end. It was a fascinating trip. The only part that really annoyed me was the extended prostitution scene right in the middle of the book."
3,A conflict of writing styles,"It had the *makings* of a great novel... two of the greatest modern SF writers, applying the tools of today to a previous century. But. But. See, both Gibson and Sterling, at that point in their careers, had distinctive mechanisms for storytelling at the novel length. Gibson's mechanism was parallel plotlines, three or four stories going at once that bound together at the end (see Count Zero). Sterling's mechanism was long temporal jumps, where something happened, and then something else happened twenty years later, then ten more years, and so on (see Schizmatrix). Combined, you get parallel plotlines going on over long stretches of time - a terribly, terribly confusing way to write! It was nearly impossible to follow the individual characters and their stories, because things jumped around so much.And it's a shame, because it was SUCH a great idea."
2,"Clunk, Clunk, Clunk, Crash!","This text is so filled with irrelevant detail, and the plot so slow, that even in this revised edition, it is difficult to generate any interest in the story itself. Although the story revolves around the intriguing premise of Babbage's engines achieving a pervasive historical prominence, this premise alone is not nearly enough to sustain this work. The Difference Engine ultimately falls prey to its own overcalculated storyline."
3,"Not bad... but not great, either.","The concept of the Victorian era transformed by Babbage engines has really come of age, now that a _real_ Difference Engine has been constructed after Babbage's design. Therefore, I was really excited to get my hands on the book--- and disappointed when I finished devouring it.Yeah, the concepts were there, and it started out as interesting, but the book soon became a muddled and tiresome exercise in trying to get to the end. Not only was the plot unclear, but the details just bogged down the story (although the story may not be the main point with fiction of this kind). Some cool stuff, definitely-- if you're a fan of the authors, read it-- but it just didn't grab me. I'm relieved to see I wasn't the only one. To be entirely fair to the authors, though, I wasn't up on my 1800's history enough to know what was historical and what was alternate-timeline."
2,A neat idea that never finds a voice,"Being a big Gibson fan (less so of Sterling, thought Islands in the Net was a waste of time), I liked the premise of this one a lot but wow what a disappointment. There is no real storyline, just a pointillist outline of a world where the computer revolution happens in the steam age, and the story, such as it is, flounders and flops until suddenly in the last page the writers decide to call it a day.It doesn't wrap up, it doesn't conclude, it simply stops. I can't recommend this book.Great premise, execution failure."
2,Boring,"I am a fan of William Gibson, I read a lot of good book written by him and find that he is a very interesting author.I originally bought that book a long time ago, then I lent it to a friend, before reading it. I had forgotten who I lent the book to, but I remembered having purchased it it the past.A few years later, I gave up on finding the book and bought it once again, being intrigued about the premise of a high tech in the not so distant past and all that.While I read it, I did not find that the storyline adequately answered my expectations. It reminded me of the sort of thing I use to watch in a cheap 30 minutes animated character television program when I was a kid.I was bored, I did not like it. Maybe its just my science fiction side that was screaming for the alternate universe where computers (even based on steam engine) appeared about 100 years ago that was disapointed. Can't argue against the characters, the rest of the storyline fits well on its own, it just does not appeal to me."
2,Opportunity Lost,"I started this book 3 years ago and put it down because the dialog and the slow pace was not what I was looking for at that point. I started it again this week and finished it. I still think the authors could have cut out about 150 pages and not lost anything.The book does deliver some interesting alternate history ideas. The new roles of historical figures kept me reading. I felt as though the authors had a great setting for this book and ample opportunity but somehow chose the dullest story line possible.Although I read the book fairly carefully and understand much of the underlying message, I still get the impression that the authors meant for me to see more than what I did. If they did, I didn't get it because the execution of the story was just so monotonous it was distracting. I would have to read the book again to better understand the ending. I think I'll wait another few years."
3,Like Flashman but with USB Ports,"PROS- Required reading for steampunk fans. If you like descriptions of technologies that include words like phenakistoscopes, quassia and crenellation, than this is your book- Main character Edward ""Leviathian"" Mallory is a retro-futurist rock star.- The Great Stink account is breathtaking adventure. Very well written- Seamless integration of historical fact and science fantasy fiction. Did the karakuri Japanese automatons really exist?- Raises interesting questions about our own information-age societyCONS- The dozen-odd chapters in the Modus section (e.g. ""In the Time of Troubles"" and ones that are postscript ""Memorandum from the Foreign Office"") should have been placed in the beginning as opposed to the ending to orient the reader. I'd recommend starting with this section first, then moving onto Chapter 1. The book will make a lot more sense.- The Sam Houston character is extraneous"
3,Plot weaves but doesn't quite intersect,"The authors have done a great job in creating a fanciful 1855 Britain which has gone through a technological and social revolution as a result of the success of Babbage's differential engine, a mechanical computer which in reality was never perfected but had enormous potential. Whether that potential, as portayed in the book, would have resulted in digital photography and a national credit card system I'm not certain. The authors are great at creating characters and plausible scenes but the reasoning behind much of the plot is a bit dodgy. Still, a good read."
1,Absolute crap!,"I have to agree with virtually everyone else who reviewed this book. It is horrible. The book reads like Sterling and Gibson came up with a concept, divided up the chapters and never checked in again. The early characters disappear and sort of reappear at the end. I kept reading, hoping that it would all come together at the end, but it didn't. In fact, the last section left me completely mystified.I took this with me on a business trip to the middle east and read it on my return flight. I was hoping for an engrossing read that would make the remaining trip enjoyable. Instead, I experienced the longest flight of my life as I slogged through this mess."
1,very disappointing,"This book sounded like such a good idea when I first heard about it. Unfortunately, the execution was horrible. I can only assume that there was conflict or poor planning between Gibson & Sterling. The characters were boring and there were many pages and even chapters that could have been ripped out without anyone noticing. The plot sputtered through the whole novel and eventually just died about 50 pages from the end. Overall it was confusing and unfulfilling, and I felt that the unique setting and story idea was wasted on a failed collaboration between two writers that are used to being on their own."
1,Vaguely related vignettes masquerading as a novel,"Two of today's best science fiction authors collaborate on a fascinating concept and produce...a book with no discernable plot, no central characters, no apparent theme or message, and as if that wasn't bad enough already, it has no ending, but simply stops at a more or less arbitrary point. One of the biggest disappointments of recent years."
2,Lots of blah with no payoff,"I'm not trying to make myself sound like an idiot, but this book was just too full of 19th century jargon for me to be able to comfortably read it. I seriously had to keep dictionary.com up and ready while reading. I read it cover to cover and never did feel like I got much out of it, except perhaps a rather bland story. I've never read anything else by Sterling, but I've read other Gibson works. While Gibson does always tend to use unfamiliar terms, some of which Id swear he makes up, this book takes the cake. I would read 5 boring pages of rather useless information and wonder where in the world they were going with it! It was a frustrating experience to read this book and I'm just glad I'm done with it. I'm giving it 2 stars because of all of the painful, and presumably accurate detail they conveyed throughout the book. If your really into all things 19th century or steam-punk, then Id recommend it."
2,All dressed up with nowhere to go...,"Having read several other books by both Gibson and Sterling, I expected something much better than this. The idea of the information age arriving a century early in Victorian England made for an irresistable ""what if...?"" Well, control yourself because this is a totally unrealized vision. Their eye for detail and potential effects of mechanical computers in the 19th. century are terrific and at times terrifying; unfortunately, this is all the book has to offer because there is little character development and I've yet to identify any sort of plot. I suspect the authors took on far too grand a concept that they either couldn't finish in a saleable format or within the publisher's deadline. In either case it's really too bad, because it's an idea deserving a more complete exploration. I suspect this would also make an excellent environment for a role-playing game. Charles Dickens meets GURPS cyberpunk."
1,Utterly pointless,"The idea and plot may sound interesting but don't be fooled. This is quite possibly the worst book I've every tried to read. I got about 75 pages in before putting it down in disgust, and even then I wish I hadn't wasted time on those 75 pages. This book is utterly pointless."
2,Interesting but distorts history,The idea of the invention of Steampowered computers in the nineteenth century is interesting but the author makes several unetanable claims of what would happen in the new timeline. The book says that the Mexican American War never happened and Texas is still independent. Yet the American Civil War happened even sooner than in our timeline and the South won. One of the causes of the Civil War was the dispute over whether the newly won territories captured in the war with Mexico would be free or slave states. If the war with Mexico never happens it stands to reason that the Civil War would be delayed or prevented all together. In the book Karl Marx is claimed to have seized control of New York City during the Draft riots during the Civil War and one of his followers is presented as a supporter of slavery. In the real history though Karl Marx supported the Union war effort and opposed slavery.
1,Inappropriate for US DVD Players,"I was terribly disappointed with this DVD. The advertising on AMAZON was not at all clear that the disk could NOT be played on US DVD players. It is not compatible with our format, and I think this should be absolutely clear on the website. It simply says FormatI cannot review the film in any way. I feel that the site implicitly misrepresented the disk. I have bee: PAL and ALL REGIONS. I now understand that the average customer is supposed to know from this that ""regions"" does not been all countries. It would have saved me time and annoyance if the incompatibility with US DVD players was clear."
2,ANTONIONI'S FOG,"This is one very late Antonioni's film from 1982, and he seems to be trying regain his sixties success. The film is in the best evaluation I can give a ok film. Very weak. Which surprised me Criterion giving it a try releasing it. All the magic is gone. If you watch Fellini's films in the eighties he also changed of course but his films always manage to be very interesting in their own way. But Identification of a Woman only have a scene of value, the fog scene which is a recycling of Deserto Rosso. I recommend it only for hardcore fans of Antonioni."
3,Minor Antonioni...,"This is an obscure, latter day film by Antonioni, the last one he made before suffering a stroke that incapacitated him, and left him with no voice. It's not a particularly memorable one. The only scene I vividly recall is a traffic jam scene where the protagonist (a film director) is searching for the said woman in the title on a fog shrouded freeway. It's an astonishing scene, but it's really the only memorable scene in a 132 minute film. Antonioni pretty much lost it after The Passenger (some have said he lost it after Zabriskie Point, which is definitely debatable), and while this film has such excellent Antonionish moments, it's not a really memorable film. A shame."
3,The Brits do Nationalist Socialism Decently,"Not surprisingly--it's all very understated. Actually--seeing this on TMC I was amazed how visually sophisticated this made for TV production looked. Very nice atmosphere and compositions (mise-en-scene!!!!). Not mounted as an adventure or for tension, but engaging nonetheless.John Shea is more than watchable. The same cannot be said of the transfer--which looks like a VHS copy projected through wax paper.Caveat Emptor!"
1,Flimsy,"The frame of the pump is so flimsy that if you dont pump very carefully, you will end up twisting the frame. Of course, you can easily twist it back into shape, but do this a few times and the product will simply fall apart in your hands.It's a shame they make such trash. Its an even bigger shame they ship this stuff all halfway across the world so that it ends up in a landfill site within a month.NOT RECOMMENDED. 0/5 stars"
1,Piece of junk broke on first use,"When I first opened this package, I noticed the item's box was beaten up. Hoping it was not a sign of the quality of the product I kept it anyway. When I first tried it, I noticed a hissing sound and the gauge didn't work. I got my front bike tire pumped up. On the back tire, the tube connecting the pump to the valve completely broke off. It was supposed to be screwed on, but the screw was too small for the hole. It wasn't stripped or anything but wouldn't stay put. Needless to say, I returned the item."
1,Not worth the money!,"These shears are expensive and do not hold up. I have used a lot of different types and brands of shears for work. These are not the pair to buy. They broke almost immediately and for the price, I would have liked them to last a lot longer."
3,Tepid fury without the typical Franco flair! But cool music,"Not one of Jess Franco's better films but certainly not one of his worst either. I would have liked to see this film directed by Franco but produced by his American company One Shot Productions. They would have trimmed a lot of the stale time and left us with pure Jess Franco. The story is pretty straightforward, espcially for a Franco film, with a rock band getting lost and winding up at the home a madwoman in search of human blood. Segura and Superstar are definitely the best elements of the film. The Killer Barbies music is especially hot! Kind of like having a female Joey Ramone singing the soundtrack. [Some trivia I learned in an interview: although this is not a One Shot Productions film by Franco, the head of One Shot Productions, Kevin Collins, actually gave the film its name when the actual producers realized that they might get sued if they called it ""Killer Barbies""!]"
5,Absolutely one of the finest books I have ever read!,"This is absolutely one of the finest books I have ever read! The story is told with a magical captiveness comparable to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings! This tale continuously left me wanting more! A beautiful story of the pre-St. Patrick Irish, Red Branch forever!"
5,Captivating jurney into Ireland's mythical history,"One can almost belive that they are sitting in the hall of Ulster's King listining to the Bards tell the tale like it had just happened. I can still hear the war cry of the Champion of Champions, Cuchulain, as he single handedly conqured an army. The devistating power of Deirdre's perfect beauty and a Kings ultimate betrayal, highten the experence. Mogan Llywelyn stole the Emerald out of the Island and polished it with Red Branch"
3,ALRIGHT,"got this because i needed it for class. hard to read as the text is heavily celtic influenced. but as a story, its pretty cool and catching. worth the read if its for class"
5,Ever wonder why your Irish Wife loves to fight?,"I love this book, I read it as a beginning of a diversity search... We have all this diverse cultural stuff thrown at us in the workplace in this age of political correctness, so I read some of Llywelyn's novels, to see where my family comes from. Boy did I get a better understanding of my wife! All that aside, this is a fascinating telling of one of Celtic Mythologies most exciting tales, the tale Cuchulain,the ""Hound of Ulster"", who might be seen as the Celtic Achilles."
2,Review of the first half,"I still haven't finished this one, I tried for a couple months tho. I usually finish a book like this in a week, max. I'm actually a great fan of the Tain and related tales but I just couldn't get into this book.Two stars because it isn't actually BAD, I didn't want to throw it away or anything and I actually would like to finish it, someday.Plodding is the best description I can think of. I did't care about the characters or the plot, I just got bored reading it."
5,The Best,"This was the 2nd CD I bought of theres, and I gotta tell you this is the best. ... Anyway this CD is like all there CDS mixed into one. They should continue doing this. The have improved greatly over the years. Defenately buy this. And Go see Star Wars"
2,i'm letdown,"I am a big fan of Mxpx, i have every cd. I didn't like this one.i bought ""take off your pants..."" and the renaissance ep at the same time, and forgive me for comparing the two, but i like the blink album much more. MxPx has been in the music game a long time, and have the capability to pull lots of tricks out of the bag; i recognized lots of those elements. however i didn't feel the same energy as in past albums. The songs on the renaissance ep are raw, but not catchy. i'm suprised at their choice to release on fat wreck, but i wish the songs had the same charm as before."
5,THE BEST !!!!,"Ah, now this is the CD I've been waiting for. It's like all there Cds mixed into one 9 song CD. The only bad thing is that it is to short. They are also Christian, so if you have over protective parents that think Pennywise, Nofx, and Greenday are bad, get this. This is a better CD anyway. Bands like Pennywise, nofx, and Greenday sing about depression, drugs, anarchy(which is the dumbest idea humans have evercome up with) and they just aren't for me. I don't think anyone should listen to them. Life is bad enough as it is, and we don't need people like them making things worse."
2,Poor Attempt,This is MxPx worst album since their early days of Pokinatcha. They have fallen apart after their peak during the days of Life in General / Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo. This cd could have been written and recorded in a couple of days. Having Mike mix the songs is really present in some songs where he drowns out the guitar and puts emphasis on his lyrics. Mxpx needs to not sell cds according to their name (Fat Wreck Chords) but because of music quality. Make me proud Tom Mike and Yuri. Oh yeah this stuff doesn't seem much harder except Track.
2,Kind of a let down,"When I heard MxPx was going back to their older style of earlier albums, I had to pick this up. One of the best punk bands out. I have all their albums including the controversial Ever Passing, which I didn't really care for. It seems like this EP is almost like that, with the exception of like two songs. It still doesn't sound like MxPx. Just because they add on two harder sounding old style punk songs, doesn't mean they're returning. They just aren't catchy, they sound the same. The first song I heard from this album, from their site, before it was released was ""Letting Go"". That's a good song, kinda like others, it's catchy. The others just sound the same and don't catch like previous albums. I don't know, it may be just me, but I thought ""Yuri Wakes Up Screaming"" is just a waste of time on the CD. Could've come up with a better song that. Kinda copying Slick Shoes with the title it seems. Hopefully they'll come out with better."
4,IT CAME FROM FAT WRECK!!,"This is a great album with some catchy songs, and great lyrics. For anyone who hasn't already gotten it, go get it's worth the money. Also MxPx are one of the best live bands I've ever seen and their really nice guys and really down to earth, I think it's stupid for people to slag them just because they belive in God, I mean does it really matter ? Anyway great album, one of my favorite MxPx albums(althougth I like all their albums)GREAT RECORD!!!!!!"
5,Ahh.....I love this one.,"The Renaissance is such an awesome album! I love Lonesome Town, Party, The Opposite, and Yuri Wakes up Screaming. I really recommend this album to anyone who is a MXPX fan. It rox!"
1,Getting Old...,"Mike (the singer) talked about how this is a sort of new sound for mxpx, a better change, and so on. I am very dissapointed with this for the simple reason that non of these songs are that good. Lyrically, they're just so-so, and musically, nothing stands out signifying how they have this new begining on this EP. For the die hard mxpx fans pick it up to add to your other cd;s but if not have a listen first or dub it from a friend."
1,Let Michaelangelo handle the Renaissance........,I thought Mike could have had a better job with the cover art on the book.
2,storyline and boxing choreography were fair; love nudity,movie was fair including the nude sequences and the boxing sequences
4,A collection of puzzles,"This book brings lot's of puzzles with answers, nothing more nothing else. I bought this book seeking for that. That's a good book."
5,Blends seamlessly with my Sony Wega KDFE55A20.,"This stand is pricey, but it looks REALLY nice in my home theatre. The stand actually encloses the base of the TV, and almost make it look as though the TV and stand are one piece of furniture. Very sharp looking! Perfect height for gaming and watching movies. Easy to put together.One warning... mine came through J&R; Music World, and the top piece was damaged by the packing straps which had cut into the box, and into the stand itself. Not sure if this was the manufacturer, vendor, or shipper's fault, but it took me almost two weeks to get my replacement top, and I had to send back the original first before they would ship the new piece. They wouldn't even discount the shipping and handling for my trouble.If I had it all to do over again, I would get the stand, but I would get it somewhere else."
1,Poor Communication of Ideas,The problems presented in this calculus text are childish at best. This text represents the downfall of modern calculus in today's society
4,"On the contrary, this textbook is excellent","I was surprised to see all the negative reviews of one of my favourite first-year textbooks. This must be one of the best textbooks I have ever used. I find it very clearly written, wonderfully illustrated, with lots of interesting asides. Although this is one of my first textbooks, I still often refer to it during the course of my engineering work."
3,"Not bad, but needs better explanations","This book was good for understanding the basics of all the concepts, but if you wanted to go more in depth, it was not a very good learning resource. The explanations were not very clear and detailed, and there were also not enough examples. Often, I felt that it would have been much more helpful to have detailed explanations of the more difficult problems."
2,"maybe I'm stupid, you tell me","I searched here for my Calculus textbook by ISDN#, when I found it I noticed that the page indicated there were ""Other editions: Hardcover, Paperback"". I thought, ""Excellent, I can buy my text as a paperback and save buckets of money"", so I clicked on the link to ""Paperback"" and ordered the book. To my chagrin, the book that arrived was NOT my text, but was instead a study guide. I feel deceived, I feel the link that I clicked should have been described as ""supplemental editions"" or something similar, since the paperback was not actually another edition of the same textbook."
3,Dempsey,"""Dempsey"" is a believable look at the life and times of Jack Dempsey, and the fight scenes are well-staged. RPD"
5,very thought provoking,emotions range the gamut from sublime happiness to great despair...very good read...a very good idea for a holiday gift...
4,More than just a plug,"I purchased more than just the plug. I purchased a complete call center suite. I had difficulty finding all the documentation and where to get customer service. After many tries, I connected with a great customer service representative and my problems (configuration) were solved. For Jabra/GN, use the telephone first and then the website if you need supplemental information.Here are their support numbers:For assistance with your GN products, please call our Support Specialists at 800-826-4656, press 2, and then option 2 again for office products. I was connected within a few minutes and my problem was resolved withing 5 minutes. My only concern is why did it not work directly out of the box like most products that I buy. The suite was purchased as such so it should have worked as soon as I plugged in the analog line."
4,Jabra 1005143 Netcom Qd To 2.5MM Stereo Plug,"I was very pleased to get a pair of Jabra earphones 2.5mm stereo plug. All earphones for my nano pod in Cyprus were of 3.5mm type but fortunately I found from Amazon this set of 2.5mm. Very good quality of sound, very convenient with its retractable earphones and it was delivered in reasonable time."
4,Resource Material,"If you are a fan of This Old House, then you probably want to get this magazine. If you have been watching the show for a long time (who hasn't?) then you will feel like you are reading a magazine about family, as there is usually something in each issue from each of the show's participants.The magazine offers more in-depth information about the projects you see on television. A big reason to get the magazine is to learn more about the materials used in the projects and where you can get them. In addition, there are projects covered in the magazine which are not done on the television series.While the magazine, in my opinion, is a bit short on exact specifics, or ""how-to's,"" one has to keep in mind that a lot of the attitude of the show seems to be ""use a professional."" While I can understand doing that if you have the financial resources, it just isn't always practical. Still, if you want to be informed when you do call the professionals, this is one way to do it."
2,Don't bother with this one.,"This is a magazine for paid product-placement in articles, tons of ads, and so-so articles. You are paying for the name, and getting much less in return.I HIGHLY recommendFine Homebuildinginstead of This Old House. You will not only see fabulous new and old construction, but actually take something away from it (that is the point behind magazines, right?) A magazine that actually saved me money!I'm cancelling my subscription to T.O.H. and adding another year onto my Fine Homebuilding subscription. It's money well spent."
2,Lots of Fluff...not much Stuff,"This magazine has lots of nice pictures.....but lacks the indepth articles that Fine Homebuilding or Fine Woodworking offers. Its basically a promotional of the long running tv series, and will disapoint anyone above a novice in construction."
2,Not much there.,"This Old House is published, naturally enough, as an adjunct to the popular PBS show, but it doesn't really offer much by itself. It's mostly a read-and-toss sort of magazine. If you're really interested in home building and remodeling, there are two far superior magazines: Fine Homebuilding and Old Home Journal. Each of them offers far more depth and useful information than This Old House, not to mention better photography and a wider range of topics. Fine Homebuilding in particular is a magazine you'll want to keep- and most readers do."
1,"Haven't received subscription, yet.","Amazon indicated that I would not receive this subscription because of processing until OCTOBER of this year. As this is AUGUST, I have not received the subscription yet and, therefore, cannot comment. Except to say, ""Why am I getting this opportunity to review a product I do not have?"""
1,Haven't received it,"I have not received first issue yet....not sure how long t takes, but will revise my rating when/if I do"
4,gift,"was enjoyed as was given as a gift that continues to give thru out the year, He was surprised and very pleased."
4,Always interesting,Like the television show there is always something interesting and informative in the magazine. I read every issue cover to cover.
4,Handyman helpful,A very well prepared magazine with loads of helpful hints and ideas. Worth the money.
2,It was not what I expected,"After seen ""This Old House"" in KPBS I thought the magazine would be great reading, filled with info, tools and their suppliers, projects, tips, etc.Unfortunately what I got is like a merchandising or advertising catalog. I would not recommend it, sorry!Dario"
2,They sold themselves out,"I had, repeat had been reading this magazine for ten years or so. Over that time they have really changed. I guess it started when they got a new editor four or five years ago. After that the adds changed from building suppliers to lexus ads. I don't like seeing automotive and home stereo ads in my how-to magazine. The information is more akin to Martha Stewart than it is Norm Abrams. Who by the way is hardly in there anymore if at all. Not to mention the new guy, A stray they picked up from ask this old house, what an opie taylor he is. What makes him eligible to write something for TOH magazine. I really miss Steve Thomas. The how-to's though somewhat informative really lack the intricate details. All I can say is thank god Tom Silva still puts in some minutia of his wealth of information. If you'd like a ""Better Homes and Gardens plus magazine"" then this magazines for you if you want to learn something try Fine Homebuilding or at the least Family Handyman."
2,"Ok magazine, not what I expected","I guess I was expecting more of a repair handyman type of magazine, but this is mostly an interior design color-matching type of magazine. Good if you like decorating ideas, bad if you like handy-man types of things. Go with Family Handy Man instead."
3,Eye candy,"I agree that Fine Homebuilding is the much better investment. You'll gain much more knowledge from watching TOH than reading this magazine. It's chock full of ads and lightweight articles and annoyingly short on reviews and product information. Half the people get this to be part of the TOH following, but to real do it yourselfers and knowledge hounds, the Taunton stuff is much better.TOH is a beautifully produced magazine but not much more than that."
3,OK but not as good as Handyman Magazine,"Bought this due to it being on sale, but have also read The Family Handyman Magazine. Handyman is much more useful for the average homeowner and provides much more information including automotive. The tips and ideas are much more realistic and practical. I felt that ""This Old House"" has more challenging projects that unless you have the expensive tools that fill your garage, you will probably not put 90% of what they publish to actual use."
5,quality DIY publication,what a great 12 month subscription for such an incredible price. Look forward to its arrival each month.
5,This Old House Magazine,"I love this magazine. It has wonderful how-to's and really great ideas for repairing things on homes that don't take away from their esthetics. Old House, new old looking porch, for instance. I recommend it to my friends who are interested in the classic old homes."
3,not worth it,"After reading several issues I am disappointed with the content. The title is misleading, This old house is not really that full of useful information for an experienced carpenter to use for an old house restoration or serious remodeling. I find it a bit boring and reminds me of magazines such as country living and handyman. actually handyman magazine is better.I do admit there are useful tidbits in the magazine about choices of prducts and would be useful for the novice. There is a lot of ads and little projects for those as well. If you want in depth knoweldge about the old house this is not it. The show was much better, this is a watered down attempt to make money from that. I will not renew."
3,This Old House Magazine Special,"I am surprised to be asked for a review for a product I haven't received. Ordered 12/15/10 on a special for $12 for a year. Plus Amazon was running $5 off. So, I paid $7 for it. Today is 1/18/10. What should I expect for $7?"
1,Pure Fluff!,"The magazine is absolute fluff! It is nothing more than advertisement. There are no real articles in this magazine. This Old House has turned into Martha Stewart Living, except Martha Stewart Living actually has useful articles! There are no DIY articles. There are no help articles. There are one sentence ""help"" blurbs from subscribers of dubious knowledge. The web site is much better. Save you money."
3,"well written, but lacks the grab of his other work","I'm not sure why, but 100 pages in to this book I'm just not into it. It just doesn't have that certain something that his other books have had. I've read I think 7 Kay books (wow, he may be my most-read author, but Dan Simmons is an up and comer in the rankings) and this is my least favorite."
3,"3.5 stars - Not Kay's best, but good","This was a good book and an enjoyable read. That being said, it is not Kay's best work. For that, look to Tigana, Lord of Emperors, and the Lions of Al-Rassan. In Last Light, the characters simply are not as fully realized as those in Kay's earlier works, with maybe the exception of Aeldred. Still, this is a Kay novel, and as such, the reader is treated to absolutely wonderful prose and an engaging plot. Still, if you want gorgeous prose, plots to make you weep, and characters you take to your heart, try the abovementioned Kay titles also."
3,Too much fantasy - not enough history,"There is probably nothing wrong with the book, if one treats it as a fantasy book. You'll find typical Kay's artistic and colorful descriptions, woven dialogues, knightly valor, and beautiful heroines. The story is based on the 9th century Britain, where Danes, Saxons, and Welsh are mingling in historical struggle to get upper hand on the Island. There is war, religion, sacrilege, romance, Vikings raids, and duels. But all the real stuff is intervened by fearies, ghost-like creatures and death-monsters. Maybe, the author is trying to portray early medieval England full of pagan beliefs and encroaching Christianity in a more sulky way that it should be. I guess, I would prefer to read about druids and druidism than about faeries and ghosts. I would also prefer to stick closer to historical events, but I guess author is doing what he is doing on purpose, because the fantasy genre requires magic and not reality."
4,Another good read from Guy Gavriel Kay,"His books are usually a pretty good read and this book is no exception. Engaging, well thought out characters drawn from history."
5,Gripping historical novel,"This is my third Kay novel (Tigana, A Song for Arbonne) and I have an extremely difficult time putting his novels down. This novel in particular seems to have raised the bar, with Kay now having to compete with our own understandings of the very historical parallels he seeks to evoke. I find his writing--or more correctly--his structure, to be similar to Milan Kundera, who has been a favorite of mine for decades. In this case there is a linear plot that provides an anchor for the novel, but just as important are several subplots that support an overarching theme and then tie together in the end. And that resolution in this case is satisfying. He takes risks with this book, but in my opinion both he and his readers win. Many thanks for a great and provocative read!"
4,read by the last light of the sun...,"Kay has been one of my favorite authors of fantasy works for the last 14 years. He tends to write stories told from several points of view at once, which creates a tapestry out of the story, rather than a single thread, and allows therefore for characters on both sides of a conflict to not get portrayed as ""good"" or ""evil"". Kay does his usual brilliant work again here, with a tale set in a land that bears a resemblance to England in the Dark Ages. Amusingly enough, I finished the story by the last light of the sun on the 23rd of February, 2008."
2,Dull and uneventful,"First, I usually love Guy Kay's work and have read everything he's written. And this book is Kay--it puts you in the past, makes you feel the world as it was believed to be, the magic and gods truly living and influencing the world. But, unfortunately, not much is happening in that world. Too many characters are introduced it's hard to keep track of people, and takes longer to get to like anyone.I'd say if you liked all his work, in particular if you found A Song for Arbonne ""gripping"", then you may like this one. Otherwise, find something else."
2,Long Time Kay Fan Disappointed,"I anticipated this book eagerly - what a HUGE disappointment!Seems like negative side-effects of too much Harry Potter in the marketplace - Kay never wrote like Rowling - and he doesn't now either.This book misses out on much of the vivd imagery and sensual and relationship insight and intensity of his other books.Its like someone tried to make it more G rated fora wider audience - and killed much of the soul and poetry that his other books share,If your a fan of Kay's work, do yourself a favor, and skip this one - re-read Tigana or Arbonne instead,"
5,One of Kay's best.,"Being a Kay fan, I started this book several years ago. After 30 pages or so I gave up with the sense that this one didn't quite do it. A month ago I started the book anew. I forged through the thirty pages, slowly this time attempting to keep track of all the characters. By books end I was reading as slowly as possible for I didn't want it to end! What a book! Highly recommend to readers who will follow the complex development of the story."
2,Cowboy Baby (book & DVD),"The size of this book is huge, by children's books standards. Would qualify as a ""floor book"" as it is too big to hold comfortably. We have a copy of this book about 8-10 yrs old that is a nice size for lap reading. I purchased this copy of the book recently for a friend who just had a baby, and was disappointed at the big size. I did not see any specifications on the order page-----if they were there I did not see them. It has a nice story and I remember how much I loved reading it to my child who was snuggled in my lap. Also, our book did not come with a DVD, and I can't imagine it would need one, when it is so important to be close to your child while reading the book to them. The DVD is just one more ""screen time"" thing to avoid."
5,We love Cowboy baby,I stumbled upon this book by chance. After the first read ~(with attempted Texan accent) I read this book every night for 6 weeks. A wonderful book which captivated my girls like no other.
4,"Bedtime at the ""Bay-B Corral""!","My kids fell hard for this cowboy baby and his adventures with his pals Texas Ted and Denver Dog, even though they're probably -- at 5 and 6 -- officially ""too old"" for it.Sure, it's hokey. Sure, it's a British writer's caricature of what life in the West must be like. But the illustrations are so irresistably cheerful, and the story so beguilingly cute that this is definitely one worth lassoing for your own little cowpokes."
3,ok but has MSG,"The nuts are pretty good and i like the little containers they come in. but was looking for some salted peanuts without MSG. which alas these have. they didn't have the ingredient list on this page or where i could search for it on the web so i bought them based on the fact that they were descibed at 100% all natural. I guess MSG is dervived from a natural subsatnace but it does not always sit will with me, so i won't be buy these again."
3,Not as good as the other popular brand.,I buy a lot of these Emerald nuts here and this dry roasted is the least favorite. They just don't taste as good as the popular peanut guy ones. I've loved all the other Emerald nuts but if you want great dry roasted these are probably not what you want to buy a bunch of.
1,Allergic to soy,Why do you add SOY to dry roasted Peanuts? It put me in breathing shock when I tried them before I read the ingredients. It is hard to find food I can eat and I am so disapointed that I can not eat your Peanuts. Julanne Howard
3,The magic is depleting..,"I love The Dickies so much, and own all of their albums. I must say though this one is my least favorite. Out of the 14 songs, I like about seven. That's not bad, but in my opinion the Dickies should of made this album better, espcially for the amount of time they worked on it. The album is okay - very average when compared to The Dickies. Nothing special in the Dickies collection."
5,Pop in Punks Clothing,"Just goes to show the other 'new' popular punk bands what its all about!After a week or so of aural attention I can't get this out of my head. First play through See My Way was my stand out track (yes a cover but no-one has ever done a cover like The Dickies)now its every track I couldn't pick a favourite if I tried. Yes we have heard Nobody But Me and My Pop The Cop before but hey vinyl gets worn out so I'm not too bothered by that.Older folks remember The Dickies by this album I promise you won't be disappointed.Younger guys and girls buy it! You like Green Day? The Offspring? how can you not like 'em.Stan Lee's solos are kept to the essentials as always its what makes him the guitar god he is right Noodles?LGP voice is as only he can sing them and not forgetting the rest of the guys.Stand out album, stand out band, see them live but PLEASE I'm begging now don't keep us waiting another 5 years for the new stuff"
4,Zoot me up!,"I bought this album for the Larry Clinton track ""Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"" and rapidly found the Fats Waller ""Swingin' them Christmas Bells"" and the Freddie Martin version of ""Sleigh Ride"". Some of the tunes are the ones you hear over and over, like Guy Lombardo and Spike Jones, but others are just unknown to those of us born after 1960, and that's a shame, because there is some great music on this album!"
2,Not that swinging!,"The Cd offers some nice melodies and some that will make you move , but the monologes that begin some songs will make you want to scream especially the little boy talking about losing his two front teeth. I buy Christmas CDs for party music. This one will make your guests want to leave. If you are going to record and edit out a few losers then you will like it! Flanneldaddy"
4,Good Vintage Big Band Christmas Music,The music is great! A nice holiday collection from the bid band era worth buying.
4,Stark but elegant,"Having purchased these stands sight unseen, I must say I was very impressed with the quality of the product and their appearance. The paint is a black matte that is hard to describe but a wonder to behold. The entire assembly is stout and of readily apparent quality. I do wish the speaker wire guide was something more than a plastic appendage through which the wire passes, but it does the job relatively well. I am very happy with the purchase. It definitely improves the look of my Wharfedale Diamond 9.1s."
5,VERY ESSENTIAL NESMITH ALBUM,"This is Nesmith's best studio album since RANCH STASH. Recorded in 1979, the album has a different rocker feel and one wonders if this was his swan song to audio albums at the time and letting it all hang out. Al Perkins helps on electric guitar ashe did on the excellent LIVE AT PALAIS recorded in 1978. CRUISIN has to be the best song here with FLYING, CARIOCA, LIGHT AND CAPSULE also being excellent efforts. As good as it is this album ranks behind: HITS KEEP ON COMING, TANTAMOUNT TO TREASON, MAGNETIC SOUTH, NEVADA FIGHTER, LOOSE SALUTE, LIVE AT PALAIS and maybe RANCH STASH in this order."
5,From platter to plastic....,I am in the process of obtaining the CD version of all the platters/vinyl I love to hear. The prices and quality are fantastic.
5,Come Sign with Us: Sign Language Activities for Children,"As a new teacher I find this book to a wonderful inspiartion to teach out of the box. I want to teach Spanish and A.S.L. but wasn't sure how. When I saw this book, it got me even more excited about teaching than I already was. I immediately came up with ideas to intergrate Spanish, A.S.L., and everyday speaking. It may seem silly to some because it was so simple, but the idea to tech them together had not come to me in such a complete form until I saw this book. these are ideas that can be adapted to any topic and cirriculum. Great for new teacher and the veteran trying somthing new or expanded."
1,Item is NOT the movie!,I thought this was the movie with Humphrey Bogart - It's not. It is a scan of the printed book by Dashiell Hammett on a DVD so you can read it on your TV screen. (Why you would want to do this I can't imagine.) It does not say this anywhere on the packaging or in the ad on Amazon.
1,Bon Jovi: Round and Round,Not worth the money. This is an unarthorized DVD that contains interviews of people who were around when the band was first getting started. No real band exposure.
4,Hard to Find Items,"These reusable ice packs are hard to find, my kid loves them went she is in pain; very easy for her to hold them."
4,Worthwhile film,"This film merely scratches the surface of the material in ""The Ramayana.""Nevertheless, this is a film that is worthwhile seeing. If you had never heard of""The Ramayana"" before, this film is a good introduction."
2,Acorn is poor at being a Good Neighbor,"I just purchased the DVD version of the Final Episode and the Royal Command Performance. After watching just the first disk, I am disappointed. This product has not been video remastered and some scenes are very hard to watch indeed. They seem to shimmer a slightly out of focus haze that is distracting and not the quality that we expect of a DVD. In this regard AcornMedia has cheated us and I probably will not buy the rest of the series on DVD.Otherwise I agree with all of the other comments. Good Neighbors is an excellent show and a wonderful laugh."
5,Sad to say this is the last... It was so wonderful!,"I saw this series when it came to US TV some years ago (thank you, forever, PBS). I loved it then. I love it now. I've got the whole collection, finally.Stars: Tom & Barbara Good, played by Richard Briers and Felicity Kendal - whom I worship, and Margo & Jerry Leadbetter, played by Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington.I also saw Felicity Kendal in a PBS replay of the BBC Shakespeare series with her starring as Viola in ""Twelfth Night"" and was so impressed that I named a daughter after her.Felicity (and the other cast members) are believable, funny, and always in trouble, love, etc., with each other.The setting... Tom & Barbara move to a ritzy neighborhood and start a farm... well, more like they decide to ""live off the land."" Try that in a swank neighborhood and I'm sure you'll end up with some of the problems they had.Totally hysterical. Very funny. A must see. Own it if you can. Definitely for the whole family."
5,Sad this was the Final Season,We have enjoyed numerous chuckles and great laughs over this wonderful season of Good Neighbors. I am only sorry this was the final season of this great series.
3,Quality Show but Film quality isn't the best,"I grew up watching these on PBS. This show was one of the first things my parents recorded on their VCR twenty-five years ago. Our family loves the comedy. Many lines, eg ""Dear sir, thank you for your splendid empty box . . . "", have become part of our dialogue. I would recommend this series to anyone--just not this particular release. The film quality is not up to par with what you would see on TV. There has been a never release by the BBC which has much better quality. If you are looking to add this show to your collection, try the newer release."
4,Really Good Book,I enjoyed the book very much. I t was insightful and for the most part very accuate.
4,Lots of fun,"This is a very fun book to flip through. It is based on astrology, so of course not everything will be true. However, I did find a number of things I could relate to, and the description of my sign was mostly right on."
1,Uhhhhh,"I didn't expect the book to be as crude as it was. Yes it is about sex but there is a way to talk about it without needing a disclaimer. Not only that I didn't really find it accuate. I think the book might sell because it is about sex but there are books that are far better, more sensually descriptive and worth my money. I did not like the way he talked about my sign. Five mintues into the book I new a man had to write this book (get away from the sterotypes man)."
1,Not worth it,Book really does not offer any special as far as idea or self options. Just about a boring a reading the horoscope out of your local paper everyday.
3,Not the right size but does what it promises,I bought these for my dining room chairs since the provided stops seem to stick in our apartments vinyl flooring. Unfortunately these don't fit correctly so they don't stay on the bottom or chair if they're lifted up but if we can keep them level they do what they promise.
1,A GIFT FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION,I PURCHASED THIS GIFT A FEW WEEKS AGO. I GAVE THIS GIFT TO MY NEPHEW. I ENJOY SEEING HIM PLAY THE GAMES ON THE PLUG & PLAY UNIT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND SERVICE.
5,This ends all metalcore,"As Blood Runs Black is the band to know if you are into melodic and brutal metalcore in 2006. Every single song on this freaking cd destroys.. from the INSANELY fast blast/gravity beats to the bone crunching death of the breakdowns this cd pleases in every way. Every member of the band holds his weight musically. Ernie's guitar riffs are truly a lesson in stamina, Lech plays some of the cleanest/fastest beats to be found on nearly any modern metalcore record, Nick gives the low end of the album that much desired kick and he does it tactfully using sweeps an the like, and finally Chris has got to be one of the most versatile vocalists out there. From the lowest of growls to the highest of highs, you will want to scream your lungs out and chant along with the lyrics. Please pick this cd up, you WILL NOT regret it."
4,nice and angry :),"Very good album all around. Has everything I like: speed, good musicians, good musical score and anger. It's definately worth the buy!"
1,"It was better when it was called ""At the Gates""","What do we have here? Yet another ""deathcore"" band that steals riffs from At the Gates, adds blastbeats, and places ""breakdowns"" in the music. Are people getting tired of this genre yet? My advice is to listen to the Scandinavian Melodic Death Metal bands they are mimicking, and leave this unoriginal tripe to 15 year old scene kids.It also saddens me to hear people are referring to this band as technical. Most of these riffs aren't hard to play if you know how to hammer on and pull off, and were in essence done over a decade ago by bands like At the Gates and Dark Tranquillity. If you want to hear some death metal that truly is complex, melodic, and intelligent, stick with Nile, Decapitated, Behemoth or Necrophagist.I'm not denying this band has talent. They are just severely lacking in originality.EDIT: I should add that this review is not meant to bash ALL deathcore. Some bands, like All Shall Perish and The Red Chord are actually pretty original."
5,Encore!!!! This is EBM at it's finest!!!,"Everything in this album is sooo original and powerful. From start to finish you will be amazed. Shari Valenta has some of the most exotic/ethereal voices this side of the industrial world. Combined with a track pairing up Scary Valentine and one of my favorite bands, Pure Drama, this CD is worth every penny spent. Watch for the next release by the man behind it all, Scot Gordon - HERMIT BASTARD. Encore!!!"
3,"flojo, flojo, que decepción!","primero quiero que sepan que yo soy un gran admirador de Djavan.no les voy a decir que este disco es malo, pero sí que el tipo anda sin inspiración.el disco repite todo lo que el tipo hizo.yo soy musico y les digo que cayó enormemente la calidad de compositor.si quieren el buen Djavan, escuchen ""a voz e o violao"", ""luz"", ""seduzir"", ""lilás"""
3,Cool Book,"I will be honest, I didn't want to read this book. But after I was done, I felt I had really learned something."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic music. If you're a Kottke fan, you won't be disappointed. Oh yea, Mike Gordon was great too."
2,Quirky in a not-so-great way,"My guess is that neither Leo Kottke nor Mike Gordon would brag about their vocal prowess, so why would they both stress vocals over instrumentation on this short (42 minute) collaborative CD? Some of the songs are whimsical and harmless, but both these performers have recorded some truly marvelous performances in the past. I was hoping that the sum of the two parts would be greater than this.After Kottke's recent ""A Shout Towards Noon,"" I was expecting more of his technical mastery with Mike Gordon providing support. But it is only on Kottke's compositions here and on the collaborative track ""June"" that one will find anything approaching the classic Kottke six and 12-string styles. Gordon's solo compositions seem repetitive and shallow, including the title track.This is a pairing that has lots of potential, but they didn't reach it on this effort."
3,Not bad,It sounds like Mike Gordon approached the bass parts more like a horn player than a bass player and that works great. The only downside is Leo's voice. He still sounds like a hillbilly.
2,Oh the humanity,"The instrumentals are good, but the vocals are dreadful! They sound like The Grateful Dead practicing Gilbert and Sullivan in a decompression chamber. And I really like Kottke. Have everything he ever produced."
2,Smells Phishy,"I bought this CD based on some reviews I read, I really wanted something by Leo, and the fact that it's HDCD decoded. I've only listened to it a few times. But I'm pretty disappointed by what I've heard. I'm not sure I can get myself to listen to it anymore. I will echo another comment that much of it is just too Phishy. Just really silly stuff, and not silly in a good way."
2,Clone Go Home!,"Let me preface my remarks with I am 58 years old (a year older than Leo Kottke) and have been listening to Kottke for 30 years.I just received ""Clone"" from amazon.com a few days ago. I'm really disappointed. I can't give it but 2 stars since there's no way to give 2-1/2 that I can see. There are far too many vocals: eight of fourteen cuts are vocals. Seven of the eight are either inane or insane! Neither Kottke nor Gordon can sing worth a damn. I have always thought that Leo's self-description of his voice as sounding ""...like geese farts on a muggy day..."" was actually quite charitable. The six instrumentals range from mediocre to pretty good, though nothing earth-shaking. I hear bits and pieces of older stuff. I liked the album photos. For one thing, they show Leo as starting to show his age rather than a perpetual 28-year-old. Maybe having his birthday on September 11th might have something to do with this. I wish Leo would just Shut Up And Play!"
2,Stop with the vocals,"Good instrumentals, but the vocals are dreadful. Sounds like Grateful Dead practicing Gilbert and Sullivan in a decompression chamber. Personally, I enjoy goose farts on a muggy day. Next time, keep Gordon on bass, lose the singing."
2,To all Leo fans,I have been listening to Leo for many many years now. I was a little disappointed in this album. A few songs were pointless none sense that Phish would have tried to pull. I understand the new generation really loved Phish. For me I was glad to see them break. Mike Gordon is a great bassist but should never be allowed to write or sing. Save your money unless you are really curious as I was.
1,What a Turkey!!!,Horrible little book I bought in despertaion at some airport. Please save yourself the money of buying this. Just a run of the mill travel book with vague attempts at humour but more often just boring.
5,poehler bear,"This video is extremely hilarious, although I wish it was longer. Amy is the best impersonator and can play any character. SNL just isn't the same without her. She's my idol!"
3,Good up to 60 psi or so but bad for 90-100 psi,"3 Stars because my application required reaching 100 psi which this pump claims to be able to do. After using the pump a few time the frame bagan to bend at both ends of the barrels (pistons) and then it would no longer reach 100 psi and would barely make 90 psi. I'm returning this pump for a refund. It's also not the pump pictured in the photo. It is realitively easy however to operate for lower pressures (up to 60 psi maybe) and it does inflate quickly up to 60 psi so if that's all you need, then this pump would be good for infrequent to moderate use up to 60 psi or so. Beyond that you might want to consider a good ($35-80) floor pump. I ended up buying a Blackburn Air Tower 4 at it'll pump up to 100 psi no sweat and to 160 psi with a reasonable amount of effort. Hope this information is helpful."
1,Avoid me period !,"This gauge gave me the wrong PSI, 50PSI vs 35PSi, very inaccurate, cheap build quality, it was aleady near broke after several use."
1,Doesn't pressurize beyond 50 psi,"I used it only once and returned it. As other reviewers have pointed out, it doesn't pressurize bike tires beyond 50 psi and the gauge shows wrong pressure. Also, the pedal bent only after 15 or 20 pushes. I do not recommend it."
4,Learning German,"As others have noted, this book looks a little bit dated; the illustrations seem to have come from a by gone era. There have also been some changes in German society that are not reflected in the book, which would make the learner sound a bit old fashioned.However, there are some very good examples of simple phrases and sentences, with explanations of structure and grammar. With the additional words, it would be possible to quickly put together some fairly good conversation pieces.The guide to pronunciation is not always entirely clear; some others do a much better job. However, no book is going to prepare you for the reality of conversational German; but this will help get you started.This is not really for someone that has more than a basic grasp of the language, although it might be useful to help brush up if you haven't used the language for many years. It would however, be good for someone starting to learn, particularly as part of a structured plan."
2,Kindle version,"Great book - old fashioned, out of date, but useful in many ways. As pointed out by other reviewers, the kindle version is just scanned in pages, and therefore hard to read due to small print. But if you have really good eyes, it's ok."
1,Terrible Kindle Edition. Don't buy it.,"I bought the Kindle edition of this book. Strongly recommend everyone not to buy kindle edition. Because I found that it is actually 100M file filled with scanned pages. It is already frustrating to wait several HOURS to download such a large file into kindle or ipad. It is even more torturing to read the small text, even much finer that those liability exemption clauses on carpark ticket's back. The text is practically unreadable at all, as they are images, not text enlargeable in Kindle.I felt being cheated. Amazon should have banned publisher from selling this unreadable format for books in kindle edition. Now I have to repurchase its paper edition again."
5,Das Buch ist wunderbar!,"BUY THIS BOOK BECAUSE:!) IT IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND2) THERE ARE PLENTY OF PICTURES FOR THE ADD & ADHD PEOPLE!3) IT IS JUST PERFECT FOR A BEGINNER4) BECAUSE SPEAKING GERMAN IS SEXY5) THIS BOOK IS THE BEST ONE I HAVE SEEN6) YOU MUST SPEEK GERMAN TO GO TO GERMANY!ANYWAYS, REALLY, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, JUST BUY THE BOOK UNLESS YOU ARE LATE PAYING YOUR ELECTRIC BILL :)"
1,"Full page image scans, not text with embedded pictures","I happen to own the paperback book, and was looking for a Kindle version for my 2nd Gen Kindle.If you Sample the book, you will see that each page is just a scanned image. The paperback has about 7"" of text vertically, and it looks like the full-page image is just squished onto the smaller-sized screen of the Kindle.That means tiny, tiny text, even if you select the image for zooming. I have excellent eyesight, but I find it unusable. Also means no selecting text, no resizing text, no notes, no look-up (if you set a German dictionary as your default lookup, say).The tiny size might be tolerable on a DX, otherwise, be prepared to SQUINT!"
3,"Lucy, I'm home!","This is indeed a reasonably thorough and logical presentation of basic German. But there are a couple of negatives.First, the print is very small, and the font is not clean, nor does it contrast well with the paper. A superb reading light and perfect close vision are required. And even then, it's exhausting after an hour or so.Second, the vignettes and examples (even the drawings) are weirdly, annoyingly dated. This is apparently simply a reprint of something written in the late 1940s or early '50s.One example: Even now, Germans smoke more than Americans or Canadians. But this book seems almost obsessed with tobacco and smoking. Very 1950s mindset.This is a substantial and serious book, and certainly worth the money. And it is simply a must for the heavy smoker who wants to learn German as it was spoken when I Love Lucy was a hot new show. :)"
3,Great German Learning Book,It is better when you combine it with a few other books to learn German with. It doesn't give you everything you need to learn it but it helps you figure it out eventually. It just needs the help of other books for you to fully understand the language.
2,How to speak and write German,"I found it a little hard to grasp the different sounds,it has a lot of good grammer lessons.Instant Immersionwas a better buy for me."
3,Not up to date... but OK,"Price/performance is OK, but the content is outdated.I would recommend to spend a few dollars more if you are seriously interested in learning German.For example:Teach Yourself German (Teach Yourself Complete Courses)"
1,Not Good,"I thought it was completely not good, and think that for me, personally, this method of learning is unhelpful and counterproductive. As an ESL teacher, I would not teach english in this way. It is a confused, unorganized barrage of unnecessary (for beginner speakers) vocabulary from the beginning. The core vocabulary that should be taught at the start is not included until later, and even then isn't well organized."
1,superlative book. pathetic e-edition for my kindle and tablet-- fail,"I can't over emphasize what a great book this is. I have a paper copy but wanted to add a digital copy for ease of use. Simply, the e-book does not open as the sort of e-text I'm used to. It's as though each page were scanned seperately as an image but not OCR'ed into text. I could do that myself and get a better result. The lower quarter of the page does not show and it is impossible to resize. Even if it were possible to resize, as displayed, the text is too small to read. It is equally unusable on my android tablet. Not only am I sorry I bought the thing, I'm afraid to buy anything else from Kindle. I do not have money to throw away on unusuable junk. If this had been my first Kindle experience, it would have been my last."
1,Can't read on the Kindle Fire,"I have the paper version, and think it's excellent. Wanted to get the Kindle version so I could carry it around with me. I can't read the pages though!! Way too small. Will probably remove it, since there's no use in it being on the Kindle. Very disappointed, because it's a very well written (though yes, I know a lot of the phrasing etc. is dated) and a very sound book in paper format."
2,Awful.,Not only is the book poorly organized the sections seem to drone on needlessly and repetitively. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of the table of cases and just read the opinions online.
4,Score hundreds of goals with this funny game,"Ok this is not Winning Eleven but if you want real soccer go and play WE otherwise if you like to score many goals and just have fun attacking over and over again go for this game, or if you had play WE franchise too much , try this one, a fast and easy gameplay makes it very funny and also you have ALL the leagues available and classic teams with original games.A great buy"
3,Glen Campbell's revelatory life as upcoming famous Singer.,"HHHMMMM,I had read another Auto-Bio of Glen's @ local library....It was very revealing of Glen's battle(s) w / alcohol and cocaine. And, the user-type personalities who(m) TOOK ADVANTAGE of poor Glen's rise to Super Singer Stardom. My-oh-my, he sure had a meteoric ""hell-fire"" passion for Music to have endured ! This book / novel size auto-Bio is akin to a shorter synopsis of similar candid sharing of Glen's life in the more in depth Libray book. I sincerely wonder....Is he still alcoholic...and / or on drugs ??? He claims to be Born Again in Christ Jesus.....wasn't he photographed a few yrs. ago....having been stopped by Police for...drinking...or ? In PHX, AZ...or ? BUT, Dear Ones, Who(m) are we to judge our Dear Brother Glen....are...we...PERFECT ?! HHHMMMM....Come on now, are we ???!!!"
5,Good Quality Tool'z,"Very Good Quality Tool, will be buying more of the same type of wrench in different size'z, have not had another gear strip out on me since i bought this tool, i race RC Monster Truck'z !!!"
5,Soooooo much better than those awkward L shaped allen keys!,"I just got a pair of these to work on my BlueRay 450 and EXI 450 RC helicopters. The 1.5mm tips are very precise and made of hard metal that won't likely round off. I could tell the difference the first time I used them. They bite into the screw head so much more securely, and probably won't strip all but the most stubbornly seized up allen head screw. The grips are just the right size to provide good torque. It's so much easier dismantling the feathering shaft on the main rotor heads of my helicopters with these. Can't believe I made do for so long without them! I was considering buying a pair of MIP Thorp drivers, but got two of these for less than the price of one MIP. Love these so much I'll probably get a whole set in metric and standard."
5,Robeez are the best!,"I never thought I'd be a Robeez fan, to me they are just to pricey. So I bought a couple pairs gently used off of Ebay, and I was just blown away! Even after another child used them, I washed them and she wears them all the time and they're still in excellent shape!! I just bought my 5th pair of Robeez, and I don't mind paying full price - they're worth it!"
5,Great single,This single is great. I originally purchased it after trainspotting it in one of Danny Tenaglia's sets at Vinyl NYC. It's great to have for your house music collection!
1,Not your typical Photek...,"Although Photek is an excellent drumnbass dj/producer, this album (or track and remixes) is, in my opinion, terrible. If you're looking for good drumnbass, don't buy this CD! This CD is nothing like Photek's Modus Operandi, (which, in my opinion, is his greatest album). Instead, the songs here are slow, unlively, and annoying. They reflect poorly on the talent Photek really possesses. If you're still curious, however, download the track online to see what I'm talking about. Remember, this is just my opinion; you might like the CD."
4,Great book for first time builders,"I am getting ready to build a Cobra replica and I found this book very useful. Although this will be my first kit car, I have restored about a half dozen cars from jeeps to mustangs to impalas. Really good advice for beginners"
4,Great book for one who is building a car from the ground up.,It is a very good book for someone who is interested in building a car from the chassis up. It gives a good techniques on suspension and brakes. It also gives points on some mistakes others have made and trys to steer you clear of them. I have built several kit cars and this time I am building the frame and suspension. The book does not add too much help for one who is just putting a fiberglas body on a donor car. The instruction manual from the manufacturer would be much more valuable.
1,Useless to anyone with the slightest automotive experience.,"This book is beyond bland. It contains no information useful to anyone who has the slightest experience with automotive mechanics. It is typical of so many automotive books, and especially magazines, which contain only the most basic and generic information rather than addressing the difficult technical aspects of the subject. Any one who could find the information in this book useful and informative should NOT be attempting to build a kit car. My qualifications? I own a Lamborghini Countach kit car built on a stretched Fiero. I bought it partially assembled and finished it (if a project like this is ever finished!) last fall. It is registered, state inspected, and on the road."
1,Too expensive,"Read the product information carefully. It shows 3 lily pads, but you only get one. Plus you can't even pick any of the colors. You just get what they send you. Too expensive for one just one lily pad."
1,Don't waste your time...,"This is a ridiculous and manic amalgam of nonsense that fails to satisfy either a lust for Daniel Craig (the hook that made me purchase it) or an interest in Francis Bacon. You will not learn about the artist and you won't see much of Daniel Craig (yes, he's naked in the tub, but is that alone worth the purchase price?). What's more, you won't likely be engaged as there is nothing even closely resembling a story arc. Perhaps the film-makers forgot to take there ritalin during production?! Too frenetic, too disjointed, and just...too much of nothing to connect with."
3,Francis Bacon,"We are talking about the Sixties artist here not the Sir Guy. Reallydidn't see too much in this gay film that features Daniel Craig. I seethis as an improtant addition to any Daniel Craig collections, though."
4,Love is the Devil,"I was very satisfied with this movie. The discription was accurate and the transaction was pleasant. All in all, a very good experience."
4,Excellent Bio,A captivating look a the tortured soul of an artist. Jacobi as usual was wonderful. Daniel Craig is poised to become one of the more important actors in cinema today. His range is astounding.
4,The Heat is On,"Intriguing, indepth study of a twisted mind, and preJames Bond for Danial Craig, in an unusual portrayal as a lover,with Derek Jacobi at his best. The English art world shows itself in a secret background to its artistic life. Makes for adventure, surprise and imagination."
5,A classic piece of work!,This is a classic work regarding the Huichol (Wizarika) people. The authors are leading experts in West Mexican pre-hispanic studies.
4,Very easy to install on 95 YJ.,"Sounds good, looks good, could have been a little cheaper. I didn't notice a significant difference but I already have every mod on the little 2.5 except a header. I mean it's aesthetically pleasing but it's not going to outrun a corvette with it."
4,Just Plain Fun,"What a fun & educational collection of songs. The music is high quaility, and very professional. The children I know who have heard the songs really enjoy them. They were singing along to song in no time. What a great way to learn math and other facts."
1,Just Plain Weird,"I just purchased this cd for my son. I was assuming it would be cute little songs to help him memorize his addition facts. Well, this cd has songs but they are mixed with this freaky story telling bits that are just plain weird. We got through the first several songs/stories before turning it off because the narrator/singer's voice (who sounded like he had smoked 5 packs of cigarrettes his entire life) on Stella's rag, actually scared my son and he hasn't wanted to listen to it since."
4,Hopeful,"I used these last month and it seemed to work as it detected LH surge (test line as dark, or even darken then control line)CD17, (started testing CD 10) so i figured i ovulated day 18th, anyways 12.5 days later on CD 30 at night :( AF arrived. But am still optimistic and trusting G-D that he knows what's best for me and hopefully he in his goodness will bless us this month G-D Willing with our most desired wish. Am continuing to use this but also bought another brand this month - clear blue easy digital to crosscheck making sure these work. I am praying for all of us TTC and am sure that G-d will bless us all verrrry soon. AMEN! :)"
5,WORKED!!!!!,"I thought I left a review on this already but ok, i will do it again... This cheapos really work!!! Its easy to use and and it works... 2 lines showed on CD17 and CD18 and then I stopped using it. I still have alot left and hopefully I wont use it again, coz i just want to get preggy this time.....Baby dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Mixed Results,"I used these for four months and would not recommend them because of my mixed experience. The first two months, the ovulation predictor was positive at the right time and only once, so it seemed they were working. When the ovulation test was not positive at all the next two months, I began to get worried that I wasn't ovulating. Later when my period was late, I used the pregnancy tests. After about three which I thought were negative, I looked closer and noticed there was a faint positive line. I got a First Response pregnancy test 3 pack and took those (of course all three!), and all were positive. So I got pregnant when I was starting to worry I had ovulation problems! Even though they are cheap and the company's service is great, these are of little value if you can't rely on the results."
1,Ordered in October..... obviously these tests are time sensitive,"Starting a new cycle--- obviously these strips are important for that. Ordered in October, STILL haven't received them and it's almost mid November--- unprofessional."
1,Disappointed,"Don't waste your money!I was so excited to start testing. BUT I never got a + OPK. I was using them 2-3 times a day, because I so wanted to see a dark line. Luckily I keep track other ways too. I will come back in a few weeks to report on the HPTs."
2,not good service,"I've got the products for more than a week, and am still waiting for the instructions. without instructions, those items are totally no use."
4,Great product,"I have used several tests already and find them very easy to use. I am so happy they are so inexpensive so, I am free to test as frequent as neccessary. I found that I had two lines everytime I tested with the LH tests, one line was very faint and did get darker as ovulation was near. Thanks for a great, inexpensive product."
4,What has two thumbs and is pregnant?,"This girl!Glory be for OPKs! I had no issues using this product and it helped me time everything and now we're expecting. Wahooo! Instructions were included and I had no issues following them. Grab yourself some Dixie paper cups and get to testing.... I actually discovered I was ovulating earlier than expected and so we got our timing right and got our BFP this month. Also, I got a positive (albeit SUPER faint) positive test 8 dpo. I was just testing because I couldn't help myself and these were so cheap I figured why not? I really didn't think it'd show positive that early but here we are :) I got a nice, dark no-question-about-it positive at 12 days past ovulation."
2,Not a good product,"The ovulation tests are not good. It's not the Wondfo brand. The result is not clear. I test it the day after my ovulation day, it will show a faint line in the first 2 minutes, then it turns darker after 2 minutes, and a little later, it turns as dark as the control line. At the same time, I use the brand that I got from earlypregnancytest.com, it shows a faint line and after 5 minute, the line color still maintains the same; which shows that I have ovulated."
4,"Very good value for money, mostly accurate results",Pros: Mostly accurate resultsQuantity you get for the price allows trail and errorCons: Pee in a cup (which is not too bad after you get used to)Strip itself is small and the dipping and reading areas are smallI would recommend these to someone looking to get pregnant and need a ovulation and pregnancy kit for trail and error. You will get used to them for a few try's. Very affordable and mostly reliable.
4,Very simple & Effective,I found this product very simple to use and very effective. Results came out in less than 2mins and are very sharp. Hence there was no more for any kind of confusion. These strips have helped me effectively track my ovulation dates. I like it very much !!
4,We'll see.,"I thought I would try these. They are much cheaper than the big name brands. I have been using them for one month. The instructions are on the packaging and pretty straight forward. When I first started using them (op strips), I really thought they weren't working because I would see a faint line all the time. I became really discouraged until one day, the line was exactly the same shade as the control line. So, my advice is to just keep taking the tests and disregard any line that isn't DARK. I'm going to use them again next month, so like I said, we'll see:) I also used the pregnancy strips once and they worked the same way. The line is either there or it isn't. These tests are extremely straight forward.... no frills."
4,"Smart, cost-effective purchase","I am sure this is the same ""technology"" as most pregnancy tests, just not in special packaging and enclosed in plastic. If you are needing some help conceiving, buy this and save yourself a lot of money."
4,Great deal for a good product!,"So anyone who has used ovulation tests knows how pricy they can be. The savings from the 10 pregnancy tests alone pays for whole item! I recommend doing a little research and learning how and when to use these. They are cheap enough, I recommend doing 2 a day. I am doing one 2-4pm and one 6-8pm."
3,NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THE OVULATION TEST,I am not too sure about these. I CANT get a positive. They said that the test line has to be as dark or darker than the control line. All I get is a test line that is lighter than the control line. I have tested every day for the last 60 days at different times of the day and I can't get a positive. My cycles are ALWAYS on time to the minute so I dont know whats going on.I never received instructions but looked at other womens reviews to figure out how they work.Any suggestions ladies?
2,It is not an accurate tool and doesn't work,"It is not an accurate kit and doesn't work when it is time to work. But the kit from another manufacturer worked for me when I checked the same day with two kits. I would not recommend this to anyone. I would have bought accuclear or clear blue kits. As it is combo pack, I purchased it but no use."
4,Simple enough,"This is simple enough to use. I read most other comments and the instructions and found it pretty basic and straightforward. I'm on my second cycle, and even thou I'm not pregnant yet (waiting one more week to see if I am), I have no complaints about the strips. The second line is faint until you get a positive result. For me, when positive, both lines were relatively dark and the same color. I can't wait to get a positive result from the pregnancy test!"
3,"worked, but tricky","As some other reviewers have stated, these are not the easiest test strips to use, and the results are not as clear as you'd like to see. I don't think I ever got a pink line that was exactly as dark as the control line; mostly I got faint lines for several days. I did always get the control line. What confused me for the first few months is that there is no clear 'ramping up' of the darkness of the lines. For example, I might get faint pink lines for 4 days, then suddenly I would get a much darker line the next day, and only for a very brief period of time-- if I hadn't tested at exactly the right time on the right day, I would have missed it all together. In fact, I'm positive this is what happened for the first few months.Did it work? Yes, it did-- I'm currently about 10 weeks pregnant. But it took several tries to figure out the variables and I missed the ovulation window more than once."
4,Cost Efficient,This is a great deal for someone who is TTC. The drugstore price to buy a large quantity of ovulation and pregnancy test strips far outweighs the price for this package. This is a great savings for pregnancy planning especially over an extended period of time. The tests also seem to be fairly accurrate ( I compared to data on a fertility monitoring website and the tests results were consistent with other fertility signs as far as discerning ovulation and pregnancy)
4,Good for price.,"Helped me get pregnant, so can't complain. The indicator line was hard to tell when I ovulated though, when compared to other brands of these that I had used in the past."
1,Didn't work for me,"I used these religiously when TTC and the test line was never as dark as the base line. I thought I wasn't ovulating. It would get darker as the days went on, but never matched the base line. According to the directions, that's a negative. A friend of mine was seeing a fertility specialist and said he told her to use the Clearblue tests as they are by far better. They are not cheap, but I tried it for a month and I did get a smiley face, which is a positive result. I then took these again to see if I would get a positive and I still did not. I luckily was able to conceive that month that I got the smiley face with the Clearblue test. These seem to work for a lot of people, but they were not accurate for me."
4,Great Buy,Came nicely put together in a ziploc bag and they are easy to manage. Same quality as store bought. Save money and buy these - you'll be happier in the long run.
5,AMAZING!!!,"Work Great!!!Received these items Very Quickly!!!Very Reliable. Easy to Use and Read!This is our 1st Month TTC, wish us Lots of Luck, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND these to anyone trying to Conceive!!!"
1,Used for 3 mos w/o a positive test,"Let me say that I didn't really have super high expectations for this product just because of the price-apparently you really do get what you pay for. But I figured, what the heck, let's give it a try. I conceived my first 2 children quite quickly and without any trouble so I thought, to boost my odds, I would try an OPK. After 3 months of use, I have never received a positive test. The first month I was using a copper IUD, but that really has no effect on ovulation. The past two months-nothing. I have been using an ovulation calculator and keeping a journal of my cycles so hopefully we will conceive soon, even without the strips. If not, I will be buying a more reputable brand."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!,"Let me start by saying that I have never had an issue with the OPK's. I love them and have never tried the HPT's until I came across this package deal. The HPT's are JUNK! Mine expire 12/2013 as does a friends who also bought this very pack. Yesterday, between the two of us, we had 6 FALSE POSITIVES!! Now, she and I have been TTC for some time, both having obsticles that make the journey difficult. Imagine our skeptical yet happy reaction to a positive HPT, finally!! Only to have ME wake up to my period this morning, and her testing again with a more RELIABLE brand and get negatives! This is Bull!! I'm very upset and will be making a complaint in all appropriate places. BUYERS BEWARE!!"
1,didn't work for me,"These strips didn't work for me. I went a whole month without detecting a LH surge, and the same thing was happening the next month so I bought a pack of more expensive tests to compare, and the other brand picked up the surge while these strips continually showed nothing. Maybe they just don't work for me."
1,Not impressed,"At first I chalked up the couple of dud tests as ""just happens"". But then I never got a positive OPK. (I have used other brands successfully, but ok, maybe it was ""just me"".) My bigger disappointment came when I flipped through every packet in the envelope to find that there were no pregnancy tests. And yes, I doublechecked and Amazon told me this was the set I purchased. At least it was only $10."
1,"Cheap product, compromised results","I had purchased this product as other reviewers seemed confident in its accuracy. After going through nearly the whole pack of ovulation sticks and still no positive result, I began to doubt the ability of the product to be able to detect LH surge. After doing some research and choosing Clearblue easy Digital Ovulation test strips,Clearblue Easy Digital Ovulation Test, 20 CountI waited this this cycle to try testing again and when the signs seemed to point towards ovulation, I tested both these test strips and the Clearblue easy. Clearblue digital gave me a positive LH surge result and the Devon Medical still said negative. As a side note, the product says that if the result line is faint in comparison to the quality control line, that the result is negative. This product DOES give a faint line when tested at the same time that other tests give a positive, so the product does seem to work, but it isn't perhaps as sensitive as others on the market at detecting LH."
3,Won't work for everyone,"Just wanted to let everyone know, I purchased this product and was under the impression that it was working when the ovulation predictor strips were coming up positive. But them I noticed that they were pretty much positive the whole month. This was because I have PCOS. Beware ladies, if you have a condition like PCOS or if you are taking a medication like Clomid, your LH levels may be consistanly high leading to false results for the ovulation test strips."
1,Negative reading when POSITIVELY PREGNANT,I took the pregnancy tests multiple times because I had a feeling that I was pregnant. Every time the results were negative using these strips. I bought the ClearBlue Easy and guess what...the test came back positive. Soon after getting a positive reading I used one of these strips again and guess what...still negative. My intuition and ClearBlue Easy was right. Sadly these strips are wrong and unreliable.
4,Very nice with hard covers and glossy heavy weight paper,"This book is a reprint of a book first published in 1944 utilizing personnel on active duty to put the book togeather. I do not see where the Publisher can claim Copyright on the contents, because the personnel who worked on the book were paid by the Military. In addition, this Group was not known as "" The Jolly Rogers "" until after July 8, 1943 when Col. Rogers first assumed command, and an enlisted man came up with the designation. The hype about the publicity starting in September 1942 is incorrect and detracts from the real value of the book. In fact, the first combat missions by this group were made in November of 1942. September and October of that year were spent in Hawaii in training and intensive long range patrols, which resulted in no Combat with enemy forces. If those discrepancies were cleared up, then I think any purchasers would indeed be fully satisfied."
3,Just started using this,The book is ok. I do not think the illustrations are as helpful as they could be. They can be hard to make out and when you do see a part in the picture it seems like each time it does not give an adequate explanation of how to replace/work on it.
5,Excellent! Life is stranger than fiction.,"This is a great book that will give you a blood-and-guts, vivid yet funny account of life as an overseas volunteer. The author accurately captures life in isolated, rural Africa. A ""must-read"" for anyone who has been on (or is contemplating) an overseas posting. Looking forward to the sequel."
3,Please cut down on the seasoning!,"Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Walnuts are quite delicious, however the heavy dose of seasoning they contain gets to be a problem, most especially as you get to the bottom of the cannister.These nuts are just so wonderful, I really don't understand the point of dosing them with so much seasoning that can be objectionable to so many people.Would it be possible to pack them without seasoning, but add a ""flavor packet"" inside the cannister for customers to add, only if they wish? I suspect that the company would sell many more canisters if customers could avoid the overwhelming extras!Otherwise, Emerald Nuts are truly a wonderful product!"
3,too much seasoning,"I'd give this 5 stars if they'd leave the seasoning out of the can - I'm not going to eat 4 tablespoons of seasoning! So I don't want to pay for it (you're paying by the ounce) and I certainly don't want to sift through the seasoning to get all the little pieces out of it at the end. Overall - they taste excellent, they are very light & crunch & the seasoning does taste good, if only there wasn't so much of it."
5,Irresistable,"Very good, light and crunchy. I think the package is shelf-stable enough for several months, assuming you can resist eating them."
4,Rawest sex scene ever!,"All in all as a movie production goes, I would give ""Animals"" 2 -3 stars. However, the sex scenes in general were very sensual and the scene in the alley was off the charts! WOW!!! What an awesome, erotic and powerful performance by Nicki Aycox. Where has she been hiding that body?"
2,Urban Romance Novel,"I picked up this movie after finding out it was put out by Maverick Entertainment Group. MEG specialize in independent direct to DVD films and overall their products are worthwhile B-Movies when you buy them used. Animals is no different, it contains gratuitous nudity and is totally an Urban Romance Novel come to life. Overall it wasn't a bad way to spend a late Friday night."
1,Second-rate smut.,"So, I have a thing for Naveen Andrews, and I love monster movies. When I saw this film in a video rental box, I thought I had to see it. Some notes about the cover: I never saw a hot red-head in the movie, and the scene on the cover has nothing to do with anything. That's fine: it reminds me of Evil Dead's cover. This, however, is no Evil Dead. I love a good B-movie as much as the next gal, but this film was riding that line where it was neither good enough nor bad enough to be worth watching. It reeks of mediocrity, and the ""plot"" just seems to be some pointless and badly acted conversations or killings interspersed with the very awkward and unconvincing sex. Suspension-of-disbelief was not invoked. I would only watch it again to hear Andrews say the word ""Darling."""
2,Not much exciting,"Only Aunque Tu Mami No Quiera by Sierra Meastra was something exciting by an artist I did not already know. I just compared the tracks by Eliades Ochoa, and Pio Leyva, with similar tracks on CDs by these artists, and the ones on this CD are less good. They have less punch - they are sort of grey."
2,Coffee table book with great pictures but nothing else,"This book gathers some magnificent pictures of the trip and its preparation. In particular, there are multiple images of bergs and growlers that are breathtaking.However, those of us interested in the story of the trip, its preparation, the re-creation of the ship, the research of the itinerary and, in general, in knowledge about either vikings' shipbuilding technology or seafaring will be greatly disappointed. The text provided in the book amounts to a few lines per page in very large font, and does not attempt to describe any of the research associated with this trip, or even any of the details of the trip itself. There is so little text across the whole book that it can be read in 10 to 15 minutes...If you intend to buy this book, be aware that this is a coffee table book: pictures only. I was interested in knowledge rather than photography - for me it was a total letdown."
5,single greatest influence on my programming abilities,"Quite simply, this book was the single greatest influence on my programming abilities. I firmly believe this should be required reading by everyone who wants to learn how to program.The examples are simple, and you might be tempted to ask yourself why you should write such a simple tool as a word count program, but the examples do a fantastic job of explaining edge cases, performance considerations and all of the other things that separate merely working programs from genuinely good programs.If you want to learn a little bit of ""why"" along with your ""how"", get this book and force yourself to work through all the examples."
2,Missing pages and Out of Date,"This book is an excellent introduction to the Unix philosophy and gives a good sense of the development of the Unix tool set on any platform. Unfortunately, the code in this text relies on compiler specific adaptations that were common with Fortran IV processors, but which strict Fortran 66 and 77 compilers are unable to handle, (Fortran 66 compilers are a rarity anymore). This text is only useful as a reference, but is an interesting read, especially in comparing with Software Tools in Pascal and The C Programming Language. If your intent is to learn the software tools with code that can actually compile, get Software Tools in Pascal.6 pages (145-150) were missing from the copy shipped by Amazon (27th printing). Brian Kernighan and his publisher Pearson were kind to supply both the missing pages and a new copy."
4,A great supplement for a clinical anatomy course.,"I am currently using Ger for my clinical and developmental anatomy course as a first year med student. In addition to a good textbook and atlas, I would highly recommend this book; it provides excellent clinical scenarios and applications of anatomy. (I would not recommend using it as your only book, however.) It is a lighter, easier read than most anatomy texts, and the jokes are often very useful for helping you to remember specific clinical details for your anatomy exam! (I also had the pleasure of having Dr. Ger as a lecturer for the first unit of my anatomy course, and his enthusiasm for anatomy and medicine truly comes out in his writing.)"
4,Chi Flat Iron,I really like this flat iron. I wish I had know that I would not be able to change the degree of heat on this iron.
1,Not what I expected,This obviously wasn't a real Chi. It worked for less than 2 weeks and then wouldn't turn on. The light wouldn't turn on and it wouldn't heat up. Very disappointed and will never buy from this seller again!
1,Fake!,"When I would turn on this iron it would start to give a burning smell, when I contacted the seller, they replaced it for me. Now the new one's ceramic plates are chipping off and thus burning my hair! This item is fake, do not buy it! I went to the Farouk website to find an approved retailer near me and bought a real one for only a little more then what I paid for this one. I suggest anyone who wants a real chi iron to do the same!"
1,Seller did not respond,"Bought a hair straightener 6 months ago. It stopped working a few weeks ago which is abnormal for any hair straightener, let alone one you use once a week. Contacted buyer and never got a response."
1,Chi flat iron,"I was able to use my flat iron ONCE. I was about to finish my hair and all of a sudden the little light went out and my iron went cold. I am not sure what happened but it didn't work any more. I would have loved to send it back for my money, but thinking it was a CHI, I thought I didn't need the box to send it back.I don't know why it worked only once, but I wish it would have been better for the price I paid."
3,A FAKE!!!!,"I purchased these irons and got a notice from Amazon that the actual Farouk company made them aware that the seller was not selling an authentic product. Kudos to Amazon.com for not only notifying me, but refunding ALL of my money. They work ok, but definitely are not a Chi product. However, I got to keep them and they are better than my normal 15.00 flat irons;-)"
4,To Chi or not to Chi,"I was worried when I got my new Chi due to all the reviews about the fake Chi's being sold. I inspected this one from top to bottom comparing it to my original Chi that I bought probably 6-7 years ago. There were a few differences but when I went to the Farouk website, those changes were visible on their website Chi's so I'm satisfied this is not a fake. When testing it, it heated quickly. It moved through my hair easily while doing a great job with straightening. The only difference that I do not like is that it is a 35W instead of 40W like my old Chi. Also, when Amazon advertises that it is an ionic product it is misleading. No where on the original Chi does it say it is ionic. There is however, an ionic iron made by infraTECH by Chi. It is not this one.I think this Chi will do fine. I can only hope the product wasn't cheapened and will last as long as my first one. This was bought from Customer First through Amazon. They were very fast in their delivery."
1,Straightener,"Worked great for about two weeks and then just stopped. Naturally I had already thrown out the box, etc. so I guess I'm just out the money. I knew the price was too good to be true; what a waste."
2,DO NOT GET IT,"This product is not what i thought it was going to be. It doesnt get real hot, and takes 2 times longer to do your hair than usual."
1,Is it authentic,I wonder if the actual device is a Chi flat Iron. I know it came in a CHI box but that is it. Nothing else says CHI and I only had it for one month the words on the actual iron rubbed off in like a week. I am just not truly sure I received what I thought I was purchasing.
4,2nd attempt worked well,"For Christmas I got both my daughters this flat iron. My daughter in Houston reported that hers didn't work after a few weeks. The daughter living at home has reported no problems with hers. I finally bought my Houston daughter another one, and she has reported no problems with it so far, and has had it for about a month. Wish we knew where to send a defective one!"
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this product because I had my other Chi for about 3 years and figured it would be taking a crap on me pretty soon. This flat iron does not heat up therefore it takes double the amount of time to straighten my hair. DON'T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER. Unfortunately you cannot return it, and there is no warranty. I guess you get what you pay for right?"
1,Hair Pulling!,This product pulled my hair when I used it. Must be something with the design on the corners that catches on hair. Vendor was completely unhelpful with my problem. I regret the purchase.
1,Farouk Chi GF 1001,Do not purchase anything from Todayz Dealz through Amazon.com or any other. They sell defective products!!!I recently purchased a Farouk Chi hair straightener and almost got electricuted from it. When plugged in it makes a fast clicking sound and then trips the circuit. Company says they are no longer selling items on here and won't replace my $70.00 hair straightener.
2,cheap,"there is no heat setting, other than burning your hair...It's not smooth at all, it pulls at your hair as you pull it through. very unimpressed. I will stick with Paul Mitchell:) I guess I got what i paid for with this."
1,The Worst!!,"I wish I could rate this -5 stars....I bought a CHI Flat Iron and after three uses, literally 3, it just stopped working....I contacted the seller and they NEVER RESPONDED to my messages whatsoever. I will never buy from this person again."
1,Fake product,"Well I am glad you asked about this product (Ceramic Flat Iron Gf1001 by CHI) that I purchased for my daughter for Christmas. I was very disappointed with this product and can't believe that it is a real CHI. CHI is a great product and that's not what I received. My mother has an off brand that she bought from Sally Beauty Supply and it works so much better. I always thought of Amazon as a safe reputable company but it seems that you aren't any safer than any other company on the internet. I have done my Christmas shopping with Amazon for 2 years. It was convenient and easy, and until this purchase, I was completely satisfied. I have to be honest, I just purchased a laptop computer (Lenovo) this past weekend and was too afraid to make a big purchase like this from Amazon because of what happened with this flat iron (which thank God was under $100). Who knows if I would have received a quality product or not. Thank you for letting me share my frustration/opinion.Angela Brooks"
1,piece of crap,I bought this product 4 months ago and it's already broken! do not buy! I should have know because it was the cheaper one.
1,DO NOT BUY - NOT AN AUTHORIZED RETAILER,"CHI and other Farouk Systems products are only sold through authorized salon retailers, and Amazon is not one of them. (This also includes CHI products sold at places like Target.) The warranty will be INVALID, meaning there is no guarantee on this product should it break, etc. Many make this mistake and think they can buy CHI products and styling tools online, but they are WRONG. If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM."
1,Flimsy power cord,"Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord. Farouk refuses to send replacement cord at any cost so my wife now has a worthless $100 flat iron. Power cord, which should last indefinitely, is very poorly designed."
2,Takes forever to straighten. Broke after 1 week.,"I have another flat iron that's even worse, so I opted to give this two stars. Before it broke it took twice as long to straighten my hair as the much cheaper Conair 2"" Professional that you can get at Target. That one broke too after about a year or so, but for $20 I can stomach replacing it every year or two. I actually had went back to find a replacement Conair but they were sold out, so in desperation I purchased this one. I SERIOUSLY don't see what the fuss is about on this flat iron... it's mediocre at best, and broke. Sorry, no recommendation here."
4,Chi Ceramic Flat Iron works pretty well and leaves my hair silky smooth.,"I have thick hair so sometimes it doesn not want to hold the style that I wish is to hold but the Chi Ceramic Flat Iron works better than most other flat irons I have used and and leaves my hair silky and smooth. So far I have not noticed any hair damage or breakage, A BIG PLUS."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"tHIS IS MY SECOND PRODUCT BY CHI... I LOVE THE NANO , GREAT TEMPERTURE STRAIGTENS HAIR INSTANTLY.. WORKS WELL WITH MAZULA OIL BY MOTIONS(FOR WOMEN OF COLOR) OVERALL GREAT PRODUCT"
2,Shipping,"Hi I just want to say that I ordered my merchandise on may 17 and was told it would be here around the 25th I didn't mind a couple of days late, but we are on june 2 and is still not here. I am just hoping that the next time I order something it wont be so late. I am still gonna shop here again this is the first time I ordered something for amazon, and I will give it another chance."
5,For the Cat Lover,Informative book about cats. A must for people who like cats and want to learn more about them. /tells about caring for your cat as well asdifferent breeds.
3,My Daughter is a Care Bear Enthusiast,"I purchased this care bear for my nearly 3 year old daughter. She is a complete care bear enthusiast. She absolutely loves this care bear. Ever since she got it for Christmas, she takes it to bed with her, she drives it around in her doll stroller and she takes it to the table with her. The only downside is that the tummy symbol is beginning to come off already. I wish that these bears were made to be more durable. We purchased this at Target, but it was months ago and they are no longer in stock. $8.99 is twice what we paid, but these bears are extremely hard to find."
4,A very good read,"I imagine few lives have contained so many varied life threatening experiences as Hugh Glass', and few more deserving of legendary status. As sailor, reluctant pirate, honorary Pawnee and fur trapper he time and again escapes death from pirates, cannibals, human sacrifice, Indian ambush, grizzly mauling and frozen wilderness. His fending for himself while dragging his torn broken body hundreds of miles after the grizzly mauling being the most miraculous. The author admittedly takes some liberties in creating a narrative that is much more readable than any recitation of the facts could be. But the essence and significant events are all based on well documented facts. It's a very readable telling of an amazing story."
4,Quite an Adventure Story!,"My husband and I enjoyed the story of Hugh Glass. We purchased the book as a result of seeing a program about him on the History Channel. Lots of those same things were in the book plus lots more. I feel the author took a considerable amount of artistic privilege with some of the items in the book but it was easy to detect the real facts and it all turned out to show that Hugh Glass was an amazingly adventurous, rugged, determined and versatile man. The author lets the reader know that he has taken some artistic license in the writing of the book . My husband and I liked the fact that Hugh Glass was portrayed as a man with a conscience. With all that in mind, I would highly recommend this book."
5,Just what you need,"We travel a lot and are a multi-lingual family, so we play DVDs from the US, Europe and China. This player can handle PAL and NTSC and also ignores the really annoying region code. I have yet to find a DVD this thing can't handle. I prefer it many times over my $200 Sony player which rejects half of my disks and has a terribel error correction flaw. If you want to play DVDs from Europe and the US, this player is great !"
3,Puppies and Babies? Not as entertaining as you may think,"My daughter is 13 months old.. and this one.. just.. doesn't keep her attention. The music isn't quite as involved, and while there are puppies and babies.... nothing quite... catches her, or draws her in. She loves elmo's kids favorite songs, and the potty training DVD, but this one... not so much. Perhaps it will work better with younger lil ones."
2,Not enough puppet characters!,This video is boring. Too much talking and too little talking from the muppet characters. Might be suited more for an older child but mine is 13 months so there has to be constant colorful characters for her to be interested.
2,"Entertaining, but not very educational","I was hoping for a video that would teach my toddler how to treat my baby and dog. This video, while it's cute, didn't do that. It basically shows different types of babies and dogs."
5,Our family favorite,"Our daughter LOVES this video! She cries for it every day, and we have to watch it over and over again. She especially loves watching the babies and puppies. She will go and get her stuffed dog and sit down with it. We will buy more Elmo videos for her (also telling the grandparents).I highly recommend this video to other mothers."
2,"Too many animals, too few babies","We were really disappointed with the Babies section of this DVD. I bought it because my daughter loves pictures of other babies, but it turns out that there are only 2 (very short) segments about actual babies, and then the rest of the entire Babies segment is about animal babies. Especially since the other segments of the DVD are already about animals (dogs and farm animals), this was too few babies and too many animals for us. If you're looking for a video of babies, buy a different one!"
3,nice dvd,My two year old loves elmo (The Best of Elmo 1 and 2). The only thing is that at his age he likes songs and dances but he loves animals so I though he might like this dvd. He does not have the patience yet to sit through all the talking and therefore has a hard time sitting through the whole dvd.
5,Kids love it,Everyone knows Elmo's World is the best part of Seaseme Street! So why not buy a DVD that has just that. You never have to fast forward to the good stuff.
1,Irritating,"My 15 mos old granddaughter has this video. She likes it, but BOY is irritating for anyone else in the room. I can't understand much of what Elmo says and after awhile that voice gets on my nerves. There are much better videos out there. May I recommend some of the Veggie Tales."
1,"I could write a better show. No, my baby could.","This show absolutely drives me crazy. The cartoons are horrible, the annoying voice. My daughter pays attention to it for a while, but I think I'm going to get rid of this thing. It's a jumbled mess of a show.Also I think Mr. Noodle must be the director's out of work father in law that needs some work to buy some booze. What place does he have on that show? Who thought that would be a good idea? It makes no sense."
1,"Strange! It is all about bottlefeeding, etc.","hmmm. One would think that the makers of Sesame Street would know that breast is best, but, unfortunately, the video shows a bottle in almost every scene that it shows a baby! Not once does it show a baby nursing! Not even an animal baby! Even the animals are fed with bottles in the video! It makes bottlefeeding appear to be the norm (certainly NOT what I want to teach my child)! It also refers repeatedly to ""babysitters."" I would never leave a baby with a ""babysitter"" and I certainly wouldn't want to teach my child that babysitters are the norm either. Babies should be with their mothers wherever their mothers go! This video is not for anyone who is a breastfeeding, attached parent."
3,Elmo still rules!,"My 2 yr old son enjoys watching this video but then again he will watch anything ELMO! There are parts of the video that are cute and my son is mesmorized by the babies & dogs & then there are parts like Mr. Noodle that he's not interested in. There is one scene that scares my son. It's the scene where Oscar the grouch goes into his garbage can & it gets really dark. All you see are a bunch of eyeballs - some scary - bouncing around on the tv screne. It lasts a couple of minutes & my son starts screaming & gets scared. Does this happen to anyone elses child? I always have to fast forward the video at that part. I am very surprised they would put something so scary in a little kids video! Other than that scary scene, he enjoys the video."
5,My son loves this one,"My 10 month old son especially enjoys the first episode about babies. If you already own Elmo's world pets, the dog episode is the same. One of my son's first words was ""dog"" from watching this episode."
5,3 Baby Favorites!!!,"This DVD has my daughters 3 favorite subjects, Babies, Dogs and Farm. My 1 year old wakes up every morning and sits on her Zebra, points to the TV, and says ""bow wow wow wow"" which mean ""I want to watch Elmo's World about Dogs""She likes all three episodes but the Dogs stick out for her because she has seen (and been afraid of) real dogs)"
5,Great Video,My 18 mth old son loves it. He laughs like its the funniest thing he's ever saw. (of course I'm the funniest thing)(from the DAD)
4,Paper in Art,"This book is full of paper craft for kids to make--at school, at home, at grandma's--in their free time. We used some of the crafts to decorate our Christmas tree. Some can also be used at package tie decorations. The possibilities are pretty much limited by your imagination."
4,One of the best of the TV series,"For the most part, the half-hour TV versions of Winnie-the-Pooh leave a lot to be desired for fans of the bear of little brain. Sparks of the characterization and warmth evident in the original movie show occasionally. Sure, they're worth viewing, but often leave you wanting more.""Stripes,"" however, is one of the best televised efforts. There's a familiar, simple, underlying message; a new (albeit not fully realized) song; and an actual story arc. This is one that will entertain and teach children, and manages also to not nauseate adults longing for the ""classic"" Pooh bear."
2,Average,A bit more than salt and pepper is needed to spice up this soundtrack. Just like the film - a flop!
4,An Artist & the Pope/Giacomo Manzu,Good book if for just the history. Not particularly well written but worth the information.
4,Momma's Kitchen is Delightful,"Momma's kitchen isn't just to cook in -- it's also a place to sing, to play, to reminisce, to get together, to share, to live and to love! Colin Bootman's oil paintings are perfect complements to these short, short stories. The story about Great Aunt Caroline is the cream in this kitchenful of stories!"
3,Great Product! Powerful Smell!,We really like this lotion as it will make your skin very smooth and soft but it comes at a price of really coming on strong with the smell. You may really love the smell and that will be great but if you don't that's where things could become a problem. Again great lotion super strong smell!
5,I LOVE THIS LOTION,"My husband, of all people, turned me on to this lotion. His students at the school he worked at used it all the time. I've been using it for at least 10 years. It's very moisturizing and very fragrant, it leaves your skin feeling and smelling good all day. Thankfully here in Philly they sell Razac in all the beauty supply stores and also in RITE Aid stores so I'm never without. Buy this lotion today, you will not be disappointed!!"
1,Oooh That Smell!,A coworker wears this stuff and it stinks up the place for a good 10 minutes every time he passes by. Definitely overpowering and smelly. If you want to put off your coworkers this is the stuff to wear.
5,RAZAC LOTION,"This is a great product.It's a moisturizer hand and body lotion, a protectant against weathered sensitived skin, it's rich non-greasy, and softens the skin instantly. I love the scent of this lotion.I find myself using perfume less."
5,"Need some ball joints for camera pole, for GoPro camera","Nothing to corrode, but even brass and aluminun will corrode if not washed in fresh water and the lubed. Its simple, cheap, and I needed some of them to mount on a PVC pipe bolted to an end cap, to dip for video in salt water. Works for me, NOT a nice tripod head for a large camera. Its great for DIY uses."
4,Always love them Rookies!,I didn't watch this finale when it aired because I was afraid it would be a terrible cliffhanger and I didn't want to wait it suspense. It was a great show.
1,Soap opera romance,This series seems to be primarily a romance series with a little police procedural thrown in. And romance between co-workers? That's a situation so ripe for disaster I could not stomach the thought of enduring more.
5,I love Rookie Blue,"Awesome product, exactly like the description. I love the show so this was a must have for any fan. I am glad I found such a great deal on Amazon. Will definitely be purchasing the third season when it is release and will buy from this seller again in the future."
4,Just what I expected.,I was replacing a lost Carolina throw and this throw was all I wanted and expected. Resonable price and the quality if good. Many games to watch in my recliner under my throw. Go Heels! Beat Duke
2,Not the best,"seems like a cheap pair of tweezers made in china, the two blades don't match when i push them together and it's quite hard to push them anyway, require a bit of strengthwhich might not be an issue for a strong men but might be hard to use for a woman or even impossible to debone a whole fish without getting hand cramps."
1,Poor,I don't like this at all! It is tough to press it. Your hand would be very tired after you finish picking bones on one fish!
4,"Slightly shallow, but heaps of fun","While not the ideal book for someone looking for trenchant political analysis of the Middle East, Horwitz does a great job of vividly bringing the foibles of life in the region to life. His years of meandering travels as a freelance journalist gave him a great vantage point from which to see the region. But in a post 9/11 world, it is hard to read the book without thinking about how the great gulf in cultures that makes much of the Middle East a mystery to Horwitz has altered our world.Even with that sobering thought popping up repeatedly, this book has loads of laugh out loud moments and Horwitz's language is never less than spirited. Basically, the book is a fun way to experience the Middle East without the hassles associated with actually traveling through the region."
3,worth your time,"A highly informative and enjoyable book on one of the most volatile regions of the world. The author successfully describes Mid-East culture, not by quoting long dead historians or re-hashing other people research, but by visiting the region first hand. When the author visits a country he does not simply reserve a room at the local Sheraton and report from the hotel bar, like so many foreign correspondents. Instead, he moves out into the street, befriends locals, and stays in their hotels and eats where they eat. The author does not claim to be an academic expert on Arab culture, but I believe this frees him to make observations that are not weighed down by academic requirements. The author's sense of humor is an added bonus. While the book was written over 10 years ago, it still holds up well. This book is more than a travel book, it is a first rate description of Arab culture from the gritty streets of the Middle East."
5,Travel Guide to War Zones,"This is the second time I will be purchasing Baghdad Without a Map to give as a gift. I have also loaned my copy to several friends, who all loved it.The book is best categorized as travel writing of the personal journal variety. Horwitz fearlessly puts himself in a variety of dangerous, humorous or interesting situations in places around the Middle East. But it goes beyond some travel journals in its insight into the societies he visits, and the people he meets. It is the sort of personal insight that travelers hope to discover on their travels. The sections on Iran were a revelation to me.Originally written before the Gulf War, it has a final chapter describing his return after the war. Now the Middle East is in the news again, and although Horwitz didn't travel to Afghanistan, his stories are timely once again. Not to mention that the book is a terrific read. Buy it for yourself or as a gift."
3,A journalistic diary,"Book was a good read and interesting as few books explore the travel diaries through the Middle East. However, it's written from the perspective of a male journalist whom I had a more difficult time relating with. Though I have traveled through many of those same countries in the Middle East, he traveled not as a backpacker but as a journalist. Still fascinating, but not the perspective I was hoping for / could relate to."
5,Wonderful stuff,"I remember seeing this on the television years ago and have wanted to see it again ever since so I purchased the scripts, not as funny as I remember but scripts never are still this is probably Ayckbourn at his best reminds me of Thorogoods Drop Dead Gorgeous, I will cherish the script for a long time. Recomended."
5,Hilarious,"I have been a fan of this play for years and was thrilled to get a new copy[well,new to me].It is one of the funniest plays ever and would love to see it on the stage.Alan Ayckbourn is hilarious and The Norman Conquests one of the cleverest plays I've ever read."
1,Stay away from it!,"Dont buy it, its a completely piece of junk! No, dont ever think it has something to do with Buddha Bars, Nirvanas, Siddhartas, etc. The 3 CD's are worth more for their blisters than for their music. Completely vague music, no beautiful compositions, no nothing!. This is the music you average Joe can do in his PC at his house. If you still want to buy it, go ahead but remember my warning. Save the money and buy Buddha Bars or any Claude Challe album."
5,Heart & Soul,I have watched the Temptations movie over and over again and every time I get the same warm feeling because their story has so much heart and soul. Even though I have been a fan of The Temptations forever I love the group even more each time I watch the movie. The music is great and the acting is flawless!I respect Otis Williams for telling it like it is and for keeping the group going while maintaining high Motown standards. Otis reminds me of Mary Wilson who was the force behind the power of The Supremes.These guys make me proud to be a black man.Thanks to Suzanne dePasse for producing this gem!
4,Caliber Review,"I purchased the Caliber GPS for myself and then one for my daughter. We both find them relatively easy to use and accurate finding locations. The battery life when charged and not used is not the longest and could be improved. I use the cigarette lighter cord and have no difficulties with power. The window mount works adequately well but can com loose if not moistened prior to attaching. Overall I feel this is a good value item, cost versus function. Hard to find one that will do as well for the money."
1,I do not recommend. Unreliable unit.,Purchased this unit for upcoming trip to Canada. Once there the unit will was not able to find the address instead kept displaying some error became useless. Had to relay on the paper maps. Called the customer service and could not speak to anyone and had to leave the message. No one called back. Finally downloaded the software to be able to use the unit. Tried to use in NJ and ended up at some different address. Totally unreliable unit. Have not been able to use it. I would have returned the unit but I did not test the unit in a timely manner so it was too late to return. I am stuck with this useless unit.
1,NOT at all Recommended,"All,I purchased this product and found following issues:1) Too slow to respond in San Francisco area2) 50% of times it complains that SD card is not inserted properly, however, in reality it is inserted. You then have to take it out and re-insert and restart.3) One has to go through long process for adjusting the volume4) One has to accept the terms every time this unit is started5) Customer service requires one to leave a message and the response is not prompt.Conclusion, if you value your $$, do NOT buy this unit.Alpesh"
4,Excellent and Challenging Particularly for Beginners,"This title is proving to be everything I needed-and then some! What impresses me most is the consistency of the contents. I have discovered zero errors in the book. There is much hands-on, and plenty of 'little extras' that contribute to the reader's knowledge. Illustrations are plentiful. The text covers topics ranging from starting the program, to macros. If there ever was a book that 'takes the reader by the hand' and yet allows the reader to maintain his dignity, this is it! I will definitely look for these authors before making a similar purchase."
4,Excellent intro to tough topic,"Provides a very good hands-on approach to using MSAccess. The text introduces a concept which is then immediately reinforced with either a pictorial example or an on-computer exercise (or both!). Not as cute as some of the other books written to provide ""off line"" documentation. I own a lot of do-it-yourself computer books and I was very pleased with this one (and its companion on Excel)"
5,Simple design; fast downloads,"I purchased this handy device after one too many frustrating encounters between my Sony w300i phone and Windows Media Player, characterized by slow download speeds and a painfully awkward interface. The card reader has proven a good workaround. The reader and WMP get along famously and the job is soon done, with noticeably faster uploads via a USB 2.0 port.The reader itself is convenient to use. After extracting the M2 memory stick from the phone (or other device), you slide it part way into the slot, then push the devices's lever forward. That extends the USB plug while pulling the card the rest of the way in. Practice makes perfect, and fingernails, to handle the dainty micro-card, help."
1,does not fit,I bought this flame arrestor for my 4.3 mercruiser and found the flange mount is way to big so now I'm stuck with an item i can't use.
3,Pretty good,"The story line kept me interested, and it wasn't so difficult, like other games I've tried to play, that I had to give up. I was able to complete and win this game within a nice timeframe, and didn't get really frustrated. Diehard gamers might find this not to their liking, but someone who likes to figure things out and not feel like a game is impossible, will like it."
3,Buyer Beware,"Buyers Beware this is not the original version of Fable, prior to lost chaptering, this is infact a completely differant game. I guess my first clue should have been that it was not made by LionHead. Nothing wrong with this little game, its just not the one I want."
3,Interesting story.,"Didn't realize when I bought it that it was so-o-o old! Life changes so quickly, novels get dated very fast."
3,"Good product, Don't buy from S&S Worldwide!",I wanted to have a big supply of fingerpaint for my son for the summer. I ordered this paint from S&S Worldwide more than 15 days ago and I am still waiting for it. At this rate the summer will be over before we receive the fingerpaint. I read other costumers had the same problem with this seller more than two years ago! so I don't think their costumer service has improved at all. Look for other venues to buy this product.
3,Good product/so-so service,The paint is good but the problem is that the shipment was done by a third party and it took too long. i should have known better and stick only to the items that AMAZON ships.
4,Definitely get this one!,"I have seen this band a couple times at different bars on Franklin Street. They are always good, but this cd has really made a fan out of me. I don't actually own many jazz cd's, but after checking out this one I'm sure I'll get some more. Go see them live if you can!"
1,no good,"It turned black in 1 mth, in my opinion you get what you pay for, otherwise its pretty when new but if you deside to where it ,it turns black."
2,S L O W moving space pictures,S L O W moving space pictures. Unless you're a space nut save your money. Ted Cool
1,absolute trash !!,"John Foster Dulles should be ashamed for his book. I do not know him personally but this book shows that he was an ignorant lunatic and a true disciple of Jo McCarthy. While we in the western world do not favor Communism, it is silly and idiotic to treat it as a contagious disease. With an open door policy, we could show the people in Communist countries that our system is better and in every way gives people security and pleasure. The worst thing to do is, as Dulles advocated, to to fight them head on. Dulles must have contributed a lot to the utterly crazy Cold War tension and perhaps the Vietnam War. I am glad that finally the American people had come to their senses, adopted an open-door policy with Russia and China and made the world much safer and happier. Dulles is no longer alive and I hope he will rot in hell"
5,Revived My Interest in Contemporary American Theater,"I owe a tremendous debt to this play and to Itamar Moses. I went to an early production in Ithaca, New York and found it so intellectually powerful and riotously funny that I became an avid follower of the contemporary theater scene and of Moses especially. You cannot read this play and continue thinking that modern America is a cultural wasteland. Moses combines artistic substance, formal ingenuity, and fall-out-of-your-seat humor to create an experience that delights you while you're in it and stays with you afterward. BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT! Your hope for America's arts will be restored."
5,Great play!,Saw the play at my college but the booklet was in perfect condition. Didn't realize how small it was before i got it.
2,A Play Without Bach & a Lot of Other Things,"Perhaps if I'd seen the play, not read the play, I could have given ""Bach in Leipzig"" 3 stars, but I didn't and can't. Sure it helps if you know your Bach, his selection in Leipzig, the structure of the fugue and the frequency of old German fore names, but really that doesn't help enough. I did not find the play engaging, or funny, or worth the time I spent reading through it. I wish I had."
2,"The most lackluster ""tribute"" ever produced...","The version of ""Roland..."" presented here is the only thing that keeps this from a 1 star rating. It's dull and lacks any of the intensity or originalitly that Zevon brought to the original recordings of these songs. ""Enjoy Every Sandwhich"" has some great moments and heartfelt tributes, this is an insult to a genius."
1,Not worth it- except for the cover-art,I thought that I'd enjoy anything musically attached to the great Warren Zevon. This CD has disproved that. The best part of the enitre CD is the cover art. Save your $ and avoid
5,A must-have book you'll keep re-reading,"A lot of self-help books have just the opposite effect than is intended: You feel so overwhelmed, so daunted by the work in front of you, you want to just hide or lie down. Not this one! Here's advice you'll enjoy reading and can't wait to put into practice--and you'll see results immediately.Greene is inspirational without sounding mushy; he's insightful without sounding like a shrink; and despite his military background, his tone is anything but drill sargeant--he's actually funny. I usually hate spending $20 on a hardcover, but this is the least expensive and most effective ""therapy"" I've ever gotten."
2,Not so great,I was really disappointed with this DVD. It didn't give me the best look into Beirut. It didn't show very much of downtown and it went into things that weren't even a big part of the Lebanese culture like the whole part on the break dancing kids in the street. My boyfriend is from there and he's never even seen these guys. It just seemed to waste time that they could be spending documenting more interesting things. I will say that the special part all about Lebanese cuisine was at least some what fun to watch.
1,"DON""T BUY THIS VIDEO!!!","A stupefyingly awful animated version of King Kong (which means it is still better than the live-action remake of the 70's, all copies of which should be confiscated and burned.). Whose bright idea was it to make kids wait through 40 minutes of bad songs before even getting to the island? After which Kong takes on all prehistoric comers in a tag-team match lasting about 5 minutes total. Then we get more bad songs. If you already own the original movie (an all-time great adventure) and you want to buy your children a Kong-related product try Anthony Brown's pretty decent storybook retelling. But skip this embarassingly bad piece of dreck! I'd give it no stars if that were an option."
5,"Awesome product, go for it......you will not regret","This clipper is awesome. Very comfortable to use, and extremely small and lightweight. The length of the cord is pretty decent (although i would have liked it to be a foot longer) and works for me. The blade does not conk out in a few uses, and actually lasts for a long long time. I havent had the opportunity to replace it yet. Its not too noisy either, although there are other clippers in the market that are less noisy but pricey as well. To summarize, its great value for your money, as you are buying a genuine quality product."
4,Okay little trimmer,"Bought for my husband for keeping his goatee and sideburns trimmed, does the job, not bad for a good price"
3,Works well but one complaint,"I would give these clippers 5 stars but unfortunately you cannot buy/use any other wahl comb attachments like 1/16th for a closer shave, you can only use the four clippers that accompany the set."
5,good product,"I bought these clippers to shave my son's head, and they do a great job. Very close without any burn using no attachments, and it is very easy to use, fits well in the hand, is quiet and powerful. My son has incredibly thick hair and this went right through it."
1,return item,this item does not meet my expectations. it is to loud for my small dog and scares the animal. i would like to return it but have no info on sender and no return paperwork?
1,Dead after just 3 months,"I bought this trimmer for my husband on December, 2011. Well, it died on him past week. This was his third Peanut in 20 years. The first one lasted about 12 years, the second one, about 8... and this one, 3 months? Unacceptable.It seems that the Peanut is now DISPOSABLE."
1,Wahl Professional 8685 Peanut Classic Clipper/trimmer,"I bought this hair clipper to replace my old one, which just wore out from use. My old ""Peanut"" clipper came with a very nice limber electrical cord and it was easy to use and stored away nicely. The new one came with a very large and very, very stiff cord and is full of kinks which I cannot remove. This makes the clipper awkward to use and impossible to store. I don't recommend buying this clipper, unless you're into frustration!"
4,Great little trimmer,Only used this once but so far I like it. It is a nice sharp cut and I like the small size for maneuvering around my five year old son's head.
3,missleading ad,"I ordered the peanut with hard case, the invoice read ""with hard case"", but the hard case was not sent and the peanut shaver arrived in a bubble pack. There was no return address or phone number to call. I will never deal with this outfit again."
1,Did not work for Autistic Child of 3 yrs of age...,"I could see this being a good touch up clipper for my husband in between haircuts. But other than that this thing is useless to us.Our son is 3yrs old, and has Autism. If you have a child with autism you understand that this is not at all a fun task. He has thick hair that grows very quickly, and I can quite honestly say that this was by far his worse experience. I think it was pulling his hair. We oiled it and still no luck.We are looking at the Norelco for kids...we will not be using this one again on him."
1,Retarded Haircutter,"I purchased this to trim my sideburns. But I was completely disappointed. It doesn't function well as a trimmer. The blade is dull and doesn't trim clean, not like the trimmer I see at some barbar shops. The worst thing about it is that it's too damn loud, as already noted by some reviewers who rate it with 1 or 2 stars. I wish I had listened to them. Even though only a small number of people gave 1 or 2 stars, do not ignore them--they are the truth!!"
2,not satisfied,"very tiny named appropriately, not easy handling, not satisfied with the product. Doest not cut clean as well, some times the hait is stuck as well and a little bit noisy as well."
5,Super embroidery tool,"This shaver works perfectly to remove stitches from my embroidery designs. If you buy an embroidery machine, this should be your second purchase."
3,Beard Trimmer,"I bought this to trim my beard at certain length and have it neatly trimmed. It does an ok job, but I have to take the plastic piece off and trim a few stragglers each time. So it is not perfect for what I wanted it to do."
5,Review of Peanut Beard trimmer,This trimmer is really handy. It's small enough to fit easily in my hand. The blades are strong enough to trim the beard really well and the attachments work well. I would recommend it for men who need to trim their beards periodically. It's called the Wahl Peanut Beard Trimmer.
4,Snazzy new haircuts,"I love to be able to get my haircut at home now. It saves me time, money, and frustration of waiting at a barbershop or salon. My haircut is very simple...I get the comb S2 all the way around and that is it. It takes all of 5 minutes and my head feels great. I was tired of going to get my haircut every 3 weeks and either having to get there early or wait in line and pay more than necessary for a simple haircut. This thing will literally save me hundreds of dollars a year and my hair will look the same. It is a simple, powerful clipper that does a great job cutting hair and styling neck hair or sideburns. I gave it 4 stars for a funny smell protruding from the device, but it works fine other than that. Ray"
5,Amazing machine,"I was getting tired of Philips machine. It wasn't like professional cut. I paid like 16$. Anyhow, fast forward, I saw this at the barber shop. I was quite impressed with its efficiency and accuracy. In short, this is one amazing machine. Will buy again!"
5,Home and health products,"I've owned a Wahl Peanut for around five years, it always performed perfectly, until I dropped it on the floor, and broke it! I just received my new one, it works exactly the same. I use it to trim by beard, etc. A really dependable little machine that I highly reccomend!"
4,Pretty nice little set of clippers.,I would recommend these to friends. I use them for my pets and they are quiet and durable. Heavy duty long cord and easy to clean with the 'pop off' blade head. I give these an A!
5,Great little clipper!!,"This is so very handy. I am basically bald. I use a $100 Andis clipper with a #1 cutting guide for the sides. The Peanut is the perfect for the final touches. My wife says the Peanut allows her to give my head the ""perfect horse shoe."""
3,Its ok,This buzzer is small but its pretty powerful for its size. I always cuz my boyfriends hair and I thought it would be more convenient to use something smaller but it takes a lot longer to cut hair with this little guy than the average buzzer. This little peanut is strong but if your going to invest money into something get something strong but larger. It can sometimes get annoying holding it too because its so small.
1,Died rather quickly,My Wahl Peanut Clipper died in less than a year in a non-professional family usage on thick hair. I would have thought this clipper should have lasted in a non-professional setting. I now have the Oster Professional 76023-510 Fast Feed Clipper and it is very durable and it has been working 2 years now.
2,disappointed customer,"I brought this for by boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it, but barely used it and now it doesnt work. I'm very disappointed."
4,peanut wahl trimmer,a great little trimmer. good for inbetween going to the groomer with the dog. easy to handle and does a good job
4,Cape Codder Opinion,"Easy to use and I have no prior experience.Only complaint is the starter bottle of oil for lubricating the head of the trimmer. After first use, the plastic oil bottle leaked even when the cap felt snug. Had to wipe up oil and then store the plastic bottle in another container to keep it from tipping over."
4,good little razor,I bought this razor seven years ago and used it continually through out the ensuing years. Just bought a new one -- I wish all products lasted this long and were so reliable as to only need to replace it every 7 years.
5,Excellent product offered at a bargain price!,"I bought my Wahl 8685 Peanut to replace a much larger Wahl unit my father purchased in the mid-1950s. That unit is still working, but it's too cumbersome for trimming my beard. The PEANUT is a wonder of compactness and cutting power married to the Wahl reputation for sound engineering and durability. I was somewhat put off by a few negative comments by Amazon customer reviewers regarding the ""fragile"" plastic attachments. Don't worry about It! They're plenty durable if you're reasonably careful handling them: they ARE plastic, after all. Reasonable care is all that's required. ""Excessive noise"" seemed to be another issue for the negative reviewers. I did NOT find this unit to be overly noisy, given the size and power of the cutting heads. IMHO: you can't go wrong with the Peanut... period!"
2,Trimmer no good for sensitive toddler heads,"We purchased this trimmer on recommendation because it was supposed to be easier on sensitive toddler heads. Instead, the trimmer seems to be getting louder over time with stronger and stronger vibrations. The last time I tried to cut my son's hair, he absolutely refused to stay still and screamed bloody murder non-stop. These clippers might be good for older kids to use, but it is useless for sensitive toddlers."
5,wahl,"We bought it thinking that might not work really well, but Oh! surprise, yes it does, we had another one similar and didn't work as good as this one, my husband likes it a lot."
3,3 Stars come in small packages.,"I like this clipper because it is pretty solid for its size and I have a small bathroom from living in a NYC apartment. I bought this one after i failed to maintain my old one and it rusted. This model has far less power and width but is much easier to handle and maneuver. Its really up to what youre looking for. Oh my other model was also wahl and much more powerful but at the same time, much bigger."
5,Great beard trimmer,"Nimble to use, quick to clean up, great quality.I think it is better suited for beard rather than hair trimming (I own a bigger Wahl hair clipper, their good quality is partly why I went with Wahl for the beard trimmer)."
5,Very nice product !,My wife bought me this one for myself and she knew that this product is rocking as she was using this during her Cosmetology classes. This product works so great that! Quality is like next to the razor (shaving) !! and for the same reason I bought another one for my in-laws. and they love it too !!
5,Six Months Almost Daily Use=Thumbs Way Up!,"I have put the Peanut through its paces over the last six months. The verdict is in--As a beard trimmer, this is a winner. I've used it every 2 days or so without the slightest problem or complaint. It is easy to clean, requires very little maintenance, and will trim to any length you want. I was a bit paranoid about rust, but a drop or two of any machine oil, even 3 in 1, will protect for weeks, probably months, unless you somehow dunk it in salt water. Barbers advise me to be careful about exposing it constantly to the steam from baths/showers, so I don't do that."
3,Not for thick hair,I find it takes forever to cut my son's hair using the Peanut. I have had for two years but I am looking for an upgrade
3,Clippers,Very small clippers. I recommend it very practical. Does a good job cutting but only goes to #4. Would like to see more #s.
2,Not a good product,"I got this clipper to replace a 15 year old con-air that (finally) dulled the blades. I heard good things about the Wahl brand, but am disappointed with the Peanut. Every haircutting session from day 1 involves me oiling the blades at least twice per cut, and having to constantly remove hair from the blade. If I don't do it, the clipper jams. Continuously having to remove the attachment in order to pull oily (from oiling the blades) hair off while also keeping the blades oiled... and yet still having the clipper (painfully) pull hair instead of cutting it... nonstop fun."
5,a great buy,small but power WOW great for little kids and cleaning up the neck line ... I going to buy another one
4,Decent trimmer,"Got this for my boyfriend and he likes it. If you want a fairly close trim, dont use any attachment at all. The only thing he didn't like is that you are supposed to oil it every time you use it."
3,Was great while it worked,"I brought the Wahl peanut trimmer on a long trip (3 months). It worked great for about 6 weeks and then abruptly stopped working. Up to that point, I loved the product. It felt sturdy and the motor ran strong. After it stopped working I thought I could hear a loose piece on the inside."
4,"So far, so good","I haven't had this litter box (globe?) for very long, but so far I like it. More importantly, so do my cats. I have two that are over 15 lbs., but the Litter Robot is holding up. The only problem I have isn't with the robot, it's with one of the big cats. 17 lb Sam doesn't always turn around when he uses it, so his furry little butt hangs outside when he poops. But that's his problem (and mine), not the robot's. I suppose if it was bigger (or Sam was smaller) it would accomodate him, but I really can't imagine it being any bigger. It does have a smaller footprint than other automatic litter boxes I've had, but it's still pretty big. Quite a conversation starter, though! People are always facinated."
1,Disappointing,"I'm sorry to say, despite my high hopes, I'm disappointed with this product. Although it was quite easy to set up, it never worked right and after three weeks, it doesn't work at all. Initially, it would go through its cycle just fine, but for some reason, the waste would not end up in the collector tray. Then the motor jammed and I can't find any visible problem. To add insult to injury, my cat has decided he doesn't need to go all the way in the hole in order to pee - he just stands in the entrance and pees on the floor...I have not yet called customer service so I can't comment further. I'm hopeful that the problems I have can be resolved and, if so, I'll be happy to modify review accordingly."
3,Disappointing,"After reading the majority of reviews I expected more. Unfortunately, neither cat was very comfortable and found the space a bit constricting. I constantly had to clean poop off the steps and would find my cats head covered in litter. It might work well for some, but not for me."
2,Great Idea Doesn't Work Here,"Actually, I love it but the cats don't so it's an expensive failed experiment. ONe cat used it once, stood at a distance watching with alarm as it whirred and gently, quietly did it's electronic thing and she never went back. It's a great alternative to the other automatic boxes that break a lot, but I don't know how to entice the critters to use it."
2,Our 2 cats didn't like it,"Plain and simple, our cats were terrified of the noise this things makes. But I gave it 2 stars because I can see how wonderful it would be if our cats did like it.I also included a photo because the cat this company used to market the litter robot must be enormous. I placed a milk carton next to it for a reality check."
2,get this only if you have money to burn,"all was well with the litter robot. (a little loud when turning, but not a big deal.)until a year and half later, when the base crapped out. the warranty is only for a year. but to get this fixed, we would need to get the base packed and shipped to michigan. cost of packing and shipping would be roughly $80. it's not heavy, but it is pretty big and USPS now charges for oversized items. but on top of that, we would be charged for the repair, as well as the cost for shipping it back.i took this to a local electrician. the guy couldn't even get in there because the base is riveted together.cost of new base with shipping? about $200.buy at your own risk."
3,Not all that,"I think the idea of the Litter Robot is better than the reality. It works ok, but mine kept going off at odd times cycling itself. Sometimes it would continuously run a cleaning cycle for no reason. Even when I set the sensitivity to low it still suffered from going off too much, when the cat hadn't even been anywhere near it.Also, my cat makes a huge mess with the litter when exiting it, but the other reviews already mention this.Overall, the sheer size makes it too large to place comfortably in any apartment-- you're definitely not going to be able to find a place out of the way where it won't be noticeable. The price and bulk makes me want to try the $40 version that works similarly, but instead of a motor turning the thing around, you're the one to do that part."
2,Works awesome but not built to last,"Purchased this unit 7 months ago. Once I got our 2 cats to use it life was good. Unit easily cleans litter as described for a week before needing litter tray emptying.The problem is this thing relies on motors, power supply, and a circuit board to operate efficiently daily. When most cats urinate they keep they're 2 front paws out of the box, occasionally some of that will spill over in the front. This has happened with our unit and destroyed the improperly sealed circuit board.I have spoken with customer service and just like you might expect they assume everyone is stupid and try fixing the unit starting from the cheapest component. I have waited over a month for a power supply which I know will not fix the unit because I'm sure it was the urine.Just know you are taking a chance with this thing and for $329 you won't get much piece of mind if you have problems even though it comes with an 18 month BS warranty."
5,Litter Robot II,"Okay, well I used to have only one kitty and a regular cat box worked fine. However, last month I got a new kitten. I am very sensitive to the smells of litter box odors and change the kitty box everyday. When I got my new kitty, Peanut, I was changing twice a day, which was becoming VERY expensive. I've had the Litter Robot II now for a couple of weeks and I absolutely love it. I still empty the drawer out everyday bc like I said, I can't stand any type of litter box smell. I hardly go through any litter at all now and am saving money bc of it. I haven't experienced any problems with my cats not turning around and the urine going on the outside of the box. The only problem I've had is that my older cat likes to dig a deep hole and he tends to push the litter up and over the lip when he is digging. I can't recommend this product enough!!!!"
5,Best I've Seen,"I purchased the Litter Robot after our Purrforma kicked the bucket. After my kitties got used to the Litter Robot (it took about a week), I was able to appreciate how poorly the Purrfoma functioned (frequent jamming, expensive replacement parts such as bags, air filters, trays, etc.). The Litter Robot has performed flawlessly, aside from one instance where my curious cat tried to jump in while it was moving (this hasn't been a problem since). After one month, I have not had to buy any more litter, and have emptied the voluminous bin only 4 times (I had to empty the Purrforma at least once every two days). One hint - poor some baking soda in the bag in bin to absorb odor.Maybe it seems pricey, but if this box lasts three years, it will have been more than worth it."
5,Money well-spent,"I probably wouldn't have spent this much money on a litter box if I hadn't been able to see it in action at a friends house. Suddenly, what used to be the bane of my week (cleaning the litter box) is no big deal and only has to happen about once a month; and the daily scooping is no longer even an issue. My cats are happier, my cats are more clean, my apartment is more clean, I am happier. I am so happy that I bought this."
2,First Purchase was Great; Second Not Great At All,"I have purchased two Litter-robots in four years. The first lasted three years with two cats, so I felt it was well worth the purchase price and decided to buy a new unit when the old one died. $350 and one year later the electronic part of the machine died. Just had no power one day. I called the customer service number and left messages since no matter what time I called no human answered, but my calls have not been returned.I liked the product but spending even more money for a machine that only lasted a year seems like a foolish waste of money. This experience with the second litter-robot makes it hard for me to recommend the purchase."
4,Cat has bad aim?,"The product is a great idea, so I gave it four stars. However, I have a tiny cat (less than five pounds, not quite a year old), and she routinely gets poop & pee on the interior of the robot's globe. When the robot ""cycles,"" it smears poop all over the interior of the globe. Stinnky, stinky, STINKY!! When it's ready for the cat to use, the space where there is actually litter is less than one foot square; I don't see how a bigger, full-grown cat could aim itself any better? I have wasted lots of litter, due to needing to throw everything away, wash the globe, and start over. So far, quite a bit more hassle for something that was supposed to save me from lots of disgusting clean-up, let alone litter... I'm hoping my cat gets the hang of it!"
5,best $250 I've ever spent,"When first seeing the price of this item, I balked. Since it had a money back guarantee, I figured I had nothing to lose by trying. Turns out this is the best $250 I've ever spent. It does everything it says it is going to do. I have three cats, and instead of two old fashioned stinky litter boxes, I now just use the one litter robot. I clean it once per week. Wow! It took our cats about a week to fully transition. We left the old boxes next to it, as the manufactor recommends. Even our finicky, funny old rex cat came around, and I was worried she wouldn't. A little cat nip (provided) helped with that. This makes life so much easier and tidier, and I love hearing the sound of it come on automatically. I feel cleaner; the box is cleaner; the dogs can no longer raid the cat box for kitty-roca treats. By the way, I bought a reconditioned unit for less money. It has the same guarantee as a new one, so why not?Catherine"
5,Awesome product,"At first I wasn't sure if our cats would use this (we have 4). They have never had a covered box and this was way different than the Littermaid they were used to. It took a day or two for them to be comfortable with it but since it's so much cleaner than their old box, they use it more reliably than the other. The reviews for the Litter Robot are what sold me on it. Yes, the cost is alot more than the Littermaid but I've gone through 4 of them in the last 6 years so it's really cheaper in the long run. We used to have to empty the waste containers every day but with the Robot, we only empty twice a week! Our biggest kitty is almost 16 pounds and fairly 'plump' and she fits fine.The LRII is the best!"
2,"nice idea, but.....","I have owned a little robot for 3.5 months. It has not been the panacea that I had hoped for. I have 2 kitties. My newer one was refusing to use any litter box that had been used, so I got this for her. The robot had nice instructions for how to introduce cats to it, but she is still too skittish to use it. Fortunately, she has become more reasonable now in litter box habits anyway. My other kitty is 10.5 lbs. He will use it (reluctantly), but doesn't quite fit so gets poop on the outlet area. So, I think I should have saved my money. And wish that I could have foretold in the first 30 days as to whether they would use it. (I do not recommend the automatic ""raking"" kind, either, as I've had that twice and each time it broke within a year.)"
5,Awesome,"I love my litter robot. Although they are pretty pricey they are ment to last and they are totally worth it. One of my cats is incredibly fussy about the condition of her litter box and this contraption keeps her satisfied. my other cats could care less but they all took to it with little to no trouble (one of them took off running every time she used it and would sneak back to watch it work for about a year). Ive owned a refurbished one for 4 years and it finally broke on me, customer support (from the litter robot site) was extremely helpful even though my litter robot is way out of warranty. She helped me diagnose the problem and showed me that their web page ( [...] ) sells many of the individual parts so that you can switch out whatever is broken without having to replace the whole unit. My cats and I LOVE our litter robot <3"
4,"Great Product, Great Customer Service - Needs Design Improvement","Bought this product back in December '09 for our two 6 month old kittens. They took to it immediately and initially it worked without a hitch. After a few weeks it started having trouble finding the home position, sometimes dumping litter on the floor and often stopping upside down leaving no place for the kittens to ""go"".So, we called customer service and they quickly diagnosed the problem - the circuit board must have gotten wet. They shipped a replacement board immediately, it was easy to replace and now it's working like a charm again! It was great that they were able to resolve the issue so quickly however; it was also an indication of a known design flaw. The circuit board should be protected from the elements and certainly not placed where kitties can easily urinate on it accidentally.As others have said, the design could certainly be improved but, it's definitely worth the $$$ in the end!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"We have had this for about a month now and am just loving it. We had the litter mate before this and I hated how the rake would break up little pieces, so it was never totally clean in the litter box unless I scooped everything out once in awhile. With this one I have done nothing but fill it with litter and empty the bags. I had no problems with all three of my cats taking to this. We left out the old litter box, but they haven't used it once since we had this one. We did buy this from the actual litter robot website though. We got the reconditioned one since it was 75 dollars cheaper! The only thing I noticed was a black mark in the front and I couldn't tell it had been used. Over all I love this thing!"
2,Changed my mind from 5 stars to 2 stars!,When I first got this I thought it was great and I originally gave it 5 stars.UPDATE. I have had this almost a year and I don't like it that much. I now give it 2 stars. It is VERY messy and smelly. The cats kick litter out and litter catches in the small dumping doors and piles up on the floor on both sides. Sometimes a clump will get caught in the doors and the doors won't close. The inside gets nasty quickly and it is a pain to take apart and clean.I have recently bought 2 large litter boxes with doors and am using sifting liners in them. They are much less messy and smelly and it takes very little time to sift/scoop the boxes each day.
5,Great service,The Litter Robot arrived as scheduled and works as expected. i know that our two cats will enjoy it and I will enjoy not having a smelly box to clean out everyday.
1,Broke after a few months,"Can't wait to deal with customer service, they sound horrible...Sensor never worked, cats took some time to start using it. Even starting it manually though, it was great for a month there..."
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get this item after reading the other reviews. I was impressed when I did receive it, the quality is very good and it works great. I followed the directions exactly for getting my two cats used to this new box. However, ater two weeks of trying, they just refuse to use it and have found a corner to use instead....uggghhhh!!!!! I think it is just to small inside and they are not overly large cats nor are they timid in any way. Lots of money for something that should be more accomadating. So, very disappointed that this did not work for me. I hope you consider my experience before buying one."
5,Awesome-sauce!,"I now have to deal with litter only once a week. It's the most miraculous thing in the world, and takes care of both of our cats (although they are both very small). There's always a possibility your cat will hate it and go to the bathroom somewhere else, but then you can return it. And if they do use it without problem, you will be so excited because you can ignore the litter box like you used to EXCEPT NOW IT CLEANS ITSELF!"
1,Junk,"I had the problem of my cat not going all the way in and peeing down the outside front. This was smelly and a mess to clean up but I could live with it. What really upset me and turned me against this unit is that it only lasted 8 months. I bought a refurbished unit so there was no warranty after that long. For what this thing cost, even refurbished ($260.00), I expected years of service from it. I certainly wouldn't buy another refurbished unit and I am not willing to risk $300.00 for a new one. The rake type box I had before only cost around $100.00 and lasted 5 years. The rake box had to be cleaned more often but at least the cat didn't go on the outside of it. It also cost a third less and lasted more than 5 times longer."
4,good kitty,"I bought the litter robot lr11 to make it easier on my wifes bad back cuz I do not do litter box""s at all!!!After getting it,My wife was thrilled on how great it is.Three happy cats also.I then went and purchase 3 more for family presents.Two daughters each 3 cats and a brother in bad health 1 cat.Everybody LOVES the robot.Little less noise in the middle of night and I would even be in LOVE. I told you I don""t do litter box""s John from Coral Springs"
2,Cat pee smells!,"This machine basically does what it says, unfortunately, it is very small. I have a medium sized cat and she can barely fit in it. She has recently been forgetting(?) to turn around and is peeing right out onto the step. I think she may also be scared of the thing flipping around with her still in it. I had high hopes for the litter robot, but now I am upset I spent the $300. Maybe your luck will be different."
5,This is a great product!,"The Litter Robot obviously costs more than the bottom-of-the-line traditional litter box, but it is worth every cent not to have a daily ""treasure hunt"". This device sits in our laundry room which is located in the middle of our house, and there is very little (if any) smell that comes from the box (as long as you empty the box at least twice a week for a single cat household). We have a new kitten, and it took to using the Litter Box the very first day, and there have been no accidents so far. The kitten is not 5 lbs yet (which is the lower limit to activate the mechanism- although there is a sensitivity switch which is still not enough to make it work), but this is not an issue. I just see if the litter is disturbed. If it is, then I just press the button with my foot to activate it. How easy! Thanks for a great product!"
1,Lousy - better off spending the extra $ to be sure.,Half of the tests didn't work: the reference line that is supposed to show up so that you know the test is working - wasn't there!
2,Almost good,"I have enjoyed David Leddick's photo books in the past and thought that this would be a nice addition to my collection. While I am glad that I own the book for its historical significance and the chance to learn a bit more about some of the models I have seen in the past, the book left me wanting more. There are not enough photos and not enough info on these or other models. For a person interested in completing a collection of male nude photos this book is useful. For the casual collector and admirer the price is too dear and the content too slight."
5,great book!,This book is great.. as an artist I was just thrilled with this book. The history behind the models was insightful and captivating. A must read if you want to shoot figure models.
2,Quality is not good,The image from the dvd is horrible and the sound is really bad I don't recommend it sorry but the dvd is not professional
1,BOOTLEG QUALITY!,"Home made dvd! No menu, no packaging inserts, the DVD I got even had light scratches on it right out the box! I can make a better looking dvd at home myself! TO top it all off PIXELATED looking video and Dolby what? they had the nerve to put Dolby Digital when you are lucky it has stereo sound! So mad about this purchase..Amazon should be ashamed to sell this under their name!"
1,Bootleg,"Poor visual quality and sound, AMAZON, you can not allow items like this to sell. This is not EBAY."
1,"Bad Image quality, Bad Audio!!!","Do not buy, it looks like a home made video, bad video quality and bad audio quality. The video editing and audio is like a home made."
1,Don't purchase!,"Amazon should not sell this particular concert video.It looks like a bootleg copy. Video production and sound are horrible.Video looks hazy. In these days of blu ray dvds, this video is almost un-watchable.Thank you."
1,Very Disappointed,"In general bad quality. It seems that has been recorded from a copy.I can't hear the music even with the volume at the maximum. The visual part is mediocre, non effects, but the audio is the worst part."
4,The rest of the Delmark material,"These are the out-takes from three sessions that Delmark records had the rights to. The first two tracks are material cut by Shakey Jake and Bob Lindeman for a record label that never came to fruition.Tracks 3 to 6 have backing tracks from a three piece band, with Shakey Jake adding harmonica, whilst tracks 7 to 13 have Eddie Shaw on Tenor Sax and Lafayette Leake on piano. In between there is both studio banter and track clicks.The quality of the recordings is excellent, though frankly buying ""West Side Soul"" or ""Black Magic"" are a better places to start piecing together the recorded legacy of a man who was never to realise his full potential. As a ""I wonder what would have happened"" aside, Magic Sam was on his way to Stax records from Delmark for his next proposed recording session......"
1,Range Kleen Sticks and Stinks,"Ditto to the first review.Eggs stick and I have ""seasoned it"" countless times. Still trying to figure out what they want me to do so it won't stick with eggs.It does heat water OK. LOL"
2,Standard Cast Iron Cookware,"From the research I had done, I expected this pan to have a special interior that would be easy to clean, unlike typical cast iron cookware. The interior is like sandpaper like any other cast iron cookware - it's a royal pain to clean.Also I had the impression the handle would not heat up significantly. Not true, after cooking the pan can only be comfortably (heat wise) lifted from the very end of the handle and that is creating a lot of bad leverage against the heavy weight of the pan making it dangerous and difficult to hold while you empty the contents."
3,A quick but informative read,"Apparently there is a lot more to home business than meets the eye. Lillian Vernon's story illustrates the challenges and exhilarations she faced juggling her business, personal and family relationships. This book is a good overview of a personal success story, from the point of view of a woman who was only looking to earn a little extra cash and instead amassed an empire."
3,Mediocre imitation of The Day of the Jackal.,"The Algonquin Project by Frederick Nolan is the story of an ill conceived plan to assassinate General George S. Patton (referred to in this book as General George R. Campion). Like Frederick Forsyth's classic international thriller The Day of the Jackal, it involves a steely eyed lone assassin who methodically stalks his prey as he is pursued by authorities working with only the sketchiest of information.Unlike The Day of the Jackal, from which it steals shamelessly, The Algonquin Project lacks a cohesive narrative, fails to build much in the way of suspense, relies heavily on transparent gimmicks and is completely noncredible.In short, this is a copycat novel which fails to come anywhere near the quality of the masterwork it attempts to imitate. Not recommended."
4,100 smokers beware,"Too funny. This thing works great with normal cigarettes, however it will make potpourri out of 100's. I recommend it to make any smoker laugh."
3,Poor pucture quality.,"I'm actually a fan of ""NUMBER 17"", I like Hitchcock's use of light & shadow to create the mood. Yes it is a little slow & stagey, but I get engrosed by the visuals.And there lies the problem with this Laserlight/Delta DVD. The picture quality is horrible, full of digital artifacting that makes the picture appear to freeze in sections then play again. The details get lost in the pixilation. How can you enjoy a visually engrosing movie if it looks terrible.I have an old Japanese Laserdisc of this movie, and it looks much better!Japanese videos are NTSC format, so they will play on U.S. televisions. I would rather watch the Japanese Laserdisc with Japanese subtitles on screen that this awful Laserlight/Delta DVD.And about ""THE RING"", Studio Canal / Lionsgate has released a nice 35mm mastered copy in a DVD box set: Alfred Hitchcock, The Early Years of the Master."
5,"Vandoren Optimum clarinet Ligature, Bb Clarinet w/Plastic Cap.","Great Bb Clarinet ligature, easy to adjust the reed with one try. The sound is great all around. I am very happy with it. It also sounds louder as the P.A systems tend to cover a clarinet. This is not a cheap ligature, but it is very good responds, tone, and best of all a better sound. I added this Ligature to my Selmer Bb Recital clarinet, and I am very please with my set-up to a Vandoren B45 mouthpiece. I play Comp. Christian Music, and want the best for the Lord. (Blues, Oldies of the 50's) If you buy it you will not be sorry.. (60 years playing off, and on) The Rev."
4,A good value clarinet mouthpiece,This is a good replacement for the old clarinet mouthpiece. The way the ligature holds on with just one screw is convenient.
5,Ride over borkin glass,Ever sence ive gotten these liners ive been a happy man.. let just say 1st off i live in a area thats got alot of brokin glass out side. & sence i bike my self to work my tiers get blown out like every 5 to 6 months.. sence ive bought these liners i havent had a blowout yet!. my tires got at least 3 to 4 glass cuts in em and im still rolling.. this is a very grate buy!!
3,pleasant to look at,"I was looking for something relaxing for our new 50 inch HD TV and I decided to give this DVD a try. First, what I liked about the DVD is that there are 5 different fish tank environments to view and each one will play continously when selected. Also there is a slideshow which was my favorite part. The picture quality is good and there is a wide variety of fish in the slideshow. The soundtrack is very relaxing as well. What I wished was better: The fish tanks are good but not great picture quality. You also see only a small area of the tank instead of looking at a traditional large tropical fish tank. However, what you do see looks good. I do wish they had added more saltwater scenes and coral reefs. I think 4 of the 5 aquariums here are freshwater. All in all a decent, but not great buy."
3,Not bad for prize,"The DVD has different options. When on, for a long time about 60 min it becomes a little boring the music does not change! but one of the cheapest. It does the trick!"
1,a waste of money,"Only three pages of this tome are devoted to Fibronacci numbers, and none of these is remotely related to market analysis. The rest of the pamphlet contains an impenetrable discussion of Elliot Wave mumbo-jumbo."
4,Basic Guitar Book,"The book was delivered in a timely manner. It was a simplified edition as stated. However, I was a disappointed in how outdated all the songs in the book were."
4,I really like these!,"I know that these are intended to set the scene for theme parties, but I bought this to use as a back drop for a display at the small retail store that I work at. It came out looking really cool, and very inexpensive considering I have enough left over to make at least two more displays. Much better than paying for a custom wall mural! It was also very easy to hang. I plan on purchasing one of the beach scenes for a display I will be creating for summer. Although there are lots of different back drops to choose from for birthdays and holidays, I'm hoping that they will continue expanding their themes. Jungle theme PLEEEASE!!!"
3,A Little too Much,Too many characters and a little hard to believe. It's fun to watch but she is much better in Good Wife
5,Very good and,"Firstly i was meaning to buy Traffic - the miniseries, but i confused traffic for the grid. I don't watch any shows like this (24, alias etc), and i had no expectations of it. The first half hour or so starts off slow and admitedbly boring, but when it get into the pace of things it's very interesting. It's clever, and the action is realistic (Far from Jame's bond style). It's veyr exciting and goes for over 4 hours, so that was fun aswell (And can manage to sustain interest for that ammount of time, which is a good sign). And the ending isn't that bad, there just one final bit at the end that suggests a countinue. So the ending isn't actually bad, it's very good. Just there's that extra bit, which they may make a Grid 2. Very good"
3,"Not great, but an interesting start to a series","This book starts slowly. Stick with it, and it gradually develops into an interesting tale set in Colonial America. The characters at times seem a bit too perfect, but the author showed the good sense to show flaws in their personalities and behavior. It was good enough that, after finishing it, I was looking forward to reading Book Two, ""The Great Deception."""
1,"Poor quality, poor fit",OEM radiator cap would not fit on. Pipe fittings for transmission lines were very poor quality. Did not mount/line up properly with original fittings.
3,Stay away from digital versions of a book like this,"Bought the digital version - big mistake. As far as I can tell (and I haven't really bothered to look for a workaround), the pdf will only work/open on the computer which you downloaded your new e-book from; you can't copy/burn it to put it on another computer or to share your new pdf-book with your friends like you could if you actually bought the hard copy. Buy hard copies only! (Another blow for the bloated pdf format...)"
5,A good place to start!,"If your a UNIX virgin, (and I was!) this is a good working companion to practice your skills and achieve a better grasp of the UNIX command line utilities and tools. It has a good structured approach to working with the systems from day one. Don't try to blow through it. Do the reading and the practices and you'll get a better understanding of the systems."
4,Great Intro to Unix or Linux!,This was a great introduction to Unix systems. I originnally purchased this book for my Linux system and it was great. At first I was not to sure about the 24hr books (they have a bad reputation) but this book is not one of them! From beginning to end it flawlessly covers everything in Unix )or Linux) you need to know to actually get working within 24hrs.
5,"starts with the basics, with room to grow","I didn't really have much experience with unix before I got this book (although I had dabbled a little), and this book was a good introduction and contained enough depth for me to grow. A problem I find with many books is that the 'introduction' type books are often too basic (even if I do learn from them, they don't offer enough beyond the most basic stuff, and I end up knowing 'recipes' for doing specific things, more than a working knowledge of a given subject) and the more advanced ones often assume too much background knowledge, making it frustrating and slow to read. This one, however, was a good balance of introductory overview and detailed description that I could learn something with solid depth, and when I got used to it I could go back and reread the more advanced details. Even for beginners, I think this book is easy enough to learn the basics and offers a lot of room to grow as your experience improves."
5,Excellent for Unix newbies!,"Covers all basic and intermediate Unix commands, an explanation on what Unix is, where it originated from and how to find your way around using it. Also covers handy programs such as the VI editor and how to communicate with remote users on remote machines. This book covers enough to keep you busy for a couple of months, and is an excellent reference to have at hand."
3,Painful Read,"I found this book to be a painful read. In many places, the author presents data in an implicit fashion, couched in a workflow that leaves you wondering why you're doing what you're doing. This makes it of little value as a reference, and unnecessarily compromises its value as a teaching device. Doing exercises where the goal is not apparrent either before or after you are done is a poor use of time.Only a few of the examples are downloadable.Not all examples work as described."
2,Somewhat confusing,"Contrary to the other reviews, I found this book to be not that excellent for unix newbies. Although ok at the start, it doesn't explain some unix commands properly; I sometimes get the feeling the author thinks it is so obvious that he doesn't need to explain it. The parts for scripts and shell programming leave alot to be desired, and the end chapters on networking and internet in general are bit out of place in an unix book. Overall, not a great book for newbies or experienced unix users."
3,Incomplete and Not Well Organized,"I think this book has most of the information in it you need when you start out, however the way it is organized was not to my liking. I would have liked to have seen it with just a little bit more reference material. Some lists of all the options for this or that command, etc.I do admit though that the permisssions chapter had some great examples. All the chapters have examples."
3,Mistakes and Typos are a down fall,"A good book for a beginner, but it falls way short for someone who has any operating experience at all.I was suprised that it did not go into the actual UNIX file structure, (i.e. inodes, superblocks, etc). Anyone who has worked with DOS would get better information from a UNIX System V primer that a this book.Last thought: Get UNIX in a Nutshell."
3,For newbies only,This book is VERY basic. This is definately not the book you want if you are already somewhat familiar with Unix. This book is geared more towards someone that has never even logged in to a Unix box.
4,Good intro but not the best,"This book gives you an intro about the wonderfully world of Unix. The book assumes that you already have installed some sort of Unix, let it be BSD, Linux, Version 7, or any other flavor, so it really does not cover how to install Unix; since that would differ from one flavor to the next. There are many issues that troubled me with the book. The first is the title, which could be deceiving. The second are the chapters, I believe that the author could have put allot more topics but did not because he was limited by the constraint of the title and the period it would take to read it. The last is the formatting of the book which was somewhat confusing, the output or the input was sometimes unclear and some of the topics where not really explained as they should have been."
5,Now I am going to purchase it!,"I have just downloaded your Studio Line, version 1.3, and the Photo freeware and I am amazed at the work you have put into this! I can hardly wait to get started."
5,Healing through Insight,"My mother-who came to know this author through her writing on adoption-brought this book to me soon after the death of my precious, only daughter.The poetic way this author portrays buried grief and gently reveals the power of the greatest force,of the most hallowed relationship-that between a mother and her child-gave me great insight and a feeling of peace.I feel this book catapulted me into a much deeper place in myunderstanding of this process of grieving.I believe any mother would gain insight from this reading as would any daughter.I especially recommend this reading to any woman who has sufferedthe most excrutiating loss--that of her child."
2,Great idea ... But illegal in some states,"We really like this tag frame. It makes an important statement regarding cycling. However, the bottom of the frame covers up an important part of tags in certain states (on the FL Tag it covers up the County which must be properly displayed). This is disappointing as it is unusable on the rear of the vehicle where it has the greatest impact."
1,Flaky Flash,"I wanted to replace my portable traditional hard drive with a flash drive. This one performed poorly - I often got messages saying to ""insert next drive"". It was also horribly slow - much slower than a portable USB hard drive. It also didn't work in a Phillips DVD player equipped with a USB port."
1,Broke in less than 1 week,I am an art student and I needed a flash drive that could hold lots of large image files. I already had several 2GB and 4GB drives but I wanted a drive that could hold more. I chose this one because the red color would differentiate it from my other drives. I had had the thing for just over 1 WEEK before it broke. It was plugged into the computer when I bumped the protruding plastic shell. I did not hit it hard but it bent really badly. Now it doesn't even show up when I try plugging it in to any computer. I have had some of my other flash drives for years and they still work fine even after sustaining similar damage. I would go for a drive with sturdier construction.
2,Fast but not sturdy,"This is a pretty fast USB flash drive. I ran portable apps on it and email, browser, picture viewer and dontknowwhat all ran nicely smooth. The sliding mechanism wasn't too great because when inserting the stick into a rather tight port the locking mechanism would often fail and the plug would slide back into the drive.The really bad though is that the whole thing is broken now. I had it once in the side of my laptop and when I put the laptop on a chair with a soft cushion (that made it sinking into the cushion) the drive bent really badly. I bent it back as careful as possible but the rescue attempt was useless. The drive was broken. There really wasn't a lot of pressure applying to the drive when I put that laptop down...I am pretty disappointed."
1,Not as advertised,"Product FeaturesCapacity: 64 GBGo USB drive makes transporting and sharing files simple and convenient without a CD, DVD or Floppy Disk driveEnhanced for Windows ReadyBoostCertified for Windows VistaRetractable USB Connector - No cap to loseSecurity feature to protect sensitive dataCompatible with Windows 7 and VistaLimited lifetime warrantyPassword security feature protects sensitive data with a privacy zone (Windows operating systems only)Retractable USB connector means no cap to losestates is Enhanced for Windows ReadyBoost. Reason why I purchased this item. Original start at plug in as if you want to use for ReadyBoost, but when you go to the ReadyBoost panel it fails the test. Retested several times and a no go."
2,Slow,"Bought this yesterday, and it's slow...took at least two hours to record 3.5 gigabytes of material. I found the Corsair drive to be much faster."
5,Great product - definitely worth it!,I used this in my new Honda Fit to play all of my mp3's. Works great and the readyboost really improves the transfer speed when moving files to the drive. This has more storage space than my laptop's entire hard drive. Perfect for storage backup or mobile data travel.
1,Apparently does NOT support Windows 7 ReadyBoost,"I bought this to replace two 16GB USB flash drives I was using for Windows 7 ReadyBoost. When I plugged the drive in, Windows 7 recognized it. I went to set it up for ReadyBoost and Windows said it did not meet the minimum specs for ReadyBoost! So for what I purchased the drive for, it's useless. It's still a huge USB drive, but not fit for what I purchased it for. I e-mailed Verbatim to complain since they advertise that it works with Windows 7 ReadyBoost, but have not heard from them yet."
1,Saty away from this junk!,"I bought this two weeks ago at Staples for the great price fo $40. It worked well for about a week. I had several large files on the drive, and had enough room to save another one before it was full. I kept getting the disk full message. I safely took it out of one computer, and tried opening files on another one, when it simply read that the unit had no files. Stay away from this brand, unless you wish to lose your data."
1,They have a problem with the 32gb drives,I have many Verbatim flash drives and they all still work wonderfullywithout a hitch. I recently bought 4 32gb drives and they are havegradually failed. Verbatim emailed new drivers but they don't workeither. My two year old 16gb is still rocking along. I believe theyhad a bad run or something. Will now battle it out with customer sservice.
1,Bad out of the package,"We purchased two of these for data backups, the first we opened was bad right out of the package.The second drive seemed to work fine for backups until we tried to copy the data from it back to the computer. The drive got really hot and then disappeared from my computerThats when we found out that the controller was bad. When I called verbatim about it, they apologized and gave me the name of a company that for 2700 dollars could get my data back.Don't buy this drive, get the SanDisk, OCZ or the Kingston. I have several of those drives and never had a problem."
1,Drive failed during a presentation,The drive felt cheap and poorly made. It worked fine for 40 days and then on insertion for the big presentation it could not be read by any computer and was completely unusable. We could not get the proprietary info off the drive and so could not return it. What a pices of junk!
1,Try something else,"This flash drive worked for about one day. Then I could no long read or write to it. When I would try to delete a file, it would look like it deletes and then would still be there on refresh. Similar bad behavior on two PCs and a Mac. I should have looked at reviews first."
3,"Not as good as 4,8, and 16 GB units","I have the same brand of this product in 4, 8, and 16GB. Those units are fast to copy to and also have a blue flashing light when in use. This unit doesn't have the flashing light. Not sure if it's supposed to but I expected it given the prior history. Copying files to the 32GB device is perceivably slower than older ones. Copying files from the device to a PC is about the same. I am glad to have the extra space but am disappointed overall in the performance."
1,Didn't make it through first write,"This flash drive quit working the first time I attempted to write data to it. It also would not format using Windows, or any third party software I tried. No LED to tell when data is being written or read. Three words: Made In China.I ended up returning this drive and buying the HP 32GB flash drive and have had no problems with it. (The HP drive was NOT made in China.) It was a few dollars more, but worth it."
2,Not impressed,"Apparently, Verbatim used to make ""Store 'n' Go"" model flash drives that had solid cases, an on light, and fast write times. But the current version of this model has a very flimsy case, no on light, and very slow write times. It was tedious to upload mp3's onto this unit. Then after two days of lightly using it with my car's sound system, the flash drive failed completely. There are definitely better and cheaper flash drives out there."
1,Password Protection Useless,"A huge amount of memory for the price. Pretty slow, but no big deal. What IS a BIG deal is the poor information provided in the Amazon blurb, and on the Verbatim company website, concerning the password protection. This is the only reason why I purchased the drive (actually two of them). The package has the ""Password Protection"" claim, and just two inches away is the Mac logo. All information provided states the drive is Mac compat. But, only after opening the package and using the drive, I learned that the password protection is good only for Windows systems. A nasty bait-and-switch. I would not have purchased these drives if the necessary information had been provided. There are faster drives for the money, so Verbatim is now on my curse list. The time and expense of trying to return the drives is just not worth the effort, so I will give them away to friends who use Windows systems."
2,broken flash drive,"Had this product for a couple months and it worked fine, upgraded from the 4gb version when I needed more space. The old one was a year old and already it was malfunctioning, the slider got jammed constantly and you could hear something rattling around inside of it. This new flash drive I got died on me today, it became unreadable to all of my computers and I tried different ports as well. It contained about 8gb of work, I left it plugged into my computer and it was fine until I checked it today, now my essay and game files are gone forever. Thanks a lot Verbatim, Won't be going near your products anytime soon!"
4,Simple thin thumb drive,I like the thinness - fits most spaces and computers. Red color is a little jarring. I have not tried password protection. Works great with Macs and PCs.
1,Cheap plastic,"I haven't encountered any issues with data saved to this device, but I do have a problem with the cheap plastic construction. When I try to insert this device into either of my laptops, the stop isn't strong enough to prevent the drive from retracting back into the casing. I basically have to hold the slide in place with a key while I plug in the drive - this isn't just a case of a tight port, every port I've tried this drive in causes it to retract. I guess you get what you pay for, and this was pretty inexpensive, but I expected more from a name brand."
4,Verbatim 8 GB thumb drive,"This product works fine, as advertised, and is very fast. I have no complaints on it at this time."
1,Breaks waaaay to easy for a day-to-day device,"Similar to another user, I made the mistake of bumping the flash drive while it was in the computer. It hit a pillow, so the damage shouldn't have been too bad, but the flash drive completely bent in half. Now it has no power and my computer won't recognize it. Have used different brands of flash drives for years (every day use) and never had a problem. Do not buy until they can design a sturdier product."
4,Great Value but only Good Quality,"I have purchased about 10 of these drives in the last 2 years for our office.Data saves fine, no problems, easy to use.However, I have had my last one bend significantly at the point where you slide the USB connection out from the plastic casing. The drive still works, but it is bent and has a harder time going in and out of the slots.Overall though, great product. Like I said, only 1 out of 10 has had this problem."
5,Great Flash Drive,"Always works. Bright red so you can find the little bugger in a drawer, or peeking out from under some paperwork."
3,Little,"The stones sparkle,it looks good,but it's very delicate,maybe a larger size of thenecklace was better"
3,Necklace does not lay flat -returned,Good quality and very pretty. Perhaps if you have a very skinny neck this will lay flat.
5,Happy Hips Duck Breast is a great treat,"After finding these at Target, I bought some for my dogs. They absolutely love them! At $6.79 per bag, though, they were really expensive. I tried to find them cheaper and have succeeded. Even though there is no 'free shipping', the price makes up for it if you buy a bunch of them. I bought 10 bags and came out better than if I had bought them at Target."
3,"Not the best ""How To"" Book","Given to me by a friend when I just discovered watercoloring, I had high hopes for this book. It's nice to leaf through, with a wide range of beautiful color plates that can be the source of inspiration. But its ""step-by-step"" descriptions of various techniques are frustratingly unclear.I'm on the hunt for another."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"""The Complete Guide to Watercolor"" is in the library of the school in which I work. Therefore I was familiar with the book. It is excellent in contents and the condition is also excellent. Thank you."
3,It's alright,"I'm an artist who is very fluent in other mediums. I paint with oils, acrylics, and I draw with various dry media. Watercolour was something I'd not yet tried and as I intend to soon (I'm waiting on my order of paints to arrive) I picked up this book in the hopes that I would learn a lot.The information is laid out well and broken down into easily navigatable categories. It has full colour pictures throughout which is helpful (and often lacking) in art related books.The main down side I noticed with this book is that it doesn't go in depth as far as technique is concerned. Yes, it does teach you how to do certain things, but I felt like I was missing some important information and when I finished the book, I did not feel confident that I'd know what to do if all the materials were in front of me."
2,More or less a rehash of old material,"Except for an interesting chapter about the Catholic upbringing of his early life, it seemed like Mr. Buckley simply went to his file cabinet and strung together a series of loosely related items. You don't get the sense of a profoundly intimate spiritual autobiography."
2,"no depth, no true charity, just catechism rehashed","I left the Catholic Church a few years ago just because of the rules about papal infallibility, contraception - not the rules as such but their complete overshadowing of personal responsibility of each of us and their lack of charity.In a way, Mr. Buckley's book is reassuring. If that is what Catholicism is, the correctness of my decision to leave is reaffirmed for me. And goodness, the argument that something is good (the centralistic One Church of Catholicism) because it has been around for a long time - I was astonished to see that this argument still is printable in a serious book!I give the book a 2 because it is nicely written but don't expect anything that really inspires or breaks new ground in here."
3,Not as good as the usual WFB fare,"I am unabashadly conservative, and a big WFB fan. I was curious to read this book and understand a bit better the connection of his faith to his work & life, but came away a bit disappointed. There was very little in the way of WFB sharing any sort of personal relationship with God, and perhaps that is telling. Instead, there was a lot of story retelling about his experience in Catholic school along with some long recited passages from other authors/catholic writers that influenced him. Some may enjoy this approach, it was just - for me - disapointing compared to the high bar set by his other works."
3,"mixed emotions, but must-read for Buckley fans","Like the reader before (""No Nearer My God""), I was a bit disappointed that Mr. Buckley failed to come down on one side or the other on the tough issues. I assume that either he has, and did not want to share it, or that he has not yet. If the latter, it is disheartening to think that the single most important issue in the life of a Catholic, that of accepting or rejecting the authority of the Church in matters of faith and morals, has not been definitively reached yet by such a learned figure. If that point has been reached, then contraception and priestly celibacy are non-issues."
5,Quartet Grease Board Review,Board is heavy duty and meets the needs of an outside environment...xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx
3,Arrived with scratch/dent,"Unfortunately, this product arrived with a 4 inch scratch/dent in the left upper quadrant. It is good size, and does stand well, although on a wood floor the small feet could scratch. As for dry-erase quality, the board left shadows almost immediately. I tried various colors, and the same result with all. It should serve it's purpose for our family, but I am disappointed it arrived damaged."
1,erase easel not good as it look,"This products has been returned two times with damages that came with. When we wrote on it, there were left a mark and doesn't go with the erase liquid."
3,"Basic easel, awkward set-up","I frequently use flip-chart easels in my work and tried this unit, mainly for its reasonable price. The writing surface is solid and the legs steady. It is a bit heavy to carry, but certainly suitable for meeting rooms. The big complaint is the difficulty in opening and retracting the legs. When closed the legs are secured by a locking button. This button in turn needs to be fully depressed to open the legs. The problem is that it is almost impossible to do without turning the easel on its side (which requires removing the paper). The whole operation takes a few minutes and does not leave you feeling particularly professional. Three stars for the stable work surface, lose two stars for the hassle factor."
1,Broken,I have set this easel up only 5 times and it is broken already! The third leg ripped off the back due to poor design. Unfortunately it is past the return date and I cannot even exchange it.
3,The best of Red Green video,The video arrived quickly and in good shape.We were a little disappointed with the video. It was not as funny as Red's other videos; not as much duck tape humor.
2,The Best of Red Green,"I didn't feel this VHS tape is the best of Red Green. Whomever picked out the scenes, did not do a very good job. Though the tape was made in 1995, there were many more shows after that. They need to make a tape called ""The Best of the Best of Red Green"" and look through ALL his shows. This tape is a disappointment. I have seen much better scenes than the majority of the ones picked out for this tape."
3,Something that only men would enjoy,"Contains clips from the weekly series arranged in a loose story format. It is nice to have the video available whenever I want to enjoy redneck/backwoods humor that is funny most of the time. Everything that Red does backfires, and Harold is there to point it out. The comments by Steve Smith at the end were very good for his views on the character development of Red and the boys."
2,Wasn't as good as most Clancy Thrillers!,"This book was a terrible book. The content was pretty boring at most times. This was nothing like the Sum of All Fears, or Patriot Games. I only liked brief parts of it. Hey Tom! Pick up the pace!"
1,Unimpressive use of a novel idea,"As a person involved in the biotech area, I was excited to pick up a thriller novel with a DNA helix on the cover at my local bookstore. Several days later, I felt unfulfilled and empty after having read the novel.The author took what could have been an exciting and suspense filled premise and turned it into an adolescent attempt at documenting the actions of living G.I. Joe figures."
1,BO-RING!,"Wow, this is by far the most BORING ""thriller"" I have ever picked up. It starts out pretty good, but then gets bogged down in several boring and confusing sub-plots. Even the writing style is dreadful -- I kept reading hoping it would pick up and it never really did. This book is a DOG, don't waste your time with it. Tom Clancy did not write this book - I am surprised he would endorse such a lame novel with his name."
3,Mayhem in the cold!,"This is an interesting story of action, adventure and mayhem on the cold and lonely Antarctic continent. The tale begins with the disappearance of an experimental Mars rover and its research team. The narrative then takes the reader around the world as we try to find out who and what is behind this drama. Who lives and who dies, and will come out on top, is a question everyone is struggling to find out. So, put on a warm coat, grab your gun and hope that the weather does not kill you before the bad guys get to you..."
2,Worst Clancy Book,"By no means did I enjoy this book and I have been reading Tom Clancy since I was 11 years old. (am i dating myself?? *grin*) I thought that I was buying a Tom Clancy novel but this book was not by him and I am rather upset. It was a waste of money, nothing like his other books and very very boring. I had to give up halfway through because I got so bored with it."
1,Horribly written!!!,"I have read lots of Clancy's early books and enjoyed them. This one is an absolute waste of a good plot. The author is NOT Clancy, but one of his ""group of authors"". He must still be in high school based on his writing and lack of ability to even structure sentences that make sense.The last Clancy book I will ever buy!!!!"
2,May have been good as a short story,"Most of what is written in this book exists for no apparent reason. The characters are all poorly developed, many are just cliches, so you never really care what happens to any of them. There are countless characters and conflicts that appear, and are never mentioned again. All you really know about the villains is that they are ruthless, cold-blooded killers. You never really have any reason to fear them.The story goes like this... The villains develop a deadly bio-engineered virus. They plan to make a fortune by selling it to other villains. They also use it to infect the head of a multi-national technology firm. He just happens to be a kind, caring man from a working class background. Now his elite, world-wide private security force, known as Sword (what is this, Get Smart?) must track down the villains before their beloved leader, and perhaps the whole world, is doomed. Guess how it ends."
1,Dont read,"having been living in the ghetto with a chesse hat and meat helmet i discover that god is really not tom clancy in fact tom clancy is the devil, this book is evil and full of racism,even though it smells like shaun king it is bad.Dpont read.What are u soing at my age reading u should be playing checkers or shuffleboard and the number 1 sort xfl"
5,An excellent book,"This book was simply awesome, Tom Clancy did it again. A beautiful idea with the the virus unleashed on the head of Uplink Technologies and how ricci and the rest of the team find the vaccine to save not only Roger Gordian but everyone else who has inherited the virus. a real page turner. Honestly I enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes Tom Clancy novels."
2,Nothing Special Here,"In my opinion, this book suffered somewhat from a lack of interesting characters. The plot was choppy and loose, coming together at the end for a mediocre finale. The villians were lackluster at best and far less compelling than those of other books affiliated with the Clancy name. The most interesting character to me in the book was the cunning freelance agent, Lathrop, who managed to pit rival drug lords against one another and benefit in the process. But the story wasn't really about him and it grew increasingly dull in the middle. I can't really recommend this book as anything special."
2,Not very coherent,"This story seems to jump from topic to topic without any real coherence. When the end finally came I was so lost, I didnt even realize it was coming. Not worth buying."
2,Can't believe this has averaged 4 stars!,"This is without a doubt the worst Clancy book I have read. I bought Bio-Strike because I loved his previous Power Plays work, Shadow Watch. This book was slow getting set up. I felt this took up at least half the book. It finally got pretty interesting, but then Clancy hung the ending. I don't mean he left it open to an interesting sequel; there was no closure to this story, and I don't look forward to reading a continuation of it."
4,comprehensive,"Blanchard's book is about a whole counterculture, not usually suspected of flourishing in the last decades of the 20th century in the America of Carnegie and Bryan. Blanchard not only proves beyond doubt that it was there, like the contemporary movements in England and France, but also that it was rich, embracing all the arts, both sexes, and every expression of gender, not to mention fashion, popular culture and arts usually labelled ""domestic."" Designed with an equally rich iconography, its text laid out together with contemporary pictures, ""Oscar Wilde's America"" is a model of cultural and intellectual history -- which might confuse poststructuralists and anti-poststructuralists alike."
5,Great rare CD,Can't find a lot of the songs in this CD for legal download on the internet. There's nothing else to say!
1,FROM LOVE FIELD-FINAL HOURS W/JFK,THIS IS A VERY DISAPPOINTING BOOK - IT COULD HAVE SERVED ITSELF BETTER AS A MAGAZINE ARTICLE - THERE IS TOO MUCH REHASHING OF OLD INFORMATION AND WHAT'S KNEW IS SLIGHT.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET IT OUT OF YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY.
3,Surprisingly literate,"This movie has a surprisingly literate and witty screenplay, with learned homages to ancient myth and history, and the acting by the three leads is quite strong (Forest as the Olympic wrestler-turned-warrior with a conscience, Morris as the wryly seductive leading lady, and especially Wolff as the scheming tyrant, who plays the role as if he were a charismatic young hoodlum in a 1960s biker movie, with fascinating results). Unfortunately, director Roger Corman was supposed to have 500 Greek soldiers for battle scenes, but only 50 showed up, so the epic ambitions of the movie were subverted by circumstances. Too bad! It's also unfortunate that the dvd crops the widescreen print down to full-screen. But the script and the performances remain, to be appreciated by any viewer with a love of the ancient world and a bit of imagination."
1,Beware!,This is quite possibly the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen. Totally unwatchable. Do buy it no matter how cheap the price. You are throwing your money away.
5,Rev A Shelf waste bin,"Fantastic! I installed this myself. The lid that was recommended for this item would not have worked as stated in previous reviews. I made sure to order the lid from the same company name that is on the waste basket. I think I orderd the lid from Get Organized. The lid fits perfectly with the waste basket. One of the best investments I have made in a long time. Love this! It fits under the sink of a standard kitchen cabinet with no problem. Downside, you have to purchase the door brackets and lid separately but it was worth it."
4,Good,"Nice Book, Full color pictures. Is not PORN, guys getting naked for a good cause. very artistic. Is a big book, very educative."
2,Naked and ugly,"Rankin's may focus his camera on naked men in this new book, but he doesn't find any beauty there. Known primarily for his mysogynist nudes of women, and his magazine work in trendoid cocaine frenzied Brit lifestyle mags, here he shows us that he hates men as well! While I wasn't expecting the glorious celebration of male beauty expressed by someone like Bruce Weber, it likewise carries none of the playful glamour of Mario Testino or testostrone fueled passion of Steven Klein. Skip this book and pick up instead this season's best new book of male studies, the monograph on Brazilian genius Alair Gomes."
5,Astonishingly hilariouse,"I believe that this book, ""How to be an international man of mystery"" is the most outrageouse piece of writting that I have ever read, in my entire life."
5,Gorgeous photos well presented,"The team of Carl Sams and his wife Jean Stoick is known for their breath-taking books for children. Here we see some of the images from those books along with other wildlife photos.Missing here are the composite images used in the story books, which of course are more appropriate there. I would love to see another book showing how they did those though. I think their work is quite marvelous. They spend a lot of time in the woods getting to know the animals with a resulting intimacy that makes the animals look almost like family members. At the same time they have expert technique and use light beautifully.The quality of the printing is high and the layout pleasing. Very well done!"
3,Beautiful Design - - Noteworthy pictures,"Although one may question if these images are ""wild"", the layout and quality of this book will be difficult to beat. It is apparent that the publisher has assembled a first class book with the highest quality photographs to be found. If you are looking for true, unmanipulated wildlife photography, there may be better choices. However if a colorful coffee table book with lots of stories is what you are after, this is the book for you."
1,Don't buy these tubes,I tried to install on of these tubes on my new bike tires and it exploded when I was filling it up with air. Do not buy these tubes as they are super sensitive and really shouldn't be on the market. I wish I could return both of them but the shipping would probably cost me more than what they're worth. Very disappointed.
1,Garbage.,"Size was off, I bought two and both were busted and in the trash within 1 hour. Waste of my f***king money. Bike rider 28 years. Worse tubes ever."
2,not what it claims to be,"Just got 2 of these in the mail the other day. Put them on, went for a ride and all seemed good. Sitting in the living room i hear a loud sound in the kitchen (where i left the bike) and the tire is down. This is hours after the ride, no reason on apparent issue.I am positive that there was no sudden flat. I have actually never had a flat of any sort, and the area i ride is pavement and nothing else. This was defective out of the box. I dismounted the tire and checked things out. The tube has a leak because as it pumps up the slime is bubbling out but you cant see any hole- its that small. So i am not sure how or what the slime is supposed to do but fix and seal leaks it does not.Like i said, i bought 2 and only one leaked but at a higher price for its supposed leak repair abilities i think ill pass next time since i feel like i was ripped off."
1,Deceptive Packaging,"I needed a size 26x1.95 bike tube for my wife's bike. Looking at the packaging, one would assume this size would fit between the two sizes indicated (26 x 1.75-2.125) on the box. I assumed wrong. The tube was way too big for the tire and was completely useless."
2,Anti-patch!,"I bought one slime tube and when it was eventually punctured, I first heard a loud hiss, then I look down and my legs are sprinkled with green liquid. I briefly found the affected area of the bike tire and the hissing stopped for about three seconds. After that, the tube deflated completely. This product states the slime that is inside the tube will seal any punctures so the air will not escape from the tube. I noted this as a bit false or at least unlucky with me. That's the first strike.The second strike is, if you are trying to save money, like me, you want to patch your tires.With the slimy liquid coming out from the tube it's almost impossible to get a patch to stick to the tube.Although I did like how tough the tube is, I rather buy a regular tube to save money then to buy a new slime tube every time I have a flat.-Kevin."
1,Popped!,"I didnt even get a chance to put the wheel back on my bike. I aired the tube up to only 30 pounds and it blew out. Slime is a good brand of sealer, but I think another company makes the tubes and puts the slime in. Amazon is giving me a refund after I returned the bad tube."
2,good,you must be careful cause once air goes in it will plug up if u try and re-fit the tube so it seals but if it seals from the tube it will work on the trail
2,"I think one of mine was defective, failed near the valve","Have about 9 months use, no regular flats. Inflated to about 55lbs. But I found the tire flat next day after just riding around with the grandkids in the driveway. I think it had a defect in the tube, a pin head size flap let go right by the valve stem inner side ( not from spoke or pinch flat ). Spewed lots of green stuff around."
1,50% Failure,"I purchaesed and installed these tubes on my mountain bike. I also purchased new tires. The tube in the rear tire failed after just one 30 mi. ride. I found no objects in the tire, and the leak was in the middle of the outside of the tube, so it had not been pinched."
1,Terrible!,"Put this new tube in, rode my bike for less then a week and already a flat tire. And its not that I ran over anything, it ripped where valve stem connects. Very cheaply made, not happy at all"
1,sucks .,"explode when the psi was 20,, don't know why, and the green liquid were everywhere, pretty hate this... not recommened this one."
2,Smart Tube review,"The idea about this method, to place Slime inside an inner tube, is good. I bought two of these tubes and one was leaking after installation. I had to go to a local store to buy a new inner tube to be able to finish the installation. I appears that the tube itself is too fragile."
5,Seems pretty heavy-duty for the price,"Liked the fact that it had a removal tool. Arrived on time. Like that the tube was sealed in cellophane. Has good feel, and seems like it will last well."
2,Disapponiting.,"I ordered several of these tubes expecting to not have to change a bike tire for a long time. I was sorely disappointed. I'm not sure why, but I have had several flats on every bike I've put these on. I haven't treated them roughly - I just ride to school and back, about a mile each way. I keep the bikes outside, but I'm not sure what difference that would make. The tubes appear to be particularly vulnerable around the valve, and when something goes wrong smelly green stuff gets oozes out around the valve.In short: try something else! This is a great idea but has been horribly executed by the Slime guys."
1,False sense of security,I've been stranded twice by these tires. Sure it can fix some flats but if you get a pinch flat (common in the rockies) it doesn't work. Worst of all the slime makes it so you can't patch the tire effectively (no matter how carefully you clean).Avoid the gimmick and just use your $1 patch kit and don't be stranded.
3,Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't,"I've been using these tubes for years. When I get a puncture, I can hear the air coming out. Sometimes they seal before all the air leakes out and sometimes they don't seal at all. I've even gotten flats with the extra thick version of these tubes. The last time I got a flat, I was 19 miles away from home. From that point on, I carry an extra tube with me with all the tools to fix a flat out on the road. These aren't bad tubes, just don't expect miracles."
1,Waste of money.,"I had to walk my bike home twice with these. And as if that isn't hard enough with a normal tire in the heat, the ""slime"" tires are slower than a normal one. I could hear a ""slosh"" sound and it felt like I was dragging lead. I've had other tires that lasted over a year and are still going strong. Will never buy these again."
1,Don't waste your money,"These tubes are heavy, don't do a great job at preventing leaks, and are messy as hell when they die."
1,Lasted almost 30 minutes.,"I let a guy at our local bike shop talk me into buying this ""awesome"" tube. Same exact tube, except it was $14.95 at the bike shop. I popped it going over a rock in less than 30 minutes on a trail that I ride all the time. It bled green slime all over the inside my tire. It did NOT repair itself. What a waste of money and time! What a joke! Never again."
1,useless product,It costs double of regular tube. The green slime just kept on bubbling when there was a puncture.... USELESS
1,not the real slime tubes,I have bought the slime tubes before at local stores and they lasted longer than we had the bikes. I bought several of these on amazon for my bikes and they do not have anything in them and they were punctured within 2 weeks. Buy them from a reliable local bike store.
2,These just don't work.,"Bought a couple of these and they work great until you get a flat. Once the puncture happens they leak green goo all over the place, making a complete mess of your tire. They don't work to seal off the leak at all. You might as well just buy regular tubes without the green goo in it. I am going to try liners next to prevent flats. I think the green goo is just a gimmick."
4,Cheap. fast delivery and good quality,"The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is I don't know how long it's going to last since I haven't had it for very long, but so far I'm impressed."
4,something shady,"Enjoyed this book. Came up to the standards of the first Stoner McTavish mystery. Spooky plot,suspenseful, and a little romance (not too graphic sex scenes); good read."
2,Expensive Sugar,"I didn't pay attention to the price when I ordered this box of sugar. It's very expensive and let's face it, sugar is sugar."
1,very poor.,the film is pretty terrible. the story is poor and does not make too much sense. the acting is reminiscent to that of a x rated movie. i watched it hoping it would get better but it just does not.really dont bother with this one.
3,Faust Puppet Theater,"Odd little film using marionettes. Music tended to detract from the piece. If you are interested in puppet theater, you'll like this. Film is short in length; marionettes are well operated."
5,Happy,"used this finishing cream before and just felt in love with it .the cream has just the right amount of oil and is not greasy at all, really leaves your hair nice and soft.thank you!"
4,Works wonderfully!,I love this product. It moisturizes my super dry hair. I'm between relaxers and it moisturizes and smoothes my hair as if I have a fresh relaxer.
5,I finally found it!,My hair stylist recommended this product and I wasn't able to find it anywhere. Of course amazon had to have it. Its amazing if you have damaged hair or you blow dry it on a regular basis. My only tip would be don't use to much --- if you do your hair looks oily.
5,Great product!,We found this cream when visited the States a couple of years ago. My daughters and wife love it because it leaves their hair shiny and smooth after the styling.
1,100% useless movie,"i could have produced a better movie using my iphone camera. Looks like the producer spent around 100 bucks in filming the movie. the director should be a fan of toys, all helicopters, missiles, even cars are toys. i repent on spending $2.99 for such kiddish movie... the villian looks like some homeless person, cant bare it."
1,Mockbuster - don't bother,Not what I expected--very disappointed. It is nothing but a mockbuster. Save your time and money unless you like low-budget knockoffs.
3,Better Than The Orlando & Milla Effort !,"Starring: Alan Rachins, David Chokachi and Kane Hodder.Directed by: Cole McKayPretty amazing effort to entertain with a familiar name in action-adventure films.The action stuff is truly breathtaking and moves really fast to plot points that make sense and add to excitement of effort.The chracter names you are used to are here and the evil Cardinal is represented by LA LAW `s Alan Rachins.The evilness continues with David Chokachi from BAYWATCH fame and he shows many skills that can still be added to his acting efforts.The cameos reach a pinnacle with F13 JASON,Kane Hodder gives a fleeting character some horrible glee in his tasks.This should be a big hit in rentals and sales, It has everything for the fan and even occasional viewer of Redbox or Netflix fodder."
4,I Find it Bitter,"I just made two cups of this tea after finding it at the grocery store. I tried boiling and then hot steaming water to see if it there was a taste difference. Yuck! it was bitter to me and I did not care for the taste at all. I threw out the first boiled cup and drank the second since I did not want to waste more. I still gave it 4 stars since it gave me a bit of an energy boost and is full of antioxidants. I am not really a big tea drinker, but I know bitter when I taste it and this definitely bitter and not very pleasant tasting. This might not be the case for everyone and maybe it is the green tea part, either way I will continue looking for a good tasting green tea."
3,"Great shoe, but color off","I buy this Jazz shoe in black for my daughter who has very wide feet. The fit and function is great for the gals with wide feet! I was disappointed when I ordered the Tan color, however. The color is very grey and looks much different than the tan shoes worn by the other dancers in her troop!!"
5,great jazz shoes,"My 12 y.o. daughter wears a size 5 youth, medium width street shoes.The size 7.5 jazz shoes fits good (size 7 was snugged & was returned).Comfortable and well-made. Slip-on makes it easy to put on-and-off.I like the elastic sides and the leather-like bottom. My daughter has noproblem dancing in these shoes!"
5,Great shoes !,"Have always purchased this brand for my daughter. We love them. They fit great, they look great, and are a great value."
4,Excellent value,"This is a very nice performer -- comfortable face skirt, very easy to adjust to fit, nice construction. The snorkel is well designed to keep water out, and the mouthpiece is comfortable. My only quibble is that the head straps are a bit narrow and can be uncomfortable unless you adjust it just right. My old set (made by Body Glove) had a pad on the headstrap that was a bit more forgiving. But, all in all, it works well, and I would certainly recommend it."
3,My kids found this boring,"This game sounded fun from the description, but it never took off with my kids. After several rounds, they were bored, and it hasn't been touched ever since."
2,Fun Game TERRIBLE CARD QUALITY!,We have played this game 4 times and from time two the 3 and 12 card split due to the CHEAPNESS of the Card. Fun game with lots of potential too bad it will be garbage since the other cards a showing terrible wear also.I would have happily paid $1.00 extra for the cards to last. E-mail me if & when you improve the quality and I'd be happy to amend this review.
5,entire family enjoyed it,nice card camp bit of a European touch it is fun with enough strategy to be interesting
3,Slide 5 problem,"Slide 5 has a problem with cards containing a 6, 8 & 9 with no other digits. The problematic cards are: 6, 9, 66, 68, 86, 89, 98 and 99. 8,69,88 and 96 are not problems. The 8 problem cards are not clear.Example 1: cannot tell if a 6 is a 9 or a 9 is a 6. Example 2: can't tell whether a 66 is a 99 or a 99 is a 66. Example 3: can't tell if a 68 is an 89 or an 89 is a 68. Example 4: can't tell if an 86 is a 98 or an 98 is a 86. If this problem is rectified, I would appreciate a corrected deck of cards or a replacement of the 8 problem cards."
2,I was there when they recorded this...,"I was at Scullers when they recorded the live parts of this album. There were lots of great moments in that concert...unfortunately, none of them made it onto the album. It's like they took only the dull parts of the concert. The studio portions aren't much better. I'm a huge fan of Danilo Perez and John Patittucci but this album is really boring!"
4,Good Performance,Better than I was expecting. A good summary of their classic 1970's songs. This one is worth getting and is a keeper.
3,Whi interrupting the concert wiyh interviews ?,Nice recording.I dont understand why good performances have to be interrupted with interviews !!!Otherwise this could have been a superd DVD
1,Goes in trash,"I have seen many bands perform in my time, and back in the late 60's, and 70's, none of them were as good as Three Dog Night. The way the 3 singers harmonized together,no other band could get that good.I've seen TDN perform many times in the late 60's and 70's, but this was the worse of any band I ever saw. I had to rate this with 1 star to even give it a rating, but it isn't worth 1 star. I don't know what made me think they could be half way decent without Chuck Negron.This one hit the trash after I watched it. I bought Three Dog Night: Soundstage which shows how talented this band was and can be."
4,"Well, I liked it.","I loved Three Dog Night when I was in junior high, but I never did a lot of reading or research into the personnel or the history of the band, so I didn't know at the time I watched this that one of the primary (if not the primary) voice of the band was missing (Chuck Negron).That said, I must say that I enjoyed hearing the old Three Dog Night classics updated and refreshed with some of the symphonic accompaniments and introductions. I understand why the purists might not like this, but I thought it was fun."
3,Greatest Hits with Orchestra,Three Dog Night Live with the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra is an eighty minute walk down memory lane for many fans of classic rock. All of the hits are on display but sadly some of the punch is gone.A large part of the problem is that the disc was over produced. There are strange shot compositions and interview footage spliced into the show. The split screen images are there to be cool and wind up detracting from the show. Many have said that this is not the same band without Chuck Negron. This may be so but you have to take what you can get. The disc is a good introduction for new fans or the casual listener but it won't work for the purist.The disc includes a silent photo montage as its only extra.Rent it if you must see it.
2,Three Dog Night - Live with the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra,"If you are a purist fan of Three Dog Night, you probably will be disappointed. They should have used the original charts for the songs. It was a great set, however, as a LIVE Concert there were too many superimposed images that appeared to be added in post production. I believe the interviews and flashbacks should have been placed on the DVD as an extras. The gallery had no sound at all. If you are a Three Dog Night fan, hopefully sometime soon they might bring out another concert DVD with a different production team. I bought this DVD to see and hear Three Dog Night."
3,Wattman,"Where's Chuck?? Please- Please bury the hatchet guys!!With that request being said, the disk looks and sounds great. Danny's and Cory's voices sound strong and in tune!! The only reason this dvd doesn't get 5 stars is because of Chuck's absence. It is good to see Michael and Jimmy on there too. Floyd?????? Joe R.I.P. buddy. In my opinion it is 2 dog night without Chuck- not 3. That 3rd harmony and lead vocal is sorely missed. The band sound great, along with the orchestra.Would Love to see them with Chuck in concert(can you say sellout)!!"
5,Great DVD,"This DVD has great performances and great production. The band sounds so good. I love this DVD. If your a Three Dog Night fan, I'm sure you will love it too. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD!"
3,need chuck,it is 2 dog night without chuck negron.....where is chuck ..need him for it to be three dog night....bad for cory and denny
1,Less-than-a-Three Dog Night,"I have been a Dog fan since their debute album. My LP collection has all but ""It's A Jungle"". I've seen them in concert multiple times. If there's one thing that is certain, without Chuck Negron, Three Dog Night is like a 3-legged dog. Still a good companion, but won't run. Don't get me wrong - Danny and Cory can belt out a tune with the best of them. But Three Dog Night is Danny, Chuck, Cory, Mike, Floyd, Joe (replaced by Jack), and Jimmy. Period! For what it's worth..."
3,Skip/Go to Chuck Negron,"Get his live album. Go to Negron.com to see when his new live DVD will be available. (Very Soon).I saw the original Dogs, many, many times, in fact, it was my first concert at 13.I'm 47 now, and without Chuck, they're still ok, just not the stars of the show.Neither of these fellows, have Chucks range, or intonation.It's a shame that they're not all together.I'll bet it has something to do with ego's?Be Well.Pete"
3,3 Dog Night,"I thought the music selection was great, but I didn't think much of the Symphony Orchestra together."
5,Great DVD,Just watched the DVD.I am an old fan of Three Dog Nightand was very pleased with the DVD.This was one of there latest gigs andam amazed how seasoned they are.
3,"great sound, years later.","GOOD SOUND, GOOD QUALITY. ONLY DOWN-SIDE, NO CHUCK NEGRON. IHAVE THEIR CAPTURED LIVE AT THE FORUM (ONE OF MY FAVORITES) &THESE GUYS SOUND JUST AS GOOD LIVE AS THEY DO IN THE STUDIO.HIS NAME IS NOT EVEN MENTIONED. THREE DOG NIGHT - MINUS ONE...."
5,loving it,"As expected, the symphony added a new dimension to the performance. But the energy and redition of these classic songs by the band itself was great. I think this would be a welcome suprise for anyone who has not seen them perform live, and also for anyone who loves these songs. I think they have only gotten better. A real treat for old fans or new listeners."
1,Pathetic Attempt,"I have been a HUGE TDN fan since ""One"" and this does not constitute a comeback, rather a death toll. Let's face it, Cory Well's and chuck Negron carried this group through some fantastic vocals and having Cory and a very mediocre Danny Hutton trying to cover Negron's songs just simply DOES NOT WORK. Let's talk about moving on in life. Ok, one new song, otherwise they are still living off of 30 years ago. Pathetic. They should be talented enough (even withut Negron) to come up with some new material. Negron has, why can't they? My advice, skip this piece of junk and get Negron Cd's and his Live DVD. Much better quality, better vocals, and some NEW songs instead of the same old 30 year old stuff. Time to move ahead Cory.... try getting on your knees and begging Negron to come back and lead this group again with his great vocals and interpretations..."
3,Fabulous Illustrations,"Henry had a knack for tinkering. From a very young age, he would put things together and create machines that would whip, whap, click and snap. At first his machines began taking over his bedroom, so he moved into the bathroom. Then, when all the rest of the house was taken over by his machines, he and his parents moved into the yard. When the yard was totally consumed with his machines, his parents moved up into a tree house. The absurdities continue in this non-sensical story until the day the young boy's parents finally insist that the machines must go. This children's book, with it's creatively illustrated pages is sure to get the creative juices flowing in the minds of young readers.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
2,"Good Talent, Atrocious Director","Ramzi Abed might be a wonderful man, but he is one of THE worst directors. I do not mean that he is bad in a good way. The talent he had working for him, in this one film, excels what most Hollywood directors will have in a lifetime. The acting talent is a dream team to salivate over. Ramzi wastes this opportunity tossing the actresses between scenes like an angry orangutan and a bevy of Dame Darcy's dolls.Ramzi, Ramzi, if you were AT ALL sensible, you would have asked Kerr or Darcy to help write this little daydream mistakenly revealed to the public. I would love to see you do one of Delany's novels, preferrably Dhalgren. Please have Delany handle the script. K? Thx. BBL."
3,"Bad? yes, but worth a look.","Literally thousands of people have seen bootlegs of this Roger corman film from the early 1990's. Yes, it is a basically cheap film, produced by Mr. Corman and it shows. BUT, for a film done for less than 2 million dollars, what they accomplishes was pretty impressive. When shown the final product, it showed several people what could be done with the F.F. on a shoe-string budget and gave many hope for what someone could eventually do with a BIG budget. Although nowhere near as good as the recent blockbuster, this film does have a few advantages. It's Doctor Doom is in the right outfit and the Thing looks pretty darn good too! Give it a try."
2,"""Look At You, The Fantastic Four""","The intended never-to-be released '94 version of `The Fantastic Four' produced by Roger Corman is finally available to hardcore comic book fans in this import DVD. For those who are familiar with Roger Corman productions let me assure you that this movie delivers everything you've come to expect from a Corman production; low budget production values, laughable special effects, cheesy soundtrack, comic book dialogue and sub-par acting.Despite all the negatives there is a spirit to the film that eventually captured my interest and kept me watching until the very end. Whether that ""spirit"" aforementioned is something to be attributed to Corman for infusing into the film or something nostalgic residing within myself is uncertain. Since the Fantastic Four was one of my favorite comics growing up it's probably the latter.This is definitely a film that can only truly be appreciated by Marvel comic book fans."
4,i hope they release this Roger Corman Version.,i have one of the poor copys.i loved the show myself.sure it could of been made better as far as f/x but its still a good show.old shows dont have great f/x but there still great storys.to me the f/x is not all that bad for what they had to work with.i for one will be the first in line to buy this.i just hope the prints are still around to do so.if not i guess ill have to live with my poor copy.please release this show.
3,Campy Fun on DVD-R,"This movie is cheesy, campy and fun. Even with negligible production values, it is more entertaining than the new Fantastic Four movies, and the story is actually better.One warning however, the copy I got was a computer burned DVD-R (purple disc) and I could not play it with my DVD player or computer. My PS2 for some reason was able to play it, though it skipped."
5,Another great workout from Tanja,"Tanja is my all-time favorite fitness instructor. I love working out at home and own many different types of workouts with a wide range of instructors, and Tanja's attitude is by far the most inspiring. I find myself smiling and laughing during every one of her workouts, and that is actually really important and refreshing. Even though I work out six days a week and am in fairly good shape (I'm 23), this was a challenge for me. I only used 3 pound weights and could really feel the burn! This is great because I can increase the weight later. I feel like this is a really well-rounded workout and Tanja is so clear about everything. My mom, who is just coming back to exercise, can also benefit from this workout more than others because the modifications are clearly demonstrated and the choreography is not too fancy or confusing. I'm really looking forward to doing this workout again!"
3,Meh...,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to mix up my routine and make it more challenging. I made my decision based on the reviews, but I have to say that it fell far short of my expectations--and that's saying a lot given that I tried it for the first time after a very loooong and stressful day. It's probably a good beginner/intermediate workout, but Tanja takes longer breaks than what I personally prefer. It's not enough to really test your limits. I'd rather keep my heart rate up and really feel like I pushed as hard as possible afterwards. I guess this will just have to be one of my new go-to's on my light days."
2,NOT a cardio workout,"This exercise DVD is NOT for people who are looking for a cardiovascular workout. It is almost exclusively sculpting and weight training, not as advertised. I workout quite often and I thought many of the movements on the Abs segment of the workout were so difficult that I was not even able to complete them. I would not recommend this to a friend, it did not fulfill my expectations."
4,Overall satisfactory,"I am an intermediate beginner, I found this one to be good. She keeps me engaged and with brief breaks I manage to complete the entire DVD."
3,Like the shorter workouts but not as much fun as other videos,I like the short workouts. There are a series of them from 7 to 12 minutes. Nice for those days when you just don't really want to work out so you can do one or two of them and feel like at least you did something that day. They aren't as fun as the other balance ball and dance videos that I have though.
2,Disapointed,"I bought this video based on the reviews and boy was I sadly mistaken! I am a personal trainer at 24hr. fitness but I prefer working out at home not only for times sake, but I feel I can get a more challanging routine in my living room than bother with lines for all the equiptment at the gym. This DVD has a bunch of weird moves that were very unfunctional (Ive never seen these moves before) like the tippytoe half turn lunges, who can menuver that move on carpet anyways? I do like the instructor, she gives good verbal ques and has great energy so for that reason I gave my rating two stars. I like Jari Love's collection of videos or Bob Harpers stuff. Save your money-unless your at a beginner level and want to step it up, but all you advanced exercisers-DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!"
4,Arlo's path,"Arlo Guthrie had a childhood of son of... Woodyan adolescent of ...Bob Dylana young adulthood of... ""Alice's Restaurant""and this, an amalgam of all he grew up to be.Songs devoted to daddy, Bob, and hisself.This is Arlo's purist LP, a young man loving his father's legacy, his godfather's songwriting art, and his spiritual ache/blessing.This is Gospel as pure as praying on a drunken Saturday night knowing what might happen on Sunday."
2,Timothy the Toolman,What I got was an extension for a fostner bit. What I wanted in in the picture and not what I thought is was..
1,Didn't help at all,This book did not help me at all. The math section was slightly helpful for the ONE fraction related question on this test. I'm out money for this book and i didn't even pass the test.
1,Civil Service Exam,The supplier did not ship the item on time. The electronic download on this product was not succesful. The customer email address given on the confirmation is non-existent.
2,Interesting premise not fulfilled,"This book has an interesting premise: that the central theme of Western art has been the exaltation of the human body. Unfortunately it doesn't do a particularly good job of making its case; instead, Rice rambles on about random masterpieces that ostensibly support his thesis. At some point he makes the claim that Fragonard's ""The Bathers"" is ""the most powerful composition in the world."" Seriously? According to the author, art gets derailed in the 19th century, and what we need to get back on track is a unifying purpose. While I'm sympathetic to his nostalgia for a time when painting and sculpture was central to culture, Rice's conservatism strikes me as profoundly naive and close-minded."
1,Had no effect upon my blood pressure,"These tablets are advertised to have an effect on blood pressure. After taking them for four months, I had absolutely no effect -- nothing up, nothing down -- and therefore I may as well have been taking plain sugar pills to achieve the same effect. My opinion is that these just do not do what they say they do."
2,Very uneven stories,"I only picked up this book because Stephen Coonts name was on it. ""Eyes of the Cat"" was the best story. ""Hangar Rat"" was a total waste of time - the hanger rat turns out to be an alien. How does that fit into a WWII book?"
5,Well Worth The Wait Awesome Cd,This is a great cd perfect for the fans of the progressive and fans of dance and electronic dance music. There is something here for everyone so if you want something good to groove to and dance to get this cd you will not regret it. This should be in everyones collection that is a fan of any kind of dance music. Oh yeah and Nadia's voice rocks I like how she keeps up with every track on here theres not one track on the cd that overpowers her.
2,Not what I expected,I thought this was going to be more of a techno/trance cd but it was not. Most of the songs are very slow.
2,"Great sound, bad songs",There were only two songs that were upbeat and fun to listen to. These guys have great sound together BUT.....it you want upbeat (like something you can dance/workout to) just download the two upbeat songs ans save your $$.
2,listen before you buy,I bought this cd because of songs listed which I've heard on satellite. The songs on the cd are not what you hear on the radio- the versions on the cd are mundane and plodding at best- had I been able to listen first I would not have bought this album
5,One more excellent Packer Video for your collection!,"A great highlight film of the 1998 season. As Mike Holmgrens last video as coach, it is definately a collector item."
5,Tuff Jeff Salen & Johnny Black keep NYs Underground alive!,"Tuff Jeff Salen is back to form on ""Love and Trouble"" originally from The Tuff Darts self titled Classic PUNK album. Songs like ""Boy Chases a Girl"" written by Jeff and sung by Jeff & The Band, ""Down to the Edge of Town' written by Black & Salen,(sung by Black)& Hancock's ""Just Ask Me"" echo New York's Punk Underground at it's height--A time when The New York Dolls, Johnny Thunders and The Ramones used to share the stage with Jeff's first band The Tuff Darts. An instant classic by Pioneers from CBGBs Jeff Salen, Johnny Black & Chuck Hancock. Call your radio station. Buy it! Make it a hit!"
4,Better than the movie,"I was not much of a fan of the movie. (I couldn't stand the over use of the ""Hollywood Bullet."") But my friend told me about this series and I was hooked. Over the whole series we get more background about Rico, Dizzy & Carmen. My biased favorite episode is the last one on this disk because it takes place at Kaena Point, O'ahu, Hawaii. It's only about 30mi from where I live."
1,CAUTION - I don't think this is as advertised,"This certainly is not a resale DVD as the BBC Series of Roughnecks has yet to be put on DVD or VHS in any region/format (as of this writing, 28 Feb 2006). I have sent numerous emails to the seller asking for details only to get form emails back, one of which told me they had no product details. I strongly suspect this is a Roughnecks: Starship Trooper DVD.As far as the rating system, I give the Roughneck series 5 STARS and then some. What I'm rating is the seller's lack of willingness to answer the question whether this is truly the BBC Roughnecks and am putting the one star to, again, sound a note of caution to any buyer."
3,"Good, but disappointed!","Don't get me wrong. I love the animation and the CGI graphics. It's some of the best I've seen. But I waited a long time for this series to come to DVD, because it's almost never shown in chronological order on television.I ordered this particular DVD because I was expecting/waiting for the excellent episode called ""Trackers"". This was the episode where the troopers followed the Queen bug to earth after a game of ""hide and seek"" in deep space.In ""Trackers"" we learned a great deal about Higgins (the reporter) and we saw an excellent space battle that rivaled some of the greatest sci-fi movies in existence today.So those of you who purchase this DVD should know that ""Trackers"" is MIA. I don't know about anyone else, but when I purchase a DVD, I at least want ALL of the episodes that were available on television."
5,"At long last, the unaired episodes!","Recently I was pleasantly surprised to see DVDs of the Hydora, Tesca, and Tophet campaigns in a local video retailer. The last DVD that I was aware of being released was Pluto Campaign. I have seen all but the last 3 episodes on tv when they were originally aired, so I'm greatly looking forward to seeing the completion of the series. I am a HUGE fan of the show and have been VERY VERY lucky to have attended 3 conventions that several of the voice actors and production staff attended. Next to Gargoyles, this series was by far one of the best 'cartoon shows' that I have ever seen. Great detail was given to the character development and story line. It had great writers and had some great plot twists. Rico rules, but Gossard is God!"
3,Wish the stitching was better,"I purchased this toy because of all of the wonderful reviews it received but after I received it and examined it before I gave it to my son I was very disappointed to find that the stitching had come loose in two different places. My son loves this toy however and I am glad I purchased it, just wished the stitching was better. If you purchase this toy make sure to check the stitching before giving to your child."
5,My daughter's favorite friend!!,"This WONDERFUL giraffe was given to us as a baby gift. From the very start, my daughter has loved this giraffe!! She likes to nibble on his ears and tail. She loves to play with the legs and cuddle with him, We can not leave the house without taking him with us! She got him when she was only about a month old, and she is almost 9 months old now, and still loves him. He has become quite a good friend for her :) I highly recommend Stretch the Giraffe, and we will have to buy another one incase she loses him."
3,"Fun toy, not so stretchy","I bought Lamaze's Stretch the Giraffe thinking the legs would be stretchy and fun for my 5 month old to grab onto, but the legs don't stretch really at all and the squeaky foot is weak. My son still does enjoy playing with it, since it is colorful and the front feet jingle and chime, but he likes the peacock Lamaze toy MUCH better."
2,Not impressed :(,"I got Jacques the Peacock for my dayghter when she was 2,5 months old. She instantly fell in love with it. Then I bought the worm and she loved it to. She wrestles with it till this day and enjoys biting on the ""legs"". The Stretch the Giraffe, however, is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. She is not interested in it at all. It does not do much. The rattles are very quiet and the teeting rings are very hard to bite as they are on the giraffe's neck and there is rally no way for my daughter to get to them... I say buy it for a 2-3 mo old because older children will not find it amusing."
2,Stitching comes apart,"Beware of the stitching, my 4 month old who has no teeth was able to get the stitching on one of the feet loose and proceeded to try to eat the stuffing, which in turn she started to choke on. Not something you want to hear at 5am from your babies bed."
5,Loves it,"well designed, well thought out. each foot makes a different sound. the legs make it easy to grap at and hold (in those early days when they can't seem to actually HOLD what they are going for). and the clasp to let it go with you is a plus."
3,Nice toy,"This toy distracts my 6 month son for a short while, he likes to pull on the legs then he gets bored. I think there are better car seat toys out there. On the plus side you can attach this toy to the baby gym."
3,"False description, False Search result- Not made in USA",This was an adorable gift but It was NOT made in USA; which was the search I did to find it. Also the description did not have where it was made listed. The label on the toy clearly says Made in China. If it wasn't so cute I would have returned it.
3,Fun toy but the Butterfly is better!,"This toy is fun, but it doesn't hold my daughter's attention like the butterfly. Also, it would help if the clip was either a little longer or positioned differently."
2,not quiete what I expected,"Well I ordered this toy to put on my daughters car seat, and I know this is a pretty large toy you could see from the pictures ppl post, but I looked at this because when I write in car seats toys, this came up. but the legs are to long and are right on my daughter face and she hates it! and I do too! I thought the legs stretched in a form like when u pull them down they go back up by themselves in slow motion or something but no the stretch is wack, its like stretching a shirt. I kept the toy just beacuse I dont want to to through the process of returning it for only 10$ maybe when my daughter gets older shell like it. shes 3 mo. now"
1,Buy Freddie the Firefly instead,My child hates this toy. He likes Freddie the firefly much better. This toy does not make the crinkle noise. The foot is suppose to honk and stopped honking after one month of light play as child was only 3 months old. My child at one point was afraid of this animal. It does have bright colors but is not fun for him at all. I highly recommend freddie the firefly by lamaze instead.
5,My baby boy LOVES LAMAZE toys,"Bought this for my then 3 month old. 2 months later he still loves to chew on the feet and swing it back and forth. We have quite a few lamaze toys, but I tend to buy the ones with the sqeakers in them. He loves to hear the noise."
2,Regretable,I thought Martin Lawrence would be on these. NOPE! It's the episodes after he left. Even Joe Torry isn't in these ones. I was REALLY disappointed. The advertising for this product made it seem like these were the original episodes. Boo!
4,An attempt at a hard SF work,"The Eternity Artifact is about a mysterious alien sphere disappearing out of our galaxy and the efforts made to study it before it vanishes.Modesitt's writes in the viewpoints of different characters, but struggles to make them unique. They all seem the same, even the lone female character sounds like a man in disguise.His writing style remains the same, with terse sentences and ideas that could be elaborated on ignored. Thankfully, he's kept the endless ellipses used in other novels down to a minimum in The Eternity Artifact.The story is very good, with the space exploration, technical themes and general galactic theories well worked out. The sabotage attempts and fighting tend to distract and could have been left out without damage to the novel.Worth reading for modesitt fans."
2,Confusing and OK,"I found this book very confusing, as the author continually changes the charecter he is talking about. I made it about 2/3 through the book having no idea what was happening. What parts I did understand were good."
1,tedious slow and boring,"There are a few mildly interesting characters in this join the dots space opera, at least at the start. As the story goes on they become mere cardboard cutout players. In simple - Mystery planet requires long expidition to discover alien stuff. Some run of the mill space wars and some rather dull exploration of the planet all added up to not much. You are kept turning the pages on the expectation that something exciting will happen. But it don't. The mystery planet turns out to be full of nothing and the characters turn out to be uninteresting page fillers. I was bored out of my mind."
1,Too wordy...,"Good writer, but he is more concerned with his choice of words than just writing and putting together a good and entertaining story.I read words he used that I could not even find their definition of over the Internet. This writer needs to sit down before he writes his next book and determine what is most important.Impress the reader with fancy words or write a good story.Can he do it???"
3,a little deserving,"the picture showed a cup holder, but did not come with one. also required some assembly not noted in description."
3,Attack of Mutant Roaches!,"This entertaining post apocalyptic adventure has plenty of B-movie pleasures-giant scorpions, killer roaches ( the best sequences) and those crazy sky light show effects. The cast is also solid with Jan Michael Vincent in his prime. A good pop corn movie - the DVD looks fine but sounds better specially Jerry Goldsmith score."
2,For Collectors,"Roger Zelazny fans: yes this is a movie made from the book. I gave it 2 stars just because of that. As far as I know this is the only attempt at bringing any of Zelazny's work to the screen. IMHO it ranks somewhere down alongside the Dr Strange movie; not what we want, but it's all we got. It has been described as being loosely based on the book and although Zelazny pulled his name from the credits because it was a bit too far off the mark for him, you can still recognize it as such. It's not as completely fabricated as the Bond movies, but it isn't especially faithful either. It's also a product of it's generation... you will recognize the cast from old TV shows like A-Team and Airwolf... so be aware of that shortcoming as well."
3,Oldy but a Goodie,"The movie is most similar to Ark II, but with more adult themes(no porn or anything like that but still more aimed at an older audience). Good action with an ""Airwolf"" and an ""A-Team"" cast which is sure to excite. If you like post-apocalyptic science fiction, this is for you."
5,Landmaster steals the movie,"Here is a little known fact did you know the landmaster is the front half of a science / mars vehicle that came out before the movie. The science vehicle, for that mater every detail in the game, was highly detailed inside and out. The game was also set post apocalyptic. If, and I do not think many have, ever read/gotten/or just messed with the game in the store, you would see a LOT of the game was taken and put into the movie like the landmaster, the flesh eating cockroaches, Giant mutant scorpions, etc... I only remember all these Juicy details because I was cleaning out the closest a while back and came across the game books and schematics. Any way, this was and is a great movie, but like my title says the landmaster is the over tone of the movie from my point of view. This is one of those movies that is a must grab for your collection if you can. Of course DVD is all ways better if you can."
1,DAMNATION ALLEY..DAMNATION SMALLEY..,"Don't waste your time on this clinker. I saw this in the movies when it first came out. I dragged my brother, his wife and some other unfortunate folk to it (yes, it was my pick). My brother, Handy Andy, has not let me live this down since..he taunts me about this monthly. So if you want to teased forever and exiled to your own ""Damnation Alley"".. show this flick to your family and friends (you will have to tie them to their chairs though)."
4,Damnation Alley - 70s Escapism,"This is one of those movies in my VHS collection that I manage to watch once every year or so...just to escape the realities of the real world. I don't rank this as a great movie in the same way that you'd rank an Academy Award winner, but it's just a fun movie to watch as long as you can suspend belief for a while. I have to think that the actors/actress had fun making it, as the main characters seem to tread the fine line between ""camp"" and ""classic"". If you want something that won't make you think too hard and will reward you with a little escapism in a post-apocalyptic sort of way, then this is one for your library.I don't understand why it still hasn't been released on DVD, but when it is, I'll be one of the first to buy it for my collection. The 1970s LIVE on and into the 21st Century!!!"
4,Anchor Bay,"Good news for fans of this movie, Anchor Bay are working their magic for a future release. I'm looking forward to seeing this uncut and best of all in WIDESCREEN, as I've only ever seen the shocking pan and scan that gets shown on television once in a blue moon. Hooray for Anchor Bay !"
2,Damnation Alley,We have just purchased Damnation Alley. We were not happy with this release. We have the recording on a dvd from tv from 15 years back and this new version has left out several scenes in the first 30 mins. It didn't show George Peppard talking to the General about sending a representatives to Albany and when the one man that caused the fire traded playboy mags for whiskey.
3,POST APOCALYPSE THRILLER DESERVES DVD STATUS,"This movie , along w/The Island (Michael Caine), should be made for DVD viewers! Damnation Alley reminds you of the Irwin Allen thrillers from the seventies. It has a good story line about Air Force survivors going out to explore the post nuclear world. The Cold War took place and the missles struck the U.S. Will the crew find survivors top side? George Peppard is the leader of the recon team. The basic mission is to look for food, water, habitable land, and any survivors.The special effects are par for the times, I wish someone would remake this film considering FX development today, along w/Fantastic Voyage. Damnation Alley reminds me a little bit of Lost In Space, Planet of the Apes, Omega Man (without the mutants), and Andromeda Strain, all rolled into one film. The writing and special effects could have been better but it is a fair Sci Fi feature to watch. Watch out for the mutant cockroaches!"
3,Aspect Ratio,This is more of a question than a review. Why is the streaming aspect ratio 1:33 to 1 when the DVD is 2:35 to 1?
4,Remember from when I first saw it..,"The begging and for the most of the movie is conceivable. It's been years since I first saw this movie, forgot how it ended till now. Which I still don't get. Seems the ending should've been time dated (i.e. 5 year's later). Appears to have happen overnight which for anybody to believe would happen without a explaination would be at lost. Overall a good movie, a little corny at times, but looking at when it was made, still good.."
5,REFRESHING...,"This is a refreshing, carbonated citrus soft drink that that resonates faintly of grapefruit. Made by the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, it has zero calories and none of the after taste often associated with diet sodas. If one is watching their weight and is tired of diet colas, one could not go wrong with Fresca"
2,New Social Stories don't live up to the Original,"I'm a speech language pathologist working with children with autism spectrum disorders. Access to good materials for social skills/pragmatics can be difficult to obtain, but Gray's Original Social Stories book was excellent! I work with children from kindergarten to middle school and this book meet many of my needs. This new edition, however, was more than disappointing. The stories weren't written well, the illustrations had little or no connection to the stories, and the stories were not relevant to the needs of children with disabilities. I returned the book and discovered that Ms. Gray had discontinued publication of the original book to promote this new edition. Ms. Gray, please re-release the original!!! I recommended it to many collegues and it's no longer available."
2,not what i expected,This book is not what I expected at all. My son is a higher functioning autistic child. This book is written as if a toddler were reading it. I was ezpecting a book that would help my son understand autism better.
2,Not as helpful as I would have hoped..,"I read the recommendations and thought, wow, this book could help us. Our son with Aspergers Syndrome took one look at it and thought we were nuts. He's having none of it. So thanks, but no thanks."
5,Dickey Lee: Great 70's country hits!,"I wish this CD had better availability, as it has great Dickey Lee songs that are virtually lost otherwise. This is the only CD I've found with ""Angels, Roses and Rain "" on it. That and ""9,999,999 Tears to Go"" are great memories of 70's country gold that deserve preservation. Some wonderful memories on this CD...I'll probably go ahead and buy it used before it's gone!"
5,Brings back many good memories,Good golden oldies with meaning. It is done with so much passion that you can close your eyes while listening.
5,The best prodct for auto care.,"I only use Meguiar's product for waxing and detailing my cars. See Amazon for a whole host of Meguiar's product. You can't realize how good Meguiars products are until you use them. Simply the best for wax's, and buffing supplies."
4,Cliffhangers...,"Devouring the book in one day I found it an enjoyable read. Yes, there were plenty of inconsistent action, but there were some good twists to keep me on my toes. Being a Star Trek fan made me buy the book, but the story itself kept me with it until I finished.The action was good...and the setup of the main character was very ""renaissance"" like with the military to academic background. Yes, I want to be like Tony.The back of the book is a bit misleading and I was slightly confused, there are books with worse that I have read so I won't hold them accountable for it.I'm now off to find the second book of the series..."
2,Not so good,"The book description isn't really accurate . . . the main character HASN'T heard of this crazy island, he happens upon it by chance only after being forced to go there by some 'unknown alien' that is inhabiting his friend's body.My biggest problem is that the main character doesn't act like a normal person would act in abnormal circumstances. His best friend's mind has been taken over by some alien force and he never once stops to question the guy as to why he's acting so strange - instead thinking that he's been injured by a blow to the head.I found the book to be full of cliche, not consistent (as if a collaboration where different authors wrote various scenes), and it didn't seem like it knew where it wanted to go. And then to end it with 'to be continued' really lost it for me. I don't think I can read through another in the Time Blender series . . ."
4,Time Blender made for good reading,"Michael Dorn's ""Time Blender"" made for a good evening's reading. Story line started quickly and kept moving throughtout the book."
5,"Michael Dorn's ""Time Blender""","I recently purchased and read this tremendously well written novel. Michael Dorn has truly written a masterpiece of science fiction/fantasy. The plot although one of fantasy depicts a battle between two factions of future humans. The Bodhi and the GECO. The Bodhi are in tune with nature and are of kind sentiment. The GECO are genetically altered humans who live off of pollution. The Bodhi are kind and friendly while the GECO are brutal and evil. An object, The Artifact, which maintains linear time is destroyed by the Bodhi. The main character, Tony Miller alone can alter the future. An excellent novel with a cliffhanger ending, this novel is bound for greatness."
1,Blasphemous,"I like Michael Dorn as an actor, but not as an author. This book is filled with extremely horrible and unnecessary profanity. You can't get to the storyline past this awful language. It is crude, offensive, and blasphemous. I do not recommend this book to anybody."
2,diving mask,I am very experienced using different masks and this one is not really that good. The straps and mask are made of a hard plastic not the soft piable silcon and does not strech or seal well. I bought it as an extra back up for friend to use.
4,sing a new song sunni jeffers,This book was written in 2007 and it was advertised as just being written in 2011. That has happened twice now to me. I buy these for my mother and it's a good thing she can remember what she has read. If you have not already read it it's very good.
5,Loved these folders - good quality!,"I ordered these folders to use when I send things to my accountant in another city. He gives everyone a tax booklet to fill out to help with preparation of taxes. Also I usually include several folders with things like copies of tax bills, etc.The different colors made it easier for me. When the office received the package they said ""Oh, we got your package with all those beautiful colors.""I probably will order more when these run out, for various uses."
1,never recieved these,We ordered these and they were canceled from the manufacturer..so being a teacher I needed them and loved the price but never got to see if they were good quality or not
2,False Count,"Imagine my surprise when i open up the box of folders for my class lesson and only 20 folders are inside instead of 25...So 5 people will be missing folders!!! I cannot believe it!!! How can people sell these kind of 'false' items!!! Teachers are counting on these products, especially if we paid money and it says 25 folders are in the box (not 5 less)! It can happen to you too!"
4,Does what it should,"These folders are great for organizing my classes. It comes in 5 different colors, so you never get confused which folder is which. Although they are card stock, which may not be the most durable material for a folder, there's 25 in the pack, which will last me years, and at that price, it's hard to beat."
3,5 colors (5 folders of each color),"5 colors (orange, blue, green, yellow and red) 5 folders of each color.The two brighter colors are orange and yellow. The blue is more like medium sky blue (lighter than the picture), red and green are as shown in the picture.The only problem is that the inside pockets are fairly stiff, and there is no cut-out in the center to help the paper go in easily - it takes a bit to get the paper to slide in. I may try cutting out a slant on the inside of each pocket and see if that helps with sliding the paper in."
4,Nothing wrong with these,"Solid folders for the money. Unlike many folders, they have a solid partition in the middle. This keeps papers straight in their respective sides of the packet, and prevents them from being crooked/getting folded when you close the folder. Decent deal for the money since you'll likely be able to reuse them. 25 will probably last me the rest of my school career."
4,Worth the price!,My kids were in desperate need of folders for school and they finally came! These are of better quality than the ones you pay 10 cents (on sale) for at an office supply store. I didn't need 25 of them but I least I can store them and they can take it whenever they need it. No more running to the store!
1,unstable,"Do not buy this product, I figure it was a good idea because the pin style could not possibly fail. However, care was not taken when constructing this product. The bottom plate is about 1/4"" steel and the welds sure penetrated well, but the welding overheated so much the bottom warped and both jackstands are not flat. The corners do not touch the floor just imagine how little of the bottom is actually making contact with the concrete, mostly only in the center, not my idea of safety. I checked with some other people with similar style jackstand made back in the good old days possibly in the USA too, and theirs is flat. In my opinion if the manufacturer cannot avoid warping then the bottom should have been machined flat and using a thicker material to begin with."
2,A Family Raised on Sunshine,"Very enjoyable book, but not well put together. Binding obviously glued and the book is falling apart. Good ""comfort food"" recipes."
4,"Super simple, super fast","This product does exactly what it should. It measures the amount of compression that your cylinder can sustain, and it does it with enough accuracy and repeatability that you can trust it.It is only missing a handy carry case, but if you approach the packaging in the right manner, you can use that to store your tester, and keep it in reasonably good shape. Of course, I realized this after I tore into the packaging with all of the skill and dexterity of a six year old boy with 4 cups of hot chocolate in him on Christmas morning.I purchased this unit because it has the adapter for small engines, those with a 10mm sparkplug hole. It has it, and it works. What more could you ask for?"
1,Not to happy!!,"The face on the gauge is made of plastic, and was scratched from the packaging. Pretty cheap design. The rest was pretty nice, I can't believe that they would make the gauge lense out of plastic."
4,run for cover,"for everyone that is looking for this years hot hot heat or the rapture you'll have to skip over Ex-Models. this isn't new wave or now wave. this is somthing entirely different. this is fragmented and deconstructed versions of the above mention genres. this is your rapture record played on 78 not 45 because that would be too slow. ... same angular rythms that you are used to in a lot of this no-wave, disco punk music like LIARS or whatever. The vocals even sound like david byrne (talking heads) or devo. but this is fast. this is grind core fast. this is pop it your cd player and drive 110 down the highway fast. spastic, shocking and so awesome. i would buy it today if i were you and throw away that copy of elephant while your at as kool keith would say this is future music.i was wrong this is new wave because this is new, no other band sounds like this band.13 songs in 20 minutes."
4,Portraits of the Heart,I think the poems are very well written and the pictures are of down to earth real people. The author has done a great job with the meaning of real people in actual life. Some poems actually gave me goosebumps. Well done!
1,Bleah!,"A third rate production of a third rate opera. I only rented (thank god I had the foresight not to buy it) this opera because of all the rave reviews, most frequently performed opera in the world (I thought that was Carmen, which I also don't like), etc., I already knew I hated it. Didn't finish it, in the 30 or 45 minutes I watched, there was only one tune, Celeste Aida, weakly sung. The ballet at the idol was ridiculous. The direction was by the numbers. The aplause from the audience was as reluctant and meager as I felt listening. And the whole thing was saturated with the words ""death"" and ""kill"" and ""war."" Isn't there enough of that in the world without reveling in it in music! This was a far cry from music."
1,"boring,bad,and terouble",There is nothing good about it. I thought it was a rip off.My parents areage.
5,MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!,Lets get 1 thing clear. You need the Strategy Guide if you even think of getting Poke'mon ruby or sapphire. If you don't you will be soo confused and give up. It will be sitting around the house collecting dust. So get the Strategy Guide and you will have a new favorite game!!
4,"Guide Is A Good Choice, But It Isn't The Best","I do not own the guide, but my friend does. He got through halfthe game without the guide. In his words - ""The guide is a good choice, but it isn't the best possible."" The guide only helps those Pokemon trainers who search for rare Pokemon, and if they are stuck in a part of the game. I say yay, but if you are a pro at most Pokemon games, don't spend the money on the guide."
3,It's.. Um.. Great...,"The book was very informative but not even comparable to the strategy Guide I had for Pokemon Crystal by Versus Books. Prima's doesn't tell you where each pokemon is in the pokedex (Versus does), doesn't say which item is which on a map (Versus does) and doesn't tell where to find certain berries (WHICH VERSUS DID). Versus Books: PLEASE Come out with a Ruby/Sapphire manual!"
1,I Can Buy The Nintendo Guide?,All the review are said the book is bad!!!i want to know if i can buy the nintendo power offical guide?That guide can buy in the pokemon center but it sold out!the prices in amazon.com are very best but the guide vitiantion the order.
2,This book is bad!,"This book doesn't tell how to get to the secret cave and it doesn't tell how to break the secret code. But there are some good things. It has 200 pokemons in its pokedex; it tells how many levels a pokemon will evolve, and like Groudon, when Groudon is at Level 50 it will learn Rest. And this book will tell what HM/TM that a pokemon can learn. It will tell what a pokemon is afraid of or not afraid of and it will tell which type of the pokemon it is."
5,Perfect Strategy Guide!,"This book really is great! It shows you weaknesses to the Elite Four, and helps you throughout the game. It also shows the Pokemon the Gym trainers have, which will help you figure out what Pokemon you need to bring to the Gym."
3,Could be better,"This book is great, but it could be better. Therer are no directions through the hideout. It does not tell you what attacks do better against the gym leaders, but it does reccomend attack types. It does not have a good map of mirage island. At 15.00, this book is sort of a rip-off. Think before you buy."
1,Do you want a walkthrough of the whole game or most,"I regret bying this peice. I bought it right when fire red and leaf green first came out. It does not halve the complete walkthrough. It cuts out on the islands, only showing you three of the seven islands. I think it might not even tell you there are seven Islands.Nor does it mention anything about getting ho-hoh, lugia, or deoxys. if you get stuck there, you'd be screwed. you think they put in a few more pages to give you all of the game. by time i got to the end and did not have four islands, i was so mad. And their is a different book which did include them, from a different company. Spend your money on a better product. If you like the pokedex, than buy just a poke dex book."
3,"Good, but they lied","If you want to beat one of the pokemon gem games this is a necessity. They could have incuded more maps for dungons and gyms and such, and definatly should have included maps for the trick house. They don't even have a two on two battle strategy! Also, on the back cover it says they have locations for all the secret bases, but they lied! In the section where they said would have the locations, there is no mention of it. I have searched the book five times for this ""missing section"", and it does not exist. Truely, if you want an in-depth guide to training, breading, bases, contests, battle strategy, or anything besides maps and a pokedex, it would be wiser just to go to gamefaqs.com, they have 10 walkthroughs and many in-depth guides"
2,Disappointing,"Affixes to the phone case firmly, but it doesn't grip tightly enough to my pants pocket or belt. Often slips off, letting the phone fall to the ground, especially when getting out of the car and the seat belt scrapes the phone case. I quit using it and went back to the spring clip style."
1,Don't buy this,"This is my second Panasonic fax/answering machine. This one takes mediocrity to new levels. The feeder for outgoing faxes cannot take one page at a time and jams constantly. The film for incoming faxes runs out after 50 pages, and if you replace it with film made by anyone else, it will not work at all; Panasonic has built some sort of sensor in that is satsified only by genuine expensive Panasonic film replacement. On the plus side, the answering machine works. This machine is a POS. Spend the extra cash and get an inkjet, plain paper fax by a better manufacturer."
5,Excellent read,"I wasn't expecting this to be a scholarly work. And it shouldn't be. It is a good read about the women who made the bulk of the Raj. Most of the featured women travelled to India to be the wives of the officers and the soldiers and were known as the fishing fleet in those days. Author has collected data from these various women and combined to form a book which is historical as well as fascinating. For one, we know that most women got bored and wanted to eagerly return to England. But once they had done so they regretted ever returning! They missed all the servants and all the pomp which India had to offer. For most of these women could not have imagined such a life in their own homeland.Life in India among the officers was very much based on levels of authority. Such things were also kept in mind by their wives, if their husbands had to progress. Only the most eccentric or the daring or the rich could afford to forget these levels.A wonderfully evocative book."
4,A woman's lot throughout the British Raj,"Like 'em or loathe 'em, memsahibs played a vital role in the maintaining of the British Raj. This book is packed with first-hand accounts from letters and diaries, that ""tell it how it was"" - frightening or exhilarating, uncomfortable or exotic, depending on each woman's imagination and strength of character. Quotations (invariably hilarious or naive)from magazines, periodicals or ""How to ...."" manuals throw further light on the socially complex, often perplexing, but always busy lives that the women of the Raj had to live.My husband was a ""child of the Raj"" and in reading this to him he is reminded of so much in his early years.The photos add immensely to the author's picture of life then; snaps from family albums - all intimate and particular."
3,Diamonds among rhinestones,"It's worthwhile, and rather rewarding, to find here glimpes of the British Raj from this female-focused perspective. I'm happy to own and to have read this book. I would rate it higher were it not for some palpable excess of material that serves, in my view, only to dilute the better revelations."
5,Behind the couch,"I vividly remember watching this documentary when I was four, hiding behind the couch so my grandfather wouldn't see me and change the channel. It must have been rerun, because I was only two when it was first shown on PBS...After I saw it, I was afraid for a while that all radio towers had atomic bombs in them, like the tower at the Trinity site, and that they would be set off if there was a war. Not too bad an understanding of the Cold War, in fact!It told an engaging story; I remember rooting for the scientists during the bomb's construction, feeling excitement and dread at the test, and then horror at the aftermath of the attack on Hiroshima.I haven't seen it since (though it is on my wish list). However, the impression it made on me lasts to this day, and the more I learn, the better I realize this film was."
4,All students should learn to use this,"As a PhD-level contract research scientist, I use Reference Manager almost daily and am purchasing it for my undergrad son to use for his thesis at the U of Chicago. Once you get the ""hang"" of it, it saves countless hours in going back, trying to remember which reference you meant to cite--and you get your reference list instantly."
4,"I hate it, but it's better than EndNote","Not at all intuitive, but once you get rolling its OK. Not having a book included, or a good reference file really made for a pain to figure out the nuances, and I'm sure I underutilized, but in the end it did what I wanted. I remember Endnote being a bigger PAIN, and therefore RefMan11 wins for me."
3,Reference Manager in saved files,"While I am appreciating the power of this program to access and keep track of references, and its ease of use in citations, it is NOT user friendly for saving to disc, then accessing stored reference files."
3,Blowing Willow Wall Art,"The piece was the size I needed for the intended area on the wall. There were more colors than I anticipated; they were more of a southwestern theme. Nevertheless, the piece looks good on the wall."
3,Lamaze Play & Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Toy color is abundant, my baby love more , Can stimulate the baby's vision, hope the price able to have more discount !"
3,musical inchworm,"This lamaze toy looked like it would be smaller and actually do something. It is made of nice fabric but it was a dud with my 6 month old grand daughter who is not too critical, usually. She would rather bang a large plastic spoon!"
4,Bigger than expected,"I bought this for my one month old who wasnt interested until 6 weeks. Now she stares at it and seems to talk to it when I hang it on her bouncer toy bar.It is larger than I expected, I hope she will be more interested in the mirror and the teething function in a few months.If she shows more interest, I will then buy Jacques the peacock as well."
4,Cute,Entertains my grandson with a variety of textures and things to grasp combined in a relatively small toy. Great for the stroller or carseat.
4,as expected,Basic but fun. Bright colors and fun patterns and different textures to explore. Good basic for the stroller or car seat
5,Best baby toy out there.,"Read up on some child development books and you will find this well designed toy is a well researched toy that will stimulate an infant's brain. I have purchased many baby toys in my life. This toy is the best baby toy I have ever purchased. For less than $15, it is a steal. The five-star rating tells nothing but the truth."
4,Very Interactive! Too Bad It Can't Be Machine Washed...,"*** UPDATE APRIL 2011: I have machined washed this several times (line dried) and it still looks brand new. Nothing has torn off or faded. Happy Happy Joy Joy! ;)This is a visually beautiful and highly interactive rattle style toy. My daughter did not really take to it until she was 3 months old, though -- don't think newborns are going to get much out of this. She loves it now, however. The only con (my opinion) is that this is a cloth toy that cannot be submerged in water. It can only be surface wiped which I don't like for sanitary reasons... She is in teething mode and constantly putting it in her mouth. That said, it is a very nice interactive toy with lots to look at, touch, shake, squeeze and pull. The wings even make a crinkling/crackling noise somewhat similar to a potato chip bag. Interesting little toy."
4,Great baby toy,"I bought this for my baby. It's one of his favorite toys; he is constantly pulling at it and it occupies him for a good 30 minutes at a time before he falls asleep. The wings have a crinkly sound when touched, so it is entertaining for him as well. I have on occasion found his hand stuck in the round ring, but wasn't too concerned that it would harm him. I just bought another one of these as a baby shower gift!"
4,all the pretty colors,"These toys are great we have four of them. This one is still my babies favorite. She loves the wings, mirror, and crinkly stuff in the wings. The teether is a bit dangerous because it does swing....however she loves chewing on it and there is a pocket to store it safely. I think these toys are def worth the money."
3,Freddie the Firefly vs. Tucker the Turtle for a newborn,"I have both the firefly and the turtle. Both have pros and cons. I prefer the turtle because of the large mirror on his belly. My newborn has been fascinated with this since she was a month old. The firefly mirror on the wing is too small to interest her even though she is now 3 months old. However, the tangling teether from the firefly should come in handy in another month or two. If you were to buy only one Lamaze for a newborn, I recommend the turtle for its nice size mirror."
3,Great but...,"My 5 month old son loves this but with a week or so the red thing that hangs down came loose and could have choked him to death. Other than that, good product."
2,"Fun, but not made well",It is a fun toy but the head started coming off within only a week of owning. I had to sew it back on and so far it has been fine. My 6 month old enjoys chewing on this toy.
5,Cute Toy,"I bought this for my daughter before she was 2 months old. She stared and stared at it the first time I showed it to her. She loves to look at the colors on his wings and the back of his wings are black and white patterns, also very eye catching. Can't wait until she starts reaching out for him! One thing I like is he's small enough to toss in the diaper bag, too, but big enough to capture her attention. Very cute toy, but I probably would not buy any more of the Lamaze animal toys because of other reviews I have read that say they are all pretty much the same, so if you have one, you have them all."
5,Freddie is the best,My Child loved this from birth--- Freddie was attached to the my child's cart/bed in the hospital. On the opposite side of the colors is black and white which at birth made him focus on an object. This is still his favorite toy at 4 months of age. We just love Freddie and this is his only toy so far that if it was lost I would buy another really quick!
2,4 month old not interested,"My 4 month old has had this toy for 1 week now and still shows very little interest in it. She prefers her other musical and teething toys and blanket. Hopefully, she'll enjoy it at some point.The toy is a good size, bright colors, and has many different textures. The fabrics are not overly soft. This may contribute to her disinterest. From my observation, she still prefers simpler toys at this stage. And the look of this toy is very busy, with little to do (for a 4 month old) touch and mouth it."
5,Great Clip On Toy!,"After much research of such, I bought this clip on toy along with several others. Baby loved this toy from the start and has continued to play with it. This toy has grown with baby from infancy. It has many bright colors and makes noises when baby grasps or plays with it. It is easy to clean and has held up to alot of use. It goes every where with just a click! I'm glad I bought this toy!"
3,Good product but my baby wasn't intrested,"I bought 4 Lamaze toys based on their 5 stars reviews, Buzz the Bug, Freddie the Firefly, Mortimer the Moose, and Jacques the Peacock. They are all beautiful and good quality and all have teething rings, squeakers, crinkles, and rattles. BUT to be honest Jacques the Peacock beats them all so easily, my baby only cares about jack. When she was born I show her the High contrast Black and White dots on jack's wings, and she was so mesmerized for several minutes.. While I agree that all Lamaze baby products are good and worth buying, but I think 1 or 2 is enough."
3,love freddie!,"we love freddie and so does my daughter. she's had it since she was about 4 months old and is now 18 months. we keep it around just because, and she still plays with him every once in a while. it went everywhere with her when she was still an infant and she loved to stare at him."
5,"Jordan loves it, MeeMa!","My grandson is 4 months young, he has lots of toys. I had this shipped to him and he has not let go of it! This is great for his gums and color coordination. I am very pleased with it!"
5,What would we do without Freddie?,Freddie has been the absolute favorite toy in our house since she was 3 months old. Her eyes lit up the first time I picked him up and she hasn't tired of him one bit. She loves the crinkle wings and the black and white contrast on the back. The teether is great and the happy face gets kisses everyday. Thanks Lamaze for Freddie.
5,Best Ever!,"I have purchased many different ""take along"" toys, but this is by far my baby's favorite. He grabs the rings at the bottom when he is in his carseat. He also puts the other solid piece in his mouth while we are in the car. This is worth every penny and if you are on the fence about it, do not hesitate! It was worth it!"
5,New favorite toy!,This is my daughters new favorite. The toy is put together beautifully with bright colors and different textures on each wing.
4,great toy,This is a great toy for a baby. My son loves it. I have been giving it to him to play with since he was born. Each month he has discovered something new about the toy. I just bought it as a gift for my soon to be born niece.
5,From 3-6 months = Favorite Toy,This was a gift from his wise Grandma but dollar for dollar it's probably the best investment possible. Really great to keep babies occupied in the car!
5,My Baby's Best Friend,Freddie is my baby's best friend! She loves this firefly. He has so much going on it will give your baby at least an hour of fun everytime she picks him up. The lady bug pouch is the greatest treasure find. The squeaker toy is also a cool find they are not expecting.
3,okay.,nice x-mas gift but It could have came in some sort of box or packaging instead of a plastic bag....i had to find a box to wrap it in.
5,Four-month-old's favorite toy!,"Lamaze play and grow toys were on several lists of best toys for babies, so I decided to try this one with our four-month-old. He was drawn to it as soon as we took it out of the package, and he has gone crazy playing with it since we attached it to his activity gym. The firefly has all sorts of different textures and colors and is easy for him to grab and pull."
5,Great toy!!,It is larger then it looks in the pictures. It is very vibrant and high quality materiel. I highly suggest this toy.
5,Beautiful and entertaining.,My 5 months old really loved this from day one. He uses the red and orange circles as a teether and enjoyed the squishy sounds the wings make. The white circle is great to attach this to his car seat or stroller.
5,Lots to do!,"My son has had Freddy for quite some time but it has recently become a favorite (he is now 7 months). There are lots of things to chew on, the bug on the rope is always entertaining, and the legs and antennas are great for chewing/sucking on, fun crinkly sounds, squeaks, etc. Great toy!"
2,Great toy but is coming apart after just a month,"We got this toy as a gift from a friend. My friend ordered this toy from Amazon and it was shipped to our home directly. Within two weeks of getting this, it became my 2 month old's favorite toy. She kept playing with it all the time. Still, I'm giving it just 2 stars because it is of very low quality. In just a month 1/3rd of the stitching around the squeaker has come off. Now it has become a choking hazard. The squeaker is ready to fall out. It is very disappointing and scary too. How can they compromise on quality in toys for babies?"
3,"I like it, but him? Not so much.","It's an adorable toy, but my baby nephew ( when he was less than a year old) didn't go gaga over it. Oh well. Can't predict what a baby would like at that age. It'll be a hand-me-down toy when I have kids. Great craftsmanship and fast shipping. Maybe I should chew on it a bit and enjoy it myself."
3,mom of 5 month old,this item is bigger than it looks so I can't really hang it on my sons bouncer mobile thing. it does have lots of different parts that are more interesting to him the older that he gets...but it is just a little big for him...he loves to teethe on it but it isn't his favorite toy.
1,My 7 month old girl does NOT like this toy.,My 7 month old girl does NOT even touch this toy. She NEVER play with this for 3 months. What A waste.
1,Shame on Lamaze.....,"It is disgraceful to find that almost everything is made in China. The Chinese have such a horrible track record in their manufacturing protocol; I would even go as far as to say they have a total disregard for the safety and integrity of their products.the import to the U.S.I wasn't expecting this from the Lamaze company, and am very disappointed to discover that these cute critters like Freddie the Firefly are possibly compromised. Lamaze should know that toys for babies must have impeccable safety safeguards."
5,freddie's my baby's fave,"freddie's the perfect lamaze toy there is! barely can't put it down. he's awesomely cute and wonderful! my baby's 1 year old now, and she loves it still :)"
5,Baby's Obsession,"This was the first toy our daughter even cared to look at or reach for. She LOVES this thing! She has played with it every day for the past 3-4 months, I'd say (she's just over 5 mos old now). I keep thinking she'll get sick of it, but she doesn't! She loves putting the wings in her mouth and the crinkly noises they make. I'm planning to get her another Lamaze toy for our next plane trip to keep her entertained. Lamaze stuff is so cute, and the quality is excellent."
5,Awesome toy!,My daughter got this for Christmas when she was 4 months old and she really took to it in the last 2 months. It is without a doubt her favorite toy. The colors are vibrant and she loves all the textures. It's easy for her to pick up and go back and forth between her hands. I would highly recommend this to any parent looking for a great toy for their little one.
5,Awesome Line by Lamaze,"I love this line of colorful hanging toys by Lamaze. All the different textures and colors really grab a baby's attention. I ordered several and they are my daughter's favorite. I think the price is great, too, especially compared to some of the other toys that can be affixed to carseats and bouncers. Highly recommend!"
