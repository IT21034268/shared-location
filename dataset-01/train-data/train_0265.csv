2,Hado,Did not understand this process. Perhaps another book explaining this book and how and why it supposedly works.
4,Healing Power of Hado,book was a gift for My grandson overseas who advises me it was exactly as wanted in as new condition
5,the 2nd best from Asmith,"The follow-up to their monster Toys album.Was their 2nd best album (Toys 1st). It was all downhill after Rocks. They are an average band now, but they did have their moment & what a moment...TOYS AND ROCKS..support your favorite artists."
5,ROCKS: Review Number 50!!!!!!,"ROCKS is one of, if not THE greatest American hard rock albums of all time. P>Like the diamonds on it's cover, ROCKS is classy, hard and incredibly dense. As one of the previous reviewers stated, it's not so much the excellence of each individual track but the way in which they combine to create a phenomenal album experience.On that point, I'd like to defend the album's closing cut ""Home Tonight"". Many reviewers here seem to feel that ""Home Tonight"" is a weak link on the album, but I must disagree. True, it's not a ""heavy"" song per se, but it's not supposed to be. ""Home Tonight"" is the sound of the album closing, a sad, romantic and haunting afterthought. Listening to it, you almost feel as if the album is ""saying goodbye"" to you. It's a perfect ending to an absolutely perfect album."
5,Some of the best of AEROSMITH!,"This album is sure platinum. Steve Tyler's song writing techniques are great. ""Home Tonight"", ""Back in the Saddle"", ""Last Child"", ""Sick as a Dog"" are the best songs off the album. Buy this album and it will make your life a breeze."
4,Amazing Vocals,"This accurately titled release ""Rocks"" from the first blood curdling Steven Tyler scream of ""Back In the Saddle"". Thunderous guitar duals between Joe Perry and Brad Whitford dominate the entire disk. There are funky chops and synchopated bass lines by Tom Hamilton on ""Last Child"", another tune where Tyler's vocals are desparate wails. ""Rats in the Cellar"" is a quick tempo rocker with a catchy chorus. ""Sick As a Dog"" is another Aerosmith classic, with their trademark harmonies and a great guitar tone for both players. ""Get the Lead Out"" is another funky riff with crisp power chords and strong vocals. This is another strong release by Aerosmith that is very enjoyable. Get it!!!"
5,Truth in advertising,"I'll preface this review by admitting that I'm not a hardcore Aerosmith fan. I only own three of the many albums in their catalog and it's only their music from the seventies that really moves me. However, almost thirty years after I first heard it as a young boy, this album remains one of my favorites by any artist! Back In The Saddle gets things off with bang and the band never lets up until the end. The songwriting, production and incendiary performances all ""come together"" to deliver the perfect blend of hooks and sleazy power. This record is criminally underrated and ranks with the best of Zeppelin, The Who, The Stones, and whoever else you'd care to include. Whenever I'm in the mood to crank it up to eleven, this is usually the first album I reach for."
1,listen to new aerosmith.. its better!,"thank god for good songs like ""hole in my soul"" and ""jaded"" because these old cds are really boring. its not aerosmiths true rootsfor good aerosmith listen to hokin on the hobo"
1,"A more fitting album title than ""Rocks"" would have been ""Sucks""","Don't waste your time on this one. It was one of their early cds from when they still hadn't perfected their songwriting craft. It's really just a bunch of screaming and noise. It makes a gg allin record sound like Emerson Lake and Palmer by comparison. If you want to hear some good aerosmith I recommend Get A Grip or the Armageddon soundtrack, so you can experience the classics like ""I Don't Wanna Miss a thing"" and ""Crazy Amazing Crying Crazy"" If there was a zero stars rating, believe me this worthless album would get it. I want my 12 dollars back steve perry! >:("
1,Bad Bad Bad CD From Aerosmith!,"Uhhhhh! This is a really irritating album, oh my god, there areno good songs on this CD. This CD is really lame! Probably theworst studio album of all time by any rock band next to theAC/DC CDs. I hate this CD, want Aerosmith really bad, go buythis, Pump, and Big Ones for really bad Aerosmith music.People who said that this album was great needs may haveto go listen to music like women's. That's not true, stayaway."
4,The best of the old stuff,This should be the crown jewal of your Aerosmith Classic collection.If you like the classic stuff and don't have any start with this one.
4,Aeronsmiff,"Aerosmith was gargantuan at this time. Stadiums. If you were around then, you know that everyone had the first 4 albums. Classics all. If you don't know or think aerosmith is some newer band, you must pick up their first 4 records to ""get it"". Timeless."
4,Good one,I think Toys in the Attic/Honkin on Bobo/Aerosmith/PermanentVacation are better....But this one is pretty good. Sick as aDog was my favorite from this Album.
5,They named it right!,"This is the hardest rocking Aerosmith album ever. Every song is a gem and holds up well after 24 years. If you could only have one album by the band Aerosmith this should be the one. It does not have the hits of Pump or Get A Grip but it is better. This is the band before drugs destroyed them yet after they got their musical legs firmly under them. Good to see that Aerosmith has pulled it together for the last 13 years, lets hope they ride tall in the saddle for many more years!"
3,IT ROCKS !! BUT NOT SO MUCH....,"IT's good AEROSMITH, much better than the ""ARMAGGEDON"" days Aerosmith... That doesn't mean this album is so perfect."
2,Throw me a bone!,"This album comes on like an eager puppy, with Nat's cheerful cornet and the slightly cheesy funkiness of the Three Sounds. Only tenor sax Rottweiler Johnny Griffin turns up the ferocity a little, but, alas, he doesn't play on every track. And then there's the, um, small matter of this album's desecratory treatment of Monk's ""Well You Needn't"". Nat decides to speed up and simplify the melody, losing an enormous amount of what makes this Monk tune harmonically interesting, and then sets the head to a Latin beat. He might have actually pulled this concoction off if the entire piece had stayed in Latin rhythm, but the musicians immediately takes the easy way out, shifting to standard jazz time for the soloing and thereby turning a Monk classic into a characterless vehicle for ""blowing"". With that, this one goes straight to the dog house."
3,Ambivalent...,"As an African American quilter, I had mixed feelings about this book. While I felt that the quilt projects were beautiful and the book itself interesting, I felt a little cheated when I realized that the authors were not of African heritage themselves. I know that shouldn't make a difference, that Africa was their inspiration and inspiration is neither inclusive nor exclusive, but I was still disappointed. There is a rich African and African American quilting tradition out there. Please look to those books for inspiration as well."
1,Poor quality.,"The moment they arrived I put them on and wore them around the house. 5 minutes later, the heel broke. Poor quality of shoe, but very cute. I'm bummed because they are new and now I have to take them in and pay more to have them repaired. Booo.."
4,Kickass Rock,"I had never heard of the band but bought this one form a discount rack only because the band name is the same as the famous Nazareth Album.This album turned out to be great and with the first track 'Cadillac Jack' I knew that I had landed myself a real gem.The band is hard, raunchy with guitar licks and riffs and a singer who sings and dosn't gurggle as most rock singers do today thanks to the impact of Kurt Cobain (too many artists copy his style today).'Whisky Tango' 'Alone' 'Southern Cock' 'Stomp' are all great rock songs that will linger with you for a long time.There is a great rock anthem in 'The party ain't over'.This is one album where all the songs are worth liseninig to so you will not need to skip songs.I am tempted to give the album 5 stars but refrain as for a 5 star the album needs to sustain my listening onslaught for at least 6 months.If you like good raunchy straight hard rock bands, don't think twice buy HOTD and you won't be disappointed."
5,A breath of fresh air for rock n' roll!,"Before buying this CD, I had only heard about this band from friends and from reading magazines. So I took a shot in the dark and hit a bullseye! This is one of the best rock albums I've heard in years - no trendy stuff, just straight up rock. Some of the highlights include the opener ""Cadillac Jack"", ""Whiskey Tango"", ""As I Am"", ""Southern Cock"", ""Killin' Heart"" and ""The Party Ain't Over"", which has become a personal anthem of mine. Check this one out, you'll be glad you did!"
4,FULL SESSION,"This is the full MOST MUCH session from 10/61. The tracks I Love You and Sonny Boy were not on the original LP. There inclusion here increases the playing time to 50 min. The 9 min. version of Robbin's Nest was always my favorite. On Autumn Leaves pianist Hugh Lawson plays the melody and Jimmy comes in later. The title tune is a groover too. Tommy Potter is on bass, Clarendon Johnson on drums and Ray Barretto supplies the mild congas as he did for Gene Ammons."
5,Great Book,"What a very good book, it doesn't show every painting in the different series but you get to see most of them. Unfortunately it only covers his work up to 2004 and not to date, but still a brilliant book."
5,Art work,"I viewed this book personally in the UK where I live and since my daughter is a big fan of Vettriano, I purchased this book as a present for her. It shows the various aspects of Jack Vettriano's work, both the well known (printed on cards) and the not well known. It is very insightful of the different sides of a wonderful artist, and his work is well represented."
4,Great Way to get to know this artist,"I liked the book from the first moment. Some of the most famous pictures and my personal favourites come together in this book in a quite nice way.However the book had a scratch on the front cover and I expected it to be a littler larger than an A4 size rather than smaller.Apart from that I liked the book and the handling by Amazon, since the book arrived nearly 2 weeks earlier as expected."
4,the singing waiter,care should be taken as to the age of the purchaser of this book. some images are close to being pornographic. take care that it does not get into the hands of the young.
3,Go for the older cheaper one,Nothing special about it. Save your money and buy the original one for much cheaper.
4,xmas present,xmas present for my husband. ask me after xmas. cheryle mezzano I definitely enjoyed the movie...have watched it many times!!!!!
3,"Cheap Trick again! The soundtrack is better than the Boys Life style movie that Herr Cruise, the...","scientologist plays in! Cruise cocky smile, that onlybrainwashed women like, is an average actor and thedeceased 'Goose' steals the show. Is that why HE HADto be KILLED off?! Great soundtrack, especially CheapTrick, with their last single done with Jon B Branton Bass before the record company forced him out...[Jonny, We Hardly Knew Ye...]Great pics on the 45,7"" single. Look for it on amazon or alaibris or inyour local vinyl shop while you can. The good old daysof Cheap Trick!"
1,Super Audio CD???,"Thought this was just an extended Top Gun soundtrack with ""You've Lost that Loving Feeling,"" ""Great Balls O Fire,"" etc., but turns out this is some strange Super CD format that none of my players or computers support. Never heard one track off this CD and although it is my fault for buying it and I should have returned the CD I have no idea what would play this CD. I think the entire format was dead before I ever ordered this thing."
2,Meh,I only found 2 songs I actually liked in this whole album the rest were forgettable and just plain boring from what I remember so I just wasted my money and could have just purchased the two songs I wanted in the first place.
5,Top Gun,Needed this soundtrack to put with a photographic audio visual presentation. Turned out brilliantly. Love the movie and the music that goes with it.
5,A must have,"Not only did the anthem win a grammy, many thanks to Steve STevens(probably the best underrated guitarist). but the soundtrack has all the essentials. its a great cd to have and you can sing along to all the songs"
5,Unbéle,"This is a high quality soundtrack to say the least. If you're a fan of 80s music, by all means buy this album. You know a great album when every single song is good. All of the tracks are good and none need to be skipped. I always keep this CD in reach when driving, it's probably one of my top three favorite albums. So if you like 80s music, or like to get nostalgic about the 80s and/or Top Gun, this is the CD for you."
4,It is a good CD,"This CD had some great music, but some songs just didn't float my boat. However, if you like fast paced music or slow love songs, you should listen. It has the extremes of both."
3,disappointing,"SACD sounds good on front speakers - I cannot find a review that states rear speakers are not used - good sound, extra tracks, but not enough to warrant SACD status - I wish reviewers would review music quality - everyone should already be familiar with songs"
3,Varying quality,"1980's music has not dated gracefully compared to other decades but despite the age of the Top Gun Soundtrack, there are still a few good songs on it. Berlin's Take My Breath Away, which features prominently in the movie, is easily the most remembered but Might Wings by Cheap Trick is also very good as is Sittin' on the Dock of a Bay by Otis Reding. The rest of songs range from OK (Destination Unknown) to poor (Heaven in Your Eyes). The clear winner for me is the Top Gun Anthem. If I had to compile a playlist of 'motivational/inspirational songs' the anthem would certainly be included.Darkhorse86"
1,Top of the class???,Der!!!!It says on the front in big bold letters. 'Music from and Inspired by'.Top marks to anyone who bought it and found it wasn't exactly the soundtrack.
1,Not what you'd expect to bear the Cuisinart name,"Does a very nice job of making popcorn as long as you follow the directions and have quick reflexes. When the popping stops, don't hesitate.But ... after half a dozen batches, the machine quit working. Apparently the heating element wore out. The person at the 1-800 number confirmed that seemed to happen a lot. In other words, Cuisinart appears to know that the thing is a piece of junk. They say they're going to send us another one -- as soon as we decide whether to pay the postage for it."
1,great popcorn! awful quality,"This newer model is vastly improved over the previous one which we had to replace three times on the warranty. HOWEVER, there is a part on it inside that breaks VERY easily if you don't install the plate on the base VERY carefully. The first one broke and was replaced. I only used the second one 3 or 4 times before it broke in exactly the same way.Their warranty service is very disatisfactory. We have had to pay for each replacement at $10 a pop plus the return shipping of the defective units.All in all, we have paid an amount equivalent to at least two units and cannot get a replacement without paying more. :-(I LOVE the popcorn this popper makes. It is a GREAT idea! Just wish the quality were better and that the company did not make you pay to get replacements."
1,I give up!,"I first purchased the Cuisinart Popcorn Maker about a year ago, and we really liked it for popping one or two bowls, but when we started having ""movie night"" with our four grandchildren, it would overheat before we could make enough to go around. Then about a month ago, we were trying to make popcorn when the heating unit burned out. I thought this was a fluke, so I ordered a second one. This time we couldn't even get the machine to heat up enough to pop one bowl. This popper cost way too much to be so difficult and unreliable. I do not recommend it."
1,Broke after 6 months,"I got this popper for Christmas because my old hot air popper blew kernels everywhere. Now this $50 popcorn popper has busted. Something broke internally and the electrical contacts don't...well contact. Plus I always hated cleaning it because it gets this burnt oil film on it that won't come off. On top of that, you have to run multiple batches because it won't make very much without getting all bogged down. I guess money can't buy a good popcorn popper. Back to microwave."
3,Cuisinart EasyPop Popcorn Maker,"I purchased this popcorn maker as my friend recommended it. I love popcorn and could eat it everyday, however the way I like it is with lots of butter and junk. He suggested I try this maker as you use very little oil and basically its air popped. Reducing calories I like. However I was not completely pleased with the consistency of the popcorn. Slightly rubbery and dry but I guess that's why this machine is a healthier choice. Its very easy to use, easy to clean and I believe right for the money I paid for it. I will get used to the taste - but expected a more theatre like popcorn taste. Overall happy with the purchase."
1,Didn't last long,"There is 3 basic pieces to this unit. There is a base unit that has the power cord. There is a middle piece that has the heating element and stir mechanism and the cover. I really liked the design, however on the second use I plugged the middle piece into the base and broke the protective cover that keeps someone from sticking there fingers onto the power connectors. Seems like a bad design. The ability to separate pieces and wash them was appealing. Would not recommend this unit."
1,Where's the popcorn?,"I received this popper as a Christmas gift. I was very excited until I tried to use it only to find that it popped about 10 kernels of corn and that was it!So I thought it must be the popcorn. I tried another new brand of popcorn and only got another disappointing performance; no kernels popped at all. I read and reread the directions as did my mother and my husband. It just didn't work. I'm really disappointed and wondering after reading all the mixed reviews if I should even try another Cuisinart. I love all my other Cuisinart products, what happened to this one?? I called the customer service number but only got a recording to try another number which gave me a recording concerning a phone call service????!!! I'll try to return the machine to Dillard's today."
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited to have gotten this as a gift.. The first 3 times I used it, everything turned out great and I loved the popcorn. I used 'popcorn oil' from the market. The 4th time I went to make popcorn (all within the same week) I went to lift the base of and the lever to one of the handles snapped. Well, it still worked, but I returned it to the store knowing that the other lever would most likely break as well and I wanted to get it back within the return policy time limits..Disappointed..."
2,Not very durable,My wife and I were satisfied with the popcorn taste and overall were quite pleased...until one of the internal plastic parts broke and the oil pan would no longer sit on the base properly and heat up. This happened after only 7 months and no more than 25 uses. Not worth the relatively steep price. And of course the store where we bought it (Linens and Things) is now out of business...
3,Needs better craftsmanship,"I am not thrilled with this. The latch on both sides have broken off, for seemingly no reason at all. We can still use it, but we have to put something heavy on the top to hold it down. Other then that the unit works just fine. Purchased it for my wife, because she hates to make popcorn on the stove. Me, I still do it that way, less hassle I feel. But she is happyish with this (with the broken latches she is less happy)"
2,unhappy,"We were happy with the way the Easy Pop Popcorn maker made popcorn! Delicious! However, after just a few times of using the product the warming plate handles broke. Not just one, but both handles. We have only had it for 3 months. Used less than a dozen times. Would not recommend this product."
1,Poor construction,Used it about 3 times. Worked great until I tried to make a 4th. Heating element stopped working.......waste of money!
2,Paid for the cuisinart name but did not receive the expected cuisinart quality!,"I purchased the Cuisinart Easy Pop popcorn popper for my husband for Christmas. With the name cuisinart you expect it to be top of the line in quality. He loved it's ease of use and the popcorn's flavor. Two weeks after using it for the first time the lock on the right handle broke. There are two locks, one on the right and one on the left.The locks keep the clear bowl in place while popping. Now when in use the right hand side of the clear bowl raises and lowers as the popcorn is popping. All in all he does like the design and I like the look of the stainless and black in my stainless kitchen."
2,"Made good popcorn, but ours died after a year",This popper worked much better than the stir crazy. Unlike the stir crazy it would consistently pop hull-less kernels. However it cracked at the base plate after about a year. Quite annoying. I like the stirring popper concept...
1,"Love Cuisinart, just not this item","Got this as a wedding gift and used it about 3 times before the heating element broke. Cost to cross ship is more than just getting a new unit. Keep shopping, this is NOT the popcorn maker you're looking for."
2,Half the time doesn't work,"First of all, be aware that oil is required so you don't burn the popcorn. Second of all, half the time it never gets around to popping the popcorn. It seems to have a faulty heating mechanism. I'm buying a different brand today, I'm very disappointed in this item."
4,Better than microwave popcorn,"This is my first Amazon review - hope you find it helpful! I purchased this unit in white, and am enjoying it so far. It is easy to use - simply add a couple of tsp. of oil and popcorn measured using the supplied 2/3 cup measure, turn on, and wait. The unit stirs the popcorn to ensure even cooking and pops quickly. I have used it about six times so far, and am pleased. I have not had any of the unpopped corn that another reviewer complained of - maybe it has to do with the type of popcorn being used? One thing you do have to watch is that once the popcorn is done, remove it from the machine quickly, or it will burn. Most importantly for me, cleanup is easy. Both the bucket and hotplate are dishwasher safe, and the plate has a non-stick coating that makes it easy to wipe clean. Several reviewers have complained about durability - my machine has no problems yet, and I hope it stays that way. All in all I am enjoying this as a big improvement over microwave popcorn."
3,Could Be Better,"I was dissapointed with the performance of this popper. I thought by buying a product from Cuisinart it would be the best of the best,sadly it's not. Works adequately clean up is perfect though."
4,"Love it, but have to replace it","Love love love this popcorn maker! popcorn is fresh and fluffy. The plastic container that the popcorn pops into is a little hard to clean, best for using the dishwasher. The little clips that attach the top to the bottom have both ""disappeared"" and it no longer pops correctly...takes a long time. plan on replacning it and trying again, being more careful lifting the top off. hope the 2nd one works better."
3,whats all the hiip about,"you have to experiment with the popcorn maker to really find that happy meduim thats going to suite to tastes, just right amount of oil and seasoning makes a good theatre style popcorn.but never cook more than the recommmended quanity always use the proper measurings of popcorn, but your able to ajust measuring of seasoning and oil oh and it will burn your popcorn always stay with it till done popping is finished and turn over popcorn maker as soon as its finished popping so it won't burn i give this item a 2 and 1/2 stars."
2,WAY TOO MUCH WORK FOR POPCORN!,WHEN WE FIRST GOT THIS POPCORN POPPER WE STRUGGLED TO FIGURE OUT HOW THE HECK TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND WHEN WE FINALLY GOT IT IT MADE PRETTY DECENT POPCORN. BUT IT IS VERY HARD TO TURN IT UPSIDE DOWN TO GET THE POPCORN INTO THE LID AND IT SPILLS EVERYWHERE. AND WHEN YOU ARE READY TO MAKE IT AGAIN YOU HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO GET THE GROOVES IN THE SIDE OF THE BASE LINED UP WITH THE TOP AND WE COULD NOT GET IT ON AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES. MY HUSBAND GOT SO FRUSTRATED HE THREW IT OUT! NOW WE JUST USE A POT AND LID!
1,Horrible product,"This is a horrible product. We used it once. Two days later, the pieces would not fit together properly."
1,Worst. Popcorn. Popper. Ever.,"I've decided recently to not eat microwave popcorn (too salty and buttery to me) and went back to popping it on the stove top. Not wanting to needlessly put wear and tear on my ceramic stove, I purchased this popper.First time I used it the popcorn was tough to chew. The whole thing was a pain in the butt to clean also, I mean why make the bowl so intricate? It's like cleaning a bundt pan each time you want popcorn!I use powdered seasoning and it all goes on the sides of the bowl instead of the popcorn. I even tried transferring it to another bowl and putting the seasoning on that way - still went everywhere but the popcorn.I just popped some on the stove, and it's delish! This popper is going back. For $[...], I expected way more than what Cuisinart delivered."
1,Poor design,The design is wrong.Steams the popcorn.Not very well made.Just threw it away after the unit finally packed up altogether.
1,messy,"While I liked the final product, I could never clean the plastic bowl. It had a permanent stickyness to it, like the oil adhered to it. It just got too sticky and messy so I tossed it. Also, the bowl got moist during popping which made some of the popcorn a little soggy on one side."
1,Older Model of This Popper,We have an older model of this popper that does NOT have a removable lid on top and it makes terrible popcorn. I think this is the model that people are complaining about. It is very chewy. Perhaps this new improved model works better but I am afraid to try.
1,Cuisin-Junk!,"First time my wife accidentally knock it off the dinning room table to the wooden floor a height of 29"", not even three feet the plastic around the base shattered and one of the handels broke off making the unit useless! I brought this for my family for Christmas and used it only about five times! Don't waste your money! I have a cheap Black&Decker Hot air popper for years that I moved with abused and dropped many times and still runs great!(only makes enough for one person at a time,though)I wish I could give it less than one star! They need to go back to the drawing table and use impact resistant plastics and do more rigorous drop testing to make sure it holds together if it accedentally dropped from your average height kitchen table or counter onto a wooden or tile floor!"
1,Terrible Quality,I have had two of these and that's it. Both Broke. Terrible construction and product quality - not at all worthy of the Cuisinar brand name. Don't waste your money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"Depending upon how often you utilize the appliance, you will eventually find that the handles that connect the heating plate to the base break. Once they break, it renders the applicance completely unfunctional. For a Cusinart product, they need to fix this quality issue ASAP; especially considering the amount of money paid for the item."
3,Makes Great popcorn but...,"I bought the CPM-900 in December 2009. This machine makes really good popcorn. It's also easy to clean as the popping chamber & hotplate are easily washed in the dishwasher. I just wish it would last. After one year, the handles clipped away and the hotplate stirring mechanism quit. Cuisinart replaced the hotplate twice, then on the third time I called, they argreed to replace the entire unit under the condition that there can be no further warranty claims. I agreed. This replacement unit is chipping away and has lost it's ability to pop all kernels so it's being retired. Two machines in a period of just over three years seems a little inconvenient and expensive. I need to find a more practical solution."
1,Defective Popcorn Maker,"Cuisinart seems to be making defective popcorn makers. My first one died, I had it replaced and then the second one died. Cuisinart products don't seem to have the level of quality they used to. Don't waste your money."
1,WHAT A BUMMER,I was so excited when I got this. I love old school popcorn. It worked once and that was it
1,Poor Product,Uhgg! First use I only got one batch of popcorn popped and the popcorn popper over heated. What a disappointment on family movie night.
1,5 stars till it broke :(,This was a wonderful machine until the cheap plastic connectors for the heating element broke. It lasted for about 4 months 2-3 times a week usage. I've gone back to the stove top hand crank that has lasted for 12 years now.
2,Dont Bother,Used this for four months all was pretty good. My son dropped the cover and it cracked and broke in half. So cheaply made! The bottom heating element part was almost burnt to death. Popcorn wasn't that great. It did work pretty good at first. Waste of money.
1,TERRIBLE!! DON'T BUY IT!!!,"I was thrilled when I found this item, however, ended up being very disappointed. When I would flip the unit over after popping, the bottom would come apart from the heating element. I've even had some of the hot oil land on the element and catch fire. The popcorn was tuff and dry tasting. Stir Crazy is a much better choice!! Save your money. I too thought this name brand would be top notch. WRONG!"
1,Dangerous design,"This popcorn maker does some things well, but the flip design requires that you flip it over to get the popcorn out. The first time I did this, my hand slipped and it burned my thumb pretty badly (blister) in about 2 seconds. I'd consider this design flaw extreme, and wouldn't recommend people, especially kids, use this maker."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE,"I purchased this popcorn popper because I was under the impression that Cuisinart was a dependable name for appliances. This popcorn stopped working after about 10 uses. The heating element failed. Everything else works - the spinner, etc. This was my second popper after exchanging it for the exact same reason."
1,Worst popcorn ever,"My sweet husband got me this for my birthday as he knows how much I love popcorn (Orville). The first batch hardly popped and burned. The second batch did better but had small kernals without the fluffy pop and it tasted like cardboard and was not ""crunchy"" as advertised. Had to put so much butter on it that it was probably much less healthy than Orville. Do not get this if you are a lover of fluffy tasty popcorn (it is a snack you know)."
2,No pop for the buck,This machine is great looking and good concept but not worth the money. I was able to use the popper 2 times then it no longer heated. The top was pretty but not easy to clean. The heating element was easy to remove and clean but it seems there is a problem getting it seated correctly. I will go with a cheaper version.
3,It's alright,"My unit has been used 6 times or so with no issues. I haven't had the issues setting it up that people talk about. The popcorn is good, I'm still tweaking my proportions of corn and oil. Popcorn popped this way tastes/feels slightly less dry than microwave or air-popped corn. I also think the ""bowl"", the big clear container on top is to blame for too much moisture remaining. Despite the vents at the top, mine gathers significant condensation inside while popping, and that moisture just gets the popcorn damp when emptying it. I don't eat out of the bowl either, it's really not ideal for serving because of the vents and the cover fits loosely as stated elsewhere.I haven't had the quality issues, but I purchased at Costco where there is a very liberal return policy, so I'm not worried."
1,Cuisinart Popper= junk!,"I bought this just a few months ago, and used it 5 times maybe and already its broken. There is a small black piece on the base and when you put the popping bowl into place it should move well one time it didn't and the black part broke and although the popcorn maker's mixing arm still works it won't heat up. While they are sending me a replacment judging by the reviews it won't be any different. The popcorn is tough as well very crunchy."
1,Horrible! Used once & it stopped working,"horrible. Wouldn't recommend getting one of these. Get a reg air popper that's more reliable.Motor stopped working after almost popping one bucket. I would've taken it back to where I bought it, but I had bought it months earlier.I love Cuisinart....but I'd stay away from this item!"
4,EasyPop Popcorn Maker,Easy to use & easy cleanup.Works well with different gourmet popcorn to make that rented movie more like an in theater experience.
1,The biggest disapoinment ever,I only used this poper 3 times and the inside fell apart .it does not heat up nor does the stir spin.Of course I ordered it online and to return it would make it even more exspensive.I am giving it 1 star but I don't really think I should.
2,Revised CPM-800,"The older model CPM-800 was the predecessor to this machine. The one GLARING fault in that machine was a lack of vents in the popping bowl. This resulted in steamed popcorn, making most of the product unusually tough, and some very soggy pieces mingled in.The CPM-900 addresses that issue with a heavily perforated bottom and a slip on cover.I would ask those that experienced plastic taste and ""dense"" popcorn, did you leave the ""cover"" on? I wouldn't assume they did, but that would guarantee the results listed.I can't imagine how the 800 unit ever made it into production with such an obvious fault, which leads me to believe Cuisinart quality is no longer a priority. Judging by the other reviews I'd say that they may have missed on the CPM-900 series as well, despite singly addressing the biggest issue.The ""bucket included"" idea is a nice one, but in the end these models simply encourage steam buildup, which prevents good results."
4,Good Popcorn!,"UM... I have read all the comments and I have to say I was a little scared cause I read the comments after I purchased my machine before it came to the house. All I have to say is what is wrong with you folks? Ramming pieces together and jamming stuff...I guess if you have trouble seeing or you are a gorilla with huge hands...you may have a problem operating this machine! LOL.... There is nothing wrong with this machine... the arm looks a little flimsy but honestly if you break the arm you are a mess it's not made out of tissue paper! I think that the popcorn it makes is very crispy and very good consistancy, and until I get the popcorn I ordered online I am using microwave popcorn warmed in the microwave for 35 seconds so that the butter melts down...and it's still great! I also put my parts in the dishwasher...they came out great.... if you are very clumsy or have 5 thumbs on your hand dont get this one...LOL"
1,Poor Value,"After less than a dozen uses, the machine failed completely. It never did pop all the corn, and what did pop was worse than microwave corn. Attempts to contact Cuisinart were in vain. No replies to email or telephone."
1,This is a poor quality product,"Purchased one of these and it is a piece of junk. Definitely NOT worth $60. We didn't even have the styrofoam off of it and it was already broken. This was a gift for my son and he dropped it onto a carpeted floor from about 3 feet whilst trying to get it out of the box. The thing (heat plate) was cracked into five pieces. We were able to repair it at that time but now the base is also broken. The base inside has several delicate, flimsy parts which break. This machine is NOT durable by any stretch of the imagination. You also can get almost no parts for it."
2,simple is better,"Yes, it pops corn, nothing to right home though.it harder to clean, with it Fluted serving bowl,and base.i went back to using an ordinary pot, lid, bowl, and found i liked it better.the clean up was easier. For instance if i want a single serving of pop corni pick a small 1 quart pot. and a small serving bowl, and you are in business.when the popping was done, i just dump it into the bowl, add salt to popcornif i wanted to add butter, I just put the butter into the already warm empty pot to melt it and pour it over my popcorn.the small pot and bowl turns out to be a lot easier to clean,and makes popcornjust as good, if not better and you don't have to worry it someday breaking.a pot and lid will last a lifetime. No electronics or moving parts.simple is better."
1,Third time is not a charm,I initial thought that the first one I got was a dud. I got a second one and that too was a dud. I am now on my third and yet again it too has failed. On each one the clips on the handles on the base break off after a month or two of use and then the heating element starts to fail as well. This is a very poor design and should be avoided
1,Avoid this popper,"Got the popper as a gift. We have tried everything to get it to make descent popcorn. Always smells like it's burnt, and has a plastic stink. Tried evry kind of popcorn, same result. Went back to our air popper. Store this one in the basement and maybe regift to someone I don't like.Cuisinart CPM-900 EasyPop Popcorn Maker, Red"
2,Over Priced/Over Valued,"Got this machine this past year and with alot of discounts paid around $42. Never put in dish washer. The top lid did not hold up after a few weeks,which makes it tricky to turn over when finished. One fall resulted in a side tab breaking that holds the unit on the base. This could be ""operators"" error but the plastic tab is not very strong for the long haul. And its hard to get a large batch as they recommend a 3rd cup. Overall, its nice looking and I thought it would do a good job...I gave up on air poppers and will try the Stir Crazy. (Orville Redenbacker has a similar unit and it was $19.00 during Black Friday) Lots of money for a below average popper."
2,Not the Cuisinart quality that you'd expect,"Both plastic tabs on the heating surface broke within the first few uses. We didn't hassle with the time and expense for a return because it's clearly a really poor overall design. You'll pay a premium price to get the Cuisinart name. But, you won't get the Cuisinart quality that used to be expected. I've now been burned on two different Cuisinart products in a row. Their quality isn't what it used to be."
1,Too time consuming,"My biggest beef with the Cuisinart EasyPop is the cleanup.Unless you have a really good dishwasher and you use it daily, you'll have to wash the bowl out by hand if you want to use it frequently.If you have hard water as I do, you'll have to dry the bowl out by hand, unless you don't mind spots on your clear plastic bowl. And a machine as pretty as this isn't one that I'd want to hide in a cupboard if I didn't have to.The drying process isn't quick and simple as it would be with a rounded surface. The ups and downs in this bowl require a bit of extra effort to get it clear and dry.If you have the time and don't mind doing a bit of extra cleanup, this may be a fine popcorn maker for you. But for me, with a large family, we don't have time for it.We're taking this thing back to the store and will continue to use our good ol' hot air popper we picked up at a thrift store years ago for a couple bucks."
1,Popcorn machine started on fire minutes after taking out of box and plugging in.,"Took out of box, plugged in, and within seconds machine started on fire. Complete junk not to mention a total hazard."
1,Abnsolute garbage,"I've been through three of these and they all have broken. Two of them had the retaining clips break off (during normal and proper use Mr. 'everyone but me is using it wrong', trust me, by now, his broke too). Two also lost heat to the element. Two of the plastic housings around the heating element cracked and broke just from being heated then cooling and heating again. I mean who surrounds a heating element with plastic that can't hold up to heat differential?!?!? Expected MUCH more from Cuisinart.It had such potential.Concept: 9Execution: 1"
1,Bummer Movie Night,"Oil never got hot enough for the popcorn to pop. We live in Colorado, so maybe this is an altitude thing, but Cuisinart did not say that was the issue. My husband and I worked with this machine for over an hour trying to pop two different kinds of popcorn, with two different kinds of oil. A few kernels would pop, but the rest would just go round and round until they turned dark brown. We ended up popping our popcorn in a large stock pot and had much more success! Cuisinart did offer to replace this unit for us, but that would require us to ship it back to them....Amazon allowed us to easily ship it back for free. Thank you Amazon!"
1,Bought this at Sam's Club,"We, as similar to others, were focused on the Cuisinart brand. Went through 4 of these within a 1 month period all had similar defects. When attatching the base to the popping container the locking tabs break. The tabs are very poorly constructed and it is not capable of frequent usage. Do not buy this product.Buyer beware."
1,Not what I expected from Quisenart,What a pc of junk. We are now on our 3rd one of these. The latches that hold the heating element to the base have broken on the first two after only a few uses. Now the one we have is broken were the probes go thru to the cord. The ribbed design is difficult to clean but it is nice to clean the heating unit. We expected far more from this fine company. Only thing keeping us going is the liberal return policy. Make sure you keep your box to send it back. I think between the three we've poped 10 batches at the most.
1,Another fine POS from Cuisinart-the CPM-900BK,"Purchased this and on the 3rd usage the handles that secure the heating plate to the base broke off. Spending $60 for a popcorn popper, spending money on the Cuisinart name...you'd expect more than three uses. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Great Popcorn popper,"This machine produces great popcorn, I haven't run into any issues with soggy popcorn or chewiness. Something to watch though, all kernels aren't created equal, test out different brands to see what works best with the oil you use and this popper, just because the labels says ""gourmet"" doesn't mean the popcorn will work great.The machine is easy to care for and clean. After making a couple batches consecutively the machine will need to cool down before it will function again, this is an annoying safety feature... but I understand the need for it. Just something to think about if you are using this for a party."
1,turkey,"This machine makes fabulous popcorn with only 1 tsp of evoo and the full included measure cup of corn. It is light and crispy. Cleans up in the dishwasher great. THAT SAID:I bought it 9 December 2008. I have used it four times, and its broken for the fifth. Something broke off inside the base unit. I never dropped it, or abused it, or put the heater element on wrong. It just stopped working. I bought it because it was a cuisinart and now I am thoroughly disappointed.We'll see what customer service does. I am calling them tomorrow.UPDATE: They sent me a brand new one, free of charge, and three years later, still works great."
4,My Most Frequently Used Small Kitchen Appliance,"Due to the number of reviewers complaining of defective products I waited almost 6 months to review Cuisinart CPM-900BK EasyPop Popcorn Maker, Black to make sure it would stand up to frequent use. So far, so good. I have used the popper frequently over 6 months. Nothing has broken even when my dog has knocked the clear plastic bowl off of the counter on more than one occasion. My tile floor is not forgiving. Any glass item would have broken. No parts of the base have cracked or broken either.I have noticed very few hulls when popping popcorn with this popper. The kernels may not be quite as fluffy but I don't know if it is the popper or the kernels because I have used only organic kernels that I did not use prior to using this popper.Four stars because I think the base gets too hot and could be a burn hazard to a child if they were to touch the heating element when it is not attached to the base.Cuisinart CPM-900BK EasyPop Popcorn Maker, Black"
1,poor quality ? d/t made in China,"I've had this unit less than a year, first the clips on the base cracked within a few wks, then a piece of the heating unit cracked & broke off, finally the whole frame on heating unit fell off. All this after careful use of the unit. I just received a replacement ( had to pay shipping cost), I don't expect any better results as it is the same product. Shame on Cuisinart, I trusted your brand name. Never again."
5,Healthier alternative to microwave popcorn,"This popcorn maker is a great alternative to those unhealthily microwavable brands. You make the popcorn to your liking, with very little oil. For me I use a whole mess of salt and real melted butter...we are talking about snack food after all. The best results, though, do come from using less oil. The unit is quick and easy: oil, kernels, and switch it on, that's it. It even pops right into the serving bowl. The vents at the top help the hot air move through the popping chamber making the popcorn light fluffy. But this is no air popper; you know this is the real deal when you taste it. Another thing I found useful was the bottom lid on the severing bowl. It prevents a mess by catching the salt and crumbs that can slip through the vents. Getting the bottom plate attached is a pain but it's a one time operation. Overall, this is a great value and I am quite satisfied with its performance."
1,Three strikes for poor design,"We have had three of these machines, with great hopes for each. The first was the older model with no vent holes. The motor on that one died in short order. The second and third units were the newer models with the improved bowl - a good example of listening to the customer. Unfortunately the electric connection from the heating element to the base is very poorly designed and of inadequate quality. On both the second and third units the plastic terminal covers broke, rendering the heating element useless. Considering that this is Cuisinart, that we bought them all through Williams-Sonoma, and the amount of negative feedback I am (now) seeing, it seems that Cuisinart really needs to go back to the drawing board."
2,CHEAP!!!,"I bought one of these for my son and one for myself. It worked for about 5 months and like most of the other people, the clip that seats the heating element BROKE!!! Mine broke day before yesterday and my son called yesterday and told me his BROKE TOO!!!! You would think when you pay $60.00 for a popcorn popper, it would last longer then 5 months. Not going to pay the expense of returning it to the manufacturer or PAY TO GET A NEW ONE, what's up with that?? So much for guarantee's!! Threw it in the trash. Don't waste you time and money on this one."
2,gross popcorn,I bought this popcorn maker for my wife for Christmas. This turned out to be a huge let down. The popcorn comes out chewy and wet. Would not recommend this to anyone. Very disappointed with Cuisinart on this one as we love our Cuisinart pans and mixer.
3,Works OK,Makes nice popcorn but the clip that holds the plate on broke off within 2 months. Also difficult to get the cover on before flipping the bowl over. Overall - Meh. Might be a better one out there.
1,Cuisinart CPM-900BK EasyPop Popcorn Maker,"I used to trust Cuisinart for decent engineering and product quality. No Longer!After the 3rd use...3 silly times....the heating base unit no longer worked....therefore, no popcorn.A waste of time and money.....buy the older cheaper plastic versions from West Bend, we have one at our cabin that is over 20 yrs old and works like a charm...at half the price.This product was a horrible investment...junk after 3 uses."
3,"Good popcorn, poor design","There are never any unpopped kernels left, but the design is faulty. The clear plastic top slips around on the base, and can fall off and break if you're not careful. That just happened to me as I was carrying it to the pantry to put it away. The replacement bowl is $22 plus $7.95 shipping! I paid $29.95 at Costco for the whole unit, so it makes more sense to buy another one. I do think it makes good popcorn, thus the three-star review."
1,Broken...AGAIN!,"I am on my third replacement popper. I've had it. Will not request a new one. I'm tired of getting the ""it must have been something YOU did"" tone from the Cuisinart folks. NO, it was NOT something I did. I have treated these poppers with kid gloves since they appear to be ever so delicate. First to break were the contacts for the heating element. Second popper's handle clips broke. And now so have the third popper's. Oh, Cuisinart WILL send you a new one. But you have to pay for shipping and handling and you have to send the old one back. Run. As fast as you can to another brand."
2,Side Locks Keep Breaking- Poor QA,I am on my forth Cuisinart popcorn popper in a month. The side locks have been broken on delivery or break within the first few times it is used. You can use it anyway and the popcorn really comes out nice but these cheap plastic tabs on the side keep breaking. Cuisinart is really letting there quality slip. I really want this popper to work because I like the look - the only other option is the stir-crazy which takes up much more counter space. Kudos to Amazon.com for being so responsive with the replacement units.LMB
1,Poor plastic body... Broke after gently using only twice,Worked great to start with!Latch broke just within 2 uses. The plastic is too fragile/brittle on the main detachable part.Called cuisinart for warranty replacement. Courteous rep but the replacement product is back-ordered. Not sure if and when they can ship the replacement part.
1,JUNK,"I like the way it works but...this is my second unit, I warrantied the first after the retaining clips failed. They have done the same on the replacement unit. I try and buy good quality items and am not adverse to the cost if the product and service reflect. Cuisinart Service is very non-service, the only response they would conjure is if the product was under warrantee. So back to Costco for return. I am re-evaluating Cuisinart as a part of our kitchen. As the product craps out I will look at anything else."
1,Very disappointing,"This is the slowest and least productive popcorn popper I've ever used. I thought the Cuisinart name would guarantee a quality product, but it is definitely garbage. I tried multiple types of popcorn from basic store brand to gourmet online providers. Never did the bowl fill and I was always left with tons of unpopped kernels."
2,don't bother,I have had 2 of these. The popcorn tastes great but both machines broke. The first one was under warranty so Cuisinart replaced it. The second one broke after the warranty was expired. It isn't made well for placing the hot plate onto the popper....that is the part that broke both times.
2,Cheaply Made,Very excited to receive product. After 6 cycles the popping plate latches broke! Made of plastic they broke prematurely! I must press down on the popper bowl now to make sure the contacts make a proper connection while unit is in use! Ouch!!! Contacted the manufacture through e-mail but they have not responded! Can not get through on the phone either! Line is always way too busy! Very disappointed with the manufacture! I thought I was buying top of the line merchandise! Be careful!
4,Great Popper,"Bought this as a gift. Previous one was dropped and broke. Excellent popper, no problems with the previous one or this one."
2,sea monkeys,"My eight year old grandson wanted to grow sea monkeys. We purchased this item and have followed the step by step instructions. It has been 2 weeks now, we are unable to locate any sea monkeys.Needless to say my grandson and I are dissappointed."
2,Appears bigger in the picture,"I was so disappointed by the actual size of the sea monkey container. A sea monkey is hard to see on it's own, but add a small container to that and it's even more frustrating. I wouldn't recommend anyone else waste their money on it. You really don't get your bang for your buck."
5,had them before same style tank and everything else.,I used to have Sea Monkey's mine lived for an incredible 7 years ( got them at the age of 10 and had them till i graduated high school then my dopey cat knocked them over) i never once had to add new eggs because the little guys were always reproducing i even had one i wore around my neck for 3 months till he died... then 4 little suckers hatched in there and i put them in the tank with the other ones. Makes great pets for an apartment or kid over the age of 10 and if properly cared for will live for many many generations ( plus if they die and the tank dries out just add purified water again and viola more sea monkeys) try putting them under a black light ( it may have been one of my mutant ones but) they emit a soft reddish glow in relation to the black light.
4,Sea Monkey One,Was a ton of fun. My son & I watched them grow up.The sad news is they did not survive for long.
4,"Items Arrived Quickly, And As Advertised!","Pros:Arrived QuicklyAs AdvertisedJust As I Remembered Them When I Was A KidCons:These Were Purchased For A Gift Basket, And Haven't Been Sent Yet"
5,Great Learning Experience For Kids,I got these little sea monkeys for my nieces. They absolutely love them and love to learn about the little brine shrimp. Its a great way to entertain children and teach them a small amount of biology on the side. I even had fun setting the stuff up for them! I only rated durability as a 4 star because you cant really let the children move it around too much. Its more of a let it sit and watch type toy. Either way they love it!
1,See Monkeys,"Th toy was a gift from a certificate to be used as an educational experience for my 6 YO son. The instructions were detailed and the list of requirements were many. So as a parent, my work was cut out for me.As the monkeys begin to hatch there is the delicate daily responsibility to aeriate the water by means of pouring the liquid back and forth between clean containers. So that step can be a little unnerving with little one.However, the kit was complete and offers plenty of other options (for a price) and a guarantee to produce sea monkeys."
5,Great for Singles,"I live alone and I can't really have a cat or a dog because they demand a lot of attention and care. To be honest I can't even take care of myself properly LOL what to say of a living creature friend. So I decided to listen to some friends and buy sea monkeys. They are fun. If you follow the instructions in a few days you have some living ones swimming in the bowl. It's a nice way to have a little life in your apartment. And trust me, they are easy to take care of. Food once, maybe twice a week. Never change the water....that's it....Easier than flowers...And you always have the feeling you have something to watch.Good for kids too, to teach them to have responsability when taking care of something. It's fun!"
2,Waste of money,"Our four year old asked for this for Christmas. She was so excited to get it, but it started leaking all over the place after the first use. It just got worse and worse until we finally pitched it. Definately not worth the money spent."
1,Worthless and Messy,"This toy leaks sand all over the place, the release button gets jammed with sand and the concept of having to take off the cap to refill from the screen is foolish. Do not waste your money"
1,These hits are a miss,"Though it doesn't say it anywhere in the product description, this collection is NOT of the original recordings. The original artists are credited but the recordings are NOT what one would expect. Even the few selections that sound as though they MIGHT be the original versions have been remixed (echo effect, for example) so that they are not the original sounds. Stay away from this CD if you expect to hear the original hits. I am very disappointed at the misleading nature of this product!"
4,Relief!,"It was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade Word and Excel, and to get Virtual PC (for Access) as well. I used them a lot on my PC a few years ago, and when I first switched to Mac, couldn't find software that did what they did. I had no trouble installing the upgrade on my iMac G5, nor did I have trouble installing Virtual PC. The only thing that WAS disappointing was that I couldn't find out whether accessing the Internet from Virtual PC would open me up to PC-type viruses, or if Mac's Unix system would protect me there, too. I continue to be disappointed that the Mac version of this software is not as rich as the PC version. But the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do."
2,Mocrosoft on a Mac,I was able to install most of MS office but am having printer conpatability problems. I wasn't able to install Vitural Pc properly and get error messages when i boot up. I'm going to have to the Mac store genius bar to get the problems straightened out. All in all I think that every thing will work OK but I'm going to have yto travel over 50 miles to get it fixed. Maybe it's best to stick with Mac software for Macs. I've NEVER has a problem installing them.
2,"Nice suite, but Virtual PC 7 disappoints on my G5","I purchased the upgrade since I'd already bought both Office v.X and Virtual PC 6.1 last year.The biggest letdown is that Microsoft's promised support for the G5 is nearly non-existent. I have a dual processor G5 with an ATI Radeon 9800 card (Apple), and after trying to install Virtual PC 7 three times, I cannot get a VM to work. It did install (and work) flawlessly on my G4 Powerbook. Googling for reviews finds it's very hit or miss, but if (when) it misses, you'll regret investing the extra $$$ in an immature product."
3,War duty on the USS Steele,"Unlike the above negative review, I have have some good words about PACIFIC ODYSSEY. The book vividly describes the many tasks placed upon USS Steele in the Pacific[ convoy duty, recon missions, anti-submarine patrols, bombardment,etc.].The reader follows the DE on it's constant missions with little R&R; for the crew.The book is complemented with many excellent maps. As a bonus, the reader is also given a good description of the island hopping campaign.The book could have benefited from a few photos of the USS Steele."
2,"Neat concept, gets boring quick","The rubber-like skin is neat and gives the robotic toy a realistic look, but I question its toughness and mending a tear may prove to be quite hard. Underneath, the articulations and mechanism feel fragile, and I question if the toy would survive a drop down the stairs or off a table.Overall, while it may appear appealing in the package, I don't recommend it. It gets boring real quick, and I don't think it will take the abuse of a kid, even if recommended for age 6+More in-depth review here: [...]"
5,Buy more than one :),"This is an awesome toy!I was in the store at Christmas and saw a woman fill her cart with these.I was curious and bought the T-rex as a cute visual for under the Christmas tree.Well my son(5)tells me all the time how that was the best gift he has ever gotten.I have gone back to get another(t-rex needs to fight some thing)and have not found them.I came on this site only to find they are on sale.I would advice getting more than one because they are alot of fun and the best gifts!P.S. if you are a mom and tired of gettting hurt playing battle with your son,this is the answer.They are big but made of foam,so no scratches or bumps from fierce battles :)"
5,A Wealth of Information,"When my son began the first grade I had a strong interest in placing him in a challenging school that will increase his potential to learn. The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools helped me in the process of finding the appropriate school for my son. The book provides detailed information such as, tuition, amount of grants received by the school each year, address, telephone number, etc. I was especially thrilled by the chapters focusing on financial aid, scholarship programs and testing referrals. I reccommend this book to anyone in the preliminary process of finding a specialized school in Manhattan."
4,four and 1/2 stars.,"looking for some jazz that's busy and going places? something uptempo and fine? well, here you have it. this is an outstanding album of energetic jazz. with all the players involved here, and the pace that they go at it, it's amazing how precise everything comes out. each instrument, each note seems about as right as it should be. very very entertaining, indeed."
2,Flimsy replacement jar. Buy direct from ShopKitchenAid instead for $12.99,"Made a mistake buying from SmallAppliance.com rather than going to shopkitchenaid.com. Paid $25.99 for a flimsy, cheap replacement coffee grinder bin when I could have paid $12.99 at shopkitchenaid.NO mention in the Amazon listing that the ""KitchenAid 4176728 Ground Coffee Jar"" is not actually a KitchenAid product."
2,Thinner than the original,"The biggest complaint that I have about the Kichenaid Pro-Line coffee mill is that the ground coffee jar is too thin and fragile. I bought this as a replacement after the original broke. This jar is even thinner and lighter, coming in at 123 grams. The original weighed 143 grams. I'm disappointed by the thoughtless design. Why can't the jar be thicker and stronger? It gets two stars for fitting the mill. Other than that, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Buy one just in case,"I took others advice and purchased a spare coffee jar for my KitchenAid coffee grinder as this part is glass and you never know what may happen as you use it. I do not find it any thicker than the original part that came with the grinder, which I had hoped it would be. The glass is thin and you must be aware of that after you grind the beans. I still think it is a good idea to purchase one for a spare."
3,Vendor could use more thought in shipping,"The container is simply a glass globe which fits the Kitchenaid coffee grinder. It was a perfect fit and was original equipment as manufactured by Kitchenaid. The first one arrived in a thousand pieces (literally). The shipper had mailed it in its original light cardboard carton from Kitchenaid with a thin styrofoam cover. Not enough to survive the postal service (or any other service). They had to resend a new one, but even this time it was just placed inside another box, it survived but I was a bit surprised that it did. Great price, glad to find the item, but more thought needs to be put into shipping things."
4,Good replacement glass jar for grinder,"As others have stated, the original glass container for very thin- it was only a matter of time before it shattered everywhere.This jar is thicker than the original, in which I would assume it might be a little more resistant to shattering upon a small knock against a countertop. Obviously, the only drawback is the simple fact that the replacement glass is an astonishing $17...pretty hefty price tag for a tiny glass jar.Amazon delivered it quickly, more importantly, in one piece.Happy grinding-"
5,Replacement Carafe,"I ordered this replacement after reading several reviews and it works exactly like the original!I actually wouldn't mind it if it were a little heavier but that being said, I highly recommend this product!"
2,Price is ridiculous - buy it at shopkitchenaid.com,"I saw in another review that someone regretted not purchasing it at the KitchenAid site. I just went to the KA site, didn't see the jar and chatted with their online help - they did confirm to me that the ""KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Mill Replacement Bin"" SKU:KPCGBIN was indeed the correct part. Oddly enough, there is no picture of the ""bin"" but that's why KA has an online help system I suppose. Anyway, I ordered two (one for backup just in case - mama isn't kind without her coffee). Total cost for two, shipped, plus tax was under $30.I'm all about making a profit but when you can get it for less than half price by going direct to the KA site, one would be foolish not to.Happy shopping!"
3,coffee jar,We needed to replace the original coffee jar provided by the manufacturer. The replacement glass piece is not as heavy as the original.
5,Replacement coffee grinder jar,"Just as good as the original grinder jar, I believe that this is all I need to say about this item. Thank you"
1,Total rip-off,Book is little more than a collection of not very detailed information in very large part already available on the web. Largely an ad for purchases from Pelican Parts auto parts website where much of the information is already available.
3,Not a great selection,"This book had some useful tips on projects but the projects chosen were not the most interesting and, in my opinion, not that well explained. The manual is not very well edited. The author also acts like the E30 and the E36 are basically the same which they are not. This is a lazy excuse to simplify procedures and appeal to a wider range of BMW drivers."
4,"Lots of projects, ok book","I like the in depth look at various projects. The descriptions and pictures are well thought out and descriptive. Unfortunately I was expecting more from the cosmetic side of things than the mechanical, but overall this is a great book."
4,Good but not for E46,"I have an E46 not realizing that this book covers the other model. There is some cross over and what is good about this book that it stirs up what repairs and modifications can be done. There are photos and list of tools needed.The only thing that would make this complete is more photos, diagrams and step by step instructions. For the newbie this is a good book for all around information.Please make one for the E46..... Maybe I will do one but I am not adventurous to overhaul my engine."
4,Great companion book to Bentley Manual.,"It's always helpful to get a 2nd opinion. Which is why having this book is so helpful. So the Bentley manual is THE BIBLE for E30 BMWs, but 101 Projects is good in its own right and also worth having to cross-reference against. Probably a bit more useful to the E36 owner than E30. I recommend if you want to start fiddling with your BMW E30/E36- get both."
2,Title is misleading,"The title indicates this book covers E30/E36 3 series cars from 1982-2000 but, going through the projects, they are mostly based around twin cam 6 cylinder engines and modern cars. There is one chapter(project) on replacing a timing belt on an E30 engine and one on adjust the valves on the same but if you have a car from the 1980's, I wouldn't recommend this book at all."
5,Solid Cannonball,"Just a tad below his very finest work on record, but still a very impressive achievement. ""Serves Me Right"" disappoints somewhat, but ""Just One of Those Things"" cooks from the get-go. The other tunes are all very solid. Top-drawer Adderley."
3,"Great coverage of topics, major editing flaws","I bought this book to review for Oregon's teacher licensing test. It covers the topics and most of the time it is easy to understand. If you have never done trig, I don't know if you would understand it. The problem is with the accuracy in the math questions. The book is full of questions to help you, gradually they become more complex. However, I find myself correcting the book as I go. I would say about 10%-15% of the answers are wrong. Sometimes they get the answer correct in the explanation, but where they state the answer it is wrong. This is an editing mistake that would have been easily fixed by a few TAs. They could have edited the book in a few hours and made it a lot easier for those of us trying to relearn the subject. Nothing like knowing you did it right, but the book has a completely different answer. Overall, this book is not one I would recommend unless you just want a quick review and are confident in your own mathematic skills."
4,NO FROTH BUT WILL SAVE $$$,"I bought this for my Senseo and I was disappointed to find that the coffee did not have the froth that comes out when you use the pods. It's also more difficult to figure out the right amount of coffee to use to get it right. But if you have a frother, like your coffee stronger (this gives you the option of using the 2-cup measure for 1 cup of water-making a much stronger cup of coffee) like using your own coffee and save money, then this is a good investment. I'm not sorry I bought it."
3,A Disappointing Effort By A Great Band...,"First of all, I have to say that I am a huge fan of this band, and hold them to a very high standard. This record makes me think that Robert Schneider is running out of ideas. At times, the lyrics are thin, and the melodies seem uninspired. There are a few gems, but you would be better off buying Fun Trick Noisemaker, Science Faire, Tone Soul Evolution, or anything by Neutral Milk Hotel or Beulah. Let's hope that the next Apples record lives up to their brilliant past."
3,Good - But There's a Problem,"This, like most all of The Apples in Stereo's works, is obviously meticulously crafted. Robert Schneider and crew worked hard to capture a certain `60s sound, and they did an excellent job. Each song is a singular almost perfect experience. That's all be said before. However, in this lies the problem. In the end, this album leaves the listener with, if anything, a sigular question: What do The Apples REALLY sound like? There's nothing wrong with being progressive, and choosing a different sound every time around, but this refusal to not only to commit, but then also to innovate, becomes frustrating. After a period, this album is set aside to gather dust, leaving the listener with something most akin to good memories (or even`60s specifically): enjoyable nostalgia, but impossible to return to."
4,this is the best apples,"so far, at least; and every release by 'em is worth having. they are certainly in a neck-and-neck with Olivia Tremor Control for the best of the E6 conglomerate (tho that's not saying all that much when you think of how incompetent and superfluous Elf Power, the Minders and Beulah are). still: it's kinda uncanny how the Aps parley an obvious love of beatles/beach boys into something fresh (but don't bother seeing them live--they cannot play their instruments, and cannot play them in tune AT ALL). the following bands put out better, similar happy pop records this year, however: PAPAS FRITAS, THE BLACK WATCH, ROBYN HITCHCOCK, SUGARPLASTIC."
4,Good Album,"I finally bought this album recently because I waited too long to find it used, and I regret doing so. This is a finely-crafted album with very memorable moments, heard especially in the first two songs (two of the best I've heard the last couple of years). I had the ""Look Away"" EP, but that lacks the coherence of the full album. I can understand why people may be a little hostile towards this band, but forget about their influences. I hate the Beach Boys as well as some Beatles stuff (I love the rest). I think their work sounds fresh (why would I listen to them if I hated most of the music from that period?). They can borrow from the middle sixties but not plagarize because their work sounds just as much like the Beach Boys as it does any experimental band of the last three decades."
4,My first taste of Apples is a good one,"It's nowhere as spaced-out as ""Black Foliage"" from the Olivia Tremor Control, but the Apples' new effort definitely brings the E6 influence in full force. The 60's psychedelia/Beatles influence is obvious (consult ""Submarine Dream"" in both title and sonics), but not overwhelming in the sense that this record sounds like a nouveau-hippie rehash: ""Go"" leads the record off with an absolutely smile-inducing horn section hook, while ""20 Cases Suggestive Of..."" gets a nod for sounding so much like that Madonna song from the 'Austin Powers' sequel (I mean that in a good way). There isn't a whole lot of variation in the songs - most are either 'rock' songs or slower ballad-esque pieces - but it doesn't necessarily hinder the record to my ears (more diehard Apples fans may disagree). ""The Discovery..."" is a good pop record and a great place to start your journey into the Elephant 6 Collective."
3,Dash Pocket,"Meh... It's okay. Looks kinda cheap if you ask me. After reading one review here I thought this would be a fun project. It wasn't really much fun. Seems like everything I do on this truck is a pain but usually when I'm finished and admiring my new stuff it seems worth the trouble. When I got done with this I was kinda like, 'it doesn't look all that nice'."
2,It Fits OK But...,The fit is fine however this is quite shallow. The depth is very limiting and makes this of little use to me. I found one that is at least an inch deeper and is more practical.Shop around.
1,Oh well,The piece in the picture is not the piece I received. It fits but does not have the slots to place CDs in. Just a big empty space to cover up the wiring. Not a huge issue but I'd like to get what I ordered and paid for.
4,Wiper Arm,"Looks like the original wiper arm. Looks good and work great!! Price was alot cheaper than the factory one, ford wanted twice as much as I paid for it."
3,Great footage............but brutal sound,"Finally Bon Scott fantastick.......but in mono?The video footage is awesome, but the sound is brutal. It's not in digital!! But Why?I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 5 STARS IF NOT FOR THE SOUND."
2,Disappointed,"I have been listening to AC/DC since 1976 and really love thier work, even the work of Brian Johnson up till about 1990. I had not seen much material with Bon Scott as far as live concerts and was hoping this set would contain some actual live footage with live audio. I did enjoy the video but it is obvious that the audio is dubbed on top of the video from studio tracks. This was very lame to say the least. I could have just played my CD collection while watching this and had same result. What a jip. I would have rather listened to the bad audio than the over-dubbs. I would recommened this only to people who have never seen Bon perform. Don't expect any live material as this is as stale and commercialized as it gets. Sorry guys but there are no jewels here, just paste passed off as jewels."
3,"Good, But Not Great","Let me start by saying, if you are an ac/dc fan, buy this if ur not, then dont, WHY DO THEY CUT OFF THE INTRO 2 SONGS LIKE DOG EAT DOG AND AND THE END OF RNR DAMNATION??? why is the baby please dont go clip better quality than the highway to hell and back in black clips?? and why not release anything after '91? the hail caesar vid is hell funny."
5,history of ac/dc via video!,"I got this dvd and have watched it hundreds of times the video's with Bon Scott are priceless and are a most for any ac/dc fan! I can't belive there are some used, you'll never see mine for sale!"
3,Expecting more?,"The package arrived as listed but I was expecting more from the actual DVD. I was hoping to see more concert footage but all it was, the video library of AC/DC. The video's are great but I was expecting more."
5,This is the greatest rock compilation ever!,"Two DVD's and incredible package for the fan! 2 1/2 hours of classic and rare videos, TV appearances and live clips, including a 24 page booklet. A must for fans? That's a no-brainer! Seeing AC/DC on television has always been a rare occurance.; after all, this was the band that tried to ""blow up your video"" during the height of MTV`s late-`80`s boom. Television appearances and promotional music videos have always been a necessary evil to this band of no-nonsense rockers. But when they did grace the airwaves it was like a bolt of lightning - their energy and spirit transforming a typically staged video into something magical and larger-than-life."
4,"Thorough and Complete, yet lacking.","You will not find a more thorough documentation of ac/dc's TV appearances then on this set. Around forty songs altogether, which makes it a must for any ac/dc fan-- whether you're a diedhard or casual fan. It's great to see Bon's performances in the early days, but there are no TV interviews with Bon Scott or the rest the ac/dc gang on the DVD. It's strictly perfomance clips. Sure, it's the performances that are important, but alternative footage of the band would've rounded the DVD out nicely. Also the DVD is a bit pricey (It costs $40.00 Canadian!). Excellent (especially the ""Long Way to the Top' video). Highly recommended, but you must see AC/DC live in concert. One of the best live shows I've ever seen!"
4,AC/DC ROCKS,If you are a AC/DC fan then buy this dvd. It shows video clipsfrom the Bon and Brian eras. My personal favorites are theflick of the switch and fly on the wall videos. The clips look great and as usual the music ROCKS!.
5,AC/DC in there prime...................,"I love this DVD, the Bon Scott material is the best I have ever seen. Brian Johnson is a great singer but he cant hold a candle to Bon Scott. I wasnt a fan of these guys till I heard ""Highway To Hell"" LP, I was hooked after that....too bad I never got to see Bon is his heyday. I love the song ""Rock and Roll Damnation"", a real powerhouse rocker, real head banging stuff. Im not going to go through every song on this DVD becuase that would take forever, but in my opinion the Bon Scott material blows the Brian Johson stuff away. Disc 2 is ok but I got bored watching it, There older stuff was way better than the 80s and 90s...... buy this DVD if its just for the 1st disc, you`ll see just how good these guys were. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Yep, that is what I was looking for",This is a must have item for the one who wants to rock. The first DVD is so great that I keep replaying it for the last few months and I have not seen the second one too.
5,awsome,"If you are a AC/DC fan this is a must have. It has the best from the Bon Scott day,s and the Brian Johnson day,s. there are video,s that i did not know were ever made. This is a great buy."
4,Bonafide,"I have been an AC/DC fan for many years. I bought this DVD, because I did not live in the Bon Scott era, and I wanted to see live performances with Bon Scott. I was pretty happy with both DVDs. I think they could have remastered the audio and video from the original master films so it would look better, but thats not a really bad thing. Overall, if you like AC/DC, you may like this DVD. Some of the videos can be seen online when you use the ConnecteD CD key on the reissued CDs. I will rate this 4 stars. This is a must-have for big AC/DC fans!"
5,An Incredible Collection!!!,"As I popped in disc one of this collection, my main concern was for how hollow the early songs might sound due to the age of the clips. How wrong I was! The sound quality on all of the songs/videos is absolutely amazing. I was blown away by Riff Raff especially, because it is from the If You Want Blood... album that had no bass or depth on cd. That is definitely not the case with the video. The other nice thing about this collection is that there are no annoying interviews or documentaries. Just pure, unadulterated power! If you're contemplating getting this collection, don't think on it too long. Just go get it.....NOW!"
4,"Great, but","Has anyone figured a way to convert the DVD tracks to audio tracks in the MP3 format? I want an MP3 version of each song on the DVD without having to buy the CDs. I've tried to rip and convert, but no luck yet."
2,All of the hype amounts to nothing in the end...,"I am surprised at all of the positive reviews on this item. When I bought this disc I was excited to put it in and see all of the great ""live"" and ""never before seen"" footage that was SUPPOSED to be there. I expected something along the lines of the Pink Floyd ""Making of DSOTM"" disc or the Led Zeppelin 4 Disc set. Unfortunaltely, after taking about 5 minutes to FF through the disc, I realized I'd been taken. The so-called ""live"" performances are old clips that I'd seen before with the actual studio recordings dubbed over it, when I hear ""live"" I don't expect to hear the track that I could just listen to by putting in the CD. Secondly, there weren't any interviews, commentary, or behind the scenes footage. Nothing on this disc is new (as in never seen before). In the end, it's just music videos and some Bon Scott videos that everyone has already seen. I was disappointed and you may be too."
1,sad mistake,"I had high hopes on this one, especially for some early Bon Scot performances. Very disappointed in this feeble Australian version of Amercan Bandstand. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,Good considering AC/DC DVD selection out there,"Great sound quality and performances, but I personally find it annoying when producers of these DVDs introduce each song instead of just putting the whole concert performance on the DVD. There really isn't that many performances on this double dvd. I was expecting more out of it, but I would still buy it again, considering there isn't too many other of their performances out there."
3,Beware.,"Pretty good, but none of it is real. If you're not a musician then you might not even notice, but if you are you will be sorely disapointed. Why wouldln't they use the live source audio, i mean ACDC's an amazing live band with tight sound and a solid beat. Still it's a good DVD, especially if you're a fan like me, just a slight disapointment. Owell"
2,I dont'care....,"Unless they release thre master video LET THERE BE ROCK, I think all of these late realeases are just money collection."
3,It's OK,"It was ok, I mean it's a great video but I dont like the music videos alot.They're pretty good but I wish everything was live but its cool.Overall it's worth getting!"
4,"2nd album, good but not as great as the first.","The Rainmakers follow up to their debut in '86, ""Tornado""#116, wasn't as good, but it had some great tracks nothingless. Led by ""Tornado Of Love"", ""One More Summer"", the track that I think is their best on this album ""I Talk With My Hands"" and the beautiful ballad ""No Romance"". They also had their only hit on this album, with the carbon copy of ""Let My People Go Go"", with ""Snakedance"" #31 modern rock. ""Tornado"" is good but it doesn't hold up like their amazing 1st album."
5,Blown Away,"Bob Walkenhorst and Co. are in fine stride on ""Tornado"". It has both the trademark reflective honesty and the biting wit and sarcasm that we've grown to know and love by The Rainmakers. Walkenhorst is one of the most brilliant lyricists anytime anyplace anywhere. Give one listen to ""Tornado"" and you'll see what I mean. If you've never heard the Makers, Bob's strong midwestern accent may take you aback at first, but after the 1st few tunes, you couldn't hear these tunes any other way and it becomes a beloved character of the band. The expirementation of the band is also to be commended."
4,I must pass the SAT examination,"I want to buy this book that I can pass the exam, I think that book is very helpful..."
3,"Great Music, But A Worthless CD","The music on Sonny Rollins' ""Sonny Boy"" is awesome, but the folks at OJC should never have released this CD. The reason is three of the five tracks, ""Ee-ah,"" ""B. Swift,"" and ""B. Quick"" were originally issued on ""Tour De Force."" A fourth tune, ""Sonny Boy,"" was added to ""Tour De Force"" as a bonus track to complete the original recording session of 12/7/56. So that leaves you with ""The House I Live In,"" and if you're willing to pay $ for one song then I've got this bridge.... What OJC should have done is nixed the reissue of ""Sonny Boy"" on CD altogether, and added the ""The House I Live In"" to the ""Rollins Plays for Bird"" CD to reunite it with that 10/5/56 session."
3,"Great music, but available on other CD's","Just an added note to the other posted review: ""The House I Live In"" has been added as a bonus track to the RVG edition of ""Rollins Plays for Bird."" So now there's really no reason at all to get this CD, unless you happen to prefer this particular set of tunes together on one disc."
5,Stanley #4 Woodworking Plane,I have been collecting Stanley woodworking planes for many years and I was intersted in this unit as it is fully adjustable and very easy to use. The cost is reasonable and the quality of the #4 plane is excellent. While it is not of the quality of the very old Stanley wood planes it does an excellent job for the money. I would recommend this unit to anyone needing a woodworking plane to be used for reasonable working jobs or as a basic starter plane.
1,Not a good plane,"I just bought this plane thinking it would be decent because of the low price. But, you can do much better if you just look around. For this plane, the blade needs to be sharpened once you get it or you are going to be doing a lot more work and wasting a lot of time. I would suggest going your local tool shop and getting a plane. I just went to harbor freight tool and got a 9"" and 3"" plane which was much better than this one - it was heavier, the blade was sharper and the bottom was much smoother - all for $ 15. So, just look locally and use this as a last resort."
1,I hate it,I bought this so I could plane a few sticking doors. The blade is full of nicks and is not even sharp. The thing just jumps up and down and will not shave the wood. I have used cheaper planes that worked. This one will not. Stanley did not respond to an email I sent to Customer Service for assistance. Don't waste your money with this.
2,Ya get what you pay for!,I didn't wand to pay a lot for a plane so I thought I'd take a chance on this one. The sole is very rough and needs a lot of work. Hard to adjust the blade. I don't do a lot of work with hand tools so I thought I could get by with this one. Handle and knob are cheap plastic
4,Novedoso software,"Es una forma entretenida de poner nuestro sello personal a las manualidades. Para ser original con las tareas de nuestros hijos, también es un gran ayudante"
2,Could be better,"This software is only so-so. I really feel you could create a better design using graph paper and colored pencils.The good points:It has the most commonly used stitchesYou can create new stitch patternsColor palette offers a broad range of colorsYou can upload an existing imageThe bad points:Pre-cut shapes like the star, circle, and heart are not available and can't be createdSoftware creates white stitches on the background of uploaded imageSoftware has a hard time creating cut lines on an uploaded image"
2,Saw this at a Ruby Tuesday restaurant,"It is evident that the author put a lot of hard work and energy into creating this book; however, the story is rather bland and the illustrations are of amateur quality. If you want to support a ""starving artist,"" go ahead and buy the book. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to order it."
5,This is the only Air Supply collection worth having ...,"... precisely because it omits ""Two Less Lonely People"".Until they change it to ""Two Fewer Lonely People"", I don't want it in my collection. :)"
4,Fabulous!,"A nice compilation of some of their early, more popular songs. I'm a bigger fan of their later material, but everyone has their opinion. This is, admittedly, very sappy. But hey, if you're a fan of AS's 80's stuff, I'd reccommend ""The Definitive Collection."" (You get more songs.) Russell Hitchcock has that special clarity in his voice, you can understand every single word he sings. This, coupled with Graham Russell's voice (also very nice) and songwriting skills, makes for a great band. Worth a listen!"
3,"What's Here Is Great, What's Not Isn't!","For the longest time, this was the only greatest hit album you could have of Air Supply. What's here is great, but obviously they had more hits than that. Because there are more recent ""greatest hit"" albums with more songs, you don't need this. It's really embarassing that there are ONLY nine songs which make this collection skimpy. Get ""Ultimate..."" or ""Now and Forever..."" instead. However, if you are just a casual fan, then this may be all you need."
5,Classic love songs that are timeless,All their biggest hits of the 80's on one album--you can't go wrong. Russell Hitchcock and his nearly 4 octave range voice are showcased beautifully on these songs. His ability to hold a note for the record books is evident in All Out of Love whose last note is the longest held note by a singer in music history. Then there are the great harmonies along with Graham Russell. They've continued to give us so much good music in the years since but it's always nice to go back and hear where it all began for them in the USA. These songs are HUGE hits and every one is a classic.
3,Bought it for one song,"I bought this CD for one song, ""All Out of Love."" When it first came out (early 1980s?) I was into heavy metal, but somehow this mellow song touched a chord with me. I was in the British Virgin Islands in April with my kids and the bar at our place played this song, which I hadn't heard in many years. I stopped swimming in the pool and told my kids (9 and 11)to listen. I remembered that at the end of the song the singer had set some kind of record for holding a note. Anyway, I had to buy the CD when I got home. This is nothing profound; it just shows how a song from one's younger days can still bring back memories."
2,These Guys' Music Doesn't Age Very Well But...,"I've never really been a great fan of the band but I have to say that I did like ""Every Woman in the World"" and ""All Out of Love"" when I first heard them and for these reasons and possibly because the 9 tracks probably represent the best they have ever done this is a good compilation for the casual listener or those who are curious and looking for a sampler of the band.The sound in this cd isn't that great given the many other remastered versions out there and so I'd recommend you get those instead if you have more than just a passing curiosity of the band. To put it another way, if I could do it over, I'd not get this cd but some other more recently remastered release.Overall, as examples of great musicianship and/or songwriting, I suppose Air Supply never were but as syrupy love-song crooners, few could outdo them during that very brief period in the early 80s."
5,This is the collection to get,Go to no other. This is the essential collection. All the songs you know and hate to admit you love are on this CD. Why buy a CD with extra songs that you don't want?Their vocal abilities far surpass any ballad crooner today. Truly smooth vocals pierce at the heart with its strong lyrics and melodic arrangements. No need for vocal acrobatics or strained caterwauling.This is the most worthy of the collection.
5,Todo lo que quiera saber sobre el calendario Maya,"Este libro es uno de los mas reconocidos aportes al estudio del Calendario Maya que se han escrito. En un lenguaje claro nos lleva a explorar todos los tecnicismos, esoterismos y complicaciones del Calendario Maya, o deberia decir de los calendarios mayas? Si, el libro profundiza no solo en el calendario soalr, sino en el calendario lunar, lo sagrado de ambos y como su combinacion establece el significado de cada dia.Un analisis del significado de ciertos numeros y dias, basado en lecturas del Popol Vuh y otros libros sagrados mayas, le dan realce al estudio, ya que explora el calendario desde una optica mayanista.El autor, Economista graduado en Alemania y sacerdote Maya, logra el apoyo de la Liga Maya Internacional radicada en Centroamerica para la publicacion de este libro. Creo que no es necesario ningun otro aval para explciar el valor de este libro."
3,Not Mac Compatible!,"This thing might work great. I'll never know, because it is not, as the listing explicitly states, Mac compatible. The nice people at Trendnet tell me that the following models are:TEW-648UBTEW-649UBI'll try one of those instead!"
1,Very poor..,"This adapter constantly stopped working, cut in and out. stopped altogether over and over again. Piece of junk. I do not recomend it."
4,Pretty good adapter,"I use a Trendnet Range extender, and I am getting pretty consistent 270MB/s out of the rated 300MB/s. The extender is on the same floor, so I guess I was expecting perfection. This is being used to stream video (Neflix, etc.) to my bedroom PC, so I can't really deal with a flaky connection. This is good 90% of the time, and I don't think I'd get much better until the next rev of 802.11x"
2,sound quality disappointing,"I was disappointed with the quality of ""The Very Best of the Spinners"" CD by Rebound Records. Not a full sound at all. Very thin and shallow. I can't even tell for sure that it's really the Spinners. Maybe it's a recording of a recording and some of the richness was lost in the process."
5,AUDIBLY SPECTACULAR !,"TRUE SOUL MUSIC WITH A POP FEEL APPEAL TO IT! THESE SONGS WILL STAND THE TEST OF TIME! THEY HAVE A LIFE FORCE IN THEM- THE SENSATIONALLY SOULFUL ""IT'S A SHAME"", ""I'LL BE AROUND"" ""COULD IT BE I'M FALLING IN LOVE"", ""ONE OF A KIND"" I COULD GO ON AND ON- BUT NO NEED ......ORDER THIS CD TODAY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF!"
4,If you love the Spinners this is the CD for you.,Great album. Has all the songs I love. Not a bad song on the album.
3,All the essentials? Please!,"Where's Mighty Love, Love Don't Love Nobody, Then Came You, to name just three essentials missing? For the reviewer to say all the ""essential"" great Spinners tunes are here undermines his own credibility. The later Atlantic anthology, ""One of A Kind"" collection is far more complete. Pass on this one"
3,"Good, but could be better.","If you like the versions you hear on the radio, this is not the one you want. Also, if you like ""live"" versions, this is not the one. This CD has the cleaner, softer, low key cuts. That being said, it's still great music and such a great group."
4,Good Songs,All the good old favorites. It's nice to blast while you're driving home ... especially when you can repeat tracks.
5,Spinners...,It was received in very good condition and plays well. I thoroughly enjoy it. The liner notes were an interesting plus.
5,Another great Debbie and Glenn romantic comedy,"This movie is good entertainment from two great actors of their time,they were soo good together, it deserves to be on DVD like their other romantic comedy Gazebo, which I beleive is soon to be relesed on DVD."
5,Car Movies,"Husband purchased this for the cool car, but the story was awesome as well! We loved it! and you would too!"
4,Joe Kenyon - Hymne,This is great music from Joe Kenyon. I tried to purchase this album as downloadable MP3's but it's not available. I think this music should be offered as downloadable MP3's.
5,Life Lessons with Max Lucado: Book Of Psalms,"I am a Sunday School teacher for young adults at a Cumberland Presbyterian Church. I have read Max Lucado's books for over 20 years and used his Life Lesson series to teach my class. This is probably the fourth or fifth of them that I have used and it is just as good as all the others. Very good analysis of the scripture, but in layman's terms. Then good probing discussion questions and a challenge for the week. I would recommend it for personal or group study for all adult ages."
2,least helpful Lucado I've read,"I was very disappointed: the lack of depth of this study, the minimal outlines,and reliance on the readers' journaling rather than any reflection by the author.This is not what I hoped to use with an adult class at church."
5,a brilliant dragon!!!,"This is a brilliant dragon,by far my favourite slightly bendy around the waist, so that means if you spin him round too quickly he will twist round and start flying upside-down!!! Apart from that he is the perfect dragon."
3,Above average,"Not a bad CD. He's a good player and its sort of a cross between Pat Metheny and Al Dimeola. Its easy to see why this didn't catch on; he doesn't play the junk ""soft & warm"" jazz listeners require and fusion seems to be nearly dead.I expect to see Fareed Haque on an album with someone well known and then he should become more popular."
5,Classic Tom T. Hall,"Once upon a time, Country Music actually had songwriters that could sing as well as they could write; and Tom T. Hall was at the top of that list. This offering by ""20th Century Masters"" is superb and one of the most complete collections I've heard. From the rowdy ""I like Beer"" to the contemplative ""Watermelon Wine"" this album will bring back many memories. Of course, there are the comical (if nor hilarious) numbers: ""Ballad of Forty Dollars"" and ""A Week in a County Jail"". All in all, a very good compilation."
5,Great Music,This is a great album for Tom T. Hall fans. Has his best songs on it. I have played it over and over for the messages and the music. I highly recommend it.
3,Very informative,"I too think this book is a very good resource.The beginner will need a lunar atlas in addition to this book. A person could get this book and the terrific Virtual Moon Atlas software (free open source). This software is a must anyway. Or in book format I highly recommend Antonin Rukl's Atlas of the Moon.Also, I agree that The Modern Moon's tone lacks a scholarly temperance with respect to past/current lunar researchers. It is a ""personal view"" to be sure and I got a fairly constant sense of frustration from the author that sometimes detracts from the otherwise good material/theories the author values. One might find this ""candid"" writing style refreshing though. I give the book 3 stars because of this plus the indexes could be more comprehensive and perhaps combined as well since they are only a couple of pages. But maybe I am wanting a book that is just reference than reference and personal view."
4,"The Modern Moon, by Wood","Charles A. Wood has studied the moon both professionally and from personal interest for many years and writes well about it. This is a book that details and explains what we know about the moon and how it came to be what it is. Wood's style of writing is reader friendly.Regards, Red"
2,The modern Moon,"A interesting work but full of scientific errors which is suprising given that the author has a doctorate in planetary geology.I perfer ""the Moon: A Biography"" by David Whitehouse which is better in most respects. I see from the page on Whitehouse's book that Mr Wood has tried to rubbish it. Should rival authors take unwarrented and unfair pot shots at rival book. Bad form and unjustified."
4,It's ok...,"I guess I was expecting a little too much from this album because of all of the hype. It's not a *bad* album... but it's not really *great* either. I still think he has some great music writing talent, and I love listening to his voice, the harmonies, and the chords, but I feel like there was some emotion missing from the album... and not only that the album is awfully short. Maybe if I continue to play it over and over, I'll start to really like the songs, and then I can change the rating to 5 stars. :) If you are a JM fan, then you will probably like this album. However, I wouldn't base an opinion of him from this one if you've never listened to him before... that's when I'd listen to Room For Squares."
4,"a good album, give it a chance","Despite having only 10 tracks on the album, it really is filled with some good songs. Listen to it all the way through. This young man is very deep and wants to tell his story. This album has a different style than the last, ""Room for Squares"". John pulls out the electric guitar and is going for a "" New Deep"". We have high expectations for John Mayer because of his incredible talent, and his out of this world success on ""Room for Squares"". The best songs on this album are Clarity, Bigger than My Body, New Deep, and Split-Screen Sadness. The rest of the songs really shape the album out. So forget what the others say, if you like John Mayer this album will grow on you, it really is a great album."
4,This guy is amazing,"Not only can he play the guitar, but he can write some amazing lyrics. As the title indicates, these lyrics deal with heavier things. The lyrics are a lot sadder than Room For Squares, but the songs are just as good. Recommened songs from this album : Only Heart and New Deep...amazing album, the only downside is that it only has ten songs."
4,Mayer Elevates his music,As I was curious and how John would attempt to outdoany given thursday I was leary. But when I heard thesingle on the radio it was weird and that's sounds likelike John but different. It just a way of saying John hasmany levels of music talent. And his music is food for thesoul.
5,FOR ALL TYPES OF MAYER FANS,"John Mayer has a few variations of fans: the musician/acoustic type, ie-dave matthews; the stock rock fans, ie-coldplay, 3doors; the pop fans that love ""your body is a wonderland""; the blues/folksy type, ie-stevie ray is a god vaughan. This cd fulfills all the above mentioned fans. It has everything from the blues to the radio song.Mayer pleases the masses by keeping two things in every song: clever lyrics that are vulnerable, yet not too over the top; and maintaining a musicians music.The lyrics of ""heavier things"" are a little more introspective than the previous two albums, and the music sweeps from a country flavor to blues to ballade-like, and then recentering with a rhythmic rock sound. This album will be a reference for a great career that will inevitably be among Stevie Ray, Clapton, King.The cd jacket will be a pleasant surprise to all the people that will burn the disc."
4,"Different, but still the same...","After enjoying ""Room for Squares"", my girlfriend picked up ""Heavier Things"" for me. And although this album doesn't have as many shameless pop plugs, it certainly makes up for it with it's mature sound. This album is a little slower, more reflective, more bluesy, and more adult-like than his last effort. Once again, it's not ""Art house"" music like Dave Mathews, but then I never really liked his stuff anyway. This is much more digestable, and although it may be more formula and less ""creative"", it's much more enjoyable to me. My personal favorite on this album is ""Split Screen Sadness"". It has a great hook and touching lyrics..."
4,Different But Still Great,"This album is WAY different than Room for Squares. And ever since I discovered John Mayer, Room for Squares has been in my cd player. I was ecstatic when I found out that he had a new album out, and when I first took a listen to it, I was VERY disappointed. HOWEVER, the more I listened to it, and learned the lyrics and tunes, I fell in love with it. I love John's acoustic stuff, just John and his guitar, but this cd proves that he can do well with a band and an electric sound. I think that if you aren't open to something new, you won't like this cd, however it is more awesome music from my favorite singer! My biggest disappointment in this cd is that there are only 10 songs! New Deep and Bigger Than My Body are my favorites!!!"
4,Quality Recording from a Quality Artist,"John Mayer hasn't lost anything with his sophomore debut. As everyone really knows, this is his third album, but whatever...If you're looking for his typical style, this album pretty much has it everywhere you look. He hasn't lost himself down the ""pop"" road that MTV and VH1 would want him to take, and he hasn't strayed far from his obvious style evident on his past recordings. He doesn't take many risks with this album, but that is one of the things that makes it enjoyable. He digs deeper lyrically, but that is only because he is obviously a skilled lyricist. He has obviously stuck with what worked for him so well on ""Room For Squares"" and has made great music once again. I won't be one of those idiot reviewers that reviews every song - that you'll have to do for yourself. I will say this - if you are a Mayer fan who enjoys chilled out music; and enjoy CD's that are quality from beginning to end, then you won't be disappointed with Heavier Things."
2,Great Expectations,"I was blown away by ""Room For Squares""...so far, ""Heavier Things"" is not doing it for me. I intend to listen to it again & again because, hey, Mayer IS talented, but these new songs have no ""hooks"". His new lyrics go deeper for sure, but I haven't heard one song on ""Heavier Things"" that even compares to ""Neon"", or ""St. Patrick's Day"". I think John's definitely the best of the bunch when it comes to new songwriters, but I think he should've mixed up the song selection a little better on this second disc; half of what IS on it, but the other half more songs in the style of his first album.It would've shown his versatility, but satisfied those who like songs with catchy melodies. Listen to the new Steely Dan CD, ""Everything Must Go"" and you'll see just what I'm talking about. Sorry John, but as far as I'm concerned, the jury's still out, and I await what you'll do on your third album."
2,Big disappointment,"""Room for Squares"" was unique--catchy songs and great licks/lyrics. This new cd sounds like it was just thrown together to capitalize on his popularity--nothing special, hard to understand the words. I gave up after about the first six songs. TO PUT IT BLUNTLY--NOT WORTH IT!"
3,Give Him A Break. . Its tough on the road.,"Its obvious that John needs a vacation! This album was written for the most part during his never ending tour schedule. It is rushed, uninspired, one dementional, and slow. Much like ""Any Given Thursday"" This was obviousy a vehicle to line Mr. Mayers 401k. There is absolutly no ""Neon"" or ""Comfortable"" that will etch itself on the brain of any JM fan from this album. I would suggest ordering Matt Nathanson's ""Beneath These Fireworks"" due out mid October. Unlike others Matt gets better with time."
2,Major Disappointment!,"As a huge fan of JM and his previous work, I must say I am very disappointed with Heavier Things. This album is definitely not in the same league as Room For Sequares. Although the lyrics are nicely done (as always), the composition doesn't do justice. ""Something's Missing"" and ""Home Life"" are the only two decent tracks. Don't expect to find anything on the same par with ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" or ""No Such Thing"" in this album. You simply won't. Yes, as the title suggests, the sound is heavier, but unfortunately, not better."
1,Good Cure for Insomnia,"This guy still puts me to sleep. I have to turn him off when he comes on the radio while I'm driving, lest I suddenly have a Mayer-induced narcoleptic attack. Snooze city."
2,It all sounds the same,"I thought that more songs on this album would be as good as Bigger Than My Body, but I was a little dissapointed. Some of the songs are good, but overall it's a little repetitive."
2,Manufactured,"I have to agree with others who have written reviews on this album it was made with money in mind, something that will look good on trl, not from the soul, which is what i thought we could expect from John, after his first album but it turns out that we can no longer do that either~"
1,a flat attempt by a wannabe rock clown,"I thaught that John Mayers first album (Room for Squares) was a great piece of work. After he played that song into the ground, he came out with this album that quite frankly is dry, genrally flat, and a typical release for John Mayer, who has slowly become a wanna rocker. His voice doesn't change pitch or tone nearly enough and is boring. Any comparison with Dave Matthews is un-justified, because Mayer has failed demonstrate any lasting skill or extended creativity. If you want a good CD, go get a CD from an artist with talent and creativity, like Radiohead, DMB, or Counting Crows and leave this clown on the shelf."
1,Disappointment in so many words,"I have been a fan of John for about 2 years. I have turned on hundreds of people to his music, and this latest album is a sincere disappointment. There is a lack of originality and musical talent. This is not John's music, this is crap. It seems like the music company published their own material for him; this is not his work. I am so diappointed with this CD, it is not even worth you listening to. Wait for the next album or better yet pick up his first two. I could go on and on, but what's the point, this CD sucks and that is all you need to know if you are a true Mayer fan."
3,A Surprising Sophomore Release,"If you thought Room for Squares was an amazing first major label for Mayer, then give a listen to Heavier Things. Though there are decidedly less ""catchy"" tunes in Heavier Things, his voice really shows itself, as well as his soulful songwriting abilities. Standouts include ""Come Back to Bed"", ""Split-Screen Sadness"", and ""Wheel"". I admit that when I first got it, with only hearing ""Bigger than my Body"" on the radio but being a true an since Room for Squares, I was disapointed. But after a few listens, it may be even better than Room for Squares. The main thing to remember with John is to give him a chance- he'll amaze you."
5,its a different album,"while heavier things is somewhat of a disappointing follow up to RFS, it is still well worth purchasing. unlike RFS, where i loved every single song, on HT i find that 3 out of the 10 songs are weak. however, the energetic ""bigger than my body,"" and ballads like ""come back to bed,"" ""daughters,"" and ""the wheel"" make this album well worth it. in john's defense, surpassing RFS is a difficult task and i think that he did reasonably well. as the title of the album suggests, listeners should have expected slower songs which are not as energetic as those from RFS. taken in its own context, HT is soulful and filled with meaning."
2,Dave Matthews Jr Basically=Ok,talk about Patterning your Career&style off someone? when I hear John Mayer Dave Matthews is the first&Only person that really comes to mind.I like Mayer's Guitar Playing.vocally I ain't feeling Him.lyrically I can take or leave it.depends on the song.He will have a catchy song or a Song that I like here&there but overall I'll pass.He has a Pretty built in Formula&sometimes it works but more often than not it leaves me just there.I Wish a Cat like Ben Folds could get some of the Hype that John Mayer's gets.
2,Lost his appeal,Let me begin by saying that this disk is different from what I expected. I expected that lo-tech sound that John Mayer had on the Room for Squares disk. Heavier Things sounds over produced and too electronic. The singer/songwriter formally know as John Mayer has changed into something else. I really don't like the songs or the sound of this album. I expected much better from such a great artist.
5,Just lay back and enjoy the ride,"This album was on my 'MUST HAVE' list once I say John perform 'Daughters' at the Grammys last year. I was actually in the can with my wife and I was talking about the song and she didn't know what I was talking about so I drove to Borders and bought it. This entire album has that 'lay back and relax' type vibe. Songs like 'Daughters' and 'Come back to Bed' (my favorite on the album) just make we wish i were back in florida lounging by the pool. Songs like 'Clarity' the brilliant opener and 'Bigger than my Body' are sure to be in your head for weeks to come and the closer 'Wheel' is just amazing lyrically...thoughts that probe deep and make you think. This is a great vibe for an album, a great choice for final cuts that flows beautifully from open to close. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"
2,Overwrought goo,"Too bad the good melodies are covered over by over-production ""goo"" (strings, horns, etc.) The best songs on this album are simple arrangements. I liken it to a really good cake with a thick layer of icing--it doesn't need it, and when you scrape it off it tastes better."
4,Hmmm...,"This CD is ok. I'm still listening to it, but after a few listens, you get used to the songs. I have to admit that I liked ""Room For Squares"" better, and that the first time I heard this, I was a little disappointed. (It was an ""iffy"" kind of album.) But once you listen to it a lot, I'm sure you'll love it. One thing that's really disappointing is that it only has ten songs. I'd recommend borrowing it and burning it instead of buying it. It's still good, but not as good as ""Room for Squares""."
4,Heavier is always Better,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Johns new cd, but when i bought it today i listened to it 3 times in a row to get a feel for it. John has once again made an excellent album. I'm not gonna say that this is better than Room For Squares but it is a close race."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"I've been a fan of John Mayer long before he burst onto the pop radar but I must say ""Heavier Things"" lacks the certain elements that made ""Room For Squares"" and must-have CD.While ""Room For Squares"" had a least a 6 or 7 great songs, ""Heavier Things"" struggles to find 2 or 3.""Heaver Things"" features only 10 songs and feels like a rushed album made only to preserve his current success."
3,Schmaltzy Yet Appealling,"Mayer at first listen is ""Chick Music"". Listen carefully if not repeatedly and it's apparent that this is well crafted music with deep rooted lyrics. He has the ability to express relationships and life events in manner that the listener can relate to. Thumbs up for Mr. Meyer!"
1,Wanna be Rock,Basical to me John Mayer is pop and nothing else. I really find his music to be crappy. He's basically a new aged Micheal Bolten.
5,Carmen Mayer...*sigh*...i wish...,"Being the steryotypical teenager that I am, I usually listen to Hip-Hop, Rap, and R&B.; So when i first heard about John Mayer, I thought,""oh no, another gay little white boy trying to make it big, probably just a Clay Aiken clone.""I was very very VERY wrong. I practically melted on the couch when i first heard John Mayer singing on MTV. I imediatly fell in love with him. I now am an avid listener and own both of his CD's and many posters of him. His music has become a part of everyday life for me. When I am driving to school, doing homework, taking a bath, or just relaxing reading a book, I let his smooth lyrics and sexy voice wash over me.I highly recommend him to everyone!"
2,W/E,"John Mayer is completly over rated. There are so many other artist out there who diserve much more recognition than John Mayer. His cd Heavier Things is about average for him, which is very low to begin with. To make it short, you don't need to waste your time going out and getting this cd. You should pick up something new that hasn't been done before!"
5,John Mayer is amazing!!,"anyone who rated this album under 4 stars is a jackass!!!!!!!!!!There is always someone to put a good artist down, and not give him the credit he deserves!!!"
1,oh goodness,"ahem. ahem. attention please. this is NOT rock. this is norah jones gone MAN. you can not talk sexily and call it singing. just because he can play guitar does not mean he is making music. he is ripping off and mocking every soft rock artist out there and doing it in a form that makes him famous. he talks sexy so you think its singing and puts a guitar melody behind it so you think its music. hes probably solo because no band would hire him because he doesnt know the difference between music and talking. please do not get this cd and make him think his pathetic attempt at stardom is working. instead check out weezer, ozma, the vines, and early treble charger. they know what music is"
1,Again?!?!,"I should have known Mr Mayer would release a second album. When I heard the completely laughable, egotistical ""Bigger Then My Body"" (then saw the laughable 'performance"" on SNL) it made me wonder what the requirements for a record deal are anymore. I used to think it was about talent, but ya know, whatever. He reminds me of that kid in high school who started a mediocore band and had horrible vocals. Hopefully he'll realize how pathetic his ""career"" is and leave it to talented peopel like Dave MAthhew's older stuff and Eric Clapton."
1,Pure Garbage,"This album is a big F U to all the people that bought his previous CD. There are one or two songs that can be used as bait and switch material. But the of the album is basically 'ha ha sucker I got your money'. JM has a terrible voice, and that is all that is left if he doesn't play his guitar and the songs suck. I can't tell you how much I hate this album. His last album must have been a fluke.You've been warned. I give this CD one out of five stars."
5,Poetry set to Music,"Real music, different music, but good music. His words aren't the same like every other musician out there. They mean something, to him and his fans. With an ability to play the guitar that could make Jimi Hendrix beam, John Mayer will certainly be around for awhile. He is someone kids can admire, he doesn't lead a reckless life and he sings about what he cares about. Perfect for teenage kids who are searching for a niche to fit into, this CD will push them in the right direction. Nothing really cynical, sings about how his world is going which ironically seems to be just like ours... hm, go figure."
5,A great listen,"The thing I noticed about this album is how different it is than Mayer's debut ""Room for Squares"". There's not as much acoustic. This isn't a bad thing, because Mayer still does a great job. John Mayer is probably my favorite artist in this genre of music. His vocals, lyric work, music, everything is just astounding."
5,"THANK YOU , AMAZON THIS IS A KEEPER","This is my introduction to this singer, I found this cd by just searching through Amazon and I am glad I did. His sound is chatchy but with just enough originality to make him not a carbon copy of anyone else. I listened to the entire cd without wanting to skip over a song. So far my favorites are DAUGHTERS and ONLY HEART I can see myself listening to this in the car on long drives it is very easy on the ears but will not put you to sleep, only the last song I did not like as much as the rest and that says a lot. Most cd's that I own if I like four songs that is a keeper it will be replayed many times. So, all in all, I really am glad I brought this and can recommend it to others and wonderful Amazon lets you hear a few songs so check it out and see if it is for you, for me it was."
4,Superb,"The kid gets a lot of flack for being such a great songwriter. This album is not quite as catchy as his first one upon first listen, but I think it holds up better over time and is ultimately just as good or better. He's a great guitar player and he writes good songs, even if he's not as cool as the Strokes or Outkast."
4,Not so heavy,"This cd is lacking the originality and entertainment factor of ""No Room for Squares"". While it has good instrumentation and vocals, it's lacking that sing-a-long quality that his earlier songs have. I can't just put this cd in and ride the emotional rollercoaster that I have with ""Squares"". These songs have a monotony to them, but are still a great buy."
3,I hate to admit it but...,"...this is a pretty okay album. I had no intentions on listening to this album at first, but then I heard the song ""Clarity"". My first thought was that it was a Dave Matthews Band single. But then I heard John Mayer's voice and I thought that I had a jaded view of the album because of the title ""Heavier Things"" (because of the ""heavy"" music that pop atrists are releasing nowadays). I gave the album a chance and listened to it. Honestly, I really liked what I heard. I wouldn't listen to this CD on a regular basis, but it has a ""listening-to-this-album-with-your-significant-other-at-his-(or her)-apartment-on-a-rainy-evening"" type of vibe to it. My personal favorite tracks on this album are ""Clarity"", ""Something's Missing"", ""New Deep"", ""Come Back To Bed"", and ""Split Screen Sadness"". The weakest tracks are ""Bigger Than My Body"" (because of the continuous airplay) and ""Daughters"". I recommend this album to anyone and everyone. peace y'all!"
5,Amazing,"This was just an amazing following up to his first CD. The sound is a bit different from the first but just as good. I can not think of one song I do not enjoy on this CD. Among my favorites though, are Clarity, Something's Missing, and Split-screen silence. If you liked John's first CD, you definetly won't regret buying this one."
5,Mayer makes music worth listening to,"I don't know what rock I've been hiding under, but I have never heard John Mayer's music until I recently bought this cd. I don't listen to the radio...ever, but was recommended Mayer's music by two different friends, so I went ahead and bought it.Loved it instantly. The combination of acoustic rock and roll with new aged pop and a smooth sound. He has a knack for a nonchalant, cool guy delivery that's very effective. His music is so refreshing and creative, not to mention the amazingly clever linear notes in the cd insert booklet. Favorite songs include: ""Daughters,"" ""Clarity,"" ""Homelife,"" and my favorite ""Come Back To Bed.""I still have yet to hear his other cds, mainly ""Room for Squares"" but that is next on my agenda!"
5,Freakin Awesome,"This album is so damn good! After you've listened to it a couple times, your in love with it and you just want to keep listening! If you don't have it already, you seriously need to buy it!"
3,a subsequuent effort,"John Mayer's follow up to Room for Squares definitely takes on a more mature approach but loses some of its wistful sentimentality.Despite the loss of depth, Heavier Things is well put together. The sound is more polished and consistent, and Mayer's voice, while still laced with the same eagerness shown in his earlier records, adds credibility to his songs with subtle emotion and grace.Outstanding tracks - 'Bigger Than My Body', 'Come Back to Bed' and 'Only Heart'.However, 'Split Screen Sadness' is the highlight of the CD with its simplicity and melancholic beauty."
2,Baby's first solid food,"Like baby's first solid food, it's not offensive, but like the title of Track 3 says, ""Something's Missing"". It's light, clean pop that is pleasant in the dentist office, but you really wish he had just made it a little meatier. One listen and you've heard it all."
3,A bit if a disappointment,"Heavier Things is just OK ... it's not on the same level as Room For Squares. I think two things have affected this album ... 1) The record producers really polished this one up for mass pop appeal, and 2) You can tell that the songs on this album didn't have years and years of efforts behind them. The only song that seems to epitomize Mayer's style on this one is ""Daughters""."
3,An evolution in John's music,"I was very surprised by John's new album. While Room for Squares was populated with acoustic sounds and interesting stories, his newest CD is full of electric grooves that all run together and lyrics that are much more symbolic and philosophical. Instead of ""I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shakers,"" we get ""Is there a God, and what is he waiting for?""Maybe John is maturing as a person as well as an artist. The result, however, is much less interesting to listen to.Standouts on this CD are ""Bigger Than My Body,"" ""Something's Missing,"" and ""Daughters."""
1,This guy uses jimi hendrix's playing style and dave matthews singing style,"This kid is a joke. He whines like dave matthews and just imitates jimi hendrix's playing style on the guitar. And this fake won a grammy??? Typical music acclaim these days for un-original artists. Yes, he can play but he has no style of his own. Maybe in time he will become who he is, but for now he is just a clone."
2,Not very good,This CD was released to soon. It is a very poor album compared to his last one. Better luck next time John.
1,Artist of the decade...,"John Mayer is a perfect example of all that is wrong with popular music in the 21st century. His music is just completely flat, drab, dull and lifeless. Music these days has become a shadow of its former self. Back in the 80s and 90s, music was music, not a bunch of inane chatter. But today, what we once knew as music has been flattened out into a two dimensional droning sound! Artists no longer have anything interesting to say with their songs, they just ramble on about nothing. Music today is so flat and boring, it makes me wish I could go back in time circa 1991! Maybe then I'd be able to turn on a radio and hear MUSIC, as opposed to the monotonous droning of John Mayer, Maroon 5, Jason Mraz, Ryan Cabrera, etc. Where's a time machine when you need one!"
1,"Still sounds like DMB, Micheal Franks etc.",Wish he could live up to the hype. If he could then us baby boomers could relax and have a little hope for the future of rock. If this is the best the next generation of guitar playing songwriters has to offer then my grandchildren are in trouble. Mindless melancholy drivel. I don't get it. I tried. I guess I bought in to the next guitar god moniker but I'm sorry nothing special here. John lose the Strat might as well be playing nylon strings.
4,Still Good,"What else can be said about this album? It has incredibly catchy tunes and Mayer's voice is wonderful as always. Some favorites would have to be: Clarity, Wheels, Something's Missing, and Split Screen Sadness. Very enjoyable pop album that doesn't disappoint."
5,John Mayer,We saw John Mayer in concert and his live preformance was great! This record is great. Very polished quality. Musicality couldn't be better.
3,Heavier Things,"I like John Mayer a lot. But this cd is far from his hest. I have no idea how this one won a Grammy Award! Not a bad cd, but his other releases are much better."
4,Excellent album,"The title Heavier Things does reflect his new directness, lacking the lithe playfulness that resulted in a Hank Mobley joke, of all things, for an album title last time out. That extends to the rest of the album -- the humor and interesting wordplay have been toned down, leaving very little ambiguity. Mayer is now more of a record-maker than songwriter, which will undoubtedly dishearten those who liked the song-oriented Inside Wants Out, but those who just enjoyed the sound and feel of Room for Squares should feel right at home."
1,This album BLOWS!,"John Mayer is the most pretentious, average musician around. Anybody who has seen him live, or read an interview, will see he is self-absorbed and a minor talent. His has no edge, no depth and no balls ... his music will for ever remain fluff.I love TRUE signer/songwriters (Springsteen, Neil Young, Dylan and Dave Matthews who Mayer has ripped and then polished for ""pop-radio"") This album is dull and predictable...but will out sell most good music because the public can't judge talent from garbage."
3,It was okay,"This collection has a different sound than the previous albums, less acoustic flavor and more electric. Personally I like the acoustic touch that Mayer exhibited in ""Inside Wants Out"". However, this gent has a way with lyrics almost as if he was reading my mind sometimes. ""Something Missing"" is one of those cuts on this album. I played this CD 4 or 5 times before I could honestly say that I liked most of it but I'm not crazy about it."
5,John sings it from the heart.,"To see youthful talented artists like John Mayer make it and be recognized is so nice. Looking on the horizon I think the music scene is poised to see the likes of this album stay on the charts for a long time because the quality is so good. With John Mayer, Michael Buble and Norah Jones leading the way, we can expect more great things to come for a long time."
4,Heavier Things is growing on me,"Most people don't like more than one or two songs immediately after buying an album. However I bought this album yesterday and after a number of listens, I do like it very much. Smart and sensitive lyrics and creative guitar playing make for good song-writing. I especially like the song ""Home Life"" which is an accurate portrayal of what my life has been like at times. This song is up tempo and the honest lyrics are as good as No Such Thing."
2,An educated album / for worse or for better,"I've been a fan of John Mayer for some time now due to the resemblance of my other favorite acts: Oasis, Fallen From Grace, and Dave Matthews.This is an example of an album that demonstrates the talent that Mayer possesses, but does not deliver the great songwriting that Room for squares contains. Mayer seems to be testing the waters of his musical backgrounds, but I think his most successful writing is in the Folk/acoustic genre. This album seems to stray from his target audience. With that said, they definitely released the right single for the air waves.I would recommend this CD if you are into intelligent songwriting, not ""Pop-Packaged-Ready to Serve Music""."
2,Not exactly what I expected...,"I'm sure this cd has some great moments, too bad I won't find out since its collecting dust on my cd rack. Not what I exactly expected or care to hear from John Mayer. I tried my best to listen to the album fully but somehow it just didn't click. John's debut cd is definitely of better quality. Track 1, Clarity is my standout and that's pushing it. Good luck next time John."
1,Heavier things weighs heavy on my mind......,"in the fact that I paid my hard-earned cash for this highly-anticipated album. This album is deserving of no stars. John Mayer's ""Inside Wants Out,"" ""Room For Squares,"" and ""Any Given Thursday,"" albums are phenomenal. I thought he might be the second coming of Dave Matthews. On this album, his fourth effort, something is lacking in the lyrics and in the sound quality. I don't know that he sold out necessarily, he is just trying too hard. The sound quality is horrific, it is extremely tinny and lacking much bass guitar. Before you buy, borrow a friend's. For consistent artists that keep cranking out excellent music, check out David Gray or Howie Day. John Mayer has begun his trip out to pop-star wasteland and is not making it back."
2,I heard about John Mayer when he was underground...,"...back on his first album, ""Closed Doors, Open Skyways,"" and while he has definitely added a more mellow sound to his music, I can't help but think that his vocals make him sound really, ummm, gay, or at least half-gay. I wish he'd write more songs about crossing the threshold from childhood into manhood, sigh..."
3,John Mayer has gone a little Soft,"The CD isn't that bad, the good songs are probably just 1,2, and 5. Other than that its a little whiny and he's sort of singing to the girls. Maybe He realised that they are his main demographic or something, but there is definately a girlish tone to this CD. It probably makes sense to buy, but Don't have expectations of greatness. This CD is not like a rush of blood to the head type sophmore CD."
3,Somewhat of a letdown,"This album is a fair album. Which is almost trash compared to his first 3 albums. Especially Room for Squares and Inside the Square. There are a few good songs on the album.. #2 Bigger Than My Body is really good. #4 New Deep sounds good also, and #9 Only Heart is very good. But other than that there are hardly any decent songs on the album. The way he's changed from the acoustic and semi-electric... to this funk or whatever he'd like to call it. And then some of it is killer to listen to. Such as Come Back to Bed and songs like that. They're too slow... not like acoustic slow but old and boring slow. It's a shame he couldnt even come close to topping Room For Squares. The songs on Heavier Things are either too funk or way too slow. There isnt a balance at all. He needs to make more songs like My Stupid Mouth and Why Georgia. Songs like that and a few acoustic songs are what I liked."
2,David Baerwald??,"Does this not sound exactly like David Baerwald? It is so similiar and the riffs, vocals and keys are him to a ""T"". Baerwald was forgotten and probably not even noticed in the Moulin Rouge which he spent many songs. This guy has obviously copied him to say the least. Listen to Sirens In the city or colleen and tell me they dont have the same artist!!"
5,Change is Good!,"When you pop in John Mayer's ""Heavier Things,"" the first thing you notice is that it sounds different than his first two studio albums, ""Inside Wants Out"" and ""Room for Squares."" Mayer is trying new tricks with the guitars and percussion, and he's also introducing instruments that haven't been heard on previous efforts.While change can be bad for some people, for Mayer, this is a good thing; listening to this album shows how he has matured as a musician over the years. For example, ""Clarity,"" the first song on the album, has some brass instruments and a piano, and it starts a repeating trend of mostly laid back music, the kind of music that you could cruise to at 3 a.m..Don't get me wrong; there's still some vintage Mayer in there, but it's not dominating, which makes it worth the money. An excellent follow-up by Mr. Mayer."
5,Even Better than Room for Squares.,"I didn't know about John Mayer's new album until the day before it was released. Needless to say, I was excited. Every song on it is fabulous. If I had to pick a few stand-outs though, I would choose Something's Missing, New Deep, and Only Heart. I highly recommend this cd to John Mayer fans and fans of good music in general."
3,Deja vu,"Remember when John Mayer used to go by his other name, Dave Matthews? Looks like human cloning became legal in the music biz.I challenge you all to find any difference between Mayer and Matthews.Mayer...plays the samesings the samedances the same.He is a little ant marching, antennae waving, doing it the same."
1,Heavier than dark matter,"If you like grind, you will love this cd. John Mayer belts out the most dense, skullcrushing riffs of all time on this cd. I would saiy it's even heavier than ISIS - Mosquito control, but that would be hyperbole. Suffice to say that this is one of the heavier cds of whatever year this cd came out."
2,When Did Murmuring Become Singing?,"For those fans who are so enamored of John Mayer, I would like to know: Do they understand what it means to sing a song? John Mayer does not sing: he murmurs. I don't know anything about his music--whether he writes it, produces it--or is just the sounding board. However, from all the songs I have heard on the radio, I have yet to hear him ""sing"" a single note. News Flash for John's fans: It doesn't take talent to whisper sexily into a microphone with background music playing--which is all I have ever heard Mr. Mayer doing. If his fans think this style is so ""unique"", go to any smokey hotel lounge on a Saturday night. I've heard karaoke singers do better than this."
1,.....,"I usually type VERY long reviews, but I'm not even going to waste my time on this DMB impersonating little boy. And DMB is my favorite band. His music doesn't sound anything like DMB, but watch the stupid boy perform. God..."
2,Very disappointing,"This CD was a huge letdown.I liked a few songs on his ""Room for Squares"" but was completely unaffected by everything on this album save for ""Charity,"" a great song.He's at the forefront of the male singer/songwriter thing right now in terms of popularity, but others are producing much better CDs. Try Patrick Park's ""Loneliness Knows my Name,"" Joseph Arthur's ""Redemption's Son,"" or Gavin DeGraw's ""Chariot"" instead."
2,"Like song #3 on the CD say's, ""something's missing"".","The CD starts out strong with ""Clarity"". After that you can eject this one from the CD player and save yourself the frustration. After a very fine effort in ""Room for Squares"", I find this work lacking inspiration. There is nothing to grab onto or cause the listener to take notice of the songs on this CD , save for track number one."
1,Pretentious and god awful,"I didn't think John Mayer could get any worse. The pretentious, arrogant shlock along with Mayer's nasal whiny whispering nearly put me close to suicide. Mayer's ego is the one thing that keeps him around. If he writes his own material, he should send that stuff to artists who are more talented then him. If you are looking for someone more talented, check out Jason Mraz, Clay Aiken, or Norah Jones."
1,Why are we even talking about this guy?,"This is not MUSIC. This is some monosylabilic drone-head who has nothing interesting to offer.ROCK MUSIC AFICIANADOS: DO NOT SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF MUSIC!THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF GROUPS YOU LOVED AND LISTENED TO FROM THE '70's and '80's WHO ARE STILL TOURING AND STILL DESERVING OF YOUR DOLLARS.RE-BUY THOSE BELOVED OLD ALBUMS. Replace your tape collection with new CD copies of ZZ Top, Autograph, Cinderella, Night Ranger, April Wine, Steppenwolf, even the BEATLES for heck's sake.IF YOU BUY INTO THESE IDIOTs, IT WILL ONLY ENCOURAGE THE RECORD COMPANIES TO GIVE YOU MORE, EVEN MORE MEDIOCRE MUSIC. STAND UP AND SHOUT, WE WANT REAL ROCK MUSIC, not schlep like this."
3,"Good music, boring voice","John Mayer is an excellent songwriter and the music is very good, but his voice is boring and he needs to mix it up a bit. I know he's cute, but the voice irritates me. Change it up a little and get some more variety."
2,No Room For Heavier Things,"I've been a long time fan since John was just underground music before he became this pop star. Room For Squares was my favorite album the year it came out, but this new album is quite a dissapointment. ""Only Heart"" is the oly really good song on it. ""Something's Missing"" is missing quite a bit in comparison to the live album. I find a few of the songs just plain annoying such as the opening track. If you plan on getting this album don't expect much."
1,Did not perform up to potential,"I am a huge John Mayer fan, especially of his live recordings. I was surprised by this record as he does not appear take his musical arrangements to the next step. John's first cd speaks to a potential filled with songs infused with funk, melodic lines, intelligent lyrics and thoughful composition. He did not perform up to his potential.What he delivered was what one would expect from a 10 day studio session, during which 9 new songs were created due to record label pressure to get the new songs out. Unlike his first record, these songs were not road tested... they are not the finely crafted product of a young adult's life. Rather, they are nice, boring pop songs, with very little original composition or inspired development.He can do so much better and I am sure he knows it. The guy needs to take some time off from nearly 1.5 years on the road and push himself to produce art that is truly inspired and creative."
1,now I feel better,"Before I read the reviews on here, I was honestly wondering: DOES ANYONE REALLY LIKE THIS MUSIC? Let's face it, John's a cute kid and MTV/VH1-ready and his voice is solid -- but he really is an awfully dull songwriter. By track 3 of tuneless earnest droning, I had to hit EJECT. I think internet downloading and ""Greatest Hits"" CDs were invented for John Mayer."
3,Heavier things...indeed,"I listened to this John Mayer CD before his first one, and I can definitely say that this one is better. Heavier Things is one of those CD's where only every second song is good. My favourites are: 'Clarity', 'Bigger than my body', 'Daughters', 'Homelife' and 'Only Heart'. The rest are pretty good until they hit the chorus. He seems to do really well with his verses and then the bomb drops. On 'Split Screen Sadness' you just want to kill yourself when he sings: ""Two wrongs make it all right"". The same goes for 'Something's Missing' when he's singning about his cheesy checklist. It's kind of funny and cute but also very cringe-worthy. Still, no matter how lame his lyrics may seem, there is somehting about John Mayer that I love. He has a really cool, smoky voice, and songs like 'Clarity' and 'Homelife' make you aching for more. It's a huge improvement from ""Room for Squares"" and with time, Mayer's cheesiness could make him a delicious musician."
2,disappointed,"I LOVED every song on ""Room For Squares"" and most all in ""Inside Wants out"". This album was a huge disappointment to me. The lyrics on ""Room For Squares"" were much more thought out. I would like to see better writing and more originality on the next album!"
5,great album,"I've been reading reviews of this album and how people are disappointed and I would like to point out its virtues. First of all, this album is softer, sweeter, and sexier than his first one. It's more jazzy than rock and more mellow than pop. I've been listening to it everyday since it came out, and to me that indicates that its great. Everyone has an album they hardly listened to, and not only that but has only one good song on it, and I believe that this album will stand the test of time (at least to me). Track 1 is beautiful as well as all of the other songs. I guess the only song I don't care for is &quot;Daughter.&quot;"
4,This is a pretty album...,"This is a very solid album. It is somewhat less slickly produced that Mayer's debut album, but is still very well recorded and clear. It overall has a warmer sound.The songs are generally melodically interesting, perhaps more so than RFS, and the guitar work is very lyrical throughout. This is good, as Mayer is an exceptional guitar player. The first three tracks are uptempo (relatively) and catchy. There is a lull for a few tracks. The last two are split: ""Only Heart"" is uptempo and has a strong chorus, while ""Wheel"" is moves slowly and is a sweet lullaby (the guitar following Mayer's voice is so elegant).I recently reviewed Sting's latest album ""Sacred Love"" and called it a stinker. This album wins for all the reasons Sting's doesn't: It is not pretentious, is focused on songs, and is satisfied with being pop. First rate pop."
3,Oh no John PLEASE NO,"After buying his first ""out of this world"" cd i quickly idolized mayer for his creative chords, and mesmerizing voice.. room for squares was a masterpeice. Listening to it for 3 straight months, then when i heard a second cd was out, i was sure to be the first people to get it.. but to my disappointment the cd was not nearly what i had expected, all of his songs were one paced and the creativity was at an all time low.. i still idolize him as a great pop artist, but i felt he should have put victoria into this cd to give it a little more taste."
5,outstanding,"It's like the first album, only everything sounds better (Better studio production). If your a john mayer fan or a guitar fan in general, you will love this album. There seems to be more of a focus on not only his guitar work but his singing as well. The only drawback for me personally was that the drumming really took a backseat on this album as opposed to the first. The drumming on the first album really complemented john mayer's music perfectly adding alot of flavor to the music. To me the drumming on the new album was toned down quite a bit and the songs while still excellent, dont have quite the same feel as on the first album. I gave it a 5 though since this is john mayer's cd and his singing and guitar work only gets better and better."
4,Great second album,"This is a great follow-up album for John Mayer. The sound is definitely less pop oriented, and more rock oriented, bringing a more mature feel to the album. My favorites are ""Something's Missing"", a great introspective kind of song, ""Bigger Then My Body"", the first single from the album, it's a very feel-good start of the day kind of song, ""Come Back to Bed"", a very sweet love song, and ""Wheel"", a bittersweet ballad that ends the album nicely and makes you want to listen to the whole thing again. Overall, I would recommend this album to any John Mayer fan, as well as anyone who might have been turned off by his earlier pop-oriented album."
4,.........who the?....what the.?......ahhhhhh .....,"One night as I was so bored and lying on my bed surfing through the channels, I stopped and heard this song.......it was somewhat haunting but in a way soothing. I just got back from an insane day from the office and this sound really made me relax and left a really big smile in my face. The video was simple which was exactly what I need to relax. That haunting yoddle really stayed in my head.....soothing. I then recognize the voice and wasn't surprised at all that it was John Mayer. This guy is incredably talented as a performer and songwriter. He is also one of those outstanding acoustic guitar virtuosos. I can't wait for the next album."
2,Rather uninspired,"I decided to check out this album due to all the buzz. I was rather disappointed. Mayer may write his own songs, but that's hardly admirable when those songs are uninspired and boring. Lyrically, there are some bright spots, but musically, this album just drags. I would have liked to have seen Mayer challenge himself a bit more. The album feels like he's just phoning it in."
1,*Yawn*,"What a big yawn this record is. There is nothing and I do mean NOTHING that is appealing about this record. Anybody who rates this cd 2 stars or more, need to get off the caffeine. Currently, I am being tortured everyday because one of my co-workers keep playing this record. And listening to JM, puts me asleep. *YAWN* There she go again----time for a nap. *YAWN*"
2,The cover says it all,"John Mayer WAS a great acoustic guitarist. Look at the cover, it says it all. He's holding an electric guitar. Then listen to the cd and you even struggle to hear that above the annoying keyboard riffs. Everyone else says this album sucks because its more of the same. I disagree. It sucks becasue Mayer tried to do something different."
1,The same drivel on each track.,"I'm a huge John Mayer fan. So much of a fan that I bought into the hype surrounding this album. There is a certain level of originality I came to expect, perhaps foolishly, of John Mayer- it was not delivered with Heavier Things.Hearing John Mayer sing about the SAME THING (wanting a family, for example) track after track was terribly disappointing. But not nearly as disappointing as the hype surrounding this album. What you see is not what you get. It was mechanically put together and generically bland. But perhaps I'm just bitter about setting myself up for disappointment. I have hope that John Mayer will either return to his former real, raw sound, or listen to his own lyrics, stop writing music, and get that family he really seems to desire."
5,One of the best albums I bought this year.,This has to be one of the better albums I bought this year. It has a lot of nice acoustics and doesn't have inappropriate lyrics.
2,Had higher hopes,This CD just wasn't as good as his previous work. I may be a little biased since I've seen him play at random bars on Friday nights before he became popular. But it was his acoustic style that has kept me a devoted listener. This CD is much more synthesized. The songs don't have the meaning to the average listener that they have before. Many seem to be about budding fame which is not something I can relate too. Guess it is hard to still be the average Joe when you become a big star.
1,CANNOT IMPORT TO iTUNES!!!!!!!!!!,"PLEASE NOTE THAT UNLESS YOU HAVE A DVD-RW DRIVE AND KNOW THE WORKAROUND, YOU CANNOT CANNNOT IMPORT CD audio INTO iTUNES.NOTE 2: I dont know how to import the DVD audio, so I cant comment on that.Not Amazon's fault, but be forewarned - if you like your iPod, this disc does NOT.Amazon still rocks - but PLEASE put some sort of warning about this issue so that this doesn't happen to others!!--BB"
4,Hard act to follow,"I see a few of you have decided to dump on this latest offering.While I agree, there seem to be a few 'filler' tunes on this project, (at first or second listen), the ones that are good are extremely good. I won't mention them by name because my taste is different than yours but it's obvious Mr. Mayer is a major player who has just begun what I believe will be a long and brilliant career. Ya gotta admit, Room for Squares was one of those rare bodies of work that was great front to back. Hard act to follow.I guess the highest compliment I can pay him is I believe he is an American Nik Kershaw.Don't hesitate to buy this CD...true players deserve our money."
4,Pretty good,"I had such high expetations for this album and that it probably why I was a little dissappointed at first listen. I gave it another chance and changed my mind. I like the slow songs the best especially with guitar solos. I saw him live a few weeks ago and he is an amazing guitarist. This album is not as good as Room for Squares, but it is worth purchasing if you are a John Mayer fan. Best song is either Daughters or Clarity. The only thing that is better on this album from last are the lyrics."
3,Second Try,"After the first few listens to the new John Mayer I'd have to say two words, Over Produced! Having said that, I liked it better the more I heard it but still feel that the songs from #5 on are cleaner and more like his previous effort. A bit to much electronica and vocals are overshadowed by the production. Still like him and his style, but wish it were more organic than it is commercial. Changing producers might have been the first mistake."
2,Nothing Heavier here,"I was hoping John would go for something a little different with his second album, or at least that it would live up to it's title ""Heavier Things"", unfortunately this album does neither. I was hoping we would get at least one or two guitar heavy tracks (since John has been credited as being such an outstanding guitarist), but here we get enough samples and loops to qualify this CD as pop. If you're looking for a repeat of Room For Squares that's what you get here, for many that will be an excellent thing, for me it wasn't."
2,Stick to the originals,"This album is clearly not classic John Mayer style. If you like very pop-like music, then you may enjoy it, but personally, I think it's very disappointing. If you like John Mayer because he sounds different from everyone else, then save your money on this one. There is way too much extra noise in the songs that takes away from his voice and guitar. I'd definitely stick to his old stuff. This album has no heart, and is very stereotypical pop sounding."
5,A great cd,This truly was a great cd. Heavier things was definitely a big change from Room For Squares but its a change for the better!
5,ATTENTION JOHN MAYER FANS...,"Let me introduce you to the next John Mayer: www.TeddyGeigerMusic.comThis cd is great. John Mayer has the artistic talent and charisma to be a star. Teddy shares the qualities, check him out."
1,SiCKoEs*~,"I can't handle this CD. It's sick. I honestly can't even take it. John Mayer is so ugly and his ""great guitar playing"" in no way makes up for the total lack of originality. The words ""come back to bed"" make me cringe when I hear them drifting through my wall. I can't even believe I have to be subjected to this music."
3,Room For Squares was sooooo much better!,"Being the conformist i am, i bought the first John Mayer CD and absolutely loved the mellow acoustic guitar jams and that voice! So, i expected this one to be very similar. Unfortunately, it is kind of boring and very reptitive. This was a waste of a shoplifted CD! Stick with the old stuff!"
2,"John Mayer ""Heavier Things""","""Clarity"" 3/5""Bigger Than My Body"" 4/5""Something's Missing"" 2/5""New Deep"" 2/5""Come Back To Bed"" 2/5""Home Life"" 1/5""Split Screen Sadness"" 2/5""Daughters"" 1/5""Only Heart"" 3/5""Wheel"" 1/5John Mayer tries to distance himself from the Dave Matthews similarities with this release. This, however, doesn't really come off as a good idea. The album, in my opinion, is very boring in parts and many of the songs sound similar. ""Bigger Than My Body"" is really the only standout to me, maybe ""Clarity"" as well.Overall rating: Two stars"
5,goos second effort,"i actually like this album better than room for squares, which i felt lacked continuity, and some songs were mind blowing, while others were duds. on the new album, there is not one song i don't like and i can listen to the album start to finish on my drive home every day from work. it's a more multi- faceted album, with different layers musically, obviouslly due to its mixing. Homelife is my favorite song on heavier things, but as a sophmore album, i would say its an outstanding effort."
4,Less Radio Friendly = Better,"Mayer displays some versatility in his sophomore effort ""Heavier Things"". He takes his music and writing in a slightly different direction which may not please those who got hooked on his very pop, radio friendly debut ""Room for Squares"". Gone for the most part are the cheesy lyrics. A nice addition is the use of a trumpet in ""Clarity"" and ""Come Back to Bed"". There is still a little to much going on in some of his songs. Mayer should rely more on his guitar playing ability, since he is quite good. Overall his 2nd CD is improvement from the first and though it does stray from what made his first CD so sucessful it doesnt go to far as to alienate his current fan base."
4,Will bring a smile to your face :),"I have all of JM CD's they are my favorite CD's for long trips. When we first got this one I didn't like it as much as Room For Squares but it grew on me in no time.My favorite tracks are #2 Bigger Than my Body, #3 Something's Missing, #7 Split Screen Sadness and FAVORITE of all #10 Wheel. I love the fact that when you purchase this CD there is a insert with a attitude gage, like what kind of mood the songs were written in, where HE was when he wrote the songs etc. It is really kind of fun and whimsical that is one thing that I love about John Mayer's music style is that it always makes me smile and sway with the music.This probably will not be on anyone's top 10 list if you don't like whimsical music that just makes you feel good, I mean if you are the type of person to pick things apart because of range, complexity etc then avoid this CD it's very reminiscent of nice days and as the CD insert directs you.Respectfully Reviewed"
1,Columbia ruined this kid,"Having loved John's earlier work. I cannot tell you how disappointing this album is. It's not the soulful sound of his earlier stuff. The songs all sound the same. Musically lame, mixed for radio crap.It's sounds like a talented artist trapped in a recording contract with no creative control."
3,Its ok.,"This cd is ok. Any of you who dare to think that John Mayer is the ""New Dave"" or refer to him as ""better then dave"" are sorely mistaken. Dave is and always will be a pioneer, even with carpal tunnel syndrome. Someone younger then John and much more gifted to give him a run for his money is Howie Day. If you havent checked him out, do so now. I have been seeing him live since he was 18. Freakin' awesome.Anyways, this cd - good, but not great. Def worth a listen, nowhere near as good as Room For Squares, but even that album was a little more pop then Johns earlier roots version of some songs and his older music in general. People that are saying it is horrible, are wrong, and people that are saying its the hottest thing out, are also wrong. It is well produced and the a little more mature then the last album.Anyways, check out Howie Day if you like ""old"" John Mayer."
5,AWESOME!,"John Mayer is one of the best artists ever! I really love this cd. I liked his others, but this is my favorite.My favorite song is ""come back to bed"", i love his use of the trumpets in the song. he has a wonderful voice. I'd say that there are no bad songs on this cd. They are all of his feelings, and it's cool that he can express himself in such an open way. He is mysterious in his songs, but he also has a way to just make you open up and cry along with him! 2 thumbs up!"
3,Other directions...,"This cd certainly have some highlights... like ""new deep"" BUT all songs had been handle with the same formula. I loved his first cd but this one seems to be a ""sell out"" cd. sticky lyrics (they were on the first one too but was more original), strange lirycs only he can understand.Maybe is just a false step, he have the talent I hope he can work on it."
3,Make Room For Heavier Things,"I enjoyed Room For Squares as much as the next John Mayer fan, but I think if I had gotten another RFS album, I would have been disappointed. This here is a decent album, but it does have too much of a pop element when maybe he should have gone more with the blues and jazz element that's seen a little here. I'm sure by the next album he'll figure out what he wants to do, though. Just a little note to future reviewers, please give the album a fair rating. Just because you do/don't like it doesn't change its value. Different strokes for different folks, ya know?"
4,"Et tu Brutus??? How quickly we turn...tsk, tsk...","So it's not Room For Squares. So what? It's still John Mayer. Still his voice. Still his lyrics. Still his sound. The Pyramids weren't built in a week. It took time to build them, and look, they're still here; they've stood the test of time. The same thing will happen with John Mayer. 10 years from now, we'll all laugh at how we so easily dismissed this album. Look at U2 (my most favorite band of all time), it took them 3 or 4 albums before the world realized their relevance to music. This guy has talent. It has and will continue to evolve. Listen to this album a few more times. And then a few more after that. You'll want to stay on to see where the rest of the journey will take you. It will be most rewarding, trust me. I've been a fan of U2 since their War album. I've been along for the ride ever since and now look at what they have accomplished as musicians. 'Nuff said!"
3,Heavier Indeed,"Not completely shedding his pop persona quite yet, Mayer's ""Heavier Things"" is still a much better album that his freshman effort.This album represents much more complex arrangements and a deeper lyrical effort that focuses more on emotion than visuals.There are several highlights on this album including Clarity and Come Back to Bed, amongst others."
3,Interesting live act,"I really liked this album from the first listening. The music sweeps over you and you find yourself lost in the rythyms and richness on the sound. I saw the band live the other night. Warren Ellis who looks like a homeless person with his beard, long hair and misshapen corduroy jacket plays with his back to the audience and is extremely captivating to watch. His banter between songs is amusing. They are a bunch of old pro who know how to play together. The concert was 2 hours and I found myself at the end of the night almost before I reaslised it. This is music that drags you in."
3,Good but not great,"These are interesting stories that cover a very wide range of experiences. That is not quite what I was looking for. In a book titled bound for love, I expected more stories involving actual physical bondage. The first story certainly provided some of this experience, but the other stories provided only psychological bondage, or none. Great cover picture (of course the bondage is implied rather than real, maybe that is a clue?)."
4,bought two,On reading a review I decided that I should buy one for myself and one for a friend as we're both crazy about words. Have had a look through mine and it's funny and clever so shall send the other to my friend for her birthday.
2,Voit CB5 Flat,I purchased 4 of the Voit CB5 balls for our church basketball league. The size of the ball is perfect for ages 4 - 6. 2 of the 4 ball will not hold air. I pump the balls up before each practice and game. The church purchased 4 balls 3 years back and they have been good balls. Very disappointed in the 2 balls that do not hold air.
2,"The size my son needed, but went flat after 2 weeks","The ball went flat after only 2 weeks. It was the perfect size ball for my 5 year old son, but it didn't last."
4,Great quality for the price.,"Worked really well (grip, kept its shape, quality and bounce) until I ran over the ball with my SUV accidentally."
3,Simply Refreshing,"When it really comes to music these days, there is really no backbone to what should actually stand out. That just sometimes surprises me with newer acts out there. Jet, is one of those newer acts right now. Their U.S. debut single, Are You Gonna Be My Girl?, from their U.S. debut record, Get Born, is actually quite refreshing within itself. Although as it begins, it sounds quite repetitive to an Iggy Pop song at the very beginning. Still, the song does quickly catch on with its feel. Arguably, it does seem a little out of place from the beginning, but does actually catch on very well once you get used to it. Although many aren't still familiar with Jet, they do have some growth, but a very catchy beat within Rock N' Roll."
1,Annoying tripe,"People who find this song ""refreshing"" must love the sound of fingernails on a blackboard. Trite lyrics randomly jammed into a line of music...what talent! The only reason it gets one star is that the basic tune doesn't completely suck, & that's no thanks to Jet."
1,Typical corporate rock,"This sounds like something written by/for a fake band in a movie or a TV show. It doesn't rock -- it pretends to rock. Iggy Pop wannabes striving to create a commercial sound. I hear that starting a business in hopes of getting bought by Microsoft is now an accepted business practice. I liken music like this to the same mentality: ""Let's write cheesy corporate rock and maybe we'll get placed in an iTunes commercial."""
1,I hate this song.,"I like a few songs from Jet's album, but this song just sucks! And giving this 1 star is being generous. The damn song is annoying as hell. I'm done here."
2,Stones do not have the color shown correctly,"The stones in these earrings are a lot paler than shown in the picture. If the earrings had been accurately depicted, I would not have purchased them."
1,THIS TOY STINKS,THIS IS THE MOST BORING TOY EVER! My daughter got sick of it in 5 minutes and she hasn't used it since last month! I asked her why she never uses it and she said that it is so boring because it is broken! It's a waste of money!
5,Great toy for my little 2 year old,"I bought this toy for Christmas for my 2 year old. Shes doesn't know enough yet to do all the games, but she's learning fast. She loves to hear Barbie's voice, and will sit down often with this toy so she can learn. It has about 8 different games. Letter games to teach letters, and sounds, a vowel game to learn about vowels, number games, and music games. Its great to have a learning toy that keeps my kids coming back again and again."
3,Classic Dalek Story,"This is it--the origin of the Doctor's worst enemies, the Daleks. This is good old-fashioned space opera, with the added touch of a Doctor uncertain if he has the right to decide the fate of the universe (something that will trouble him less and less in the future). A competent retelling of the TV show."
4,Goodnight Mr Tom,What a wonderful story about a boy and a lonely man. How a boy called William becomes a healthy stable boy in the care of Mr Tom. The story is based in the World in England. Children being sent to the country. The friendships that are made and the drama of war. A very touching story that had emotions coming to the surface. Thoroughly enjoyed it.

2,Not what I expected,"I was very unhappy with the product. They looked used and were not the color I wanted. My plan was to use them daily to mark seating location in my music classroom, but they move easily and it 's difficult to find anything that will keep them in place. Velcro doesn't even work. Not to mention they are ugly."
4,"Interesting, but not the best Jean Plaidy book I've read!","I enjoyed this book, particularly because I wanted to learn more about Mary, Queen of Scots and what better person to learn from than Jean Plaidy!? Like most of the Plaidy books, it is history couched in novel form. My only complaint that it seemed a little stiffer than most of her novels, a little more rigid and it didn't flow quite as naturally. Nevertheless, it told the story and told it well. I recommend it!"
3,The Continuing Story of Mary Queen of Scots,"This is the continuing story of Mary, Queen of Scots, after her disastrous marriage to Bothwell. The novel opens with Mary the captive of her half-brother, Jamie. She finds that there are still subjects who want to follow her, and they help her escape to England. When she arrives, she finds herself the captive of Elizabeth I, and spends the next 20 years in captivity.This is an intriguing story about Mary. Although the book drags in many parts, it is still interesting to find out what happened to Mary following her loss of the throne. She continues to fascinate as the counterpoint to the magnificent Elizabeth."
4,they should have ten thousand million version of this computer rhythm!,"this is perhaps one of the most overlooked (if not hated) albums in lee 'scratch' perry's extensive discography. i think, though, that it is one of his absolute best. the production is extremely simple, casio-style synthesized rhythms. at first, this can be a bit grating, but give it some time, it may well grow on you. its really perfectly fitting with scratch's pro-technology & anti-reggae worldview and his sense of absurdity. but whatever you say about the production, lee is absolutely at his best here. and when lee is on, really, he can make the sounds of a faucet dripping or that of a toy store keyborad on 'demo' mode sound good. some of the greatest and silliest lyrics of his career are found here and the strength and brilliance of his personality really shines through. 'angel gabriel and the space boots'? c'mon, where else are you gonna find songs like that."
2,Not enough Skynyrd,"I'd just like to say that there just aint enough Skynyrd on this compilation. I do like The Allman Brothers Band but one song from the Skynyrd, the greatest southern rock band of all time come on. And why is it that on all these ""southern rock"" or ""classic rock"" compilations for Skynyrd they always put in songs like Sweet Home Alabama or Free Bird? I love those songs (especially Free Bird) but they're getting played out and that does no good for the band. They should put songs like The Needle and the Spoon on there."
1,southern rock,i waited and waited but i didnt ever get it they did give me my money back but they wasnt the point i really wanted it
2,Without Molly Hatchet & Blackfoot...you ain't got much.,"Anytime you overlook Molly Hatchet & Blackfoot when your talking Southern Rock, you overlook a major portion of the hard drivin, butt thumpin down south style."
5,Awesome!,"We offered it to my friend who was getting married, as a joke, but the game was so great that everybody wanted to play!!!It's so easy to play, and it looks really good..."
3,From Back Cover,"Hotshot P.I. Steve Hart specialized in missing-persons cases, surfung and passionate, sexy brunettes. Not necessarily in that order.Gorgeous, dark-haired Willow Ryan hired Steve to find her birth father, who'd once lived at Bachelor Arms. She needed his detecting skills, but the intrepid investigator seemed more intent on showing her his lovemaking skills. Until the 'accidents' started...Someone didn't want Steve and Willow asking questions. Especially about that scandalous night over twenty years ago. A night that changed the lives of everyone at Bachelor Arms...Ninth in the Bachelor Arms series"
4,SOMETHING NICE to listen to on a cold rainy/wintry night...,"etta is an unfairly overlooked singer. here, she displays her warm bluesy command of equally overlooked standards like ""through a long and sleepless night"" and ""love is the thing."" this is the perfect album to curl up with on a cold, rainy/wintry night, or anytime you feel the need to sing the blues along with someone who's clearly been there herself.."
5,A wonderful book for a baby or small child,"I really loved this book. The colors are bright, which catches a baby's attention. The print is big, which allows small children to see it. And the illustrations are terrific, the bugs are adorable. I would highly recommend this book for a baby or small child"
2,not at all educational,"i expected this book to teach about different bugs. it does not. one picture shows a bug reading and reads: ""some bugs like to be quiet"". this is confusing to a child learning about the world."
5,Batok is the man!,"I am a music composer and I have found the essays by Bartok compiled in this book very interesting and helpful. For example, there are several essays describing how Bartok organized many of his compositions. There are also several essays describing different types of folk music such as American, Rumanian, and Hungarian. There is an essay on the 'So-called Bulgarian Rhythm.' I definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learing about different types of folk music or anything about Bela Bartok and is compositions."
1,Do not buy if published by ClassicBooksAmerica,"The one-star rating is for the third-rate publisher: ClassicBooksAmerica. This Amazon.com product page lists the publisher as CreateSpace, but the book image (and preview) shown is from ClassicBooksAmerica.The text is riddled with typographical errors: a lot of spelling mistakes and the Yen/Yuan symbol, , throughout the text (a type-setting blunder).Caveat emptor/lector: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS EDITION."
2,Below standard,Too much of the white pith on this orange peel making the product overly bitter and diluting the real good taste of the orange zest.
5,A Wonderful Journey,"I have watched this DVD and while I haven't made any of the projects, I intend to. The format of this DVD is just like taking a class. You get the supply list up front and then you start with easy step by step instructions. Tim also offers extra samples at the end of each session to show you more possibilities. I can't wait to order his second Journey to add to my collection and learn some more. You can actually make the projects shown in this DVD."
5,An Altered Journey with Tim Holtz,What an inspiration this DVD is. Many new techniques along wtih some twists to some not so new. Tim is fun to watch and hear. His step by step instructions are great. A must have for any stamper/scrapper.
5,Perfect size,"I have a sun consure and a Marvelous XL chateau cage. I needed perches that Max could use as ""bridges"" from one area to the next, these work great. They are perfect size for his feet, he loves the bell and unlike some other ""bells"" it actually rings, and the length of the perch is perfect at 10"". It's sturdy, easily attached and attractive."
2,"Ok, not great","This is a very factual account of Eric Liddell's life, but there are better accounts out there. A bit dry to follow."
3,3 psi error,"I bought 5 gauges and use them to determine when my filters need to be changed. When my pump is on I check the presurre drop after the filter. When the pump is off they should all read the same, but there is a 3 psi varience among the 5 gauges. If you want a cheap gauge to give you a general idea of what is going on, this is a good buy. If a 3 psi error is too much, then you should buy a different gauge."
4,Fine product,Right now it works fine----but will it stand the test of time?I will get back to you in about 10 years.
1,Doesn't work,"I just hooked up one of these to my residential supply, and it is reporting 10psi. Pretty sure that isn't right. Good thing I purchased three. Maybe the other two work."
3,Didn't impress me...,I'd read some favorable reviews of this CD and decided to pick it up. After several listenings I can't say that I'm disappointed but I'm not impressed either. The impression that sticks with me is of Natalie Merchant singing Tori Amos songs. The CD could probably have benefitted from a different producer. All the tracks sort of run together and sound more alike than different.
2,Not for commercial ue,"I purchased two of these rubber hoses for the simple reason that it had ""commercial"" as a part of the product description. Unfortunately these hoses did not last long under heavy foot / vehicle traffic. The hose ruptured rather easily. It's rubber all the way through. This is a good hose if you are needing something to sit around the house and water your petunias. If you need it to wash your car where it might get run over, move over to soemthing a little more rugged."
3,leaks,"I kept this hose even though the female end connection leaked on first use. I purchased a 3/4"" ID hose bib and now have maximum flow."
2,Not as Great at Handling Pressure as it Seems!,"I bought it because I needed a strong commercial-grade hose that could handle the pressure of a being attached to an irrigation well, and the water left on and feeding into a high-quality nozzle. I had this hose for only a few weeks, and it developed a bubble/blister near the female end, luckily we caught it before it ruptured. Switched a a 10-ply hose from a local commercial pressure-washer dealer. This hose was definitely not worth what we paid."
3,Lasted 18 months,I bought this hose in June 2011. It worked very well initially and I have been very pleased with it. Recently it appears to have developed what I think is a dissecting aneurysm (local swelling with a lot of turbulence) so it won't drain properly (which is a lethal flaw when using it to fill stock tanks in our Minnesota winters). I'm considering an 8 ply flexogen hose as a replacement.
3,Flimsy,I bought this to run up from the lake where my sprinkler pump is to the back yard.It works ok for that but it feels flimsy and kinks easily. I would hate to have to more this around or coil it after each use. But for using it in a straight run to transport water like I am it works alright.
1,unhappy,the package was all damaged when i received it. it was not worth the effort to send it back. very unhappy customer
3,Couldn't get past the relationship,"I'm sorry I know they are not blood but I couldn't get past the age, uncle, or the fact that he was described as looking like Sam. It just creeped me out. The book was good but every time I thought I had placed the above factors out of my mind the author brought them back up. The story was interesting to see how they made it through the time apart and stayed connected."
3,First attempt at romance novel?,"I bought this book because I loved the first one and wanted to continue to read about the children. I didn't want to read about their emerging sex lives! It's just weird when you feel like you get to know a character as a child, and then have graphic details about their sex life. It's like knowing the details of your own child's sex life- yuk! The writing and the story line were good, albeit frustrating and it seeming like the author was just trying her hand at romance writing- very amateurish. Perhaps that added to my embarrassment while reading it. I read the whole thing, bought the next in the series and hoped for different with the 3rd book."
3,not as good as Book 1,"I enjoyed Book 1, got hooked into the McRae family, but was successively disappointed with books 2 & much moreso with book 3. As I said in an earlier review, I kept reading because I'd bought the series and hoped the author would get back to the kind of writing she did in book 1. As it turned out, book 4 did turn a corner; overall, to me it seemed like a rewriting of book 1 with characters who grew up and changed situations but not patterns."
4,fun followup story,The series is a good one! Looking forward to reading the others. Will buy in series format next time for savings.
3,does age matter?,"Does age really matter? Maybe if there is a 15 year age gap? How about if the heroine, Emma, is 18 and the hero, Rhy is 33? This was a sweet romance with a bit of the hard hitting issues like domestic abuse, this case boyfriend abuse, thrown in for some drama. I liked that the two characters had chemistry and the fact that they didn't consumate the relationship until she had some time to grow up. Didn't seem like such a large gap in their ages then. Funny though because it was still a 15 year gap but perhaps people feel when you are a bit older you know more about what you are doing and have experienced life a bit more."
5,"This one is a ""desert island"" keeper!","The Edge of Heaven does what a good romance is supposed to do: it weaves a good story around great characters and leaves you feeling good when you are finished. This is my first Hill book and not only did I read it in one night-- I can't wait to read 12 Days, the book that preceeds this story. If you are looking for a great romance in the style of Lavyrle Spencer this book is it."
4,I liked it.,"The story was sweet and interesting twist on love. Had to much detail with the sex parts, I like it when some things are left to your own thoughts. Other than that it was a nice read."
4,"Big, but worth every page - and it reads easy","This books large size is simply due to its large subject. The City of London is a wonderful place that I have been fortunate to visit over a dozen times and plan to visit many more times.In the states we measure the history of buildings and cities in decades and MAYBE a century or two. In London they measure in centuries and maybe a millennium or two (or three).Mr. Inwood takes us through that history with lively prose and keeping the focus on the interesting and the informative without weighing us down with the kind of detail academics seem to love to inflict on themselves. No, this book reads like a book half its size because of the fun we have touring the development of the place and the inhabitants who have taken and left its glorious stage through the centuries.If you know London you will love this book and if you don't know London you will learn to love it through reading this book."
2,Exactly not the type of book I was looking for,"If your interests lie in how many tons of wheat England exported in 1532, this is the book for you. If you looking for a flowing social history of London with interesting side-stories and anecdotes (e.g. ""fun reading""), stay away from this borefest."
5,mISSION uK,I just bought this CD online. I have the original - album version. I got it hot off the press back in the day. This was and is one of my favorite albums.I recommend the Chameleons UK if you like this stuff.
4,8 Out of 10,First off the good:1) Parts were an easy fit and instructions were easy to follow.2) Nice detail in the engine.3) Nice weight.4) The die cast metal parts had a nice paint .Now the bad:1) The rubber spark plug wires were too short to stay in place.2) One part was very fiddly to put into the right orientation to fit into the model.Overall a very nice model and it fitted in next to my 1971 Hemi Cuda very well.It is currently displayed with a scale miniature engine hoist.
2,Gimpy Stride,"Stride piano depends much on precise timing, for its special feeling and stride momentum. This recording, while a nice enough piano instrument and fair audio, is played as if ""Thins"" is sight reading the music. All the notes are there, just not in the right time. After a while it gets tiring, like a series of notes in no particular groupings. In my view, it don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing, and this one ain't got it."
5,Love Tweezerman,"The best part about the Tweezerman brand is their lifetime sharpening guarantee! All of their products are great quality, and that guarantee just makes it 100x better."
2,Reads like a term paper,"As much as I enjoy books of this genre, Gangbusters read like too much of a report. The book was dry, and the overwhelming number of players in the book had me flipping to earlier chapters to see exactly who I was reading about."
4,"Gangbuster: How a street tough, Elite Homicide Took Down New","I once live on Beekman but moved before all the Redtop Yellow top saga really got moving, reading this book let me see what my brother and his kids lived through, Mr. Stone really captured the gang and there doings well"
3,An okay read. . .,"""Gangbusters"" is an okay, but not a great book about criminals. You want a killer read about crime? Try ""Black Mass: The Irish Mob, The FBI and A Devil's Deal"" by Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill. Now that's a wild book. And all true too."
3,Chuck Berry - 'Live At The Fillmore Auditorium' (Mercury),"Haven't heard this CD in ages, so I obviously had to go dig it up. Didn't realize it was from a 1967 concert, ALSO didn't know that Steve Miller (Joker, Fly Like An Eagle) was with Berry at the time. However, this disc won't likely get too many Steve Miller fans all stoked. After all, it IS a Chuck Berry title, pretty much aimed toward the collectors, die-hards and live lp fans (like myself). Tunes I like best were the Chuck Willis gem ""C.C. Rider"", Willie Dixon's ""Hoochie Coochie Man"" and some of Berry's own gold like ""It Hurts Me Too"", ""Wee Baby Blues"" and Mr. Berry's ultimate show-stopper ""Johnny B. Goode"". Line-up: Chuck Berry-guitar & vocals, Steve Miller-guitar, harmonica & vocals, Lonnie Turner-bass, Jim Peterman-organ & piano and Tim Davis-drums. Worth checking out."
3,authentic beauty,"They say that inside every young woman is a princess and she is in search of her Prince Charming.In a culture that mocks longings for tender romance, in a world where fairy tales never come true, do we even dare hope for much more? For every young woman asking that question is an invitation, and in Authentic Beauty Leslie Ludy reveals how you can experience that passion and intimacy you really long for. You can begin a never ending love story with your true Prince. Discover the beauty of a life fully set apart for Him, and you can experience a romance that will transform every part of your existence and fulfill the deepest longest of your heart.Authentic Beauty by Leslie Ludy is a good discussion book for a teenage girls small group at church. Though I am personally in a different stage in life, there's a lot to say for it and the writing is done well. If you'd like some inspiration in focusing on your heart's true love, check this book out."
5,Excellent read for young women,"This book is a must-read for women. It describes how the Christian woman should be set apart for God. Not only that it provides insight on being set apart and pure for your future spouse. As someone who is dating right now, this book has brought encouragement and advice. I would highly recommend every Christian woman to read this. It will speak to your heart."
2,Authentic and yet not,"Authentic Beauty was a disappointing read for me. I thought Leslie Ludy had some wonderful things to say and it is clear that she loves the Lord. However, the book was extremely repetative. I kept expecting her to dive into some really intense issues, but in the end it was all very surface. I'm a college student and i lead a small group of college girls. I got this book thinking it would really challenge us. However, it didn't. This book would best serve younger girls, probably middle school age, who are still learning what it means to follow Christ."
5,Wow!,"I read this book when it first came out and I was completely blown away by the message! It is a powerful book on becoming a girl that is beautiful in the ways that truly matter! Not the way this world sees it. It shows how true beauty dosn't come from the outside, but what is in your heart, a heart dedicated 100% to God and his will for your life! It might be hard to accept some of the issues she address, but in the end it is a beautiful way of life that makes complete sense! Totally surrenderd to God and His will for your life!"
1,endurance(original version) by earle liedman,"This book is not worth the paper it is written on. Very disappointing, no substance, no real idea's. Too much to write that is negative about this book."
3,"Great music, low quality recordings",As a DJ of 20 years I was happy to find such a great quantity of extended mixes on one disc. Unfortunately the copy I purchased seemed lacking in sound quality to the point that I could not use it in a professional setting. Although for personal use what a great collection
4,Most of them are great,"Ah, disco. A music which saw women take center stage on many occasions. I love to put on this collection when I'm biking, it gives me energy to workout and I can sing along. The variety is pretty good, in fact, some of the selections are rather horrible but we can't like everything. This was the second of this series that I purchased and I'm very glad I did. Think I'll go bike and sing ""I Will Survive"" right now."
3,"Ring my bell, From the master tape?","Although I enjoy this collection (I own almost all the titles of it) I must comment that the quality on the ""Ring my bell"" song (on this volume) is not good enough, you can clearly ear the ""typical"" noise of the not-so-well maintained vinyl from which this song was recorded, If you're like me, trying to convert your vinyl collection to CD (from the master tapes) and looking for this Anita Ward's hit song look to other titles (on this site) than can give you the ""real"" one in its full 8:11 min. extended verson, other than this, it's a good title and given its low price I think it's worth the try,"
5,THE BEST DISCO COLLECTION AVAILABLE AND REASONABLY PRICED,"THE DISCO NIGHT COLLECTION WHICH IS MADE UP OF 10 DIFFERENT CD'S IS A DISCO FANS DREAM. THIS COLLECTION FROM REBOUND RECORDS IS VERY HIGH QUALITY WITH NO PHONY ARTIST. THESE ARE THE REAL ARTIST PERFORMING THE BEST AND MOST POPULAR SONGS OF THAT ERA. AT LESS THAN $7.00 THESE DISC'S ARE A STEAL. VOLUME 4 IS MY FAVORITE BECAUSE IT HAS THE CLUB DANCE VERSIONS AND IS GREAT FOR A PARTY.JOHN KEITH DALLAS, TEXAS"
4,"Good collection of Hits, to remind those funny ""Disco Night"" times!","I am a Music fanatic. I really don't care if some people consider Disco music to be a ""Non-musical"" style.Hey, it is always really fun to remind all those ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Thanks God It's Friday"" times!!A lot of good Disco Divas hits are included in this CD. The sound quality is not the best, but if you just turn up the volume and start dancing, this album will work for you!"
5,"Excellent Clarity, nice features","The cam did a really nice job keeping me in touch with my wife who was away for 5 days as part of her Phd program. The kids and I could see and hear her clearly. The only draw back I think for all these notebook cams is the way they mount to the laptop, they have a tendency to slip off easily if the edge of the laptop is rounded over as her is. My compaq presario is more of a square edge and does not preset an issue. The camera even has face tracking software to keep the persons face in the shot..."
2,Make sure your laptop screen is no more than 1/2 inch thick,"I just got mine delivered today and the clip doesn't even fit into my Dell Latitude D810 screen (the screen is about 3/4 inch thick). I must admit, it is a nice little webcam except that it needs a lot of light to operate. I have tried it for about 20 minutes with the webcam sitting on my desk and I could get good video image if I switched on all the lights in my room.Sad to say I have to return this unit!"
4,Good Setup for the Money,"Bought a Powerbook with Tiger OS-X soon after purchase, and the camera, unfortunately, is not compatible. Apparently it works with some of the earlier Mac setups...I really liked how this camera was set-up with the 'now filming' indicator light, plus the face tracking feature was pretty cool as well; you could also adjust the camera settings to compensate for low light conditions.The only thing I didn't care for: the number of startup programs the software seemed to install on my system...I think it loaded up three and they ALL wanted to load immediately when Windows started up; slowed down my old PC quite a bit...There are probably ways around some of that stuff, but it was just one more reason for me to go buy a Macintosh and start to enjoy my computer and internet time again!"
3,Not bad,"The camera is a great size and fits pretty well on my HP laptop. However, there is no ability to zoom out and the coloring is a bit green. The cord is also a bit short to move the camera around much, but overall the product is pretty good. I've used more expensive Logitech desktop cameras and they provide better quality picture, but are much larger."
4,Good webcam for the price,"I bought this webcam about one month ago. I feel pretty good about it. It is easily installed, and video quality is fairly good. One minor glitch is the design of clip used to fix the camera on my notebook. It will take a few trys for you to fix it properly. Overall, I am satisfied with the camera."
2,Mic,I am not sure if I did something wrong but I can't get the mic to work on the Camera. The Camera part works fine.
4,Who designed the clamp? Fire their ass!,"Quality of the video is excellent on Yahoo messenger. The face tracking is so so. Audio is good on messenger. Works great for video mail through Comcast.You can take a snapshot like a digital cam with a button on the unit (once it is clamped down), or hold it and use like digital cam.This would have been 5 stars if the clamp was worth a crap. It is useless out of the box on my Toshiba A75 laptop. It would have been better just to let it hang on the LCD rather than this clamping design. Velcro here we come!"
3,Logitech Quickcam,I like the size of this webcam but it doesn't fit the top of laptops very well. But the pictures & video are good.
4,Good product!,"I really like this camera. The only drawback I found is that you can not tilt/move the camera sideways after it is fixed on the laptop screen. You can move it upside down (but not left to right or vice versa). There are several other cameras including some from Logitech which let you do that. You would be better off getting something which you can move sideways and/or upside down. Right now, I have to move the whole laptop left or right to adjust the picture."
2,Not what I expected!!,"First of all I had to go onto the website for instructions on how to install the software and driver for Windows Vista users. Finally I got it up and running after about a half hour. The webcam didn't track hand movements very well and the video came out really blurry. My built in laptop webcam was much better in that regard. It's good for someone who stays still and just speaks into the video. The camera didn't fit on my laptop and kept falling off, which got really annoying. After a few hours of recieving this product it's now boxed up and ready to be returned."
3,quickcam,"Logitech 961400-0403 Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxenice camera, pictures are clear from close up to about 10 feet away. easy installation."
3,webcam review,I was excited about the webcam with all the great reviews. I was particularly excited about the built in speaker. The speaker is good part about this webcam. List of pitfalls I found so far1) I was showing my apt in the webcam. It froze couple of times. I used yahoo chat and google talk.2) It didn't capture anything when I pointed outside my apt. May be because it was cloudy outside?3) The self image was blurry. Didn't know if people on the other side had a clear picture.-H
2,Vista issues?,"Great picture BUT that's where it ends. Whenever I shut the cam off it blue screens my laptop, the audio is nonexistent. Tech friend of mine did some checking and found some vista compatibility issues. If it wasn't for that I'd actually still have it hooked up to my laptop."
2,"Ok picture, unusable sound","I agree with some of the other reviews out there - the sound is a real problem. It took me a while to figure this out, since the USB sound should be better, and so I didn't suspect the camera itself, instead blaming my connection, the cellphone interference etc. Now it makes more sense. I'm going to dump this camera and buy another one. If you're working with a USB headset or separate mic, the picture is reasonable."
3,Good camera for the price,"The camera has a fair image, but WHAT I could ask for this price.However, the integrated microphone is not good. You plug your camera and suddenly, the sound starts coming back (weird feedback) with annoyng sounds. I tried everything to fix it, but ended up bying a external microphone, which I did not want. That is why I will give 3 out 5 start to this camera."
4,Nice little webcam but bloated software,"Bought this for my wife, works fine but the software that comes with the camera is bloatware. If you try and just load drivers, the camera doesnt seem to work as well. For the price its fine, but logitech should allow a driver only install."
3,Good value for money,"I was looking for a webcam to use for chatting with my mother. I wanted an affordable, reasonably priced webcam that does it's purpose...so I bought this one.I had some minor glitches though..my computer hangs and shows black screen after using the webcam with voice while chatting. I have to remove my battery and unplug the power cord of the laptop to restart or reboot. Luckily, I'm a little bit of a techie, so I just did a little research and found a way how to fix the problem. I haven't encountered the same issue since then."
4,Good deal,"The camera is a good deal! It does its job well and it is not that expensive. If you adjust the light and sharpness, it should work fine! Unless you are looking for an amazingly perfect picture, then the quickcam is good for you! I am satisfied and recommend it."
5,great product,product was received in record time and was a great price love this cam was also very easy to install
3,Logitech 961400-0403 Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxe,I am pleased with the product. I was looking for a basic camera. The Logitech 961400-0403 Quickcam for Notebooks Deluxe meets my requirements.
2,Unable to use mic,"The video was remarkably sharp, but never could get any sound no matter what I or my computer guy tried. Returned the camera and bought a quickcam pro elsewhere that worked fine. Go figure."
3,Good picture but email conflict,"Installation went OK, but using the QuickCam software to link to mt email (Outlook) failed. I uninstalled the software and then reinstalled and got the same problem. I also think the software would be much improved if it compressed the desktop video. All in all, good camera, problematic software. I'm running Win 2000."
1,Poor Support,"I have excellent PC and Mac computer. And this is what happen.Pro:It works good on Windows XP, but only ""1 frame per second"" when using messenger.Con:It comes with CD for Mac OS X, but it doesn't support any mac.I went to logitech website for help, and still doesn't work out right.Buy as it, and that's it."
2,not so great,"I bought this cam for $43 looking at the good reviews, but completely disappointed with the quality. My brother got creative webcam pro for $15 the same time I got logitech quickcam. Both seems to have same picture quality. I feel I wasted money"
5,"WORKS GREAT, NO COMPLAINTS","The camera works great. It fits well on my HP dv5000. The supplied software is easy to use & install. I have used the webcam on Yahoo IM. Settings allow you to adjust for lighting conditions. It's pretty much fool proof, and the image is good. It comes with a travel case, which is nice."
2,Horrible picture and sound quality,"Picture and sound quality are VERY poor from this little device. It does not have a noise canceling device so quite often an echo can be heard. The video is small, grainy, and dark. Although the camera fits nicely on the top rim of my laptop screen, it is not very adjustable up or down/side to side and since the video window is so small, it often sets the subject off to one side or the other instead of centered. The only thing that I like about these 'Quickcam's' is that they are extremely easy and straightforward to use.I ended up purchasing the 'Pro' version of this camera at the same time and have been very pleased with it. I recommend to anyone considering purchasing this product to spend the extra money and get the Pro version."
3,It's a good webcam.,"I would say the image is fairly good. Also I like the functions like take pictures and take videos. However, the holder design is terrible. It has no way to put on a laptop like Dell or IBM. So I have to hold it by hand every time I use it. I hate to say it, but the designer must carzy. They seem never tried it on different laptops before they put it on market."
5,"Clear, Easy, Affordable","This product is one of the best webcam I ever used. At first, I thought webcam for laptops may not be as clear as desktop webcams, but this product proved me wrong. It's handy size allows me to bring it wherever I go. Excellent pick!"
5,Great Little Webcam for a Low Price,"I ordered two of this webcam: one for myself and the other for my spouse for an easy way to say hi when we're apart.It has been a very nice little camera - it works well in low/moderate home light, especially if you activate the ""light boost"" option. The mike is OK, but I'll likely to get a headset at some point to cut down on reverb-y sounds.The unit is very compact, clips easily to the top of my laptop and also has a handy protective carrying case. It was easy to set up, with a disc that installs the program onto the computer.[...]"
3,decent,decent picture quality. biggest issue for me is getting it to fit and sit properly on top of laptop screen. i have to place on the slider lock portion just above the screen to have it sit properly. not entirely pleased with the fit. sits loosely on top. would't buy it again for that reason.
1,very disappointed,This product does not work in any acceptable way with an Apple notebook. Had to return it. Only saw a very blurry image - not even recognizable.I had read a review saying it worked with Apple notebooks. Very disappointed.
2,Not user friendly,"The webcam was delivered with it's programing on a generic disc. (no company logo, ser. # etc...). The programing on the disc would not load properly and I was forced to go to Logitechch's website and download software that worked. When using the cam with Microsoft's Live Messenger both my system and the other ends computer crashed. This did not result in any major damage and was probably caused by the Microsoft program but I mention it because Microsoft's Live Messenger is a popular program and folks should know that Logitech's webcam software and Microsoft's Live Messenger are evidently not compatible. Overall,I'm disappointed with this product."
3,Its Ok for the price,I bought this webcam few days back from Amazon. For the price its OK but the picture quality is very bad. It's Ok for me because I hardly use the webcam. If somebody who is looking for good quality webcam then this is not the one you are looking for..
3,Works well for the most part,"The webcam works well most of the time, but during the first 10 or so uses of this camera on gmail chat, the computer went to a blue screen and restarted. I performed a system restore to the date I installed it and it seemed to dramatically lessen these occurrences. I am no computer whiz so I'm not really sure what the real probelm is. I also bought this camera for a friend so that we could chat. Unfortunately the same thing happens with his computer. He has not performed a system restore and so the blue screen continues to happen a little more frequently than I am experiencing.Otherwise this webcam works ok. I got a great price so it is worth it now, although I was worried at first."
3,"good webcam, doesnt always function","the webcam quality is pretty good, however my husband is having issues with his not working properly and the adjustable clamp doesnt quite fit over a curved surface (like my hp pavilion notebook)."
2,Compact Webcam But BIG Troubles!,"I first installed the program from the Logitech CD that came with the webcam but it gave me a lot of problems -- it slowed down my computer and gave me the blue death screen (which eventually makes it restart). I uninstalled the program and decided to just ""plug-and-play"". It works okay then. Picture quality is fine as it adjusts accordingly to light changes. However, the sound quality is TERRIBLE! There are random LOUD static noises every so often which would be my biggest complaint with this product. I tried installing drivers for the webcam but nothing seems to fix the static. I'm unhappy with the product but I'll just deal with it until I could afford to buy a better one."
4,Recommended for notebooks,"This is a great camera for the price. I use it with Skype and Google Talk, and previously have used it with MSN. I notice no difference between this camera and any others that are more expensive. It has an effective built in microphone.It nicely clips to the top of most notebook computers. If you use a docking station or don't have your laptop open, you'll need to find something else about an inch in width to clip it to. (Mine is on a picture frame next to my monitor when I use a docking station)."
1,Terrible image,"You get what you paid for!I saw all the good reviews and thought that maybe technology went down in price and can offer a good camera for that price.... not such chance. The image is terribly grainy, I can hardly recognize myself on the screen, it's that bad."
1,not recommended,it crashed my brand new sony vaio laptop twice.... i dont recommend it to anybody....
4,"GOOD, BUT..............",The camera is OK[...]I have a HP Pavilion zd7000 and the clip doesn't fit exactly in the notebook's cover. I managed to have it in the cover but it's kind of an unstable fixing.
1,Gulp! The Driver!,"Overall, this should be a wonderful piece of hardware! It has everything! It has excellent reviews.... but warning on the driver. I put it into my CD driver and it kept grinding... Mine could have been just one bad driver out of millions. I have used Logitech devices before and they have been fantastic."
4,Product is good,"Product is the same as mentioned in the website. I was really impressed with the amazon's delivery shcedules. They alwasys get my things on time or before their scheduled dates.Thanks AMAZON team.Regards,--Charul"
5,GOOD 1,SINCE I GOT THIS I HAVNT USED IT.. ITS NEVER WITH ME...ALL THE TIME MY FRIENDS R USING IT.. DONNO WITH WHOM ISIT RIGHT NOW...
4,"Easy, convenient and good","This product was value for money, very easy to install and very comfortable while using it. When I am using for chatting or showing my kid to his grandparents on video, it's very easy to handle. No long wires and making the camera stand anymore...!! It has others features of zoom in/out, face centered, etc."
3,Good design Bad quality,Well the camera is easy to install and get going but the quality is dismal at best.
4,"Great little webcam, although can be laggy.","This is a great webcam. It is easy to use and works well with Skype. Picture quality is almost flawless. Recording videos, however, it can be somewhat laggy."
4,great picture!,"Love this camera. The lighting is always perfect and it's so tiny, I can even take it in my computer bag. I'm buying them for my entire family out of the area!"
3,an ok webcam,"This webcam serves its purpose, but I was expecting more. The sound quality is very good, and the frame rate of the video is decent, but the overall video quality is disappointing; it looks very pixelated. The software is very easy to install, and the webcam couldn't be easier to operate. It's a good webcam for the price, but if you're looking for a high-quality webcam this isn't the one for you."
4,Impressed,This product is exactly what it says it is. The picture quality is pretty impressive for such a small camera. I have read many who dislike the clip but it fits fine on my Dell 1505 laptop. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Good for the money,"I was looking for an inexpensive, small webcam and found this one on Amazon. This camera is easy to install, easy to use and the picture is pretty decent. I understand the picture quality could be a little better if I spent a little more money, but with a limited budget the camera does the job. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this webcam for anyone who is budget-minded."
4,Good for videochatting on laptops,"I bought this back in the day when laptops didn't all have integrated webcams yet. This webcam is specific for notebooks due to its short cable and the way it attaches - it uses a clamp-mechanism that latches onto your laptop's lid, so if you have a laptop with a tapered lid, it may be hard to attach. Included is a little rubber extension for the clamp that makes it easier to attach to thin laptop screens.Picture quality is decent for the price and sound quality is acceptable for videochatting (played my guitar over videochat once.. apparently it came out fine on the other side)The lens does have a manual focus function (twist the ring around the opening) and tilts in a sagittal plane (assuming you're facing the camera)."
2,Caveat Emptor: Doesn't Work with Windows 7,"I bought this camera as a needed tool for an online class and had to return it. The minimum requirements do not state that it does not work with Windows 7. I could not install the drivers on my laptop, so I went to the Logitech website to try to find a driver for W7, but there is none. This camera is not supported for W7."
4,"Good quick review, but only covers about 80%","The good thing about this book is that it's very short. With only about 100 pages of content (the rest is practice tests) it is a very quick read. The downside is that it doesn't cover everything. I started studying for the this exam two days ago and I took it today. I read this book, took the practice exams and then looked at the practice exam in the official book from the college board and realized that a lot of it wasn't covered here. So I went to instantcert.com and went through about half of their flash cards and scored a 72 (out of 80) on the test today."
4,Great study guide,"Well written and informative. I studied for about a month, a little bit each day, and scored a 69 (heh, heh) in September of 06. I used only this guide, although I did look up Maslow's hierarchy of needs which wasn't included and was referenced on the test. I would definitely recommend this guide. I hope their Biology guide is as comprehensive because that's next.Pete"
3,Not what I expected,"This book provided only a minimal amount of information about midi programming and failed to explain most midi terms and how they define how midi works in a systematic way, e.g., it doesn't explain how system and control change fit into programming what you might want to do with midi. In other words, it did not focus on midi routing that much in any detailed or easy-to-understand way. I was hoping to see something like a tree diagram, instead, the author went on to describe things like envelope shaping, digital audio and effects processing.On the whole this book would probably be too rudimentary for anyone who already owns a synthesizer or music software, as these modern day products help you to tweak sounds through user friendly programming within each device. However, I did pick up a few tips."
3,No buffoonery here...,"but not a first rate session, either. Neither Dickenson nor trumpeter Joe Thomas fare well with pianist Tommy Flanagan, who was too modern for their swing era styles. In fact the Prestige label ruined several dates around the same time as this one by foisting bop pianists on swing musicians. Everybody tries hard on this one, but the results are just so-so."
1,Factory Rejects,"The People at BP Medical fail to mention that %MOST% of their products are either overstocks or factory rejects from Ever Dixie EMS Supply. Their bags fall apart, have bad seams, etc. Then, when mentioned the bags are falling apart, they promise a replacement and you never hear from them again."
2,Nice bag,"Nice bag, but the picture makes it seem like supplies come with - they do not. Also it is very hard to get blood stains off this bag, which seems a little silly."
4,Love this Oven!,"We have this oven at my job and it's wounderful. On convection bake you can do a frozen pizza in 5 minutes and frozen tilapia in 10 minutes. I've been shopping around for this oven looking for competitive pricing because honestly, its expensive. I like that the oven door isn't cheap feeling, so u can slam it and it still closes softly. The digital features are accurate and buttons are sturdy and easy to be cleaned. Only downside is that the exterior gets extremely hot, yeah hotter than a regular oven."
5,I LOVE THIS OVEN,"This is a great combination toaster/convection oven. I have baked pies, brownies, bisquits and pizza. I plan to bake some cookies next. The heat is very even because everything come out perfect. I read all the reviews and also the price was very reasonable compared to other ovens I was looking at. I would highly recommend this, it is nice looking, the fan is really quiet and love the stainless steel too. I received it at my door in just 2 days, so I am really pleased. Thanks Amazon."
2,non-stick coating,When I bought this oven I didn't know it had a non-stick coating. Most have listed it in the product features so I returned it. I didn't want the toxic fumes that non-stick coatings emit.
2,Not as good as the older model.,"We recently replaced our old Cuisinart oven with this model. The older model browned the toast to various degrees via the selector. With this model, it is not properly browned at setting 4 and burnt at setting 5. The bottom of the baked items burns even at lower oven temperatures and shorter baking times. Have adjusted the rack settings with only minor success. Should have kept the old one."
4,Cuisinart TOB-195,"Very happy with the Cuisinart toaster ovens with convection feature. After our first purchase of the older model >10 years ago, we bought one for each of our children. They are very happy with theirs, use it almost daily for a variety of toasting/baking. We replaced ours with this model for the larger capacity and due to uneven toasting/baking of the former (one corner browns too dark now ? age). The couple of improvements I feel should be considered for later models are 1- a small oven light and 2- the tray slides out when the door is opened by a hinged connection. I would give this product 4-1/2 stars out of 5 for reliability, ease of use, small footprint on counter space and a capacity that allows for roasting a 4 lb chicken. And btw, saves on electricity since one does not need to heat up a regular oven and value."
5,"Save energy, keep the heat down","We really enjoy our toaster oven, while we use it for different functions, it really is great as a small oven. Two factors which are attractive, use less energy than starting and using the big stove oven, and keeps the heat down in the kitchen in these days of hot weather.its a great purchase and we enjoy it."
4,Great but not Perfect!,"Awesome Toaster Oven...we use it all the time!!! Would definitely purchase again!PROS:Very easy to useLarge inside so can toast several slices/wafflesOutside isn't massively HOTHeats up super fast!CONS:Agree with everyone about the crumb tray...not user friendlyDoes not toast as evenly as reviews state...little disappointedTimer will go off and NOT STOP beeping unless you turn it off, very annoying.Overall great product and will pay for itself, as I don't used the oven as much!"
4,Great Product! Great shipping (from Amazon).,"Love the product; easy cleaning (important for me). Takes a little bit of learning the first few uses, but simple in logic. Only drawback is that a second wire shelf would be great because with convection you could put in two pizzas. Am glad I read review in Consumer Report. Strongly recommend it."
5,The Caddy of Toaster Ovens,I've had this oven for a couple of months and couldn't be more pleased. I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different ovens and was sure I would have suffered a burn or two by now...I'm happy to report no burns and everything has cooked fine. The digital controls and stainless look set this unit apart.It does take up some counter space but we have plenty to spare.In addition it does give off some heat so when in use I pull it away from the cabinets above.
5,An awesome replacement,"Bought this to replace a smaller model with a timer dial that was not functioning properly after many years of service. Love the fact that it is digital.Cooks and toasts very well. I use it often for cooking smaller meals, and it is huge which is very nice when you don;t feel like heating your whole house with your big oven."
4,"High end toaster oven, but...","This toaster oven is certainly at the top end of the food chain - lots of features, bells, and whistles. I would have given it 5 stars, but on occasion the heating is uneven, resulting in part of the food getting unintentionally blackened. A little bit of adjustment (lower temperature, shorter cooking time, more monitoring) usually solves the problem.At this price point, I would expect a device that is largely effortless; that is not quite the case here."
3,"A question about the toaster oven on a counter with only 30"" to the top cabinet","We just bought this oven and we very excited about it. When we opened the instruction manual, it says we should not put in on a counter where there is a cabinet above (I guess for safety). That was disappointing as we have no counter space that does not have a cabinet above.Anyone had experience with their oven on a counter with a cabinet above? If so,how many inches?Thanks, disappointed"
2,limited lifetime; no repairs,"I purchased my Cuisinart TOB-195 toaster oven 28 November 2008. I use it to cook a frozen pizza once a week, and also to toast my English muffin each morning. So not exactly heavy use.It quit working this week. One morning the controls simply no longer function and the display is dead.I took it to an authorized Cuisinart dealer, only to discover that Cuisinart does not provide parts. This toaster oven cannot be repaired. I called Cuisinart customer service and they confirmed this.For a top-of-the-line product, given how little I used it and how much I paid for it, I expected this toaster oven to last more than 4 years."
2,Dissatisfied with quality,The first one I purchased had about an eighth inch gap on the right side when the glass door was shut. I contacted Cuisinart and they said it was still under warranty but I would have to pay for shipping and handling to get a replacement. I contacted Amazon and they replaced it for free. This one STILL has a gap on the right hand side of the door but it is about a sixteenth inch. I am not a professional cook but I think this has to cause uneven cooking and heat loss. This is the second oven I have purchased from Cuisinart; the first one had exactly the same functions but was a little smaller and the door closed fully.I won't buy another product from them but I will always make my purchases from Amazon. I have dealt with them for many years and can't praise them enough.Jerry C.
4,Great little oven,"After dealing with a Krups convection toaster oven that had great reviews but couldn't make toast to save its life, I finally decided to switch to the Cuisinart. It had all of the features I was looking for, except for the interior light. Well, I LOVE this oven. I would have given it five stars if it had the light and the crumb tray could be removed from the front. Other than that, it's perfect. It looks great, is very easy to use, and makes great toast with very little effort. I've used the convection bake for cookies, muffins, corn casserole--perfect every time. I reduce the temp by 25 degrees and decrease cooking time a bit. I also regularly heat chicken nuggets--it's very quick and preheats quickly. The included pan really maximizes the interior space but my 9x9 and deep dish stoneware bakers fit perfectly. I highly recommend this oven! Also, I don't find that the exterior is very hot at all during baking--I'm not sure why other reviewers had a problem with this."
4,"Very good overall, but could be little better.","I replaced my old Black & Decker toaster oven with this Cuisinart. Overall I am very pleased with the performance and I even purchased another one for my mother. If I could change one thing to make this the perfect 5 star oven, I would increase the power output to something like 1800 watts or simply add one more top-center heating element for better broiling results. I like to broil my filet steaks and lamb chops and they come out okay in this unit. However, my Black & Decker oven produced slightly better steaks/chops that were browned better."
2,Good while it lasts.,"We have had two of these. The door has broken on both of them. The spring-loaded arm becomes out of alignment and the door won't close. I was able to fix it by bending the arm assembly for a while, but now it is shot. It also gets extremely hot to touch and the rack/tray does not extend out when the door is opened. You have to use a mitt or pot holder and the tray is awkward to remove as a result. It functioned well when it was working, but the door is cheaply attached and prone to failure. Time to try something else, but the reviews of all the products keep me guessing if any company produces anything of quality anymore!"
3,Not a good toaster.,"We have been using a Panasonic toaster oven for the past 13 years, so my comments are in comparison to the Panasonic. The TOB-195 takes much longer to warm up to toast bread and it does not have a light to show what is happening inside of the oven. The grided shelf that holds the bread is constructed upside down. This makes it is impossible to just slide the toast off of the grid, because the toast catches on the shelf support. If the wire grid was reversed toast would just slide right off onto your plate, now I have to use a fork to unload toast. Overall this is a very good product, but with some changes could be made better."
3,Space hog and powerful,"I used to have a 20 year old workhorse GE toaster oven. Fast and reliable. It finally died and I thought I would trade up to a convection oven to use instead of heating up my big oven. It certainly has the power of a real oven, but really is too small for most things I do for a family of 6.As I have only had it for a month or so, I can't attest to the longevity of the Cuisinart, but I think: it takes up a huge amount of counter space, it is overkill (and slow) when toasting a slice or 2, there are too many buttons/options (3 pages of the manual to explain ""Toast""). I also think I will need to buy a regular toaster for basic toasting (would rather push 1 button than 3). I also agree that there is a design flaw as it is really easy to burn your hand on the door when opening.I gave it 3 stars because of these issues but it seems well made."
1,Had to return it,"Unit emits an annoying humming/buzz sound continuously. This could be a serious electrical problem since only the clock LCD that is running. I wonder how many units out there sitting on kitchen counters with the same problem unnoticed.Quisinart would replace it but I have to pay for one-way shipping. This is legal because it is written in the warranty disclosure, but unethical for certain. They want the consumer to subsidize their manufacturing sloppiness. This is a mark of a bad company. Where is integrity?"
4,dead after 2.5 years - but replaced by the company,"Something in the power supply or the controls burned out, and the toaster stopped recognizing that it was plugged in. We think it also fried a couple of our power outlets. Cuisinart mailed us a replacement and let us ship back the broken one in their box. That's a pretty decent outcome, all things considered."
4,"Consistent results, horrible interface","Many people will buy a standalone toaster if they are looking to get consistent results with their toast/bread. Toaster ovens generally don't do a great job with that. I needed a toaster oven and didn't want to have a separate standalone toaster as well and this thing does the job. Great consistent toast every time! And of course with the oven and convection oven capabilities, along with the large interior, it can handle many jobs that our oven used to do.The downside to this toaster is that the interface is quite possibly the worst controls/interface to ANYTHING that I have ever used."
5,The Little Oven that Could...,"After reading the reviews I purchased this oven when my kitchen was being renovated and I needed a way to cook food. I LOVE this appliance and now, even though I once again have use of my regular-sized kitchen oven, I find that I use this oven every day not only for toasting bread, bagels and sandwiches, but for baking and roasting and broiling. The interior is large enough to accommodate my biggest casserole and the convection feature makes cooking main dishes faster. I highly recommend this appliance."
4,Great machine! Worth the $$$,"This Cuisinart is easy to use and works great for a variety of things. So far, we have used it to bake, broil, convection and of course toast. It also looks great with all the other stainless steel appliances in our kitchen. Look no further and buy it!"
1,Cuisinart Toaster/Convection Oven Not As Advertised,"We already had this oven in white enamel, 4-5 years old, so I ordered the wife one this Christmas to go with the stainless steel appliances in our newly renovated kitchen. I was tremendously disappointed when she opened it on Christmas morning to find that the only stainless steel on the entire oven was a 1-inch cowling around the door, and a small brand logo on the door itself. The remainder of the oven, front control panel, sides, back, top, was enameled steel. I am sending this item back to Amazon as soon as I get permission, and searching for another brand that is truthful as to its construction."
1,Too much,"This oven was too big, with too many features, and way too many controls for what we wanted. We returned it for a simpler version at less than half the cost and are very pleased with results. More is not more. You do not have to have a convection oven to get good toast."
1,Burned itself out in 2 weeks!,I thought I had finally found the replacement to my 12 year old toaster oven. HA! It had the outlet chirp - so we replaced the outlet. It did it again! So we moved the toaster to another counter and it killed itself. Amazon was super easy to work with on the return. Still haven't found a replacement.
3,Cuisinart Toaster Oven with Convection,"This purchase was made to replace an older version of the same Cuisinart toaster/convection oven, because we experienced a lightning strike to our house. The new version is larger and sleeker with the stainless steel, but you must be careful when opening it.....because the new position of the elevated handle can burn you when opening a hot unit. Just be careful. I'm wondering if they might actually have a recall on them at some point. Other than that, it works just as well as my previous model. I have many Cuisinart products in my kitchen."
4,great extra oven and efficient toaster,"We ordered this new cuisinart oven to replace a well used one, which we took to our condo in florida. The baking and broiling features are excellent, and capacity is greater than our original oven. My only complaint is that the crumb tray still has to be removed from the back. This necessitates sliding the oven around on the counter. OK on my granite, but awkward. Some models we looked at had front removal tray. Also, every brand, no matter the price, has poor insulation."
2,Hot and can burn you,"The oven works ok, but it does not have a removable crumb tray. Very difficult to clean. I would consider it a design fault.The outside of the over gets very hot. Hot enough to burn! I certainly wouldn't let me 8 year old use it. I would opt for another oven if I was looking to buy this one."
5,replacing an older model Cuisinart,Stainless steel is the way to go - easy clean up. The new oven is larger than my older one - but the controls are the same and temp settings work better.
3,be careful with that glass,"I have had this toaster oven for a few years now. I liked it so well that I gave another as a gift. Sadly, just a little bump of a dish along the edge of the open glass door had it shattering and Cuisinart doesn't sell parts. It's rather expensive to order such a little custom thing through a glass shop, but it's either that or pitch the whole thing. Anyway, disappointing."
2,It was good while it lasted,"We had this for about 3 years. We bought it at Costco when we started our membership there. I was in love with the looks and the digital controls. The toast over prior to it was an old hand-me-down. I noticed early on that the toaster tray is not easy to remove or put back, and you can't cover it with foil very easily. A few weeks ago it started cooking really, really hot - much hotter than the temperature for which it was set. It would smoke and set off the fire alarm. A few days ago it stopped working. When you pressed Start, it would show 3 dashes and that was it. After several separate attempts, it would decide to work once, and then it would go back to the dashes the next time we tried it. We typically use it 1-2 times a day. So now we have to replace it - we won't be getting the same model."
5,Cuisinart Toaster Oven TOB-195,"I have only used it for two weeks. It feels like a substantial product. Pros: Solid construction, good heat control, easy to use, convection heating is a good capabilityCons: poorly insulated and it gives off too much heat and the outside gets very hot (not good in hot weather). Also, don't ever leave anything on top of or near to the unit when it is heating due to the poor insulation. But so far so good."
3,"Not bad, but a bit overpriced","I purchased this toaster oven after leaving my old cheap ""big box store"" toaster oven behind in a move. Overall, it's decent, but not worth the money. My old toaster oven was less than half the price, and worked much better.This is a decent little oven replacement. It heats up quickly and the convection function is quiet. It doesn't take extra time to cook anything, and it's good as an energy-saver. However, it doesn't cook entirely evenly, even using convection bake. The back cooks/toasts faster than the front, and the top cooks/toasts faster than the bottom. I was also disappointed to discover there is no way to adjust the height of the oven rack. And, the last disappointment is that the oven doesn't turn off when the timer goes off, except on the toast setting.I don't regret buying this toaster oven. But, I wouldn't recommend this over a cheaper option for any reason except that it is very attractive on my countertop."
4,cuisinart tob-195,love it. Just wish that the emptying tray was not in the back. Makes it inconvenient to clean.Great toaster oven!
5,Extreemly Happy,"After doing research, I settled on the TOB-195. It was also rated as one of the best on Consumer Reports website (Dec 2008). When it arrived, it lived up to my expectations. It does seem to be good quality and looks like a high end stainless appliance. I had a relative come over and ask if I spent more on it than I did my regualar oven! We have had the Cuisinart for a month now and in that time I do not think we fired up our regular oven once. Our favorite feature is how quickly it pre-heats. It will pre-heat to 350 degrees in around two to three minutes! We routinely prepare tacos, pizzas, cookies, toast/breakfast sandwitches and it lives up to our expectations. Other reviewers mentioned getting burned on the door. I have found the glass door to get very hot but so far have managed to keep my hands on the handle so it has not been a problem. If you are shopping around for a toaster overn, your search is over. You can't go wrong with this Cuisinart."
4,Great toaster oven,This is a very nice toaster oven. Heats up quickly. It could use a internal light and it would be nice if Cuisinart made a cookie sheet that was 12 x 12. The after market cookie sheets that I have found are very small.
4,Like it alot,"I am generally pleased with this toaster oven. My family and I use it almost daily for toasting and it works great. However, I have had a few poor experiences baking with it...it is fine for baking small items like pizza puffs but not so good for things like muffins or quick breads."
2,Toaster Oven,"Cuisianrt TOB 195 Toaster OvenWe bought this oven primarily for making toast. It does not work at all if you follow the directions given. They indicate you need to place the toast on the rack at the top of the oven. This does not work!! Instead we place the toast in the middle rack and put the indicator of darkness of toast at its highest level - turn the toaster on and let it run for the full 5:03 minutes and then set it to run again. At about a total of 7:30 minutes we have great toast. We tried to broil chicken and were completely dissatisfied. So, we like the toast better than using a large conventional oven, but certainly don't feel it is worth the price paid for what we have found uses for so far. J. F. Poynor Granbury, TX"
4,Cuisinart Toaster Oven,"This is a very nice oven. The only problem is that the back half of food, such as pizza, seems to get over done. Also, you have to be careful when opening the door because the metal strip at the top of the glass gets very hot. I just got a nice burn on the top of my finger. Other wise it does a good job and is easy to use."
4,Cuisinart Toaster Oven Works Great,"I am not much of a cook. Most of my cooking is very basic.I have been using the the Cuisinart Convection Toaster Oven for about two months and it works great.I use it to make pizza with Boboli's Pizza Crust, and the pizzas taste great.I wish it had an internal light so that I can see if the food cooking properly."
2,Waste of money,"I really thought I would be getting something special. This oven is too small for the standard 9 x 13 baking dish, one shelf (all that comes with it) is not enough because of the drip pan needing to be in the oven when used. Something this expensive should have more design for ease of cleaning. The standard $69 job would do just as well."
3,cuisinart TOB-195 exact heat toaster oven broiler stainless,"The size of the oven was a little smaller than I anticipated, and food baked in the oven tend to be very dry, As mentioned by previous reviewers, the door and handle can get very hot. However, the oven is easy to clean and it is great to have the temperature control and timer. The desired temperatures are attained very quickly. Overall, I am pleased with the product."
1,Why didn't any review say the entire outside of the oven gets extremely HOT!,We just bought the Cuisinart tob 195 because of all the positive ratings and reviews read about here and everywhere else. Why did NO ONE say that the entire outside of the unit (except the door and handle) gets EXTREMELY HOT? You could get a bad burn if you touch the top or sides when it's in operation. You can't keep anything in a plastic bag (bread?) on top of the unit. I am very displeased with my purchase! mary tomaselli
3,TOASTER OVEN,"Large and Bulky, not attractive at all.Works quite well but it's styling is straight from the 50's"
3,Cuisinart Exact Heat Toaster Oven Broiler,The toasting element is excellent. I am not as happy with the Oven and broiler as I don't think it cooks as evenly as my large wall unit so only use it for toast.
3,Cook real well but it dated,Having to turn around the toaster-over to clean the tray (whish you can only pull-it out from the back). Also miss not having the keys lighted - difficult to see what you are doing. It cooks real well but I wish I had selected a different-one.
4,Daughter still likes it a year later,"I bought for daughter as a gift and have only used it once. So the review reflects her experience.She said ""Everything on it works. I'd give it 4-5 stars. The only issue is that the outside gets a little warm, but that is a known issue. ""I did a lot of research to find a good multiuse machine and this one was best I found. Actually, I can't wait for our old toaster oven to die so we can have one of these. My other daughter had one of these and they really can do a variety of jobs for modern cook.I'd buy it again! But for me next time"
5,A great toaster oven that actually toasts!,"I read lots of reviews before purchasing this oven. I've owned other units that never really toasted bread and took forever to broil/bake. I hesitated over the price but I very satisfied with this unit. You get what you pay for! I have used the toasting unit almost daily - the ""toast/bagel"" option is great for the relatively thick sprouted grain English muffins we frequently have for breakfast. I've also baked muffins and a small chicken and broiled fish fillets with excellent results. The only drawbacks to the unit have been mentioned previously - the toast crumb tray is accessed from the back and the cord is shorter than others I've owned (I actually had to unplug it in order to get the cord out of the way so I could access the crumb tray). But this is a small complaint given that it isn't something needing to be done daily. The Cuisinart delivers on the things that one wants a toaster oven for and I'm very pleased."
3,Mixed Opinion,"I have Had a version of this oven for several years. I bought the Cuisinart because I hoped it's high price would mean high quality.First, my complaints: A toaster it is not! It takes more than 5 minutes to brown one side of the bread - the other side is still unbrowned.The door catches crumbs which I can't reach. The internal digital timer will not turn the oven off except when toasting.The crumb tray removes from the rear and makes a mess when you remove it. It is difficult to keep clean.Now the good stuff . It has not failed in over 5 years of use. It does bake well with the digital temp control. It uses minimal counter space.The convection function does speed up some things well - baking potatoes for instance. It does not bake cookies or multiple items evenly."
5,FANTASTIC !,"This is my third such purchase of a counter-top oven/convention oven unit. None of them even come close to this one. It is easy to use, but has all the features I wanted including temperature setting and timer. It heats up very fast and does a wonderful job on baking casseroles, pizzas, vegetable dishes and even toast. I would highly recommend it!!"
4,Second time around,This is the second Cuisinart toaster oven that I have owned. I had the first one for 6 years and it was still working fine but the paint was beginning to peel from the heat so we got a new stainless model. This new one is a little larger than the old one which is nice. In my view its a quality product and seems to hold temperature levels pretty well. I use it not only to make toast but as a substitute for my full size oven.
5,Great Appliance Does it All,"This appliance does it all. Great for defrosting and toasting bagels. You hit toaster button and then immediately hit defrost button, so it is a single operation. Wonderful convection oven. Looks smart and works very well. This is the perfect toaster oven/convection oven/ broiler for two people. I don't have to heat up the regular oven, so it saves energy. The convection feature saves time. Highly recommended.Cuisinart TOB-175BC Convection Toaster Oven/Broiler, Brushed Chrome"
4,Good little oven,"After searching a lot of places and reading reviews I decided on this one. The size is good especially for pizza. I like the size because it is taller instead of wider like some ovens since the controls are on the bottom instead of the side. It seems to toast well and cooks well. The only thing I wish it had was an interior light. It is pretty dark inside. The outside can get a little hot but not enough to damage the wall that it is next to on the counter. The handle stays pretty cool on the door but I still use a mit at all times. The construction feels tough and durable, not flimsy like the cheaper models. I have had this for a few months now and it is working great!"
2,Where is the Stainless Steel?,"I chose this and paid a premium thinking it was made of stainless steel, as described. I have a stainless electric coffee pot which is made completely out of stainless steel. This appliance has stainless colored plastic handles and control panel. Painted silver color metal body. Only the handle, the trim around the door, and control panel trim is stainless. Even the support pieces for the door handle are plastic.I feel this appliance is misrepresented and am returning it."
4,"Good size oven, good toaster too",I bought this product because the good reviews on Amazon. I am happy about it so far. It is a sqaure so it is suitable to bake pizza. The food comes close to the heating element so it is good for boiling. I use it a lot as a toaster also.There are some concerns from other peoples's reviews. It is true that it makes a humming noise. I think the handle was properly located. Burning your hands should not be a concern. Teh control buttons are somewhat complicated so read the manual first.
5,Great Toaster Oven,"Cuisinart TOB-195 Exact Heat Toaster Oven Broiler, StainlessThe day I received this I cooked Mac & Cheese in it, came out great. It is very easy to use, toast comes out toasted, with easy to use time control. Have recommended this to a relative looking for a new toaster oven. The caution about the door being hot while baking is correct, and care is needed to grab the handle without extending your fingers to touch the door. However, one time of touching it is enough to make you remember how to open the door. I expect to be happily using this oven for many years to come."
3,Woolrich noir in Havana...,"The Black Path of Fear is formulaic (read: okay, but not a classic) Woolrich crime novel. As usual we have a lead character under duress, with Woolrich turning up the heat. Predictable? Yes, generally. However Woolrich treats us with a rather surprising ending.The story is simple. A down-and-out guy gets a job as a gardener for a rich Miami gangster (timeframe: circa 1940). He gets into a brief relationship with the gangster's wife, and both escape to Havana. Naturally things go badly, and our leading man finds himself running through the seedy parts of Havana to escape capture from the police. His saviour is a most unusual Cuban woman (a compassionate criminal with extreme hatred of the police). Along the way we are treated with encounters by masochistic thugs, drug smugglers and opium addicts.Bottom line: an enjoyable, escapist read. Worth a look."
2,An overly scholastic look at an interesting document,The concept of this book was admirable and the text of the encyclical is intriguing but a lot of the narrative is dull and repetitive. Its a good piece of information that could have been presented in a more readable manner.
2,Not that great,For the price the cuality of this product is not that great Ithink this product is expensive the materials in it they look very cheap.
5,Nice selection of Disco Hits at bargain Price,"This cd contains some great Disco Hits, some of which are in their fully extended form (and some are extended, but shortened slightly). Songs such as ""Born to be Alive"", ""In the Bush"", ""Hot Shot"", ""This Time Baby"", ""Don't Leave Me This Way"" and ""Rock Your Baby"" were massive. I went to lots of discos in the 70's and the clubs were all playing these songs. This cd brings back all those good memories! Highly recommended!"
3,"A good manner to remind those funny ""Saturday-Night-Disco-Dancing"" years...","This CD includes a very nice extended version of John McRae's ""Rock Your Baby"", as well as ""Hot Shot"" by Karen Young among other great Disco dancing tunes. Sound quality is adequate if you're planning to use it in your next ""Disco-Retro"" party!But... Why these freaks of Rebound Records had to include in this CD ""Swearin' To God"" by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, and also ""Planet Rock"" by Afrika Bambaataa & The Soul Sonic Force? These were really insignificant Disco hits... I would have given an extra Star if other songs were in the list of real Disco Hits instead..."
3,good times,"ok true i was born in 1981 after all these songs were made but, i love this cd and most of the songs are as popular as they were 30 years ago. My favorites would have to be You make Me Feel and don't leave me this way."
1,Do not purchase!,"Do not waste your money on this product. This is probably the worst product I've ever purchased through amazon and its associated merchants. The workmanship is really crappy. Plastic handle. Plastic eyelets. Poorly glued. I used this pole on a trip to the bahamas recently. With the first strike, the pole itself cracked where the thickest part of the rod meets the handle. I managed to land the less than 1 lb reef fish, but the pole was rendered useless. Then upon collapsing the pole, the eyelets came unglued. What crap! This is worthy of zero stars! There are much better options for your money."
3,Best Cd Ever!,This CD is by far the best 20 bucks I ever spent. If they made a CD better than this I would have to roll over and die in respect for the producers of this magically fantastic CD.
4,A thrify Shopper,"I brought this product for myself being 40 and thifty, I figured it would serve it's purpose. I found this product to be very good. The play quality is great. My only complaint is that I could only fit 26 songs on it. With that being said, I would recommend this product. It serves it's purpose, and you can't beat the price!!!"
2,cake image,"I ordered this image for my son's first birthday and when I got it, it was already cracked. I made the best of it though because I received it too close to his birthday to attempt to return it. I will make future purchases of this type from local distributers so that I can see the product before I spend the money."
1,This does NOT get to the point.,"The original vinyl ""Getting to the Point"" has, on the second side, the ""Savoy Brown Boogie."" That's a _classic_, and not, alas, available here. Blast, hell and damnation."
5,ROAN EDITION!!!!!,Very good Bobby Breen film titled Way Down South put out on Roan DVD. The Roan edition is the best out there on DVD. It's a pretty good print with only one bad splice. Titles are intact.
4,"OMG, my eyes!","Timelash, the story fans love to hate. The DVD still gets a decent rating because you know its bad like a Plan 9 from Outer Space, but what one is really rating on these releases is the quality of the presentation.The extras on the disc are thin, but I can see why 2 | Entertain wouldn't want to spend extra cash to do some CGI effects for the story. It would have ruined it!The main meat of the extras is the documentary ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" about the making and reaction to Timelash. It quite interesting as a bashing of JNT. I like the bit where it was deduced that it had to have been JNT who added the references to the 3rd Doctor because no one else is going to fess up to it."
3,The Whole Package is Average,"Longtime Doctor Who fans rate this story in the bottom ten but I would put it a bit higher than that. The story has some flaws and continuity issues but I always liked the concept. I also thought it was fun to see H.G. Wells travel along with the Doctor for a story. But the overall DVD is just average. The story is average and the extras are average.There is a documentary about the making of the story featuring interviews with Colin Baker, Nicola Bryant, Paul Darrow, and Eric Saward. And all four of them share bad memories about working with a bad script...as if we need to be reminded. There are photos from the production but there is nothing else very extraordinary. There are no extended scenes, no deleted scenes, and no CGI options. It is just average overall but fans will want to have it in your collection."
2,About as good as 6th Doctor gets,"There were only two 6th Doctor (Colin Baker) episodes I thought were worth the paper the scripts were written on and this was one of them. Now I'm not saying this was a classic episode. But it was one of the best acted episodes of the Colin Baker period, the special effects were decent for the period and the monster/villain was well-realized. For those who are selective in their purchases of Dr. Who videos, this is one worth the money. The only other Colin Baker episode worth the money for selective buyers is Vengeance on Varos. The others are for hard core fans to complete their libraries!"
3,Don't know what the big deal is.,"I have no idea why this band is called a punk band. The music sounds like your standard bar rock. I guess because they dressed in drag and were part of the whole '70's NY punk/drug/art scene with the Ramones and Lou Reed and such. I had read and heard a lot about this band so I decided to take a chance. Was really disappointed in the music. I don't know if it is the production or what. I dunno, maybe they were way better live. Sold it not soon after I bought it. This definitely wouldn't appeal to anyone under 30 and interested in punk."
4,Seminal New York Rock,"This is one of the great pre-punk Albums, along with MC5, the Velvets and the Stooges albums. Great hooks and riffs, raw energy, short, sweet and unpretentious songs, this album is a great listen for start to finish. When listening to this album and keeping in mind when it came out, it becomes obvious how influential this group was to later hard rock and glam metal bands."
2,Not that great,"Mick Jagger said of the New York Dolls: ""Ugh, the New York Dolls! What Rubbish!"" Listen to this album, and, except for a rare good spot here and there, you'll agree with Mick."
1,Famous for their Image,"The NY Dolls, like most punk and glam from this period of the seventies - Lou Reed anyone? - had their moment in time because they were embraced by a culture that thought that these bandes were cool.This culture also thought that it was cooler than YOU were.CBGBs was their thing!Anyway, decades later and crap like this is the darling of music critics, who themselves were never cool.Well, what about the MUSIC?The music on this disc is aweful.Amateur crap, relying on image and attitude.If you buy it, you will not listen to it more than once or twice."
1,Time makes no difference,"I saw the NY Dolls at Mercer Art Center back in their first year. Frankly, they were amateurish at best; simply awful on a bad night. And time has changed nothing. This record is tedious bordering on unlistenable noise. What time HAS changed is the reverence and ""importance"" people have attached ot them. In reality they were and are at most a footnote on the glam and pre-punk scene. WIth other bands like the Miamis, they tried to be something that they simply wer enever competent or creative enough to be. So despite all the posturing and pontificating about their alleged importance, instead, I suggest you listen to anyone of the clips provided and see for yourself that this is a record not worth buying."
1,Run-of-the mill pop-punk,"One word can summarize this album: Yawn! It's boring, predictable and generic. They all had to rely on dressing like transvestites for this album to sell and failed epically. Check out Green Day for real punk."
4,Killer Androgeny!,"I don't care whether you call it punk or glam or just plain old rock n' roll, New York Dolls's self titled album is thoroughly fun and enjoyable! From punk rockers like ""Personality Crisis,"" to hard rock like ""Frankenstein,"" to the oldies vibe on ""Lonely Planet Boy,"" this is just a great album chock full of non-stop rock n' roll."
5,Pure rock n roll energy,"one thing's for sure. if i decide to start my recording career, I will never get that Todd Rundgren to produce my album. sometimes you can barely hear david johansen's voice. its not enough to kill the album though. check ""Jet Boy"". One of the most exiting, powerful, intense rock and roll songs ive heard in my life. even though the pistols wrote ""New York"" you can hear johnny thunders influence on steve jones all the time on ""Nevermind the bollocks here's the sex pistols"". i bet guns 'n roses liked the dolls too."
5,Excellent essays!,"This book is superb. Imagine women sharing their experience, strength and hope around such an intimate subject matter. Each essay is so very personal yet I identified with something in each one. Thank you to each of you who contributed."
2,not interesting,"I have read other books by the same author and found them moving and meaningful. perhaps it's just me, but this book left me blah!"
1,do not trust this author,"After reading Yitta Halberstam's HORRIBLY misguided article in the Jewish Press, I would never read or trust anything that she writes. She has shown herself to be superficial, and a terrible judge of contemporary Jewish issues.[...]"
1,great music ruined by talking,"The soundtrack has great songs, but it is ruinned by Ron Burgundy talking up and into all the songs. Get the list of songs and download them."
5,Hidden treat,"I bought this hoping for an extra joke or two on the soundtrack but then it turns out its a whole comedy album with all new material not in the movie. And its vintage Ferrell, hilarious and bizarre. I can't believe they're not advertising this more."
1,I've heard enough of Will Ferrell...,"I loved anchorman when it came out; it was hilarious. Talladega nights was almost as funny, but he's just gotten unfunny because he does the same thing all the time. Yell stupidity.I bought this because it has a good collection of songs and that was all. it's a soundtrack.what the product description doesn't tell you is that Will Ferrell babbles at the beginning of every track. Now I have to go edit each of the sound files to delete his useless, unfunny commentary at the beginning of the songs I wanted to hear.I just wanted to warn people so they don't make the mistake I did."
3,I thought it would be good,"It was disappointing to find out that ""Ron Burgundy"" talks on the first and last song. Even worse was that he has at least a 30 second introduction for each song and even talks through the whole of ""Shannon"". A plus was when Ron and his crew sing ""Afternoon Delight"" and do a good job.This compilation of songs is fantastic, but the talking truly compromises the quality of the cd. My suggestion is if you like the music on this soundtrack, you should probably find it somewhere else. In other words, don't get this soundtrack unless you think you can handle it."
3,FBI Anti-Piracy warning,Great CD if you dont use a computer to play your music (like 99% of us do). It crashed iTunes and Win XP. I had to go back to a 10 year old laptop to play it. So bewarned - this may not work on your computer.
3,"Ok, if you like commentary before each & EVERY song","Don't get me wrong, Anchorman is perhaps the funniest GD movie I've seen in a long time, and I was so looking forward to getting this soundtrack, as the songs are great; however, to my disappointment, Will Ferrel (as Ron Burgundy)either introduces the songs with some hilarious anecdote, or chooses to talk through them -- it's quite irritating especially since I was expecting to hear the songs in their entirety with Anchorman clips sprinkled throughout as tracks of their own.I plan on keeping the cd, I was just let down. :("
1,The perfect way to ruin 12 good songs,"The movie, awful, the soundtrack GREAT! The CD awful. Will Ferrel has intros for all the songs and sometimes talks into the song. On one song he talks and cries all the way through. The music is fantastic. I went out and bought it as soon as I saw the movie and nowwhere on the cover does it say that there are intros or him talking except if you read the song list you will see that there are two clips, #1 and #15 that are obviously him talking in ""Ron Burgundy's"" voice. If yo like that sort of thing you'll love it. If you are like me and wanted it for the music, don't bother. Wait for another version or buy the cds individually."
3,"Ron/Will, shut up!","Like many other reviewers, I'd seen the movie and liked it. When I checked out the tracklist for the soundtrack, it looked like a winner. And a winner it would've been except for the chatter intro'ing and THROUGH some songs.It's not that the intros/chatter aren't funny, because they are. It's just that if you're ready to hear, for example, Ride Captain Ride or Shannon in their entirety, look elsewhere. Then again, the a capella version of Afternoon Delight is practically worth the price of the CD, although it seemed to sound better in the movie.The soundtrack evokes both the movie and perhaps an era. Stay classy out there, everyone ;-)"
2,Great Music but tell Ron Burgundy to put a sock in it,"I saw this movie today (Sunday of opening weekend) and it was hilarious and the music was great which is reflected in the soundtrack. But, does Will Farrell really have to do a Ron Burgundy intro to each song? I want to hear the music not the movie character yammering on. Also, would have liked the real version of ""Skyrockets ..."" instead of the movie version. I just bought the soundtrack and am thinking of sending it out top pasture already."
1,What were they thinking?!,"After seeing the movie, I was really excited about getting what I thought would be a cool soundtrack CD. Well, the songs on the CD were what I believed they would be, a great compilation. However, the entire CD is ruined by the unfunny and meaningless talking by ""Ron"" on the disk that preceded each song. The crowning insult was the talking and ""crying"" over the ""Shannon"" tune. I had to eject the CD during the song as I couldn't stand to listen to it any further. Do yourself a favor, skip over this CD!"
3,"Great compilation, poor execution","I purchased this album expecting a great compilation of 70's music... In that regard this album does not disappoint. The down side is that every song has ""Ron Burgundy"" speaking in the beginning (and sometimes middle) of the tracks. I am a fan of the movie, and the first listen is entertaining, but the jokes get old very fast. I ended up purchasing the tracks individually from Amazon MP3 to avoid the interruptions so this CD is now collecting dust."
5,Relaxing with the sounds of nature,"I'm very surprised this cd does not have more reviews, and it is too bad that there are no samples to listen to. My husband and I love this cd, we've owned it for 7+ years. It is truly relaxing and beautifully integrates the sounds of nature with musical instruments. Its perfect for listening to out in nature, or going to sleep to. If you like this cd I would also recommend Canyon Lullaby and by Carlos Nakai, Inner Voices."
3,"More 12"" long versions--EDITED","Disco Nights is the series that should have--but didn't go the extra mile. Promising Extended and Long Versions, it always makes sure no song runs much more than 7 minutes, even if that means editing 12"" versions. This time around, you get:1. Celebration (5:00)2. Shake Your Groove Thing (6:41)3. Let It Whip (4:32) (not the 12""!!!)4. FLashlight (5:49) (the full version is over 10 minutes long)5. Stomp (6:03)6. Sugar Pie Guy (4:37) (not the 12"")7. Got To Give it Up (6:03) (original is over 11 minutes long)8. Jungle Boogie (3:07)9. Burn Rubber (5:34)10. Put Your Body In It (6:06)11. Don't Let Go (7:21) (edit of 12"" version)12. Hang on in there (5:08)"
3,Ok cd but lacks consistency,"The first four songs are good. the best is ""let it whip"" closely followed by george clinton's ""Flashlight"". The rest of the cd is mediocre. Unless you want to buy the cd for those two songs, pass it up."
4,Bringin' the 70s back to life in a funky way!,"When I first picked up this disc, I wasn't too impressed with it. But it grows on you. My favorite track is ""Flashlight"" by Parliament. What a low, dirty bass line! It shakes you body and soul!Marty says, ""Check it out! It doesn't suck!"""
3,"Short, But Sweet","This disc contains two of Jeff Foxworthy's performances, each about 30 minutes long. Thirty minutes is a bit short for a standup routine, but including a pair of them does make the DVD worthwhile, even if it feels like slightly less than a full show. Foxworthy jokes about single life, married life, his firstborn, and of course, includes some 'you might be a redneck' jokes. His recollections of being single and broke are particularly amusing. All of the material is solid, and there are no slow spots to speak of. The subject matter of the two shows overlap a bit, which makes them feel a tiny bit redundant when watched back-to-back, but the jokes are unique. This DVD doesn't represent the best that Foxworthy has to offer, but he has an excellent rapport with his audience and delivers smoothly and with superb timing. This should be considered good viewing for most comedy fans."
1,This would be fun and educational but Galt messed up,"My children used an older version of this type of marble game and went bonkers over it. The toy we used was a friends. My wife bought Galt's version and I am ready to toss it into the garbage can. I just hope the retailer will accept a return. The problem is that Galt's materials engineers cut back on the connector strength and the pieces do not stick together well. All it takes to knock this toy down is a minor bump. My kids were totally frustrated and so was I. This was not an issue with the toy my friend had.Galt, you saved a few pennies on plastic on each set you built but you created a useless toy. Two thumbs down!!!!!!"
1,Pinching Pennies Cost Customer,"This toy thoroughly dissapointed me from the moment I handed it to my child. I remember playing with it's quality predecessor as a child. These memories were dashed by the shoddy workmanship evident by the makers of this ""product"". The connectors were too short and were seperated by the slightest bump. There were not enough tube connectors to build a tower of any great height. Even the marbles were of different sizes and shapes which prevented a proper roll even if the tower managed to hold together. This toy is a total waste of money and I will be returning it shortly. The company should spend a few more cents and make a quality product."
4,Liked it,"I really like this toy, but would highly suggest getting maybe 2 sets. There are only 30 pieces, and the set it pretty small. Otherwise great toy."
3,Thought he would enjoy it more...,"Not a very sturdy product, and doesn't stand up very well on carpet. We try and play this game often, but my son (4) often gets frustrated with its lack of stability and gives up. Better options out there to teach creativity."
3,At least it is slightly educational.,"But will you kids love it? That is the question. It may teach your kids about gravitational forces, or actiona and reaction, all you like but will your kids like it? Yes. The downside is that they will only enjoy it after you set up the toy. Some parents want a toy they pull out of the box and never have to touch. You have to assemble this one everytime. It's not as easy for kids to assemble as you would hope. Good luck with this one."
5,Great Toy!!!,I have one of these at my house and my grandsons LOVE it!!! I just bought 2 more for birthday presents. It is fun to play with for both kids and adults. I would say the age range is 3 years old and up. Endless ways to build it and they ask for it almost every day.
4,Great game but could have been better,"The DS graphics make of this a very well done game. It combines the stylus movements with the buttons without making it hard or complicated.The story is whole new and the gameplay is great.One of its downsides is that, unlike past Pokemon games, here you can't take pokemon with you through the game, they will only help you once and then they're gone.You will only have one Pokemon partner at all times, and you can't chose it its pluse for girls and minun for boys, those are the only downsides here.It'a a fun game to past free time and will entertain kids for hours, the downsides are minimal if you compare them to the good points. Overall a good game."
5,Really Fun But Short,"When I got it I was really really excited! My Friend got it for Christmas and let me try it out, and I loved it. But some pokemon are really hard to catch like Charzard! I wish they didnt have that weird pokemon band though, it was soooooooooooooooo boring! The intro was long, but the action part was short and I wish they had made it longer! But over all, it was awsome!"
3,my review,"This is a great pokemon game! i am a hardcore pkmn fan,but i think they can do better. it is alittle too easy except for closer to the end and on ranger net. i beat the game in 2 days! i heart psycic and fighting poke assists. i use them alot. raquaza and deoxis are hard."
1,BORING!!,"I bought my DS & it came with the pokemon rangers game. I thought that it would be similar to the old blue & red versions but it was nothing like them. the game has you use your stylus & you move it around the pokemon a couple of times & you ""catch"" them. Now in this game you dont catch pokemon, you can only have one pokemon friend & all the others you catch get released back into the wild after they help you(if a water pokemon helps put out a fire he leaves). The game play was very boring and to my surprise the graphics are slightly better than the original games, which is surprising due to the system that it is made for. Essentially a small child, 8 or under, would probably have fun with this game(which is who this game is made for anyways) but if your looking for game play like the originals where you have to improve your pokemon & catch them, then stay with the GB Advance games."
2,Exculde the Game!!,"My friend got this game for her birthday and she wouldn't stop playing it!!! I had saw it on tv and thought it looked really cool. But next week at school, she said you could save in only certain spots and that she just finished the intro! I imedentily took it off my christmas list. So this game I think is a WASTE OF MONEY! Use it on a better game like Mario Kart DS."
4,The point?,"I do not own the game, but I have read several reviews, so I can only give the game three stars since I've never played it. So whats it about? You capture pokemon with a new device thing, woo hoo. I am a true pokemon fan, I have been playing games and trading cards since I was 3. I am now ten, but I'd like to know what the games actually about before I buy it."
4,Pokemon Ranger,My son wanted this game as a Christmas gift....I ordered it from Amazon and had it delivered for the same price I could have bought from anywhere else.Thanks Amazon!
3,"Addictive, but could be better","As a long-time Pokémon fan, I figured I had to give this game a chance. That, and I wanted Manaphy in Diamond. But anyway, I got addicted pretty quick. Unfortunately the plot line was over pretty quick too. After clocking in less than 10 hours of saved game time (add in about 1 more hour for when I died after a save point), I had beaten the game. Due to my short attention span and loss of patience when I got stuck, it took me 2 days to beat.I do like that once you beat the plot line there are additional tasks, which I am still in the process of doing... But I have a feeling those will run out soon, and I'll be done.Good game, but far too short!"
2,"Fun, yet very dissapointing","Being a huge fan of normal pokemon games I expecteed this one to be a lot of fun, it was a huge dissapointment. Once you get to the part where I am and you have to catch a stupid Salamence you'll never want to play again. I have put over 6 hours into trying to catch the dang thing and I have practicly broken my DS lite through anger. Just trust me If your buying this game because you like d p or and other pkmn games then dont! I want ppl 2 C this so plz say u thought it was helpful."
3,Pokemon Ranger,I was pleased with my purchase. I received in perfect condition and it came before it was expected. Thank You!!!
4,"Structured, but fun","This game is more structured than the pokemon RPGs, but it is still quite fun. Capturing pokemon is fairly easy, and I really like how much you can use the ds stylus. I would recommend this game to any pokemon fan, and if you have never played a pokemon game, I would recommend this as a good introduction to the franchise because it is (so far - I am not finished yet) a simpler game and doesn't require as much patience to build up a collection of pokemon."
3,My son loves Pokemon,"As much as my son loves Pokemon, he does not play this game as much as I had anticipated. He has made no comments nor asked me to see what he is doing in the game. He just seems to be more interested in other games for his DS."
4,Not quite up to date,This book is fun to read. Not sure that all the information is up to date. Think I would cross check the restaurants with Google's new global search engine before I left the ground just to be sure they still exist.
5,Wife loves it,Wife loves this little bug. Great for travel. She ordered another one after the first one worked so well? Highly recommend this little cute efficient animal.
3,"Should be titled ""Problem Prevention""","If you have a dog who is already set in his ""ways"" this book is a waste of time. The emphasis is on how to prevent your dog from developing bad behavior. Some of the tips are not practical at all and did not work on my dog. The beginning of the book WAS informative, however, and might be useful to a puppy owner or buyer."
4,Excellent insight into dog behavior!,"I have been a long-time dog owner. Despite what I thought was a fairly good grounding in dog behavior, I was recently confronted with a puppy who changed my attitudes about what I knew. In trying to train and work with my dog, Gizmo, I was looking for guidance and help from any source possible. I happened across this book at my local pet supply store. (In fact, I'm ordering another copy of the book because Gizmo ate the first one!) It turned out to be one of the most educational and helpful books I've ever chanced upon. I would highly recommend it to any dog lover who wants some greater insight into their dog's behavior and positively altering with gentleness and understanding."
1,Barely even addressed a MAJOR dog problem - barking!,"I'm extremely disappointed in this book, and that the authors don't further address the problem of overzealous barking in dogs. Their advice? Walk the dog more so it's not bored. Yeah... that's great except my dog gets two hours of exercise daily along with tons of doggie puzzles and stimulation and STILL she barks at every noise she hears outside. She barks inside, outside, EVERYWHERE. It seems like she's trying to ""alert"" me to something. I don't reward the behavior and STILL SHE PERSISTS. And she's otherwise a very calm dog, and definitely not bored. They barely dedicate a paragraph to one of the MOST frustrating and hard-to-fix of all dog problems. I almost want my money back, I'm so irritated. THANKS FOR NOTHING, DAVID AND RUTH WESTON!!!!!!"

4,Some great guidance,This book has some excellent herbal formulas and acupuncture protocols. I've found Dr. Liang's protocols particularly helpful in blood stasis and qi stagnation cases.
3,Very technical read for a patient!,"This book is a compilation of case studies. It is a technical read for a patient of acupucture going through IVF. There is a ton of valuable information in this book, it's just very hard to get through it if you aren't trained to decifer all the lingo. For a doc, I'm sure it's an easy read!"
4,Very informative,This book has given me great insight as to how to deal with IVF patients and give me more confidence in working with patients who are coming to me for fertility treatments.
3,Good Book,"This is a must for acupuncturists practicing in fertility. However, there is very little information in the book. Still it is a nice addition to a more complete library, by a woman with modern USA hospital experience."
3,Okay Webcam,"This webcam is pretty okay. It looks cute, small, and fits right on top of your laptop. However, without SUPER CRAZY ADDITIONAL lights you really can't see anything and the image is pretty ""grainy""."
3,Cute but not worth,If you are looking for quality image/pic then this should be last option. You need to have a very high high high lights in room to get a clear image. It looks cute..fits in well but not worth if u r looking for quality image.
3,Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks,"Quality under strong lighting is decent, but videos with indoor lighting (at night) are too dark. There is a ""light enhancing"" feature for use with indoor lighting, but the colors are off and image quality is degraded. I have not tried other web cams in this price range. But it seems like this level of quality is satisfactory for the price."
2,poor quality,"this camera does not work well, unless there is direct sunlight to your face. otherwise the image is very dark, and you can hardly see your face."
2,Dissapointed,"Supposedly this is a good brand for a webcam, but I think its one of the worst quality web cams I have ever seen! The color is awful, it always seems blurry no matter what adjustments I have made, and having this cam on a notebook, you can't adjust the cam so that you see more than just someone's face. Its too close up!!! It also doesn't fit very well on my notebook either. I'm just not at all happy with it."
1,Low price / Poor quality,"Yes it is cheap, but the image is very poor.THe camra sensor does not handle poorly lit rooms. You need much light in order to see the other person. The resolution it self is also low making the picture quality bad.The clip did not fit on our laptop aswell."
4,Worth the price,I actually bought the webcam in bundle with the Logitech headphone and it was a cool deal. The webcam is very convenient to use and my all friends and family have commented that they can see me clearly. It can very conveniently be fixed on the laptop screen and rotated around at 360 degrees. The only thing I did not like is it hangs sometimes and you have to click on the broadcast option. So you have to constantly make sure the webcam is working or is at still.
3,Good for the price,"Small, lightweight, pretty easy to setup. Picture quality good in good to bright light, but falls off quick as lighting dims. Getting the various IM programs to use it can consume tons of time though."
5,Great value for money,"Does what it's supposed to: show your ugly face to the world. Sure it's not HD quality, but for 35 bucks what do you expect. Bottom line: if you're on a budget, buy it. If you're not and are tempted by a more expensive product, buy it anyway; you can always donate the price difference to charity."
5,quick and easy with great quality,"I am very happy with this webcam. It was quick and easy to set up, and the quality is suprisingly good.Produces a nice light image for skype and other video chat services."
2,I thought Logitech was one of the best!!!,This camera broke down a few days after i bought it and it won`t hold on my notebook anymorew unless i tape it!!! Had to buy another one. Looks cute but not strong enough.
2,Logitech Quickcam,"The cost of this web cam justifies the quality of its video image and capture. However, I would expect a little more for my money. The major problem is the lack of control over the camera's adjustments. Despite, endless tinkering with the resolution, the picture quality is extremely grainy. Also, it is impossible to find a suitable color-shade adjustment: the flesh-tones of people's face either appear bright-magenta, or a dim shade of blue. The web cam is supposed to be compatible with all notebooks, but it won't clip onto my laptop's lid. Overall, this product definitely left something more to be desired, but is a good buy for anyone looking to spend under $40."
3,good cam for chatting,"This cam give the basic thing for chatting. if you are not interesting in other future, this cam will be the perfect one for you."
1,Drivers don't work. Stay away!,"I fought with this cam for a whole day before giving up and buying a Microsoft VX. As I wish I had known before buying, there are lots of notes out on the web about problems with the Logitech drivers. I tried all the suggestions out there and still could not get reliable performance with Skype. It eventually stopped blue-screening the whole system (WinXP SP2), but videoconf freezes no matter what I do. Life is too short to mess with something like this - save yourself the trouble."
1,pathetic low ligh performance,"Got this one for the sleek looks and thought it would be great product.. unfortunately i'm shattered with its performance. the images are too grainy, dark and you will look like a ghost unless you are in daylight...or maybe in floodlights.Definitely not suggested for home use especially night use. I never used the mic present as I had a logitech headphone...so dn't know abt it.This was a disaster after Logitech Quick Cam Pro 5000 which I had. So go for it instead of it, if u dn't mind using a desktop version."
2,....,It's okay but the color takes a while to adjust itself and the picture isn't all clear and sometimes it shuts itself off when it wants to. I have alot of memory and not many programs running and it still does the same
1,worst web cam ever,"this has been the worst web cam I've ever experienced. The picture is horrible, I look like I'm in Paris Hilton's next night vision video (minus the sex), but worst of all is the sound quality, it makes a really annoying buzzing noise that ranges from tolerable to wanting to flush this thing down the toilet. If you do want to take your chances with this one, keep the packaging and test it out right away so you can make the necessary return."
1,Not good,"Logitech Quickcam for Notebooks ( 961404-0403 )This product is not working good,vedio quality is not coming well,its look like balck and white vedio."
1,worth for it's price,"A Good Webcam in it's price range.Good quality of picture but under low light conditions picture is not so good, but not bad.."
2,Weak camera...waste of money,"I had hope this wouldn't be your typical plastic cam with wimpy software, botchy installation and bad quality. Nope, it was. Been through lots of webcams....this one is a standard junky filler camera to get to the masses. I just returned it."
1,Pathetic Web Cam. Never buy it,Worst webcam I have ever seen. The image is so blurr and hardly anything you can make from that. Also the image is too much dotted. Hardly you can say the design is for webcam sch a pathetic webcam is this.
4,Affordable and works just fine,I have been using this webcam for quite some time now and it works just fine.Pros : Fits perfectly to my DELL 700m and its flexible ball head is maneuverable. USB connected. Microphone works great(infact have stopped using my headphones with mike also from logitech).Cons : Needs the subject to be well lit with lightWould defintely recommend to all users and with that pricetag its a steal !
2,Decent in a well-lit room,"This a decent and capable webcam for the price...as long as you're in a well-lit room. Personally, I like to keep my computer room dark so I'm not too thrilled with this camera - I was hoping the light from my monitor would be enough but my image is completely dark, even with a small lamp on in the room. I have to turn on the overhead light when using this camera.The good part is that the picture is very acceptable (while never great) in those conditions. Considering the low price, and small size, this is an okay webcam. It's intended for notebooks but I figured I could use it for my desktop and just clip it onto my flat-panel. No can-do. The clip doesn't spread apart enough to do that so i just affixed it to the back of my panel with some double-sided tape.Looking back, I probably wouldn't buy this camera again."
4,Great product for Low Value,I purchased this few days back as my first web cam and the quality of picture and sound is very clear....It's a worthy product to buy and enjoy....
3,Pay attention to the screen depth!,"Not a bad camera for the cost. But, beware of the depth of your laptop screen. Mine was too deep and the clip could not expand wide enough to accept it. And I would not consider my laptop to be overly big."
3,Light source req,"This camera works Ok , it needs a bright light source at the back to clearly see the image.For 30$ it is good starter but if you are concerned about image clarity ,then this is not the right one."
5,Logitech Notebook Quickcam,"I purchased two of these web cams so my boyfriend/now husband and I could video chat while I was away in grad school. The cam was easy to set-up, worked well, and still works almost 4 years later."
2,"mic quality is bad, picture is less than mediocre","The voice quality of the mic is really bad, can't use it. The picture is kinda ok, though not to the level of the average. Doesn't work well with vista, it locked the vista computer several times"
1,Does not work and not supported by Logitech?,"I couldn't get this to work more than once or twice in Skype (even though it says it's certified) and that only after I UN-installed the software and drivers that came with the camera. It also didn't work with a number of other webcam apps, such as web based flash sites. I tried to look on logitechs site for driver updates, but couldn't' even find this products, even when clicking on show all cams for all times. I don't' know if this is some proprietary item made by Logitech for someone else, but I would steer clear..."
3,Value for money,This is my first [notebook] camera. Well designed. good quality for transmitting online. bottom line - value for money [bought it for ~ $30].
2,it doesn't work well,"It is not as good as recommended. The image is really unclear when the light is not strong, and it's totally white under strong light. The contrast is low.It's not a good product, useless"
3,Could not test unit - platform issue,"I cannot indicate the quality or value of this product. I could not use it on a Mac OS X 10.4 machine.The indications here at Amazon are correct and should be followed precisely: This particular Quickcam only supports up to 10.2, and only for certain things. It is clear from the Logitech main site that they do not intend to proffer support for any OSX version later than 10.2. Don't purchase this ""in hopes that you can get it to work."""
4,Moneys worth...,"It's definately the moneys worth. It's not the best but it's really good quality. The best part about this Web Cam is that it comes with a microphone. Since I don't have one on my laptop, it's very convient for me to have one. Not only do I have a mic, but a camera as well. I'd recommend buying it. BTW: I did compare this product to other sites (not sure if I can name them) but this was the best price for the very same product. Other sides had it starting at 39.99 to 49.99. I always do research first. I'd recommend this Web Cam for people who are looking for a small (literally for a notebook), 4 star rated camera.Overall: 4 StarsQuality: 3.5 StarsPrice: 5 Stars"
1,Terrible sound and quality,"I bought this webcam for my boyfriend as a Christmas present. I had decided to go ahead and purchase it because the reviews here said that it was pretty great.Nope.My boyfriend and I tried to video chat and the video quality is disgusting! So pixilated and choppy!! Also, anytime he'd cough or accidentally make any ""loud"" (actually just not really quiet) sound, the mic and sound would go CRAZY with static! Even when he wouldn't cough, it would just spontaneously stop working and go wild with static. It drives me crazy, and now I know I'll have to buy him a new, better webcam.What a total and complete waste. I don't recommend this product to anyone."
4,Logitech QuickCam,This is a nice web-cam. The image quality is good and it was easy to set-up. The inclusion of a microphone is nice although I haven't used this yet(I have a separate microphone).Overall pretty good for the price. No problems yet after a few months.
3,quick cam review,"This is an okay camera for the moneypicture is a bit grainy and it's not as clear as cameras I've seen that are more money-but it's pretty good/adequate but not professional quality/Good for just chatting with friends, but not for taking GREAT picturesI'd rate it 'ok'for the price..the size is good for notebooks, it takes up very little space and fits nicely on the top..Not a bad little camera..but not for professional quality pics."
4,Excellent purchase,This was an excellent purchase I really like the camera it's a little dark and the microphone has a a bit of an echo but I use it for skype and it works just fine. I would definitely recommend this product. It was easy to install and use. The case is very handy since I'm moving around so much and the camera itself fits nice right on top of my laptop. You do however need good lighting so if your going to use it in a room thats really dark you may not get a great picture.
5,Great teaching tool,"I'm a preschool swim instructor at my local YMCA. When it thunders, we do ""land"" activities since we are unable to go into the pool. It is hard to keep the attention of 3-6 year olds who came expecting a swim lesson, especially since our ""thunder kits"" are geared to older children. I set out to find 3 or 4 books to use specifically for this purpose. I immediately added this one to my cart when I saw it. It is adorable and has a great message. It is quick enough to read to the kids and leaves enough room for safety discussion. It goes along beautifully with the safety pieces we have built into our water lessons also.I put the CD on in my car for my 2 young sons to listen to and they loved it as well. My 6 year old asked why they kept playing the song over and over again, while the 3 year old sang the song over and over again. I told my older son that that was the point. Get the rules in their head by repetition and song and now his little brother will be extra safe in the pool."
5,Great teaching tool,This book was great for my 4 year old twins. They no longer try to climb the pool fence and instruct others entering the pool to wear a sage life vest and have a grown up watch you. The background to the story is touching. Stewie reached the heart of my kids!
3,"Cute, but not what I was looking for","I am a water safety instructor who teaches swimming lessons according to American Red Cross Guidelines. I teach outside so on days it rains we have to find other activities. I thought this book would be perfect for my younger students, but the Red Cross already makes a book close to what this book is teaching. I think this book is perfect for parents who want their children to know about water safety if they have a pool or grow up/vacation around bodies of water. Touching story as to why the parents wrote the book. I admire them for what they have done."
5,Life-saving lessons,"This is a wonderful resource for parents, teachers and coaches. Stewie the Duck is one of the few books available that addresses drowning, one of the most significant injury-related risks our children face. The authors teach children critical survival skills in a loving, age-appropriate, and fun way. Children really enjoy the CD, and being able to incorporate music makes the lessons fun and effective. This adorable, intelligent book was so impressive that we utilized it in our water safety curriculum program, and have received very positive feedback about it."
3,"cute book, excruciating cd","While it's not particularly well-written (the prose is fairly awkward in places), this book is really quite good at presenting water safety rules in a way that kids will want to read, and the song will definitely help them remember. This is a book my daughter has repeatedly asked me to read and I am happy to do it. However, I really wish I had previewed the included cd before I played it for her, because while she likes to listen to it, the condescending speech of the voice-over actors and the off-key singing of the children are like nails scraping across a blackboard to me. It is really and truly awful. That being said, my daughter does like the cd and I'm willing to grit my teeth while we listen to it if it means she'll be safer around water."
3,Read if you are thinking of walking the trail,"I enjoy hiking and have often fantasized of taking six months off from work and hiking the Appalachian trail. Reading this book, a diary of one who completed the trail, and who was subject to frequent bad weather and mice crawling over him in trail shelters, among other things, brought me back to reality. I would give the book 4 stars were it not for the many typographical errors I found."
1,Needs a proof reader,I have to believe that this book was self published. No reputable (or unreputable for that matter) publisher would print a book with as many spelling errors as this one had. I cannot imagine that even the author bothered to read it through prior to printing and missed this many spelling errors. One can find as good of trail journals on the internet for free. I wouldn't bother buying this book.
1,FAULTY CD,"Best Of Bill Medley, TheI have now purchased two of these CD's, ""The Best of Bill Medley"" from Amazon.com. The first CD was faulty the first time I tried to listen to it. It played the first two songs, and would play no others. Since CD's can only be returned if unopened, I had no options. So, I ordered the CD a second time. This one, too, is faulty the first time I tried to listen to it. This one played the first four songs and would play no others. I'm very disappointed."
2,Why did I buy this one?,I listened to the entire CD and I'm left wondering why I even bought it? It's definitely not one of my favorites.
2,rememba da early nineties dance music,"...in all its flaccid wimpy glory. French Kiss, Back To Life~ These were da anthems back in '89. Everybody wearing dem high top fades, the ""eraserhead"", we called it. How about dem Puerto Rican Fence Climber shoes everybody wore and the ""Houser"" vests~Ha! You rememba>>? Very Cheesy by today's standards, and dated...Back in da day...it was DA SCHNITZEL!"
4,Sample of Classics,"The collection is less than comprehensive, but it's a good sample of soft classic house. It'll keep the memories alive. Especially the last track."
4,The days of house music and clubs are back with this cd.,"If you missed the fun of the Eighty's...take heart. The House is open with the tunes we moved with. St. Andrew's 431 East, The Shelter, Bonnie Brook Country Club and the College life are back again. Greeks, Meeks, Freaks and Weeks."
5,DonnerPartyDonnerPartyDonnerParty!!!,"This has to be one of my favorite bands of all time. For neigh on 10 years I have been placing notes on the net looking for their first record (released in 1987 and absolutely unobtainable). I've done innumerable searches & learned more than I ever wanted to know about cannibalism in early America--but, this is all irrelevant. They combine sweet folky music & straighforward rock with- er, well, some unusual lyrics. If you like Dogbowl, and early King Missle you will love these guys as well. I'm soooo happy that their material has been rereleased!"
1,"Awful, Do Not Waste Your Money!","This could go down as one of the worst albums ever. I am a huge fan of teen pop and was very excited to get this cd. It has Nsync, LFO, O-Town, and Innosense.All Cd's that I own and that I love. These artists are the only good thing about this cd but the songs are still bad. They all sound like demos, songs that weren't finished and were never intended to be released. The other artists are no names and there is a reason for that. The songs are boring and the singing is awful. Flat harmonies and rediculous lyrics. I cringed on some of the songs. This is an embarrassment to pop music."
1,All the World Needs Right Now,"This CD is all what the world needs right now. It's a mixture of bands that will appeal to the normal 11 year old girl. But it's a very tasteless compliation of music. I'm not trying to put down NSYNC or LFO, but we're [inexpensive] way of making some extra money on the side. Innocense? Oh come now.. where do you think these girls will be in a few months? Nowhere. I suggest you save your money and just download the songs if you're hardcore fan enough. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,A Disappointment of a CD,"I bought this CD mainly because it contains an unreleased 'N Sync song. I thought that the entire CD would be good, too, since its a big compilation of teen pop artists. I THOUGHT it would be good...it wasn't. 'N Sync's song is pretty good,not their best ever, but decent. I was disappointed in the rest of the CD however. It is a compilation of album-rejected songs, that all wound up in one compilation...."
1,I thought it would be good because of all the good reviews.,"But it wasn't. Yeah it's weird and I appreciate that, but I think you should be prepared before watching it by knowing that it has absolutely no plot what so ever. At least gummo has some sort of story. I could barely finish watching this movie, don't waste your time with it."
3,Some Funny Scenes,"It is hard to comment a set of events mixed in time and space as producers try visualizing a schizophrenic vision of a major character by deploying sometimes even more insane deeds of seemingly normal citizens-or not diagnosed appropriately yet (watchPsychiatry: An Industry of Death)?I wanted this movie badly since ages, after seeingGummoandKids, and simply happy to find a shop in NYC providing this work for $5 (about $32 in Australia and $13+tax in the States mostly).Need one more comments?"
1,Julien Who?,"I am someone who truly loves film of art. This is not it. It is a crap movie with absolutely no charactor development, no plot, no purpose and no direction With cheap visual effects such as high gain on the cameras to give it a B.S. grainy feel to the over saturation of color in post, this movie just blew! If you watch this movie all the way through, make sure there are no loaded weapons in the room. You'll want to use it on yourself! -5 stars and sucking."
1,Not like Gummo or Kids!,"I was waiting for this movie to come out on DVD only to find out it was a big dissapointment. The filming is grainy, supposed to be hip and stylish but I think it's very annoying. The movie 'Kids' and 'Gummo' where much better, this movie is nothing like them. Also the blatant promoting of his wife featured in every one of his movies is getting old too. Harmony Korine, sorry to say pal, you just went from my hero to a big zero!"
3,so-so,"I had already watched Gummo and KIDS and loved those movies, so when I discovered this film I had to watch it. I'm not sure if my expectations were just too high or if the movie was just not that good, but I was disappointed with it. The movie was really hard for me to finish. It lacked a story line or plot even more so then Gummo, and I feel like the whole movie nothing happened. I feel like it was a movie I had to watch, but I would not want to watch it again."
5,Stunning Achievement,"The level of reality is incredible. Herzog is unforgettable. Avoids every cliche, hits hard, takes you into another world more real than the one you will encounter when you walk out of the movie house. I am hoping for some sort of release of HK's fight project footage but I'm grateful for this film. He doesn't get mainstream respect but as the saying goes ""a real artist is either despised or despicable"" and he is not despicable."
3,oblique,"More experimental than not, a hard-edged take on schizophrenia through one member of a dysfunctional northeast urban family. In his commentary Korine states an intent to deromanticize schizophrenia (uh, where/when has it been romanticized?) What does impress is how blazingly Werner Herzog savors his performing, just short of hamming. The other performers also seem strongly committed to the narrative. A video film that should appeal to the noir crowd. Likely an acquired taste, but Herzog affectionados should not hesitate."
4,I can't believe it!,"My daughter broke the passenger's side mirror on our 98 Suburban when she failed to fold it in before going through the carwash. I expected a replacement to cost $200 or something ridiculous. I couldn't believe there was an exact match for only $20.95. I got it 5 days later and installed it with only minor trouble. Installing the mounting nuts was difficult. My hands are large and they are in a very narrow space. The only flaw I noticed is a vibration in the mirror glass while travelling over bumpy roads. I am sure I tightened the mounting bolts very securely. I think the spring that controls the folding feature just isn't as strong or ""loaded"" as the OE. It really doesn't bother me, just an observation."
1,Stay away from Best Price Mirror - Seriously,"I ordered new mirrors for my Chevy Suburban, but after weeks of waiting for the mirrors, I complained to Amazon/Paypal, and they promptly cancelled the deal. After contacting the seller, he claimed to have tried to get in touch with me on the phone. When contacting the seller on their phone number, it was only an answering machine.Despite several requests through email, the seller did not get back to me with information about having shipped, or plans to ship.Based on the above, you should avoid this seller, and rather look for someone who actually will communicate with you, and not at least send you what you paid for."
1,imo,"The only song that is worth listening to is Eagle bassist Randy Meisner's ""hearts on fire"" a great song that is stuck to a bunch of b sides like fly strips. You can find ""hearts on fire"" in better compilations."
3,"Good collection, except for one thing","If you're considering buying this CD because of ""Sausalito Summernight"", BEWARE: the song has been edited to the point of butchering. The intro has been shortened and the entire second verse (""Hot summernight in Sausalito /Can't stand the heat another mile"", etc) is missing. A Dutch compilation has a ""single edit"" which is longer and does include the second verse, so it is a really short version you're getting here. Apart from that, the collection is faultless. I didn't know most of the songs and I liked them all. But if it's the Diesel track you're after, the original album is soon to be reissued including the full-length version."
2,Don't use too much,"Since Sorbee Sugar-Free Maple-Flavored Pancake Syrup has sorbitol in addition to Splenda, don't use too much, or you may find yourself running to the bathroom (sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, has a laxative effect)."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product as a gourmet item. It has no special flavor, texture is watery, and the price too high for the miniscule amount provided - approximately two servings per bottle with pancakes."
3,Just average.,It's a good option for a diabetic since real maple syrup has about 40 carbs per serving and this is just a few. I prefer just a sprinkle of splenda with cinnamon to cover over the artifical taste.
1,Misleading write-up,"The add pictures the clamp and the strap. It says 2 piece. The clamp would be one piece and the strap would be the other piece. So, I ordered two. Actually, this write-up doesn't include the word that is on the front of the box (i.e., replacement). So each pack contains to replacement straps and no clamps. I now have 4 replacement clamps and no straps. As is they are useless to me."
2,Five Stars for Music but NO stars for encoding issues,"This is a beautiful album filled with **WONDERFUL MUSIC** that is unfortunately marred by buzzing and rattling on the last three or four tracks. At first I thought it was just my digital downloads but discovered the same encoding problems on the Amazon preview samples for the same tracks. Is the CD master defective or is the encoding to blame? Only the Shadow knows and he isn't talking.How do I rate a CD like this? Five stars for music, no stars for encoding so I guess we'll split the difference."
1,TURNED TEA JET BLACK,Loved the look of the pot. First cup of green was great. Second cup came out jet black. seems like the enamel is cheep.
3,"ehh,,,,just ok",I bought this toy for it's durability after having issues with the floor cloth play gyms toy arches falling over. The one positive thing about this is that it IS sturdy and wipeable. As you can see it's pretty limited. Toys are not interchangable and it's not travel friendly. Baby only hold interest for a few minutes and got pretty old after only a few weeks or so. I would almost recommend it for a home daycare due to it's durability and ability to be easily disinfected but if it's being purchased for in home use I'd recommend spending your money on something else.
4,An Entertaining Read,"What I liked most about this book is ""the what if factor"". As you read it you can't help thinking what if I had wings? The story is simple. One day people get sick and develop wings. With the wings comes flight of course. However, most modern technology doesn't work well around you. So you're asked. Would you give up television, video games, etc. for flight? The characters are very interesting. We watch as they go through this change and how it affects them. This a very good story that begs for further visits to this world."
4,"Brilliant concept, average execution","The concept of this story is amazing: an AIDS-like disease causes otherwise-normal folks to turn into modern, living and breathing angels. Sosnowski started off with a bang, but by the time the story wanes, my interest faded as well.The characters are good, the writing crisp and witty (almost too witty in places), but I think it carried on a bit longer than it should've.I would like to read more of his work, though, and I do recommend it as a paperback"
4,Mr Favor! Mr Favor!,"Video quality is pretty good.Some of the shows are great, and some others are a bit strange.Either they had different writers, or the writers got into the peyote again...."
1,Rawhide doesn't Ride Tall,"I could be urged to give 5 stars to this show, but I just can't do it. Rawhide was one of the best western series for television and it sure deserved 5 stars... but not the product released by greedy Paramount. For it, only 1 star, nothing else. Two volumes for a complete season 2 at $38.99 each (official price) means $ 77.98 for a single season! This is a very high price...and ridiculous too! Paramount is not doing right with the Rawhide series. Why so much focus on Clint Eastwood for the box covers? Eric Fleming was the real star of Rawhide and he is always ""small and in the background"" on the boxes! I understand Clint is famous today, and Eric Fleming is almost forgotten, but he was the main character in Rawhide, and, at the time, a better actor than Eastwood. At least Paramount should give both of them equal focus. Indeed, Rawhide is a great show poorly released by Paramount!"
1,5 Stars for Rawhide 0 Stars for Greedy Paramont,"I love this show and couldn't wait until it was released on DVD. I bought the first season the day it was released, but unfortunately I won't be buying any more until Paramont stops being so greedy. $70 for a full season? Ridiculous! They're doing the same with Gunsmoke. Give fans the full seasons for a reasonable price and I'll purchase every season of both Rawhide and Gunsmoke. Until then, Paramont won't be getting any of my money. These are both great series, don't let the greedy suits a Paramont rip us off!"
1,Rip OFF !!! I won't be buying it !!,At least until the price comes down a LOT.I have enjoyed season 1 and vol 1 of season 2 but vol 2 season 2 costs MORE than all of season one! Sadly at that price it's just not value for money.After all there are so many excellent series available on DVD that the problem becomes which ones do you buy? You have to pick and choose. For the price they are asking I can get a full season of many other shows... and that's what I'll do.
5,Great Stuff,This is much better than the reruns you see on TV. The clarity is so good that you will really enjoy and see how great a show rawhide was.
5,Rawhide: A Classic Western,"The good thing about our country is that everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In my opinion, I am thrilled to know that the Rawhide series continues to be offered. It far outshines many series being offered today on DVD, and it is my hope that, eventually, the entire series will be available. I anxiously await the release of Season 2, Volume 2, and would encourage any fan of Westerns to purchase the Rawhide series for timeless enjoyment of a real classic."
2,Not so hot,"This book was a huge disappointment. I've followed the Warlock series for awhile and I think this has to be the worst, if not one of the worst in the seris. it was terrible. I mean, it felt that Christopher stasheff was trying to pull stuff out of his butt to make it into a working story like the prior Warlock books, but i just didn't buy it. It didn't feel right to me. Currently i am awaiting the book about Gregory, my personal Gallowglass fave, and i'm hoping it'll be up to Stasheff's old standards."
4,vintage cocker,"contains some of his best singing,really good songs, particularly - the moons a harsh mistress and i can stand a little rain"
5,Great eye powder,"I bought this brow powder years ago and started using it as eye shadow. Of all the brown shadows I have ever purchased, this color is the best.I was unable to find it in stores and so elated to find it on Amazon!"
4,Awesome,"The color matched my hair perfectly. I didnt like the brush, its hard to blend the color in with but other than that I like it way better than a eyebrow pencil."
3,which edits do we get from Disco Nights this time?,"don't expect all long versions with this half-decent series. This time around:1. Supernature (6:14) (edit)2. Love & Desire (6:35)(edit)3. I Found Love (5:14)4. hot butterfly (5:22) (remix, not the original)5. Star Wars (6:26) (not 15 minute album version)6. I Love America (3:52)7. love to love you baby (edit)8. don't cry for me argentina (5:08)9. souvenirs (6:22)10. Romeo & Juliet (6:30)11. The Chase (theme from Midnight Express) (5:28) (edit)12. Boogie Motion (3:28)"
4,Finaly a CD with Romeo & Juliet in it !,This is a very good album to have. Good songs and good price.And finaly Romeo&Juliet in CD!This album is a must.
5,A must have for any collection!,"If you are a true disco maniac from 76-77, you will love this CD. These hard to find songs that mostly only came in 12 inch single imports will be appreciated by anyone who really knows the undergroud disco scene."
4,Excellent,I got this product for and installed without any problem. I am not a handyman it took for the first one approximately one hour rest finished in half hour each.. there is some problem with remote it is not quite responsive.
2,No New Information,"This book is quite simply two books pasted together. If you don't have either book, its a great value. But, if you have one of them and think that there are some updates in this version, you're mistaken. Even though WW makes references to this effect in other books (calling it a ""replacement"" for Elysium), it's not technically true: they're the same book."
2,I am not a fan.,"For the most part it works, and also keep in mind if you use 4 springs can be that much more accurate, however the thing is a PITA. First moving springs from point a to point b is next to never easy.You would have to visit gripper or/and fitness forums to try to find the chart that once existed for this product (not sure if I still have it).It's big and bulky so you don't have quite the control you would have with a standard gripper like from IronMind Captains of Crush line.It's primarily IMHO good for static holds. Push against the floor, use two hands to squeeze, then let go with only one hand and try to hold it as long as you. Hence static holds.I sold mine and don't miss it. But I hear tons of people that love it. It really depends on who you ask."
5,outstanding grip device,"Solid as a rock and it works better than traditional grippers. It works beautifully for right and left handed work, unlike other grippers.It's basically 10 hand grippers in one!Thanks!"
5,"40 Years Old, and still working great","This gripper is a take off on the old Iron Man magazine gripper of the same design.--- I purchased mine some 40 years ago, and it still works great.This model is identical to my model...and you can buy extra springs for it if you want more difficulty--- useful if you want to go with two hands instead of one hand which I do as an alternative.Amazon offers several brands of Super Grippers, but they are all the same design--- Ivanko is the ""name"" brand here, but you can't go wrong with any of them (pretty basic)Do yourself a favor...--- buy one of these and a progressive set of Captains of Crush single hand grippers (also on Amazon).--- (don't go and get a #4 CoC unless you really know what you are getting into)"
4,"Works, not for small bottles","It is nice, I am glad I bought it, but it will not work for small bottles, like the throw-away bottles of water you get for 4$ a case.I like the adjustable part, it turns easily and doesn't require an allen wrench, altho to keep it that way what with rain and mud, I might have to spray some oil in there. It does have a socket for an allen wrench, however, which is a plus.I don't have much experience with bicycle water bottle holders other than the old style metal cage I had 20 years ago, but this seems to work just fine, as long as you don't try to use the smaller bottles."
5,Well made cage,"This is a flawless water bottle cage. Installation is simple, and the cage performs very well. It adjusts to hold everything from a standard water bottle to a 32oz Nalgene bottle (I've done this several times) to a plastic water bottle from the likes of Aquafina. Highly recommended."
1,didnt know it needed drilled into bike frame so will not use,My fault for not reading how this was attached to frame. It looks like an excellent product
5,"Fits 16"" frames*","I was disappointed when I discovered my 16"" frame Trek 3700 was too small to properly fit a generic metal cage. Sure, all of the water bottle cages fit, but I can't get a bottle in it to use.I discovered this cage and was happy to see that it was made of an all plastic-back. So if the cage sits to high on the frame you can just drill holes in the cage to make it properly fit to your bike frame. Plus the adjustable fit makes it terrific when your switching from different size bottles. This cage is made of a lightweight plastic and it seems to be built tough which is excellent news to a mountain or cross-country biker. I believe that this cage is the best for the money."
4,Wonderful Invention.,"From what I can tell, this is a quality-made product. It doesn't feel flimsy or overly cheap. I like that it is adjustable using the easy-to-turn nob at the bottom. The only thing I dislike is that it seems as though biking companies really restrict the amount of water one can carry on a bike. For instance, I was hoping this bottle cage could hold a 40 oz. water bottle but it can't. I'm lucky to fit a 27 oz. water bottle in it. It's a quality bottle cage and would recommend it as everyone's standard bottle cage, but I'm really hoping Topeak will up their game and create an adjustable bottle cage that can hold a higher capacity."
5,Well made and good value,I was pleasantly surprised enough with the quality of this product to add to the consensus. It's really well made for the price. A good buy indeed. The adjustable thumbscrew is fantastic too.
2,Bottle holder,"There is simply no way to fasten this product to the bike frame. The holder has two holes in it, but are you supposed to drill holes in the new bike? I would think there would be some instructions, but alas NONE."
5,Clever Idea,What else could you ask for? This product allows you to carry virtually any size bottle of water or beverage and is well constructed. I would not hestitate to reccomend it.
5,Great deal on price & quality,"I've been doing road biking for over a year and recently done few mountain biking trails, and this product, holds up fantastically! It was easy to put on the bike, does not interfere during the ride, and mostly can fit in any water bottle size (standard water bottle size+). It's a great buy for that price!"
2,"Stopped working,kids very disappointed.","Bought this for my 5 year old twins last year for Christmas..they loved it, their Grandmother loved working it with them, I am telling you it was a hit! However, after about one month, it stopped talking on one quarter of the puzzle..the Northwest. I first thought it just needed a battery change, but after trying two sets of new batteries, I realized it was a goner, and no fun if it only partially worked. I buy pretty early for the holidays and taking this back or sending it back is usually limited to 30 days, so, I ended up paying $30.00 for a months worth of toy. It is a great toy, but keep this in mind when you buy, that if it goes bad, you have the reciept, etc."
4,USA Map Puzzle,Has drawer to hold the pieces. Plays America the Beautiful and recites pledge of allegiance. We like it.
5,Wonderful Toy,I bought this map toy for my 4 year old son and he LOVES IT!! He had shown an interest in maps and I thought he would enjoy it. He plays with it everyday and within 2 weeks already has memorized half of the state names and knows where all the state pieces go. The only thing that he doesn't understand is when they give the state nicknames.
2,Good toy if it worked.....,"I like the idea of this toy but the lower half of the puzzle has never worked. I have replaced the batteries and tried various things but... nothing.I was also disapointed at the representation of New England, where I live, and Hawaii, where I used to live. The accuracy of the map lacks something but I can see it would be a good first learning tool, if it worked."
1,GEOGRAPHY,"THE SCHOOLS MAY HAVE REMOVED GEOGRAPHY FROM THE CLASSROOMS, BUT THEY CAN'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM THOSE WHO LEARNED IT MANY YEARS AGO. PRESUMEABLY THOSE OF US WHO WOULD BUY THIS ITEM. TAKE A LOOK AT THE PUZZLE OF OUR GREAT UNITED STATES. NOW, WISCONSIN MAYBE WANTS THAT PART OF MICHIGAN, BUT IT OPERATES UNDER MICHIGAN LAW AND IS CALLED UPPER MICHIGAN OR THE UPPER PENNINSULA OF MICHIGAN. NO WHERE IS IT CALLED WISCONSIN. I WAS RATHER CONFUSED RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PUZZLE SAID THERE ARE 44 PUZZLE PIECES. THE LAST I KNEW, THERE ARE 50 STATES AND 48 CONTIGUOUS STATES. THE IDEA OF THIS TALKING MAP IS GREAT, BUT LET'S GET IT CORRECT FOLKS.GRANDPARENT LIVING IN MICHIGAN"
5,Great educational Buy for 2 and up,"I bought this for my 2 year old last year for Christmas (2007), and this year she is saying the pledge. She can sing. ""O Beautiful"" too. I love this puzzle is it great. The hardest part is keeping the states together. I put them in a bag to keep them together."
1,Where's the Northern Panhandle of West Virginia?,"I'm sure this would be a wonderful map if it were accurate, but this toy, as well as many others, cuts off the northern panhandle of West Virginia. There is a small strip of the state, just a few miles wide that runs along the Ohio river between Ohio and Pennsylvania and it is distressing that so many map makers, particularly ones aimed at teaching our youth, continue to cut it off. I know, I live in Weirton, West Virginia, which is 30 miles west of Pittsburgh, PA.Don't buy this toy if you want your child to know the REAL shape and locations of the United States!"
3,FYI: The actual manufacturer's age is 5+ (on the box),"Amazon incorrectly shows the manufacturer's recommended age as 3+. The box says 5+.Also, the sound quality on this toy is somewhat poor."
5,Good air hose,"What can I say? It's air hose. If you wake up in the middle of the night and realize you need some air hose. Get on Amazon and getcha some. Oh, it's good quality air hose, by the way."
1,Died after 12 months of use,"This was my third Westinghouse LCD Picture frame (purchased all because I thought they looked the nicest at the time). ALL of the Westinghouse digital frames died within a year. I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY ANYTHING FROM WESTINGHOUSE. So sad, their name brand use to be an American Staple back in my mom and dad days. Another American company putting out crappy products manufactured in other countries with just as bad support."
2,Not worth the effort,"Bought this frame on sale, lasted about 1 year...Viewing angle really is horrible, you have to stand right in front of it to see the pics. It does have a nice split screen/random showing of pictures..not worth the money...shop around."
2,The frame is very cheap looking.,"The frame is very cheap looking. This cannot be discerned from the online photo. It you are going to buy this one I highly recommend looking at it in a store before purchasing, to make sure cheap, plastic & tacky is the look you are trying to achieve."
1,Westinghouse honchos have no shame!!,"I received the DPF-1411 as a gift. It started acting up on the first loading of photos. The honchos at Westinghouse have no shame. They have no qualms about ruining the name of an all-american prestigious company by contracting with a substandard chinese manufacturer, skipping QC wholeheartedly, refusing to provide technical support (obviously, since the product is hopeless), but who cares, since all that counts is to sell. Believe me, at that rate, they will not sell for long, and those guys will just add up to the lines of unemployed know-it-alls.Westinghouse 14.1-Inch LCD Digital Photo Frame"
2,Nice item if you can find one that works!!!,"Most of these are junk! We had to go through 3 until we found one that actually worked. First, the USB drive was broken, then the second had a blur on the screen, and the third wouldn't even start up. Made in China - what do you expect? We are now just hoping the fourth one doesn't break!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I BOUGHT THIS FRAME ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF A GO.AFTER 1 AND A HALF YEARS OF 24 HOURS OF RUNNINGTHE SCREEN JUST WENT BLACK AND WOULD NOT TURN ON.ALSO, THE FRAME WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE SOME OF MY .JPGPICS AND I WOULD HAVE TO RESAVE THEM.AND IF YOUR 4 GIG MEMORY CARD HOLDS ABOUT 2 GIGS OFPICTURES THEN IT DOES NOT WORK.JUST DON'T BUY THIS THING."
5,Digital photo frame,This is a wonderful product that amazed everyone to share your photos and videos. What a nice design too! Great product.
4,worth the money,"i am thoroughly enjoying the digital picture frame from westinghouse. a good value for the money. takes a little time to figure out the menu and controls but with a little effort it becomes pretty easy. Good resolution if the picture is quality. quite a few features to play with. optimal picture setting will result in your pictures being automatically resized which can lead to some odd results. no music or sound. however the frame will play videos and loop them continuously. using the internal memory is a bit complicated...still relying on external storage options. i looked at a few other frames such as kodak and was not as impressed. I am happy with the purchase. Rated it four stars because i do think adding sound, better automatic picture sizing (for the most part the frame does a good job) and a more intuitive use of the internal memory would improve the device."
3,Reply to Broadway reviewer,"Geez...how DARE you be so offensive to CoCo? I was born and grew up in America BUT I happen to purchase CDs from artists NOT in my country, inclusive of her, Bocelli, Sarah Brightman, Emma Shapplin, Mika Nakashima...I can go on forever. People can market ANYWHERE they like. Of course J. Lo, Mariah, Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, etc. made waves more.And for crying out loud, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO WRITE ABOUT THE ARTIST HERSELF! You're supposed to review this CD. I know I'm not one to do so, either, so will just say goodbye."
2,Bleeding Heart,"Jack, you persuaded me to buy your book, then to quickly write a review so you could study every word and breath it in.After much hesitation, I am giving in to your second demand.I hope you're not as disappointed as I am.Mr. Vink's book was long and depressing. A better title would be Memoirs of a Narcissistic Sociopath. No wonder he hate's therapists. He left his wife and children for a stranger because of ""love at first sight"". He had unscrupulous illegal dealings in his business life (don't the rest of us wish we didn't have to pay taxes on large earnings!).He made his bed and now he wants us all to join his band wagon and feel sorry for him as he lays in it.He has abused the medium of publishing to get revenge and pity.Note to self: Don't hire an attorney out of the yellow pages.Yes, however, he does have a gift for story telling.Beware ladies, he is now using ""on line dating"" to sell his book. Keep your eyes wide open!"
5,Life as it is.,"Just when you I thought my own life was just about as bizarre as it could get, I found this book. It gave me a way to vent vicariously and move through the betrayals with him. I know I am doing better just for having read this. When one door opens another closes, you just need to keep opening those doors and Jack does. Definitely a book I would recommend to anyone who has ""lived""."
5,A suspenseful autobiography that reads like a mystery novel.,I loved the story and the writing style of this author. He took me places I have never been and will never see but through his eyes I experienced it anyway. A wild book to read with all the ups and downs Jack Vink went through. He has become my favorite writer. Hope to read more of his works.
2,Exotic music but not for me,"I found majority of this CD to be un-inspired and without much melody. If you're searching for good folk or dulcimer music, PASS this one up. One word to describe this CD: DISAPPOINTING."
2,Worked only for sinks,This plunger worked fine for the bathtub and the bathroom sink but failed miserably with the toilet.Our toilet clogged for the first time yesterday. We tried to open it repeatedly whit this plunger for a few hours but the clog didn't budge. The problem seemed to be that the lower end is made of hard plastic which is not plyable at all. It didn't get into the hole to close it off. There was always bubbles coming up that showed that the air did not go into the pipe. In the end we called our landlord who said that this tipe thoesn't work for him either. He had a rubber plunger that is narrower on the bottom. He did just 2-3 blows and the clog was gone.I can't say that this plunger is completely useless since it did work on a flat surface such as a drain in the tub.
2,No longer the Best Product Ever,I have used this bad boy for years with great satisfaction UNTIL I installed a low flush toilet. The plunger doesn't conform enough to seal the shape of the bowl drain and I got a huge overflow blowout on every attempt. So sad.
2,Mixed Review,"The first time I used it on my kitchen sink ""whoosh!"" it cleared a clog I had been working on for days with a small 'regular' plunger in a few pumps. Then I tried it on the bathtub :-( The hard plastic would not form a seal around the drain so it was totally ineffective. Furthermore the hard plastic eventually bent, then cracked and now my Master plunger is on it's way to a landfil someplace. It was probably worth what I paid just to clear the kitchen sink. That chemical stuff is about the same price for a couple of uses which is about what I got out of ""the Master"""
1,Piece of junk,Bought one of these and it did NOTHING for my toilet but create an overflow - it couldn't make a seal. Ended up borrowing my neighbor's tried and true old school plunger which worked beautifully
2,Weak,"Flimsy, awkward and weak. I don't recommend this product. I only gave it 2 stars because it was inexpensive... you get what you pay for."
2,If I had only realized...,"Sadly I can't recall it ever mentioning that this item was NOT RETURNABLE.It also took about ten days for me to get it.Perhaps if there'd have been a picture of how absurd it looks inflated I would have realized it was only potentially suitable if you never intended to use inflated except in a flat water emergency.If I ever had to swim in it, I'd be getting it in my face with that tube constantly.That tube and the pull valve are both out in the open as soon as its inflated. It looks like snagging either on anything would mean no pfd when you need it most.Try one on locally, inflated, before buying it.Giving it two stars only because its well built.It fits poorly and I could only see having one to fulfil a legal requirement when I wouldn't otherwise have had a pfd."
4,Right On!,"I have been looking for this type of PFD for a while. Going to be perfect for the driftboat keeping my boys safe.Got a good deal, pleased with shipping and happy with product."
3,Sospenders review,The only thing I did not like about this product is the way it was made in the area surrounding the neck. It seems that the design is for a child not an adult. The width of the opening is not very big and has a seam where the nylon cover is stiched right at the nexk line. This creats an uncomfortable rubing against the sides of the neck. Other than this complaint the quality of the construction looks very good.
4,Invisible PFD does the job.,"What's nice about the Sterns SOSpenders is that it fits any size person. Next is that it does not interfere with the limited space in a Kayak. I have not had the occasion to deploy it in a real emergency situation but I have practiced using the manual inflation tube and feel that I will be able to manually inflate the PFD and save the use of the CO2 cartridge in the event of a kayak sinking, which any folding kayak can do. And in the event of a capsize due to extraordinary rough water, can release the CO2 cartridge for quick deployment. I'm happy with the security that the SPSpender PFD provides."
1,was mis repentsented,"ordered this because it stated universal sizing however they dont state what the size is on the website, only on the jacket, i wish i would have known this beforehand, then to compound it, they sent and charged me for two jackets, i still havnt been able to get in touch with them. its a sad sad sad thing"
3,Great 'undersaddle' training hints.,I did thoroughly enjoy this book. I have done and read a significant amount of natural training methods so some of the ground work stuff was fairly elementary and sometimes not as 'natural' as I would like - found it to be a little incongruent with the 'positive' and 'saying yes' part of the title.None-the-less the under saddle training suggestions - especially teaching the half halt and circle work - were invaluable and made this book a worthwhile purchase. Like any book I its important to take away what is useful to you and not be too critical of the remainder which may work very well for others.
3,Good intro but needs more detail,"This book provides a good introduction to Active Directory for someone who is new to Windows 2000 server. The quality of writing is much better than what's found in most study guides. For the most part, what it covers is covered in a clear and understandable manner, but there are big gaps in what's covered. Also, I found a couple of really big factual errors.So I'd say, if you are new to Active directory, get this book, and read it quickly once over to get the concepts, but then put it down and find something else to really dig into the details of AD - Something such as the Distributed Systems Guide from the resource kit.One other thing, the binding on my copy broke and now the book is physically falling apart. And I didn't even use it very heavily."
4,Not bad,"70-217: 63 questions & pass/fail. Best MS exam so far.I used this book and also the sybex book. If you do not know what AD is read the ""Introduction to AD"" in the server manual first (technet). This gives you the best intro to AD!!And then use these 2 books to prepaire yourself for the test.To finish it up, use The Transcender test: Study the explanations, use the references that Transcender uses inthe test (technet, Resource KIT etc). AND YOU WILL PASS !!Long exam, but fair.good luck"
1,Incomplete and poorly organized,"I am currently taking a classroom course to get the MCSE, and the Global Knowledge Certification Press MCSE study guides are the books provided by the school. We have two certs left to go, but my class has already convinced the administration to drop these books. Yes, they are that bad. Explanations that assume you already understand the topic, or worse yet assume the topic is self-explanatory are the norm in these books. Labs leave out critical steps that make doing any part of the exercise impossible. All in all, this entire series of MCSE books is not worth your hard earned money. If you are seriously studying for your MCSE, stay as far away from this series as you can."
3,A walk back in time,I found Frances Parker's poetry to be a type of time machine to a place of feelings and emotions longs since forgotten. For the true romantic at heart.
1,DOESNT WORK,"if your looking to buy and airsoft gun that is cheap and work moderatly well this is not the one. the whole gun is pretty good. the plastic is kinda strong the grips sturdy and the stock is really nice but when it comes to the actually shooting. it doesnt work. when you pull back the lever it just makes a really bad sound and doesnt cock fully. i think there might be something wrong with the gearbox. I didnt bother returning it becasue i didnt buy it for shooting i bought it as a prop for a youtube seris. overall gun sucks, looks cool, good prop."
2,Very bad gun,"This gun is not good at all! It shoots to the left, barrel arrived bent, no red dot scope came with it(as advertised)."
3,This gun is okay,"This gun is not really a good primary weapon, and is pretty small.But you do get what you paid for. It is only semi-auto and feels reallylight. The laser scope does not come with batteries, and I don't even know which kind it takes. But, if you just want a cool looking, and DOES shoot, get this one. Yes it does come in black, bot that clear dum looking color."
5,A great springed weapon,first of all this is a great company to buy guns from and the gun itself was unbeleivably acurate. The supplies it came with were good and the pellets were 1st class. the fps I would say is around 225-250 depending on pellets you use. I would reccomend this gun to anyone really Its light wont break easily and has great range and accuracy. the shipping only took 3 days and was altogether only 20$ WITH SHIPPING INCLUDED buy this gun
2,Not Adequate,"This book does not tell you what you need to know to get started in fly fishing. Armed only with this book your initial enthusiasm will degrade into frustration. Fly fishing is a very knowledge and technique intensive sport and this book is very spotty here, although an enjoyable read. Try the L.L.Bean Fly-Fishing Handbook or some other book which gives you details on casting, strategies, and techniques and from there you will need to find a knowledgeable friend or guide to progress."
1,Definitely NOT for beginners,"I have been fly fishing for just over a year and decided to pick up this book to get another opinion on choosing flies, on-stream techniques, equipment to make everything a bit easier. Unfortunately, this book did nothing to help. Even the section on tying knots was more hindering than helpful (and I already knew how to tie most of them!). I'm still on the search for a decent book, but let me tell you, it's definitely not this one."
3,Fly Fishing for Dummies not all that great,This book is an OK overview of the sport but there are much better books out there. Fly Fishing (A Trailside Guide) by John Merwin is one. Merwin's book has extrememly colorful pictures that get you excited about fishing and the illustrations make it very easy to learn somewhat complicated knots. Fly Fishing for Dummies doesn't do a horrible job of explaining things but different books I've read do a much better job making it easier to learn and much more enjoyable.
1,not very helpful,"I'm glad I had a basic knowledge of fly fishing before I read this book, or I would have been mislead and confused on many subjects. Some good information, some confusing information, and some incorrect information."
5,Fly Fishing for Dummies,"Very good transaction. Book was as listed, like new, and arrived earlier than I thought it would."
4,great recipies for dogs,My dog loves the oatmeal chews. But I had a hard time getting my cats to eat some of the recipies.
1,Paid too much!,"I bought this book for 99 cents and I have to say I overpaid. It started out extremely slow and then it started to drag even more. I didn't have very high expectations but I was just looking for an evening's quiet entertainment. I didn't like the main characters. I thought the premise was sort of silly. The Heroines efforts to create an invention that to me was not so ground-shaking as they were trying to infer. The 'hero' kept going on and on like a really boring and trite motivational speaker. The romance started to be hot but dragged so much I lost the little interest I had. The ending was totally unbelieveable with the sudden changing of the antagonist, who after less than a hour starts spouting slang and cliches and acting totally out of character.It took me several days to just finish it and I found myself checking frequently so see just how much more I had to go before I was done.I will not be buying any more of these books."
2,not a fan,"I am not a romance person, so I should have known, but I figured I'd give it a try. I'm still not a romance person."
4,Fine,Nothing new to this book plots but it is a nice read for the weekend. It was really good since it was free.
5,A Classic,"This and Elaine Tuttle Hansen's _Chaucer and the Fictions of Gender_ are, I think, the two single best books of Chaucerian criticism out there. This book provides everything you need to know about the CT: the sources and influences of the Canterbury Tales, the themes and issues for each teller and his/her tale, and the dominant interpretations out there. Plus there's the Cooper-type insight into the tales you just come to expect from her work. This one's a classic."
5,Finally a consistent and logical commentary on the Apocalypse,"The author gives a consistent commentary on the literal meaning of Revelation and a good explanation of the spirtual senses (i.e the loving moral view, a faithful analogical/typological view and a hopeful anagogical view.) Particular care for the liturgical elements in the book and their relation with the Divine Liturgy (the Roman Rite Mass) is developed and applied, showing the biblical basis for the New Testament Church's Liturgy.My only criticism of this book is that Mr. Barber sometimes doesn't develope the relationship between some things as strongly as I think the text indicates. For exmaple the releationship between Jerusalem and Rome in Revelation 17 is connected much stronger in my view than in Michael's."
5,Excellent study of the book of Revelation!,"My small group is currently about half-way through this book, and we are all enjoying it very much! Michael Barber does a great job going through what can be a confusing,frightening and often misunderstood book. A great study for either small groups or individuals wanting to learn more about St. John's Revelation."
4,Great Study on the Book of Revelation,"Was taking a course on the Book of Revelation, and found this book a great resource and accessory study guide. The author walks you through each chapter and verse and even provides additional information in every-day terms. Recommend this book highly."
5,Cool!,"It was released back in 1979 while disco craze was at the peak of it's popularity. I miss those days really.'I Just Want To Be' sounds still great to me with it's thumping bass and groove line. 'Sparkle' is a very good example of Cameo's ballad side. Energy, New York and the rest are classic Cameo trademarks. Consequently, I recommend this album to all the die-hard Cameo fans."
5,Great Book!,"This is a wonderful book. Written beautifully and providing a wonderful explanation of how NOW's style of governance affected how it has engaged in politics since its inception. If you are teaching or taking a class on interest groups, social movements, or women and politics, this book will make a great addition. Highly recommended."
1,Poor sound quality,"I returned the phone, which was quite attactive by the way, because it had poor sound quality. Callers heard voices as very muffled and hard to understand. On my end, the sound was OK, a bit harsh on high volume and slightly muffled on the low setting.I tried to overlook this shortcomming, but it is a phone afterall, and performance should take priority."
1,No way are they anti-fog,"These goggles fog up faster than any goggle I have seen. They claim to be anti-fog but MSA must not have tested this feature. It makes me wonder about their other products. The goggles become useless in a matter of seconds due to fog. Otherwise they are a pretty nice google but when you can't see, they are of no value."
5,Easily recommended!,"All of the recordings by Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars are easily recommended to fans of bop and West Coast jazz. This CD reissue is as good as any of their dates, featuring a particularly strong lineup: trumpeter Conte Candoli, either Frank Rosolino or Stu Williamson on trombone, altoist Bud Shank, tenor saxophonist Bob Cooper, pianist Claude Williamson, bassist Rumsey and drummer Stan Levey. With the exception of three Cooper originals, most of the songs hark back to the swing era (including ""Isn't It Romantic,"" ""East of the Sun"" and ""Dickie's Dream""), but the solos and arrangements were modern for 1955. Recommended."
4,great clay book,"Love clay, love mosaics-this is a book that combines both and has beautiful things to make and enjoy. The pictures are beautiful and the instructions are clear."
4,Wow,I loved the concept behind this book- two authors' stories are actually real! Both stories were very good (I normally don't like sci-fi books with cyborg/human hybrids). The only thing I didn't like was how there wasn't a lot a sisterly dialouge between the women when they were reunited.
5,Captive Dreams.... Angela and Diane @ their finest,"I've loved Angela Knight since discovering Secrets books by Red Sage several years ago. It also introduced me to a new author with Ms. Whiteside's tale.And this book is beyond.... yummy. It's got the hot steamy portions, and an amazing tale. Two seriously hot men, and two fiesty, wonderful heroines.I loved it."
3,Captive Dreams,"I loved the way this book started out with the two sisters meeting the heros they had created in their books. The first story, Bound by the Dragon, written by Diane Whiteside, bored me to tears. It was a real struggle to get through it. But, the second story, Bound by the Dream, by Angela Knight, made my earlier struggle well worth it. I just wish Bound by a Dream was the longer of the two stories, and the first one to be read."
1,Oh GAWD! Not again!!,"I have several of Angela Knight's books and really enjoyed them, which is why I bought this bomb. I usually read a romance book in a day or two but I'm still chewing on this one after a week and getting indigestion all the way. The plot!?! There is none beyond the authors being kidnapped and whisked off to fantasy lands for never ending sex. And very boring sex at that. I wouldn't label this book a romance story. It's definitely pointless porn ..... neverending pointless porn. 95% is this so called erotica that is very boring after the first page and 5% very weak effort at storyline. The heros are laughable and the heroines are stupid because they don't take themselves out of this nightmare. I'm sorry I spent my money on this book. I'll be more cautious in the future.I apologize for not giving more of a story outline but I really couldn't find enough to talk about."
2,Poor writing. First better than last.,"I gave this book 2 stars because the first story was somewhat interesting with the 2 sisters, the dragon, the magic and the fantasy part. The second was not much fantasy and the sex scenes were really out there. Machines!! I liked the characters well enough. There weren't many. I skipped a lot in the second book just to get to the plot and end reading this book. I would not recommend this to anyone. There are to many erotica books that are written much better than this one."
3,Couldn't Angela Knight have written both??,"I bought this book because I like Angela Knight. But, I couldn't get over some of the phrasing the author of 'Bound by the Dragon used...'woman's jewel', 'yoni's petals'. AAagh! It drove me nuts. And Angela Knight's contribution to this book is about 1/4 the length of the other author's. Boooooo!!! This book did have a really neat concept & plot line though."
5,captivated!,"This is a really spicy read from two favourite authors - Angela Knight being a star of Secrets and Diane Whiteside featuring at Ellora's Cave...The story centres on two sisters who write fantasy/futuristic best-sellers without realizing their heroes are actually having to live the convoluted plots arising from their twisted imaginations.Both heroes are to die for yummy - Diane's Mykhael being the more obviously a nice guy, with Jarred having a really dark, dark side...The clue (er broad hint) to the theme lies in the ""captive"" part of the title - but the fine characterisation, plotting and basic decency of the two guys are the elements that make this a romantic as well as a racy read. I loved it...& yeah I'm a fan anyway - but I have no hesitation in recommending it to anyone who likes fantasy or futuristic romance - or even just something a little different - if you like your romance with a sizzle then this is for you!"
2,Not the same product!,"I promptly received this business card holder. It looks great, but it's not the same one pictured in the images! I was dissapointed that it is not at all distressed, the stitching is not white (it is in fact, black), and it's a much, much darker brown.It's a cool product, but it's not the product I thought I was purchasing.5 Stars if they had not misrepresented themselves."
3,"Yeah, well, the BeeGees are very good, but come on, I'm 43, not 73.","I care for the BeeGees a big deal and this CD has more sentimental value (although it's before my time), than it has a real musical value. Still, some songs are great, and others just fun to listen to once in a while. Not my current style. CELTIC THUNDER, The Corrs, Lesiem, well, that's just phenomenal stuff."
2,A diamond solitare,"""Massachusetts"" can still make me sentimental. I know the song is actually an anti-flower-power song, but a deeper meaning has been impressed on me. If you've ever been homesick, this song will not cure you, but will go a long way to calming you. ""World"" is more cubic zirconium than diamond. While a staple of live performances (and rightly so - it sparkles brilliantly there), this one needed more polishing to make it attractive."
4,The Second Album - They Breakaway!,"This being the Bee Gees 2nd album, they distanced themselves a bit from the previous heavy orchestration and established themselves more of a rock/pop band. Featuring the #1 UK hit ""Massachusetts"" and the loud, rocking ""World"" (UK only), this set contains everything from plaintive sad ballads to rock and roll standards. Robin's ""And The Sun Will Shine"" is a classic tear-jerker and reputably, recorded on the first take. ""Lemons Never Forget"", ""The Earnest Of Being George"" and ""The Change Is Made"" are fine examples of late sixties rock and roll. The Beatles influenced is heard on ""Birdie Told Me"", a bouncy McCartney-esque tune and ""Day Time Girl"" also falls into this category. ""Really And Sincerely"" is a tad too melancholy and ""Harry Braff"" is simply annoying. However, the album succeeds in the end and finishes with ""Horizontal"", a brilliantly simple song with the piano chords reading - literally - horizontally."
4,Sinbad Afros and Bellbottoms,"I was very excited to get this DVD. I have the VHS tape and my player died. The clarity is great and as usual Sinbad is hilarious. The only drawback is the editing. Some of the funniest parts were cut. A suggestion to the companies in the future, please put everything on the DVD, that is what the consumer is paying for."
4,Not the same as VHS,"This is a GREAT performance but I also own the VHS tape and for some reason there are at least 2 missing segments from the DVD performance that were on the VHS version, very disappointing since those segments were equally as funny as the rest of this DVD."
5,Must Have,"We have watched this DVD over and over again. This was especially helpful when our son was a teenager, it kept us laughing. Sinbad delivers wisdom and wit like no one else."
4,Funny Without Being Dirty,I laughed so hard at some points I thought I was going to pee my pants. Sinbad really has a handle on society and it's issues. The references to Rodney King are a little dated but the stuff he does about the difference between growing up in the 70's and growing up in the 90's was hilarious!!! I have already watched this a least 3 times and it still is funny!!!
4,"Sinbad is hilarious, why edit it?","This is one of the first stand up comedies I ever saw and it is hilarious. I was very upset that some of the funniest parts were edited out. Had I known, I would have tried to find a copy that included everything."
4,does it again,"Sinbad, what can I say.Well he is one of the greatest comics in the world. I think that sums it up. I dont think this is his best performance but it is definitly funny. I'll watch it many times."
5,family fun!,"The thing I love about Sinbad is that he can make you laugh so hard your side hurts, but he never swears. To me, that is the sign of a great comedian. This is a great DVD. He brings back memories of the 70's on this one. But his humor is so universal, that all ages can relate, and enjoy his performance."
3,Disappointed with edits,Sinbad is my favorite stand-up comedian. I remember seeing his HBO special Afros & Bellbottoms a few years ago and I truly enjoyed it. I'm happy to see this is now available on DVD. I'm very disappointed that some of the funniest portions have been edited out! Since receiving this DVD I've been searching for the VHS version that I'm told contains the full uneditied program. Does anyone know where the VHS version can be purchased?It's great having a stand-up comedian that's so funny and entertaining without the use of profanity. Keep up the good work Sinbad!
4,good stand up,"I love Sinbad's comedy. This DVD was very good, but somehow didn't have some of his funniest stuff that I can remember from a few years ago. He is so upbeat and funny and I enjoy his style no matter what. Enjoyable show and DVD."
5,"Loved it, loved it, loved it!","I've seen it several times and I laugh just as hard as the last time I saw it. It's great family fun...especially for those of us that grew up in the '70s. Our kids love it. Its a great film to watch when you have a group sitting around cutting up and visiting with each other. You can just pick up on any one of his monologues and have fun. I wish they would re-release it because the videos stores around here don't carry it! I need one! Its just great to see that a comedian understands they can be creative and funny without the vulgarity some feel they have to go to. Good clean fun for everyone. Keep up the good work, Sinbad."
4,lost it and found it,I lost this video and found it again on Amazon. So funny! I would suggest reading it especially if you are from the 70's or not.
5,Sinbad at his best,"This was Sinbad at his best, he kept the laughs coming as he talked about everything from silly 70s to the nutty 90s. It had me laghing from start to finish."
5,Left me in stitches!!,"Sinbad is absolutely hysterically funny without being foul or vulgar. Not one swear word or inappropriate innuendo, totally family friendly, but so darned FUNNY that this left me in stitches. Excellent video to show at a party, family get together or just with friends hanging out. Every DVD of his has hilarious insights into parenting, being a teenager and male-female relations, but with not one repeat of material. This guy sees into the humor of the dymamics with a fresh perspective every time and leaves you saying, ""Yep, I've done that!"" while rolling on the floor cracking up. A must purchase if you like to laugh!!!"
3,"Satisfied, but not quite as satified.","I had an original HBO VHS of this stand up and it was awesome, but I lost it somehow so I wanted to buy another one. The only complaint I have is the fact that this DVD is edited. Certain subjects that Sinbad talked about in the original copy he doesn't even bring up in this one. I checked to see if maybe it was another city or another night of his stand up, but it was all the same people from the original one. So I guess I am about 90% satisfied with this purchase. Great quality though, I will buy from Amazon again."
2,Disappointed,This was not the entire version of the HBO Special. I was disappointed because some of my favorite parts were missing from this DVD. If I had known it wasn't the entire show I wouldn't have bought it.
5,Has been a staple at our home for the past 2years!,"I got this for my daughter when she was a baby and she still loves it, at 2! The story is sweet and comforting, just what young kids love. Little Sam is put to bed by his mom, but he indicates there's something mom is forgetting ['I'm waiting']...and of course, it all ends well, with lots of hugs and kisses ['again!', 'again!']. The illustrations are beautiful with lush colors. A definite keeper!"
5,Bedtime treat!,"A lovely bedtime story, my 8month old loves it!Initially I thought It might be too wordy for him, but with its beautiful words and contrasting colors its a true bedtime treat."
5,TEN TIMES A DAY!,My 2-year old can't get enough. We have read this wonderful book ten times a day since Christmas and she carries it everywhere. The sounds of the wind and the rain are wonderful and the pictures are absolutely gorgeous! A definite must have for the pre-school bookshelf.
5,One to Snuggle By.,"Really a wonderful celebration of the mother-child bond. The deep, swirling illustrations of the storm outside contrast the warmth inside little bear's bedroom. My 2-year-old requests to ""sit closer"" for extra cuddles as the story progresses to little bear's favorite part of the bedtime ritual, his good-night kisses. Sharing books like this with my son is a joy of parenting."
2,Run-on sentences,"I can't stand it that this book doesn't follow the rules of grammar. It includes run-on sentences. It's also written in an odd way, with a bad cadence and scattered word choice."
5,A True Snuggle-Up Bedtime Story,"What a charming book! This book arrived on my doorstep when I failed to return a book-of-the-month club refusal card. Am I ever glad I didn't turn this one down! My three-year-old son and I absolutely love this adorable story of nightly bedtime rituals. He relates to it so well, and loves to mimick the way the wind blows through the trees on the dark and stormy night on Plum Street....whooo, whooooo. I don't think we ever outgrow these heartwarming stories of the love shared between parents and their children. And I haven't even mentioned the beautiful illustrations! This book will really tug at your heart. First class, all the way."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered a child's book thinking it was the chunky, cardboard kind for little ones. But it was, instead, a flimsy paperback not at all suitable for a baby. With the price of the book plus shipping - not at all worth it!"
3,A mixed up book,"The story in itself is very good, with excellent acrylic paintings to illustrate it. The trouble comes with the writing: there are times when the choice of words makes the reader stumble ( the fragment 'the blanket that was red' just gets stuck in the middle of a couple sentences, making it awkward). I wondered if English was the author's native language.The illustrations, although brilliant, don't always match up the story: for instance, scenes alternate between being rainy and not rainy... even though it's been raining on the windows and the roof, it's dry on the ground and trees.My daughter likes it, but I don't know if she'd like reading it to her daughter when she grows up."
5,Grandson loves Sam!!!,"Kiss Good Night (Sam Books)As my grandson started wanting to be read to before bedtime. I found this book. He fell in love with Sam and has picked up the phrase"" I'm waiting"" when he wants a good night kiss. Also, Now all teddy bears are named Sam. I've told him he has to have his mommy take him to Sam's House now that he's started asking to go visit Sam & grandma is old and forgotten the way. He loves the book. He wants to play with sam."
4,Good bedtime storybook,My kids really enjoy this book and it makes it easier for putting them down for the night after reading it. Great for any parent that works full time and needs a easier time getting the little ones down for the night.
5,wonderful book for children,"Gave this book to my grandkids for Christmas. Two and 6 months. The two year old loved the book right away, and was excited to have a new book for bedtime reading. The 6 month old, just looked at the pictures, but never took his eyes off the pages. I highly suggest this book for children, and for the adults who will be reading it, very nice."
2,Skims the Major Issues,"I found ""How to Keep Being a Parent When Your Child Stops Being a Child"" to be minimally beneficial. It skims the major issues while teaching parents basic skills. I feel that if a parent is looking for help raising adolescents this book will not give them enough information and advice to be helpful."
2,A very average sampler of pop-reggae,"This is an ok sampler of some good reggae, but if you are interested in reggae I strongly encourage you to check out individual artists such as Jimmy Cliff, Peter Tosh and of course Bob Marley."
4,Hard to close but great!,"These cups seem to be a good standard size and fit well on an easel I got for my kids at a local craft store. A couple of the lids are hard to get snapped on, but once they are on you don't have to worry about them coming off. I love that you can leave paint in the cup and then snap the seperate covering over the whole lid area when you are done. This means my kids paint more often because I don't have to take the time to refill cups and wash up after every masterpiece. The down side is that there are not brushes to go with the cups. In retrospect I think I might have gotten a set with fewer cups (10 won't fit on your easel tray anyway) that had brushes to go with the cups. I've found that the most affordable tempra paints seem to be in primary colors, so a set of 5 cups and brushes would have done the trick for me."
3,"Very hard to see, but like the puzzles","Even with the backlight turned on, the screen is very hard to see. The letters are very small, too. I am very nearsighted and need to bring the unit nearly up to my nose. The puzzles are challenging, though."
3,Disappointing,"Kind of disappointing! This order seemed to be older then my last and were softer and more grandular looking instead of that clear caramel color. Had to ditch half of them because I wasn't sure of the safety, the rest were OK.I will try again from this selleror another."
5,If Just For One Song...,"I really love listening to this album. All the songs are good, but ""Oleo"" is really a stand-out. Dolphy really soars and plays his heart out and the rhthym section is really movin'.Really listen to the drumming; it's magnificent especially at the beginning of the piano solo. My only complaint is that the bass seems a little far down in the mix.This album is really worth it just to be able to listen to ""Oleo"""
3,Not for novices!,"I bought this book, like the title says, to teach myself everything I needed to know about Microsoft Windows XP in 21 days. As a novice, I quickly discovered that it would take me quite a bit longer to grasp most of the concepts in this book, because a certain level of understanding, especially vocabulary, is assumed by the author. I simply didn't understand most of it. It is probably a good book for advanced users, but with my limited knowledge of computers, I really could not say. In fact, since it is too advanced for me, I am going to give the book to a computer expert as a gift. The book is 746 pages long and has complete chapters about subjects which I have never heard of. The author himself says that this book is for intermediate and advanced users. I would recommend going to a book store to really check out a computer reference book this this before ordering it online. That might save you some disappointment and money!"
2,Not Quite All Unfortunately,"The product seemed fine, but it did not actually fit my RV. I have 2013 Airstream, and it may not fit any Airstream (my guess is that it would not). If you do not have a track in your awning, this will not fit. I know many RV's do, but you will probably need to get clip on ""S"" hooks if you want to hang things from an Airstream like awning system."
4,Work good,"The party light holders work good, but the silver S hooks constantly fall out of the gray holders when I try and put the string of lights through them. That part is kind of annoying, but once the lights are up, no problems, even on windy days. Easy to use and seem pretty durable."
1,Please give us a sample of Simenon's writing.,"All of the Kindle samples of Simenon's work waste space on an introduction. Thisresults in little if any sample of the actual work by Simenon. In the sample of ""The Widow"",there is not one word written by Simenon.Please correct this defect in your samples."
4,Good Design Source,"I have used this book numerous times for the somewhat non-traditional purpose of tattoo designs. My complaint is minor, and it has to do with how the book is formatted. The designs are white on a red or black background. This makes it a little difficult to photocopy for use; especially on the red pages."
1,It's NOT Drunken Master 2 (1994). It's Drunken Master (1979),"Don't buy that. The quality is the worse I've ever seen for a DVD. There is no features and the pictures on the package are from Drunken Master 2 and on the disk itself, there is a picture from the Drunken Master 2 poster and we can even read Drunken Master II in chinese. But it is not Drunken Master 2. Drunken Master 1 is very bad besides Drunken Master 2 and they are trying to sell us a bad movie by making us believed that it is another movie. Dishonest."
3,No Jackie,"Jackie Chan is not in this film... This is 'The Story Of The Drunken Master' reprinted. Saying that it's still pretty good with old rubber legs himself Casanova Wong, old master Simon Yuen and an incredibly flexible Sharon Yeung (Pan Pan) with Yen Shi-Kwan as the bad guy. The opening scene features Jackie Chan demonstrating Drunken Boxing and thats what gets him on the cover."
2,NOT A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE,"Jackie is only in a brief clip in the beginning, stolen from the REAL Drunken Master. This clip is entirely unrelated to the movie, and is very short. Buy this if you want, but not because you think it has Jackie in it."
1,Defective release,"Yes, the movie is great,But the original score is defective:chinese and english alternate through themovie. purists beware!"
1,THIS ISNT WHAT YOU THINK!,"This is NOT Legend of Drunken Master, as the reviews imply. This is the much older Drunken Master 1, as the blurb on the box lets you know, once you have purchased it. It's not anywhere near the quality, either technically or as a movie, of Legend. Someone has dropped the ball!"
1,Drunken Master I or II?,"Before I buy this one, can anybody guarantee that this is the new Drunken Master we are talking about here? If this is the new one, the title has surely made some confusion."
5,Drunken Master,I am a little biased because I am a huge Jackie Chan fan. I especially love his movies made in his homeland and away from Hollywood.This ranks up there as one of the best.
1,Disappointed & Misleading Photo on DVD,"I have never felt the need to write a review until now... I loved Jackie Chan in most of his newer movies. I loved ""Drunken Master"", so decided to purchase the DVD. In reviewing all the similar titles which came up on the Amazon search, I chose the one with the cover photo that resembled the movie. What a total disappointment when I began to watch it!It was NOT the movie I expected. Many of us do NOT know that Jackie Chan made several versions of this same movie and title. If this is the OLD first version of his movie, why is he using a recent photo?After more careful investigation it seems that I actally wanted the ""Legend of Drunken Master"", but the photo on the cover is of a very young Jackie Chan. Because I was fooled before, I am now very hesitant on purchasing any of Jackie Chan's DVD."
3,"Good movie, bad audio/video.","I'll keep this short - if you're a real Jackie Chan fan this movie is a must have, if you're not this one is safe to skip. Be aware that the audio and video on this DVD is terrible."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!,"This movie is a fraud! I own almost every Jackie Chan movie and this is NOT a real Jackie Chan movie...it is a fake! He is not in it, and I'm sure he has not allowed this movie to be released, especially using his name because HE IS NOT IN IT! There are a few short clips of Drunken Master spliced into it, but nothing else! I am getting my money back ASAP. This is the first and last time I will ever be swindled."
1,They're right! It's the WRONG MOVIE!!,"The others are right. This is NOT Drunken Master II, which was recently in the theaters. This is Drunken Master I, the first one, which has already been out on DVD ... but not with quality this bad.This is a complete waste of money. Do not buy this DVD. I mean it. The quality of a VHS tape is better than this hunk of garbage."
4,"Great Release, but with a few problems...","Finally, one of Jackie's best movies comes to DVD in the US. This version is supposedly uncut but I really cant say since I saw it for the first time quite a while ago and I can't remember. Picture quality is great for a film of its age, especially an HK film (many old HK films are very poor quality because of bad storage conditions) and the sound is about as good as it could be. As has been stated here before, the Cantonese audio track sometimes switches back to english for a few lines which is quite annoying. But seriously, 5 minutes of English dialogue doesnt ruin the whole movie.Overall, I'd say that this is a pretty high quality DVD release except for the audio problem and the lack of any real extras (aside from the awesome full length commentary by Ric Meyers and Jeff Yang). However, for the best version of this movie on DVD check out the Hong Kong Legends version or wait for their 2-disc Platinum release(!)"
4,"Great, except for the audio problem","This is a really good DVD. Great picture for its age, great movie, great commentary by Ric Meyers. However, the audio problem that everyone is running into with the Cantonese track is supposedly due to the bad audio master that the company got the material from. Apparently, some of the audio was in such poor shape that they couldn't leave it on and instead replaced it in all these weird places with the English dub track. That's what I read from one reviewer website at least. Take that info or leave it. But still worth having."
3,What's up?,"I just bought this great movie and was very disappointed with the audio. No matter how I set it up, the spoken language goes from chinese to english and back again, I thought I got a bad copy and returned it. Guess what? Same problem!! Is anyone else experiencing this? I just bought a new DVD player(Sony), so I know it's not my player."
3,Not 'AKA Drunken Master 2',"Even the pictures on the DVD case are from Drunken Master 2/Legend of the Drunken Master. The quality (audio and visual) is exactly what you would expect from a film made in Hong Kong in 1979 ... not great. I think that the movie I saw, which was not the movie that I thought that I was ordering, was entertaining, funny, good Jackie Chan. DM2 though is more, well ... a movie that was made better (as in script, acting, non-dubbed), in my opinion. Be sure that you are getting what you want."
4,Probably the best Jackie Chan film out there,"Drunken Master starts the Kung-Fu comedy Genre and although the story is lighthearted in nature, the athletic work every character displays still holds strong almost twenty years later.Jackie Chan shows the world how big a star he will become in this Yuen Woo Ping masterpiece. The drunken style he dispalys in this classic will make you laugh even though your jaw has dropped to the floor. The training sequences he goes through are vigorous and gut-wrenching which many films later try to impersonate but fail to do so.Seriously, if you like Jackie or old Martial Arts Films, i shouldn't have to tell you to go buy this, the movie is great and the DVD quality is even better.P.S.The audio commentary is probably the best i have heard on any DVD. They break down the film to a comlete science and after listening you will only have more respect for Jackie."
4,Karate Classic,"I love this movie, I know it inspired alot of kung fu movie. Jackie Chan makes everything look so easy. It's entertaining and the whole family can watch it. He not bruce lee but he doesn't have to be, he's jackie chan, he has his own style dammit lol"
3,Must for any Jackie fans.,"This was one of Jackies early movies but the DVD has been remastered to crystal clear quality. However beware, the audio dubbing has been also re-done and this really takes away the original charm of the movie.Some of the famous lines said in the original has been replaced by insipid dialogues in the remastered version. I would rate this movie as one of Jackies best, but to keep in your collection, please go buy the original VHS, or chinese released DVD, with the original dialogues.Also in the DVD, the chinese sub-titles keep coming on and going off. No matter what i try, and in any player, the subtitles keep appearing and disappearing at regular intervals."
3,Don't tamper with a classic!,"This version has been tampered with,much to my disappointment. It's still worth buying though.I watched this film back to back with the Wu Tang Clan's release of Kung Fu of the 8 Drunkards,which has tons of extras and dynamite fight scenes.I also suggest getting the Wu' release of Shaolin Drunkard,which was directed by Yuen Woo Ping also."
2,Jackie Chan's Drunken Master ?????????????,"This movie is not Jackie Chan's Drunken Master. Jackie is in it for about 5 minutes total. They have dubbed scenes from Drunken Master and put them in this movie. There is a good fight scene at the end of the movie, but Jackie Chan is not in it. This is a cheap imitation of the real thing. It is not a bad movie over all, but not a Jackie Chan movie."
1,Worst transfer to dvd ever,"yes its a kung fu classic and Jackie Chan's personal favorite movie, but the video and audio quality are unwatchable, seek out the remastered edition and skip this one."
2,NOT THE RECENTLY RELEASED MOVIE,This is the orginal Drunken Master. While it is a great movie this is a horrible DVD. It looks like it was transfered from a VHS tape and there are NO extra features.. there isn't even a root menu. Just a dub of a tape to dvd..be warned
5,I just love this movie,"In spite of the fact that this movie is now about 25 years old, it is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies. I love Jackie Chan and I can't really get enough of watching drunken boxing kung fu style - there are many other styles beautiful to watch, but this one I find the most entertaining. The Legend of the Drunken Master has more wild action, but I prefer the original Drunken Master. I also very much appreciate the kung fu training segments - makes you want to follow along and train along with Jackie."
1,"Amusing Hong-Kong action, but no Jackie Chan","This video has some amusing low-budget B-grade Hong-Kong action, but don't confuse it with a Jackie Chan movie. There is a clip of about five minutes of Chan lifted from another movie, and Jackie Chan is NOT a character in this movie. (Don't confuse it with ""Drunken Master!!)"
1,It is but it isn't the same movie!,"Well, you would have to imagine how excited I was to hear Drunken Master (The real version) was coming out on DVD. I pre-ordered it to ensure my copy, it was delived...what movie is this the dialog is totally different. Those devotees of the genre and this movie in particular are familiar with the famous line Jackie gives Thunderfoot at their second meeting ""Each man, 1 way; Each horse, 1 stance; Each church, 1 buddha; Each master to his own technique"" and the music return is CLASSIC and nothing less. In this digitally remade, remastered pseudo Drunken Master that classic line is reduced to ""So you think that you're the only master here, well let me tell you, my drunk gods don't mess around nobody can fight like they do"" HUH? I was appalled! Remember Sam Seed, the name of the old drunk master his name is changed to So high(phonetic) leave it in the store don't tarnish the memory!"
3,Acton Packed,This movie was bought for my husband as a gift and I was very surprised with how much action it had in it. It was enjoyable. It is older than some of Jackie's others but was still good.
3,Drunken Master 2 ?,"I bought this movie because of the hype surrounding Drunken Master 2. I really wanted to see the final fight scene. It really sucks that this is a completly different movie than it says on the top. This is ""Drunken Master"" made in 1979, not ""Drunken Master 2"" made in 1994 or ""The Legend of Drunken Master"" re-realeased in 2000. Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie for 1979. The worst part of the whole movie is the abysmal audio-video in the DVD. It looks and sounds like they recorded over a low quaulity VHS tape 50 times and then converted it to a DVD. The only reason that this video got 3 stars was because of the cool fight scenes. (I also hate Jackie Chan's skeaky dub-voice, but it's ok)"
5,No It isnt Legend of the drunken master,Ok i first want to start by saying i have no ideal why anyone would think this is drunken master 2 second i feel this movie is better any how i mean dont get me wrong DM2 has better camera shots and better dubbing but thats not what were here to see are we Drunken Master is filled with great fighting scenes not as good as the one that took place about half way threw DM2 but like i said it is filled with good fight scenes and thats why we watch now isnt it DM2 has like 4 good fights and 1 is cut short due to jackies stepmom. In my oppion both movies deserve 5 stars but Drunken Master is a better story plus it has Sam Seed in it
2,I know you have to take the dialog and acting......,".....with a grain of salt but, except for the amazing final fight scene and the hilarious Drunken Master himself, this movie was un-funny and almost unwatchable at times. Too bad, because we loved Chan's second Drunken Master movie but this one left us very disappointed."
3,OK,These came packed very nice. They looked great. They look OEM and fit OEM. The only issue is that after about a month the shine fads pretty bad and they get dull looking.
5,Lesbians are the greatest people,"I agree so much man. You rule dude. Lesbians are great. I wondered what you were talking aboot at first, but then I realized how great lesbians are."
5,Remember the simple joys of childhood,"I fell in love with this book when my three-year-old brought it home from the public library. While it seems to be geared to a slightly older age group (4-6 maybe), she loves it, too, because it describes things that happen in a small child's day that are insignificant to us, but very significant to them. From finding shoes and catching bugs to taking a bath and going to sleep at night, the child (in this case a boy) is just small/quick/calm/etc. enough to do the things he wants to do all by himself. Written in such a way that makes parents see life again from a child's point of view and reminds us to recognize those simple everyday accomplishments of our growing children. I love it."
5,A fun read,We also discovered this great book at the library. The catchy rhymes are so much fun that my 2-1/2 yr old even remembers bits of them & repeats them throughout the day. A book I don't mind reading to him over & over again.
2,Too elementary,"The publisher has another book, same price, also about 270 pages, also written by a woman investor, only it's much better and more detailed than this book. ""A Beginner's Guide To Day Trading Online"" by Toni Turner is a much better buy."
4,The Mamas and Papas Live at Monterey,"Unfortunately this is the only ""live"" recording of the original line-up that currently exists. Although this is the group's worst live performance (John and Michelle have admitted this in their autobiographies) there are some stand-out performances, most especially ""I Call Your Name"", which showcases the true vocal talents of Mama Cass Elliot. The group also inflects some beautifully inspired harmony on ""Got a Feelin'"". With the exception of the festival finale, ""Dancing in the Streets"", all of the live recordings on this CD are songs that originate from their first album - their outstanding classic, ""If You Can Believe Your Eyes and Ears"". This CD should be a part of any true fan's collection but it left me wishing that there was another live recording of the band, perhaps from their concerts at Carnegie Hall or the Hollywood Bowl."
4,Mamas & Papas Live - Our Only Option,"This was admittedly not their finest performance (according to the group members in various interviews), but it is the only full concert set that's available to us. So if you love the music of the Mamas and the Papas, this is well worth the twelve bucks. Actually, it's not bad, and there is some live dialogue, too."
3,An embarrassment for such legends....,"Everything has already been written in review here about this album. My only question from the first time I bought the vinyl back in 1969 was ""where did they dig up these musicians who obviously had never heard a Mamas and Papas song?"" If I was the bass player I would have put my hands on a railroad track, hopefully to never be able to play again. I don't think he correctly played more than three consecutive notes in a row for the entire set. It's so bad, that as an amateur bassist myself, I just can't listen to this anymore. I would give the singers a B+ and the band an F, except for the bass player; F-. Yuck."
4,Very nice looking portfolio,"The cover is VERY nice... and the ""pages"" are as advertised, exceptionally clear. However it isn't perfect.1. The first print holding page was not sealed on the far right edge properly. It was split, so I had to cut that page out. This is a common problem with other Itoya fixed portfolio albums (I also have the 8.5 x 11 which had the same problem). I think Itoya has a quality control problem with their Polyglass pages.2. You cannot add pages to this.3. If you fill this album up with the advertised 48 prints, the portfolio bulges in the spine area. This is true with ALL their portfolio ""books""If you like the ability to add to or change pages within a portfolio, I recommend you get the Itoya binder, where you can add, remove or change pages very easily. Even so, I would recommend this to a friend, with the above caveats."
3,Misleading,"Overall, not a bad set of cards. However, at the time these were produced Warner was promoting some schlock film with Batman in it and neglected to include him in this set. The ad-copy for this is, therefore, deceiving."
5,Stofen Gold Color Bounce Diffuser for Nikon SB-600,I love the ambiance of the flash with this diffuser and wish that there was one available for my SB-700.
5,Cute and Fun,"I wanted to buy this puzzle as a gift for a friend of mine who is not really a big fan of puzzles. This one, however, turned out to be a big hit.The tiles are made from a heavy cardboard, so the pieces feel durable. Since there are only 9 tiles, it is very portable. My friend loves cats, and had a fun time trying to put it together with her family."
3,"Great Fantasy Young Adult, but mediocre for Jones","A young boy, Cat, must deal with his crazy and selfish older sister Gwendolyn who is obsessed with her own magical powers. Certainly much slower and less exciting than Jones' Howl books (read: more for children), but still has her enchanting and seemingly effortless style that captures a world where ""magic is like music"". Jones is always a good read. The characters are mysterious and thoroughly enjoyable. Gwendolyn is ambiguous and silly and selfish and delightful. Cat is an innocent; Chestomanci is Jones' typical ambiguous and passive wizard. The imagery of magic, particularly Cat's matchstick nine lives, is absolutely delicious. Grade: B"
2,OKay,"I guess I should be more ""lenient"" with this book. It is a kids' book afterall. But having read her newer book, dark lord of derkholm, this book was a major disappointment. Dark lord was the first diana w. jones book i've ever read and i liked it so much i went to the library to pick out more of her books. How old were cat and gwen anyway? was it ever mentioned or did i miss it? and I didn't like the fact that diana let the evil Gwen get away so easily. Do evil and get away with it. She became a queen too, in her own world! I borrowed two other DWJ books, let's hope they are much better than this one."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Charmed Life is about some kids who go to study magic with one of the official guys in charge of magic. He has a couple of kids of his own, and they are the usual school age to have the school age disagreements and fights and not being nice to each other that goes along with that.The eldest also gets a bit peeved at being thrown in with the young brats, too."
4,Absolutely Charming,"Absolutely charming and delightful. I imagine this book to be something akin to if Roald Dahl had written a Harry Potter type book for teens. The old English made me laugh. Reminiscent of James and the Giant Peach/ Willy Wonka, but having to do with witches, enchantors, all sorts of magic, spells, and of course, family. This book was full of family-fun adventure; nothing too dark or violent. Pure magic."
5,This is one of those remarkable books that I can't put down!,"I'm known to read a lot, but this book is incredible! It's humorous, has a good plot, and it makes you want to learn more. At times it's a little confusing, but if you read back, you'll get it. Just read this book carefully, and you'll never put it down!"
5,his greatest jazz album,It is one of the first jazz albums I ever bought and I never stopped loving it.His sound is so natural and swinging that it never stopped amasing me.I bought it again in 1978 at the North Sea Jazz Festival because the first was too old. I am excited to be able to buy it al last on CD. one of his very best albums
1,The WORST publication effort I've ever seen!,As a collector this book was a horrible disappointment. Instead of photo-reproducing Wakefield's translation they apparently attempted to OCR the text. The text is a total mess. Besides an enormous amount of misprints there are 'weird' section headings that have little rhyme or reason. The book is near useless. You'd be much better off using the Google books website or printing it off that sight yourself. Wakefield's beautiful notes in the back are ruined and the Greek readings end up as misprinted garbled messes with English characters that in no way represent the Greek. It is beyond me as to why they would've even attempted such a piece of trash. A blind man could've typed a better job. There are warnings on the internet about this company[..] I wish I'd seen before ordering. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PUBLISHER!
2,Songs From Hungary & Romania,"Nice songs but it's not true that these songs are Romanian or Hungarian. On this CD you can find only gipsy songs (or RROM songs) and the clue is right before your eyes, on the CD cover which shows a gorgeous gipsy woman. I've browsed through all ""Romanian"" CD-s and the only one who has indeed Romanian music is ""Folksongs From Rumania"" by Zamfir. But not ""Rumania"", it should be ""Romania""."
5,Great Lead at a Great price,"I bought this leash to replace my last Flexi leash that I had for several years. The reason I had to replace it was because I left it tied around a tree in the front yard while I was gardening and my free spirited dog chewed his way free! My dog is pretty strong (for a 25 lb dog) and isn't good at walking by your side. So this is great for when you want to keep your dog close.. When I first bought this lead at a local pet store, I paid about double this price. So amazon pricing is just right! (not always the case!)"
2,Slow retraction,"The retraction on the leash is a little slow now, and we've only had it a few months. I'm hoping it doesn't completely give out for a long time, but we'll have to wait and see."
2,Poor Leash,I had problems with this leash. There is not enough tension and it droops at times. Was difficult to pull my dog in closer to me. This is the first time I have ever reviewed something but I was so unhappy with the product.
1,Flexi USED to be the best retractable leash around,"Yes, it USED to be the best, but no longer. I am sorry to say that I had to return the first one because it was hanging up at the end, causing my small dog to trip over the leash on occasion. Now the replacement is doing the exact same thing after a little over a month, and it is too late to return it to Amazon. This has been the leash I have used for about 10 years, having owned two in that decade. So, I had two that worked GREAT for over a decade, and now I have had two over a two month period which hang up...hummmm, I wonder if Flexi is cutting back on their quality? Yes, I think they are. My dog is old and trips a lot anyway, so it really bugs me that this is causing him even more anguish. This is a medium sized leash, supposed to be good for a dog up to 44 pounds. My dog weighs all of 18 pounds, so his weight is not the problem. I hate when companies drop their standards."
3,Oriental,"As a summary this is a typical example of Middle Eastern music, the ones who want to get the smell of Oriental music they have to get this... Follow RA"
2,toy puzzle,Crappy toy and would never buy it again. Do not recommend to anyone. Why I have to go on about this toy is beyond me.
3,Tinker to Evers to ????????,"In my personal opinion, an album should have three tracks that really grab the listener in order to make it worth the cost. This one has two. ""I've Gotta Get A Message to You"" - a song about a man repenting just before being executed in the electric chair (how's that for a song basis?!!!) is the first to make the listener sit up & take notice. The second one is ""I Started A Joke."" Robin's quaver is heart-rending. I really feel for the guy. He sounds like he's ready to die from a broken heart. If you're looking for a 3rd reason to get this album, buy it for the cover. There is a great composite of all five (yes, five) members of the group."
4,Another Stellar Collection from Rebound Records.,"Budget-line subsidiary Rebound Records has made quite the name for itself with its specialty-priced '80s compilations. Usually, the tracks are obscure favorites, or decade standouts. This release is no exception. The 12"" version of ""Tainted Love"" is a knockout, as is nearly every track, except for the Joe Jackson and Squeeze contributions. Not to worry; with tracks like ABC's ""Be Near Me,"" Bananarama's ""Robert DeNiro's Waiting,"" Tears For Fears' ""Change,"" the Buggles' ""Video Killed the Radio Star,"" and the Go-Gos' ""Our Lips Are Sealed,"" you will find yourself extremely satisfied with this delightful disc. (And, hey, it's easy on the ears AND the pockets.)"
2,Not the BEST recording available,"This particular CD is not the best recording of this seminal album that Amazon has available. If you're willing to spring for a few extra bucks then please check out the 2005 mastering by Lonehill:Complete Recordings With Clifford Brown.To my ear the later re-issue is clearly superior. See for yourself by listening back and forth to Amazon's samples for ""Jim"" on each of the recordings. Pay particular attention to Jimmy Jones on the ivories in the background. The piano on the 2000 CD sounds ""tinny"" in comparison."
4,An must for your jazz collection,"If you want one album that shows the young Sarah Vaughn at her best, this would be definitely be it. Couple that with Clifford Brown and you have an album you cannot do without. They are both top notch from beginning to end.The only reason I couldn't dish out that fifth star is simply that I cannot stand Herbie Mann and his distracting tootling. I don't like jazz flute much in the first place, and Mann's performance on this album is hardly calculated to convert anyone. There are a few tracks where his presence comes close to derailing the whole song, but fortunately the rest of the ensemble is able to keep the musical energy flowing.Aside from Herbie, how can one not love this album? It shows why jazz fans consider Sarah Vaughn to be one of the immortals; it also shows what a tragic loss Clifford Brown's premature death was for the music world."
5,Unique and entertaining...,"Michael T. Scott is a refreshing comedian...his sketches are solid and witty, and he doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks.Pre-Chewed Appetizers, his debut cd as far as I know, shows off his wide range of vocal talents...he's wonderful with accents, characters, and impressions. There are quite a few characters (all in a restaurant setting), and each one is distinct; he doesn't let them mesh into one another as many other comedians accidentally tend to do.Not only does this cd exhibit Scott's voice talents, but his writing skills as well. Each sketch is uniquely humorous without being obvious- a lot of the jokes are indirect. One might wonder how Scott would fare writing for a comedic variety show, because he seems to have a knack for creating dynamic characters within a brief sketch while not overusing the punchline.Pre-Chewed Appetizers is an excellent debut, and I personally will be paying attention to Scott's future releases. Highly recommended for all fans of comedy."
1,Where On the Ad Does It Mention that these are Reprints?,It's McSweeneys and to some extent it's what I would expect: a mix of very good and interesting (and occasionally not) pieces of writing. I have heard that the earliest volumes were more uneven than the later. But my problem is not with the writing but that fact that these are reprints and nowhere in the advertisement for these did I see that mentioned (clearly or otherwise) so I bought two.I love my McSweeneys but I don't love how Amazon have advertised this particular set of mags. As soon as I have the time to work out how to get a refund I intend to pursue one.
5,Wonderful for shining some light onto the World Of Darkness!,"This sourcebook is definately a useful tool for any Vampire Storyteller. While it doesn't give the stats for the Antedeluvians, it does give us the character stats for the most famous vampire in all of history. That's right, the (deservingly) dreaded Count Dracula."
1,Teeny Tiny Sound,"I wanted to use these with my MP3 cell phone thinking they would substantially be better than the phone's built-in speakers. Were they better? Well, my 1 star rating answers that question. If you want to know just how loud these speakers get, plug in a regular headphone to your MP3 player, crank the volume all the way up, then set it on the table in front of you."
2,"subpar sound quality, but very portable","The sound's really disappointing, and you need to have your music player on full blast to hear your music at a decent volume, but it really is small and portable, as advertised."
3,Fine for the price.,"These speakers worked fine and I put them through the paces; bathroom, travel, etc. The sound was decent but they eventually wore out. What do you want for that price?"
1,Completely pointless!,"Worst crap we ever bought, we are throwing them out. The sound coming from the speakers is almost not audible, our laptops and ipods have better sound. As you cannot adjust the speakers' volume they are pointless!"
1,Worst Ever Product i purchased,Sound Quality Very Bad and Not able to Hear AnythingNot Worth for Money
2,Not as Marked,"I bought this for Track #5, ""Somethin' Else Again"" which was the opening track of his first album way back when and I was very disgusted when track #5 WAS something else. This is not a great collection and the recording of the tunes toward the albums' end is terrible. Not a good recording of an otherwise fine artist! I'd like to see a real remake of Rickie Havens' first album, ""Somethin' Else Again""."
2,Take it with a grain of salt,"However extensive is the list of Jewish surnames in this book, the interpretation of these names by the author should be always taken with a grain of salt. A.Beider often takes the first plausible explanation of the name without checking it against available historical records or even common sense."
5,Automatic case feeder,This system works better than any I have used in the past. It saves me a lot of time when reloading.
4,Great music. Sound quality is fine.,"Contrary to the previous review, the sound quality is overall fine. A couple of songs have a little fuzz. There are 41 good ska songs here. My favorites : Nimblefoot Ska, Man in the Street, River Jordan, and How Many Times."
2,decent songs - appalling sound quality,"i love ska and studio one output, and many of these songs are catchy (in that chubby checker way - this is early stuff, not the rocksteady/lovers rock/ken boothe/heptones style) - but the sound quality is atrocious. i've read a few reviews that note the bad sound quality, but give good reviews for the music anyway. not for my tastes - there is lots of great ska that sounds good too - i don't need to listen to ska that sounds like it is being played on a garbled tape recorder at the bottom of a deep, tin-sided well. remaster this stuff, for god's sake. and don't say it's because it's analog. alan lomax field recordings from the 30s sounds better than this."
1,I did'nt think it was too swell.,I listened to all the songs but I really did'nt like any of them. I also did'nt see any major bands. So that is why I did'nt like it.
5,Great study for women!,Ruth is not a normal book of the bible to study so having Liz Curtis Higgs research and insight brought the book to life. Both entertaining and informative!
4,better than expected,"A little fluffy, but better than expected. It made a great bible study launch point, and everyone in the group felt free to contribute."
3,Not what I expected.,"I enjoyed this dvd, but it was quite a bit different from the trailer. The speaker/writer is inspirational and easy to listen to."
2,Quite a disappointment,"To be honest, I didn't even realize this book was related to the previous two, until I was about half way through. It is not written at the skill level that Ms. Dodd's earlier books were. I found the writing to be trite. Here's an example:'She opened the door and walked into his home. She looked up at him.He looked down at her.'This was a scene of 'high drama'. It kept getting worse! I had a hard time reading the book because my eyes kept rolling!In previous books, you would feel what the heroine was feeling, without word by word descriptions of what she is feeling!Don't waste your money.And this, from someone who loves all Christina Dodd's previous books!"
3,Disappointing and Curious Theology,"Despite the Biblical injunction, ""Vengence is mine,"" I don't believe I have ever heard of a revenge story that includes God and the hearafter as part of the regenge motif. Not the God of grace, either.I suppose I should get used to the return of the angry God shooting hellfire and brimstone so attractive to politicians these days."
4,Being stalked...,"Kate Montgomery takes a job in Austin, and is terrorized by a stalker. A powerful figure is manipulating her behind the scenes. And her handsome new bodyguard, Teague Ramos, is turning her life upside down, both professionally and personally.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions. President of Just My Best Book Publishing Company. www.janetsueterry.com"
2,A Disappointed Reader,"I as other readers eagerly awaited the finale in the Texas series. However, I truly must say I was disappointed. The whole storyline seemed a bit rushed. The author's mistake was in unveiling the villain so early in the book so by then you had a sense of how the book was going to end. Out of the three books in this series; the first two were the best. Hopefully you will enjoy it more than I could."
4,Enjoyed this one more than the second in the series...,"I enjoyed this book overall and felt it was better than the second book in the series, but I agree with some of the problems noted by other reviewers. The tension/pacing between the two main characters seemed to be a little off. Although there were a couple of great sizzle scenes, the dilemma that caused the hero to be reluctant to delve wholeheartedly into the relationship was weak. But the plot and action overcame the weaknesses in the book and I enjoyed it overall."
5,Definitive Bachrach at his best!,"Anyone who loves the sound of Burt Bachrach can't go wrong here....I have had this album since the 70's, on vinyl, played the grooves out and now am buying the CD. If you, like I, believe that nobody sings a song like the artist who wrote it, you'll reaffirm your beliefs listening to the heartfelt ""A House is Not A Home"". Dusty Springfield sang ""The Look of Love"", but Bachrach wrote it. ""Promises, Promises"" is great. The whole album is the BEST!!! FIVE STARS!!"
3,THE BEST MUSIC & THE BEST MAN,"Let's face the reality, folks: no one does music like BURT BACHARACH. His style is unique, as you can comprove by listening to this album. Songs like The Look Of Love, Reach Out For Me and Are You There With Another Girl have great renditions here. And what a beauty almost hidden gem is Lisa! I've been a fan of BURT BACAHRACH since my childhood and I can tell you: HE;S THE BEST and REACH OUT is one of his FINEST ALBUMS."
3,"Burt, slightly hurt.","I love most of the material on this cd. The music brings to mind those walking in the park scenes in movies that they always used in the 60's and early 70's. The only reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is because of the absolutely yucko version of ""A House Is Not Home"". Burt sings it, and he can't. He should have left it as an instumental like most of the material on the album. With that said, it is a good listening album. Perfect cocktail party stuff."
4,Out Here. Edited Plus!!,"This Love this release is a bit unusual. The eight studio-tracks are all from the 1969 double album ""Out Here"" while the origin of the four live tracks is not time indicated.The studio numbers are selected among the best on ""Out Here"", though I feel it would have been even better if the song ""Abalony"" also had been included. . Two very long tracks from ""Out Here"" have edited down to more normal playing time, which is definitely a win for both songs. Especially ""Doggone"", which is a one of the strongest tracks, has won a lot with the long drum solo being removed.""Out Here"" is in itself a great album, even if only it in glimpses recalls the sound of the earliest albums from the group. This is not surprising as only Arthur Lee is back from the original lineup.Other tracks from the album which also stand out are ""Willow Willow,"" ""Listen to My Song"" and ""Gather Round"".The live numbers are solid - but it is a little annoying that there is no information about origin and line-up."
4,All features not tried out yet.,This toaster oven's appearance is nice. The inside cooking area is larger than most I've used in the past. It seems to heat quickly and do the cooking job more quickly than others I've used. I hear a fan but am not sure how convection works but maybe this is why the oven gets the cooking done more quickly. I have cooked personal size pizzas and they fit nicely. So far I am pleased with it.
4,It Works Great!,This oven took a while for me to get used too. It does get really hot on the outside. Other than that it works great. I would recommend this to a friend.
4,Sharene Langer,"I am very pleased with this item, so far. Not only has it been functioning very well, it is a beautiful addition to my kitchen. I read previous reviews where it was mentioned that the handle get extremely hot, but I can honestly say that I have not experienced this."
4,Retro Look- Modern Functions- Great Product,Bigger than the average toaster oven and I use it for oven only. The knobs are easily understandable and it pre-heats in a jif. I got it in red and it looks really sharp in the kitchen. Front pull out tray makes it easy to clean up the crumbs and spills. Good value for such an attractive product
4,Great Toaster Oven,"This is a great little toaster oven. The convection feature is really convenient and our large casserole dishes fit. It takes a little long to toast, but it's not a big deal."
4,Toaster/Broiler,I am pleased with this item. I use it mainly for broiling meat which it does very well. I like that it has a timer with automatic shut-off feature. Also that the rack can be changed in height is a nice feature. I have not yet tried the bake feature and until I get a pan that fits it I hope it will also be a good feature.
2,Two features missing,"The lettering on the oven stove is too small to read. I didn't like the timer feature for toasting bread. Would have preferred presetting a timer and temperature once(toast light, medium, or dark), and then only having to press one button each time I use the oven for muffins."
2,Disappointed,"Bought ""RED"" so it would match the blender that sits beside it on the counter. This is not a true red. It's more of a custom car candy apple red with metalflake in the paint.Also,numbers and symbols on the controls are difficult to see and use.Otherwise, a reasonable price for a good quality appliance.Thanks,LBG"
4,Basically very happy,"I purchased this Oster Toaster Oven recently and am very happy with it except for one thing. The fan which goes on during Convection Baking starts out quiet, but becomes quite noisy during the cycle. Since this fan cannot be shut off, this can become quite annoying. I had a Hamilton Beach toaster oven, which worked well. Its convection feature could be turned on/off. I don't know why Oster chose to make this a feature which cannot be shut off. To me, it was an unwise decision. I know that other reviewers have mentioned that their fan is also very noisy while others indicated that theirs is completely silent at all times. I should contact Oster and find out if this is a malfunction."
1,Dangerous,"I purchased one for my son and his fiancee in December, and the door on it exploded! Definitely should be recalled."
2,Not up to standard,"Oster used to be a good name....This is more like an over sized 4 slice toasterThe shelves do not fit and slide well, the overall finish is good though.I have real questions about the aluminum broiler tray as when I washed it in the dishwasher it came out with a white powdery coating on it. I wonder if it is anodized as aluminum has shown certain health risks!!!!!!!"
1,BETTER QUALITY OVENS OUT THERE,"GOT THIS BECAUSE IT MATCHED MY RED KITCHEN DECOR. IT LOOKS GREAT, AND REALLY DOES COOK WELL. TEMP IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY, TOAST TAKES FOREVER AND IS NOT EVEN, BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE WITH MOST TOASTER OVENS. I ALSO LIKE THE FACT THAT YOU CAN COOK WITHOUT A TIMER. PROBLEM WITH THIS UNIT IS THE DOOR. IT'S PUT TOGETHER WITH CHEAP, AND I MEAN CHEAP ALUMINUM HOOKS AND SPRINGS. MINE NEVER CLOSED PROPERLY AND THE HOOKS THAT PULL THE OVEN RACK IN/OUT DID NOT FIT. THEY WOULD PUSH THE OVEN RACK OFF TRACK, WHICH IS LOADS OF FUN WHEN YOUR TRYING TO REMOVE SOMETHING COOKING AT 450 DEGREES! AFTER ONLY A YEAR AND HALF, THE SPRING BROKE, AND THE DOOR JAMMED. WOULDN'T OPEN OR CLOSE. WE REMOVED THE SPRING (AND IT WAS A CHEAP PIECE OF JUNK) WHICH WAS MANGLED, AND NOW THE DOOR WILL NOT STAY CLOSED. I HAVE TO USE HEAVY CAN TO KEEP THE DOOR CLOSED WHILE I USE THE OVEN (AND SEARCH FOR A NEW ONE). THE CONTROLS ARE ALSO DIFFICULTY TO SEE IF YOU ARE VISUALLY CHALLENGED."
2,unit lasted for 2 years,Oven worked fine for 2 years. Called up customer service but they could not help since it beyond the 1 year warranty.
4,"Beautiful, efficient, and compact","I needed a small convection/toaster oven to cook for two without having to use my conventional oven for such small things as baked potatoes, garlic bread, roasted vegetables, chicken breasts etc. Also to keep items warm while finishing preparing dinner.Pros:It looks great in my kitchenPlenty of internal oven spacePreheats quicklyMaintains constant temperatureCooks evenlyCons:Item 6293 (Black) comes with only one rackThe supplied broiler pan is cheap aluminumThe timer is a little loud but not too badIt gets very hot on the outside (use mitts to open the door or you can get burned)All things considered I love this product, saves me time, money, works well and it looks great. (Granted I had to buy an additional rack and better pans) but I bought the oven on sale so I ended up spending a little less than the original price."
3,Good to use as a four-slice toaster,"If you're looking for an over-sized toaster to bake roasts or chicken breasts, this is a good one. If you're looking for a toaster that really toasts six slices at once, this is not the one for you. If you use both racks at the same time, the top rack only toasts the top half of the upper toast, and the bottom rack toasts the bottom half of the lower toast. Having to set the temperature every time you use the toaster can be frustrating. But having a timer feature for this price is great.I only use the toaster with the bottom rack turned upside down, so it's more in the middle of the toaster unit."
2,Not worth the price,"I was excited to get this because the picture makes it appear solid and beautiful. Admittedly, I ordered a pre-packaged item and it did disclose minor surface irregularities. However, when the package arrived, it arrived in its original box (not a shipping box) and was severely torn and mangeled and wrapped in packing tape. The item was dented and dinged in several place. Upon my first use I noticed the outer surface gets extremely hot so don't touch it! It appears to be encased in a very thin layer of cheap metal. Haven't used it since."
4,Having good luck so far,This toaster oven is doing all that it said that it would do. No complaints yet.
5,not actually a review...,"im thinking of buying this toaster oven for my first ever apartment in the fall, and i love the red color (though is it too jarring? i saw it is like car paint?) and have seen great reviews, here and elsewhere. what i was wondering, though, is the dimensions on the inside. for the life of me i cant find them online. i saw that it holds a 9"" pizza but would it hold a 12x15"" baking stone? i would really appreciate it if someone could estimate... thanks!isadora"
1,Cheap and flimsy,"This toaster oven is the result of careful engineering to make it absolutely the cheapest possible toaster oven ever built. It is ridiculously flimsy. The power cord is 24"" (2 feet long). I measured it. Unless you are positioning the oven literally right in front of an outlet you will need an extension cord. Seriously, that is how cheap this thing is: they saved money by making the power cord too short.Also, the power cord is UNGROUNDED so the oven is actually dangerous. With no grounding it means the metal case of the oven could potentially be a shock hazard. I strongly advise against buying ungrounded appliances. If a short develops inside the unit, you could electrocute yourself by touching the outside of the oven.I am using the oven a little but in all honesty I expect to break soon it is so cheap. Oster used to make the best toaster ovens, but obviously they are in revenue collection mode now and making a quality product is the farthest thing from their mind."
4,Little workhorse,"I bought my first Oster toaster oven after my kids left for college 6 years ago. I needed something for making toast, baked potatoes, and small casseroles. This oven turned out to be a work horse. We use it everyday and it is especially helpful during Thanksgiving as I roast veggies or heat up a tall casserole full of dressing. I really like that it came with two racks and that the bottom rack goes down far enough to accommodate a large round casserole dish with lid. So now I need to replace it. After years of great service the finish is wearing off and the handle fell off, which is why I gave it 4 stars. After looking at other models and reading thousands of reviews I ordered another Oster from Amazon. I could not find another oven for the money that was as versatile and attractive as this model. The highest rated Cuisinart has a smaller oven capacity and is, IMHO, unattractive. I like how the Oster looks on my countertop and I know that I'll be pleased with it."
1,This is a safety hazard -- explodes!!,"I purchased this oven and was very happy with it. But the fourth time I used it, I was in the other room and heard a loud crashing noise. When I went into the kitchen, I had foudn that the glass front had literally exploded, and there were shards of glass all over the kitchen. Thank God no one was in the kitchen at the time. The oven had only been running at 350 degrees for six minutes when the explosion happened.You apparently get what you pay for. The glass in this oven is NOT of a quality that is able to withstand the heat of a convection oven. If you do buy it and use it, be sure to STAND FAR FAR AWAY from the appliance when it's running, in case yours explodes! I'd hate to see someone get hurt!"
1,They Said New but was clearly Returned,"Seller said this was a new item but package showed up looking like it made its way thru Karachi before it arrived. Breadcrumb tray door was cracked and broken. Other than that this is a great little oven, the seller should just be booted from Amazon."
1,Oster 6297 Convection Toaster Oven,"My wife and I are very happy with this product. I'm still getting used to using this great little toaster oven instead of the big regular oven. Saves on electricity! Works and looks great. We liked it so much, that we got our son one for Christmas! He loves his too."
2,Looks great but hard for everyday toasting,"Okay, I just bought this and will be returning it to the store. Reasons? To toast (which is what I do about 80-90% of the time) you have to turn a knob past the 20 minute mark and then turn it back to some point between fully burned and lightly warmed. In the mornings, I need a button - that's about all I can handle. Also, compared to my old, simple Black & Decker that just broke, your view of what's inside is obstructed by a curved out top and the front is 90-degrees which, interestingly enough, makes it harder to see inside. Weird that I would notice but I guess I got accustomed to what I had before. Other than that, didn't keep it enough to test out the other features."
3,"Oven 4, broiler pan 1","The oven is OK; looks good, performs well. But the quality of the broiler pan is very disappointing. In the first place it looks and feels tinny and cheap. The first time I used it the perforated inner pan warped upward on one corner. I had to turn it back to front under the heat before it resumed its proper shape. Another time I slipped the pan into the dishwasher for cleaning and it came out very discolored and ugly looking. Works OK, but sure looks terrible.The quality of the pan does not fit the overall quality of the oven, in my opinion."
5,Every functional and easy to use,"I read some bad reviews on this product so I was a little skeptical at first but after I bought the product, I absolutely love it! I have this product for a few months now and it's still working pretty well. The toast function DOES work. You have to read the little piece of paper on how to use it. It's not hard at all and I have no problems with the temperature reading as well. I use the toaster oven for light cooking, like making toasts, sweet potatos, heating up left-over pizza, making bacon, waffles... all the food are cooked evenly on both sides if you know how to use it. Some people complained that it's hot to the touch when it's on. Most ovens are hot to the touch when it's on and I don't try to lift the oven when it's cooking so it being hot isn't a problem. It's also very stylish and fits well with my stainless steel appliances and I put mine in the corner of the counter so it fits perfectly there."
3,Not great toaster,"The convection is great, the broiler is good, but the toast is not all that great. You have to use a rotary timer for everything. The distance between the well done and done is about 1/2"" and trying to get toast done consistently is always a challenge. Make sure you have good lighting so you can see what your setting is. A 1/16"" off on the rotary timer and your toast may be too well done or under done for you."
5,My Pride & Joy!,"This made my day- I am absolutely delighted with it! It not only works divinely but also is the greatest color. A friend of mine saw mine, heard my raves, & bought one the next day."
4,Solid performer,"I've been happy with the toaster. It has a larger footprint and capacity than our last toaster, which has made it more versatile for warming/baking and not just toasting. The door front opening is slightly clunky but not a real problem."
3,Average,Not the best not the worse. I got this and was just expecting more. It is not a good toaster and the oven does not cook evenly. I think i should have gone to Wallgreens and picked up a cheapy.
3,toaster over,"i love the oven,i just wish it two shelves,it only has one. it gets a bit too hot in the back,you must watch the cord."
2,No toast for this toaster,"Went through half a loaf of bread before I got a slice of toast the wasn't burned. The dial doesn't work so well for smaller increments required for toasting bread. Not very impressed with the construction methods used either, through the inside of the door I easily could see the glue that had been used to help secure the door handle. Looked a bit rough for a toaster oven of this price."
3,"Ok, I suppose?!?!",This convection toaster oven is just ok. I agree with other reviews the fan while on bake is very noisy. At first I thought it was broken but after reading other reviews I realized it's this model.
1,Unimpressed,"I really wasn't happy with this item. I had to rearange my countertop because the cord was way too short.Also, in order to toast, you have to turn the dial to 20 then back to the correct toasting time. It was a pain, and not consistant.I ended up returning it because it took forever to toast bread, and it just did a flat out awful job at it."
4,"Super little toaster oven, poor timer","I have had this toaster oven for about 2 years now. I love it! It works wonderfully, and is easy to clean and care for. The only issue I have is the timer. As others have said, it's loud, but I don't mind that. It's the fact that it broke. We're having a hard time figuring out if it can be replaced, and it just seems weird that a timer would go out like that - no misuse at all, either. I'd definitely recommend this toaster oven, but wanted to mention the issue we've had."
4,"Works well, looks good, toasting takes a little longer","Like any convection oven, toasting takes a little longer with this guy. It does toast well, it just takes an extra few minutes. Also use to bake chicken, rewarm meals, etc. Looks really nice on the counter, don't let size description scare you - doesn't take up any more space than you would expect from a toaster/convection oven. Overall good value."
5,Oster toaster oven,I had a previous B & D that I thought was great. This one is outstanding and very roomy.
4,Good Value,"I decided with the high cost of engery, and eating by myself most evenings now that it was a sin to heat a huge oven for just me. This toaster oven is fantastic. It broils, bakes, toasts and doesn't heat the kitchen up! It is easy to clean, easy to use (I even taught my grandaughter, who is 8, how to use it in about 5 minutes. Makes the best toasted cheese sandwiches in the world! Holds a whole frozen pizza, but takes up very little room on the counter. Is very light-weight so can be moved easily. The convection feature makes quick work of most meals."
4,Great little wonder,"We have been very pleased with this appliance. We were concerned that it would be cheap looking and be ""wimpy"". This is not the case. It looks great on my counter and had proven easy to keep clean.It heats up in less than 10 minutes. With the convection mode, you need to take 3-5 minutes off of the cooking times, otherwise you could burn things.I look forward to using it during the summer and keeping my electric bill down."
3,"Good value for the money, but ...","Very attractive price. Hard to find a convection oven at this price. I like the easy to use crumb tray, and the feature that pulls out the wire rack when you open the door, keeping you from burning yourself when removing food. But the toaster function has two shortcomings. The first is that due to only two elements on top and two on bottom, that the toast does not get evenly browned. And secondly, the timer function is very hard to set for desired brownness. You have about 1/4 inch from light to dark. It is easy with the timer to set too long a time and burn your toast, so watch your food carefully until you get used to the timer."
4,Works Great!,"I bought mine at my local Target store, I think that it is a great product. Saves space, keep the kitchen cool, and looks cool!"
5,A good buy!,"Our Oster toaster oven arrived safely and on time. It performs very well, especially when cooking pizzas. We can cook a 12"" pizza to perfection in 10 to 12 minutes. The price was good and we did not have to pay shipping charges."
3,Lasted less than 2 years,Looks great. Worked ok but the top burner stopped working in less than 2 years.
2,"Too easily results in ""User Error""","It may be a great, versatile toaster oven, but for just making toast it is not easy to use. There are three dials to set. Two can remain in a particular position if all you are making is toast (but check to make sure no one else change the settings). The third is a *timer* that one must turn past a certain point and then back to the time one wants. The dial rotates 360 deg. For toast, the timer must be turned somewhere between 0 deg and 15 deg on the dial, a very small arc. The dial is small. The lettering is small. After a year we are still burning toast even though we know how to use it. It may be ""user error"" (we are not sure), but if an appliance after a year still frequently results in frustrating errors, then there is some problem with the design.In summary, if you primarily want a toaster oven for making toast, look elsewhere."
3,Pretty good buy,"This is my first toaster oven. It's prettier than my friends', and it's a good size. I haven't toasted bread but I did make a turkeyloaf and it came out decent. I got this toaster oven because I have a kitchenette which I hate and I have no oven. This toaster oven will have to do until I move into a bigger apartment. As far as how hot it gets or the noise, neither are a problem. Just don't touch the oven when there's food cooking, then it shouldn't be a problem. The noise is just little tic-ticking and it's very easy to tune out."
1,reeked of chemicals,"The first time I turned the oven on, it gave off a horrible chemical smell and set off the smoke alarm. Back it went to Amazon. Fortunately, Amazon was great about the return. Ended up getting a Krups toaster oven - more expensive, but no major issues yet."
5,Very nice!,"This has worked wonderfully for our family of six. We recently made the decision to discontinue using a microwave to heat and reheat foods. So I chose to go the convection toaster oven route. It is not only a beautifully designed addition to our kitchen, but it functions extremely well. The simplicity of the dials offers todays users a breathe of fresh air in allowing the use of the convection oven without having to know all the different buttons and settings that you would have with most digital things today. If you are looking for beautiful design, great performance and ease of function, then I would highly recommend getting the Oster 6297 Convection Toaster Oven."
5,The toaster owen I love,"I am very happy with my new toaster owen.It is perfect. I just had to get use to it that it is more poweful than any other I had before. I was tired of changing my smoler toaster owen every so often. Now I know I dont have to do that for a long time.Money well spent. I love it because it is stainless steal. Easy to clean, easy to use.Susan Edem"
2,Great start but burnt out in the end,"After owning this toaster, I can't really recommend it... although it is stylish, roomy and worked well at first, after only 11 months one of the heating elements failed and it no longer cooks evenly.Liked:(1) Attractive look with black and chrome(2) Large capacity for a toaster oven(3) Timer shuts everything off, good safety and convenience(4) Mechanical controls are nice (more reliable??)Didn't like:(1) Died after less than 1 year, heating element melted into the ceiling of the oven(2) One dial for toast darkness and oven timer - so you get all of "" of turning the dial between light and burnt(3) Takes a long time to make toast the first time, then once oven has warmed up can be easy to overtoast(4) Easy to accidentally leave it in ""Bake"" mode and forget to put back into ""Toast"" mode- a dedicated toast button would be better"
2,An Oven Not a Toaster,"Got this toaster oven in red when my little Black & Decker didn't survive a cross-country move. The only thing it did well was broil. Perfect for a couple of chops or round-eye steaks. Other than that, not worth the price. Toast is either not done or burned. Clean the outside once and color/finish goes to crap. The timer is really tricky if you set it for anything under 15 minutes. Also, the glass door is a b*t*h to clean and warped so that there is a gap on the upper right for heat to escape. If you're looking for a good TOven, keep looking."
1,Oster poor quality,"After carefully looking at alternatives I purchased an Oster toaster oven at Target. The design wasn't very good, but . . . acceptable. Then it broke in the first month. Oster makes very poor quality products."
1,not a good oven,"I purchased this for my mother. The first oven cord was hot when plugged in, the fan did not go on, and there was an electrical smell that came from it. We returned it, and the same thing happen with the second oven. Finally, we called Oster, they sent out a new oven, model 6058 and she is very happy with it."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the Red Oster Toaster Oven. When I put it on my counter, with the cabinets above, it did not look at all red; it looked black. The cord touched the back a little and it got really hot, and put out a smell that lasted one hour after it was unplugged, before it went away. The toaster has no setting so you have to just guess. I sent it back for a refund."
4,its cute and its working fine,At first this toster cought my eyes cause its red and it matches my cherry color cabinets. I read the reviews and saw that people were happy with it so I thought it got looks and character! so I got it and I already baked pizza and cookies in it and it cooks quickly and the stuff comes out great.
4,works fine,"This was a gift, and the person I gave to really loves it. She uses it all the time, especially when cooking for just one or two people (instead of firing up her big oven.)"
1,This toaster is UNSAFE,Under no circumstances should you buy this attractive toaster. There appears to be a design defect which causes the back of the toaster to get VERY hot(or at least much hotter than other toasters) and can cause items near it to catch fire. I had a small fire in my kitchen due to this toaster. It is unsafe.
3,Ruby Red slippers,The color is incredible - looks great in my kitchen. All the functions work great with the exception of the toaster function. Took me a while to get use to turning it to 20 then finding the desired number for my particular darkness. Until you get use to it; you MUST watch it!
1,Poor Quality Finish,The chrome accent around the front of the unit discolored from the heat the very first time I used it.
1,Started making an awful noise!!,"I've had this less than a month and it started making an awful noise during the baking process. Toasting is fine. I've contacted the seller Beach Camera (not sure why they sell appliances, but oh well) to see if they will return it for a refund. I definitely don't want another one like it.Proceed with caution."
1,Worst Yet,"This product is the worst yet! If you are looking for a multi-functional toaster oven this is NOT it. The temperature is inconsistent, most foods I have tried to bake take twice as long and cook very uneven; burnt on the outside, raw in the middle. Toaster function usually dose not toast at all or burns to a crisp. Don't be fooled by the high price, you won't get your money's worth!"
5,Easy Five Stars,"This toaster oven is all I needed. Great design and quality for the price. If you are in the $50-$70 range for a toaster you can not beat this one. Made from a trusted company! As for using this oven for toast I can not say how the results are. I perfer to use a toaster for that and it happens to be made by the same brand, Oster. Ofcourse every product will have defects so do no let the negative reviews scare you away without giving this toaster oven a try!"
1,Toaster Oven that Smokes!,"I just bought this toaster oven from the store. I unpack and prepare the toaster to be used for the first time. Here is what I find:- My first attempt to toast (with no bread inside) I see lots of smoke coming from the side of the unit. I did not see any fire and there was nothing inside unit that could have been burning so it must have been the unit itself- For the unit to toast, it takes a VERY LONG time to heat up. It seemed like 5-6 minutes per toast.- The top of the unit was very hot...but to my surprise, the front of the unit was VERY VERY hot. So hot that it would burn any child.I've had to replace several toaster ovens and this is by far the worse yet."
1,Terrible product,This toaster oven should be removed from the market---and any others made the same way. I did a test on the toast function with no food the day the oven arrived. It got so hot on the top surface that it sizzeled water--it would seriously burn you !!! It should never be used with children around. I have a Black & Decker that has developed minor thermostat problems--that's the reason for this purchase. The B & D gets warm on the top--but never HOT. I have returned this Oster.
1,fire burn,"i had this toaster for less than a year when it caught on fire after less than one minute of being turned on. I clean out the crumb catcher religiously so there is no reason that it should have been on fire-but it was. Thank god I had a fire extinguisher on hand. If you want to buy this, then make sure you can stand in front of it and ensure it doesn't go up in flame every time you toast."
2,Toasting happy again,I've been looking for a decent toaster oven for quite a while and have been using Black & Decker without much luck. Tried the Oster recently and have been pleasantly surprised with the quality. One major drawback is that the silver piece right above the door gets extremely hot and I've been burned the first few times. Otherwise the product is exactly what I've been looking for and I am very happy with the overall oven.
2,Plastic handle melts and falls off,"I used this toaster oven for a few months and it worked well. One day I used it on the broil setting at 450 degrees for 30 minutes. The screws holding the plastic handle got so hot that they melted the handle which then fell off. Rather than sending this back in to end up in a landfill, I used two cabinet knobs and some high temperature silicone adhesive to fix the problem. This is a poor design. The handle should not be plastic."
1,terrible,"I will NEVER buy another Oster product after owning this one. I bought this toaster oven about 6 months ago, primarily to make toast, reheat pizza, etc. It has done all of these things poorly. To add insult to injury it just quit. To only last 6 months makes me livid. Do not buy this oven!"
5,GREAT OVEN,I have stainless steel appliances in my kitchen and this oven matched exactly. It looks great on my countertop and does everything you could ask from a toaster oven.
2,Takes Too Long,The timing knob is difficult to grasp and turn. Ours broke after 8 months of use. I liked my cheaper Black & Decker toaster oven better. This one takes twice as long to warm food. It also burns easily on certain settings. Wish I never bought it. I do like the looks of this though and the pull-out crumb tray is great but that is about it.
1,2 years... Busted,This thing busted after just 2 years of use. It actually cooked great up until the end. Now it doesn't even turn on...
5,Makes Toast!,"It's a big toaster, but it works very well. The only downside is that food needs to be positioned on the rack to make sure that it toasts evenly - the heating elements are spaced pretty widely apart."
5,Nice oven,"I use this for mostly toasting and reheating and love it for both. The removable bread crumb tray is a great feature. I also like that the shelf can be turned over to change the height, handy when you are broiling a variety of foods. It is a handsome looking oven. My previous oven, by another company, had a white handle that discolored to a yellow from the heat. I am happy to say that this one has not had the same problem-still looks brand spanking new. There is one thing you should know-the pan that comes with it is a little cheap. I have a Pampered Chef stoneware I use, so it wasn't an issue for me, but if you don't have any toaster oven pans, do know that the pan that comes with it definitely won't last as long as the oven itself."
4,A great Value Convection oven,"I bought this Oster 6295 convection oven about 3 weeks ago and have since been enjoying it. It heated up very quickly with the Convection bake function, and foods were cooked very evenly. It's easy to operate with the classic knobs, and it is a solid, well build small appliance.The only downside is the outside of this oven gets really hot when in use, so make sure you don't touch it or have anything close by that could touch it. I also think it would look better with digital gauges instead of knobs but otherwise, it is highly recommended."
5,Great little oven,"This is a great price for a great oven. Works fast. Looks great. Better than a microwave!Oster 6293 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven, Black"
3,A little amateurish but overall good,"This was a little bit of a let down, all the movies inside this seemed very amateurish. all seemed to be shot with there parents handy cam. the guys in the video are great and sick jumps, but just couldn't get over the quality.i would not buy this again.Shane"
5,"Stop laughing and get this album now, you'll be amazed how good it really is!","Pre-Disco by 10 years and the Bee Gees first is full of Beatlesque tunes and incredible vocals, mainly from then lead singer Robin. Maurice plays the lumbering Mellotron on ""every christian lion hearted..."" it sounds amazingly like a lost Moody Blues track. This album is far superior to my initial initiation to early Bee Gees ""Best of Bee Gee's, this album is more of a complete picture of what these 3 young men were capable of. THere is no sense to try and explain to your laughing friends why the Bee Gees are so good, no one will understand but the true music lover."
4,"Pre-Disco Bee Gees - Great Harmonies, Touch of Psychedelia","Takes the best of the trippy arrangements from the pschedelic era and leaves out the junk. Really nice harmonies on songs that run from plaintive to upbeat and whimsical. If you think The Bee Gees are just ""Stayin' Alive"" this will open your eyes. Note well, if you're looking for disco, look elsewhere. - JA"
5,It's The New Album By The Beatles...Er The Bee Gees!,"According to many sources, The Bee Gees initial 1967 single ""New York Mining Disaster 1941"" was labeled as ""BG"" artist. The music buying public assumed that ""BG"" stood for ""Beatles' Group"", thinking it was a new song from The Beatles! Sure, that song along with the other hit ""To Love Somebody"" could have easily been recorded by The Beatles.Overall, I enjoy this album and do recommend to all fans. Very entertaining."
2,A SPLIT OPINION REVIEW FOR ME ABOUT THIS CD!,"I heard lots about this album that it was their very first debut and they were compared as the earlier Beatles and maybe The Rolling Stones I guess. With a different style of rock'n roll for the brothers Gibb Barry, Maurice and Robin. Because one of them is from England born and the two raised in Australia is a complete strange story but true. Their style of music is a colaboration of soft, heart & soul melodies and hard pop rock temple beats they did as a musical act during the mid sixties!"
5,An Incredible Debut!,"The Brothers Gibb first international album is a masterpiece of songwriting, singing and production. Squeezed in the time zone of British Pop Groups ala the Beatles, they had small chance of doing well, considering they had the same vocal harmonies that the Beatles had (although they started them earlier than the Beatles in Manchester, England). Other than that, this set contains classic, everlasting songs that continue to be covered by other artists. Nearly EVERY song has been sung by another artist and ""To Love Somebody"" has been covered more than 250 times, according to Rolling Stone. Not a small achievement, by any mean, by three teenagers! Hats off to the three teen brothers who took the current technology of the time and survived, despite the georgeous Beatles, ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" of 1967. What a start!Footnote: 1980's Bee Gees technical engineer, Scott Glasel mentioned to me that whenever he feels a need for inspiration, he puts on Bee Gees First."
3,"New Tech, but Old Edison Filiments brighter","Being someone who likes new ""green"" technology I bought this along with another LED ""light bulb"". While they use almost no electricity, they certainly don't deliver the light output necessary to warrent the high price, and compete with other types of bulbs. I gave it three stars, but I am very disapointed. Can't they build an LED light buld to diliver the light output of of standard 60, 75, and 100 watt bulbs?"
5,Be good to yourself,"Be good to yourself and read this book. Women History is American history. This book helped me understand the contribitionsand the travails of American women: and that is White, African American and Native American. It's a loving and profoundcontribution to the understanding of our times and our recent past.Thank you Martha Saxton"
3,Time Travel Classic,"Great book to add to my collection. I was a little disappointed, guess I did not do enough homework before placing my order, to discover that the text of the book is that of a stage play."
2,"Nice knife, but flashlight is useless, falls off","I like how this knife feels in the hand, and the fact that it's very easy to snap open with either hand, left or right.However the add-on flashlight is pretty much useless. The beam is underpowered, and if you twist the head too much - it falls out of the socket, together with batteries and few other small parts... and then good luck finding them all in the dark...So I'd give 4-5 stars for the knife, and 0 for the flashlight."
3,"Safety issue as others have stated, but handy, sharp, and functional","I have a few other knives to compare this to, and overall I like the design and the function of the flashlight. However, it does open when dropped. That is a design flaw and I would like to see this model improved. I actually used this just this morning. At 5:45 this morning I was cleaning out my purse at the Hard Rock Hotel and I dropped an SD card under my vehicle. I couldn't find it in the dark, so I pulled this out of the console and was able to easily locate it with the flashlight. I had previously had a keychain flashlight that I stopped carrying when the batteries died, so this came in handy. The knife has come in handy numerous times as well. I just hesitate to carry it in my purse due to the knife opening on it's own at times."
3,It's OK,"I got this thinking my husband, a cop, might find some use for it. The below are his remarks.PROS-knife, whistle and light combo is nice/interesting-light is OK, but not any better than your average keychain flashlight. So maybe just carry a better knife and a small keychain LED?-whistle is very loud and annoying. Which could also be a con.-lightweight-probably best used as a utility knife to keep in your glove box or drawer, not as an every day knife you carry around. Hubby says ""not many people who carry a pocket knife would carry this as a pocket knife.""CONS-feels cheap-kind of bulky-doesn't feel like it will last if carried every day-could be an awkward combo of things all in one, depending on what you're looking for."
3,"Great Flashlight, Dangerous Knife","This knife, flashlight, and whistle combined tool has some nice features. The LED flashlight is great and comes with a handy magnetic attachment that lets you attach the flashlight to metal in any position. The whistle is loud. The knife is sharp and works great for cutting open Amazon boxes and slicing through the plastic wrap inside.Unfortunately, the sharp knife blade is not locked closed and opens easily - even when you don't want it too. The knife blade does lock in the open position and then requires you to move the metal locking device out of the way of the blade in order to close it. In other words, you have to put your fingers in harms' way in order to close the knife. This design flaw is a serious defect in an otherwise good product."
4,Seems like a useful item,"I haven't been doing a lot of whittling of cleaning fish lately, but if I needed to do that, I'm sure this knife would be just the thing. It is small, lightweight and sharp. The detachable flashlight is pretty cool too. I am putting together a survival kit for next summer's camping trip, and this is going in there. It also includes a nice loud whistle, so it's a good deal."
2,Weak Flashlight derails otherwise cool item.,"This is a cool mini-pocketknife, with a stainless steel serrated blade. The locking mechanism is solid, holds the blade tight in place once out. It's good for quick cutting, like box opening or a fast cut through cord or thin wire.However, the flashlight is a dud. The light is insufficient for any real illumination purposes except for up-close lighting, perhaps lighting your car or front door keyhole. The spin-to-turn-on function is poorly set; too far abd the dial falls off.As for the whistle? Let's put it this way; I'm of a mind that anything you might potentially put against your mouth in the dark should not come attached to an object that could slice your lips off. Final verdict, too much clutter on a decent blade. You'd be better serviced by an old fashioned Swiss army knife."
2,"Nice Ideas, but poorly made","I've had this about a year now, and have used it on about a half dozen jobs. While it works great on some ceramics, and is accurate, it is incredibly plasticy/flimsy and will not break porcelin and other high grade tiles. The problem is that the cutter flexes too much where it should be transferring the force to the tile. The blade is also held in by only a flanged pin, and so popped out the other night. Also, the handle no longer smoothly glides on the shafts. I will try to return this to Amazon if they will still take it back."
5,details,"This is the best book I have bought on the subject.The details are great,anyone can teach the concepts, but she makes a difference by detailing the procedure."
5,I Know Wendy Well - Excellent Book,Length:: 1:50 MinsI'm a big fan of this book from Wendy on Lease Options! It got me started on my Real Estate Investing Career. I consider Wendy a great friend and one who operates in this business with integrity and honor - which few actually do. This book is in the top 3 books I have ever read on real estate investing. Wendy is the authority on Lease Options! Get the book! - Joe McCall [...]
5,Very Well Written,"The book is well written and has lots of practicality for implementation. I typically do not give reviews, however, this one is worth my input. Wendy presents the instruction step by step as an excellent educator would, clarifying along the way certain terms she suspects her readers would not understand. This makes the book very usable to beginning or experienced investors alike"
4,Very Good Information From Top Expert,This is a very good comprehensive book for beginners or seasoned real estate investors who focus on lease options as part of their strategy. I highly recommend this book. Wendy Patton's seminars and boot camps are great!Jack - arizonahousehelp.com
3,Her book is simply an advertisement,"How to Invest in Real Estate using Lease Options and Subject To's is nothing but an advertisement for her more expensive $700 course which includes all the scripts, contracts, forms, CD's, DVD's, powerpoint presentations to Realtors and so forth. I am really disappointed that she refuses to allow you to download these scripts, contracts and forms she mentions in her book for free off her website. Her book is worthless until you are willing to shell out $700 for her course. I love the content of the book but if you are a broke unemployed salesman you will continue to stay broke because it always takes money to make money. There is no such thing as free anymore. No such thing as compassion for those trying to get a brake here."
2,Disappointing...,"What a disappointment from a reputable household name. The iron just kept dripping as I was ironing, and some of the heated drops landed on my foot, which hurt. The steam function does not work for clothes that are hung - it only works when the iron is flat on a surface. If left vertical, the iron would spit out water. The iron was hot enough to get wrinkles out, but as the iron dripped, cloth would bubble up, thereby sabotaging any areas that had been flattened successfully. The only good quality I found about this iron was that it could be disassembled into a very compact unit for travel. I will be returning mine soon enough!"
4,Pleased with this level!,"Ships in factory sealed box well packaged. I shopped around I think the quality of this level is perfect for a contractor or serious do-it-yourselfer such as myself. The level, tripod, and grade rod are all good quality. The instruction manual from David White could be a little more detailed. It's a small booklet giving just the basic instructions."
4,No tutorial to speak of.,"Good product designed in the states. Made in China. CAAAAAAAAAAAAAMOn, what is wrong with this picture? American job's, that is the problem. One other thing is the manufacturer think's that you know what your doing with the tool. Most people just don't. More direction IS needed!"
3,Leather Chair,Comfort is ok but not great as the back is unable to recline. Materials appear of lesser quality than I had expected.
3,where were you when the lights went out,sorry cannot give review as this item has not yetr arrived will do so when it is receivedhope this will be soon
3,Where were you when the lights went out?,Well I love this movie because of all the stuff that Doris has to go though and her husband to get back together after the lights go out. I love all of Doris Day movies. She is from a town not to far from me. I would love to see this one on TV but they don't seem to have it they just run the same ones all the time. I watch them like it is the first time I saw them.
2,Not Up To Par,"I suppose Doris Day's career was just winding down, the writers were getting tired, or perhaps things were just changing too much in those sometimes radical late 1960s for the comedy formula to continue much longer. Whatever the reason, this film just isn't up to par or expectations for a Doris Day sparkling comedy. There are a few laughs scattered here and there, but the characters are oddly almost cold and hardly sympathetic so it's difficult to care about what happens to them, even Doris's character. The film is OK to own if you're just collecting Doris Day films or sixties comedies, but it really isn't all that entertaining."
2,OK,This is an ok film. The sleeping scene is funny including the scene when both Morse's stocking feet and Day's bare feet stick out of the covers. funny
2,Low-Wattage Script Turns Day to Night,"It was only a matter of time before some one turned the the famous 1960s New York City blackout into a bedroom farce--but this script would have been better left in the dark. Day is always entertaining to watch, and supporting players Robert Morse, Terry-Thomas, Steve Allen, and Jim Backus also give their all, but they can't charge up this mishmash of misguided comedy."
3,Strange things happen in New York City Blackout!,"Robert Morse (How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying [1967]) plays an accident-prone man that puts everything in prospective. In exactly 12 hours, New York City will experience a black-out, this November 9, 1965, that changed this man's life. He narrates to you exactly where he will be. While he walks the street, near-accidents could happen to him, but he escapes danger within seconds. This man has just managed to steal a load of cash from his executive workplace. Just as there is a blackout, he can't get an airplane flight out. Doris Day's performance is blacked-out, so show cancelled. Then she catches her boyfriend with another woman. She goes back to Connecticut. The Theif is trying to get to Boston. The paths of these two have been repeatedly crossing this black-out night, but they are about to meet under safe, unusual circumstances. Cast includes: Terry-Thomas, Patrick O'Neal, Steve Allen, Jim Backus, and Pat Paulsen."
5,Wonderful.,"I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is a tender and very funny reminiscence of childhood in the 1950s and 60s and growing to adulthood. The style and the writing are beautiful, and the author is extraordinarily skillful in weaving in the darker threads of her experiences. Although the boys of the title are often the focus of the stories, it is the girls and the women who shine. I can't wait for Jo Ann Beard's next book"
3,Too much effort- or not enough?,"While parts of this book were certainly entertaining, it was very disjointed, and the author's efforts at descriptive writing went way overboard. The chapter called COYOTES was painful to read, in that is was 'all over the place' and had NO flow. I see this writer has potential, but she certainly has not reached that point yet. I would not recommend this book-- unless you would like to practice your editorial skills. If you can forgive the author's lack of skills, you might enjoy it. But, isn't reading supposed to be about escaping, not racking your brain to find a flow?"
1,"Sorry, Sensationalism Doesn't Cut It","I usually don't give such low star ratings to books--in fact this is the lowest I've given--but I'm so in awe of the sentimentality in this book with its quirkiness posing as art that I simply need to express my shock that this would be considered great reading. This may sound harsh, but maybe for a bunch of lonely middle-aged women the quaint little anecdotes in this book would seem comforting--the way group therapy feel ""comforting"" perhaps--but I can't suggest this as true literature, however snobby that sounds."
1,WHEN IS THIS GOING TO END?,"It is impossible for me to imagine how this book got published. It seems the only worthwhile essay in it is the essay that sold the book, the New Yorker's ""Fouth State of Matter."" It's a shame that so good a writer (read that essay and you WILL fall in love) would allow herself to ride on the laurels of that one essay, and pass off the rest of the book as even worthy to be read (let alone be published). This isn't a horrible book, but it's a book that makes me hope Beard continues writing so that we might get a glimpse of her obviously hidden talents."
