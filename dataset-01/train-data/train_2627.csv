2,Primal Rage- boring...,"It's the same arcade game just portable, but thats the problem its the same arcade game! Everything moves slow looks terrible and lacks color. Try Mortal kombat or Samurai Shodown, their much better."
3,What Did You Expect?,"You can't expect a Game Gear conversion of an awesome arcade game to be very good. I thought this was decent though. Mortal Kombat is probably the best arcade to Game Gear conversion, and even that isn't so great.With Gameboy advance now, shoot, you can play a portable Super Mario Brothers 3. You don't need a junk game like this now.This game is something you find when you're cleaning your house that makes you say, ""Oh yeah, I remember that. Good times. Good times."" Then you might play it for about 20 minutes before you get tired of it. It's a cute game to look at, but it's replay value is awful."
4,A Good Read!,"Doc Morey's inexpensive, practical book takes a no-nonsense approach to operating effectively on the telephone. He gives special attention to people who perform customer-service and sales roles. The book briefly describes common worker-on-the-phone problems and offers a quick rundown on how to overcome them. Its concise format helps make it a handy reference guide for anyone who regularly works on the telephone. The specific, efficient tools offered actually can increase your telephone effectiveness, so we [...] recommend this book for anyone who uses the phone in business, especially telemarketers and customer service representatives. Supervisors might want to take a look, as well, so they can train staffers and develop guidelines."
3,"Uneven, but worth the effort","Some parts of this autobiographical work are delightful reading for anyone with an interest in 20th century history. Other sections impress because of Marai's singular gifts as a writer, his powers of observation, and his analysis of the human condition.The book is a bit uneven, however, featuring too much reflecting on the role of the writer in society and his relation to language and so on and so on.Most memorable thought: when Marai has decided to leave his country for good, he makes an effort, before leaving, to read as many books by lesser known Hungarian authors - because those will not be available abroad.Most humorous glimpse of history: when Russian soldiers search Marai's house for German soldiers, calling out ""Hermann! Hermann!"""
1,Phantom Guitar,"As a huge fan of the blues,and of guitar, I was excited aboutlistening to the album Guitar Hero. When I started listeningto the disc I thought my stereo was on the fritz, i couldn't hearany guitar. I'm here to tell you my friends my stereo was a o.k.. Not one tasty guiter lick in any of the ten songs. PeterGreen was one great guitarists of the blues based british invasion. He has gone through some rough times ( drugs, alchcohol,insanity ), but can still bring home some nice stuff. While listening to ""Guitar Hero"" I felt sorry for Peter Green, I felt sorry for me, but most of all, I felt sorry for the people who were about to listen to this cd for thefirst time."
1,Sins of Desire,This movie has been incorrectly listed within a children's book search and a children's book author. Amazon.com has verified there is no connection between the movie and the children's book author and is working to fix this problem.
5,Great entertainment.,"I remember these films from my youth and have always loved Sherlock Holmes stories. I really enjoy watching theseanytime I feel like it. Great, clean entertainment."
1,Sherlock Holmes disappointed,The Classic Sherlock Holmes CollectionI was very disappointed. Video quality of the 2nd disk was horrid. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I got rid of it.
3,so so,"again, if you really like Sherlock Holmes, get the series with Jeremy Brett... you will love that better and will be entertained more than you can imagine - REALLY!!!"
2,"Fabulous actors, horrible reproduction.","I love the Basil Rathbone - Nigel Bruce duo, the classic Holmes.Thus far the movie looks like a copy of a copy of a copy. One of those companies who retrieve the film from the public domain and slap it on a DVD without any remastering whatsoever. I don't know if this is the case, but certainly the quality is similar. The viewing is grainy and very low resolution."
3,Classic Sherlock Holmes,"The first CD with the episodes starring Basil Rathbone were quite good. The second CD, however, containing the episodes with the various other ""Sherlock Holmes"" was just awful -the picture and sound were so bad, I threw the entire thing away. Now I'll look for another production of the episodes with Basil Rathbone again."
3,beware,"Only the first section is Basil and the rest is a different actor, and the second section is very poor sound and picture quality."
2,A tutorial only,"This book provides some basic tutorials for learning JavaScript. Some of the tutorials are good but others are not adequately explained. It includes a partial explanation of objects but assumes prior knowledge of structured programming. Lots of unnecessary repetition of code listings makes the book twice as thick as it needs to be. It is useless as a reference book, so I think the title is misleading. This book by itself will not teach you JavaScript . I was able to use this book as a starting point to learn JavaScript but only because I also referred to other books and on-line reference sources. I think including a CD is just an excuse to charge $50 for what should have been a $15 book; I didn't find anything useful on the CD."
3,A friendly introduction to the language,"Unfortunately, the title is very misleading so I gave it a three instead of a four, but the book offers the beginner a good, painless foundation to the language. It doesn't cover all the intricacies of JavaScript, but it puts you in a position to pursue the more comprehensive but not as friendly treatments found in the some of the other texts (e.g., O'Reilly, JavaScript Bible).It points out the incompatibilty in the browsers, and gives basic treatments for handling each.Though I'm an experienced programmer, I read it on my daily bus commute in a week. The book assumes a basic familiarity with HTML, and little programming knowledge."
2,Rough on the edges.,"Page 388 on the navigator object says: ""navigator object's properties are appCodeName, appName,........userAgent, javaEnabled, and taintEnabled. Page 73 says: ""navigator methods are javaEnabled, taintEnabled. My question is: are javaEnabled and taintEnabled methods or properties ? The book contains many such contradictions."
1,Not helpful for cross-browser scripts,"I bought this on the publishers review, before amazon.com had written one. I thought this book was going to be what I needed to help me sort out the different document object models of Netscape and IE. This is definitely not a book for anyone other that a complete beginner. The appendix that lists keywords doesn't list version numbers!! Script are shown in their entirety as the author adds more and more complexity. In the last step, the script is complete or nearly complete. Then the whole script is shown again! This makes for a lot of unnecessary page flipping. The examples are very elementary and did not help me in the work I do with JavaScript. There is not a reference that lists objects and keywords with their browsers compatibilities. It also has a chapter about connecting JavaScript and Java before really discussing many needed things about JavaScript alone."
5,It paid for itself in the first two hours of reading!,"I had bought two other books (Designing with Javascript - O'Reily & JavaScript Bible - IDG Books) to use as a reference for my latest web projects. Both the other books had script examples that didn't work! JavaScript Complete has proven accurate (so far) and I've adapted several scripts since buying the book, and they worked first time. Also has the best CD of the three books - Other two books are relegated to the back of the book case! this one stays on my desk A very easy to read book, with step by step examples for writing scripts. I'd say it is good for novices and intermediate JavaScript developers. Excellent reference for diferences in NetScape/IE browser support too. Go buy it now!"
1,Don't waste your money or time with this one,"The title of this book JavaScript Complete isn't only missleading its an outwright lie. The book is writen at the most basic of all levels, even someone with no programming experience would find it to basic. The size of the book could be cut in half if it wern't for the incredible about of code repition. Oh, while I'm on the subject of code his coding style is sad to say the least, not to mention the fact I found I few things to be just plane wrong. Don't be fooled by the title there is nothing complete about this book, I honestly can't emagine anyone who would benifit from it. Your money would be much better spent on a less expencive more comprehesive book."
3,title of review,"On their previous album they consistently wrote songs that lifted them well above the pop-punk emo norm. They had some of the characteristics of a Drive-Thru band, but were more melodic, intricate, interesting and creative. I think they changed some members between the album and this ep. The first two tracks here are really standard emo pop-punk. What you'd expect from some garagey local band aspiring to get signed to Drive-Thru. It's bad. The third track is more like the songs on their album. The fourth song is lower quality, a bit punkier. Fifth song is blah. Sixth song is ok, but reaffirms my reaction to the first two tracks, they've really taken a huge step backwards in the maturity of their sound and songwriting. It's odd. The last track, 17 Seconds, is really damn good. It sounds like something right out of Mock Orange's The Record Play album."
4,Overall good cd,"This band has changed a lot since Composition. While many people criticize them with conforming to pop/emo/mainstream standards, they really haven't. Sure, some of the songs are more mainstream-type but the whole cd is a mix of many different kinds of songs and I like the variety.I definitely prefer Composition to the Curse, but Curse is worth buying. I believe the whole $12 or so is worth paying simply for ""Heaven."" It has become my favorite My Hotel Year song & is definitely worth the price."
4,"A classic, lovingly researched and written","This book is a dignified piece of historical writing. Although it is long, it manages to be significant throughout. The personality profiles are interesting, the battle descriptions are gripping, and the political analysis is acute. Before reading this volume (and its companion), I did not realize how pivotal the events of this era were in shaping the rest of 19th century US. Recommended to those with time to ponder, especially if they are fond of Adams' writing style."
4,Adams: History of the US - Madison Administration (2),"Although dated, these volumes remain a must. They are dated (1889-1991) but they provide a glimpse about the past history of the US. Following this time, with the end of the Spanish-American war documents came to light providing sometimes different views of historical moments such as the role of Gen. James Wilkinson with the Spaniards."
2,Side mirrors,"It came in on time and in a secured box. It looks great and everything, But my own concerned is that the the plastick where too long it left a good 3-4 inch gap and screws are way too long... But I manage to made it fit and snug. I own a 1992-1995 hatchback eg. So I'm not really sure if it was for a 1992 4 door eg..."
3,"pretty, but could be better","Very pretty design - - plain, simple and elegant. Lacking in some heft though. They feel quite light and flimsy. If you're digging into a frozen scoop of ice cream, I'd worry the handle would bend. I expected more from Henckels. I was also a bit disappointed that the actual size of the spoon is quite tiny - - not a real teaspoon size but halfway between a teaspoon and a demitasse spoon. For stirring drinks or eating ice cream in parfait dishes, they are just fine. I was hoping to use them to spoon out olives or capers from tall jars though, and for this purpose, the spoon is just too teeny.Much more form than function, however at this price, I have no regrets about this purchase."
5,Nice spoons.,"I received these spoons and they are very nice. Perfect length and the finish is great. They are not as heavy as some may want but, all I want them for is stirring drinks and for that they are great even in the tall glasses I use."
5,There is no better quality,"I use ice tea spoons for so many things that they always end up in the sink dirty. My mother had bought me 8 from Walter Drake to supplement mine a few years ago, but that wasn't enough. I toyed with the idea of getting more from Walter Drake, as much as I despise that company, since their spoons were better than I had expected--not overly strong, perhaps barely adequate would describe them, slightly better than the Uri Geller type spoons you find at inexpensive diners, and $12.99 for a set of 8 is cheaper than the Henckels. I am so glad that I decided to go with the Henckels item instead. The handles of the Henckels are as thick as the Oneida stainless I have, but are slightly wider and are actually stronger, so they are the best that I have now, a significant quality improvement over the Norpro from Drake or the Nasco that I also have."
5,Perfect for ice cream and drinks,"I am loving these spoons for ice cream, drink mixing, and eating cereal from a cup. These spoons have a little curve at the end of the handles that gives a little more control and flair than other long-handled spoons I have used. They make eating any brand of ice cream feel elegant.These spoons feel strong and solid. I have been running them through my dishwasher and they still look beautiful."
3,A good read on the broadband bubble,"Om Malik provides an interesting view of the second bubble of the new century, although the book isn't a tremendous read. For anybody interested in the origins and ramifications of the broadband bubble it is definitely worth reading, but don't expect the book to be anything as compelling as Barbarians at the Gate, Conspiracy of Fools or Serpent on the Rock."
4,Like Reading Your Obituary in Living Color,"I enjoyed the book very much. Chapter by chapter Om Malik gives the reader story by story of leading companies during the late 90's early 2000's and how they were brought down. Thought painful, as I along with many lost money during this period it brings home many basic investment thesis and bubble philosophies and makes for great read."
2,Soundtrack? Not exactly. . .,"For those of you wondering what that great blues number is at the beginning of this movie, it's a song called ""Hard Workin' Man"" performed by Captain Beefheart. This song was originally written for a movie called ""Blue Collar"" and can be found on the new Beefheart anthology ""The Dust Blows Forward"" from Rhino.Pretty entertaining movie if you're into lawyers and such. Too bad they didn't bother to put any of the good blues cuts from it on the soundtrack. Oh well, that's showbiz. . ."
3,Bright color,"We have enjoyed these, but the tub I got only had four blue tablets, so we are rather limited in what colors we can make."
1,CAREFUL! May cause breathing problems.,My 8 and 10 year old used this tonight and all of us experienced a bitter taste in our mouths and throat along with constant coughing by my asthmatic daughter. I just stepped in to check on my 10 year old who used 2 tablets in a full tub of warm water and left with a headache and nauseating feeling. I can't wait to hear what the company's feedback will be.
1,I think it's making my boys sick!,"My 3 boys (age 4 and 2-yr-old twins) love the colors. BUT! We noticed on several occasions now that afterwards they complain of a tummy ache and feel nauseated. Last night after a bath, the twins weren't feeling well and threw up this morning upon waking up. At first, we thought it was a virus but they were absolutely fine the rest of the day. I noticed there is one more similar review on Amazon."
5,Bath Time Fun!,"My little guy got these as a gift - and they have been a definite hit! He loves them, loves the bath even more now. So, for a mom - nothing but a big 5 Stars for these!"
3,my son loved them!,I didn't like that the container was so small i expected it to be bigger and the fizzers to be bigger.. i had to use at least 2 in order for it to turn all the water the color i wanted.. my son loved them though. and the price wasnt bad at all for them.
5,Super fun!,I bought this for my four year old nephew and he loves it. My sister keeps telling me how he asks for bath time now. He want's a purple bath today or a green bath or a blue bath. He has so much fun with his colored tubs he makes me want to put one in my own bath :)
4,Fun but not educational,"My two year old daughter loves these bath coloring tablets. They fizz and turn the bath interesting colors. In our experience, they also don't leave annoying colorful film on the tub, which is a big plus.On the other hand, they are NOT helpful in teaching colors. If anything, they create confusion because the tablets (which are blue, yellow, and purple) don't come in many colors, and the purple tablets dye the water a very bright hot pink, not purple."
4,Good fun for bath time,"My kids love having these in the bath. The tablets dissolve quickly and the water starts turning colored instantly. The container is huge because the tablets are not that large, but there were 24 in the container I got."
5,"Bob Hope's book, ""I Never Left Home"" is a gas!","This awesome, delightful book I read years ago and loved it, thought I would never see it again, then fortuitously found it on Amazon, and voila, it was mine to own. A delightful book about a war? Yes, because Bob Hope brings to life the lighter moments of war by entertaining the troops, experiencing all the red tape, the colorful characters he met... the memories they all gave him, and I highly recommend it!"
3,Cut concept with matching blanket but...,"Didn't fit my 6 week old daughter's head right. The knot is adjustable so you can re tie it where it will fit best, but I suppose my daughter's head is too tiny because even the brim was loose on her. Slipped over her face while in her carseat and I didn't know until she cried and sounded muffled. Cute concept with the matching blanket I bought, but product, at least for me, was a no go."
3,Some good points,This book was alright. Christel has some really good nuggets of truth. Learning about tribal beliefs and how to re-write them I found interesting and helpful. However the book is incredibly repetitive and Christel seems like she might be a little crazy. If you read it with a grain of salt and skim some of the personal anecdotes I think the book has lessons to learn.
4,great points,"could give a bit more detail beyond the affirmations as to how to work past your past but overall a thought provoking, well written book."
5,A literary treasure from a human treasure...,"What a beautiful, beautiful book. I frequently think of how blessed I am to have met Christel and to have blossomed as a result of doing my spiritual work at her weekend workshops. (If you have attended one, you know you have to do more than just show up, you have to be willing to dig in!) I feel that those weekends and the work I did, in addition to the private readings with Christel, completely altered the course of my life. Now I feel SUCH JOY in knowing that the same epiphanies (especially regarding tribal beliefs!) and spiritual gifts that were awakened in me over the course of many years of work are available to everyone through this book! When you arrive at page 306 of Sacred Choices, you will have nothing standing in the way of your health, success and greatest happiness!"
1,Not so Sacred Circles,"I'm sorry, but I had to quit reading this book after page 25. Ms. Nani repeatedly regurgitates phrases and thoughts are are just plain common sense. This may be a good book for folks that need their hands held and reminded about behaviors, feelings, moments of self-doubt, etc., but attributing one's personal conflicts to some kind of competition between society (or the Tribe) and what your inner voice (also known as commmon sense or intuition) is telling you then proceeding to give you ways of quieting the conflict through the realization of these contradictions smacks of pop psychology and reminds me (at least) of a lot of realizations I made while as a young adult. We will always have contradictions in almost all parts of our lives and her approach to resolving them is naivé at best."
2,Better than we had.,"The book was said to be in Very Good condition but, was in OK condition. However it is better than the one we had."
2,Least favorite of Cesar Millans DVD's,I love Cesar Millan & all of his other Dvd's but this is very cheaply made compared to his others.Very much him giving a presentation to a class type feeling.While His others take you inside owners homes & really show training start to finish.I don't recommend this one but all others I've seen are excellent.
3,"Not what I expected, but still helpful","I don't think this DVD was worth the money because I really expected more direction in pack leadership than occuring in the DVD. I have been trying to learn Cesar's techniques for several months and had hoped this would give me some more specific direction in becoming a pack leader. I feel that I got a lot more theory than direction, but the theory is still helpful."
1,Worst thermometer ever! Hard to believe but it's totally inaccurate.,I never write reviews for Amazon but I felt that I should for this terrible product. I can't believe how someone in this day and age can manufacture an inaccurate thermometer! This thing has been off since day 1. It's about 5-7 degrees less than the actual temperature. Save your money and buy a regular thermometer instead. This is a waste of $$ and I finally just threw it out.
3,Floating Pool Thermometer,"The thermometer floats just fine, and looks pretty neat in comparison to a regular one. My only problem is the numbers are a bit small and are difficult to read."
1,Broke after 7 months,"Semi-accurate, to within about +/- 3 degrees by my estimation. But, started to rust after 3 months and completely broke after 7 months by the interior enclosed temperature shaft simply cracking and breaking entirely."
4,Coby Portable DVD Player,"This portable DVD player has a great picture and many good features. The remote control is great -- has many more functions than are available on the unit itself. My only disappointment is the sound. It sounds great through headphones. But if you want to watch with another person, the audio from the unit is extremely low."
2,battery problems and charging,I bought this is Swpt. (4 monnths ago) and battery does nt hold charge very desappointing purchase. Wouldn.t buy abain. Plese excuse spellings 3 yr. old helping my write this and having trouble withe dlete key on computer.Hwlds car bumps OK but battery wothless cannot charge anymore anfter 4 months.
4,great introduction to Glantz's other works,"This is pretty much the shortest and easiest read of all books written by Glantz. It's a great introduction to his more detailled analysis of the major battles of the russian front. The book would have gotten 5 stars if over 20 pages of barbarossa were not copied from his other book ""when titans clashed"". Or is it the other way around? Needless to say i was dumbfounded to reread the same thesis twice, in two different book. Anyways, it still a fascinating book."
2,Too many mistakes,"I don't want to dwell on, so let us consider just illustrations. In the beginning of the book you can find: ""All illustrations are from the author's collection."" Therefore, photos have been picked up by David Glantz and it is him who is responsible for their accuracy.#202 (page 196) ""Red army machine-gunners..."" Excuse me, but on the photo there is an anti-tank rifle, not a machine-gun...#91 (page 65), #139 (page 129), #147(page 137) #189 (page 178) #198 (page 192) the photos are definitely are not of Barbarossa time. Well, on these photos Soviets wear post-Stalingrad uniform...How can we take seriously the rest of the book???"
1,Say it's Not Harry,"This album is a huge disappointment. If your expecting Harry Connick's usual music forget it. The arrangements are horrible and I did not listen to one selection all the way through. I gave the album away.....This STINKS.If you play this on a computer say thanks Sony for loading spyware on. Note the album (in little tiny print says will not play on some CD, DVDs, and this is an understatement."
2,A big disappointment...,"This is a real comedown from Harry's other Christmas album. WHEN MY HEART FINDS CHRISTMAS had the holiday magic to bring you back time and time again, but this album is lethargic with languid arrangements and no pizzazz to speak of. Harry's ""original"" songs are some of his worst. A huge disappointment, unfortunately."
3,"Great Songs, but.......","On impulse and because so many of my friends said they liked Harry Connick, Jr., I bought this cd. Most of the songs have been around for years and he does an okay job. Overall, I was dissappointed in the cd. While he has a nice voice and he does a good job, I wasn't impressed. Sorry, Harry."
2,Harry for the Holidays,"I was very dissapointed in this CD. After seeing Harry on the Today show I was very excited to buy this CD, but what I heard on TV was the best the CD had to offer. The first few songs were great, very ""new"" arrangement of some classics, but after that Harry get's way too sappy."
5,Love it!!!!!,"Good job Harry! The first album I bought of Harry's was ""Come by me"" and I have been hooked. Keep up the great work."
4,Not as good as his first Christmas album,"I'm a big fan of Harry Connick, and his first Christmas album (When my Heart Finds Christmas) is one of my favourite album of his, to the point where I listen to it all year round.When I heard Harry was coming out with a new Christmas album, I was very excited and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Unfortunately, ""Harry for the Holidays"" didn't live up to my expectations. It's still a good album, but it doesn't carry the same punch as ""When my Heart Finds Christmas"" and sometimes it hardly feels like a Christmas album.That being said, there are several songs on the CD which more than make up for the weaker points. I'm sure that my appreciation for this album will grow with time."
4,Connick Sings Classic Christmas Tunes,"Sure, most of the songs below are ""the usuals"", but Connick's pleasant voice and excellent pacing make them very listenable. Most of the accompaniment falls into the jazz area.1. Frosty The Snowman2. Blue Christmas3. The Christmas Waltz4. I Wonder As I Wander5. Silver Bells6. Mary's Little Boy Child7. Santa Claus Is Coming To Town8. The Happy Elf9. I'll Be Home For Christmas10. I Come With Love11. Nature Boy12. O Little Town Of Bethlehem13. I'm Gonna Be The First One14. This Christmas15. Nothin' For New Year16. Silent NightProbably won't be your top favorite, but certainly expands your Christmas listening options. I particularly liked his handling of ""Mary's Little Boy Child."""
2,Very Disappointed,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Harry fan, but Harry For The Holidays is a major let down. His earlier holiday album When My Heart Finds Christmas is my all time favorite holiday disc, but I could barely sit through this one. He sounds forced, almost as if he is trying too hard to be original, and it just doesn't work. If you don't already own it, pick up When My Heart Finds Christmas and leave this one on the shelf."
5,Cheering about this HOLIDAY CHEER !,"Unfortunately, since Sinatra can no longer grace us with a new collection of seasonal recordings, the next best thing is . . . HARRY CONNICK JR.The musical production on this CD outshines the prior collection of seasonal recordings created by HARRY CONNICK JR.This CD shall fast become a classic staple in the musical catalogue of Holiday recordings. Jazz influenced Pop at it's best ! The perfect holiday recording for a new generation."
5,It was fabolous,"Harry Connick Jr. did a superb job with this CD. I love the jazzy touch he brought to all of these wonderfull songs. I use to just listen to Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis, and Bing Crosby for during the Christmas season, but I think this CD brings a nice change to my collection."
3,Better than the first!,"As much as others have been lamenting over Harry's second Christmas album, at least there is not a rendition of him singing ""O Holy Night"". In comparison to the 1st Christmas album, I have enjoyed this album. His bouncy, jazz influenced melodies are great for wrapping presents to. I will suggest that if you want a real uplifting Christmas album, buy The Brian Setzer Orchestra Christmas album. That one will get you moving!"
1,"I was so excited to buy this, but so disappointed!","I thought this album would be fabulous. I was so wrong. Harry just isn't up to his usual standard. He sings in a lackluster way through holiday favorites. As a result, the holiday classics don't sound that great and Harry sounds tired."
3,Doesn't work on computer players!!,"We use our computer to play all music, and this CD comes with its own software - so you can't direct your computer to play it through Windows Media Player or any of the common audio players like Winamp. In fact, after about 20 minutes of my computer trying to open the CD, freezing, and having to be re-started I gave up and sent this CD to the car-music box - only to be played on a dedicated CD player. Although I can understand why companies bundle software into their cd's for computer playing, its tremendously inconvenient for the listener who just wants to hear some music. So what did I think of the music? Don't know, I was so irritated I haven't listened to it yet!"
2,Aww!,"I was so excited when we saw this at Costco, I told my husband we just HAD to buy it. After listening, all I can say now is ""thank goodness for Costco's generous return policy!!"". I hate to be the only one (so far) to express this negative opinion, but this CD... just was not what I was expecting from Harry. We own ""When My Heart Finds Christmas"" and LOVE it. Maybe I was expecting ""Harry for the Holidays"" to be similar. A little jazz here, a little soul there.... but, no. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for new and even different than usual arrangements of traditional songs, but this was just wayyyy to much ""oomph!"" for my holiday. Maybe next time, eh?"
3,Exceptional,"This CD was ""ok"" because christmas albums need a soulful and emotional connection to them. I agree that he does have the type of ""cookie cutter"" voice--- great for that light jazz-rock type of feel but not for the soulful christmas feel you would get from other artistsI recommend instead--which i havent heard from many people:The Destiny's Child Christmas Albumand two other notables : One Wish - Whitney Houston and Celine Dion's 1999 Christmas Album"
1,A Dissent,"It's hard for me to understand the enthusiasm for this album which I frankly consider to be one of the worst Christmas/holiday albums that I've ever purchased. The big band sound and Harry Connick's crooning can't hide the superficial commericialism of his vocal renditions. Though he aspires to their style, Connick is no Frank Sinatra or Tony Bennet."
1,horrible band,First heard this on Oprah and the band used on the show is not the same as the one on the album. Wish it had been. I haven't heard such crash and ugly lead trumpet playing in a long time.
2,Harry For The Holidays...,"I purchase this Christmas album along with Whitney Houston Christmas album ""One Wish"". Harry For The Holidays is pretty good, but I love Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"" more. I like how she took old classics, and made them sound so fresh and new. She even have a new cut ""One Wish"", and made it into a beautiful Classic...""One Wish"" The Holiday Album is the way to go I recommend that cd to everyone who love ""Good Music"". I mean nobody can sing ""Joy To The World"" like Whitney Houston. She brung the house down with this CLASSIC!"
1,this album stinks,i hate harry for the holidays he sucks just like his stupid singing voice harry sucks@!
1,Harry For The Holidays,"What a waste of $15.00. I usually like Harry's music, but I totally hate this CD."
4,Very Pleasing,This is a pretty good christmas CD. Soothing and blissful and he's cute too.I'm gay. And so are the holidays. MERRY CHRISTMAS
2,NOT MY CUP OF TEA,"Although I generally like Harry Connick's voice, I can't say I am won over on this CD. I just can't get into ""jazzy"" Christmas carols. I'd rather have an album sung traditionally."
1,Too jazzy.,"If you like jazzy Christmas music, this is the CD for you. Otherwise, it's a CD full of music that never seems to slow down. I wouldn't have bought it had I known every song was jazzed up."
1,"Oh, Boy, Harry, Thanks a Lot . . . Really, Man, Thanks . . .","About 30 seconds into Harry's version of ""Frosty the Snow Man"" I started slamming my head against my George Foreman Grill, just hoping the music would stop.And it didn't get any better by the time ""Blue Christmas"" rolled around, because then I started brushing my teeth with an egg-beater.Merry Christmas, Harry. Keep on torturing us with your merry brand of jubilee, buddy."
2,This is not the Harry Connick Jr that I love....,"I bought this album based on a recommendation from a blogsite that I visit regularly. I was looking to add to my holiday music collection. But this turned out to be the strangest collection of holiday songs EVER! All of the arrangements are bizarre. I think the producer of this album wanted to ""do something different"". And that was accomplished. But, seriously, my copy went from my mailbox to my CD player to the Goodwill box in less than an hour. I love Harry. But I DO NOT love this album!"
5,Wheres Jingle Bells?,"I love the new Harry Connick Jr. CD. It is very reminiscent of his first Christmas album. However, there is an extra track ""Jingle Bells"" that is only included if you purchase the CD from Target. As far as I can see, Amazon is not offering this version. If you can live without this track, then buy it from Amazon. However if you are a Harry Connick Jr. fan (like myself) you'll make the trip to Target to get the complete version."
5,Harry has grown up!: A wonderful CD from an amazing artist,"I've been a HCJ fan for years. I adore ""When My Heart Finds Christmas,"" which has a been a standard to which I compare other holiday CD's. WMHFC was the first time Harry did any of his own arrangements. And what an excellent result! But ""Harry For The Holidays"" reveals that Harry's talent has grown by leaps and bounds. It blows me away with it's complex and interesting arrangments.This is not traditional big band! There's a lot of New Orleans inspired sounds on here. But Harry also takes traditional songs on exciting departures. ""Mary's Little Boy Child,"" and ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"" are brought to life with new rythyms, but still with respect to their sacred lyrics. Harry is NOT the ""It Had to be You"" kid anymore. He takes chances with his music that are challenging and inspirational. If you want a new holiday CD that is more than just bells jingling in the background, you'll definitely get a spicey holiday gumbo with this one"
4,Very good indeed,"I am glad I found this author, but it is a pity so many of her earlier novels are out of print. This one is a sweet love story, finely written."
2,"This is a sweet, slow paced love story.","Although the heroine is sweet, and the farm life described is wonderful, the books starts too slow. In the first 150 pages the hero and herione have only bumped into each other once in a parking lot. There are many references to characters from other books, which was confusing. But the pig is cute!"
2,Moon Dance,"Not as good as some of her other books I have read, disappointing and difficult become interested in it. Put down on a number of occassions and eventually abandoned"
4,Mariah Stewart books,"Have read all of Mariah Stewart's books, in order, the best way. This one, ""Moondance"", comes before ""Priceless"". Other series have 3-4 books in them and the characters of the series are at least mentioned in the others in the series while the book itself concentrates of two main characters."
4,Locke holds her own...,"I loved Kimberly Locke's song ""8Th world wonder"" and I got this CD only for that song...I should say that I was happy with this CD. I didn't care so much for her on American Idol 2 but, I love this CD. It is a really strong CD. It highlights her voice and the music and everything flows together. I was pleasantly surprised and not disappointed in buying this CD. Over-all all the songs on this CD are good, but there are a few that I do skip. But, I should say they are all growing on me! I think if you like more of a pop/R&B sound this CD is for you. A side note, she does remind me a little of Kelly Clarkson. But, holds her own ground and makes a name for herself; especially once you own this CD and listen to it-Kimberly Locke can hold her own ground."
3,"I like alternartive, but where's the R & B?","Unfairly, I have not bought the CD (hence, middle of the road rating-'3), but Kimberley had me anticipating her release. I heard ""8th World Wonder"" when she debuted it on AI, but her voice deserves better than what they're marketing her as. From other reviews, it sounds like I should hold my money {which is too bad}. I'm not big on remakes, however, she would do an excellent Phyllis Hyman rendition!"
2,doesn't sound like her,"this album does not sound the old kim locke from american idol, the girl with rich, powerhouse vocals.. she sounds more like a bubble gum popstar overall in this album.. of course, there are a few exceptions of songs in which she sounds rich and powerful as usual"
2,Not That Great! Expected Better!,This Cd in my mind came too soon for Locke. I would expect more from her. Since she could really sing. Most of the songs do not really click. Somewhat disappointed.
2,Not As Expected,"I really liked Kimberley's voice on American Idol. I thought this CD would be very good, since I really like the first single, 8th World Wonder. Boy was I let down. I have Kelly Clarkson, Tamyra Gray and Clay Aiken's CDs and absolutely love them. Maybe I expected Kim's to be as good and it is not. Don't waste your money on this one and just get the single. Or copy a friends."
1,I didn't like it,"I listened to my friends cd, just to see if I would want to purchase this CD, and to me it didn't sound like the Kim I loved on American Idol. I was very disappointed in most of the songs but two. The one on the radio and the one with the other American Idol contestant, Clay Aiken. He sounds great with Kim on ""Without You"". I really like Clay Aiken's CD, but I thought I would like Kims. But I don't."
2,Ugh,As a huge fan of Kimberley Locke from American Idol I was excited to go out and buy this CD and really wanted to love it. After listening to it twice it isn't living up to my expectations...and not because there isn't potential there. Her vocals are just overpowered by background music which takes away from her great voice. I hope Kimberley finds new producers and comes out with another album in the future which emphasizes her vocal ability.
1,WHO IS SINGING??,"Sounds just like Kari Kimmmel! Exactly, this in not the voice of Kim Locke from American Idol! Very disappointed! There are only 2 songs on this album that I do like! TWO! 8th World Wonder, and With Out You with Clay Aiken. Other than those 2 songs, the album stinks, it is just not the Kim I wanted to hear!"
5,Kimberley Locke ... My American Idol,"If you are a Kimberly Locke fan, you won't be disappointed! She makes beautiful music effortlessly. The duet with Clay Aiken is worth the cost of the CD...but, you get so much more! Every song is great in its own way. I've practically worn out my CD from playing it over and over and over."
3,Good CD!!!,"I just purchased this CD today and like it. My favorite song is the duet that Kim does with Clay, ive listened to that song more than once. This CD was worth the money I paid so im happy."
4,"It ""coulda been"" better but still shines","Pertaining to the debut release of American Idol runner-up Kimberley Locke, I have mixed feelings. I don't agree with most of the reviews on this board. Only Love proves that Locke is yet another talented artist and that the breakout hit ""8th World Wonder"" is worthy of a Grammy nod for Song of the Year. I agree that some of these songs don't sound like Kimberley Locke but it's a worthwhile release besides that."
3,Just can't picture it..,"I love Kimberly Locke's voice and was very disappointed when she didn't win. I'm also disappointed in the CD. She sounds absolutely fantastic but I just can't picture her singing some of these cheesy ""pop"" songs. She's destined for Jazz and R&B iconship not this. I hope this album gets her enough exposure to get her a record deal that presents her as the classy and soulful lady she is. There are a few good songs on here but it was not at all what I expected."
2,so dissapointing,"Please forgive me for I LOVED Kimberly on AI. I found this CD a great failure for her talent. All the songs sound alike. I have tried to like this CD, but can't bring myself to say I enjoy it. I hope she finds someone better for her next CD who will really show what she can do."
5,One of the best AI singers to date...,"Kimberley Locke is by far one of the best AI singers of all time (Tamyra Gray and Jennifer Hudson amongst others). She had the versitality, the voice, the look, and the personality to be an IDOL... To be completely honest she was the best singer in SEASON 2 (way way way way way better than clay and ruben combined in my opinion)...ONE LOVE is the best American idol LP to come out as well... he voice overpowers the songs and takes you on a journey of amazement. The only thing i dont like about this LP is the ""over the rainbow"" (re-mix). I dont like that version at all. I wish she just put another song that she sang on the season (i.e. ""crazy"" or ""inseperable"")K-Lo was declined the crown in Season 2 but she is my AMERICAN IDOl... one love...."
3,She needs a new producer,"First off I LOVE KIMBERLY LOCKE. But she needs to get hold of her career and get a new producer. The songs are OVER PRODUCED. the arrangements terrible. She has a gorgeous voice that gets overpowered and LOST on some of these tracks. They KILLED OVER THE RAINBOW, her signature song. Its got the most obnoxious drum beat in it. It takes away from the beauty of her voice. Kimberly, you need a new producer. Rely on ur voice and NOT over production. But I wish you the best on your 2nd cd. cuz I do love your voice and wanted you to win AI2. Eight world wonder is great! But rest of cd is as simon would say... ""so what?"""
2,Great singer but not the greatest choice of songs,"Kimberley has a fantastic voice, but I don't think the producers chose appropriate songs for her. I can't say that I was disappointed but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. I look forward to hearing from Kimberley again and then posting a better review."
3,80 World Wonder with Kimberley,"The Album is okay. Some of the songs are great. And then some songs weren't, not to say I would buy any more of her albums in the future."
4,Wonderful singer!,"Kimberley Locke is a true vocalist with a powerful, beautiful and rich sound. Loved her different and soulful remake of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow."""
4,excellent,debut .. definitely up there with clay and kelly. i can't stand ruben (whose cd is overproduced). kimberley definitely shined on the show and shines on the cd. still trying to find her niche but a darn great cd to start with. she has a very hypnotic voice that is smooth and jazzy.
5,WOW = K-LO is Awesome!,"What a great CD...lots of kicky fun stuff, but I really love her ballads the most! The duet with Clay (Without You) is fabulous, as is the 8th track (Before). Kimberley has a marvelous voice with such depth and color to it! America Idol has given us some truly great singers and Kimberley is among the best! Go Girl!"
4,K-Lo!,"I was really impressed with K-Lo's growth throughout the AI competition. She really has a lot of power in her voice. Her debut is great, and I look forward to hearing more from her in the future. However, I don't feel that this album showed off her voice as much as it could have. Kimberly has a powerful voice, and I had the impression that she was holding back just a little on this album. Nevertheless, it was a great album. My favorite songs are Without you with Clay Aiken, 8th World Wonder, Coulda Been, Before, and I Could"
5,EVEN BETTER,what more can u say bout this singer.............she is sooooo great n she sings soooooooo nice love it i had to get this cd when it came out.....listen to it all the time
3,chaos princess,I think she is talented and has a nice voice i just do not particularly like her song choices in this cd.
4,WATCH OUT IDOLS...,this girl is amazing...truly one of the best of her season...the cd is quite entertaining in the first 5 songs...then gets less enthrawling in the last few songs...but is definetly worth the purchase after the first 5 songs...so enjoy...
4,Very good first CD!,"I really enjoyed this album. My opinion, ""8th World Wonder"" is the best song. Honestly, Kimberly Locke should have come in second place beating out Ruben. I give you four stars Kimberly! Your terrific!"
4,Awesome Album from Season 2 Finalist,"Kimberley may have only made third place in American Idol season 2, but her debut album is certainly a number 1!!! The twelve tracks show K-Lo's talent and versatility. She is comfortable doing uptempo songs as well as ballads. There is also a duet with her roommate and good friend, Clay Aiken.Kimberley will be making joyful music for years to come."
1,Pretty weak besides the single,"""8th World Wonder"" is easily the best single that's been released by an AI contestant. It's very catchy (though I didn't like the production of her voice. It almost like they synthesized her voice ala Cher). Anyways, it's a very good pop song.The rest of the CD is pretty weak, however. I was especially disappointed that two of the songs she's already sung on AI - ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" and ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" were included.It's not a horrible CD, but I wouldn't buy it. Locke came across as having a pretty abrasive and rude personality on the show, so I was hoping that her CD would show more warmth and tenderness - it didn't.The single is quite good, but I wouldn't spend any money for the CD."
1,Rush Job,"Kimberly has a beautiful voice, but didn't utilze her vocal range. The choices of songs (words) were absolutely terrible, but the ""music arrangements"" were good."
1,What happened Kim???,"Where is your beautiful voice? I am so disappointed, was really looking forward to hearing your voice from American Idol, I guess the recording voice is different! Bumbed out!!!"
1,"Overrated non-talent, like The Duck","Whoever thought that this girl could sing must be deaf! The girl is off-key mant times, can't sustain notes, and doesn't have a good quality singing voice. She's no different (though I must admit slightly better) than the other overrated AI contestant, Fantasia BORE-ino, who has no singing voice at all and resorts to squeaks and screams just to make it appear that she's singing.Non-talents like these should be banned from the music industry!"
2,Great singer -- insipid material,"Kimberly Locke is one of the most impressive American Idol finalists so far, with respect to vocal ability, sophistication, and artistry. Unfortunately, all these AI ""stars"" so far have been weighted down with song material that is ""original"", but is disappointingly pedestrian, lacking in melody or creativity. In other words, this CD is boring. With good material, Kimberly would shine. If the producers of these CD's can't come up with excellent songs, why not a least put a few established pop standards into the mix?"
4,Good for KLo!!!,"Kimberly Lock was one of my favorites on AI and her CD was okay. She is talented and so is Ruben and Clay. This review is for Kimberly's CD and not for bashing her for being overweight as someone said in a previous review. I notice the same person from High Point, Fantasia's home, who rated Tamyra's CD also made a comment about Fantasia's voice being like Donald Duck. She's your home town girl and I would think you would be proud. Do I detect some jealousy?"
2,Was expecting better,"Kim was my second favorite on the AI2 show right behind Clay Aiken. After listening to the whole album I can honestly say that I only like 2 songs, ""8th world wonder"" and ""Without you"". The only thing that made this cd worth the money is the ""Without you"" duet between Kim and Clay, this song is absolutely beautiful and their voices compliment each other. I hope Kim's next album is better. I will have to listen to it first before I purchase another."
3,Some Songs Good and Others OK,"Kimberley Locke's voice is great, but this being a debut album and all I'll cut her slack for for not always singing the songs that go well with her. I didn't like the first half of the CD, but towards the end things get good. I like that! I was starting to think this was going to be another AI turkey. If you don't mind skipping the middle part of CD, you may love this CD and Kimberley's rich voice."
5,Smooth transition...,"Surprisingly effective debut for AI2 contestant. Remaining true to her vocal command, Kimberly delivers a beuatiful mix of selections never trying to appear overwrought with her lovely voice."
1,"Overrated non-talent, like The Duck","Whoever thought that this girl could sing must be deaf! The girl is off-key many times, can't sustain notes, and doesn't have a good quality singing voice. She's no different (though I must admit she's slightly better) than the other overrated AI contestant, Fantasia BORE-ino, who has no singing voice at all and resorts to squeaks and screams just to make it appear that she's singing.Non-talents like these should be banned from the music industry!"
1,Terrible,Totally not what I expected from Kim! She went from this R&B soul-tress to BLAAAUUUGGGHHH ! C'mon girl you ain't no Nick Jr. performer. Get some soul in it!
1,Carbon Copy Much?,"I am AMAZED no one has pointed out the fact that ""Wrong"" by Kimberley Locke sounds EXACTLY like ""Miss Independent"" by Kelly Clarkson, both vocally and on the production/arrangement level. While I admit the arrangements in ""MI"" weren't exactly the most original ever (what pop song truly is, though?), the fact is Kimberley should find her own style instead of trying to sound like a bad clone of Kelly Clarkson."
3,She's ok...,"She is an ok singer and her album will sell some but she will never have the soul as Ruben, Fantansia, LaToya or Jennifer."
3,Some Gems,"This CD does have a few gems, I really like ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" and ""I Could"". The single is also very catchy and compared to a lot of singles on the radio it deserves the air time. The problem with some of this CD is it is overproduced and Kimberely's voice is lost. Also, there are no really great ballads. This is unfortunate because she really has an amazing voice and with the right ballads she could do something amazing. I can certainly hear a few more singles on this album, which is rare for a lot of artists. They have one single on an album of garbage. A good first effort, worth the money, I'm looking forward to more."
5,Love it,"ok.. i wasnt really her fan, but my friend bought it and i heard. after hearing it just once- i had to buy it- best AI album out yet..."
4,"Kimberley Locke ""One Love"" Review","Kimberley Locke's debut album is a must-have. A die-hard Clay Aiken fan, I just bought this CD for Clay's duet with Kimberley and to see how she did. I am so happy I did that. The entire CD is awesome. ""8th World Wonder"" is the PERFECT catchy pop song. ""Wrong"" is a great girl-power anthem to rock out to. Her duet ""Without You"" with Clay is absolutely beautiful. ""It's Alright"" and ""Coulda Been"" are both really catchy, with great beats. Whether you are a fan of American Idol or not, I definitely recommend you check out this album. Kimberley's vocals are great and every song shows she has what it takes to be a star."
3,"Decent, but dissapointed","i couldnt wait to buy kim's album. she was my fave on AI last year. i picked it up the first day it was out. listening to it, its not what i expected. i like pop, but i like r&b more, and i didnt here much of that. i was expecting that big voice with all its power and range to come out of her, and it didnt. however, she still sounds decent. kimberley cant ever sound bad!! my favorites are: ""its alright"", ""you've changed"", and ""now i can fly"". her version of ""cant make you love me"" is really good. ""somewhere over the rainbow"" was good, but she should've sang it more powerfully, like she did on the show."
3,Average Album from an Amazing artist,"Kimberly Locke is the second most talented artist to come off of AI. She definately has the vocal chops to be compared with the probably slightly more talented Fantaisa, however she, like Barrino has a streak of originality. And that is where this album suffers. Instead of the folky blues of her ""New York State Of Mind"" or ""I Can't Make You Love Me,"" which played down production and played up her hauntingly beautiful vocals, she goes for the generic overproduced muck that makes up so much of the mainstream today. And, unlke less talented AI grads like Josh Gracin, she doesn't need to rely on safe and boring."
1,"Bad, next only to Queen of Ghoul's CD in being horrible","I'm surprised that this formerly fat contestant who was rude to the judges was given the opportunity to record her own CD. I'm not suprised, though, that it's a flop. She, like Squeaky Idol Fantasia The Duck Barrino, is extremely overrated and should not be given any future in the music industry. She's better off in law school where she can exercise her talent at being obnoxious."
2,Wasted talent,"This young woman has a powerful voice and the potential for stardom. However this is a poorly produced album; and without exception the lyrics are amateurish at best, and in many cases, just silly. I was really disappointed, as I felt that towards the end of Season 2, Kimberley gave Rueben and Clay a run for their money. Let's hope she can get better guidance for her next effort."
4,Coulda Been is an awesome song!,"I listen to Without You and Coulda Been over and over! Unlike today's popular artists, at least you know the people who came from American Idol are truly singing and not depending on studio trickery to make them sound 'good'. That is why I recommend quite a few singers from the show. K-Lo is a great singer! She and Clay are my 2 faves. I am still waiting to get Carmen's CD. If you like real singers, try this CD out."
2,One Love by Kimberley Locke,"When I watched American Idol last season, I was floored by Kimberley Locke. She was an amatuer singer, but she had so much control & power to her vocals that you would think she was a seasoned veteran. Her debut album, One Love, is a great showcase of her incredible range & talent. While the vocals are always at their best, its the songs that need a great deal of work. ""Wrong"", which is HEAVILY influenced by Christina Aguilera's ""Fighter"", ""Have You Ever Been in Love"", ""Now I Can Fly"" & ""Coulda Been"" are prime examples of this, but the album isn't a complete flop. The first single, ""8th World Wonder"", is the best track by any of the American Idol finalists, and a cover of ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is fantastic. ""I Could"" and ""Before"" are also very good and my strong favorites for a second single. Get her better writers and tracks and she will have a tremendous future."
5,Fun and Catchy,"I don't care anything about the technicalities of music...good music to me is just something that is nice to listen to. That said, Kimberley Locke's CD is just that, nice to listen to. I love all of the songs on the CD and it has great replay value. Just a fun, pop CD!"
5,wealth of information,The book is more than an excellent cook book. Besides good cooking tips it has a lot of gastronomical information concerning Naples.
2,"Pretty, but None Too Useful","I think this is a charming, well written, informative book that has many, many merits, however its chatty nature makes it almost impossible to use as a cookbook. It appears to be a coffee-table book haphazardly studded with recipes. If you like your cookbooks to be carefully selected collections of clear, easy-to-follow instructions, steer clear of this book; it's not for you."
5,Lemoncello recipe worth the price of admission,"Thoroughly liked this book. Not only great recipes, but written with wit and great story telling. Just the two recipes for Italian Liqueurs, strawberry, LIQUORE DI FRAGOLE and lemon, LEMONCELLO, are worth the price of the book. I was served Lemoncello in Italy last year and was so impressed with it I brought some back with me. Well! Let me tell you, Arthur's recipe, while so simple, ""KNOCKS THE SOCKS"" off the bottled stuff I carted back. Arthur Schwartz proves with this book that good Italian cooking doesn't require you to slave over a hot stove or in a hot kitchen all day. His BOCCONCINI DI RANA PESCATRICE ALLA MEDITERRANEAN, (Chunks of Monkfish, Mediterranean-Style) takes longer to say than to cook. And it is wonderful. I have a lot of cookbooks, and love using them. This one will be always find its way to the top of the heap."
5,A sonic boom for your buck,"A sweet little drive for 10 bucks.fast,light,looks cool.the company even send's you a pack of smarties!Nice drive for someone looking for a relieable,inexpensive flash drive to store and transfer data."
5,~Excellent Product,"At an excellent price! Tiny 1GB holds a lot of music, pictures and documents. Just click & drag. Fast data transfer speed. Super-easy to use. Lanyard keeps it at the ready."
4,Great product!,"Our office received 5 of the Trancend 1 GB Jetflash V30. We purchased them to use with our digital photo receivers. We were searching for a small, discreet flash drive that wouldn't stick out of the side of the frame too much. The product was smaller than we hoped for and worked great. Everyone in our office was very pleased with the time it took to receive the drives, the look of the drives and how well they worked. If we need more in the future we will choose this product."
5,As advertised. I have a USB port in my truck's radio. I bought three of these. They do exactly what they are supposed to do.,"I got three of the little drives. I have moved files with them, but I purchased them to be able to provide different libraries of music for the radio in my truck. If the manufacturers read this, I would have liked a simple, inexpensive string for carrying it around my neck, but I am bright enough to figure that out on my own. Just saying . .When I read reviews, I'm looking for someone to tell me the product worked or didn't work . . was worth it . . or was not. These worked and continue to work. They are way inexpensive. I do not know for sped . . fast or slow; I know that I plug them into my computer, drop the MP3 files on them I want to hear, plug the unit into the USB port in my radio, and listen."
5,An Essential Dance Single,"Que Pasa?You ask I say muy represent...this song is of da hook,straight mix of traditional latino soul funk,tweeked with strong Afrocuban rhythmic spice with a background bass that will have your heart skipping to the beat of the Orishas(one of the most influential Latino Rap Groups.Catch the phat remix(lotsa maracas & marimbas,lotsa salsa beats,lotsa fun)...get this one senors and especially you senoritas this is bound to get you grooving and release that Latina within you!"
2,"Good Analysis, But No Summary!","These Cliffs Notes provide no summary, but only an analysis for the book. It is very hard to follow if you have not read the book, which is the whole point of Cliffs Notes!"
1,Not KitchenAid Quality,"I got this cooker to replace one that started to burn in one spot. The lid rocked on the crock, and didn't come anywhere close to sealing. Turns out the lid was fine, it's the crock that was warped. I exchanged one for another, and had the very same thing happen. I returned that one also, and went to a local kitchen store where I could check it myself before making the purchase. I had to go with the stainless finish, but at least it seals."
3,Simply Wonderful....till the pot cracked!,"I've owned several other slow cookers, but nothing that is as terrific as the KitchenAid! Wonderful settings, cooks like dream, and is in a class all by itself. I could write a book about how much I love this slow cooker, but instead I'll simply say, you won't be disappointed! It is well worth the cost (and yes, it's a little pricey), but once you have seen and used it, you'll understand the difference between the Kitchen Aid and every other slow cooker out there. Sorry to have to add this, but about a week after the warranty expired, the pot cracked and leaked sauce all over my kitchen counter. Bought a $300 All Clad and it's not nearly as nice, plus the scratch resistant coating is now peeling off. Think I'll try the Crockpot SCVT650-PS, since it has good reviews here on Amazon."
3,Crock Crack,"So far in the almost two years I have owned this slow cooker, I have gone through two crocks in it. Both of the crocks I have had have cracked. Once while cooking spaghetti in it and once while doing a pot roast. I still rated this a 3 because of several things. The price was really great, the heater controls are really nice, the timer is nice and Kitchen Aid has been really good about replacing the crocks both times I have called (both times were out of warranty). I really hope the 3rd time is the charm and the crock I receive does not crack."
2,Great customer service doesn't make up for terrible quality control,"For me, the strong KitchenAid name justified the higher price tag of this slow cooker. However, the unit I received cracked upon first use. The replacement model I was sent had a overly warped ceramic pot (far more than lid-pot gap you expect from a slow cooker). The third and fourth models both cracked after the first few uses (I always followed directions and only used the low setting for the 8 hour recipes). The only upside is that the customer support from KitchenAid is first rate. I supposed if you've got time on your hands to deal with mailing cookers back then there is little risk in this purchase but for me it was a big pain..."
3,Cracked ceramic pot,"KitchenAid KSC700GC 7-Quart Slow Cooker, Gloss Cinnamon RedOur slow cooker arrived with a cracked ceramic pot. Could not detect it at first. It leaked down on to the heating unit. 30 days had passed before we figured out the problem. A hassle. But Amazon gave us a full refund for the defective product. Yeah, Amazon !"
1,Cracked Crock,"Hairline crack along bottom of ceramic pot after only a dozen uses. Should have checked reviews before purchase like I usually do. After reviewing other comments on this product stating kitchen aid replacements also cracked, will just take the loss and try another brand."
5,Best of the Best,"The nutrition isn't the highest of all I've tried, but it's dang close. The fiber content isn't the highest, but it's dang close. The taste of these particular bars isn't the absolute best, but it's awfully close to the far less healthy bars. I think I prefer the Almond flavored ones even more, and their taste is unbeatable, PLUS they're healthy (green wrapper ILO yellow). To take a quick breakfast on the run, or just get a nutritious, fiber-filled snack, I recommend these Kashi bars far and away more than Fiber One, Kellogs, Quaker, Luna (yes, I know I'm not supposed to eat Lunas), Clif, Special K and Carnation, and probably a half-dozen others I can't remember that I've tried because I only tried them once ... I think Kellogg's Smart Choice cereal would do well against these bars nutritionally, but the bars win the taste category, hand's down. I buy these in boxes of 24 of each flavor, Peanut, Chocolate Chip, and Almond from Sam's Club now. They rock!"
3,won't order again,"I was looking for a replacement for Odwalla Chocolate Chip Peanut bars and tried these. I'd go back to the Odwalla Bars in a flash which have whole peanuts and whole choc chips. These bars are more like stale rice cripsy bars with a chocolate coated bottom. They are very hard (i.e. like they are stale)and do not have much of a peanut taste. Besides, they have too high a percentage of soy, but I was desperate (sigh)."
3,Kashi bars,"The Kashi bars were okay. I don't know that I would buy them again, especially in that quantity. The chocolate on the bottom was nice. Very whole grain, healthy tasting."
5,Great bar,One of my all time favorite bars. I can eat these every day and not get tired of them. YUM
1,BARN FLAVOR,"For name and appearance this bar should receive a five, but what really counts is taste, this I can only describe as barn flavors which gives it a minus 100. As far as the chocolate and caramel flavors you could see them but the taste sure was not. I had other people try them, I couldn't even give them away."
3,Decent Bars,"+Taste is good+Price is good-These upset my stomach if I have more than one-""Healthy"" in comparison to other products, but not really healthy.These bars are good for a quick snack if you don't have fresh food available, but let's face it even Kashi adds a lot of artificial ingredients to keep the flavor and preservation."
4,Very Tasty Protein Bars,I am not a big fan of most protein bars but have found several Kashi varieties that are very good. Way too expensive on Amazon though. Target sells these loose for a buck and a quarter. I usually pick up a few of these and the Oatmeal Raisin rolls whenever I stop there.
4,Yummy,"These are wonderful snack bars... lot's of fiber, chocolate, and caramel. It doesn't get too much better than that. I held off a star, though, because they are a little too sweet for me. Otherwise, they are awesome."
4,Kashi Bars,Bought these for my 17 year old. He loves them. Saves them for after a work out. Very filling. Great deal thru Amazon.
5,Great quick and easy breakfast,"I am a big fan of Kashi foods in general, but these bars are my absolute favorite. I love the crunchy/chewy texture, and the chocolate peanut flavor is really good and not too sweet. They remind me of a healthier version of home-made Special K bars (kind of like a peanut butter Rice Krispie bar with chocolate on top)."
5,"Good Flavor, Good Nutrients...Go Lean!","Protein, fiber, low in calories, high in taste...that's what Kashi brings to the ""power bar"" market. These are old concepts that have never been fully executed: Most bars on the market lack one of these crucial elements. Surprisingly, Kashi hits a home run with the ""Go Lean"" crunchy, chocolate peanut bar. Highly recommended!"
2,Kashi cereals are great - the snack bar is only fair,I really like the Kashi cereals and thought I'd try their snack bars. Not so good. Doesn't have the magic the cereal does. Maybe its too sweet.
5,I love these,I love these bars and buy them all the time.But I just noticed that Amazon no longer has nutrition information easily available.What is up with that ?
5,Taste great,"I bought these as a way to supplement my meals, as well as get more fiber and protein. First of all, these bars are fairly nutritious. They are made of natural ingredients and whole grains, just like the cereal. Each bar contains 6g of fiber and 9g of protein. Considering most people in the United States don't get enough fiber, that is a very decent amount. Previously I was eating the Fiber One Bars Oats & Chocolate, 5-Count Boxes (Pack of 6). While you get 3g more fiber in those bars, you only get 2g of Protein. The Kashi bars are made of better (and more nutritious) ingredients, and they taste better as well. Each bar has only 180 calories, but they are very filling due to the fiber and protein.Although a bar made of brown rice and oats doesn't sound very tasty, these are some of the best bars I've tried. As the name implies, they're not chewy, but not too crunchy either. Below is the main nutritional info:Calories 180Total Fat 5gSat fat 2gSodium 250mgCarbs 30gFIBER 6gPROTEIN 9g"
5,Even my 3 yr olds will eat this!,"This flavor has less calories than some of the others, and is a bit like a rice crispy treat with a layer of chocolate.Lighter tasting than other bars and still 9g protein, 6g fiber and 20% calcium.A nice, healthy, quick snack for the whole family."
2,terrible game-terrible movie,"Wow this is bad, was my first reaction after about 3 min. of play. It was a gift, i didn't want it!! It is soooo bad. It is a teriible fighter with a terrible story and terrible graphics, lets leave it at that. Don't buy it!!"
1,TERRIBLE GAME,"terrible story,terrible game play,terrible characters,TERRIBLE GAME OVERALL!i wouldn't wish this game upon my enemies!if you buy this game,you're better off wiping your ass with the $ used to get this!DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Bluetooth didn't work and software isn't Mac compatible,"When I received my phone, the battery was defective. I ordered a replacement battery but still could not pair the phone to anything (I have plenty of experience with bluetooth pairing). Top it all off with the fact that the software only works on Windows, my only option to load phonebook entries into this phone would be manual entry. The interface of the flip phone was something out of the 1990s -- kludgy and childish. The available ring tones are from the same generation. Aside from the technical problems that I encountered, I thought this was a pretty lousy phone."
2,Uniden ELBT585 5.8 GHz,"Cool looking physically but the software interface is worse than anything I have ever seen. It is not intuitive nor well-designed. Symbols and menus are confusing and downright ugly. Very poorly executed. It's as if the folks at Uniden don't even own cell-phones so they have no experience in interfacing with a phone that can manage contacts and play messages. Otherwise it functions well, battery life is good. No interference with my wireless network, which is one of the main reasons I bought it.I am afraid I cannot recommend this phone - you can spend less and get a LOT better elsewhere, even within Uniden's other 5.8 GHz products, where they don't experiement with cellphone-like GUIs on your dime."
1,Not good.,I did not have good luck with these. They consistently broke in my marker and I did not end up shooting the whole box.
2,Bad,"these sucked. when i first opened them and looked at them, i saw that they werent round,: alot were oblong and they diddnt flly strait. the only good thing is i only had one barrel break out of 500"
4,THESE PAINTBALLS ARE AWESOME,"these paintballs are good . they work good wit m y ,marker and they hav nevr broken in the barrell"
2,hard to read,I am very interested in connective tissue and myofascia and how it works in the body ... but I am finding this book a difficult read.
4,Great view of connective tissue as a physical structure,"Before I read this book I had never really considered the functioning of connective tissue as a ""web-like"" structure within which bone and muscle articulate. The authors contend, starting with embrionic anatomy and onward, that the c.t. forms a bed within which cells differentiate. From this view point of c.t. being a primary base for physical form, we are shown how all parts of the web are connected, and create ""bands"" that ideally are nether too tight or too loose. I didn't know much about Rolfing either, but apparently this bodywork deals specificly with c.t. Good book, great publishing company."
4,Great book,I just got this book and have reccommended it to a friend LMT and she also bought the book recently. If your wanting to read more on Myofascial and its effects on the body this book will be a good read
2,Not quite what you will be expecting,"I originally bought this book hoping to learn more about the so-called ""poison widows."" What I got was a book that devotes more than two thirds of its pages to the trial. There is alot of extra info about the lawyers in this case that I really didn't think helped the flow of this book.The author only briefly delves into what life was like back in the early part of the century. There is even briefer mention about the women's lives. You are told in passing that some of the men beat their wives, for instance.The main portion of the book, the trial, isn't told very well either. I understand that there were alot of women that went to trial, but most of them get a few pages. Two of the trial lawyers get more coverage than most of these women.Overall, more of a general synopsis of what happened than anything with real depth."
4,More Than Funny,"Destro effectively mixes wit and slapstick in his first novel, Rooster Dreams. I giggled my way through the whole book. But there is more to this work than humor. The underlying theme of the book is about imprisonment- physical and mental (the main character is not only trapped in a prison cell or trapped in his desires, he's trapped in the pages of a curious novel!). If this subject interests you in the least, you will be pleasently surprised by Destro's many examinations of the matter. I highly recomend it!"
2,get the locking nozzle,"These nozzles leak if you place your bag on top of them or even bend over, it pinches it. This nozzle constantly leaks all our water out, soaks our bag and pisses us off. Our other bags have the locking one which is much better. The best nozzle I have used was some no name brand bag. You had to bite between two solid cylinders. That was great. The quality of rubber is good of course so it gets 2 stars... but seriously, get the locking one. You have been warned."
3,Bruce lee so so game,"It is your basic beat um up.. not much else to say, fun at first then gets boring. Try streets of rage 2 its basicaly the same kind of game but much better."
1,didn't work,"this thing didn't work the second it came out of the package. It could've been a fluke, but who wants to take chances? Try a belkin it works very well."
5,Adidas Running Shoes are GREAT!!!,"I LOVE these shoes they are worth every penny I paid for them. Great price also, I should have ordered two pair."
5,Fabulous,"Great DVD. If you love Brazil, play guitar or just want to see great music and great musicians buy it. I noticed Ze Paulo Becker and Yamandu Costa because I am interested in guitar. worth seeing both. Just a really enjoyable film."
4,"Great Information, good resource.","This is a really interesting book and I enjoyed reading it. As someone working in this field I am familiar with other work like this but there is simply not enough of it. I was happy to discover this fascinating book about the history of lesbians in England. I would love the authors to write one from 1970 to the present. Angela Brinskele Director of Communications, The Mazer Lesbian Archives"
1,"Paging Dr.Smith, Paging Dr. Smith...","Why paging Dr. Smith? - Well primarily because I used this product on my sliding glass doors and now my den looks like it leads to the Emergency Room. I think the rice paper needs more contrast between the white background and the flecks. Overall I am not happy with the outcome, as this product makes the doors look pale and unattractive. Note: You will also need two people for any product like this (not just this one) so make sure someone is available to help."
3,"A Bit Too Confusing, this one.","I found this book a little confusing, and it did not ring true in a lot of areas. For example, picturing Alfred Hitchcock as a devil-may-care spy for England. The relish that he displayed when faced with murder and kidnapping is certainly not the picture that I have of him in my mind. This book is quite different than The Dorothy Parker Murder Case which is the only other book of Baxt's that I've read so far. This was a spy story set just before the beginning of the Second World War. Maybe my assessment of the book has been tainted by the fact that I just finished reading Eric Ambler's ""A Coffin for Dimitrios"" - a spy story set about the same time as this one was. ""Coffin"" was a masterpiece, and this one just seemed a little inane. It is still quite funny in spots, and Hitch had a great sense of humour, and that shows up over and over in the book. Not bad for a romp."
4,I read about PUNK in a book...,"""Hey! Ho! Let's go!"" While this isn't the first book I've read about punk rock, it is by far the best and most complete! I love this book! Not since Joan Jett sweat on me in a mosh pit have I had such a meaningful punk rock moment as I had the first time I plowed through this book. The author brought back major memories for me, but he also made me realize that yes, even *I* still have a lot to learn about punk and punk culture. My second reading was even better because I covered myself in pig's blood first. I would have given this book 5 stars but there's not enough stuff about the Plaster Commandoes and Ditchwitch. Awesome!"
5,Comparable to Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Sauce and way cheaper!,"I am a huge fan of the Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte which is a seasonal item. I don't get to Starbucks every day and, let's face it, I'm not thrilled at shelling out $4.50 or so for their PSL. I've been able to find listings for the Starbucks PS Sauce on auction sites, but the prices range from about $40 on up once all is said and done. I ordered this product and it arrived quickly. I now make my own Pumpkin Spice Lattes at home - they taste great - and I can have them every day!Highly recommended...."
1,Da Vinci creamer,I did not like it at all. Tasted to much like maple syrup and it was toooo sweet. I wanted the taste of the pumpkin spice that Starbucks has in there drink. I gave the stuff away.
3,"Good, yet needs more refining","The book is a wonderful start for beginners. However, one of the drawbacks is that it provides the user with letter notes (C,D,E,F..) till the end of book. This style does not benefit the user to play notes by seeing the symbols on the staff, rather they become accustomed to reading the notes by seeing the letters."
2,it's on ... it's off,"When I first used this oven at work, I want to own one just like that. After a long search,I was so excited when I finally found one at Amazon, even if it's remanufactured unit. The downfall for settling for a remanufactured unit is that it's not perfect. The unit that I got shutdowns on its own in the middle of cooking/baking, especially if it was accidentally notched or if it felt a vibration from other sources (like closing of the cabinet door or cupboards or maybe earthquake). So for the unit at work, I would give it 5 stars but for the unit that I got, I will only give it a 2 1/2 stars."
4,Great book for the very young,"This is a very simple book which is great for very young children. My only complaint would be that it does not explain why children look for the Afikomen, or explain any of the objects it shows (Elijah's cup, the Haggadah, etc.) But this book does interest my 1 year old son. He seems to understand that it is fun and exciting to search for something, and follows the search in the book avidly. I would say that this story is best for the very young, and for older children, you may want a book that is more ""in depth"" about Pesach."
4,A real page turner!,"This was a very good book. Once I started reading it I couldn't put it down, I read it in less than a day. The concept of crossed worlds is nothing new, but Garrison did a great job in making the other world. ""The Castle"" world is very unique and it's government's structure is very intersting. I can't wait for book 2!"
3,Original,This book was very original and kept me turning the pages. And yet I found it very boring. But I'm still reading the series (on book 3 now). This book takes too long setting up the story. There are so many characters that the full story its not that long. I think the writer has A.D.D.. But at the same time I am left wanting to know how the story is going to end. The next two books in the series are better.
4,A Decent Fantasy Novel,"The best and worst thing about The Changeling War is the fact that it is the first book in a new series called the Changeling Saga. Best because there will be more, worst because we have to wait for more. TCW is written in a straight forward fashion.The Changeling War is a fantasy that combines our ""real"" world with a classic fantasy world. It does this seamlessly. When the story moves from one world to the other, it does not detract from the story. The characters are very well fleshed out.The plot is well done. It is not simple despite the straight forward writing style. The mystery of how the two worlds relate and the various quests make this novel a real page turner. This is the first book of a series so it is only a beginning.This is a great book for both the experienced fantasy reader and for someone who hasn't read fantasy before. The tie in to our world and the writing style make it great for someone who might be afraid of traditional fantasy."
1,The worst sci-fantasy book I have ever read,"I have read many many books in my lifetime. The genre of sci-fantasy is definately my favorite. I read this book, and the 2 previous books in the last 3 weeks. They had to be the worst books I have read, ever. The characters were undeveloped, to get to care about a character you need to know more than their name and their profession. You need details to really feel that they are alive. Also, a better editing process would have been good, their were names mispelled from one sentence to the next (Kedrik/Kedric) and other times when the wrong character name was used in dialogue. I think the author has potential, I just hope he can live up to it someday."
2,it has not the same look,"shape of my case is exactly what I have seen on the photos while ordering it, but NOT the LINE on it. there are big geometric shapes that change the overall colour of the case (and unfortunately it looks cheap), which I did not like."
4,Does the job great.,Just exactly as described. Fits in my pocket and keeps the dust off the buds and keeps them from getting tangled up. Would recommend.
3,Smaller than I thought,"I knew it was small but I didnt expect it to be this small. Furthermore, the package was a day late."
3,Not quite big enough for my purposes.,"This works great for the earbuds. But, I wanted it to be big enough to hold the charger, too. So, it works great for what it was designed to do. I wanted it for travel."
5,Love It!,"I am so glad I purchased this item. It keeps my earbuds out of harms way, makes them easy to find and they are never tangled! I also use the other half for my iPhone cord. I am really happy with this purchase."
4,"Small, but gets the job done","Its smaller than it looks, i was expecting something the size of my palm (and i have small hands), but its actually a little bigger than a coke can in diameter. Which means I have to wind up my headphones tighter than I'd like to. But other than that its really tough so if your headphones need protecting (not to mention i put my shuffle in there too) then its a good little case for it."
2,Uncomfortable,I found these ear buds to be very uncomfortable. I have a Bluetooth headset with a similar in-ear piece but don't have any issue with it. I just could not find any of the different size ear gels that fit right.
5,Ear Buds of the Gods,"Finally, a pair of these inexpensive earphones and they do't fallout everytime I move. The small set of soft covers keeps them in my ears and have a nice noise reduction quality. I love these! The case is quite nice and sturdy. I am very pleased with both items."
4,Good Buy,"These ear buds are very good quality for the price. They are very comfortable. My only caviat is be very careful not to let them anywhere near water...don't drop in puddle, like I did. I'm on my second pair."
2,Expensive for its size.,The product is well made but expensive for its size - only big enough for 1 set of ear phones. I tried to put in 2 sets and a splitter but it was not big enough. That may be great for those who only want to carry 1 set - just didn't work for me.
1,Amazon selling USED items as new--again!,"Third time in two months that Amazon has sent me something that is supposedly new in an opened, scotch-taped package! This is outrageous and I am getting sick of it. I waited since mid-January for this. I waited patiently. Imagine my disappointment to find a used ear buds case in a broken up package. Gee ma! Just what I wanted! An earbuds case with someone else's ear wax in it! YUCK Shame on Amazon. They did this with two sets of expensive outdoor speaker that I ordered recently too. They're getting as bad a Fry's."
3,Small,"Product is as advertised, but it turns out to be quite small and the ear buds need to be wound very tight to get them to stay in as you zip it shut. In fact, I have purchased a larger size to avoid damaging the wires."
4,Great product,nice size for keeping in purse. actually holds two sets of headphones. keeps them untangled from each other and otherthings within my purse.
2,only OK,"The case is sturdy and looks good. I think it will last a long time, had it a week now. The logo on the top of the case rises about an 1/8 inch above the case so makes it catch when I try to slide it in my bag or pocket. The most disappointing is the buds don't go in easily. You still have to wind them up and shove them in the case. Long time ago I bought cheap $4.95 ear buds to get through a flight. They came in a hard plastic case, puck shaped like this one. The difference was that case had a molded slot in the middle for each bud then you simply wound the cord around the puck and it closed in on itself. I'm going to look for that case instead."
5,Nice!,"Earbuds Travel Case for JLab JBuds, PinkCute and convenient item and great to protect your earbuds in your purse or backpack etc. It also matched the earbuds and my Kindle Fire case perfectly!"
4,Nice Case,This is a handy case for traveling with my Kindle Ear Buds. It is easy to spot in my handbag and is attractive. And it certainly is pink! Delivered fast and reasonable price
3,Does the job and no more,"This is a case for my earphonesThe size is of a small stoneThe zipper is mediocreAt least it's black and no ocherPros: The case is quiet small, cushioned, and has a zipper.Cons: Kinda bulky in a sense that it's a funny shape (rather it be more flat), and the zipper is OK, it can catch on itself sometimes.But I'd buy it again cuz it's cheap."
5,Love this case,This case is exactly what I expected -- it's cute and it is a great solution for keeping my ear buds in a safe place.
4,Just what I needed,"My headphones were always getting damaged. Either the dog got them, they tangled into knots, or they fell into the abyss of my briefcase. This perfect little case fits my headphones and additional ear buds. I can drop it right into my briefcase, and grab it easily without having to fish around. Harder case seems to hold up better. Love the pink!"
2,Shoddy construction,"Earbuds Travel Case for JLab JBuds, blue. The earbuds do fit, and it is an OK case to carry them in, but the construction of the case is shoddy at best. The zipper is glued on by hand, as it goes from low on one side to high on the other, one side is loose the other side is so tight, sooner or later the zipper will separate, making the case useless. I gave 2 stars because of its short life expectancy."
5,JLab Ear Buds,"WOW, what a great bargain. Nice zipper case with a space for an SD Card or other small items (like the two extra sizes of ear bud covers). I would certainly purchase these comfortable earphones again."
4,Earbud Case,"The case is excellent for not only earbuds, placed in the mesh holder under the lid, but one can also put a small download or recharge cord in the main part of the interior (non-mesh covered) section. I use it this way and carry it in my pocket for my iPhone. Unfortunately, is is rather bulky for pants pocket, so is better used as directed as a carrying case for purses, suitcases, and briefcases. It's soft nature does allow for a little compression, yet is stiff enough for good protection of its contents."
2,Too small for most earbuds,I have some Shure earphones and there's no way they would be able to fit in this thing. I should've considered the size rather than looking at the pictures.
4,Earbuds Travel Case,"I purchased this case as a Gift for my Daughter along with some other thing. They were receeived on time as promised, well packaged and in good shape ... I know she has used it and has not complained about anything. I bought this model because it was for a Female and would go in her hand bag or jacket pocket with no problems So this is about all I can trufully say aat this time...Flay"
4,Necessary,"The EarBuds case is necessary to keep the extra ""buds"" in and the original ipod earphones."
4,Too big,I thought this was a little big for a pair of earphones. The color wasn't very vibrant and the logo makes it hard to see the case because it is so big (the logo). But it has a hard case so when you stash it in your purse or pocket (if you can fit it there) it won't crush.
3,Nice way to store Jbuds - but should be included instead of separate!,The travel case is a nice way to store your Jbuds - but should be included instead of sold separately!
4,earbuds case,"This case does just what it is suppose to. It carries earbuds and there cords in a neat easily contained package, also has room for extra earbud covers. For the price it delievers a good service"
3,Funtional,"For what this case is, it's really fine and it protects my headphones well. I used to have another case that would wind up my headphones sort of like a fishing reel. I would greatly prefer that style case if I could find one that fit my headphones."
4,Great Little Case,"I lost the case for my Shure earbuds and needed a replacement. I tried to buy the Shure replacement case and it wasn't available anymore, so I did a fair amount of looking around and finally settled for this one. It would be nice if it had a hub to reel the cable around, but it's not that big of a deal. It does the job."
1,The worst,I would give it ZERO Stars if possible. I really wanted this DVD player for my kids. I mean I really wanted it. It sounds great. You can use it in the car. It has built in games. It has a battery. It comes with AC/DC plug in. It plays CD's. It claims to be made to withstand use by kids. My problem...AFTER TRYING FOUR UNITS...(NONE)OF THEM WORKED. NOT ONE EVEN STARTED TO PLAY A DVD. I TRIED MULTIPLE DVDs. THEY ALL WORKED IN MY HOME DVD PLAYER. THEY ALL WORKED IN MY OLD COBY DVD PLAYER. NOT ONE WORKED IN THIS RCA PLAYER. AFTER HOURS OF EFFORT OVER MORE THAN THREE WEEKS....I GAVE UP. FOUR PLAYERS...NOT ONE WORKED. RCA...Can you say...QUALITY CONTROL.
1,TERRIBLE ITEM--BAD SERVICE,"I purchased this item and the audio cord to output to TV did not work. Tried it in two TVs. Sent it back at my cost; was returned ""fixed"" and connector cord still did not work. Company never responded to emails from distributor to fix problem again. Then unit started mysteriously returning to ""read"" mode during play process. Started off being anytime you moved the unit; then just starting doing it spontaneously. Had purchased an extended warranity through another company so am returning it for refund but am out $30 in shipping costs. Will not purchase another RCA product again."
5,Matapatta-yay!,"Listening to this music makes me happy. After discovering Matapat onThe Rough Guide to Canada, I decided to try one of their CDs, so 'Petit fou' is my first Matapat CD -- and I was hooked after the first few songs.Take a listen to:Un P'tit Soulier, MadamePar Un Dimanche Au SoirCharmante Sylvie - Pont De VieLa Jolie Rochelle...Though all the songs are melodic, with good soft beats, and nice lyrics (well, I don't really speak much French, but it sounds nice).In addition to Matapat I would recommend Dany Brillant, the Radio Folklore collection, and Equation. Matapat's folkish style with the variety of instruments is easy on the ear, pleasant to listen to, and it makes me want to dance. I look forward to trying more of their music!"
2,Haven't I heard this story somewhere before?,"The overall story was good, however Ms. Dodd extracted some very obvious plot plans from the movie Sabrina. In all actuality, the book is better than the movie Sabrina(the remake), but I would have liked it to be a more original topic."
3,"Plagiarism, but well-written","While I'm disturbed by Ms. Dodd's unattributed use of the movie Sabrina's romance-plot, she knit in suspense complications and did her usual job of fine writing. Once I got over my pique and dispite being able to anticipate most of the steps in the love story, I enjoyed the book. I only hope that in the future, when Ms. Dodd ""borrows"" elements of someone else's work, she will acknowledge to whom her thanks are due."
3,disappointing,"I wish I had read Harriet's review before buying this book. I loved the rest of the Governess bride and Bar Cynster series from Chrisinta Dodd, so I was really looking forward to reading it. But, when I suddenly found myself reading a remake of Sabrina, I found myself exceedingly disappointed. Sabrina is one of my all-time favorite movies, and in my opinion, this 'remake' does not do it justice."
2,SABRINA KNOCK-OFF,"IT'S MASSIVE PLAGARISM, FROM THE PLOT TO CHARACTERS. A HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT AND LACK OF ORIGINALITY AND CREATIVITY."
1,Same as Sabrina,"I normally enjoy Ms. Dodd's work, but in reading her newest work I'd have to say that I'm surprised that it was even published. The entire book, including characters and story line, follow the tale of both the old and newer version of the film Sabrina. How could any editor with any sense allow this book to be let out on the shelves when it is as close to plagarism as one can get without copying the tale, word for word. Although I was very disappointed in this work, I love all of Ms. Dodd's previous books, so I will continue to look forward to her next offering and hope for a more imaginative tale."
1,romantic plagiarism,"I actually enjoyed the romance in this story very much. The novel gets one star because it's not an original story, but a rewrite of another author's work. In fact the book is an exact copycat story of the 1954 film ""Sabrina"" starring Humphrey Bogart and the 1995 remake with Harrison Ford. The movie and book are the same except in the movie her father was the chauffeur. Still it's a beautiful story. Her father is an employee of a very rich family. Celeste (and in the movie she was called Sabrina) has always watched and had a crush on the younger brother, Ellery. She goes away to school and becomes polished and returns hoping to have Ellery fall in love with her. The older brother, Garrick (who is in charge of the business and considered a ruthless businessman) notices and romances the girl himself to keep her away from his brother. And of course falls in love. The characters are good and the story is romantic. Very light hearted romance but the original movie is better."
4,A Very Nice Dream,This was my first read in Dodd's Governess Series and I was not disappointed. The SABRINA-esque storyline is apparent from the first few chapters yet the characters themselves and the regency setting kept my interest. The author also adds an underlying spy intrigue for some suspense in between the sizzling love scenes. All of the characters in this novel make up an excellent ensemble and the writing has them interacting and behaving in very believable ways. This was an enjoyable read which got me hooked to learn more about Dodd's other governesses!
1,In My Wildest Dreams,"Very very disappointed in Christina for plagiarizing the movie Sabrina. I liked the movie (both of them). When I read a book I want to vision my own characters or from the cover, I don't want to vision the characters in a movie. If I could give her negative stars I would have given her a negative-[...] It must have taken her an hour to compose this book - search and replace names and a few minor edits from the movie script. DONOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Wish I had read the reviews first!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Red ALert!!! Sabrina re-write ahead. If you want to read ""Sabrina"" after seeing the movie go ahead. I was so disappointed. Did the author get sued for plagarism??? I usually love Ms Dodd's work - so I just bought the book. I couldn't even finish it. I have been wary about the Governess Brides series. Now I don't think I will read any."
2,Romance by Numbers,"I was about four chapters in when I realized that this book was a blatant, note for note rip-off of the Billy Wilder movie ""Sabrina"", with Bogart and Hepburn. While the story is one that I absolutly love, I found that by knowing exactly how the book was going to turn out (and every turn along the way) made for a more than predictable read. I am used to Dodd captivating us with strong heroines and alpha heros that, while we know all will be well in the end, take us on a ride that is funny,touching,and suprising, leaving us unable to put the book down. I only finished this book by force, hoping that she would somehow put in a suprise ""whammy"" somewhere along the way. Alas, no whammy. I look foward to her next book but I wish I had left this one on the shelf. (If you have never seen or heard of ""Sabrina"", disregard this entire review!)"
1,Didn't even finish it....,"This was my first Christina Dodd book and a major disappointment. I didn't care for any of the characters or the spy subplot. And I don't enjoy reading about how my leading man, hopefully an alpha male, is so close to his mommy that he tells her everything -- even that he's just confirmed that his young governess is truly a virgin. I took this one back to the library without even finishing it. Thank goodness I didn't pay for it!"
2,Move away from the VCR!,"I see from other reviewers that I am not the only one who has noticed that Christina Dodd has watched ""Sabrina"" a few too many times. Unfortunately, unlike others, I do not see this novel as an ""homage"", but rather outright copying. I realize that there are few truly original plots left in the world, but the first half of this book borrows so heavily from the movie that I can almost see the stage directions in the margins of the script, excuse me, text. Since I was on vacation and didn't have another book with me, I slogged through to the end and ended up being mildly entertained. However, I have come to expect much better from Christina Dodd and hope that whatever publishing house deadline demands led to this heavy-handed plot borrowing do not present a similar problem in the future."
2,"I know it's a ""homage"" to Sabrina but...","I didn't know from the book's cover jacket that this is the author's homage to Sabrina but it takes less than five pages to grasp the concept. However, because it mirrored ""Sabrina"" so closely I found it very difficult to separate these characters (in my mind) from the modern day movie characters. The process became so disruptive to just enjoying the flow of the book that I finally just gave up and tossed the book aside. I'm so disappointed because I always enjoy Ms. Dodd's books. Hopefully the next book will be an original work which is what I, as the reader, expect."
3,"The new ""Sabrina""","Christina Dodd tells a sweet, humourous love triangle as the 4th book in her Governess series. This book is a quick, pleasant read. However, if you've ever watched the movie ""Sabrina"" you'll find yourself reliving it frequently in this book."
1,An extreme disappointment,The publisher's oversight in including a disclaimer about the book's homage to Sabrina is unfortunate. Ms. Dodd's lack of originality is regrettable. One would be better served to read the movie script; better entertained to rent the video--the original.
2,Strangely boring.,"Even though I have enjoyed the other Governess romances AND ""Sabrina"" is one of my all-time faves (the Audrey Hepburn version of course), I found this book strangely boring and disappointing. I hope the next one is more entertaining."
2,Romance by Numbers,"I was about four pages in when I realized that this book was a blatant, note for note rip-off of the Billy Wilder movie ""Sabrina"", with Bogart and Hepburn. While the story is one that I absolutly love, I found that by knowing exactly how the book was going to turn out (and every turn along the way) made for a more than predictable read. I am used to Dodd captivating us with strong heroines and alpha heros that, while we know all will be well in the end, take us on a ride that is funny,touching,and suprising, leaving us unable to put the book down. I only finished this book by force, hoping that she would somehow put in a suprise ""whammy"" somewhere along the way. Alas, no whammy. I look foward to her next book but I wish I had left this one on the shelf. (If you have never seen or heard of ""Sabrina"", disregard this entire review!)"
1,Is Rape Romantic??,"I have never written a review before but absolutely had to for this book. I'd read all the ""Sabrina"" comments and didn't think that would bother me. It did! It was WAY to close to the movie in the beginning of the story. THAT I could get over - after she stopped following the movie scene for scene. What I couldn't get over was the SICK sex scene in the conservatory. It read like a sexual assault to me, and clearly out of character for Garrick and the storyline. What got him so enraged he would attack her sexually and continue to do so even after her repeated ""NO's""?!! That her ""body betrayed her"" was supposed to excuse all that and make this scene romantic???I'd hoped this would be an enjoyable read but instead had me lose much respect for this author and taint the regency genre."
1,Isn't there a law against this???,Did the author write this book while watching the movie Sabrina (1954 & 1995)? I could not believe the similarities!
2,blatant plagarism,"I have very much enjoyed the previous books in the governess bride series and usually love books by this author. But Sabrina, er...I mean, In My Wildest Dreams was a disappointment. The plot and characters are so identical to the Sabrina movies, comparisons are inescapable. Except for the expected titillating sexual situations and a slight twist on the family business, you may as well be watching the movie on video - literally scene by scene. If you've seen either movie and read the book, you'll know what I mean. I couldn't immerse myself in the story because I kept seeing the movie in my head. Frankly, I'm amazed the publisher and editors allowed this book to be published as is. Copyright infringement?"
2,Sorely Disappointed,"If you like the television version of this story with Harrison Ford about a gardner's daughter who falls for the youngst son gets shipped off and returned polish with attention of marrying him, but later falls for the older brother then I guess you'll like this otherwise I could have waited for this to come out again on televison."
3,Sabrina Remake,"I am a big fan of Christina Dodd - but Please....this story was so close to the movie Sabrina that all I could see while reading it was Harrison Ford in the guise of Garrick Throckmorton. Okay, so you changed the family business a bit and had the extremely HOT seduction scene but please, no more movie remakes. This was not fair to anyone especially an author who I have seen devise such other delicious plots to so brazenly adopt the Sabrina story into this book. But hey, if you've never seen the movie Sabrina - it is a great story with all the essential pieces that make Christina Dodd a #1 read - love story, great sex, humor, and mystery."
3,Good Customer Service; Print Server feature is not useful,"We bought this router because it was well rated on other sites, and one of the few in this price range with an integral print server. Network installation & configuration was fairly easy, but only because Tech Support is now available 24/7. The manual left out a key step, but Tech walked us through it. Neither of our printers would work through the print server... a major disappointment. Tech Support said they are not on their ""Compatible"" list, and although there are going to be firmware updates, they will not address these incompatabilities. One of our printers is an HP DeskJet 970... how can such a popular printer be incompatible? ADVICE: Call first to check if yours is compatible: 1-800-758-5489"
4,Tech support was awesome,"I didn't have much luck the first time around. This is my first router and I have no idea what to do with it. I tried following the instructions, but I still couldn't make the router work with my DSL and I was ready to send the product back to Frys and buy a simple hub instead.But I called tech support the next day and these guys were great. The first one helped me solve my connection issue. I called again since I couldn't get my Mac to work on the router and the second tech support specialist was most patient and helpful.Now everything works and I'm one happy customer. I didn't have to go through a maze of phone options before being ROUTED to the right person, I didn't have to wait long before I get to speak to someone and both guys I spoke to very professional, friendly and very patient.So for all those router newbies out there like me, this product works great and if you need tech support, you know you can rely on them."
3,"Worked well at first, unstable after less than 1 year","I thought this was a great router at first for the price and it used to work well too. Lately, it's been rebooting itself and refreshing constantly. Contacted Tech support and had a brain boggling experience from this supposedly technical support guy who didn't know jack. He kept telling me ""No, you're wrong"" and ""It's the ISP"". I'd like to think that I'm not your typical user having worked in various departments within IT for over 7 years.I'm the third person I've known personally who's had very similar problems as I have with this specific model of dlink router. If you're going to buy a router, don't go for dlink. I've heard some really good things from some of my colleagues about SMC in particular, and also Linksys and Netgear.Needless to say, I'll be looking to buy a new router soon."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,I bought this primarily because it had a printer server as well as a router for the internet. I am now returning it after spending all day trying to get it to work. I had two lengthy calls with D-Link's technical support who could not guide me on how to get it working properly. I have wasted enough time and will stay with my Linksys router. Although it does not have the print server at least it works very well.
1,Won't Keep Working,"I've had this router for about a year now. I remember it being difficult to configure, but for the most part it has worked okay until recently.Now the router stops working constantly. I have to reboot it by unplugging it, waiting, and plugging it back in. Once I go through this routine, it's good for another few hours of use.Obviously this is unacceptable. I'm looking for a replacement but its hard to find something with the a print server, which I really need."
5,Very helpful book,Ths book is great.It gives basic background to all the books inthe Bible and there is NO modernist posturing.Totally orthodox.
3,Delightful music,Delicious mixture of gregorian (voices) and chinese music (instruments). Helps concentrate and relax.
1,What the heck?,"My family has played this game for years. I was excited to purchase the Rook 100th Anniversary Edition. Well, the cards are not sized correctly. For some reason they are a little wider than a standard deck. Also, these are very poorly made. The plastic coating is non-existent, and there is no ""linen"" in the cards at all. They dog-ear after a couple of rounds of play. Possibly the worst deck of cards I've ever had the displeasure to use."
4,This game is a classic.,I remember playing as a kid and this 100th Anniversary Edition was the perfect way to introduce my kids to the game.
2,Not as advertised,These cards were supposed to be tournament quality. They weren't. My $5 Rook cards purchased at Walmart are higher quality! I was also dissappointed by the fact that the deck I purchased was missing the Red One. Returned the set I purchased for myself as well as one that I had purchased as a gift for my Rook-loving brother.
5,Rook is such a great game,"Rook is an amazing game that I have spent hours playing. We always draw up tournament brackets at my wife's family get togethers. At my family gatherings we just play it all night long; sometimes till 3am. It is a great game of strategy that anyone can play. As far as this specific product it was excellent, I loved the score pad that came with it and I couldn't be more satisfied with it."
1,ac hose,"end of hose was 180 degrees out of position, would not work on a 1993 honda accord se. Bought different brand locally."
5,long HDMI cable,Wanted a long hdmi cable for hooking up a laptop to the tv for my grandson. The price was so low I ordered 3 cables for less than the price in a store for 1. They are working great with their gold contacts.
1,DEFECTIVE,"Cable was defective right out of the box. Did not work with my cell phone (with micro HDMI adapter), or my computer. Sporadically worked with my DVD player."
5,The cable works fine !,"At first I was a little skeptical about the quality of this cable, now I realize that I was wrong. The cable works fine. I use it to connect a Toshiba SD-6100 Upconversion DVD player to a Mitsubishi HC1600 Home Theatre projector. The cable has no problem to support the 1080i resolution. (Note that I didn't use this cable with 1080p resolution because my projector doesn't support 1080p). The result is spectacular: beautiful colours, sharp images, 16:9 widescreen, upconversion to 1080i, ... However I have to wait and see whether the cable and its connectors are durable and reliable. I have a 6 feet Belkin Pure/AV HDMI cable (much more expensive) and I'd say that its connectors are ""stronger"" than that of this Link Depot cable. However, I'd say that the quality of the images produced by the Link Depot cable matches with that of the Belkin cable."
1,very cheap,This worked great for a couple of weeks but is cheaply made. The cable was glued into the plug. Glued????
3,They work... but are extremely cheap,"These HDMI cables work, I don't notice any degradation of picture. However, comparing them to a recent Toslink cable, the HDMI cables are actually thinner than my optical cable! They don't have ferrite cores. overall, I give them 3 stars, they work, but are cheaply made. I would rather pay just a few dollars more and buy cables from Monoprice."
4,big problem rectified quikly,I would like everyone to know this is a extremely good company to do business with. I had a problem with the cable I purchased they not only sent me a new cable but upgraded it to a stronger cable and I received it within 2 days. I would definitly do business with them again.
4,Cables,The cables are just what I needed to hook up my tv and dvd player and cable box thanks for them
3,ridiculous,I bought this item and it took over s month to ship! I was very surprised that the quality of this cable was so high. I have had it plugging in and out of my computer for about three months with no problems.
1,This cable legitimately broke my HDMI port.,"""Oh yeah, look at the price of this cable on Amazon, it's super cheap! All HDMI cables are the same, so here goes nothin'!"" - Me, a few months ago.I was wrong. I was very, very wrong. I obtained this to lazily sit on my couch and be on my laptop connected to my TV. Maybe it was karma that did this, but now one of my HDMI inputs does not work on my 42"" RCA LCD TV. I had to get up off my lazy butt to try and figure out the problem, and it turns out none of my other HDMI cables work in that port after using the Link Depot cable in that port.I threw the cable away. It was just not worth it to send it back. Also, I'm lazy, remember?"
4,It does exactly what it's supposed to and it's not expensive,"I wasted time and money buying overpriced hdmi cables at best buy. After returning all those, I got this. It coils easily, it's the perfect length I needed to reach from the TV to the computer from across a small room. It's what I expected. Sometimes it shows too much on the screen and often not quite enough when I (infrequently) use it to browse the internet on the TV. For just watching movies or online shows, though, it's perfect."
1,Cable Didn't Work,"Cable was dead on arrival. It didn't work when connecting my laptop to my flat screen TV. I had better results connecting three 6 foot long HDMI cables connected with two HDMI Female/Female couplers. I am really surprised that this 15 foot cable didn't work since it is really heavy duty and it contains those magnetic shielding things at each end. As a matter of fact, this cable is literally twice as thick as my other 6 foot cables. Also, my 6 foot cables didn't have any magnetic shielding devices and they worked just fine.The worst part about this is that this cable is so heavy that is not worth paying the shipping to return the defective item. I advise people not to buy this unless they don't mind throwing money away in the event that they get a defective cable as I did."
5,Cables,"Link Depot HDMI to HDMI Cable (25 feet)These cables are just what i was looking for. Sturdy, work great, don't know how they sell them so cheaply (Chinese labor I suspect)."
1,terrible product,I ordered the clearance item thinking I was getting a deal for longer undo cables. Was I wrong. Hooked them up and the picture was terrible. White snow flakes all over to the point I get better picture out of a set of rabbit ears. DON'T BUY THESE THEY ARE NOT QUALITY CABLES IN ANY WAY. THESE ARE THE CABLES THEY USE AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT POOR QUALITY IS!
1,Very poor quality,"I ordered this cable for Superbowl Sunday. My plan was to move only the extra TV to the kitchen (for a second viewing area so the living room wasn't so cramped) and leave the Tivo and other equipment in the other room. When I hooked it up, the signal was at best full of static, and at worst non-existent. Very cheap product. If it were more than $4, I would bother to ask for a refund."
5,"PERFECT ITEM, SIZE AND PRICE","These work just fine. I'm using it to connect my IPAD to my TV so I can run Netflix. The shipping was fast, and the price is certainly right..Great, even. I did notice that the cable is thinner than my shorter more expensive cable, (that's understandable) but it works just as good...so I can recommend these. No need to dump big bucks on long cables, these are very good and you'll be happy with them. They work just fine."
5,Perfect and so affordable,"These work perfect and are low cost. These are exactly what you need for great HD! Don't be fooled into buying expensive cables. They have no benefit over these and work just the same, if not possibly worse."
1,Get what you pay for,"Only works on HD channels. I cannot watch on-demand, non HD or my PS3. The channel flashes then goes black. Now I'm stuck buying two 15' HDMI cables from Best Buy or somewhere else. I was hoping that I found a cheap alternative to the brand names. WRONG!!. Atleast I only lost out on eight bucks, so cant complain to much, I was expecting them not to work."
1,Poor quality,Steaming is very bad...picture stopes and blank screen appears on TV for some time then again it come for some time .....not at all satisfied as I am not using this at all with this poor option ....
3,LINK DEPOT HDMI - GOOD ITEM,"The shipping was fast .The cables are long enough to have a laptop connected to a LCD - TV. Is always nice to have a bigger view I personally use my 37 inch TV.However, I haven't been able to listen to the audio with the cables usually I use the TV speakers - Don't know why ?Liz"
2,You get what you pay for.,"While these cables do the job, they dont do it very well. I am dissappointed in the quality they provide while watching BlueRay movies or HD tv in general. And playing PS3 with them is a joke. There are spots all over the screen. But Like the title says, you get what you pay for."
2,DHL is horrible - product arrived three weeks late.,"Yes, I know, I chose the cheapest shipping option. But that does not mean that the product should arrive three weeks after the estimated time frame that you gave me. I don't know what kind of deal they cut with you, but do your customers a favor and use UPS or USPS. Even USPS, in my experience, can get the product there in a reasonable time frame."
5,Perfect & Just what I Needed!,Great product for the best price I could find on this length cable. So glad I found this! Works great!!!
5,why pay more?,"Perfect for connecting my computer to my TV! The length was more than enough (obviously that all depends on how your room is set up). I noticed no difference in quality for this cable and others that I had previously purchased that were much more expensive. Honestly, I will never again pay more than $5.00 for a cable."
3,Warning! NOT 5 Meters,"I ordered this item because it is listed as 5 Meters. When it arrived, the package clearly reads ""4.5 Meters.""If you have carefully measured your cabling needs (like I did), be warned that you will not be getting the full 5 meters of cable."
1,Trash,"This product cost cheap becuase it is horrible. You're better off throwing away $4 then buying this cable. I bought it to connect it to my tv and micro hdmi adaptor and connect it to my phone, the videos cut in and out and there is some static and white spots on the tv screen, I've used this adaptor with other hdmi cabes and it works great, so I knew it wasn't my adaptor, also the video look dark with this cable. I tried connecting the cable to my cable box and my tv and the cable quality on my LG tv looked dark and horrible, again with the cable that came with my cable box, my cable looks great....please don't waste your time buying from this company again. There is no rating for zero thats why I gave it a one, but my rating really is zero.....PURE TRASH!!!!"
1,Not as good as it first appears,"The cable seemed to be surprisingly great quality considering the price and length.. but after a months of limited use, one of the connectors broke off. Not sure how it happened, but the connector which plugs into my laptop remained inside the laptop HDMI port.. instead of remaining attached to the cable.I was able to reattach it on the cable temporarily and it worked, but the metal contacts soon became bent and therefore the cable is rendered nearly useless.In short: the durability is lacking."
2,Try to stay awake!!,"This may confound some,but I thoroughly enjoyed the first Zero Woman dvd.Action,beautiful actress-and vile villains getting a good payback.Not so in this one.The plot had a good idea and let it fall short.This movie is SLOW,and uninteresting.Saori Oko is attractive-but went to the Spock school of acting,the other characters apparently went there as well.If you are looking for something along the lines of the first one,Beatiful Beast is Z.W.Returns antithesis.If you purchase this-I hope you are entertained more than I was.Decidedly more of a tragic-drama than 'hard boiled action'"
3,Not bad,"This show is okay. It's been quite some time sonce the last show, and this one, though nice, just isn't as entertaining as the original. A good watch, though."
1,"Please keep negative reviews, too.","I placed a negative review against this book and it was deleted after a few months. The positive review, over a year old, still remains. I did not skewer the author or suggest alternative books, but I did make a case against this type of advertising trickery. This book does not represent honest approaches to advertising as a profession and holds the public in contempt. There. I said it. Anything to let the people know we are all not Hucksters.Besides that, it's out-of-date examples does not hold relevance to the businesses and industries and trade practices and morals and creative movements that came about after the business-as-usual noon martini lunches of the early 70's.I Love Lucy is funny, but dated. This book is just plain dated."
3,Way of the Shadow,"I expected this installment to be like the other ""Way of"" books in the Rokugan series- have some fluff text and the rest be game mechanics. The only game mechanic in the book is a new disadvantage, and the rest is a series of four alterable game sessions told from the point of view of Kitsuki Kaagi. Fascinating read, fun ideas, but ultimately worthless as a GM resource."
5,Works and reasonable cost.,"Installation was a breeze as there is nothing to put together. The shower head is already on the filter unit and all I had to do was put some pipe tape on the pipe and screw it on and was done in 30 secs. Turned on the shower and no leak. My water flow is not that strong,, as the shower is up the upper floor and this thing hardly slowed down the flow. I'm sure over time, if it gets clogged, it may.First off, I'm in MD, and the water quality is decent and is not hard water. While showering, I noticed that the water felt a lil softer, but hardly noticeable. I did notice the very mild cholorine smell was now unnoticeable. After drying off, I did notice that the mild dryness on the face where I used to have slight whitish flakes in certain areas were no longer there and the texture of my face felt soft and not abrasive.I think it's worth the money for this much benefit that's going to last you an entire year.No complaints yet of anything. I'll update it if I do."
3,"Works, but doesn't last","The first month I was very pleased with this product, but after having it for less than 2 months the filter is already dirty. Now when I first turn on the shower the water is a dirty yellow. The building I live in is old, so I'm sure the pipes are old, but still for a product that is supposed to last 6 months, less than 2 is unacceptable. I'm getting another one that is a few hundred and is supposed to last 2 years. We'll see how that one goes."
4,Works well...,"Bought this item as I needed an extended showerhead to clear my automatic show cleaner. It is a nice product, very easy to install and as a nice touch, everything needed for installation including plumbers tape is included. A water flow restrictor is also in the box if needed. The flow on this shower head is VERY good so I am going to try the restrictor in the next week or two to see if I can still take a good shower with it on.The instructions advise flipping the filter every so often to keep a good flow up, mine has been good since install (6 weeks ago) with my daily shower.As for water quality, to be honest I don't really feel much of a difference with this filtered shower head. I still need to use conditioner in my hair though maybe not as much but since it solved my clearance problem and it flows nicely both in regular and massage mode, I am happy with it. If anything I can say the shower itself is cleaner with fewer water/soap spots to clean."
4,great product.......!,"I live in south Florida and every time I get into the shower I would sneeze. Once I changed my shower head to this one, no more sneezeing. Im not sure what the shower head does, but it workes."
2,Didn't help with dry skin,I was hoping this would solve the problem of dry skin after showering - no such luck. This filter made no difference.
2,Poor customer service,"Sprite High Output KDF Chlorine Massaging Shower Head and FilterThis fitler works great. It has made a big difference to our skin and hair, and so I am sure our overall health as well. I have one in each shower in my house.However, after only two months the nut which joins the shower head to the filter unit broke on both. I contacted the seller who asked me to send them to him to see. I did all the way from Oregon to Rhode Is. at my expense. He looked at it and told me I must have smashed it somehow and that was that. All I asked was for a new shower head, as the filter was fine. I not only had to spend my own money to send the item back, but I then had to go out and buy new shower heads! I was very unhappy and so I cannot recommended buying from this seller."
3,"Great for 6 months, then blows out","My partner and I each bought one of these and they worked great for about six months, after which the top of the plastic housing ""blew out,"" by which I mean that a hole appeared just above the ring of vertical ridges at the top of the filter, with a rubber seal of some kind pushing out through that split in the plastic. It started as a slow leak, and then after a couple of weeks, the water sprayed out quite suddenly and massively.There was no reduction in water flow that would indicate that the filter was too clogged, and in any case, this kind of a blowout should not occur. Furthermore, it happened to each one of us, maybe one month apart. It just happened to her this morning, which is why I am posting this review.I wish that Sprite would make this in metal instead of plastic. Now I am stuck with an extra replacement filter that may have to be sacrificed because I think I will need to buy a different kind, now, much as I otherwise like this model."
1,Made to fail,Stay away from this product. It is designed to fail. The plastic at the ball joint is brittle and thin. Ours split and broke off after a few months of normal use.
3,Kind of interesting.,"What happens is this - a news channel takes their camera and asks cosplayers a series of questions, about cost, time it takes to make the outfit and age. Age??? Well, anyway, the camera angles are bad, either too close or the image is washed out because of the sunlight reflecting off the white or pink of the outfits. There are some sections that deal with material and what outfits are the most popular but as it deals with Japanese Cosplay the prices they mention and the store they visit don't really help if you live in the US.Frankly, giving it 3 stars was a tad high, but I'm being nice."
3,Take it for what it is,"If you buy it looking for a guide to making your own costume, you will be disappointed. But if you take it for what it is - an hour or so of Japanese girls in pretty costumes posing and answering questions, it is reasonably entertaining."
3,Encyclopedia? Hardly!,"This is an entertaining video, but is nearly worthless for learning about cosplay. (the art of dressing up as anime, manga and videogame characters) The man who interviews the cosplayers (almost all girls) knows little about his subject matter. He seems more interested in the girls than the costumes. Lots of close-ups of faces and few full shots of the costumes. The second half of the video is a japanese reporter interviewing the proprietor of a costume shop. It seems more like an ad for the shop than a news story. The reporter is quite cute in the various costumes but she looks extremely bored. Somehow the whole thing is strangly entertaining as long as you are amused by lots of giggling schoolgirls."
4,Cosplay,This DVD give you look behind the making of Cosplay costumes and great work that go into them by these ladies
4,Steering Wheel Cover,This is a very nice product. Its much better than ones I've had in the past. It has a good grip to it and is very comfortable. I like the feel and look of it a lot.
2,100 pages too long...,"The story begins will Paris Minton who is a successful bookstore owner until he meets Elana Love. Within 24 hours of their initial meeting, Paris is beaten, his store burned to the ground and robbed. Paris enlists the help of his friend Fearless Jones to help him find Ms. Love and who burned his store.After, the first few chapters of the book the plot becomes very confusing and difficult to read. I had to actually force myself to finish. Fearless Jones was about 100 pages too long. The last few chapters in my opinion seem more a rush to hurry up and tie things together. The only reason why I finish the book was to find out who burned Paris's store.Fearless Jones and Paris Minton were well-developed characters but with a weak plot they just didn't stand out like Mouse and Easy Rawlins from Devil In a Blue Dress. I hope the next Fearless mystery is shorter and better than the first. -JeT"
1,Very Very Disappointing.........,"What a disappointment. After reading many reviews and considering the title alone, the book had nothing to do with Fearless and the story simply did not live up to it's title.The character, Fearless Jones, had lots of potential to be a real interesting character, but proved to be actually kind of boring.The book spent too much time chasing down a bond, a bad guy and his culprits and towards the end of the novel, you were bombarded with so many names that it became confusing and simply made for a poor mystery.I hope that Fearless Jones is not the beginning of a new series because he truly makes for a weak protagonist."
2,Disappointed!!!!,"This was my first time reading one of Walter Mosley's books, and I was disappointed that the book was very perdicatable. The book is called Fearless Jones, but I think that was to distract who the real FEARLESS person was."
2,A disappointment,"I agreed totally with the review in the New York Times Book Review, which I didn't read until after I had read the book--my mistake. It was a terrible disappointment from the creator of Easy and Socrates. Save your money."
2,dreadful,"Something about this book just didn't click for me. I love mysteries, but I just never appreciated what was going on between Leon, Elana, the Reverend Grove, Sol, the nazis, and the Israeli spies. Too many characters had odd parts that complicated the action. This was just a very disjointed, rambling story."
2,Yet another disappointment,"This is a thin, weak novel, a complete disappointment, much in the same way that more recent titles by Elmore Leonard, David Lindsey, Vachss, Burke, and even Michael Connolley have proven to be. Mosley joins a growing list of supposedly established writers in this field whose books I will no longer read."
1,very poor...,"...Paris Minton is minding his own business - a small used bookstore of which he is the proud owner- when a beautiful walks in and asks a few questions.....From this we get a very stupid story- Paris gets beaten up, slept with, shot at, robbed and his store is burnt down and it goes on for over 300 pages.Mosely has gone away from his 'Easy Rawlins' series and started this - incidentally the person named in the title is Paris's best friend and apart from being able to take a punch he is a complete dolt - after finishing the book I could still see no point in having 'Fearless"" in it.Mosely is normally good, with a finger on the era he writes best about - the L.A of the 1950's from the point of his black hero's - but he missed the mark here really badly.(2001)"
4,This would make a good tv series.,It's well done but outside of the black angle it's not much different than a police procedural. It doesn't reach the level and uniqueness of black music though.
5,"Part ""Easy"" and part ""Mouse""","Actually, Paris Minton is the central character, but that name wouldn't make as intriguing a title. Be that as it may, Fearless is one more great Walter Mosley character fit to stand alongside Easy Rawlins and Socrates Fortlow. And the story here is among the best penned by Mosley, with his evocation of 50's L.A. and population of living, breathing characters."
2,Not great,I found the encarnacion's voice too high for my taste. The words are difficult t understand. This seems to be sung more opera style than just normal singing.
1,this knife is a blatant ripoff,this knife is [...] it is a blatant rip-off of a Strider Knives Tiger. you can find out about the REAL THING on [...]
5,This book answered soooooo many questions for me - Its great,Just a short review ... I had often wondered what happened in the 3 days and 3 nights between the crucifiction and the resurrection ... now I know. And its this truth that I know that has set me free. You have got to read this one.
5,Needed Knowledge,The information shared in the E. W. Kenyon books are pure revelations. This information is grounds for living. Plus every human on earth has been looking for this all their life.Living has a warranty by one source.....this is it.
4,another good book by Brand Whitlock,"Uprooted by Brand Whitlock is the story of expatriate society in France just after the end of World War One. The characters are a varied cast, and include all classes and can be quite biting in parts when describing them. Their motivations, their personal situations, and their lack of understanding provide all the fodder for Mr. Whitlock. Not quite as good as his work, Transplanted, in my opinion, but still a very interesting read and it is worth finding this book."
1,Worst Game Ever,"This game is so full of bugs. I get a full house and 2 pairs wins. This is a constant problem, I have the winning hand and it awards the win to a computer player. It cant seem to add the winning pots to me right and it has NO all in button. You have to spend 5 min. using the + button to go all in. The kicker is that u need $50,000 to move to the next room. If i have 7500 and i quit the game the next time i play i get my 7500 but each of the computer players get 5000 each time u quit and play again. How are u suppose to get $50000 when u cant wittle down the players who always start with 5000?"
1,WORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRSTTTTTTTT EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR,"This game is the worstest worst ever in the whole entire world. If you want to have more fun, go buy ""Combat"" for the Atari 2600. Now THAT'S fun. Especially the one where your opponent gets to be the 3 little planes and you are the one ridiculously huge plane."
1,Do not BUY!!!!,The worst game ever!! Everybody just folds if you bet 40 chips or over. You never can go all in they fold no matter what they have.
1,DON'T DO IT !!,"As tempting as this game might seem (especially as the low price) do not get suckered into buying this game as it truely is awful. Slow, buggy and can't even go all in other than clicking your chips in one by one (boy that's fun)I am writing to save others the frustration. If you still want to throw a little money away, buy some bum on the street a McD's happy meal. It'll be money better spent."
1,Bad,"Bad game. Between not being able to raise from the Big Blind to it calling winning hands wrong, I would venture to say one of the worst poker games ever made."
5,Great sound - as promised,"Exactly what I was expecting - nice even tones. Smooth sound. I like this particular gauge since it still cuts right under the guitar, but not so far under that it falls out...if that makes any sense. Recommended!"
2,Not durable at all,"These headphones sound quality is great, however within 3 weeks the cord had a short. The company does not have good customer care at all so they give you the run around to get them replaced if they ever do."
2,"Great sound, less-than average lifespan","I have had a lot of crappy headphones in my day. These are EXCELLENT sounding headphones, but within 3 weeks of purchase, the headphone plug had already lost connectivity, and the left and right channels are inaudible without a fair bit of wiggling. The sound that is left is the oft-underused monaural channel between left and right. I really wanted these $40 cans to last at least a year or so, but i guess i was wrong. Time to go back to the crappy headphones Wal-Mart sells. I contacted the AKG customer support yesterday, and am awaiting response."
2,Sound great until they break,"I got these headphones on a free promotion. They sounded fine, but were really fragile. One night while adjusting the headband, they broke in half. The headphones come with a 2 year warranty. I called AKG USA and spoke to a tech support guy who said that they were not covered under warranty because they had been ""damaged"". I submitted that they were ""damaged"" because they were poorly designed and too fragile for daily use, and broke easily. He said he'd take my contact information and have a supervisor call me. Nobody ever called."
2,"Sound good, Break easily, Horrible customer service","These headphones sound great for their size. This is the second pair of the AKG folding headphones that I have owned and i like the size and portability of them. The problem I have with them is that I was putting them on about 3 months after I got them and one of the headphones broke off of the headband. There is very little holding the phones to the headband, so I would imagine that this is not an uncommon problem. When I emailed AKG, they said that the warranty does not cover ""broken"" units. I cannot fathom what the warranty does cover if it does not cover breaking. They offered to replace them with a newer model for a charge, but when I responded to ask how much the charge would be, I never heard back. I liked theses headphones, but if AKG will not stand behind their product, I cannot recommend that anyone else buy them."
1,Defective,"I compared a number of products before finally settling on these for their in-line volume control. When I got them, I was surprised, but not put off by their small size. I plugged them into my dell and proceeded to try them out. They sounded great and I was satisfied with my purchase. After about 15 minutes of listening pleasure my brother wanted to use the computer, so I moved to the family macbook. I noticed that the base and lyrics were unusually quiet. I fiddled with the jack and the sound popped into focus, crisp and clear as before. Then it went away again. I tried my headphones in my iPod two different times and in the dell again before I determined that it was a problem with the phones, not my electronics. The other reviews for these headphones are pretty positive so mine may have just been a fluke, but be warned."
1,WARNING : Terrible headphones,"First, of all the AKG headphones are so small and flimsy they seemed like they could break at anytime. The adjustable headphones cause too much pressure on the ears and head making you feel like you going to explode. The actual headphones are incredibly small and only have a limited amount of noise reduction. The bass is completely terrible playing way to low. I bought a pair of skull candy headphones on sale for just as much as you would pay for these. The bottom line is the fact that these headphones are a total rip off and waste of your money. Look around and you will find so many better deals unless of course you would like a personal set of miniature head phones then be my guest and buy them."
5,Compact with great performance,"These headphones were inspired by a house guest from France. I liked his so well, I purchased a pair for myself. I like that they fold up into a compact carrying case and they sound perfect to me. My son tried them and he wished the ear foam was a bit larger for his ears but agreed they have good sound quality. For the price- a definite buy.*** Footnote: After 3 MonthsAfter three months the headphones have broken as described in another review. Simply put: snapped at the connecting point of connection of the ear pad with the band."
2,Lacking...,"Some of the music in this soundtrack is decent enough, but to much of it is poor. THe original DragonHEart themes used are definitely my favorite, but little else fits. It seems to me a poor excuse for a soundtrack CD. PErhaps the composer was too afraid to put in any more than necessary. The final song at the end ""My Heart Goes with YOu"" was decent enough, but not worth bragging over or recommending. At any rate, buy the score to the first movie. It will give you all the finer points of this one and much much more."
2,Auto-pilot,"I can't figure out if Mark McKenzie is echoing Randy Edelman's score for the first movie or just ripping it off. He creates hardly anything new at all. The main 'Dragonheart' theme created by Edelman crops up a couple of times but the rest of the music on this 36-minute CD is just generic filler.It sounds very similar to the first in such a way that it appears McKenzie just took some of Edelman's cues and changed a few notes to make it sound like he'd made something new. It doesn't convince. And it doesn't stand on its own. It didn't even go well with the poor movie it was written for.The inclusion of a sappy song on the end and a hint of oriental inspiration cannot save this flop. Stick with the first score. Aside from the very brief inclusion of said theme on this CD, it's worthless."
3,Kite: Director's Cut,"""Kite: Director's Cut"" is an emotionless anime....or maybe that's the way the director intended it to be. I read the reviews of the other version, and how violent this anime is....so I decided to check it out. I wasn't THAT impressed. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy it; I just wish it could have been a bit longer. As far as the violence; ""Fist Of The North Star"" was FAR more violent!!The storyline goes as this: Sawa, a college student, is an assassin...Le Femme Nikita-style. Her parents were killed, and she was adopted by Mr. Akai, who's a police investigator. Sawa is actually trained by Mr. Akai to whip out the scums who have slipped through the system.This is basically the plot in a nutshell. I don't wanna give anything away for those who haven't seen it yet. I actually recommend renting this or borrowing it from a friend before purchasing it."
2,It Take More Than Pretty Girls to Make Good Anime,"This anime was billed as being like a cross of La Femme Nakita and The Professional. I suppose, in a very loose sense, it is.While the artwork is top notch, the story is devoid of any real emotion, the action scenes border on the ridiculous for an anime that's supposed to be ""realistic"", and there are no real efforts to make the characters appealing in any way or form.Do yourself a favor, skip this title. This is not worth the effort. If not for the artwork, it would have no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
3,KITE KICKS!!!,"Kite was an astonishing movie. I was highly impressed with the action, as well as the art. I can say that the shortness of the movie left me wanting more. Overall if you could say that anything really needed to be changed, it was the lack of character development. I still say go for it and get the movie.You will not be disapointed."
5,*KITE* an extravagent and breathtaking anime of greatness,"The anime KITE is a breathtaking japanimation film which i enjoyed greatly. The animation and quality was up to date with all other anime ive seen. i might not consider it the best but it is certainly up their with the greats. The story, dialogue, animation, and of course the fight scenes were mezmorizing.Its one of a couple animes ive seen that will keep you stunned for days."
3,Need to stick to the story,"When I purchased Kite, I did so based upon a description of the action. I did know that the movie was unrated which often meant nudity in anime. Since it was an action movie, I would not have been surprised by violent sexual acts. However, the sex scenes do not seem to add to the story. They are simply there, which makes them unnecessary in my mind.The action of the film is great. If the same actions scenes were depicted in a live action movie, it would probably be a summer blockbuster. If you are reading this to determine whether to purchase the DVD, I must state that you will love the hit she has to make in a men's bathroom. That is one of the high points of the film.However, the sex scenes are annoying. They detract from the overall action movie feel of the video. If you do not mind them, then the video is great. If you have children who might sneak a peek or if you become easily annoyed by such scenes, I suggest finding a friend and borrowing his copy to view."
1,Kite: The Plotless Bloodfest,"This anime was by FAR one of the worst I have ever seen. There was no real plot. It was simply a giant bloodbath. It seemed as if the writers decided they wanted to make a movie with a lot of blood and killing in it and then built the storyline around that idea. The only good thing that I have to say about ""KITE"" is the art. The art was actually fairly decent. A few things such as her eyelashes looked a little goofy, but otherwise I thought that if something had to be good about this move, then that was probably it."
2,A Difficult Watch,"As I'm not a huge fan of going beyond what is right, I found Kite a little difficult to watch. It contains not only excessive violence, but also rape and strong sexual situations without ever truly explaining its reasons. In many ways, all this movie was are those two things, as the story always seemed to push itself as quickly as possible toward sex or violence. Its one saving grace (at least the one that kept me watching) is its animation, which was done to near perfection. It also has a surpising ending.Note: There is an edited version for those of you who don't like strong sexual situations in their anime."
1,"Bad story with Ultra-Violence, but a Good ending","I must say this is one of the baddest (as in not good) Animes I've purchased. While attempting to be dark, gritty and disturbing it goes overboard with extremely violent violence and pedophilla innuendoes (though she is an 'Adult' in the US version, not so in the original - seen 3 or 4 versions of Kite). The only good thing I can say about Kite is the Ambiguousness of ending from just before the grocery bag scene to the cats and then the credits. Rent it before you decide to buy just so you know what your getting. I don't recommend this Anime for anyone... it's just too excessively over the top violent with not much else to justify its existence."
2,"Promising, but the ending ruined the movie.","To be honest, I found this movie because of the hentai, then decided to buy it for the same reason. While the action and hentai was alright, I followed the story pretty well.But towards the end I was getting excited, I was thinking ""Awesome, after all of that, I wonder what the outcome will be like."" and next thing I know I find myself depressed and confused at the ending. I understand that it's a dark movie and it was suppose to end dark, but you'd figure after the characters went through so much that they would at least deserve some kind of peace or happiness. Instead you're left wondering what happen after the movie ended. (Although you can probably come to some conclusion as to what happen.) But it's still annoying to sit through all that for basicly nothing."
4,Stunning,"The only thing that I have to say about this film is it is perfect in every way except one. The characters, the plotline, the action, and the unbeleivably superb animation (Makes Ghost in the Shell look like DragonballZ). But, like many anime films it needs to be longer. It needs at least an hour longer. Perhaps include more in depth flashbacks in order to build a stronger foundation for Sawa's motivation in the story. Oburi also needs a past in the movie other than a seventy second description. The dark and perpetual ending although powerful, comes way too quickly. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend that you see it."
3,"big action, small story","there is one amazing action scene in this movie...I think it's worth watching [maybe not owning] just for that. the story is not very developed, though."
1,Not the best anime,"I've seen worse, but not by much. I do like animes with alot of action, however this crossed the line fron enjoyable to just plain overkill. I tried to look past the ultra-violence, but there was nothing else in this that was particluarly intersting about it. I would not reccomend buying this movie, if you still really want to see it, go rent it."
3,Intriguing story...yet feels rushed,"When I first watched this movie I was new to the anime scene. I had great expectations but was beginning to get discouraged by anticlimactic endings. I am sorry to say that this was one of those movies that added to that. Kite starts off great with action and some forshadowing, I was really getting into the story. Yet it almost seemed as if right where the story should have introduced some character development, confusion and more action was put in its place.Though, this movie has its downfalls, take the time to check it out at least for the nice animation and interesting fight scenes. Kite is worth borrowing from a friend or renting but I wouldn't suggest buying it yourself."
2,Save Your Time - Far Better Anime Elsewhere,"Rented this on VHS at Bluckbooster. Well animated take on the orphan turned homicidal apprentice plot, but twisted in such a way that it ultimately makes no sense why the orphan puts up with the master at all. Terribly fetishistic when it comes to the best--and dare I say overused--effect: bullets that penetrate their victims, then explode several anxious seconds later. My alternate suggestion: They Were Eleven."
2,Had potential.,"Unfortunately, Kite is only a bad B-movie with a typical emphasis on violence and gore instead of developing a strong narrative. Not an Akira or a Ghost in the Shell, and definitely not a La Femme Nikita!"
4,"Gripping story, but not for those with weak stomachs","I had heard a lot of good things about this anime before I bought it. And, for once, I was not disappointed. This is not your average vigilante story, and suspense fills the entire 40 minutes. My only gripes are the music (I am not a fan of the sax) and the shaky voice acting. The violence is quite exagerrated (exploding bullets, anyone?) and blood flows very freely in this anime. But that didn't detract from the experience."
2,What a shame,"The premise of this anime was terrific, at first. Kite contains all of the elements that has made La Femme Nikita the classic that it is today. However, it felt as though Kite was missing a great deal. Kite's running time needed to be doubled in order to focus more on the relationships between the characters. I felt as though someone decided to edit out half of the story, maybe they did. We are given incredible action sequences throughout Kite, but the end just seems to come as a fizzle. I enjoyed the unexpectedness of the final scenes, but I felt there needed to be much more. Also, the end was not explained or justified, leaving the viewer asking, ""Why would that happen?"" With such a gripping story, and beautiful animation, it is a shame that Kite was not expanded to its fullest capabilities."
1,"kite the director's cut,don't you believe it.","i bought this version cause i had seen the censored cut version before and it was good but very confusing cause the missing sexual things to it.now i bought this version cause it was supposed to have all those missing things to it.guess again folks,it may say the director's cut.but it was not what it said it was.it turned out to be the exact same one i had seen which was the censored version.leaving me very disappointed with it i decided to give it to my brother.so, if you want it uncut and uncensored then go for the actual uncut version.don't be fooled like i was by getting the director's cut cause there is nothing new to it,it's just the censored release all over again.waste of time and money."
3,Not enougf interesting just short & bloody,I have seen lots of anime in my life but non of them was around 45 minutes this is a little bit crazy because when you prepare yourself to watch this anime it finishes.The story of this title goes very fast and has lots of holes in it the producers could make better anime with this story line but I think they didn't have enougf time and they left the anime with lots of space and missing parts.Also they didn't waste they time to create a good looking characters but its not that much bad.The story is full of blood only instead of this I think if they worked more on other elements of story it would be much better than this.So I suggest to rent this DVD.This is censored (Directors Cut) edition: 1 DVD - Kite storyboards - Original animation cels - Art gallery - 45 minutes
3,eh...,its alright to look at but mine broke at the clasp when I was just laying down....nothing else to say

5,Good Old Amy.,"Amy Denio is a living treasure here in Seattle, a City that barely knows what to make of her. This release is a stunning project she did with a bunch of Magyars, (Hungarians) and I'll probably end up eating it in my CD player as it is so utterly charming.Every cut has its compelling charm and the flow of it all is exceptional. I thanked old Feigenbaum for putting it out.It essentially welds elements of knitting factoryish experimental music to traditional Hungarian folkloric noise.And her Magyar is impeccable as she sings. You have to know Amy's voice to be able to tell her from Gabi Kenderesi, an actual Hungarian, on the opening charm loaded cut, Mirror Talk.To me, Magyar is one of the planets most beautiful languages even though I only understand a few words of it. I own nearly everything Muszikas ever put out and helped some other remarkable Magyars, Ujstilus, years ago.I'm sure Marta Sebestyan would approve and I hope Amy had time to hang with Csaba Okros when she worked on this."
3,look at my other Ravel reviews,"to see which other pianists I prefer. Avoid the cd.As I listen to ravel's incredible breath-taking mezmerising genius of poetic beauty and dazzling skills at composition, I understand why ravel and Debussy did not care much for the geramn romantic tradition. Ravel could not stand anything from Beethoven. In my 30 yrs, the only thing i liked by Beethoven was his 4th sym(only Walter/Columbia), but even that work has faded to a lost memory.Its amazing how few folk know the genius of Ravel, and even less appreciate the timeless beauty of his creations.ravel is the flowering and culmination of the romantic period , which is why i feel no desire to hear Chopin."
1,Not supported by XP,"We had the hardest time trying to install this game for our 13 year old daughter. She tried several times, and then my husband and I tried on several different computers. It ended up being too old of a game for any of the computers that we had in the house--both macs and PCs. This was not indicated from the seller. It did not run on Windows XP. Most ""Let's Ride"" games are pretty fun for my kids. We own several of their other titles. This one, however, was a waste of effort. Fortunately, we got it for less than 6 bucks, so not that much money wasted. From the looks of the other reviews, even if we did get it to work, there was not much to it. I should have read the reviews first!"
2,"Are They Serious? ""Let's Ride"" Should Stick to Jumping!","This game is SUPER easy! I finished EVERY SINGLE COMPETITION IN 10 MINUTES!!! There is nothing hard about this game! And the so called ""challenges"" are so easy, I bet my dog could do them in 5 minutes! Save your $20 people. Go get ""The Legacy of Rosemond Hill"" or ""Saddle Up: Time to Ride"" games for real challenges and a lot of fun. It was sort of fun seeing the replays of the competition, but still, THIS GAME IS SOOOOO EASY!!!"
3,Look! It's a bird! It's a plane! No! It's super easy!,"First off, I have to agree with the first review. It really did suck. The most fun I had was with my first horse, Jupiter (Appaloosa), but that's about it. The races are so simple. I thought you could just walk and just ride around too. Nope. You have to practice or compete. Sucky! Once you get the hang of the competion, it's a snap. Once you finsh that 1st horse, it's a snap. Buy a better horse racing game."
4,"Solid hitch, cheapo D-ring","Unlike most others sold on Amazon this hitch is actually machined to fit into the receiver, it is not just a raw casting. It fits the class III hitch on my Ranger perfectly, exactly as shown in the picture. It is powder coated black.The included D-ring seems to be from the bottom shelf. It is stamped with a 4 ton mark, possibly metric but either way less than the claimed 9500lbs (the hitch itself can surely handle much more). The red/orange pin looks cool, but it is very poorly painted. The coating is sort of soft, probably there to reduce rattling, but it was already pealing off when I took it out of the box.In the end this thing is Made in China and you get what you pay for. I am happy with the hitch and will probably just replace the D-ring soon."
2,i was tricked into buying this,i asked for the soundtrack and the guy at the store gave me this. even looking on the good side this isnt even good as a score.its mostly wierd sounds and synth.
3,a one sided tale,"This book does tell the story of Anthony Wayne's life and it has all the major events that one should know if one wants to fully grasp his life story. But, the author only tells about Wayne's strengths and always makes an excuse for Wayne's weaknesses. For instance, Wayne held a grudge against Arthur St. Clair from the time of the Revolution until his death. The author makes it seem like Wayne was justified in holding this grudge, but this simply isn't true. Wayne was very much in the wrong with this grudge and other historians point this out. This is not the best biography of Wayne's life that one can purchase."
2,Not worth to buy.,"The movie tries hard to be a thriller, but fails and bores people in fact.The writer guy looks smart and strong but is actually dumb and weak.I knew something wrong with his secretary already in the middle of the movie but couldn't he? Even when he found her psycho secretary stalked and took pictures of him without his awareness...A writer who has talent in writing with imagination can't sense something strange?He deserves to be played as a fool by his secretary."
3,"com""YULE""ation of pre 1965 rockin',lounge,bebop,and surf","All selections previously released, with 25% being seasonal standrds by which all subsequent versions are judged.Of the remaining eight, five tracks comprise a nice addition toward a yultide historical music library.The real gems of this disc are ""Mambo Santa Mambo- by The Enchanters ""and ""Surfin' Santa-by Lord Dougals Byron"".This CD would rate much higher if the compilers had chosen to include much more of the seldom heards from the vaults of these now histroic labels. Thanks anyway."
4,Christmas of a different era,"This disc won't overwhelm you with music you remember from the 50's and the 60's. There are the two principle ones, Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' 'Round the Christmas Tree"" and Bobby Helms' ""Jingle Bells Rock"", and also Bill Haley's ""Run, Rudolph, Run"". Those were memorable songs many Christmases back. But Brenda Lee's other song, ""I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus"", is a real cutie. And Bill Haley's ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" definitely fits. Then, there are the two surfer songs.Naw, maybe it won't stir up too many memories with unforgettable songs, but it does give you the Christmas spirit as felt by teenagers of the late 50's & early 60's. It sure wasn't a spiritual or religious spirit. You'll notice that here. But the CD is an accurate representation of the times, and definitely an adequate one."
3,Needs better instructions.,"I purchased this for my 15 year old, she says its a little slow loading the screens and its complicated with many folders and the instructions are not detailed enough, but sound is good."
3,Complicated,This MP3 Player is not user friendly. The sound is good. I like the lock feature and the headphones but I find it confusing and complicated to use all the features. Especially the main menue.
3,Interesting and lacking,"The title seems promising and the rubric of utopia is interesting but in the end this book does not add much that is new except showing that communism was apt to commit genocide due to its radical ideology. However whereas the genocides against Armenians and Jews were based on ethnicity the genocides in Stalin's Russia and Cambodia are only known as genocides because of the high body count.The author then goes on to claim that there was a genocide in Yugoslavia and that it was under the rubric of 'national communism'. THis is a misnomer and obviously shows the author understood little about the war in Bosnia, in which equal numbers of Serbs and Bosnians died and in which both were ethnically cleansed(in fact Croatia did the most ethnic-cleansing).Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Awesome Disc!,"I love this record. It took ten years for me to finally get it, but totally worth it! A (now) great throwback to true emo/indie rock, Building A Desert is a great collection of songs from start to finish. A little punk, a bit metal, a tad emo, and beautiful vocals... just get it."
4,"I love this labler, it is so handy","It is very portable and has an extensive set of features. The cartridges are a bit expensive, but I knew that before I purchased it. The biggest problem is finding them locally or without ordering directly from Brother (because Brother is retail prices while most other places are not)... but it is very difficult find what you need from one source. Even though I love the size of this... I would love it even more if it was a little bit thicker to support and wider labels as well... this would make it a truly versital and exceptional product. I love being able to just grab it and go know it is is charge up (working batteries). If something ever happend to it I would purchase another one with no hesitation."
2,A Huge Disappointment!,"This album was a huge disappointment. I loved their previous album. I suppose that gave me fairly high expectations for this one. But, even independent of that, this album is not very good. So much potential was wasted, I'm afraid to say. *sigh*By the way, what is with the first song being entirely distorted? I mean, I'm understanding of exploring creativity, but that just not enjoyable."
3,Different is Good.,"I don't understand why everyone hates the distortion. I think it works! They're going for a certain, strange fuzziness which appealed to me.Certainly, it's not what they were doing in the first album. And while I'm not as captivated by it as by the first (hence the three stars), I think it's a solid album.I bought it on the strength of Love Song No. 7 and am not disappointed.Satan Said Dance is a rather annoying song, though."
4,A grower...,"Clap Your Hands Say Yeah is the much-blogged band led by Alec Ounsworth. Some Loud Thunder is their sophomore effort as a band after their critically acclaimed debut. Melodic, Distorted, Delirious, Creative, etc. The album is definitely a step forward for CYHSY as a band. Even though it's a departure from their new wave-esque ballads, Some Loud Thunder still has a certain romanticized element about it. It's definitely more of a avant-garde rock album which is definitely a hard obstacle when making to tackle but Mr. Ounsworth does a chaotic job. It's a mess, a silly mess, that makes co-ordinates into a glorious triumph of experimental indie rock and a noisy/ unorthodox take on new wave/ goth punk. Whatever you wnat to call it, Some Loud Thunder is one of the best of the year so far (considering that it hasn't even been a month yet). Check it out and enjoy!Score:****/ *****Highlights:Some Loud ThunderYankee Go HomeArm & HammerFive Easy Pieces"
3,"Yes Its True, They're Not as Good as you Thought","This album is full of hits and misses unlike the self-titled where prctically every song is amazing. At first listen, I thought my CD was scratched becuase the title and opening track was sooo terribly recorded and/or produced.Easily the best song on the album is Yankee Go Home. Why, you ask. Because it sounds like the first album. The most noticable miss is Arm and Hammer where its like the group could not decide what notes are in what key and just put a bunch of random notes to make a shameful chorus.However, to anybody who halfway enjoyed the first album should own this one. Some Loud Thunder still has the nasily voice of the singer, but is slightly subdued."
2,CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY REVERB,"PRODUCTION SUCKS THE LIFE OUTTA THIS RELEASE. GIVES ME A HEADACHE. WHINING, WHINING...THE VOCALS ARE REAL PATHETIC. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
4,"Proof of concept, if nothing else","This album isn't nearly as tight, nor as catchy and exciting as their first. But what it lacks in pop appeal, it more than makes up for in raw inventiveness and the exploration of a sure and steady hand.Their debut was, for me, one of the landmark albums of the last few years. Musically adventurous and daring, but also grounded in solid pop appeal and a raw, sublime sense of artistry.That this album doesn't in the least bit disappoint is a testament to the artistic competence of the band. What they're doing is exciting and innovative and for the sake of the state of music, I hope they keep it up.Excitement and innovation, though, by itself, isn't worth much. But when it's paired with startling amounts of pure talent, as it is here, it's truly worthwhile.If this is a sophomore effort, then I hope these guys get held back a grade. I can't wait to see what they do next."
2,Could have been so much better,"Like most of the complaints here, mine centers around the production of the album. Some of the best tracks are absolutely ruined by distortion. And, not the cool kinda distortion you might find on a Neil Young album... but the kind that is just grinds on you more with every listen.Otherwise good tracks like like Some Loud Thunder, Emily Jean Stock and Arm & Hammer are vitually unlistenable because of the production of them. <sigh> Personally, I'm not a fan of the Flaming Lips-esque bleeps & blips that are scattered through ""Satan Said Dance"" either. But maybe you are.On the upside, The album finishes strong with the last 3 tracks. ""Yankee Go Home"" & ""Underwater (You & Me)"" and the haunting ""Five Easy Pieces"". They showcase what the band is capable of.If not for the (assuming intentional) lousy production, we'd have a pretty good album on our hands here."
3,meh.,Definitely not as good or exciting as the debut. None of the tracks on this release really do anything for me. Mellow indiepop mediocrity. Not a bad album per say but somewhat boring. Looking forward to the next release. Hopefully another short wait...
3,In the vein of Idle Race?,"Is it just me, or do some of these songs sound EXACTLY like The Idle Race or The Move from the 60s, except with a higher voice?"
2,So disappointing.,"This was my first garden fork ever, bought last spring at a local nursery. Unfortunately after being left out in the rain too many times I guess, the internal wood rotted and the fork came apart at the seam a couple weeks into its second season of digging. Desperate to finish, I ran to home depot and bought an inexpensive version, which lasted a couple months before it snapped. (I have some heavy clay soil)That night I was so happy to see my old fork on Amazon, and, pledging to diligently shield it from ""the elements,"" I re-purchased it. Shipping was quick; it arrived in only 4 days (via super-saver shipping), but when I opened the package and pulled out the fork, I noticed a couple flaws in the lacquered coating of the tines and neck, resulting in some seriously sharp edges. The defects seem cosmetic, just lacking attention to detail, and maybe these protrusions will wear down in time. When was my last tetanus shot? Maybe I should just return it. Aargh. Frustrating."
5,"Great funnel - just NOT 6"", only 5"" across top!","Very high quality product, sturdy and works well. It's just not even close to 6"" across the top, unless you count where the loop handle sticks out. It is exactly 5"" inside diameter, which is plenty large enough but just not what is advertised. I am very happy with the funnel; however, just don't expect to get a 6"" one!"
4,Educational equine book,"This is a good educational book for every thing related to the horse. Example: aging a horse, conformation, vices, etiquette, etc. I recommend this book for anyone who wants to know about the horse and rider."
2,Not Worth the Money,"For this much money I expected more from Sweden. The most frustrating issue is the red plastic coated handles. They are not glued on and when ever you trim a lot of grass edging they ""walk"" off the handle and you then have to re-insert them in the metal handle. Very annoying and cheaply manufactured. Also, my Craftsman clippers can cut through several blades of grass where this clipper struggles to get through the same amount. They don't seem that sharp. The only redeeming quality is the flexible angle feature for positioning the blades at different angles to your cutting source. I would not purchase again at the price I paid."
1,Do not purchase: A pure rip-off,"The previous review is perhaps a bit too kind, and I still wish I'd read his review before purchasing. This company must have made good products in the past, but their Chinese outsourcing is perhaps not maintaining a high quality standard. Negative highlights:-handle guards fall off during use-only cuts fairly small amounts-doesn't stay very sharp-small bladePositive highlight:-angling system is easy to useThe title is also misleading: it is 14 inches from handle-base to blade-tip, instead of a 14 inch blade, which you might believe from title."
5,Deserves To Be remembered as a True Classic,"Life has taken me many, many places over the years, and changed relationships and lifestyles I always exspected to be the same. But in picking up this book again after about 25 years, I was amazed at how easily I slipped back into the magic of Annabell, and her little dog, Gloria. Every child should read this book. So often today kids don't choose to explore the places reading books like this can take them. But we, some say the last reading generation know that this book will live on in our hearts forever as a book that renewed a passion within us, a passion to always believe... Happy reading!!!Helen Hunt"
3,CD,"No Flying in the House, written by Betty Brock, is a story about a girl named Annabel who finds something about herself that she never knew. Annabel,a three year-old girl, doesn't have any parents but has a dog by her side named Gloria. One day Annabel finds a cat named Belinda and the golden cat teaches her something that she never knew she could do. What I like about the book is that you never predict what is going to happen next. The author's message was that when you really want something you have to try hard to get it."
3,pretty darn good,"I thought that it was a pretty good book. One of its problems was; I have to write a book report for school and I chose this book, but one of the questions was what's the seetting, and the book really doesn't say much about that. I still enjoyed it, but i thought that it wasn't very complete, like the ending could have disired a bit more of ""what really happened"". I still recomend it to kids who like fairy tales, but i don't really like fairy tales. I was still a good book."
3,GM,"No Flying In the House by Betty Brock, is about a girl and a dog and there adventure together. The girl, a three-year-old named Annabel, finds out how to fly. The dog, a dog that could talk, her name was Gloria, and could do many tricks. She also had a gold collar.I like how Annabel could always count on Gloria. I also like how Gloria could talk. The Author's message is good always wins and to never fly in the house."
3,Matthew's review,I did not like No flying in the House. It wasn't very interesting. It's about a girl that is half fairy and half person. She had a dog that knew about 367 tricks and could talk. It was a little boring. I would sort of recommend this book. If you like fairy stories you would probably like this book.
3,An enchanting and magical story,"Annabel Tippens doesn't have parents to care for her; instead, she has a very tiny talking dog, Gloria. Annabel is quite happy with her life until one day she meets a talking cat named Belinda. Belinda reveals secrets to Annabel that will change Annabel's life.Talking dogs and cats...china animals that come to life...fairies...No Flying in the House has these and more. I loved reading this book."
5,"I just remembered, my first book.","I've read this book only once, I was in the 3rd grade, ( I'm talkin' 25 years ) and I remember I couldn't take the book home, so I would read it during class, and the world would not exist for me because I would be sooo absorbed. I loved it and please believe me it is UNFORGETABLE."
3,It is cheaper plastic,It will get the job done however it has a flimsy plasticy feel. I am OK with that but when doing a large pineapple it tends to bow and go sideways losing your fruits flesh. I would not buy again.
4,Works great,"I have one of these slicers from a different vendor and have found it to be very good. It has been in use for many years now. The only problem is after a while the buttons that hold the handle on lose their outward pressure and the handle comes off at times. That is the reason for the four stars. I measure how deep to go with the slicer by placing it next to the pineapple after the top has been sliced off. That way I won't go too far and break out of the bottom of the pineapple. It happens sometimes, though. There has been no big problem getting the core out of the slicer like some have commented on. I remove the handle and push from the top and the core comes right out of the slicer at the blade end. Fresh sliced pineapple taste so much better."
4,Well constructed slicer/corer,"I promptly received this unit 3 days ago, yesterday I purchased a large pineapple and tonight I used it for the first time and I'm fairly impressed, it is made of plastic but feel pretty sturdy to me, top handle locks in the body with a snap, after I removed the pineapple top I followed the instructions and in less than 5 minutes the pineapple was cored and sliced with very little effort. I did not give 5 stars because I was expecting somehow I wouldn't need to cut the bottom of the pineapple... the idea was to use the pineapple skin as a vessel for my pina colada but you have to in order to pull the core out.Looking forward to use it for many more times"
5,Amazing!,"We bought this item after seeing one at a friend's house. It works like a charm, can't imagine what we did before. Freeze the empty pineapple rind to use as glass. Make fruity drinks pour into rind add straw and enjoy!"
2,"Great at first, but beware","I loved this product when I first got it, then saw that the pineapple was no longer coming out in nice clean slices but more like it was squished, I discovered that the cutting blade was blunt and there is no way to sharpen it, its plastic and soft plastic at that. So its great for a few pineapples and thats about it. I am going to look for a metal version of this with a cutting blade that can be sharpened."
4,gotta get it if you love pineapple,"i love pineapple, but HATED cutting fresh pineapple: all the peeling off of the rind and then cutting out the eyes, juice dripping everywhere--it was a mess!! i LIVED in hawaii and was embarrassed to admit that i resorted to buying costco pre-cut slices, which are barely acceptable.once i got this handy slicer, though, i could finally enjoy fresh pineapple without all the pain! yes, it did end up shredding a pineapple or two, but here's my best guess as to why that happened--the pineapple was overripe. so make sure it's fresh and you should be good to go!"
4,Wonderful pineapple corer,"When I unboxed this product, I thought that it was pretty cheap plastic, the instructions were too vague, and that I just threw money in the trash. Then I bought a couple of pineapples and put it to the test. This is awesome! The material doesn't need to be surgical stainless steel... it cut right into the center of the pineapple with ease. Also, the instructions didn't need to be more in-depth... there is no further thought process to put into it. Simplicity at its finest! I'd give it a fifth star if it had adjustable width for wider pineapples."
4,Pineapple Slicer,"I was looking for the mango slicer but saw the pineapple slicer and decided to go with it instead (mangoes got too expensive). You have to use some force to get the corer to go through a pineapple, but once you get through the end, you can pull the slicer out and viola, neat delicious pineapple slices tumble out. The only caveat is that some of the pineapple meat will remain on the sides that the slicer didn't get to, but you can always cut it away with a knife. The slices themselves are evenly cut and almost an inch thick. Delicious!Careful with the teeth of the slicer; even though it's all hard plastic, the teeth are quite sharp."
5,pinapple slicer,I bought the pinapple slicer as an Xmas gift. It was exactly what they wanted and with the slicer I included a pinapple which they opened immediately.... and loved it..... It works great..
1,"Wasteful and Useless--Deserves 0 Stars, but Rating System Does Not Allow That","The Vacu Vin Pineapple Slicer had good reviews, so I thought I would try it. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it wastes much of the pineapple. Also, it is messy and impractical.I followed the ""directions"" for the Vacu Vin Pineapple Slicer (i.e., 4 textless picto-grams). Upon first use, I screwed it in to the bottom of the pineapple. I pulled it out, resulting in juicy mess, and a handful of thin, mushy rings (this was NOT an overripe pineapple, mind you). There was a .75 inch ring of good pineapple left on the shell wall, not to mention a 1.5 inch plug at the top and bottom of the pineapple (you can't screw the Vacu Vin Pineapple Slicer down below a certain point, and you have to cut off the top of the pineapple as well). I ended up having to use a knife to save all the wasted pineapple. Supposedly, this product allows you to avoid the knife in the first place. Don't waste your money; you may be disappointed."
1,ruined the pineapple,"I purchased the plastic version of the Vacuvin pineapple slicer. It was highly recommended by the produce manager in the grocery store. Disappointed isn't the word to use. It made mush out of most of the pineapple when I started, and as I continued most of the juice started to be extracted. So I stopped. At least when I do it by hand I haven't wasted half of the fruit.It is a complete waste of money"
4,this works,"I love pinapple, but I hate cutting it up. I was concerned that a peeler would leave alot of pinapple left on the rind. This thing works like a champ. There's a knack to it, but once you get it down it works great. The only thing is, sometimes it's difficult to pull the fruit sliced from the rind because of the suction. But otherwise, if you choose your pinapple right there us minumal waste and the juice is saved. No more waste than the old fashion filet and chop method I used to use."
4,"Quick, easy but wasteful","The slicer works easily and makes the job of coring and slicing a pineapple a cinch, but it does leave a lot of edible pineapple behind."
3,stainless is better,"product works well but for the extra dollar get the stainless version as it is more solid and likely to last a lot longer, it does how ever do the job perfectly"
5,"works well, good price","Very happy with this purchase. My pineapple consumption rate has tripled since getting this.There's a bunch of juice that starts spilling out near the bottom of the cut, so I recommend finishing the slice over a plate or bowl so you can drink it afterwards."
2,Pineapple slicer,In order for this device to be effetive the pineapple must be very firm and not very ripe. If the fruit is ripe it becomes very medsy when sliced.
5,Works great,I got this because I am one who loves fresh pineapple but hate to cut it up. This slicer/corer works great. Its easy to use and takes only a few minutes to fully slice a pineapple. Its also good for cleaning out the pineapple for use as a fruit bowl. I would recommend this for anyone who loves fresh pineapple but hates to cut it.
2,Not a great help,"Spend a bit more and buy a sturdier, metal corer. This one is hard to turn and mashes the fruit into a pulp. I find cutting the pineapple into thirds helps a bit. I was unable to push and turn the corer to get it all the way down a whole pineapple."
4,worked great,"used it once to test.. worked easy as stated and cut nicely. used some little effort and then it popped out really nice.. up side, it is easy to use.. down side is that , even though it cuts smooth large circle, it does leave a lot of pineapple in the shell..{hubby loved that, put his tea in it}. nice if your using it for drinks, but not so great is you want to use all the pineapple for cooking.. plastic seems strong.. one has to guess though as to when deep enough is enough to cut, due to many different sized pineapples."
4,better than cutting up a pineapple with a knife,"I've used this twice now. I wanted to fresh pineapple rings to grill and put on veggie burgers. The first pineapple came out completely mangled. Still good, but no usable rings. It did however get all the pineapple meat out of the pineapple. The second time it used it the pineapple came out in perfect rings just like the picture, but one half of the pineapple had more usable pineapple meat in in, so I cut it in half and ran a knife around the skin. I think the trick is to buy a pineapple on the smaller side (the first one weight 3.5 lb with the top on. I didn't weigh the second one, but it looked bigger), and to use a lot of muscle while your twisting it (I'm pretty short, so I actually stood on a stool to get more leverage with the second pineapple). You also want to be doing this in a large bowl because lots of juice will come out."
3,"It works, but too much fruit is wasted","The product works relatively well, but, depending on the size of the pineapple, it leaves a lot of the fruit on the skin, so I had to use a knife to get it, which defeats the purpose of using the slicer. Also, you need to make sure that you insert and continue right along the core, otherwise many slices will have inedible areas."
3,barely useful,"The idea behind this device is ingenious. But you need to have the right size pineapple for it to work (note the one sold by Amazon is size ""medium""). Here in Hawaii we get lots of large pineapples so a lot of the flesh gets left behind. Worse, if the pineapple is ripe and juicy the slicer tends to shred the fruit to bits, as opposed to slicing it neatly. This might have something to do with the plastic blade being too blunt - the metal version (Vacu Vin Stainless Steel Pineapple Easy Slicer) of this device might be more effective but I'm not about to waste more money trying it out..."
3,Slightly hard to use,Although this item works I cannot see it working for a very long time.It is very hard to insert and turn and to pull out the pineapple takes some muscle. It comes in two pieces and the plastic handle top does not look like it will last long. I would try and find one that is more durable possibly made out of stainless steel.
3,"great idea, but, arrived broken.","Bought this as a gift after seeing review in Readers digest. It came with no ""button"" to attach the handle. For the price it wasnt worth returning. Son will still use, but just without handle. I think the stainless steel version might have been studier."
1,Junk,"This thing is a piece of junk. It didn't cut my pineapple into the beautiful rings everyone talked about. Instead, it just shaved the top two inches of my pineapple and turned it into a juicy mess. Very disappointed."
1,Lousy Product,Do not buy this product !!It's made of plastic and won't slice a pinapple. It just squeezes the juice out and you wind up with pinapple mush.It took 30 minutes to cleanup the mess on the floor and my clothes are still soaked with pinapple juice.This thing is just a plastic stick. What piece of garbage. I hope it gets discontinued.
4,handy tool,"I love pineapple, but I hate cutting it. I've used this pineapple slicer a couple of times and it works pretty well. the product works like it says, I still make a bit of a mess when cutting the pineapple, but I think the more I use it the less mess I'll make."
3,Gets the job done,Nice product that gets the job done. The top handle release buttons tend to release too easily when you start to pull the pineapple out. Probably could use a slight redesign.
4,Can Leadership be Taught?,"I had the opportunity to meet Dr. Myles Monroe at Harvard University last April when he presented at the Leadership & Negotiations Conference. After his lecture, I went to the book table to purchase a copy and say hello. What amazed me was his perspective on how leadership truly needs to be discovered because the seeds lie within each of us. ""Simply put, true leadership is serving oneself to the world."" And concept that turns leadership upside down. It's not servant leadership, but rather self sacrifice to serve your God given mission. Laser focus, nothing else matters. Think MLK. This book provides many insights on how to get there and points out what ultimate leaders have in the form of a check list. Now I know what I need to work on!"
3,"The bottom line is ""Attitude""","7/11/05 Dr Munroe Myles focus throughout his guide on the suposition that ""all are born to be leader and not many are ""born leaders"" but can and have become one through situations which forced this role or a deliberate aim for the role with no particular agendae in mind."
5,Delightful and thoughtful collection of short stories,"Randall O'Brien is a pastor, a college professor, and an exceptionally gifted communicator. In this book he displays a remarkable ability to find the teaching moment in the events of everyday life. The book is collection of stories in which O'Brien calls upon events in his own pilgrimage to become storytellers for the Gospel. The book is full of richness and warmth, southern grace and uncommon insight. The short story nature of the book makes it ideal for occasional reading (i.e. a chapter before bedtime), since there are no plot elements which must be maintained from chapter to chapter. It is a fun book, and I'll bet you won't be able to read it without at least one giggle, one tear, and one moment of, ""I have to tell so-and-so about this."""
2,too basic,"I feel that if you have never performed a face to face interview with subordinates that this may be helpful. It would be good for the fast food industry for someone who just went from head cashier to day supervisor. Karen had many good ideas but including what to say, what the subordinate might say was a little too simplistic. I would like to have her use her expertise in a more professional book."
1,Really Cheap,The case is made of really thin and cheap silicon. There is nothing to protect the screen so it is pretty much useless. The arm band that came with is also very small. I'm 18 and it won't fit around my upper arm. I would suggest someone who is looking for a case to spend the extra couple bucks and get a better one then this.
5,Dope sheit!,"Icey is the sheit, and it is definetly an essential mix. If you like everything and anything from break beats to house, get this. Definetly worth it, Rock on Icey. ~`*peece ya'll*`~"
1,dj icey essental mix,"the cd lacked subtance,this is electronic dance music which i don't like. this cd did nothing to make me want to dance. this is not funky and it should not be put under this heading on amazon. there was only one track that i liked and it was dooms night, which i already have."
4,"I really liked this movie, too!!",I thought this was a very entertaining movie....Kim Cattrall is beautiful!! I think you will really enjoy the performances by McCarthy and Taylor. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes fairy-tale like stories. You won't be disappointed.
3,"""Anthony"" is the main scene-stealer","Meschach Taylor, known to millions as ""Anthony"" on the old ""Designing Women"" show takes control of every scene in which he is featured. Of course, the part is stereotypical but most Hollywood productions rarely stray from their preconceived notions of how people behave, be they straight, gay, foreign, rural, or even urban. His role simply reflects what the ""men in the suits"" felt was appropriate for a window dresser.The film is mindless and was not intended to be an Oscar contender.It should be seen as part of a double bill with another Andrew McCarthy opus: ""Weekend at Bernie's"".Both are entertaining fare, nothing more and nothing less."
3,i love the 80's,"Yes its a horrible plot, but I enjoyed this movie as a kid. I watched it so many times its ridiculous."
5,Heart tingling and great for any romantic,"This is a great movie and although the cinema technics may need work, I must agree with another reviewer when I say that I just don't understand a society that would look down on a fantastic romance like that. I am ashamed to be a part of society that looks down on romance, because if we don't have Love we have nothing. God's love is supreme. And we need it. He gave us a great gift in Love and it's too bad our society can't appreciate it. My point, you have to look past the cinematechnics and glamour and even the comedy to really appreciate how great of a stroy this is andd I hope someday our society can appreciate it. Starships song is so great and does indeed add much sentiment to the movie, but the idea is still awesome and heartfelt"
3,Pleasant to watch,"A light and rather predictable movie. I enjoyed the lack of violence, profanity and blood. A nice movie the whole family could enjoy."
3,Mannequin A Funny Comedy!,I recommend this film as a light hearted adult comedy. The fairytale edge helps to weave the magic within the story and project the comedy of the riduculous situations the plot presents. The story of a mannequin that can animate into life at times and leave trouble behind makes for an interesting tale!
3,Only if you liked it before,"I LOVED this movie when I was much younger. Kinda cheesy, but was happy to find it."
2,Read DVD information,"I love this movie, but it would not play in my dvd player. This product was asking for a regional code, which means it has to be converted to USA dvd players. I didn't even know such a thing exist. Please browse/read about the dvd and certain description or disclaimers carefully. Sorry had to return."
3,Classic Corny 80's flick - Bad Audio,The audio mixing is poorly done. For instance; the voices of the actors are barely audible so you turn up the volume. The next scene kicks in with a music intro and you are blown out of your seat because now the volume is too loud. Back and forth like this through the whole movie.
2,Embarrassing,"This movie is little more than an embarrassing reminder about everything that was wrong with the '80s. Bad acting, horrible clothes, corny music, and a lame script do not complement each other in a positive way."
1,1 Star is pushing it!,"Those words pretty much sum it up for this turkey of 80's film making. To be fair there were really not very many good comedies during the 80's, (only 2 were Ghostbusters and the Breakfast club), but this movie was a rock bottom. While there is nothing wrong with a fantasy of a mannquin coming to life for the person who created her-it belongs in a childrens fairy tale! If not for Kim Cattrall being as wildly attractive as she was in this movie I might never have been able to get all the way through it. Part two I have not seen nor do I have any desire to!"
1,Boring,"I have seen this movie way too many times and am very sick of it. It plays on television way too many times and I am forced to watch it or hear it cause somebody else in the house likes it. So, if you enjoy the movies from back in the 80's, then you will like this one. Of course, some ""older"" movies are classics and you can never get sick of watching them, but this one just isn't one of them.I just don't like the acting and the story line in this movie. I don't think it is funny and they could have done better."
5,mannequinn magic,This is a guilty pleasure movie. My favorite part I saw him doing awful things to a dummy. This is classic. One of Kim Cattrals best.
4,Childhood favorite.,"Mannequin starring Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrall is such a guilty pleasure, I used to watch this fun disaster over and over again when I was a little kid. This film is so silly, you can't take it seriously, you just have to have a good laugh at this one. The both stars do have great chemistry even though the script and plot are cheesy as hell. Look out for Estelle Getty, she always steals the show. Defintely one to buy, I consider this a camp classic, enjoy!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"What a waste of marketing and production dollars. Was there anyone who rented Mannequin on VHS in the last five years who thought ""Gosh, this movie would be so much better in digital widescreen""? Could be worse, I guess. It could come bundled with Mannequin 2."
1,Why are this movie's defenders so apologetic?!,"You have to wonder about a movie's worth when its defenders keep telling us up front that it's not a ""classic."" What they really mean is, this movie bites but we have no taste. (Oh, I didn't mean the pun.)Some movies are made with what seems like both the filmmaker's eyes focused on the film itself (say, Bergman, Antonioni) -- art over commerce. Some with what seems like one eye on the audience (Coppola, Chaplin) -- an artist appealing to the masses. And some with both eyes on the audience, forsaking art and credibility for box office (see the end of ""Jaws,"" when Dreyfuss's character, for no other possible reason, survives). ""Mannequin,"" on the other hand, not only has both eyes on its audience; it gets down off the screen and kneels between the audience's legs. This is one desperate -- and desperately unfunny -- movie.(And I mean, come on -- a Kim Cattrall movie and we don't even get to see any full frontal nudity!)"
3,Cute & 80's,"This is a fun movie, and so typical of the 80s' weird concept movies. The whole family can enjoy this - the story line can be picked up by all ages. And it's great for kids of the 80's wanting to relive those fun years.A really sweet and fluffy story.It is annoying in parts (like an over-the-top flamboyant gay guy that really is the epitome of 80's gay stereo-typing) Or how no one thinks much of a guy obsessed with a shop window mannequin.But then you remind yourself, that it is just a bit of fun; you really arent supposed to take this seriously. And finding it funny doesnt totally undermine your intelegence... too much. (I bought it!!)Extremely well cast, both lead and supporting actors."
4,Good love,"Funny romantic comedy. Wouldn't it be great if we all had our own mannequin come to life and make us feel loved? Well dream on, or watch the show and just be glad it happened for this guy. Funny."
5,Baian: A Stealth Assassin,"Description: Using his knowledge of acupuncture for both good and evil, Dr. Baian considers himself an asset to his community. He is a murderer, but he claims to take money only for killing wicked people. Set during the Edo period, this series takes place largely in brothels and bars, capturing a sense of the street culture during that time.I have really enjoyed this series thus far, the last episode that I seen was vol.#4 it was a full length movie, best episode so far."
3,arrrgh bad disc,My wife and I started to enjoy this serieswith Disc Oneand loved itonly problemDisc 2screwed up....not with scratches or anything....just the digital copy is a messDisc 3&4 were okbut out of 7 episodes....we only got to watch 5The only downside is Baian basically has one kill move with a needlefortunately it is really well done and that doesn't really detract from itI only gave it 3 stars due to the screwed up Disc and I bought it new from Amazon
1,not what it says or shows,the drivers that i got for it was not for the phones that it says i have a katana 6600 and it dont have the drivers on the cd it is only for the 8100
1,Cord never worked,Called and did receive a response but the cord never worked. It was a waste of money.
5,Great Value!,Such great condition even though it was used. Came quite quickly and had vital information! I especially enjoyed that it talked about how to travel and give the proper healthcare to an eskie. I would recommend this.
5,The must-have Builders Bible,"After contracted builders let me down and stole my deposit, I decided to build an extension to my house myself. Having never built anything more than a kids playhouse, I went in seach of books to help. I'd taken out many from my local library, but they only gave brief explanations on various items--nothing from the ground-up. Then I bought this Housebuilding book--it is absolutely wonderful! It covers everything from footings and foundations, walls and sheathing, to the cupola on the rooftop in clear, concise grammer and very easy-to-follow illustrations. It gave me enough confidence to go ahead with my project and it turned out beautiful! Even though my extension is done, I've kept the book handy to help me with my next project--a new shed/workshop. Bottomline--if you want an all-in-one guide and straight forward instruction in quality building, this is definitely the best reference manual you could get."
2,NARROW PERSPECTIVE,"I bought this book under the mistaken impression that it covered many types of houses, including stone houses and brick homes etc. Unfortunately it only covers construction of wooden houses typically found in North America.Yet, here in Africa, as well as in Europe, Asia and Australia other building materials are in prominence. There are other continents on terra firma, you know....A disappointment."
1,Hard to find information in this book.,"The Index is very poor. I tried looking up the Spy Museum and Holocaust Museum. Nothing under Spy or Holocaust. I looked under Museum, and then looked for Spy and Holocaust. I also looked for National ... museum.I went to the internet, and found that the full names are:International Spy Museum and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.To my way of thinking, Spy and Holocaust should have been in the index. When I have to use Google to find something in a book's index, I think that the index is useless."
1,Advertised as Like New - Wasn't. Took 4 Weeks to Get,"It took 4 weeks to receive the book from the time I ordered it- almost too late to get it before my trip departure date. The shipping label appeared to defective and maybe that was the problem in the delivery time. Also, the book was missing the tear out map and many pages contained someone's underlining. That isn't a big deal but it wasn't described that way."
1,the format work awful,"I bought this book in my kindle fire by amazon. The big problem was that the book doesn't look fine, the tables was moved, I swap between pages, and always show the same page. Finally I can read in only one position of the kindle and the small size of letters. I needed to urgent that I didn't return it. It was a waste of money because after the week I finally bought the pdf in the O'Reilly web page."
5,Sed & Awk on Kindle,As all Oreilly books I have ordered I find them extremely helpful as reference guides and quick lookups. The kindle version makes it more portable on the go. I choose this version as I have been spending a great deal of time flying lately and this version keeps the baggage weight and cost to a minimum.
4,handy book to work with sed and awk commands,"For a developer who needs to understand how sed and awk works and to write something immediately, this book will help. you need not remember intricacies of sed and awk commands. just use this book as a guide and move on with your major work."
5,Amazingly Informative,"This book is perfect to slip into your back pocket, cheap enough to loan out and not get it back and light enough to take it everywhere you go to work with no internet. There is always something I realize I can do with awk and sed when looking at this book, and is always next to my desk."
5,"Good intro to Sed and Awk, plus more","This book had far more information on Sed and Awk than I really wanted to read, but objectively speaking, this book did a fabulous job explaining how to use both. The idea of linking them together in one book seems odd, but the author did a pretty nice job utilizing both. I particularly liked the section on debugging awk because the techniques he explained are very applicable to program debugging in general. I also found the section on regular expressions very clearly written and easy to understand (the best I have seen thus far). I wish I had read this book sooner. Also, to the credit of this book, I saved quite a lot of time recently updating about 90 flat files in seconds using sed. Awk has proven quite useful recently in another project too. Thank you Dale and Arnold!"
3,"Good tutorial, problematic reference","I suppose if the proof of the teaching is in the learning, the authors' idea (in this edition) of interlacing their discussions of Sed and Awk throughout the volume is vindicated, because I am learning easily from the book. Yet this organization detracts seriously from its reference value, especially when one uses the index.You can look up a feature which you need to review, turn to one of the listed pages, begin reading, and then realize that you have no idea which program is being described. While the approach is an interesting experiment, I question whether its benefits are worth such drawbacks. If the authors decide to continue the approach in later edition, a simple device such as different type faces of page references in the index (e.g. Roman for Awk, the more elaborate package, and Italic for Sed) would help relieve this problem."
4,Great book for beginners.,"Just finished it. Great book for beginners, tends to focus a bit on the non-programmer. However, it is revealing, showing you how to automatically edit things you usually do manually. Could have used some exercises, and some special problems at the end of each chapter, so you could practice what you learned in that chapter. Great book otherwise."
4,"Excellent, a must for anyone working with UNIX",The book provides a good intro to sed and awk and regular expressions in general. I recommend it for anyone that spends any time at a shell prompt. Even if you think you know these 2 tools you should give this one a look.
5,"Short, sweet, and to the point.","Just like the rest of the O'Reilly line, it's just what you need if you've a basic clue about the subject but need the specifics."
4,A strong reference for sed and awk users,"It is a quality and authoritiative book. I first learned awk and sed with Ellen Quigleys 'Unix Shells' and found this book to assist with the more complex issues not covered in her book. (Like working with unstructured, dirty data, and defining a template to pull relevant data from the flat file. I didn't use this as a 'start at the beginning and read all the way through it,' like the 'Mastering Regular Expressions' book. This is more of a reference book."
3,The best (only?) book to learn these tools from A to Z,"I had to do some text processing and I wanted to learn sed & awk so I picked this book that is, to my knowledge, the only book completely dedicated to these tools. The chapter on 'advanced' sed programming is very scary because when using 'advanced' sed features, the syntax is cryptic. It is nice to know that these features are there but I want to stay away from them and perhaps use awk or perl for the tasks that would require those 'advanced' features. Still, when you stick with the 'basic' and 'intermediate' sed features, you can do cool things easily in shell scripts.Overall, the book was not thrilling to read but it does a good job to teach you these text processing tools."
5,the best desktop reference,Some good reviews on here -- my only additon is that this book has been the best desktop reference for me. I am constantly referring back to it to answer questions. A MUST HAVE for any novice/intermediate user.
1,Worst item I ever bought at Amazon.,"Seems like used one. Looks dirty on the whole!Comb is skew. Some part of the clipper is even broken!Never never buy anything from this ""Peak Performance""!!It should be marked as ""used ones""."
3,A good idea that does not quite work,"I bought this to keep the floating Koi food pellets out of the pond plants and out of the skimmer. If you only have fish under 6 inches it would probably work. My big Koi hit the food when feeding and knock the pellets out of the ring. I also tried a small Hula Hoop and an 8 ft piece of garden water hose and the same thing happened, with each one. Easier to turn the skimmer /filter pump for an hour or two till they are finished eating, what was tossed into the pond."
3,Can be Improved,"My little pond has a skimmer, so the floating pallets tend to get sucked into the skimmer box. I bought this ring in hope to contain the pallets. It sort of worked, but my 6 inch hungry kois kept moving the ring around and jumped all over it. So sometimes pallet can get out, and the ring can move in front of the skimmer blocking it. It's not working ideally for me. I don't know any way but to fasten it with a string, which is unsitely. The ring is not big enough. Right now I had put it away until my lillie pads appear, and the ring might work better between lillie pads to secure it."
2,small,i found this item too small.it did not float without adding some styofoamthe food would get pushed over the top from the fishfighting over the small space provided for the food.
5,floating feeding station ring,worked well for the few times I have used it. Kept a clear area for the neighbor to feed the fish while we were away.
5,The Best of her Classic Routines,"This video, billed as Ms. Russell's ""First Farewell Concert,"" features almost all of her best routines including: a lecture in her series ""Wind Instruments I Have Known,"" ""How to Write Your Own Gilbert & Sullivan,"" and ""The history of the Folksong."" Of course, no Anna Russell collection would be complete without her analysis of Wagner's ""Ring der Nibelungen."" Creating great parody requires even greater knowledge of the subject being parodied, and Anna Russell, having studied at the Royal College of Music, is well qualified. The only other routine I would have liked to see on this tape would be ""Introduction to the Concert (By the Women's Club President)."" Truly classic Anna Russell! I'm glad this only the ""First"" farewell condert. I'm looking forward to many more. P.S.-- During the last folksong, look for a famous newscaster in the audience."
4,Anna Russell's Farewell is bittersweet,"I know Anna Russell exclusively from earlier audio-only recordings which I have listened to many times and practically memorized. While it was terrific for me to see the ole gal in action, she is clearly not ""up to speed"" and the result is more sentimental than otherwise. Still I recommend her as one of the ""greats"" who has not had nearly enough American exposure. God Bless Her Majesty of Mirth."
3,ANNA RUSSELL... A FUNNY LADY,"I have listened for years to Anna Russell's great monologues of Wagner's operas or Gilbert & Sullivan's operettas,etc... and I thought that seeing her on DVD would be a bonus... But although she was entertaining, I think that I prefer the audio cassettes and let my imagination draw the pictures..."
5,musical humor,"Anna Russell at her most hilarious. Contains, among other things, the Ring Cycle. No matter how many times one plays this, one laughs and laughs."
2,Amazon.com,"ANNA RUSSEL (The first Farewell Concert)I had requested ""Anna Russell Sings! Again? with John Coveart at the piano.Recorded in New York Town Hall 1953This DVD is a much older version of a tired entertainer, recorded in a small theatre in Baltimore Museum. No back grownd, small audience. Really on the last throws of her career. Not entertaining, poor sound reproduction.I give it one star only because of remembering Anna Russell twenty-five years younger. This DVD belongs IN a museum."
2,Must have been the era it was made,"This edition is a mess. Dalton over acts and is creepy. The rest of the cast is fine, the direction and screenplay is poor. watch the 1939 version instead."
1,dreadful,"dont even bother with this version, it is absolutely dreadful. The black & white original is the only way to go."
3,ok,"I looked everywhere for this movie because I saw clips of it on youtube. But honestly, all of the good parts are on those clips. There isn't much to more brag about. I just loved the chemistry in the 2007 version too much to compare it to this one. I did love the love scenes, I just wish they had a bit more of it. Its a shame too because I'm obsessed with Timothy Dalton."
1,"A boring, poorly acted, blandly directed, totally lifeless film.","Most of the good reviews for this film are from fans of the book, who swallow their pride and FORGIVE quite a lot, simply for the privilege to see these characters come to life in film once again. The other good reviews seem to be from the Timothy Dalton fan club.Anyone approaching this film without having read the book, will be bored out of their mind. This truly is an awful film. The direction is stale and the acting is over the top. The viewer will not feel invested in ANY of the characters. Total rubbish!My advice? Read the book. And then DON'T make excuses for poorly made films.JM"
3,Book Better than the Movie,"After having read Wuthering Heights, I watched the movie. Although the movie was really good for a classic black and white, I must say that the book (like a lot of other book-based movies) was better than the movie. However, the movie did follow the storyline fairly well, unlike most other books. Furthermore, as somber a setting that this book outlines, it is a classic that I will read again. I loved the story, and definitely would suggest this as an educational literature piece."
5,Very good!,"It is difficult to find old movies like this one in Mexico, the movie arrived on time and has subtitles! Excellent!"
1,What is everyone raving about?,"This movie is nothing like the book. In fact it's insulting to true fans. I especially didn't like the implication that Cathy was having Heathcliff's baby. The characters in the book were very bold and highstrung, but not to the point of adultery. Watch the either the original MGM classic or the version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes instead."
5,CROSSED LOVERS ON THE MOORS,I SAW THIS IN 1970 WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT.. AND WAS TOTALLY STRICKEN... THE MUSIC BY MICHELE LEGRAND IS BREATHTAKING.. AND I HAVE YET TO SEE A FINER HEATHCLIFFE THAN A VERY YOUNG TIMOTHY DALTON.. THE TWO CHARACTERS OF CATHY AND HEATHCLIFFE KEPT ME SPELLBOUND AND I AM SOOOO LOOKING FOR THE SOUNDTRACK BUT HAVE YET HAD NO LUCK.. USED TO HAVE IT. AND PLAYED IT DEATH.. LOL... ANYWAY.. THIS IS A HAUNTINGLY BEATIFUL STORY AND DONE VERY VERY WELL..
2,Not like the book,"Dalton indeed plays a great Heathcliff; the scenery is perfect. But, alas, this is yet another film adaptation that butchers the book. There is no Lockwood, there is no Linton, there is no Cathy Linton, there is no Haerton. The entire third generation is dropped...AND...in the movie, Hindley kills Heathcliff. In the book it is pretty much the other way around. Oh well. The first hour is kind of close to the book. My advice: stick to the book."
4,Timothy Dalton is a great Heathcliff,"I was very intrigued to see this version of ""Wuthering Heights,"" especially because Timothy Dalton plays Heathcliff (and he also plays Rochester in my favorite adaptation of ""Jane Eyre""). Certainly he does the spirit and passion of the Bront sisters justice in both movies.Although it's definitely worth viewing, I can't give this film the highest rating for a couple of reasons: 1) It strays so far from the book--especially at the end regarding Heathcliff's fate--that it's jarring if you know the story well; 2) Anna Calder-Marshall's performance as Catherine is a bit too loony. At times, she's so kooky and wild-eyed that she isn't the least bit attractive.Still, the locations are effective, and the windy moors disturbing and realistic. And Dalton is mesmerizing. I would have liked to have seen the script go into more detail and stick more faithfully to the book. I think the definitive version of ""Wuthering Heights"" is yet to be made."
5,Gorgeous: Wuthering Heights AND Timothy fans don't miss this,"I picked this up after admiring Timothy Dalton's work in the BBC version of Jane Eyre. I adore the Olivier version of Heathcliff, but I have to say Dalton is absolutely superb, mesmerizing and INTENSE in this role(!!!). I'm usually not one to confess this sort of thing but I admit he had my knees knocking throughout, YOWSA. The movie is darkly beautiful with a gorgeous musical score and breathtaking landscapes- haunting as it should be, especially for a ""70's movie"". Yes Cathy could have been cast differently but I still think she does a fine enough job, and is believable. If you love Wuthering Heights and Timothy Dalton this is a MUST have version to pick up."
3,Wuthering Heights (1970),It was OK. I expected more of of an in-depth story......I have read other comments about how much editing was done.I have purchased another version of Wuthering Heights and will compare.
2,Different Portrayal,"Other than the fact, that Timothy Dalton(being handsome and young), was in this remake, the movie lacked the strong straight forward storyline and superb acting of the Oliver version of which my husband an I much prefer."
4,Unusual :),I really kinda liked this version of wuthering heights...it was unusual and different from all of the others. Not really my favorite..but still entertaining.
2,I Saw This Movie for the First and Last Time in 1970,"Timothy Dalton was very pretty to look at with the most gorgeous green eyes. He was about 25 then (born 1944-- senior citizen now, can you believe it!) The scenery and the costuming were good. For the rest, it was a very dull movie due to the bland script and uninspired acting. This screen adaptation of the movie was geared more toward trying to recreate the enthusiasm that surrounded Romeo and Juliet (1968) than exploring the overwrought dark romanticism of the book Wuthering Heights.This might be the version to recommend to Twilight fans who are interested in Wuthering Heights due to the Meyer seal of romantic approval."
3,"Kept To Plot--But, Disappointing Ending","For Timothy Dalton's performance alone, I should have given this movie 5 stars. Dalton's devilish dark good looks, and the way he brought out Heathcliff's passion, rage, and fury, rendered him the best Heathcliff I have ever seen portrayed on screen. You could see the evil in him and the VIOLENCE frightens you. The movie's music and scenery gives one a taste of life in the English moors. And, I was impressed with watching details from the book. But, the movie lacked real passion and drama, and overall emotion and feeling that the 1992 version exuded. Too, since this movie did not keep to the original plot, like the 1939 and the 1992 versions,--And ended with Heathcliff being shot (What? Heathcliff was never SHOT in the book!) I have to say that I did not thoroughly enjoy this movie."
5,Excellent book,"As a quality engineer for Xerox Mexicana, application of DOE and RSM is part of the day-to-day activities. This book is an excellent tutor to apply RSM. Highly recommended."
5,"""BLENDED FAMILY BOOK PROVES TO BE INVALUABLE""","This book is AWESOME!!I can't think of a better book to put into the hands of relatives or friends intertwined in blended family positions. It's honesty and encouragement make it a MUST have.I believe that this is a book that will benefit the entire family.Packed with encouragement, possibilities, and truth. It's wonderful to see a book finally written with a biblical point on this subject. This author nailed it! The subject is a ""touchy"" one and yet MUST be discussed in order for all families to heal and unite!I would highly recommend this book & workbook to all that are in blended situations like us."
1,Dont waste your money unless a prof tells you that you must,"Seriously, ask the prof to reconsider using the text- not at all helpful for an intro to law class.... there are many other texts out there MUCH more helpful and much more clear!"
3,"Classic Canterbury, but too formless","This album is made up of some '73 demos (which actually sound pretty good, liner-note protestations about sound quality notwithstanding) and some radio recordings from '74 and '75. (Oddly, the two '74 tracks are mono). The playing and musicianship are first rate. However: Dave Stewart pointed out that he left National Health at one point because Alan Gowen wanted the band to move in a more ""free"" direction. Hearing this, I can understand those protestations. The compositions are lacking in depth and complexity, with perhaps the exception of the title track, which is only 2 minutes long anyway."
4,Acid Mothers Temple & The Cosmic Inferno - 'Demons From Nipples' (Vivo),"Another trippy release, from none other than the notorious Japanese space-noise rockers - Acid FREAKING Mothers Temple! 'Demons From Nipples' is every bit as good as most of the other numerous releases they've unleashed upon us. Like several other ATM efforts, you get just two tracks, the title cut ""Demons From Nipples"" (39:10) features plenty of acidic guitar shredding and bubbling synthesizer and ""5 Second Demon"" (12:48) is a bit heavier but still accomplishes the very same goal of scrabbling your brain cells. Worthy of repeated plays. Glue sniffers, stoners, hop heads, late night dreamers, stagnant slackers and aging hippies - REJOICE! Your day has finally come."
4,"One year, no problems","I use this everyday w/o the guard to keep a short stubble. It works great. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's kinda thin and tapered toward the bottom so I found it a little small to hold. Maybe I have big, clunky hands, I dunno. I did drop it into the empty bathroom sink once early on, but it survived w/o noticeable impact on its operation. I'd buy another if they still sold it."
4,best shaver,i have been looking for shaver that doesnt cut my skin and im glad i found it. this has been the best shaver for me.
1,Not worth it at any price.,"I can't explain the satisfaction of the previous reviewer other than his trimmer came from a different batch or factory. My Remington MB-10 recently died after a good, long life and I would buy that trimmer again if it were available. Replaced it with the MB-20. After the difficult task of removing it from the perma-package, I found it to be much cheaper quality than the old trimmer. The battery cover won't stay in place when attempting to turn it on and the switches are rediculously difficult to move. Shouldn't be that hard to turn on and off or adjust. Poor design and poor build quality. Not sure what happened to Remington as it feels like a cheap toy. Back to Amazon it goes."
3,Pink Sun Protectors/sun screen,"I received the wrong color initially and had to return them. The ""glasses"" are cute as can be, but the baby refuses to wear them. Great idea in theory, but didn't work for us."
1,Too Big for Baby,I was disappointed with the fit of these sunglasses. My daughter was 2 1/2 months old when I bought them and she has an average-sized head. They were way too big and wouldn't stay on her face. There's only a short run of velcro for adjustability so I put them away for next year....hopefully they'll fit!
3,"Starts divisive, gets better","My initial response to the first two chapters of the book was ""bunk!"" As a member of a ""minority"" group, I protest the characterizations made about how we ""minorities"" feel we are treated... Once the book moved on to workers with disabilities, older workers, and foreign workers, I think the focus went off trying to rile up the potentially disgruntled workers, and the second half the book was well worth reading. As a manager, I found the exercises and self-scoring evaluations valuable.I would recommend the book to others, but I might also recommend that in future editions, it would be worthwhile to tone down the aggressiveness against white men in the first two chapters."
2,Pretty harsh about the white,"I was assigned this book for a class, and I must admit, I was interested in the topic. Finding ways to promote cultural diversity is a must in the business setting, and with that in mind, I dove into the book.I was surprised at how viciously anti-white-male the first few chapters of this book were. By the time the topic moved from ethnic minorities and women to people with disabilities, the attitude toned down somewhat, but I considered the first two chapters provocative and hostile.It's a shame that a fine text about cultural diversity begins with such a high degree of discontent and anger. Once the tone of anger subsided, the book was a worthwhile read.I think the merits of the book, promoting understanding and non-discriminatory and non-stereotyped attitudes and actions in the workplace, were overshadowed by the *very* discriminatory and stereotyped view of the white male worker.(I am not a white male)"
4,"For Your Own Good, Make It A ""Package Purchase""!","If you're going to buy this DVD, PLEASE buy the book as well! If you really want to learn these techniques (as well as they can be learned from books and videos, anyway) you need the in-depth explanations the book offers and THEN see them performed on video.The only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars is that I'm now spoiled by having Dr. Yang personally taking the viewer through his later videos in such great detail that you don't even NEED a book! I also really like it when he has some of his students attempt to perform the techniques, which he then critiques. You will not find that on this video, which is basically a cleaned-up VHS transfer from the 80's.Having said all the above, do I recommend that you buy this DVD? Yes, but only if you BUY THE BOOK as well!"
4,I Like Echo Park - the neighborhood,"The movie itself isn't bad, but what I like best is the locale. Echo Park is a neighborhood that, while it might not be the safest place, has a lot of character. I also enjoyed watching a younger Tom Hulce work with an offbeat script. The ending is too abrupt and the movie gets rather bizarre at times, but at least it is unique. And it is more unique in a good, rather than bad sense."
1,Not Worth Paying For,"Plot made no sense as far as character motivation. Thought it was a ""period piece"" but costumes and weapons were not even close. Might entertain dumb Christians desiring anti-devil violence. Didn't even watch half of it. I want my money back..."
2,It is worth .99 cents only,The movie was worth the .99 cents I paid to rent it. Don't go in with high expectations. Low budget film with a few recognizable actors.
3,Ok Plot,This movie is only ok.I rented it because my brother and I wanted to see a movie and after browsing for a few minutes we stumbled on this movie. After seeing the rating which was an average of 4 stars and seeing the preview we decided to give it a shot.While the plot had some promise and the special effects were good. I found that shortly after the introduction I started to get a little bored with the movie. I found the entire movie to be very predictable. They did fill in some back story as the movie progressed but it seemed to be more of an after thought so things in the movie wouldn't be so confusing.Had the average rating only been 3 stars or less I wouldn't of even given this movie a shot which is why I'm writing this review and warning other people.
3,run of the mill movie,"It was okay overall. Acting, special effects, photography, and sets were interesting and a notch above okay. The plot seemed like it was from a comic book."
2,"Starts with promise, but doesn't fulfill","This could have been a really good movie, but the story doesn't hold up. I lost interested by midpoint. Disappointed."
1,If you wanted something better than van helsing this is not it,"Everyone who gave this 4 or 5 stars must have been really in the mood for any quality of movie. Solomon Kane borrows heavily from many movies and unfortunately borrowed the bad parts. Lots of action, special effects, dramatic music, but in the end, you really don't care about anyone you are introduced to. Quality of story/acting/effects is lower than league of extraordinary gentlemen (and that is not a good thing). I'm still rather amazed I didn't turn it off.Incidentally, if you wanted to see what a lava like transformer looks like.. its in the last 5 minutes (don't expect it to do anything exciting though)."
1,bad bad bad studio,This nonsense that the movie is only for a select few and notwidespread. I live in Mexico (this has proven to be the biggest mistake of my life) and movies are hard to get here. The studio that produced this movie should be shot for their inconsideration for people.
5,Solid,"was full of action and right up my alley. I like to watch movies with this type of character. Warrior, hero,...etc. One of those movies you really do not want to end but you know its going to. I would watch it again."
3,Not well used Special Effects,"James Purefoy was reason we kept going back to finish the movie. Having it available for home viewing was reason we bought a ticket. Character has series promise with such a different era & potential for visual play on the screen, but special effects did not satisfy - too easily predicted. Can't say how much dissatisfaction was poor imagination in script interpretation or creativity."
3,"Meh, not bad, not good.","Pretty generic medieval-esq action movie, nothing really stands out about it as great, and nothing as too terrible either. Definitely only worth a rental in my opinion."
5,Great ride from start to finish. would like to more of Solomon's story!!!,"Action, very believable story line. Made you believe in witches and the power they held over people of that time and why we fear them to this day. Hope, Solomon gave you hope. How God takes what we might consider a sinner and turns him in to a weapon against evil. Just a damn good movie...."
3,"Not Bad, Not Remarkable","All the elements of a good medieval sword fight flick, but very little depth or detail. There was a little more dialogue than fight scenes, too. I can say that it has piqued my interest to consider reading the book."
4,Good movie,"I gave the movie 4 stars because it was engaging, adventurous, and exactly what the trailer sugested. The acting was good, and the did not lose their accents after a few scenes. If you like historical movies with demons, magic, and brooding, repenting heros; then this is your movie."
2,"start was good, i guess book was better","start of the movie was good but as the movie progresses everything fell apart, worst is the ending not much of a fight scene and special effects was lacking"
4,sk,"i like it, but ive had it for over a year, kinda confused how its just hitting theaters but hey whatever lol"
2,So much potential so much waste.,"I saw this movie for what it could have been. Filled to the brim with often shoddy acting and very course and unrealistic special effects. The story is somewhat decent, but could have been delivered much better. I wish we could see a remake of this somewhere down the line."
4,nice conversion,"IT's rare for a filmic version of a comics persona/series - much less a classic of the ""pulp"" novels of the early 20th Century - to keep the feel of the original intact. While it has some flaws, Solomon Kane manages to absorb the viewer as the novel does and yet bring some of the ""telegraphic"" feel of the comic as well. If you want a nice escape from reality on a rainy afternoon, this is a good choice. It ain't great art, but that's not what one should expect of fantasy-adventure. Purefoy is believable, the bad guys are really bad, the good guy is conflicted and therefore interesting, and the production is lush with nice special effects and a whole lot of wicked costuming."
4,Good Entertainment,"I give it 4 stars because of a few nice unexpected twists in the ending. It's not a 5 star, but if I could, I'd give it 4.5. It opens great but drags a bit through the middle before they get on with it. Some of it was just a little too predictable. The fight choreography is decent, no complaints there."
2,This movie,"I was in shock how lame this movie was. It missed the boat not having Elvira hosting it. I have seen more impressive horror from Borris Karloff, which is saying something. The character is so self absorbed George Clooney should have been cast."
3,Solomon Kane (Watch While It's In Theatres),It was not the best I have seen but it was good entertainment. I would not buy but was ok to rent/
3,I was expecting more,"Not a terrible movie it just seemed like it never got a sense of itself. I expect undeveloped plot in an action flick, but under developed fight scenes, too.Well, it was 6$."
4,Purefoy is awesome,I'm a big fan of Purefoy. He's a natural badass. Great as Marc Anthony in rome and Ironclad. He's good with this genre.
3,Ol' Jimmie does a good job,This movie has a great cast that does a good job. The editing is what kept this movie from being really good. Purefoy was awesome in his slightly wooden way as the comic book lead.
3,There's something missing,The movie seemed to be missing key parts. I felt like I was watching a movie from the middle of the story.
4,Great travel movie!,"Looking for something to kill the time while traveling? This is worth the rental fees. Great effects, reasonable story line and decent acting."
3,Not a big budget movie but good actors and directing,"Worth watching if you like fantasy action movies and be pleasantly surprised by finding true character development. Not a great movie by any means, but better then much of the drivel out there."
3,another old world sci fi movie,"They plot was average for this kind of movie.it was more a redemption movie with special effects. The I don't want to be bad but I have to,to save the world kind of thing. The streaming for this movie was more a problem than the movie itself. Which is kinda strange for Amazon."
3,"An ""OK"" movie","I downloaded this movie out of curiosity, the story seemed to be at least interesting. I didn't dislike the movie at all, but the story seemed to drag along. An ""OK"" movie, not a great one, just my opinion."
1,Terrible Movie Waste of money and time,Terrible Movie Waste of money and time. Horrible acting I wish I could get a refund. The story line was extremely lame
2,Very choppy plot line,"and predictable. Glad I didn't pay to see it in theatres. Movie might have been better with better actors, director and someone who could edit."
3,Is this really a 4 star movie? Hmmmmm,"First of all, I cannot agree with everyone else who gave this movie an average of 4 stars,it is simply NOT that good.It is extremely predictable. Nothing new at all in this movie, it clearly copies some from the Lord of the ring series.It even has a Balrog type demon at the very end that the star of the movie has to fight.I am not saying the movie is terrible either, I am giving it a solid 3 stars.The acting was fine, the special effects were fine, the story line was a little interesting.If you want to see a decent 3 star movie with lots of Med-evil action fighting in it, swords, sorcery,demons, witches etc etc etc definitely rent this movie."
2,not a great movies sorry,the plot was ridiculous and the story line was over all very very slow its pace was sleepy and i lost interest after the first 20 minutes the story line is very very predictable girl get kidnapped girl gets rescued bla bla bla dont waste your money
3,Had potential...,This movie had potential because of a somewhat unique plot; however the ending was abrubt and did not feature the epic final battle that I was expecting.
2,Not so fast,I really like movies of this type but Solomon Kane was too slow paced throughout and the acting wasn't believable.
3,For fans only.,"I enjoyed it enough, but this is my type of movie. Action fantasy, magic and monsters. The acting and the dialogue leave much to be desired, but we have all seen much worse.I thought the sets, costumes, and make-up work were excellent, maybe even convincing.Certainly not a movie for everyone, but if Robert E. Howard's name is familiar to you, you should find something enjoyable here."
3,okay for an evening entertainment,"This movie isn't bad, but it also isn't great. It's got some entertaining moments and is a decent film for fantasy/adventure fans."
2,boooo,"I LOVE James Purefoy, and this movie was almost unwatchable. I also love this genre of film, but it missed the mark somehow."
1,dont waste your time,"really bad writing, stupid cgi and a total waste of a few hours. Worst story line and really bad effects...gross brutal yucky"
4,pretty good,Decent story line and great special effects.could have used a little more character development.overall a pretty good movie.HD format a must.
3,Good flick!,This was worth watching. You must love zombie/ vampirish type stuff to like this though. Plenty of action and gore.
3,Solomon Kane,"The movie Solomon Kane, was average (not bad/not great). For $3.99 its cheaper than going to the theater and worth the time to watch."
3,"Great Movie, Tragic Availability!","This is an Awesome Movie! I am a bigtime REH fan and although this might not be word for word Howard text, personally I believe it accuratly embodies the spirit of Solomon Kane. I love it.UNFORTUNANTLY!!! For whatever lame reason this has not been released in Theaters or on DVD in America. So what do you do?I bought the UK version trying to be legit and all, and although its real nicely packaged, it is no better than any of the high quality Peer to Peer versions available for download. The disc itself is a little less than 4 gigs and the bitrate is unimpressive.My advice is to either wait till someday it does come out in America and then buy it (hopefully a better copy) or buy the Blu-Ray Disc for twice the money and assume that its of better production quality.I dont fault the seller, but the manufactuer."
2,Dark but Decent Entertainment,"Definitely worth watching. A lot of action and 15th century B.S. about God and the Devil. If it were true, they certainly could not be defeated by swords. It's worth a watch but I wouldn't set my hair on fire hurrying to get it.Dark and confusing plot. Leaves a lot of holes to the imagination. It is all a strange Devonshire movie with heavy accents and two bit metal and amazingly accurate flintlocks, which had not been invented yet, used to kill.Generally makes no sense, but Good wins over Evil as always. I would wait until it is Prime Free."
4,"Very, very good",I highly recommend this picture. Good character who did bad things but was redeemed. I'm glad I rented this pic.
4,Purefoy is great!,James Purefoy is one of my favorite actors and he did not disappoint in this movie. I expected a very campy movie and was surprised by the grittiness and darkness that I like in a fantasy genre movie. I recommend this.
3,3.5 Stars,"I like this genre, anyway. The plot is good. There was just something about the main actor that really didn't pull me in. At least to me, the main actor doesn't have that persona other actors doing this same genre have that make you relate to him, cheer for him, identify with him, etc..."
2,Nope,This was borderline from a recommendation but in the end this movie was just not cutting it. The acting was ok and the story was ok but it just did not deliver that captivating presentation.
4,Bought dang time we had a good sword and sorcery tale again,Special effects were cool. Some parts were predictable but it was a good story. Basically its about a warrior who escapes his fate with the Devil and turns to the light but has to return to what he knows in order to save someone. Lots of magic and swordplay. It is unique in that it also involves black powder weapons.
3,not as good as t could have been,"I love James Purefoy. This movie was okay, it had good scenes, and the stroy line was okay. But not as good as so many other of his projects."
3,Solomon Kane,"Solomon Kane, is An also ran movie. I would not view this movie again. You should charge 0.99 cents and no more. Thank You"
3,Okay movie.,This was a good flick to watch action gore demons witches etc. etc. it has been done before but this was entertaining.
4,Outstanding blend of swords and sorcery,"I stumbled across this movie while surfing through Amazon, having not even heard of it in the theaters. And was I pleasently surprised. The story flows very well and the special effects are just right, not over the top and not cheesy. The protagonist is well defined and sympathetic. James Purefoy does a wonderful job showing a wide range of emotions and plays the tortured, reluctant hero very well. I was a joy to watch and one that I will probably buy and add to my collection."
2,"Special effects pretty good. But story just hokey, cliched, the devil's reaper- just random.","The story just doesn't make sense, the bad guys aren't compelling characters, not really 16th century or 21st century versions of evil, but a mixture of the worst of both worlds."
1,Bought by accident - Be careful what U click on,"We bought this by accident thinking it was an Amazon Prime streaming movie. When we realized we had bought it, we put it in our list to watch later, not realizing it had a 48 hour view time. Be careful what you click on."
2,Boarderline Awful,"I think the online price for this was high; however, I am glad I did not pay to see this in a theater. It was plodding and the only value in watching was some of the special effects and costumes. I doubt if this film will be in theaters long."
2,"Mediocre story, cool sword fights","Watchable, but only just barely. The movie is a series of plot points jammed into 140 minutes, not a clear or interesting story. Cool looking castles, lots and lots of rain, and a very mediocre story."
3,Entertaining,"They left definite room for Soloman Kane II. I'm glad I got to see this for the price for the movie started to lose me about 30 minutes in. It's typical, the damsel in distress, redemption, and I can never stop being me syndrome. I will probably not rent this again."
3,Solomon Kane,Good movie but not a great one. It was on the edge of being a great movie but the extra ingredient was not there.
3,Not bad but not great either,"Lots of action in a whirlwind fantasy tale that is all over the place .. devils, demons, witches, super warrior and more. Not gonna be a candidate for movie of the year by any stretch of the imagination but at least keeps your attention."
3,OK if you have nothing to do and money to throw away!,"OK movie for a slow weekend. A poor mans version of Lord of the Rings & King of Throwns, with the latter two coming out on top by alot."
5,great action!,I loved the choreography of the fights and would love to watch it again. I just hate to have to keep renting it online and hope a copy is available to purchase in the USA soon.
4,Good not great,I enjoyed this movie for a one time watch. The story was engaging enough to keep me interested and it had enough action to keep me watching. I don't regret renting it but would never watch it again.
4,Gritty Action,"I actually really liked this movie and wish it was possible to give 1/2 star ratings. James Purefoy is as entertaining as ever, although the Director seems to have lost his vision a bit in the last 1/4th of the movies. It felt rushed at the end. Overall, however, it was good and I enjoyed it enough to recommend this to anyone who likes graphic novel productions for the big screen. I will probably buy it as well."
4,Kane,"This movie completely surprised me. I was expecting the usual cheap b movie quality, just for fun movie, but I got a serious tale of a man finding redemption when he didn't want it. The acting raised the quality of the film.It is possible you would have to have read the books to get into this version of Solomon Kane and for those who have, give it a go. I think you will be pleased."
2,"Is it just me, or was anyone else dissapointed?","Well, this is awkward. I thought this movie was going to be epic. The trailer had me pumped up to enjoy a dark action flick. I think after they made the trailer, they fired their graphics and special effects department, along with a few producers, and whoever was responsible for creating names for the supporting characters. I couldn't get past how the devil, was simply referred to as ""the devil"". Of all the demonic names and evil references the one entity that should be feared by all, is called 'the devil'. It doesn't help he looks like the grim reaper from Courage the dog. I really wish I could have finished the movie, but I was too disappointed and could predict every scene. I highly recommend you watch ANOTHER movie."
2,meh,"After seeing him as Marc Anthony in HBO's Rome I was excited to see Solomon Kane but it kinda rips off other movies and yet not in an interesting way. I was bored with it really, not worth watching it the first time."
2,Slow,"This started off pretty good, but got caught up in it's own hubris. I would not recommend this to anyone but the most diehard of fans."
2,Skip It!!!!!,"Classic redemption story although the characters are majorly underdeveloped. Casting seemed strong but cannot makeup for the lazy storytelling & predictable plot twists. There's a reason they are showing this ""before its in theaters"", because it sucks!"
2,Solomon Drain,"What a waste! I will admit I was taken in by earlier previews, hoping for a fast paced escape adventure film. And there are a few good action sequences, but as an over all film it just didn't deliver. If you've seen Nicholas Cages' Season of the Witch, then you've seen a far better picture! Stop there, before you're forced to re-watch it to get the taste of Solomon Kane out of your mouth."
1,What a waist of money,What a waist of money. This movie was so stupid. The acting sucked. You people that gave high ratings should be ashamed of your selfs.
5,Great action movie,I can't believe this movie never got a theatrical release in the U.S. Or a dvd/bluray release either! The made up backstory is not Robert E. Howard but once you get past that it's very much in the REH vein. This asian all region disc is decent but now I really want a good bluray.
4,Good sword & sorcery,I thought this was a great little sword and sorcery flick. I have only a passing acquaintance with Robert E. Howard so I was not offended by any changes that needed to be made to make this movie work. The action's good with some rather excellent fight scenes. You like the lead character once he allows his inner badass to reemerge. Good popcorn movie for the sword swinger fan.
5,Solomon Kane,I just happen to find previews of Solomon Kane on YouTube. It immediately captured my interest. It took some time to find it but when I did it was amazing. It was compared to VanHelsing but I totally disagree. This movie has a darker tone to it and it continued throughout the whole movie. I have always loved the lead actor in this movie and he did not fail to produce. This movie is worth seeing.
5,Solomon kane was good,my husband loved this movie and was still talking of it the next morning after i fell asleep on the movie lol. Not that the movie was borrying but i fall asleep on all the movies.
3,"Great effects, moments of sincerity","For a special effects, gothic movie with an attempt at a religious theme, it has some sincere moments but in the end the predictability is less than satisfying."
4,An earthy action movie from days of yore,A good story of evil and then revenge that will make you feel satisfied. A bit of fantasy and supernatural mumbo jumbo but a fun popcorn eating movie.
4,Good....But not great.,"Great special effects. Decent story....The script wasn't all that great. They could have developed the villain's character better, but 4 stars for the special effects and fight scenes."
4,Not bad at all,I heard the movie was go and they were right. It was a solid story. The plot was predictable but not a hindrance to enjoying the movie. The acting was solid from all participants. Decent special effects that were not heavy handed. Give it a try.
4,Great fantasy action,"I was really impressed with the supernatural swashbuckling action of this flick. Fun special effects, simple but enchanting story, really does the dance of action horror and fantasy at once really well. Good to see more literary heroes being brought to life in such a well produced way. Really liked it."
3,Too scared to sleep,"This book was difficult for me to rate. It was very scary, but I hated the ending. I wanted a better explanation of what happened. I felt like she was in a hurry to meet her deadline and just ended it!"
4,The Counter Terrorism Puzzle,This book was in great shape just as described. Also the shipping was incredibly speedy!
2,Wayyyyyyyyy too tame to be called erotica,"Each of the stories in this collection are excellently written short stories exploring sexuality. But, as for erotica, I found them way too tame. I am a woman and I need ""foreplay"" even in my sexy reading, but I also need some action. I have kept this book by my bed, giving it a second chance several times, and every time, I am completely disappointed. The ""good parts"" are too few and far between."
4,yet another well written.....hot book!,"another excellent book in the herotica anthology. i have them all and this edition focuses on relationships and what can come out of them. these stories are written by women, and only serve to bridge the gap between the media image of women and the reality of what women want, see and do. i will never be able to look at a widow the same way after ""mourning the peasant""."
2,Disappointing.,"I picked this up on the strength of earlier Herotica collections, which I enjoyed. I wish I'd read the publisher's notes more carefully: despite the editor brightly commenting on how hot these stories are about ...committed relationships, I really didn't want to read an anthology limited to that.I was utterly horrified by ""Mourning the Peasant""; it started out dull, then when I realized the narrator was actually going to sleep with her father's lover, I just skipped to the next story. There were actually a couple of dull stories in this anthology. The only reason I haven't relegated my copy to the thrift store pile is the story ""Three Note Harmony,"" a rather hot MMF threesome tale."
3,To watch once...,"have you ever seen ""Lamberto Bava`s Blade in the dark"" (very good movie for thriller fans). Well... this ""foto di gioia"" tried to get the same attention... failing.The movie is not really bad, some murder scenes are quite good (bad acting maybe?) but like Dario Argento said to me once ""Why should i make a movie if it is going to be forgettable? Its a waste of time!"".If you have a free afternoon to spend you can always watch it :)"
3,Southwestern Rue,"I was very happy to see the subject matter covered. In the world of gardening, too few books are dedicated to the southwest garden - especially along the foot of the rocky mountains. And this author includes information for a world awake and ready to greener techniques.This is a comprehensive book filled with lots of technical information. But unfortunately, the pictures are small and mostly placed in the edges of the pages. Much to my surprise, more than a few pictures are blurred; Who's the publisher? Well that's the consolation. I am hoping the appendix on plantings is worth the price. Would have loved pictures of those. I'll have to trust google for that. The book is not for the weekend landscaper looking for quick shortcuts."
5,Gardening through for a drought,"Albeit I could not address the design ideas from this book into my own landscape conversion because of the archictectual design of my home. I have a number of ""natural"" gardeners that have embraced this book and the ideas it offers. This book will help fill in the need for beauty and plant ideas in the coming drought years. This is a sister book to""Plants for Natural Gardens: Southwestern Native & Adaptive Trees, Shrubs, Wildflowers & Grasses""."
1,"Creating Comic Characters- Poor Content, Deceiving Title","The title says 'Creating Comic Characters' what anyone would understand as drawing head, body and limbs of a created entity. But do not expect that here, instead this book spends 95% of its content on drawing faces, faces and faces.Some creative planning and drawing is briefly discussed but unfortunately the content doesn't surpass the surface. Nothing like 'maintaining the look coherence of a character from different points-of-views' or 'how to apply proportion and disproportion in characters', etc...The book lacks consistency and would benefit readers if it used a set of defined characters and how they could be changed under different techniques, styles and all that stuff you really want to know.If you are interested in the French Revolution this book might prove to be useful though: not even books on the subject will provide such a galore of cut off heads."
5,Great movie,"This film is many years ahead of its time. Great thriller, great actors, great film, what else can I say?! See it!"
3,In Cold Blood,Though violent and unimaginable the Depiction for history is excellent. No more violence for children to watch in the future
4,True to book,An engrossing enactment of the events leading up to and following the horrific and senseless murders of a Kansas farm family. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson looked eerily similar to photos of the men they portrayed.
5,In Cold Blood,"Based on the best-selling exposé by Truman Capote, which told the story of the real-life November 15, 1959, slaying, Brooks's gritty, realistic docudrama offers an unflinching look at the perpetrators of a nonsensically horrific crime. Scott Wilson couldn't be better as the coldly manipulative Hickock. And Blake, in his breakout role, delivers the best performance of his career, playing a brutal psychopath- more than a trifle spooky, given the dramatic events Blake's later life. Filmed in stark black-and-white by Oscar nominee Conrad Hall, ""Blood"" is a harrowing masterpiece of true crime."
5,must see movie,"Saw the movie CAPOTE,got the orginal book IN COLD BLOOD,had to see the movie, again it was good."
5,"Stark, harrowing depiction of murder and its aftermath","This film depicts the murder of a Kansas farm family by a couple of ex-cons (Robert Blake and Scott Wilson) and its aftermath. Writer/director James Brooks, adapting Truman Capote's novel, adopts a stark black-and-white style that gives a sense of heightened realism. Blake and Wilson deliver great performances as a couple losers whose lives of reckless waste result in the ultimate tragedy for four people they had never even met. Brooks and crew do an exceptional job at presenting the kind of half-baked scheming that goes on in impulsive criminal minds, leading to random and senseless crimes that defy understanding by more rational people. As the film goes on, its anti-death-penalty stance becomes clear (most obviously in the juxtaposition of the film's title with its final image), but the ruthlessness of the crime and the skill with which it has been presented undercut this intention."
4,almost perfect,"musically an unopposable masterpiece. 18v throws in all sorts of styles used in the hardcore and metal genre to create quite the hybrid release. this has almost everything: catchy break downs, tech math rock parts, intense grindish parts, eeire black and death metal parts and some really dramatic softer parts. Beyond compare, beyond talented and beyond brutal. The vocals are incredibley bruising and harsh. Definatly the most intense vocals james has managed to produce. This would be a total perfect 5 stars in my opinion with only one reserve, I'm not to big on the lyrics, which are very well written just not my thing really. Great release though, pick it up any chance you get"
4,Descent album,"This is a decent early recording of Eighteen Visions. If you're like me, their newer stuff is a big disapointment. This cd is pretty good, but Vanity is better. After vanity it's all down hill for these guys."
5,ay que calor,they re great musisian... this band is just here since the seventy's and you ear should novv that.great sound and soul and i m not speaking spanish:).5star
4,Making a tile game more stressful!,"This expansion provides a good stress factor to the game of Carcassonne. If you already play the game with the first river expansion, then adding this expansion partway through the game provides a great interruption to people's strategies. By playing a second river, you can easily cut off people's plans for domination of the map.I highly recommend this expansion for the game as it provides a good wrench to throw into your opponents strategies."
3,not really the best choice for an expansion,"I got the rivers free with my purchase of Carcassonne. If I was given the choice today to buy the expansion separately, I would not waste my money on it. The other expansion sets are much more interesting. The Rivers typically just add some length to the game, and make it slightly more challenging by putting a large divide into the game. It's helpful if you're playing with only 2 players, because it makes putting a farmer down on the board a bit more interesting. If you're looking to buy an expansion and you're only buying one, don't buy this one. If you already have other expansions and you're just looking for more variety, this would be a nice addition."
4,Good add-on for Carcassonne,I find that the river expansions help the basic Carcassonne game. The river divides the fields so that it is harder for one person to dominate the end of game scoring for the fields.
5,Awesome!,"I love the original game, and this just makes it all the more fun. The river is much bigger than the original river, and, personally opens up many strategic opportunities, and lengthens the game. It's a must have for lovers of the game."
2,Not a fan of the River,"My guess is that people who like the river are those who always seem to come up short in the fields. To me, sneaking more meaples into the main field is the best part of the game. The river ruins this by making things too congested. It's also a boring start to the game, so there's that too."
3,Missing some key songs,"Most other reviewers hit it right on the money. Though this album did cover some of their best, there were definitely some key songs that were omitted - plus a few others that I would have liked to have included, even if they weren't HIT hit songs - e.g., Time & Chance with an opening by the late, great, Ossie Davis.They should put out a greatest hits part 2 and include some of the other big ones: Forever Love, Let's Start with Forever, etc.- I'd buy it!"
2,Greatest Dodges,"This so-called GREATEST is anything but. Sure it has some key songs like Sex You Up and I Adore, but it's missing key jams like Forever Love, Let's Start With Forever, Slow Motion, The Bells( the Originals remake written by marvin gaye)make you want to use the disc for a beer coaster. Giant Records should know better than to put an unfinished compilation up for sale. Sounds like somebody has it out for these guys not to include ALL their GREATEST."
1,Out with Color Me Badd... in with Megadeth!,"After listening to Symphony of Destruction by Megadeth, I tossed this CD into the garbage. I can't believe I listened to this trash. I wanna sex you up? PLEASE. That is SO 1980s. I'm into new stuff now, and Megadeth is as current as it gets. Oh, and the Color Me Badd CDs are also EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE."
2,Nice clock...when it works,"I purchased this clock after reading favorable reviews. It really is a great value. After receiving, I was impressed by its quality of construction and range of features. Later that day I turned it on again and it displayed the last mode I had used but would not do anything (start, stop, change modes, or even turn off). I had to manually press the little reset button on the bottom. It then appeared to work fine again. The next day, the same thing happened so I exchanged it (thinking I had gotten a lemon). Amazon immediately sent a replacement which exhibited the same behavior. Unfortunately, I had to ask for a refund. There is a serious quality control issue that needs to be addressed before I could recommend this clock."
5,The best clock for tournment chess,We ordered the clock for my grandson (7.5 years old) and hethinks that this is the perfect clock for him.He uses it for his many chess tournament competitionstogether with the tournament chess set we bought him.The delivery was fast and the clock arrived in good condition.
2,Single Shortcoming Ruins this Timer,"This timer was very difficult to set up. Then, after all the trouble, I find that in the 25 minute mode, it only counts down by minutes, not seconds, despite the fact that there are 4 digits available on the display in other modes with countdowns by minutes and seconds. The 25 minute mode is the standard for Scrabble brand game tournaments. For me that's a deal buster. I'm sending the unit back. Fortunately, Amazon makes returns really easy."
4,"Quality clock, good design.","Easy menus. Many options. Good quick shutoff. Heavy, has a quality feel to the device. The buttons light up, which is a cool."
4,"Sturdy chess clock, UI could be simpler","I got this chess clock for only $25 and it's a great value. Very sturdy, and won't break with frequent or forceful use.That said, the UI for changing time control settings is kinda difficult to navigate."
1,Complicated!,"I thought this chess clock would be simple to set-up and use. For me, this one is far too complicated. I spent over an hour trying to figure it out, reading the manual, etc. It now sits quietly in my closet unused and waiting for the day that I have enough time, energy, and patience to tackle it again. I am sure that an eight year old could set it up in no time, but I'm, well, older than that. This clock has a zillion variations and you can set it to do almost anything. It appears to be sturdy and well built, but so far I have been unable to use it at all. Very disappointing. I am not stupid or technophobic, but for me this was too much. If I can stll return it, I probably will."
1,Not For Novices,"This is a product which has obvioulsy been designed and explained by engineers. I wanted a simple clock with which I could set a time, say 20 or 30 minutes, so my wife and I could play timed scrabble. The directions are confusing, and I cannot set it do do just a simple countdown. The time shown swaps between hours and minutes to minutes and seconds but only at an arbitrary point. I guess it's fine if you want time and move counts, but am unable to do what I want it do, just count down from 30 minutes while showing the seconds. The function buttons on the face are could be easily simplified and more intuitive. I find the whole thing very frustrating and disapointing."
3,I have no idea.,"Never recieved this due to P.O. error or one of my neighbors stole it, which I have never been able to prove. Glad I didn't spend alot on it. Seemed like a nice enough chess clock. I hope the person who stole it is enjoying it! Don't ever say I never gave you anything!"
1,I DIDN'T GET WHAT I ORDERED!!!!!,"I've been ordering things from amazon for a while now. So I figured why not order something again, a chess clock. I'm out on the road weeks at a time so it's hard waiting to get home to open products I order. I get home, open the package, lo and behold the wrong product. The Talking Bingo. I don't play bingo. This is a Saturday evening, so by the time I get in contact with somebody, I'll be gone back to work again monday. This screw up has never happened to me in the history of ordering from amazon or whoever the seller is."
2,"Worked flawlessly till bam, it did just stop for no apparent reason","The battery part seem to have dropped a piece that was crucial on it working, now it wont work, wont even turn on..There's no logical explanation on how the little piece dropped, im just thinking about it because my friend has the same clock and he has a little piece that my doesnt... not durable clock"
4,Good and expensive,"Bought this for my kid because his was dropped. It is a good one, needs a bit more info from the instruction though to make it work. It is a little too expensive, I expected more for $30.00."
5,Good for the price,"This is a nice solid clock. The price is good, too. You can edit the game time, moves, and delay. There are several preset modes. The clock can also store one setting. The button can be set to have a green light and the clock beeps if wanted.On the down side, the instructions are painful to read (and re-read.) Also, the delay time is only available in simple delay. No Fischer time. The C batteries needed a special trip to the store, since nothing else I own uses C batteries.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this used book which was supposed to be in ""good"" condition. It was anything but. I've ordered used textbooks off of Amazon for years but this was the worst quality by far. Numerous pages were scribbled in like a child took a black pen to them. At least one page is completely unreadable. This is in addition to highlighting. I emailed the sender and they were willing to refund, but since my class started I didn't have time to send it back and wait for another book from a different vendor to arrive. At first the sender offered a 10% discount if I kept it and emailed them pictures. I emailed all the pictures Amazon would let me attach. The sender never did give me the 10% discount. I'll never buy from this vendor again."
3,"Good overview, but not in depth","This book contains a good overview of many topics school social workers will encounter and provides an extensive list of resources at the end of each chapter. Well organized. However, there the authors don't go in depth on any of the topics or offer specific counseling techniques that most school counselors don't already know."
4,fun book for young adults,"This is a cute book that has obviously been designed for a young novice in the magical arts, sort of a Harry Potteresque instruction book. It's hard to tell whether this is a serious book on the subject at first, but it does have real magic and techniques for increasing concentration and such, and half of the book is taken up by a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" type of novella.The only annoying thing about it this book is that it mixes fantasy and real magical techniques, but I suppose that might be fun for a younger reader. It's a bit like telling children about Santa Claus, though.In short, this is a good book for a young adult who is interested in magic and fantasy (and most likely a Harry Potter fan) but doesn't know where to begin, and/or if you want to teach a young adult magical technique but want to do it in a fun way."
4,The Book of Wizardry,"This is a ""charming"" book with all sorts of things a budding young wizard apprentice should know. It contains lessons at the end of every chapter, and the chapters are short so it moves along. After completing all of the lessons, including things such as making a wizard's cup and magic wand, there is a game you can read and play. I would highly recommend this item for young and young at heart who are fans of that famous young wizard with the initials HP."
2,Just a few questions...,"I have read the book, and i completed it but i was very hazy at the end. In the end you become a ""fully-accredited wizard in the first-degree""...okay, is there a second-degree, a third-degree, or what? Secondly, when he talks about the creation of the Wizard's Tools, he speaks briefly about using them to control the elements in a ritual, which he never gets into. Thirdly, he never gets to the magic part, no spells, no ritual, no nothing. Is he planning on making a second book or what since this one was for apprentices? Very frustrating, and very confusing."
1,Not for Wizards-to-be!,"This book is not for the Wizard, it's not anything but a game! The whole book leads you to a game, and has nothing to do with real Wizardry! I don't like this book! It's a complete waste of your money!"
3,Ow,"Good information but not for the lay person. Very complex concepts and not written in an easy to digest manner. I am a very fast reader, however, this book took me several days to read. I had to stop and nurse a headache every few hours. I was left wanting as well. Exercises are presented in a manner which get lost in between the text. Almost need a translator for the translator to be put into more readable way. Still, you can tell their is a wealth of information here. It just needs to be dug up."
3,these pills are not very good,"i bought these pills as i read the reviews from people who have used them, you are meant to loose weight fast on average 4 1lb every few days. well i have been on these for over a week now and havnt lost a single bit of weight, they DO NOT suppress ya appetite like they say they do, if anything i feel more hungrey on them, i have no increase of energy and it clearly states you have much more whilst taking these pills. from my experience they are a waste of money!!!!"
5,Versatile strings for a great price.,"I use these strings on a jazz bass and have been happy with them for a few years. I find the sound of the jazz bass to be a bit bright at first, but I can play smoothly with these EB's. I use them on a passive bass and they seem to work well with some slap tones which is good.I use a variety of brands and strings on multiple basses and have come to like these with passive pickups. They are well priced and sound great in a variety of situations. I keep wanting to try out the cobalts by EB, but keep comming back to these because of the price and knowing they are tried and true.I bought these at a local shop where they suggest these strings to other players as their 'go to' strings for new players and most of us jazz bass players.I use DR High Beams in another active bass and did not think these strings sounded good with them, but that is probably just my opinion.I highly suggest these strings, I usually replace them every 3 months or so due to heavy playing."
2,Die very quickly.,"These strings die after about a week of use. In the week they sound half decent, but they are not worth the money. There are much better strings out there."
3,BROKEN STRING!,THE G STRING BROKE RIGHT OUT OF THE PACK....The strings are so god tho.....ill definitely buy them again...great price...the only strings i will use..great for slap bass
2,Didnt quite last very long...,"Purchased this last season, when we got our new camper. At first it was pretty nice... then after the first trip, it looked a bit worn... then it really just went bad from there. When we took it out of storage (stored in a climate controlled warehouse) the cover was ruined and we had to take it off... I should have purchased a hard cover for it I guess. Maybe someone else would have better luck than I did!"
3,Unconvincing big-band performances without charm,"Amazon is being a litle pedantic to call the Schubert 8th, the Unfinished, his Sym. #7. All four symphonies here are great ones, and Karajan runs through them with a big orchestra and a good deal of impact. But one misses any easiness, charm, or melancholy, all qualities that belong to the real Schubert. This is more Karajan's streamlined modern asesthetic than Schubert's, worthwhile mainly if you love the Berlin Phil's sleek, polished sound and want to hear every piece run through it.I should say that the competing sets from Abbado with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe (DG) and Colin Davis with the Dresden Staatskapelle (RCA) sound timid and dull respectively. I would hold out for the new Harnoncourt--his single performances have been excellent so far--or seek the many great performances that exist out there of each symphony."
2,I just didn't get it,"Other reviews have covered the story line so I won't do that again. I guess I just didn't get it. A lot of other reviews have indicated how much they like this movie and how touching and funny it is. I just did not find it very touching or funny. Like a lot of movies, it is not a terrible film, just not very engaging for me. Maybe it just appeals to certain viewers. I'm just adding my rating to balance the ratings total a little. I think a lot of viewers would not find this as interesting as many of the reviewers here do. Maybe we just don't get it, but that is OK - the world takes all kinds."
4,"Not Bad, could used some prototypes in it.","The book was great, just think that it would have been better if there had been some of the Prototype out-fits in it. I wanted the book to see the out-fits that Francie had. Now I want to see the prototypes, because some of the clothes where a nice style, but fabric was ugly. Maybe Joe Blitman will do another book with all of Francies things in it."
1,Careful - NOT a 19V equivalent!,"I ordered this 19V (""equivalent"" according to Amazon's product description) AC adapter for my Sony Vaio SZ, and received part # AC-B25 from Amazon. This adapter clearly states it is 15-17V, and it WILL NOT charge my 19V laptop!"
2,Evidence of Poor Design,"I was surprised to hear AC hum when listening to CDs and files while this was plugged in to my.TR 3A Evidently this power supply is not filtered properly unlike to original unit, so, to say that this is equivalent to the Sony PCGA-AC16V6 is very incorrect.While not affecting less critical applications, DO NOT use this power supply for applications involving video or audio where a clean power source is needed.Given evidence of poor quality that is evidently attributable to design, consider your application carefully before purchasing a power supply offered by ""HI Capacity Power Products"".While I am no fan of the quality of Sony's power supply because of an issue with intermittent connection in the supply side after moderate use, I see no reason to keep this unit and will probably scrap it just to get cleaner power."
5,Real Good,"The only gripe that I have with this book is that the author could and should have placed more detailed information in the text. Otherwise this book is strong medicine for those parents educators and concerned community activists and excellent documentation on the genius that is inherent in urban, rural and suburban children….One of the most important detail being….some children already have a head start, it is up to the community to make sure this advantage is continued…..I’ve already put some points to good use."
3,Great book if you have a baby,"I was looking for older age, like teens. it was good information. you have to convert what you learn to older children"
1,"Rebecca, Colorado",Do NOT buy this book if your child cannot read. There is no cue to turn the page. Why would a company make such a ridiculous item? Who do they think is buying these books? We buy them because our children can't read.
5,"Beautiful books, fun to listen to, perfect for quiet time/bedtime","I am a little shocked at the strong reactions of those who wanted a page-turning chime... though handy, it's absence certainly doesn't render the book/CD useless. That feature aside, these books are expertly narrated, clearly and enthusiastically in a pleasant voice (I'm always amazed at the narrator's ability to ""become"" each character). The books are large, sturdy and of excellent quality, with glossy pages and vibrant, beautiful illustrations. We read the stories together at bedtime with our three-year old, and then turn on the CD after she gets into bed, so with the images fresh in her mind, she can wind down and fall asleep listening to the tales she loves. They provide nearly an hour of playtime, with a little intro before each story. These books have allowed my stubborn daughter a comforting way to fall asleep on her own. It has worked out wonderfully for us. We love them and we will definitely be buying more in the series."
1,No 'Tone',"For a Read-Along book, they simply missed the point. There is no chime or tone to remind the child when to turn the page and therefore 'read along'. Also, the narrator has one tone and limited voice intonation -- she makes no effort to distinguish between characters. Cheaply edited, not worth the money. See ""Disney's Read Along Collection"" for a better quality product."
3,Great picture book for toddlers,"My three year old twins love this book. They like to just sit on the floor and look at the pictures. I like the fact that the pictures are so colorful and the book is big enough for both to look at the same time. At this age they are a little ""worried"" by the audio (Bambi is particularly intense with the gunshots and all) so we do not use the CD right now. The audio does NOT have a cue to turn the page so not such a great product for older children..."
1,not happy,orderd disney animals cd story book and the book came with no cd and when I contacted them they said sorry no more books in stock but thay still have them on there site.
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T DO IT!,"I purchased this 3-pack of anti splintering devices...for naught.In my opinion, invest in a finer toothed blade, and it will do the same thing...better and with less hassel.The cons:1) It snapped on easily enough (onto my plastic shoe cover), but it falls off waaaaaay to easily.2) It is supposed to be totally centered...but yet, somehow, it still got chewed-up by the blade. Now two of them look all nasty and ghetto - preventing me from seeing the cutting as it's taking place.3) It blockes the view of the actual cutting.Does it work? I'm not really sure.Why?Because after a few times that the darn thing fell off during a project, I just threw it away. I have fine blades, and the blades leave very fine cuts in themselves.Waste of money.But if you gotta try em to see for yourself...who am I to stop you? I can tell you over and over that Ford trucks have no power. But if you want one, you want one.Nuff said.In Christ: Raymond"
5,A fascinating book,This is a fascinating book about airship technology. It has lots of technical data and practical advice. It shows examples of contemporary airships and it even has a chapter on future developments of airship technology.
4,We Love Geotrax,"We absolutely love Geotrax. We had bought a Thomas train when my son was 2 1/2 and he barely used it. We bought Geotrax for him when he was 4, he is now 6 and still wants more Geotrax! The bayshore drawbridge is nice but I wish it had a little more life to it. Some of the new pieces have Geomotion and I wish this drawbridge had Geomotion as well. That would be really cool. Nonetheless, we love this piece and Geotrax. Must have for any boy ages 2+."
5,A wonderful book for living life in a natural way,"I ordered this wonderful book last year because I was interested in herbal medicine. Since that time, I have used this book countless times for common ailments like colds, flu, bug bites, scrapes, bruises, etc. In almost every case, the recommendations given by Ms. Levy work as well or better than expensive, over the counter medications & salves. Some of the herbal recommendations, including using fresh basil on insect bites have results which are almost miraculous. I highly recommend this book. It's very interesting reading as well, Ms. Bairacli Levy infuses it with her life experiences garnered by learned about herbal medicine from indigenous people around the world. I cannot say enough about this book...it is one of the best and most helpful books I've ever bought."
4,Great phone system despite complaints,"I have had two of these handsets and the base for almost 3 years (to replace my Siemens system). I have dropped them, keep them in the kitchen (phone and cook - great), have gotten them dirty, and one even has my dog's teeth marks on it.Yeah it does feel cheaply made but if it survived that long in my house then it has proved itself. The bluetooth is great and the only reason I gave it 4/5 is because it is cranky about paring with my and my husband's cell phones - but when he is gone it is the best extension of my cell no more sprinting up stairs when the phone rings.I have never had any call quality issues, just standard battery replacements, so the only down side is the cheapness of the feel and the display that looks like it was laid out for a moron instead of making it the features easy to find and stylish.Too bad they haven't updated it - and I paid no where near what others on this site are saying. About 200 all said and done three years ago...."
2,Short term product,"As others have posted this phone is not worth the cost. Too bad Uniden saw fit to put this product out. There must have been a huge profit margin in it for them. Will try another manufacturer's product and spend again for a home phone. The Bluetooth is the hook, the quality of manufacture is the pain. And your right, the cost of repair is far beyond commansensical."
3,OK item,"Worked ok, but always had static on the line. Finally replaced the phones with another manufacturer. The new one works better for us."
1,Frustrated,"While the transaction and refund process of this product were handled very well. I was frustrated that I had to return it because the reason I had to return it was that it came to me empty. Yes, I said empty. I installed it into my printer and my printer kept telling me to replace the toner. At first I thought that I had some how switch the old one and the new one when trying to replace it. Not the case, the ""new"" one was empty. This is not an easy product to find for less than $35 and now I have to reorder toner which means I am without my printer for that much longer as it's not available at any store near me."
4,Illustrated Library of World Poetry is beautiful inside and out.,"This beautifully crafted book is a wonderful edition to anyone's collection. Crafted as one would expect from a deluxe edition, with ridged spine, guilded page edges, and ribbon page marker attached. 775 pages of actual poetry with an index of first lines in the back and a table of contents, list of illustrations, and an index of authors in the front of the book. The only caution I would give to anyone wishing to purchase this book is that the Font (Type) used is quite small (approximately 6 points) which would make it very difficult for anyone with vision problems to enjoy. Otherwise, this volume is a great choice with a good variety of poems and themes to enjoy."
2,why is cheap so difficult?,"even with the manual, this thing is a nightmare to set up. you have to have 50 million cables going all over the place. I just had to unplug one thing from my dvd/vcr that I replaced with this--so I wasnt prepared. I have gotten it to record a dvd one time, and that was after I played around with it until something worked--of course, this was AFTER the movie I had wanted to record was over, so I didnt continue to record, so I dont even know what the quality wouldve been! I dont remember what I did, and I havent gotten it to work since. I guess I will have to pull out the 1000 lb TV one more time and make sure I have the cables where they need to be (there's about 5 sets back there!) and try one more time before I take a sledge hammer to it."
3,Where's Jiminy?,"I had this record back in the 50's, actually it was my older brothers record. At that time it was entitled ""A Day At Disneyland"" and it was a great record to listen to before visiting the park itself. This rerelease is good as far as bringing back those fond memories, except one problem, there is no Jiminy Cricket. The original recording had Jiminy narrating along with the music throughout the different lands and was a bit more entertaining. My brother recently obtained the original L.P. in a used record store, I am having him record it for me. This new one is good but I really miss the cricket, Jiminy made it great."
5,Walt's Voice....Walt's Dream,"I purchased this cd at Disneyland a couple of years ago, I just adore it. I loaded it into my iTunes library, and I enjoy listening to the vintage music and the Voice of Walt himself, taking me on a tour of our beloved Disneyland. It's got music I remember from my childhood, I was born two months before the Park opened in 1955, my first trip there was in the fall of '55...and I've been a frequent visitor ever since. I've seen the park grow and change in 56 years, this cd brings back some of the best. This is a quality product, and no Disneyland fan should be without it."
4,Walt Disney Takes You to Disneyland,This cd is pretty good. Walt takes you on journeys around the Magic Kingdom at Disneyland. He explains what is going on with music. Each track is about 5 to 10 minutes long.
5,An Insightful Work,"I am a corporate attorney in New York. I participate in a Sunday evening book club that focuses primarily on the classics -- e.g., Homer's ""The Iliad"" and Plutarch's ""Caesar"". From time to time, we read academic works. I have attempted, with no success, to get this highly astute, insightful, and scholastic work on our reading list. I have read ""The Word Rides Again"" twice and yearn for the opportunity to discuss it with others. The author is amazingly perceptive, his analysis is sharp, and his writing style is clear, concise, and comprehensible. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If there is anyone (the author? dare I dream?) who would like to engage in a discussion of ""The Word Rides Again,"" please feel free to send me an e-mail."
5,You Need to Give This CD a Chance. It's Great!,"My seven year old loves singing Patriotic songs and the Broadway Kids; so of course I purchased this when I first saw it. The songs weren't what I expected, and my daughter wasn't very taken with it ""at first."" But songs like ""I've Been Everywhere"" and ""Good Morning America"" are now her favorites, and she likes the familiarity of the other American standards. The CD is full of geography and the song about all the presidents sneaks some history in too. Can't go wrong with a CD kids like and they learn from too."
2,design,"I'm not sure that this is the original ""Paul Sebastian"" product. As I remember when I used to purchased it from well know stores the scent was much stronger. I feel that this product was an imitation of the original."
2,Nothing we haven't seen before,"This book makes no narrative sense. It mixes up her early years and her last years and throws pages about Diana ""in red"" and ""in pink"" in between. Tim Graham did take some great photos but this book isn't the great fashion book it's billed to be. I think Georgina Howell and Diane Clehane's book are much better because they tell the story of the princess' life in fashion and have even more breathtaking photos because they are not all taken by the same photographer. A disappointment"
4,A different DeMille that is still a worth while read,"As I understnd it, DeMille fought in the Vietnam conflict and this book is his way of relating his first experiences. I was in college during this conflict and while I was somewhat aware it it, I was not too keen on following it. I was deferred from military service having the luxury of teachin in a poverty grammar school in Pittsburgh while attending law school at night.Up Country was an excellent travel log of places in Vietnam that I was albe to google and see pictures of while I was reading. This book also gave me a better understanding of this conflict, well after the fact. I certainly was glad to have been able to skip this war. It was far better for more to read about this nasty war by a good writer than it was to be there in the fray with the dogs of war.This was a good book that held my interest, as do most DeMille books. I have read better books, but I can say sincerely that I have no regrets about Up Country."
4,Vietnam,"Still reading. Takes awhile to get into this book however, half-way through it starts getting more interesting. . Excellent writing about Vietnam, very visual account. If you are a DeMille fan you should enjoy this book; if you are reading DeMille for the first time, try an easier read such as Gate House.I'll review more upon completion of Up Country."
3,Great travelogue for Vietnam!,"UPCOUNTRY offers a fantastic picture of Vietnam today, with intriguing side glimpses of the war years. It's superbly done, and you finish the book with a much clearer understanding of just what happened in those dreadful years. However, the story line seems to get lost at times. There's actually not much to the book other than Paul and Susan running around the country. Susan at times seems an utter ditz. Not much background on what happened to the young lieutenant back during the war, how it happened and why it happened. At times you can completely forget about the murder under investigation and fall under the ""travelogue"" spell. Even now, having finished the book, I'm not completely clear on why the murder happened. The ending is hurried, incomplete and unbelievable. DeMille's first offering featuring Paul Brenner, THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER, was much more concise with a clear storyline. It didn't take the reader on a long travelogue around the American South."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I'm a huge fan of Demille, ordinarily, but this novel just dragged on so long, I finally quit caring about the characters or even the point of the story. If Demille needed to do some personal work on his experience during the Vietnam War, maybe a novel that actually *happened* during the War would have worked better."
2,travelog,"the story is slow and the novel reads like a travelog. I have really enjoyed his other novels and am alittle disapointed in this one. But, he is as good if not better then most current novelists."
4,A page turner!,I was so excited to read DeMille's latest and could not put it down. I enjoyed the character of Paul Brenner more the second time around- Brenner has adopted much of John Corey's (Plum Island/Lion's Game) sarcasm and wry humor.Much of this novel is a description of travel through Vietnam. I do not see why this should be a complaint. It is also plot/character development. DeMille's personal experiences as a returning veteren shine through. America's actions in Vietnma are important to current events today and Up COuntry really offers greater understanding. This book brought the experiences of that place and era to light more than any other source I have come across.The suspense plot does not falter and is expertly written. Although Lion's Game remain's DeMille's best thriller Up Country is one of the best books I have read in some time!
5,Move Over Ernest Hemingway,"Nelson DeMille improves noticably with each new book, always experimenting, a striking feat considering that he is the greatest American writer. There is nothing more satisfying to read than a first-rate character, such as Paul Brenner, who appears in a series of gripping, fast-moving novels. I would suggest to any voracious reader who wants to add some excitement to their lives that they buy the entire series, start from the beginning, and then start over once done. I see plenty of good reviews of Up Country here, with good descriptions. As for the less positive reviews, I don't know what book they read!"
3,"Good, but boring.","This book is 700 pages long. The first hundred pages and the last two hundred pages are the only interesting sections. Everything else is pretty boring, unless you are a Vietnam vet and can relate to DeMille's story. I loved the General's Daughter, but this is no General's Daughter. Also, the conclusion left some loose ends."
3,Definitely not Demille's Finest Work,"Just finished Up Country. While I did manage to finish the book, it could have been about 200 pages shorter and no one would have known the difference. I kept wondering what was going on with the plot while Brenner relived his nightmarish experiences from Vietnam. I read it, and I'm happy that I did, but in retrospect, save your money or buy Charm School instead."
2,Where is the ending?,"Okay, I can deal with the length because I like drawn out stories and skipped over a lot of the repetitive trips down memory lane. What kept me going was my anticipation for a dramatic ending, but I'm still waiting... I couldn't believe that 800+ pages of my life was wasted on a conclusion so dull."
2,A self indulgent road-trip under the cloak of a mystery.,"600 pages into this book and you are still no closer to the supposed purpose of the journey. If DeMille wanted to write a travel book about his return to his war haunts why not present it as a travel book. The jouney while somewhat interesting is also repetitive and long. And, can we have some variety in character. No matter what the names, they are always the smarmy middle aged, self important and self defacing, though pretending not to be hero, and the semi-dum mid-thirties brunette, fawning over our hero. Does DeMille have confidence problems with women?"
3,Long-winded DeMille,"Usually a huge fan of Demille's, I slogged through this missive on the beaches of Mexico.It seems that Demille wrote this novel more for himself than for us. The book starts off in the usual Demille style, but drags for the middle 400 pages. If I want to travel to Vietnam and need a guide book, I'll buy a Frodor. The last 200 pages redeem the story, but not enough to justify the rambling. If you buy this book, skip pages 100-500 and you will not only spare yourself some drudgery, you will also create a tighter, more interesting page turner!"
1,Slow and Boring,"I usually give a book 100 pages to ""hook me"". I gave ""Up Country"" 400 pages before I lay it down never to be picked up again. I recognize that people that have been in Vietnam could identify themselves with the story and place, but still it was too slow and boring. Somewhat painful to read.Try ""The Charm Scholl"" from the same author, a truly 5 star book."
2,"Boring, boring...","After reading DeMille's ""Plum Island,"" I was ready for another great read. But this title settles into a boring series of descriptions of battlefields and geographies while giving the main story line little attention. This author needs to learn how to use words conservatively to tell a compelling story."
1,Demille Fan Let Down,"Having read all of Demille's prior work, I anticipated this book to be in the same style as the rest of his work. There is just not enough action in this book.The first 400 pages are wasted on boring scenery and history lessons for background purposes. The story just never picks up. The plot is very weak and then the story ends very abruptly. Read Lion's Game instead, great book."
2,Almost as long as the Vietnam War itself,"I enjoyed this book for the trip through Vietnam and the references to things I had forgotten. But, ye gods, did he have to go on and on and on?? Everything was unnecessarily dragged out. I think he coulda told the story in 500 pages and made it equally compelling. De Mille's a good writer -- I think he just indulged himself here and his publisher -- rewarding him for his past successes -- allowed him to do so."
4,Just Great,I don't really know . I ordered this book Nov. 29 2007 was shipped the wrong book .Returned book It is now Jan. 7 2008 and just got package . It has the same wrong book as was shipped the first time . Doesn't say much for amazons warehouse help . Guess I'll start buying some where else .Chris
1,For Tourists,"DeMille's latest reads like a tour guide of Viet Nam.Definitely not a page turner, I had difficulty justpicking the book up every night. Much too much dialouge.The only way I could finish this novel, was to speed-read through it."
3,"Good, but probably best appreciated by Vietnam Vets","I DID enjoy this book, but I would have to say it was not one of my favorite DeMille novels. Taken solely as a novel, I didn't enjoy it as much as some of DeMille's other works... The plot was less believable and maybe not quite as gripping, although still suspenseful.That being said, I'm really glad I read this book, if for no other reason than to better understand my father's time in Vietnam. My father read it first, and remembered the places and battles (Hwy 1, A-Shau Valley) described by the main character. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys action/military fiction, but think the folks that served over there would probably appreciate it the most."
4,GREAT SEQUEL,"A great sequel to THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER mainly because it doesn't try to be the same thing all over again. Paul Brenner is back but retired from Army CID. He reluctantly takes a case as a civilian that returns him to Vietnam and some unpleasant memories. When he's not banging Susan Weber, a CIA ""business woman"" from Saigon, assigned to assist him, he's smart-mouthing the commie police and assorted authority figures. This is a humorous and reflective novel about Vietnam and provides an interesting overview of the way things were during the war and its current effect on the Vietnamese people. Different and well worth the read. I look forward to Mr. DeMille's next effort. What a great author."
2,It's a travelogue,"I have been a fan of Nelson DeMille since I read his first book, ""Word of Honor."" That book ranks with my favorite contemporary novels. So it was with great relish that I invested in ""Up Country"" -- a return to Viet Nam, and a sort of sequel to ""The General's Daughter"" in that Army investigator Paul Brenner comes back as narrator and hero.What a let down I was in for. For chapter after chapter I waited for something to happen to advance the plot. Instead I got a travelogue of current Viet Nam as seen through the eyes of a veteran of that conflict. I plodded on, still hoping for something of interest to happen, but it was a struggle for me to finish this one. When I did I was sorely disappointed, for there was virtually no denouement.DeMille is a very capable writer who can write compelling books in a variety of settings. ""Up Country"" is not such a book, to my regret."
2,Disappointment,"I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books. Most I liked, with the exception of By the Rivers of Babylon. I enjoyed The General's Daughter. The subject book was a great disappointment. I agree with Maggie101 and Moscow, who wrote reviews about this book. Had I read their comments first, I would probably not have purchased the book. This was, for the most part, a travelog, without the slides, of Viet Nam. The plot was poor and I agree that the ending was quite unsatisfactory. I won't quit reading Demille, of course, but next time I'll probably wait for paperback or a used book."
2,Not Demille's Best,"I love Demille's books, but this just wasn't one of his best. Wouldn't recommend to anyone but Viet Nam Vets or children of same."
2,"Boring and unrealalistic characters, disappointed ending","My title says it all. Ken Howard was ok but he had nothing to work with. Come on, a smoking woman and a guy that doesn't getting together? ugh, the breath of it all, too bad the story didn't have ANY breath."
1,300 pages too ling,"Demille's Gold Coast is one of my all-time favorite books, but Up Country seems to have been written by a mediocre author intent on cranking out 800+ pages in one draft. The writing is repetitive, shallow, annoyingly chatty, and several of the events described strain the credibility of the reader."
1,Too many details---,At first I thought this would be a very good read---even took along on vacation! The beginning was there but the story was a drag too many details the story line got lost and never came back.
5,Up Country,"This is absolutely not Mr. DeMilles most entertaining novel.However it may well be his most heart felt. The action seems a little slow at first and I was able to make an educated guess as to the outcome very early on in the story. I have given this novel a five star rating because there is a sense of reality only a real Viet Nam veteran could bring to this book. The action is intense and I could almost feel the real pain and conflict of those who served in this confused situation. I respect Mr. DeMille as a great author, but my deepest respect is for his service to this country during an unpopular conflict. Read this book and you will be a better informed american.John Oliver"
2,DeMille is excellent - but not this time,"Nelson Demille is, by far, my favourite author and a writer of substantial quality. All of his books are of the highest quality and a pleasure to read and re-read. Up Country is however, the only exception. Being many many pages in length it is certainly an interesting insight into the '68 Tet Offensive however it is lacking any worthy plot. The novel unfortunately reads as more of a set of war memoirs although I am pleased that Nelson has 'got this off his chest'! I even flew to the Vero Beach book centre to meet Nelson and for him to sign my copy so it's a shame I'm unlikely to read this novel again. An interesting read, but not a classic."
1,"Way too long, way too boring","Okay, I'm on page 412 and still waiting for this story to get off the ground. The extended travelogue that passes for a plot has become tedious as have the hero's reminiscences of his exploits during the Vietnam War.As our hero sloooowly makes his way from South to North Vietnam, the most exciting thing that's happened so far is a not very exciting car chase. Oh, and he is traveling with an American ex-pat who so far serves no other purpose than somebody for him to impress with his war stories and somebody for him to have sex with."
1,oh my,"this is a horrible, interminable, tedious journey through a caricature of Vietnam. Plus it's totally offensive for its characterization of the ""slant eyes"" (I wish that were my term, and not his from the book). For summer reading, over this I recommend the back of a suntan lotion bottle. Please stop writing such bloated nonsense."
1,"Long, Tedious, Unbelievable and Boring",This book is over 800 pages of turgid prose and a boring yet unbelievable plot. Absolutely one of the worst books I have ever read. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
5,DeMille Does It Again,"Fans of DeMille will be delighted with Up Country. While it may be his longest work yet, it is one which the reader will not want to end. Those readers who served in the military, particularly the Army, during the Vietnam war will find that bond forged by a common hardship and suffering carries over into DeMille's work--once an infantryman, always an infantryman. DeMille, as usual, develops his characters in sharp and complicated detail. With every twist and turn of the plot, another layer of complexity is added to the two main characters, Paul Brenner and Susan Weber. And as usual, DeMille's dialogue is dead on always, and hilarious at times. I had to leave the bedroom while I read Up Country. I kept laughing out loud at Brenner's wiseass dialogue and waking my wife. Do yourself a favor and buy this book. It's the best read you will have until the next DeMille novel is published. I haven't enjoyed myself as much since I read The Gold Coast."
5,Didn't Disappoint,"I never get tired of his wisecracking couples. I was laughing one minute and scared to death for them the next. Also, though I was young at the time of the Vietnam war, I've lived all these years in the aftermath of it and found this book so insightful and helpful to an understanding of the madness."
3,Certainly not the best from Nelson....,"I am a fan of Nelson Demille. His writing is crisp, funny and absorbing. Up Country was disappointing. A few brief snippets of excitement and humor (any interaction between Brenner and Mang) otherwise it was mearly a travelogue of Vietnam.The travelogue was interesting, I'll give it that, but the book is pondering and slow.My biggest peeve of this book.............every chapter, or every few pages (it seemed) had the line ""I didn't reply"" from Paul Brenner. It drove me nuts! For God's sake Paul.....REPLY!!! This overworked line was extremely bothersome, even if Nelson meant it as part of Brenner's character. Whatever.Anyway, after Lions Game, Gold Coast, Plum Island, Cathedral, By the Rivers of Babylon, Charm School, General's Daughter etc...Up Country has been my least favorite. But I'll cut Nelson some slack on this one............maybe!"
4,Up Country,I am enjoying the book - very interesting reading about Veitnam post war in the mid-90's - as I lived through the 10 year war.
2,Not what I expect from Demille,"The book is one third travelogue, one third a collection of Vietnam war stories and the balance is mostly piffle. There is a weak plot with an outcome that I mostly figured out pretty quickly. I am a DeMille fan and have read many of his books, but was not wild about this one. At almost nine hundred pages, you probably will want to be really, really interested in Vietnam history, culture and the names of eighty zillion little towns in the middle of nowhere, and all the road names to get you to them. My general impression is that the book is an excuse for the author to to do an autobiographic walk down memory lane at the reader's expense."
2,Ho Hum Travelogue through Viet Nam,"Although it is billed as a thriller, this book mainly focuses on flashbacks to Vietnam, during the war. The plot is thin, and the ending is unfulfilling."
4,"""A Return Visit To Vietnam In 1997""",In 1997 Paul Brenner and Susan Weber were assigned to solve the murder of a US Lt. by a US Capt. during the Tet offensive of 1968. However this was clearly secondary and only the thread that you followed in DeMille's true purpose for writing this novel; to show the reader Vietnam. The author brillantly described his return to the battle fields of 1968 Viet Nam with great insight and perspectives of one of the darkest times in world history for the countries involved.
4,Up Country is two thumbs up,This is an interesting look at the Vietnam war forty years later. Intriguing and manipulative woman showing up on his secret operation to take place throughout the Vietnamese countryside changes the outlook and outcome. Seemingly innocent beginnings twist to a new and dangerous story. Keeps you glued to see what is exposed next.
2,Big DeMille Fan - BUT - Bigger Disappointment,"I've read them all and really like Nelson's writing style. I especially like the sharp witted reply's his main characters always display. I'd still recommend that any DeMille fan read this book, but it isn't his best work. Seemed very rushed to finish it and the ending is unsat. Great detail on Viet Nam. If I had to request one thing of Nelson, it would be to ""have someone who cares about your plots read the book and take the time to listen and make the appropriate changes""."
1,An ex- Demille fan,"I am a very big Nelson Demille fan and have read everything hehas written. When I received this book in the mail, I was veryexcited about reading it. Unfortunately, I had great difficultybecoming absorbed in the plot and caring about the characters.I slowly muddled through the too-long book and thought many timesabout not finishing it. In fact, I read several Dennis Lehanebooks while in the middle of this travelogue. I guess this was a cathartic experience for Demille, but not one that wasworth the price of a hardcover copy for me. I was very disappointed and will think twice about spending money on his next book. If I wanted a travel guide for Viet Nam, I would havebought one."
4,LONG AND HISTORICAL,"The story honors the men who fought in Viet Nam and then came home to a putrid welcome. These men honored the country of their birth by accepting the call (draft) to fight in this, at the first, 'popular' war. This book clearly depicts much of the horror they suffered. It tells the story of a real boy to man.The HC edition was in good condition with its DJ."
2,"Personal catharsis, not a great novel","The prior reviewer nailed it on the head; This book was obviously a major catharsis for DeMille, and a major disappointment for the reader. If it weren't for the fact that I'm a devoted fan of his, and his great wit, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish the book. Instead of a great storyline you are presented with page after page of painstaking detail about the surrounding countryside. This novel pales in comparison to his better ones like The Charm School, Plum Island, or The Lion's Game."
5,The Long Goodbye,"I'm a huge fan of DeMille's, and this book is right up there with ""Word of Honor"", ""Gold Coast"" and ""Plum Island"". It's interesting, relevant, harrowing and funny as hell. After two tours, Paul Brenner is finally saying goodbye to his personal nightmare called Vietnam. There is a murder to be solved, but the real story is Paul's journey through space and time. As Paul travels from Saigon, through Hue, Diem Bien Phu and ultimately Hanoi with a beautiful and reckless girl at his side, you can hardly wait to see what new adventure DeMille has planned for them each step of the way. The book is long, but what is long when the journey is so much fun?"
2,People finished this book???,"Sorry, I'm a BIG DeMille fan. However, I have triedreading this book at least 3 times...I've read at least5 novels in the meantime. I guess I will one day get beyondthe Viet Nam travelogue. Maybe not. This is way tootiresome for me. I'd rather re-read my old letters froman old boyfriend who fought in Viet Nam. Sorry, Nelson.You used to be TOPS with me."
3,Weakest Demille Yet,"I have read all of Demille's books and eagerly await new arrivals. This one, however, did not live up to his past work. While I did read the 700+ pages, the gripping action was not there.If you are a Demille fan, you will read this book...just don't get your hopes up too high."
3,Another Disappointment,"DeMille was my favorite beachside-vacation author. Until Lion's Game and now Up Country. My chief complaint is that neither book really ends - with the main narrative threads left hanging in mid-air - and I am left wondering in both cases whether some pages got accidentally torn out, or perhaps, the editors decided to guillotine the books without concern for plotline."
4,outstanding read!,"Not quite as good as G Coast or Genral's Daughter, Bu DeMille is still the best thriller writer out there today."
2,"After 702 pages, where's the ending","DeMille is one of my favorite authors. I actually buy the book rather than go to the library. While it was at times tedious going, I was anxious to see how it would end. What a let down that there was no ending after 702 pages. While it certainly does seemed poised for a sequel, unfortunately, I won't remember all the details when and if the sequel comes out.The writing about Vietnam was very interesting. It made me want to visit."
4,Vietnam Revisited,"Up Country was very revealing as well as compelling. It provides insight into the Vietnam experience then and now. With frustration and chutzpah, Paul Brenner journeys across his former battlefields, taking the reader through all the emotions Brenner had not resolved. And there is a case to be solved. The case, which is interesting and keeps you guessing, seems almost secondary to the journey. I liked it and I am looking forward to reading more by DeMille."
2,Up Country,I was extremely disappointed in the book. I felt like I needed to pull something out the pages to get the book moving. The story sounds very interesting but never seems to get you where you want to go. I have read almost all of DeMille's book and this definitly falls to the bottom.
5,Vintage Demille Breathtaking -View of the Viet Nam war,"Mr Demille hasa wonderful talent for producing main characters that are irreverent and iconoclasts. I was most taken though by the journey into the Viet Nam war from a soldiers point of view. I know he researchs his books well so I was very saddened to read how repressive the government still is there. The author, as usual, really fleshes out the characters to the point where you feel you know them, or would like to. His power to tell a story is gripping."
3,Great setting -- bad plot,"I've been a fan of Demille since The Gold Coast, impressed with the dry humor and the clear view into a different culture. In this respect Up Country delivered, plausibly portraying the range of life and attitudes of the modern day Vietnamese people. The flashbacks to the war were similarly packed with imagery and well worth the read. Where the book falls pathetically short is in the overall plot that fails to provide sufficient motivation to be in Vietnam in the first place and, even more unreasonable, to start shooting people. Still I'm glad I read it."
2,Disappointing,"I waiting a long time for the newest Demille book. I'm soooooo disappointed! I have read all of his novels and find them absolutely impossible to put down. This one I find impossible to pick up. I'm forcing myself to try and finish it, but since I'm only half-way through and bored to tears, it will be a struggle!"
1,TOUR GUIDE,"I found this offering the worst that Mr. DeMille has had published. Ninety five percent a tour of Viet nam of today as compared to the war torn Viet Nam of yesteryear and five percent fictional plot.The ""Bruce Willis"" kind of dialogue with a female character was interesting but boring after awhile. I expected entertainment fiction not a personal take on the Nam war years which, by the way, was complete and pure fiction in itself. Please, Mr. DeMille, get back on track. Your fans deserve better."
1,I should have read the Amazon Customer Reviews,"Mr. DeMille generally writes a pretty good book. However, this one is a clunker, at least for the first 500 pages which is a boring (and a not too accurate) travel log of Viet Nam with a sterotype romance the last 100 pages. To net out, the meat of the first 500 pages is contained in the fly leaf of the book cover. The pace does pick up in the last 200 pages. This book is no advertisement for either Doubleday or Book of the Month Club that apparently selected this book sight unseen. My first mistake was not reading the Amazon Customer Reviews that in many cases warned the book was needlessly wordy. My second mistake was continuing to read the book after the first boring fifty pages under the mistaken belief that a fine author such as Mr. Demille would not produce such a disappointing book."
1,Not as advertised,"This book was supposed to be a thirty year old mystery that Paul Brenner is sent to Vietnam to solve. What it turned out to be was a long, confusing travelogue through Vietnam. The actual solving of the mystery was very late in the book and very anticlimactic. The book was about 300 pages too long and not worth the effort. I have read and enjoyed all of Nelson DeMille's other books and hope that this one was just an exception to his usually excellent storytelling."
4,"History, Fiction and DeMille","A scary true to life account of what happened in the jungles of Vietnam. My only complaint is that this book reads like a trip through time rather than a murder investigation. True to DeMille form however, I have an interest in reading more about the conflict since reading Up Country. Paul Brenner's role is more of a John Corey (Plum Island, Lion's Game), which made the trip through time not only interesting but also humorous as only DeMille can do. Up Country reads very well and quick, taking your time through the history of Vietnam and the detailed illustrations of the hell and the carnage will give you a great appreciation for what went through the millions that were fighting there. The ending is un-expected and startling, but does leave some questions hanging. I am a huge fan of DeMille and was not dissapointed, it is long, it is informative, it is humorous, it is saucy and it is worth your time."
4,Up Country,"As a surgeon in the USAF from '67 -'69 I had the honor to treat many of the young men wounded in that conflict. This book faithfully recalls the times and the emotions of those involved in the disaster of that era. An easy way to gain an insight into the history and geography of Vietnam, and enjoy a mystery as well."
3,More Of A Travelogue Than A Mystery,"Paul Brenner (from The General's Daughter) is asked to come out of his six months of retirement from the army to investigate a murder than may have occurred 30 years ago during the Vietnam War. This is an easy book to get into. DeMille's writing style is smooth and witty. But when Brenner arrives in Vietnam, the mystery is put on the back burner and the story becomes a travelogue of 1997 Vietnam. For those with an interest in Vietnam, this book is an excellent read. I, however, have little interest in that country so the 800 plus pages were a struggle to finish. Paul Brenner is a very likable character, but I never did warm to the character of Susan Weber. I did learn a lot, but I felt I was mislead in my expectations of a mystery."
2,Inferior sequel,"Nelson DeMille is hit-or-miss from my perspective; his John Corey novels deliver, but he occasionally writes a mediocre book (Up Country and Spencerville). This sequel to ""The General's Daughter"" is okay, but it's mostly dialogue concerning Paul Brenner's tours of Vietnam. He is sent on a recon mission to find an eyewitness to a possible murder committed by a U.S. Army officer. He meets Susan Weber, an expat living in Vietnam, and she proves to be alternately likable and shrewish. The book is interesting if you want to know more about the Vietnam conflict or history, otherwise, skip it and read his John Corey novels. They have far more action and slightly more intrigue."
2,On the Road... to Dien Bien Phu,I've read all 6 major DeMille books with Paul Brenner/John Corey. This one was NOT a page-turner. I felt like it was more a romance novel -- for guys. The motorcycling around Vietnam with a hot chick thing occupies 700 pages. The last 100 has the actual mystery and resolution. And it's not that compelling.
5,Great Vietnam Insight,"As someone who is too young to know much about Vietnam from personal experience, this book provided me a great historical escape into Vietnam and the effect it had on the men who were there. It is a little slow in places, but it still provides a great story and great historic context. It also explains a great deal about what it is currently like in Vietnam. This is not a high octane action book, but it is very powerful and creates a great setting."
3,It was Okay,"I am a Nelson DeMille fan, but this book took me forever to get through. Unless you are really interested in the ""Vietnam conflict"", it might take u a while to get through. I did not enjoy this book as much as his others."
3,Up Country,Too long and slow. I think it would be enjoyed by a Veteran of Vietnam more than someone that had not had a personal connection with that area.
4,695 Great Pages,"As I stated in the title above the first 695 pages were enthralling however, the ending was a disappointment. Demille did an excellent job describing the scenery of Vietnam today and Vietnam in 68 and 72. I enjoyed the dialogue between Mang and Brenner, however, I was truly disappointed with the ending. Demille gets his reading audience ready for a climatic ending and instead delivers an open ended finish that leaves the reader with more questions then answers.A better finshed would have earned a 5th star...."
5,UP COUNTRY,"U nlike Demille's previous books, this one's not so much a thrillerP aul Brenner returns to Vietnam where he must identify a killer.C hances of success seem slim, his contact's in SaigonO nly hope, it seems to him, is to move his focus on.U p he heads, travelling north, remembering details of the war,N ever out of danger, he's being followed by the law.T o Dien Bien Phu and further, he needs to end this case,R eally, it's the journey that's intriguing and the plot takes second place.Y es, this is truly an epic story told by a talented author."
2,Not the Demille I expected,"I was hoping for another General's Daughter type mystery. I thought for a little while there, that it could be, but I was disappointed. I have read all of Nelson DeMille's books and I do think that he is a great writer, however, I was looking forward to the mystery part, which really did not satisfy me.This is a great book if you are interested in taking a detailed tour of an American Veteran's Vietnam and are a war buff."
4,"great characters, little mystery","I like many enjoy reading Nelson DeMille. His characters, especially the witty and arrogant protagonist make me laugh often out loud. His females are sexy and attractive (except the smoking). The narrative (and travelogue) was great. I found the descriptions of current day Viet Nam interesting and the descriptions of the scenes from the war extremely intense and riveting. The bad guys were good (oxymoron?) but there wasn't enough confrontation. And when will Paul learn to be quiet (although that is what makes him fun to read)?My only complaint about the book is the mystery and the many questions left unanswered. First, why would the government send their best (although maverick) investigator to find an answer to something they already knew and something they wanted to keep a secret? Also, what happened at the end? An epilog would have been nice.All in all, a fun and informative read. Highly recommended!"
4,"Loved the Book, Hated the End","I've read most of Demille's books. I enjoyed this one very much. I was left wanting more at the end. As the main character ended his journey, Demille ended his story. It was almost as if, when he finished describing the war and the country he ran out of ideas. I thought it would have been more satisfying if he had completed the story of the characters' relationship. He left me wanting more....a sequel maybe???"
2,Disappointed,"I am greatly disappointed. I have read and thoroughly enjoyed everything DeMille has written and wait with impatience for each new work. This thing is nothing more that a travel report of yet another Viet Nam vet who feels compelled to return to the battlefield to resolve some issues that have burned deeply into his soul. I am like DeMille and thousands of others who earned infantry commissions right out of college, led rifle platoons and maybe commanded frontline companies and fought in I Corps near Hue, Phu Bai, Khe Sahn and Quang Tri. I read to relax. I didn't want to be reminded of every nook and cranny along QL 1 and QL 9. To the vets who need this stuff, Up Country will do it. I intend to be 1st in line when DeMilles next book comes out, but I genuinely wish I didn't read this one."
1,DeMille wrote this?,"I'm sorely disappointed with this book. I was looking forward to this book but halfway through, I ended up just skimming the pages. I mean, the book jacket said that it is a DeMille thriller and all his fans would know what to expect. What I didn't expect was a long, winding and never seem to end travelogue on Vietnam (even the leading lady character is not interesting.. give me Ms Sunhill back!!). Maybe DeMille's publisher should market this book as a Vietnam war book so that readers will not be misled.That said, I'm looking forward to reading the next DeMille's thriller.. a real thriller."
3,A somewhat painful read,"This book came highly touted and I enjoyed ""Generals Daughter"" so what the heck.The story goes on for just over 700 pages, the first 550 make it tough to keep going. The story ends very strong and almost makes up for the painfully slow majority of the tale."
2,Man's Midlife Fantasy,"I liked the character of Paul Brenner in The General's Daughter but in this book, he was clearly an aging man's picture of what he would LIKE to be. Paul Brenner is something like 53 years old but in tip top fighting shape, is able to attract a ""beautiful"" (did he tell us often enough??) intelligent 30ish woman (along with keeping another honey waiting at home for him), and manages to quip and grouse his way through interminable miles ""Up Country"". Give me a break!! No PERSON would want to be with this character, let alone highly desirable women!!!This overly long pointless contrived story represents Nelson DeMille's fantasy of what he could be - NOT any kind of character that is realistic.I would skip this book."
2,A violation of trust,"I have read every one of DeMille's books, and had looked forward to this one. I just finished ""Up Country"" after 3 days of concentrated reading - not doing anything else.Sure, it held my interest, but the travelogue of Vietnam battlefields did indeed become tedious, and when I finally reached the long-awaited conclusion, I was VERY disappointed and let-down. What a violation of the reader's trust that the author didn't wind things up!We never found out what happened to Paul, or if he even lived to get home. And what about Susan vs. Cynthia? Are we supposed to guess? Supply our own conclusion? Did I miss something?Hope this helped the author come to grips with his own demons...it sure wasn't worthy of three days of my time."
2,Way too long..didn't love it,"I'm sitting here reading some great reviews of Up Country and I'm thinking were we reading the same book? I've read all of DeMille's books and loved them. I did not love this one. The first 350 pages are a sightseer's tour of Vietnam with (of course) a new love interest. Paul Brenner does very well with the ladies. The story is not riveting - Nelson please let your editor DO SOME WORK. The back flap says Mr. DeMille went to Vietnam recently and was moved by the trip. The book reads like a travelogue with a hashed-over plot he kept in a file titled ""writers block-use when desperate""."
2,Quagmire,"In contrast to the author's previous page-turners, I had to force myself to wade though Up Country. As other reviewers have noted it's part travelogue, part war memoir, sandwiched around a pitifully thin (and predictable) plot with a wholly unsatisfying ending. I'm assuming the author deliberately adopted the ambiguous ending and tedious pace as a reflection of the American experience in Vietnam. If so, this book makes its point, but is a miserable read as a consequence.If you're looking for a well-done war memoir/travelogue, pick up Manchester's Goodbye Darkness. Up Country isn't worth 50 cents at a garage sale."
5,I could smell the fear,"As a veteran of the same time frame (66-68) that Mr. Demille spent in country, I can attest to his veracity. This is his finest work to date, and only whets my appetite for more. It is rare to find a page-turner that is also a great literary piece. This is it. The juxtaposition of todays Vietnam with yesterdays is heart wrenching for this reader who was there, and coupling this with a great mystery story is almost too much to bear. Another great work by this author, and I can only hope to see more of Paul Brenner."
3,More Travelogue/Vietnam-War-Memories Than Novel,"The author wrote a novel fashioned around his trip back to Vietnam to see places where he and his buddies had fought. This book is touted as a sequel to his ""The General's Daughter"" (that became a John Travolta movie) but only the only evidence of that is using the same name of the hero. Not much action here; mostly recollections of old battles and how the old battlefields look 30 years after the war. DeMille writes very well but has a habit of not finishing his novels. In this one, the reader wants to know - So what happened to the hero? - to the girl? - to the Vice President? Etc. He did this in his ""The Lion's Game"" also and even more shamefully. This is cheating the reader. In real like we take these hits, but as readers we trust the writer to give us the full story and the neat endings we are denied in life."
5,DeMille at his best,"I am a big DeMille fan and this was one of my favoites. I found the description of Vietnam today very interesting . The story line was full of suspense and his character development is just great. I always feel like the characters can jump off the page . That they are real , with human frailities and strengths just like all of us . I am planing a trip to Vietnam in the future with my veteran boyfriend and I sent this to him to read. He also thoroughly enjoyed it. I really think that anyone looking for a fast paced and informative read would like this novel."
4,"Really fun read. Casting directors, hear this:","""Up Country"" is the perfect vehicle for that long-awaitedmovie duo, Harrison Ford and Calista Flockhart. These two would be perfect for the roles of Paul and Susan. Also, Ford and Naomi Watts, for Susan is a true chameleon, and Watts's performance in ""Mullholland Drive"" qualifies her for the role of the debutante-CIA sidekick for the older Paul Brenner.Thanks to the author for giving us a fascinating, informative bird's-eye view of Vietnam during the war and Vietnam now. This novel has so many facets: it's a whodunnit, a thriller, a romance, a historical overview and a travelogue.While Brenner's sarcasm becomes a bit tiresome at times, it fits the world-weary,Vietnam pothead era-persona of the main character. Man, it's just gotta be Harrison Ford...not Travolta, not Bruce Willis, please....just Ford. I'd be the first in line for tickets."
3,Anyone know a good editor,"Having read all of Demilles books, I was disappointed with this one. I think he could have lost about 150 pages and that would have tightened up the book. I ended up skimming through the middle section."
3,DeMille getting soft and sloppy?,"I couldn't help thinking that the author was writing off a trip to Vietnam. I think DeMille is the best of the popular storytellers and some of his books--The Gold Coast and especially The Charm School--were riveting, but it seems that he's been phoning it in lately. This book is quite readable but the journey from premise to payoff is essentially a rambling travelogue, a predictable story with a highly unlikely girlfriend (surprisingly unreconciled with another romance back in the USA)and an ending that left me wondering if he ran out of paper. He still writes a lively, colorful chapter but he needs to get back to the quality of his earlier books. Also, some of his prose has a sloppy, first-draft sound."
1,Don't Bother!!,From page 3 to page 702 this is unrepentent drivel with no redeeming virtues. It rivals Wally Lamb's I Know This Much is True as the worst book ever written.
4,Great Read That's Also Educational,"""Up Country"" is my second Nelson Demille experience, following up the likeable, ""The General's Daughter"". From the outset, it is very clear that Paul Brenner is taking the same pilgrimmage that the author encountered in 1997 as a Vietnam veteran.Brenner has a mystery dangled in front of him, drawing the reader in, but, alas, the mystery really only figures in the last 150 pages of the 700 page novel.Instead, the book is largely about coming to terms with the Vietnam experience, 30 years later. While very educational, the book also addresses issues such as present day U.S.-Vietnam relations, the irony of dialogue with former enemies, and the need to come to terms with the past.I would strongly encourage Vietnam veterans to experience this book. It is a wonderful novel."
3,wheres the ending?,"I was sorely disappointed with the ending of this book. It is the most ""left hanging"" one that I have ever read."
2,Interminable,"This book goes on forever! Why, Oh why must the author describe ever article of clothing, color, fabric, etc. Why do we have to hear every cigarette lighted? There's a good story in there somewhere, I think it needs to be boiled down by about 15 tapes."
4,Good but not great,"This book was very readable and kept my interest. What attracted me most was the very vivid descriptions and the incredibly entertaining dialog. I couldn't help but smile and laugh with some of the dialog between the characters. I think Demille has a sense of humor and can't resist. Demille is a very good writer at keeping your interest. However, I found the ending slightly unsatisfying because it left too many issues unanswered. All in all, however, this is a fine book to take with you on vacation and it was a good read."
4,A Fine Journey Back,"I seem to like everything DeMille writes. As a miltary man myself, this was a special book. Drawing from his own personal experience this book is haunting and serious at times and funny at others as DeMille mixes his serious writing with his arid wit. His Paul Brenner character returns (General's daughter) and is a hero in the likes of Indiana Jones - but doing it more with his tongue than his fists. Our heroine, Susan Weber is quite the perfect compliment in this novel. And our Vilain, COL Mang is quite the foe. They're interaction keep the book moving. The humor is classic. The recollection of the war rivets you to your seat. While a bit dissappointed in how this one ends, I couldn't put it down until I got there."
1,Overhyped,"This book appears to have been written for size and weight as if the author were, like Walter Scott, being paid by the word. For at least the first 250 pages vitually nothing happens as the reader has to fight boredom in the vain hope that something is going to happen on the next page. But it doesn't. However my review is badly biased by having read Martin Cruz Smith's books which make this look sophomoric (as well as soporific)"
1,Garbage,"Garbage...fancifull and contrived. Filled with the insight and cliches of one who obviously did not serve in Vietnam. A much better choice is James Webb's ""Lost Soldiers."""
2,up country,"Not worth the effort and time to read. Too detailed such as many many pages devoted to the color of the foliage and the weather/rain. Too many pages about the cycle he road. In all I felt the book appeared to have been written by a ""green/new"" author not by a seasoned writer.Jeri Drake"
3,Tedious,"The writer has brought back Paul Brenner, warrant officer, in this sequel to The General's Daughter. It invoves a death in Vietnam that occurred thirty years earlier which draws Brenner out of retirement. The writer is a former officer during the War in Vietnam and returned for great amount of research prior to the writing of this book. The tale beins in Saigon and goes throughot the contry until it ends in Hanoi in North Vietnam. It seems that the author falls in love with his knowledge of the country and this sometimes affects the flow of th story. The flow is not as smooth as in some of his other books. Other than Brenner, the characters appear to lack the depth that I am looking for in a book. This is a fair read that I found to be tedious at times."
4,"Engrossing, amusing, disturbing - a great read!","I am a true DeMille fan. I love the way he captures his readers with his stories. Up Country is another home run. I don't remember much about Viet Nam and this story has helped to re-educate me on what a horrible war it was and what atrocities everyone went through on both sides.I like Paul Brenner and wonder how much of Nelson DeMille is really in Paul. Brenner is intelligent, funny, dangerous, and romantic. I love his interaction with the other characters in the story.It's a great read.I know a movie is going to be made of this book and I sure hope they do a better job with this book than they did with The General's Daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed that book but didn't think the movie did it justice."
5,excellent,"witty. funny. serious. satirical.yes, i did skip over some dreaded dialogue.overall, nelson deMille is always a good read!!"
1,Wanted: Editor,"I've always enjoyed DeMille's books -- until now. The author has evidently become such an icon (read: money-earner) in the publishing industry that no editor was willing to put this bloated novel into readable shape (I found myself skipping large portions of text). There are three stories here: a vet's return to Vietnam, a ""romance"" and a thirty-year murder. The vet's return is the most solid part of the book, although it could have been more tightly written. The mystery is potentially interesting, but gets too little attention throughout most of the 700 pages. The ""romance"" gets far too much attention -- although I was still left wondering what prompted the characters to declare their love within a few says of meeting. As Tina Turner would sing, ""What's love got to do with it?"" I hope Mr. DeMille does better next time, it would be hard to do worse."
1,up county,"I hav read many Nesion Demille novels and I have enjoyed them. However, after reading this novel I quite frankly felt he should be sending me a psyic fee for reading/listening to his drama of Viet Nam. Prior to this novel I would buy anything with his name attached to it/ after Up county I will at least read the first chapter before making my decison of purchase. . All I can say is Nelson get over it and get a Life. I really don't want to hear about your past life and your ego. Who do you think you are St Woods?- I quite frank ly feel think you shoud send me a check for my wasted time - I contined to read the novel hoping it would deveolp into something worthwide but it did not. I would not recommend this novel to anyone- except those with little brain cells"
2,"Typical Demille, but this one seems to drag","Another decent effort from DeMille, but this pales in comparison with his previous work, The Lion's Game. This seemed more of a walk down memory lane for DeMille rather than keeping the story and the characters in the forefront."
1,Tedious,"This book was a great disappointment to me. I kept slogging thru it, hoping for a light at the end of tunnel, which never materialized. The first three quarters of the book is a tedious travelogue. The small amount of suspense deMille manages to conjure up in the last quarter of the book never leads to anything. Leave this one on the shelf."
4,used but very nice,You could definitely tell it was used but it was still in great shape and you could not beat the price!! Especially for a hardback book!
3,enjoyed,"We are thinking about making a trip to Viet Nam and someone recommended this book to me. While the plot was pretty wild, I thoroughly enjoyed the history and culture. My husband and I were in college during the Viet Nam War. It so permeated our experience but I really didn't understand what was going on. This helped me put some of those experiences in perspective. It was also a fun fast read. In general I like Nelson DeMille's books--especially for long plane rides."
3,Worth the Read,"I enjoyed this book. A little change of scenery for DeMille which is nice, but the same fun characters. Well worth reading."
4,"un título tan poco conocido, muy buena película","Recuerdo este film cuando fue exhibido en mi país en 1978, casi pasó desapercibido, lo considero un ""clásico"", vale la pena verla, y recuerdo que era un precio de regalo."
2,BabySitter,"A foreign production, poor lighting, bad sound effects, if not for Vic Morrow and Robert Vaughn, no one would have bothered to watch the movie. The plot is simple. A rich man's son is kidnapped and kept in a derelict house in the outskirts of town. The only neighbor is a nosey old lady with her dog. A babysitter was hired to take care of the child while the kidnappers try to elicit ransom from the boy's father. Vic Morrow plays a stuntman, sent by the kidnappers to keep an eye on the babysitter and the kidnapped boy. When they attempted to seek help from the nosey old lady, both she and dog got killed. The kidnappers tried to outwit each other and keep the entire ransom. Alas, evil never triumphs and all ended up dead (by their own devices)."
1,Lewis and Clark for Dummies,"This was an interesting read. The authors were obviously not fans of the Corps of Discovery. The Corps seemed to bumble their way to the pacific, wreaking havoc to the environment and the Native population. They were even criticized for NOT having sex with the wife of a tribal leader.Jeez! This book is the far,far,left view of the event."
3,Smaller then I expected,"It's a really interesting book full of stories about kid's sensitivity to spiritual things, but it is so much smaller then I expected, it's a little book and then the font is pretty big so you are not getting much reading for the price you pay in my opinion."
2,Lacking,"I found this book to be lacking in substance and humor. And I really wanted it to be great, I did. I heard about it from the Oprah show, and had already heard the best stories before I read it. If you have heard anything about this book, anything at all, I would save yourself the 20 bucks. I was disappointed by this book, and found that it did NOT support all the hype. I got this book from the library for free, and STILL FOUND IT to FALL SHORT of the great reviews. It is a sad day for me."
2,Not impressed,"I was excited to receive this book, but was not impressed with the contents. There was too much written by adults in the beginning, so I guess by the time you got to the stories of the children, it was a let down. I also thought there could have been a lot more to it. It just wasn't all it was built up to be."
4,Great gift...,"I bought two of these books...one for myself and one as a gift. The recipient of the gift loved the book and shared it with her kids. Great as a sentimental, small gift for people with children."
4,Fun read,This was a really fun book to read. It was nice to see the innocence and wisdom of children compiled in one book.
3,shimmer,"a bit more golden shimmer to it than i would like but what can i say, i like this blush. it has a great texture and can look natural and fresh if applied the right way"
4,Great product,Love that this blush blends in so smoothly into your skin. It doesn't leave streaks like powder blush. Would definitely purchase again
3,Disappears,"Goes on really smoothly, color is good, but very little shows. I'm fair and don't like a lot of color, but this is not enough for me."
3,Darker than I thought,"It's a bit darker than I imagined, Expected it to look more like the pink frosting, But still a great buy!"
2,Not very good,The color is not good..it does not have a smooth finish and also a little sticky..over all its below my expectations.
2,Way too sparkly,"I was hoping that this would be a good formula to get my skin through the dry winter air. It is super creamy and blends easily. Unfortunately, the color is terrible. It's a very cotton candy pink, rather than the soft natural pink I wanted. It might work better on someone with a dark complexion - I'm very fair and it just looked costumey on me. Also, there's SO MUCH SPARKLE. It looks like I've splashed glitter all over my face. It might work for a middle school dance, but it's certainly not office appropriate."
3,Emm...,"Well, this blush was too light and too shimmery for my taste. Love the texture and the way it goes on, just wish it had less shimmer to it..."
2,Could have been better,"When I received this, I was surprised how small the container was. I was hoping the product would be great soon I was disappointed. The brush was way too creamy, I think it got melted and the color was way too soft(I got it in pink frosting) and it doesn't show on my skin, just some shimmer."
3,Not all that,"I think there are good colors with this mousse blush, but I have a hard time putting it on, I have to apply several times before I get anything and then it kind of blends into my face rather than defining my cheeks or whatever. So it's ok, but not all that. Definitely not a miracle wonder."
4,Still working on this one,"The trouble with uncontrolled adult A.D.D. is that purchasing the goal-setting forms is just one-tenth of the battle. Another tenth is admitting you have a problem. Another tenth is sorting out what your goals are versus what they should be. Another tenth is figuring out how to organize your life so that you can be goal-oriented.. well, you get the picture. I love the book. It has so much potential. I just need to keep working on making it work for me."
3,Very high level,"The content in this handbook is good (not a lot of ""filler"" content), but the book is much skinnier than I expected it to be. It's more of a pamphlet than a book. It gives a great high level overview of each personality type, but I'm left wanting a little bit more detail."
5,Apple pie anyone!,"Love it, not Deadwood but Raylan holds his own in this series. The humor is priceless. I come from below the Mason-Dixon and it doesn't bother me in the least. Looking forward to season three."
5,Justified,"Who doesn't just love Raylan? I've shared this set with girlfriends, and now they are fans as well! Can't wait for the 3rd season!"
5,Stun-ning,"It has been a long time since I've watched a show that kept my family speechless, even during the commercial breaks. In my opinion, it's at the very top of the television craft, and because it goes on and on for hours it's better than a movie could possibly be. I will be seeking out the writers and directors to see their other work ... not just the actors."
5,"Pre-ordered, Came quickly",Great tv show at a great price. I purchased this as the pre-order and it arrived on day two of its release.
4,California is not Kentucky,"I've watched ""Justified"" since the first episode and I've greatly enjoyed it. However, apart from the 1st episode, which was filmed in Pennsylvania, ""Justified"" is filmed in Southern California and it shows. If one looks closely, you'll see palm trees in the background of certain scenes. This really takes me out of the show and it reminds me of ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" where well worn Southern California shooting locations and studio backlots were stand-ins for North Georgia.It's still a good show though."
1,Very Dissatisfied!!!,Third of 3 discs completely cracked. Because I didn't open it for a while-still watching Season 1 Amazon refused to replace it.
5,It doesn't get any better . . . and I am afraid it wont.,"With characters like Mags Bennett, little Loretta, and Boyd Crowder, season 2 was the epitome of the fast action, shootem ups. Season 2 has now set the bar high and will be difficult to achieve a better season in the future.Margo Martindale as Mags Bennett helped season two stand out as a classic with her award winning performance. This season will definately be hard to top in the future of this modern day cowboy drama.I was impressed with every aspect of this season and reccommend it to all adults that like fast action dramas."
5,Addictive,"Justified is well worth the money. This show is very addictive. My husband and I, watched the whole second season in one day. We could not stop watching this show!"
4,Slow on the up swing!,Much slower going than season one. Well written and acted. Story development better than season one. Hopefully more action in season 3.
5,another 5 star review,"What can I add? Someone recently turned me on to this amazing series. The best acting, best delivery, best script on tv. As enjoyable as it gets."
5,Season 2,Has season 2 of Justified ever been released on blu-ray???? I've had my order in since last year.I have season 1 and it is awesome.
5,Justified: The Complete Second Season,This is an awesome series and I would invite anyone to watch all three series. Season Four is on now! Raylan and Boyd are great adversaries. Don't miss it!
1,Justified 2nd Season,Cant rate it yet the copy u sent me didnt work waiting for the new copy to be sent to me..sue
5,i loved it!,I love Justified.... I love Timothy Olyphant and I love Raylan! I am hooked!Raylan is so sexy! He's like a 21st Century Marshall Dillon!
5,Love the show!,"I bought this because the show and Timothy Olyphant are so great. I already have loaned it out to my brother, who had never seen the show. He watched Season 1 and now cannot wait to see Season 2. I can't wait to watch it again."
5,Love this series,"My husband and I started watching this series shortly before the third series began. We bought the first two series on DVD to catch up. We love the colorful characters living in the rural Kentucky mining country. The episodes are funny and exciting, sometimes pretty violent, but there is usually a touch of country humor. Thye music, especially the theme song, is fabulous!!We look forward to season three!"
4,Crackerjack writing continues,This series continually surprises and crackles with dry humor. It continues to be so well written. We love watching it!
3,Justifies-2nd season,"I still like Olyphant as the marshall but the whole Megs thing was too contrite-didn't like the big guy that fell down the mine shaft-didn't like Dicky-didn't like the other brother that got it at the end-didn't like the little girl or her father that was poisoned-hated to see Helen go, she was one of my favorite characters and I especially didn't like the side tracking with the ex-hope the 3rd season is better but all in all, I guess it's worth watching"
5,Justified,Excellent !!! Looking forward to veiwing the 3rd & 4th seasons of Justified. One of the best originial series that is on the air !!!
5,Excellent,Great story lines and acting! A must see! blah blah blah blah blah blah yada yada yada yada yada blah yada blah
2,Justified season two,"The show Justified is my favorite. The DVD from Amazon, however, has a flaw, which rendered the third disc unviewable. This is the second time I have received a bad DVD from Amazon. From now on, I'll purchase my DVDs from Barnes and Noble because they accept returns at full value. I've given the DVD two stars for the two discs that were not damaged."
1,Poor video quality,The show is fine but the video quality on the DVD is very poor. I have a new Panasonic LCD TV and Sony DVD player and the picture is so dark I can't see half the scenes. Adjusted the picture settings on the TV and it still is to dark. Get the Blue-ray or digital version and skip the DVD version.
1,Region code error - not as advertised on the box,"Heads up for anyone in a (blu-ray) Region B area -The packaging is clearly marked Region AB. This is a mistake, the discs WILL NOT PLAY in a Region B player.Unfortunately I bought this over the counter in Canada while on holiday and cannot return for a refund. Sony as yet have not returned my email re this false labelling.If you are in a Region B area treat this as Region A locked and unplayable. I note Amazon have listed it as a (DVD) Region Code 1.Pity, I was really looking forward to this set..."
1,Title not region B even if the box says it is.,"Region B buyers beware. I live in europe and ordered the second season of Justified on blu-ray because the packaging says it's region A and B. This is not true, the package is mislabeled. This version of justified is region A only. Shame because I was looking forward to watching this fantastic show again."
1,amazon leaves much to be desired,videos more often than not have problems loading...hard to enjoy a show....netflix no problem....dont even try to tell me its my ISP because I have tried more than one at the same time.....
4,I am hooked on this show.,Justified is a fun show to watch. I do not like Rayland's wife's character. She is too wishy washy. I enjoy the character interactions in the Marshal office and Rayland's interaction with his acquaintances from Harlan. I love how everyone has such good manners when they are planning to kill you. Southern boys raised right.
5,Just keeps getting better!,"I didn't hesitate pre-ordering the second season. I immediately bought the first season DVD's when they were available. I want to be able to watch these shows over and over the next few years. As an East Tennessean, I can identify with some of the mannerisms and characters that are set in Kentucky and the Southern U.S. The strength of ""Justified"" is that any one of the characters can stand on their own regardless of whether they are appearing frequently or just for one or two episodes. The story lines and acting is superb. The dialogue is catchy and just when you think you've figured out what will happen next you are pleasantly surprised in many cases. I will say this to anyone who has not yet watched an episode. Try it. You'll be hooked. You'll start looking forward to each week's show and get caught up in the stories. I wish ALL television series were as tight and as superbly written, directed and produced as ""Justified"". Bring on the next season soon!"
5,the best,Justfied is THE best show on tv now. Tim is prefect for his role with his quiet charisma. This series is the only series that kept me watching every minute of it. sometimes it shocks me out of my seat and the western movie feel that it has is just awesome !!
5,Justified,"Justified is the best show on t.v. the writing, the acting, it pulls you in and Timothy Olyphant plays one of the coolest characters ever! Really need to see the first season before you watch the rest. Awesome!"
4,Justified,"Wonderful scrip, amazing performance, I just love it! All the actors are the best and is great entertainment! I look forward for more of this."
5,great show!,"Only ""cop"" show I like. Great actors. Great writers, Great action with lots of suprises.Absolutely wonderful. Good enough to watch again & again."
5,Action Adventure,Timothy Olyphant is a very good action actor. He plays a no-nonsense US Marshall with a history of the back country of Kentucky. Buy the first season if you have not seen it and you will get the history needed to better enjoy the second season.
5,Bruno's review of Justified,"Waiting breathlessly for Justified second season, please ship as soon as possible. My friends and family are on the edge of their seats waiting for the Second Season Justified to come in the mail. Don't delay."
5,On of the best shows on air now......,"Finally a show with good writing!None of the stupidity and ""cheap"" plots of so many othershows currently on the air .....Plus great actorsMust buy!"
5,steamy,I bought this product because I have very dry skin that gets very dry and cracks. this product and aquaphor are great for my skin and does wonders. half hour a day and kind of makes the skin look youthful my opinion only. good for opening up sinuses as well. if you want it really hot lay a towel on top the sauna.
4,excellent,"I really like this product. I had a smaller one in the past. and I loved it too.This new one is too tall for me and I cannot feel the same hot steam as I used to feel with a little one. However, the smaller one was kind of uncomfortable. You cannot get your head in it and the only way to use is is to be seated. Defenitely, I would recommend this product"
1,Buy a crock pot!,I had higher expectations. I have a sinus cyst so I was looking for something to help. There simply was not enough steam to feel a sense of benefit. The tent is small and not sturdy enough to lean on the plastic walls. You need to be standing to be high enough to reach the steam that does collect but that did not feel relaxing to me. I was going to send it back but with the shipping and restocking fees I would have lost about half my money. I am using just the base as a humidifier with essential oils. My doctor laughed and said it would be cheaper and to use a crock pot. I do like the automatic shut off valve. So it is better than a crock pot!
3,Good music,"Would have liked this CD better if it had been more with singing of Alfonso Sainz and Lucas Sainz, rather than must instrumental."
3,"Not what it is cracked up to be, but my son still loves it!","The screen feels cheap and like it is about to fall apart. Basically it is like a magnadoodle, but a button makes the eraser bar move back and forth automatically to clear the screen. It feels very flimsy!The buttons make random phrases, other than that there is no real interaction. Nothing changes on the screen, you can't actually program the childs apts or set any alarm.But, my 2yo still finds pushing the buttons very entertaining, so it is not a complete waste."
2,Disappointing and forgettable,"As a self-confessed bibliophile, I hoped the contributions to this book would evoke and reflect the peculiar state of mind that booklovers get during the reading experience--something on the order of Tom Raabe's ""Biblioholism,"" or ""Reading in Bed."" However, I found this book to be quite a disappointment. The entries are, as a group, unremarkable and fail to engage the emotions (at least for me). Just a very few of the passages were interesting or evocative enough to flag for future reflection. I did not keep this book, unlike others on the subject of bibliomania."
3,Masterclass with incomplete information,"The title of the book leads one to expect to receive the technical information needed to try any of the techniques demonstrated. The book does not always live up to this promise. For example, the multilayered slip technique presented by Mary Barringer demonstrates the use of slips before and after bisquing. The most critical factor here would be the composition of the slip to accommodate the shrinkage of the bisque. Granted, there are many slip recipes out there, but not all will work here. I don't need to see pictures of her brushing the slip on. That is the stuff of beginner books (if even) not ""Master classes"". The physical techniqes of building , modelling and shaping are well illustrated, and so the book does have its value. Michael Sherril's use of extruded clay to make his fantastic sculptures was eyeopening, and well demonstrated."
4,A Facinating Book,"I especially enjoyed the work of Sergei Isupov and Michael Sherrill, but none of the other artists were less than spectacular including the gallery of complementary work. I'm especially appreciative of the artists for sharing their inovative techniques with us. Thanks to the Penland School, also, for bringing their art to our attention."
3,"You Missed the Co-Author, William K. Dick","This book oughtta generate a few more sales after the release of National Enquireer editor Iain Calder's ""The Untold Story"" at the end of the month (July 04). Gris and co-author William K. Dick went behind the Iron Curtain 6 times for the National Enquirer, bringing back 'psychic secrets' to the U.S. for this book and an 'untold' story of escape through one of the Baltic states.Not a white-knuckle thriller, but a nice background on what Iain's minions might have been doing in the seventies."
1,Awesome waste of money,"Dont waste your money on a HELIX POWER TOWER. I am a 28 year ASE mechanic, and this is a real money and time waster. I installed it in my Toyota V-6 Tacoma and after 1 month of regular commuting with a very well maintained vehicle and senible driving I found no fuel mileage improvement and no power increase as described by Amazon and the HELIX POWER TOWER packaging."
2,Disappointed,"I should have looked at the physical size of the book before I bought it. It is a coffee table book. The pictures are all drawings and water colors of artists who travelled in Egypt, no photographs. Although they are mostly beautiful, it was not as I expected. Each ""traveler"" gets about 6 paragraphs, hardly an in-depth history of Egyptian exploration. I can't recommend anyone spend this kind of money on the book."
1,Well at least Uma Thurman's accent is funny.,"This is a talking head movie where nothing really happens except for people talking to each other or at each other. The main topic is alcoholism as John Pryce tells the alcoholic poet that AA is a cult. Then he goes and talks to Uma Thurman who has one of the most atrocious fake accents since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins.Then someone else talks and they talk and they talk and they talk. These are boring characters having boring philosophical discussions about alcoholism. This movie is less entertaining than hearing your just-out-of-rehab friend preach at you about your drinking.As Jonathan Pryce says in one scene - ""I don't want to bore you with what you already know."" Sadly, he does. And so does everyone else."
2,To AA or not to AA,"Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):1. This is a movie adaptation of a play by David Hare2. It centers around three characters3. It deals with alcoholism and infidelity4. But mostly it's a debate on the value of the AA programme5. I would have fallen asleep, but zinc beds are too darned uncomfortableSlow moving, rather dry British movie fails to hold the viewer's interest despite the efforts of Jonathan Pryce as a somewhat annoying wealthy businessman and Uma Thurman as his trophy wife. Paddy Considine's character runs the gamut from boring to blotto to bewildered, stopping just a tad short of believable.I've read that the original play is bewitching, but the magic certainly hasn't transferred to the big screen.Recommended only as punishment for alcoholics and cheaters.Amanda Richards, April 10, 2009"
1,No comment again for this Lovin Spoonful CD!,I think the Anthology is way better than any other music listening enjoyment but don't get Summer In The City: The Encore Collection it's just a waste of money value for a buyer in my opinion!
5,"Good, sturdy, reliable","I bought this tool because it's been used in my IT department for several years, and one of them recommended it to me. It crimps RJ-11 phone and RJ-45 ethernet cables. It's really awkward to use the cutter to cut the cable if a plug is still attached (it's almost impossible to fit an RJ-45 plug through), so plan to use with a separate wire cutter. Also it's better and easier to cut the insulation with a box cutter than the built-in cutter. Otherwise, though, this has proven to be solid and reliable. Thumbs up from this corner."
4,one of a genre...,"This is one of a series of 'tell all' books published by former Catholic sisters. There are fewer readers interested in this topic these days, but for anyone still interested, this is a good read, especially as it contains a story about how a priest, Cardinal MacIntyre of Los Angeles, managed to destroy one of the most vital congregations of sisters in the Catholic Church."
5,The best book on combat shooting that I have ever read!,"Though this book is nearly 60 years old, and the techniques described in it were developed between the World Wars, this is still by far the best book I have ever read on combat pistol shooting. With only a few changes to reflect current pistol design and shooting doctrine, you could still use this as a manual for instruction today. In many ways the book is way ahead of its time as it recommends self-loading pistols over revolvers, discusses stopping power, body armour and suggests a layout for a tactical range that would be familiar to military/law-enforcement/IPSC shooters today. Thoroughly recommended to anyone who might have to use a pistol in a combat situation or who simply has an interest in the origins of modern tactical shooting techniques."
3,Overpriced but Interesting look at history,"Fairbairn and Sykes were way ahead of their time. Many of the concepts in this book can be seen today in several different forums; tactical pistol shooting techniques, concealed carry weapon and holster design, indoor shoot houses, moving target training and competition.That said, there is some advice that has not proven itself over time. For example, they recommend you disable the safety on the 1911 and carry it without one in the pipe. Most people would disagree with that advice today for tactical as well as legal reasons.Formatted as a small pocket book with a fuzzy ""manual typewritter"" font, with only 96 pages it can be read in a single session. A historically significant book that is well worth reading but overpriced."
5,Combat Shooting,"Shooting To Liveoffers great thoughts on the Fairbairn and Sykes method of point shooting. They educates a surprising amount of ""modern"" material for a book written in the early part of the 20th century.A few points I enjoyed:-Fairbairn and Sykes trained on negative targets.-They incorporated failure-to-fire drills into their training.-Fairbairn and Sykes utilized different gun positions based on proximity of the threat. And they fired off of the centerline.-I found one point of particular interest is the ideal sight design for a defensive pistol (an express style sight as used on big game rifles, with the front sight being a large bead of ivory or silver). An Very worthwhile purchase and read."
4,Shooting to Live,"This 1942 reprint was the first Practical Handgun Training Book for Police and Military. Experience taken from years with the Shanghi China Police Dept who patrolled the most dangerous streets in the World, this book was a compulation of what worked in over 600 deadly encounters between police officers using only handguns and criminals attempting to kill them. This is a great piece of history of law enforcement."
5,Shooting to Live - a must read,"quick, decisive description on how to survive a deadly threat by using a handgun, I highly recommend, the information is timeless."
3,Over rated?,"This book endorses point shooting, which is an extremely important tactic in close quarters gun fighting. The mention of this concept in 1942 is definitely way ahead of its time. However, I was expecting to hear more about the 600+ gun fights that this methodology was based on and how those events influenced the methodology. Perhaps I was expecting more but it seemed to be a very cursory look at the topic. There are several training routines mentioned that a student could set up and practice. Overall, I was underwhelmed. This is a starting point if someone is picking it up as an introduction to point shooting but nothing more. A live training class or DVD would be money better spent."
4,That's my car gun. *snickers*,"I just think James Coburn is sexy. If you like the camp of the Flint movies, give it a try. It is not as delicious, feels more dated, somehow, not so iconic, but some good moments. Seeing lanky Coburn dressed as a wigged hippie banging a gong will give you a good long laugh."
5,One of The best 60's Films ever made.,One would consider this an Indie film because few people knew about it and it had a brilliant supporting cast.Severn Darden and Godfrey Cambridge among the many actors who made this film Incredible and a soundtrack that was pure 60's.James Coburn was definitely The Man in the 60's.
4,Leslie Nielsen on Steroids,"This is not the dopiest movie I've ever watched, but it's close. It at least rivals Rowan Atkinson's portrayal of ""Johnny English,"" and out-stupid's any Leslie Nielsen film I've ever watched. I can't say it wasn't enjoyable; I mean, I enjoy a bit of slapstick from time to time (elsewise, I would not know about Johnny English, or even more so, the Black Adder series). The one thing that puzzled me was the ending of the stage play. I still haven't been able to figure out the last scene, which I won't describe here because of potential viewers who might buy the DVD. Overall, I'd give this film a high rating if you love ""Silly."" But if you're looking for some insight into the mind of an American president (or any other president) you're bound to be disappointed."
1,Injusice made to James Coburn,"It is an injustice made to James Coburn, in letting him having to star in such a silly film"
4,"It seems oh, so current","Released in the 1960s, this film is a satiric look at the 60s, at Cold War tensions, at secrecy, at psychiatry, at government, and a few other themes. Substitute the ""global war on terror"" and fits ever so nicely as a film for the 21st century."
2,not optimistic,the vhs version runs 103 minutes according to imdb. amazon's listing for the dvd says 102 minutes. that doesn't sound like restored footage. they probably didn't bother to correct the music problem either. it's really too bad. this is one of my all-time favorite films. it would be 5 stars if they got it right.
3,"A Bit Drawn Out, Implasusible, and Just Plain Silly -","Coburn stars as a psychiatrist who is unknowingly selected to provide counseling for the president. After a short stint doing so, however, Coburn becomes stressed out himself, and then paranoid - worrying about agents from other nations trying to capture him. So he flees his job and the movie then morphs into a never-ending chase as those foreign agents try to capture him and learn what he's learned from the sessions with the president. Meanwhile, the U.S. FBR has decided to kill Coburn to prevent this from occurring. Fortunately the movie's producers had a time and budget limit, and the farce eventually ends."
4,"Isn't as good as I remembered it as being, but still good","A lot of sixties films have not dated well, and this one definitely falls into that category. A few scenes--especially those involving music--are as bad as anything that came out of the sixties. But enough of the movie works that its lapses are overlooked and forgotten. James Coburn is especially fine in the title role."
5,Superb comment on the state of telecommunications,"The movie concentrates on the troubles encountered by being the president's analyst, but moves to spy type thriller / comedy with a wonderful sateric ending.Anyone involved in the telecommunication industry or anyone that has ever uttered anger with 'ma bell' should see this film."
5,Everyone Hates The Phone Company,"This is a truly great movie. Of course the joke is now on us. Every phone IS now really bugged (as the NSA more or less admits). And, with ATT now owningTCI cable television, who doesn't again hate the phone company? Check out Art Buchwald's circa 1962 column on Theodore J. Flicker's fight with the phone company over an answering machine."
4,Analysis and Management of Animals Populations,"Delivery time ok, price really good in comparison to others, the book only has a litle brake in the cover but it was in excelent condition."
5,Good Quality,The product arrived quickly and on time. I would do business with this company agian without a second thought.
1,Save your money for something better!,"This ""book"" has very little to nothing going for it, except for the small amount about the 3 featured artist. It is really nothing more than a dumbed down internet browser. Even though it provides you quick links to certain sites, the URL display is disabled and also ""right clicking"" making it impossible to even know the address of the site you are visiting or to bookmark it. Further many of the links are broken or already out of date.The graphics on the CD tend to be low resolution, low quality and quite small. There is no way that you can blow up a particular graphic to get a better look."
1,Worst of the worst!,"Don't waste your money! There is nothing of value in this so called ""book!"" Anyone reading it should be PAID to do so."
1,....,".... Most of the links are repeated over and over. Some of the pictures are good, but a large portion of them are very poor quality, and don't give credit to the artists that created the works...."
5,A touching expression of all the best our Moms have done.,"I was amazed at how much this book touched me in so few words. It's a reminder of all the best of what my Mom did for me. With all the family around, I read it to Mom last Mothers' Day. We all cried. What a blessing!"
1,Repulsive,This was the worst tasting stuff. I guess sugar free is not the way to go on dark chocolate.
5,Nice Product,I've had this in my LG Dare phone for almost two years. The music that is stored on this card is crisp and clear even after playing the songs over and over. I'm now up grading to a Transcend 8GB Micro-Secure Digital Card
4,Combines a favorite pastime with effective feedback,"I live with chronic pain. To get my mind off it, I often play computer games. This product satisfies that interest while providing postive benefit through biofeedback. The exercises help me to relax and stop ""bracing"" my muscles. I would recommend this to others."
2,Put it Back in the Box,"I hate to sound so negative... and I do think the idea behind this product is very good. I'd very much like to learn biofeedback via computer imaging.However, installation was a nightmare and things went downhill from there. Trying to use the product was certainly counterproductive to learning to relax.I believe this particular unit was defective... since I got so many error messages about installation failures and such, maybe that screwed up everything else.Not being fantastically computer savvy, I could not sort all that out.So I give this item credit for being something interesting that I wanted to buy, but the fact it did not work... well... yeah... can't say it was condusive to anything other than putting it back in the box."
1,This watch does not have blue face,This watch does not have a blue face like this photo shows so be careful if you really want a blue face watch. The watch is just grey in the face.
4,Good for Kindergarten,I teach Kindergarten and have found the patriotic books for this level difficult to locate. This book was perfect for the students. They were able to relate to simple text and LOVED the beautiful and bright pictures. What a great find!
3,Old Glory,An easy read book for young children. Facts at the end of the book make it useful for older children too.
1,BOORRRRRINGGGG,"Honestly, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cure for insomnia. ""I'm Gonna Be Dead Someday"" is so shamelessly dumb, derivative and boring that it defies any form of criticism. Why is this considered ""edgy""? Because he swears and likes porn stars? Big whoopity doo!!! I LOVE Bill Hicks, Kinison, etc - truly edgy comedy is great. I just happen to think that Rogan is a fairly stupid guy with a lot of opinions. That's my feeling on it. There's nothing on here that you couldn't hear at a million comedy clubs and open mike nights by guys with a lots of swagger and posture, wearing a pleather jacket and talking about how much porn they watch. I'm getting awfully sick of fake comics hashing out the same bits. If this were the 90s, he'd be doing jokes about Dan Quayle and calling it social commentary. Save your money. This CD is so inoffensive I'd recommend ""The Lion King On Ice""."
1,not soon enough!,"Disappointed in the content; wasn't fully sure what to expect but I would have liked more singing and less attempt at noxious comedy. Not really even funny come to think about it, noxious or otherwise. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't."
4,Pretty Good! It's like Stanhope at 60%,Sorry Joe but your buddy Doug's got you beat in stand up. I really do like this album though. I thought it was going to be some middle of the road bs. Very happy with how dirty it was. I'd buy another album if he put it out.
4,A scorching crticism,Though there are some errors in his historical procedure - Hallahan sometimes puts out info and dosen't back it up with historical data the book is excellent. If one believes that our goverment and senior leadership supplies only the best equipment to our troops read this book. If one thinks that goverment can run ANYTHING more efficiently then private industry read this book. And if one is thinking about enlisting head full of Tom Clancy's prose and recruiting commercials - well you know. I wish this book was still in print. An excellent read.
3,"Careful, Hallahan","While the author presents a very interesting and enlightening view of army ordnance and small arms, the book has some holes. The most annoying with respect to the thesis is that the author consistently introduces men in the Ordnance department as new and progressive, and then two pages later they're reactionary with no explanation of the transformation.Furthermore, as soon as he strays from strictly smallarms matters (especially in the chapters concerning the period between the World Wars), his statements vary from misleading to blatantly incorrect. Also, he describes the Dreyse needle-gun, differently, three times, and only gets it right once. This leads me to doubt the accuracy of the book with weapons I am not as familiar with. Finally, there are a surprising number of typos and grammatical errors.I highly recommend reading it, but keep a supply of salt grains handy while you do."
4,Agree with Hallahan,"After 17 years and counting of Army service, some of which was spent as an enlisted infantryman, and others as an Ordnance officer, I agree with Hallahan's premise that bureaucracy and personal agendas have often hampered the selection and implementation of effective small arms. I also agree with his assessment that the ""gravel belly"" concept is largely outdated. His synopsis of the histories of our different small arms over the years is very telling in that regard.Like other reviewers, however, I am a bit dismayed at the number of typographical errors in the book, especially since the publisher is a major (and respected) one. In addition, Hallahan seems to be unfamiliar with some basic firearms terminology, often using ""clip"" and ""magazine"" interchangeably -- which they are NOT.Overall, I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in firearms or military history, but as others have said, keep your salt nearby."
3,"On the small side, not really worth the price.","This toy is well-made, but very skimpy. The lamb is very thin and not soft and fluffy. there is a collar on the lamb which could come loose and easily be swallowed. I am re-ordering a much larger toy from the AKC collection, this toy is a disappointment and I do not recommend it."
3,"AKC Classic Plush Country Lamb, Small","Pepi, our dog, liked it but it is somewhat big for him to play with as he is a toy poodle. He still carries it around in his mouth and puts it to bed on a chair in the living room. Cute! It came in mint condition and was timely in the delivery."
4,Listening to hofmann's Beethoven.,"Well, this album contains many beethoven works played by hofmann and that's interesting because it's hard to find in other series. But the result is not so satisfying. The touch is too light in Concerto, and tempo is too fast in Waldstein. Chopin works are beautifully played, but many of those can be found in other discs. In my opinion Ballade No. 4 is an ideal performance. Only Corot's recording can stand next to hof. Recommand to Hofmann fans or Chopin manias."
4,excellent,"i was lucky enough to see beau twice before he died. the first time was at the fabulous rock and bowl in new orleans, where he was staging yet another battle with boozoo chavis. imho, virtually all music (zydeco, blues, classical...) is best experienced live. beau was a big man with a big sound and a big voice. this cd comes as close as possible to capturing the intensity of his performances.GIT IT, BEAU!!!"
1,Misleading condition,"I decided to purchase this product ""New,"" with the guarantee that it was ""factory sealed,"" and when the VHS arrived it was clear that the factory sealing was around a very used video. It not only had a ""Sale $4.99"" sticker on the slip cover, but it also had a ""50 cent charge if not rewound"" sticker directly on the video. Had I known I was getting a used video anyway I would have simply paid the lower price!"
4,Great value for everyday photographer.,"You can spend a lot of money on a carbon fiber monopod but this aluminum built Velbon RUP-40 is light, sturdy, and fulfills most of my needs. I use it for my Canon 30D with a 300mm telephoto lens and it works great. Most importantly, it opens up to 62.3"" which is long enough for a tall person (up to 6ft.) yet when folded at 19.1"" it fits easily in most backpacks."
4,Solid,"Solid construction, small, light and good price. The only gripe I have is that it does not have a shoulder strap."
3,"Decent for $20, but NOT heavy duty.","The Velbon RUP-40 monopod is fine. It's not noticeably flimsy, but it's by no means heavy duty. With both hands, you can easily push it closed when it's fully extended, but it should hold the weight of a pro-sized camera and phat lens fine as long as you don't lean on it when shooting.The problem is the section clamp things (what are they called?). They are common plastic. So not only are they incapable of holding the sections open tightly now, in time when the plastic wears down, the legs will be harder and harder to keep extended, and there will nothing you can do about it. In a sense, it's a disposable monopod.Even so, I paid $20, so I feel I received a decent deal. But in a year, I will probably wish I bought something better.Also, I bought mine from rhpepsi1, who sent what I'm almost certain is a used monopod, with scuffs and dings that were concealed with black marker. Not cool."
2,You get what you pay for...,"For the price, what can you expect? It's a poor-quality, made in China product. The colours are a little off (the blue is way too dark), but that's not a huge deal. The second time I raised it in a moderately windy day, the bottom grommet ripped through.If you're looking for something to just hang in your dorm window or something, this will do. Don't expect to use it as a real flag though."
3,Different colors than in the picture,"I mostly like this toy. It's very soft, and my daughter really likes it. The only problem is that it's different color than in the picture. The one I received has pale peach accents instead of pink on it's face and legs. Pink woul've been much prettier."
3,Subtitles are Screwed Up,"This is clearly a 3+ Star foreign film based on the originality of plot, quality of acting. mood/ambience, exotic foreign locales, and social message, etc. However, the enjoyment level is severely compromised, since the English subtitles inexplicably vanish for long stretches of dialogue. I've noticed this phenomenon in other Israeli films as well, and it is a serious disservice to the hearing-challenged community."
5,Silly Sauce,"My five-year-old son just received this game last week. He can not put it down. He especially loves the silly sauce game and the money. He has a deep fascination for numbers and money, so those games come ""easily"" to him. He'll be 6 in a couple of months.I agree with the other posters that say this is not for a child under the age of 5, not if you want them to actually play and learn from the games and not just guess at them. Spongebob is a hit in this house!"
5,Great game for Leapster 2,"My grandsons sit and play this for a long time. The 4 year old not as long, but the 6 year old plays it for long periods of time. Has been great on cold days, rainy days and other days the kids have to stay inside. My nieces also like this game when they visit - ages 8 and 10."
4,Leapster game - Sponge Bob Square Pants,"My 5 and 6 year old boys love this game over all their other Leapster games. It was a good buy, and it's great for road trips."
4,Good for 4 years and older kids,"this game is a little bit difficult for my 3.5 year old son, i am hoping in a year or so it can be useful to him."
3,o.k.,This is supposed to be the best? It feels very nice in my hand. I can feel the liquid inside moving around. But I got some hard ice cream the other day from a store and it took a lot more of effort than the product description made it out to be. I am no expert on ice cream scoops but this can't be th best. However it does feel nice in the hand and softer ice cream scoops fine and the scoops seem to be a nice size. All in all I still was able to eat my fav. choc. peanut butter cup!!
3,"such fun, but doesn't hold charge","This is a FANTASTIC toy for the kitties, however, it only runs one time and then won't recharge."
3,radio rodent,Well the cat likes and plays with it I myself don't like how you have to plug the mouse into the remote to charge it A battery would have been better
1,Won't hold charge,"The rodent does recharge from the controller, but unfortunately the charge only lasts about five seconds. One good run then recharge. Controls are erratic. Ad is totally misleading."
2,Does not hold a charge!,"While my cats love this toy, it only runs for a minute or two before you have to put it back on the charger. Additionally, it is very erratic and I don't mean in a good way. Sometimes it will work, then it will be unresponsive, and then it will start running again.It would be really great it if worked correctly."
1,total disaster,"First of all, it looked like package was previously opened (shipped from Amazon) and manual/instruction was missing. Second, the antenna would not stay in remote/charger/hamburger. I have no clue how to assemble this two together. Perhaps, some piece is missing. Or that the original idea? To add more fun: drop the antenna , pick antenna and put it back? And the last, mouse can run only 2 sec. Some people wrote 5 sec, or even a minute. I did not get this result."
1,Only has six foot range. Not much fun for the price,"Item is cute, but that's about it. Only has a range of six feet so not much fun. On switch is also extremely tiny and hard to see. Not worth $30.00."
5,The Best yet!!,"This is the best yet of Shaggy's work!! It has the best songs yet.. ""Wasn't Me"" and ""Angel"" an inspirational peice."
4,Four-Cup Fat Separator with Strainer,"The thin glass spout alerts you to be VERY careful. This Catamount Fat Separator is heat proof, flame proof, microwave save, and basically very durable. Just don't change the temperature too quickly from really cold to very hot. And, of course, no dropping on your marble counter top or floor. It works ideally. Follow simple instructions and you'll see how easy it is to separate fats from juices so you can get on to making gravy or pot & pan clean-up."
5,I bought this to strain my raw milk into a lower fat item,It works well and my only issue is that the milk easily can over flow if you fill it past the marks on the cup.
3,"Great idea, poor execution","This is a handy little tool if you are into Asian cooking, because you can freshly toast sesame seeds - so much better flavor than the bottled sesame seeds that come already toasted - and they don't pop out of the pan while toasting because of the screen on the top.HOWEVER...the metal darkens with age, the handle gets hot when it is over the flame/burner, and the thing cannot be put in the dishwasher because it will rust. Thank you very much, but in the future, I'll just use my ordinary pan and use a grease screen to prevent the seeds from popping out."
3,rethink,I had previously slammed this item. The seller made it a point to call me and explain how to use it and why it was of a very light aluminum. She called back several times as i was away on business. i am even more impressed with the customer service than the article itself. This business takes pride in what they sell and how the customer feels about what they purchase. Kudos to them. I will buy from them again.sunni zions
4,great product!,"I bought one of these after looking at all the competition. I really like this one! I wish the skin had a screen protector, and click-wheel protection, but otherwise, I like the skin, too.I think that the armband's velcro has been upgraded lately-I heard of the stuff falling off before, but this one has no such issues. It also looks different from the earlier ones I have seen reviewed.Also works with the iSkin"
2,Bad Velcro,"Although its a good deal since it came with a skin, the first time i took it out of the package and undid the armband, the velcro patch came clean off. I get the feeling it may happen again if i buy again. Not sure i will buy another one."
2,band ripped,Have had this for two weeks. Loved it at first but the band is ripping from the metal screws in the back. Shame because it is a perfect fit...
2,Hard to get into,"The plastic is really thick and hard to get an iPod mini in and out of. If you move your iPod between docking stations and speakers, this is too cumbersome to deal with."
4,Painting In Oils,"I have purchased over 12 books on painting, but this books beats them all. This is a must for the person who is a beginner."
5,William Palluth,"Mr William Palluth passed away last November , 2011. He will be well remember by his family, and for his beautiful spirit. He was a deeply religious man. His artwork reflected all this and more. He worked on many, many things, painting, writing, art classes, classes in religion, videos, DVD's. He was into many things, he was never idle.... He will be missed..."
3,Any Given Sunday,"I'm looking for the title to the instrumental when Willy Beaman first get into the game after both QB are hurt, can someone help!"
3,WHATS THIS SONG?????,"In the begining of the movie when Steaming Willie Beamin first goes in (right after he throws up) a song starts to play. Its an instrumental. It plays as he is in for the first time at the begining of the movie. PLEASE PLEASE if anyone knows this song, post up the title of it and the name of the artist. The song is B U T FUL!"
4,The missing songs,"Sadly most of the short, very cinematic music clips from Any Given Sunday are yet to be released on CD. This new second edition contains many of the tracks that viewers wanted so in that way it's good value for money.What I would like to know though is what is the name of the track which plays during the final climatic play where Willie Beamen runs into the endzone while Pacino's face is overlapped on Willie's face...string music, amazingly beatiful..anyone know who made that track??"
2,"However, Yet another song is missing...","I honestly don't know if this song is on any of the records,if it is I've missed it, however I would like to know the nameof the song. It's played just as game is about to start, and is some kind of disco/techno up-tempo song. The camera angle isfrom high up in the stadium looking down on the empty field below.PSIf I'm not mistaking, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, is not on eitherof the cds (on the subject of missing songs).DS"
3,Help me,"In this movie, they play a song that's also used in a Tiger Woods commercial where Tiger is playing his ball around a big city and ultimately putts it into a paper cup lying on a bridge. Anybody know what that song is and who sings it?"
3,missing song,"Okay, there is one song that is played several times during the movie, and I can't seem to find it anywhere. After the last game, when Pacino leaves Willie BEamen standing alone in the field, that songs starts to play. Pacino makes his way to the press conference, and the song is still playing during the first half of the press conference. It's pretty slow, mostly drums, guitar and and piano. If anyone could help me out on this, I'd appreciate it."
2,Another missing track,"Along with some of the other mentioned missing tracks in the CD, I have found another track that was in the movie but not on the CD. It was Fatboy Slim's ""Right Here, Right Now"", which can be heard when Willie Beamon was brought into the first game shown in the movie as the quarterback after losing the first two due to injury. This song is a great song and should've definitely been in the mix of the soundtrack along with other missing tracks."
3,"PLEASE HELP ME, PLEASE","I want to know if there is a track for the music which is played right after Willie wins the last game. He is talking with Pacino on the empty stadium and if you raise the volume of your television you will hear a voice singing, it is beautiful, please let me know what track it is. Help me. I have been looking for it for years.Thanks."
3,help!!,"please someone help i am trying to find the song at the end when they score the last touchdown, it is instrumental and is really beautiful! its not on for long but is just when willie has the ball and runs at the defense in the dying seconds of the game any help is appreciated"
2,Why did they have to ruin the speech song with dialogue??,"Hi folks.The only reason I was interested in this album was for the song that plays when Al Pachino says his speech at the end of the film. The music was beautiful, and the price of the album ws worth this one song. When i heard the song, fianlly, I discovered they completley ruined it with stupid dialogue-its almost impossible to hear the song!!If anybody knows if there is a version out there without dialogue, could you tell me the title and the artist, PLEASE!!I am pretty sure it is score, so there probably isnt such a version out there, but in the event that there is, please let me know.Thanks."
3,One of the Missing Songs yall are looking for,"I think its the one that plays during the end scene as Pacino heads into the press room to address his outgoing speech I'm not sure but its ""Use Me Up"" by Bill Withers, its great"
1,Another missing song,"Besides missing Use Me by Bill Withers (which is an integral part of the film and omission is unforgivable), both soundtrack CDs are also missing Coyote Dance by Little Wolf.It is the Native American song that is played a couple of times when the players are moving/lining up on the field. I have it on a Native American compilation CD entitled Songs of the Spirit and recognized it immediately."
2,The Moby instrumental,"The one everyone is after is not 'Everloving', it's No. 18 on Moby's Play Album, 'My Weakness'. I'm listening to it now."
3,Fancy Branch Fringe,"The pieces in ths book are gorgeous and frothy, but not anything I'm likely to wear. Her 'Coraling Technique' is really just branch fringing taken to extremes; quite beautiful extremes.It's a nice book (45 pages) to have in my beading library but I wish I'd spent my money on something more diverse."
3,"Pretty necklaces and clear instructions, but expensive and thin on content","'The book describes how to make the jewelry shown under ""See larger image and other views"" - no more and no less. So you know exactly what you get. The instructions are very good, with large and clear diagrams. There are also helpful hints for beginners. I am a beginner myself and had no difficulties making a necklace.I thought the necklaces very pretty and am happy with my purchase. On the downside, it is a very expensive book considering the content. It's really more a magazine than a book, with only 44 pages. All necklaces are variations of one and the same theme.So if you really want to learn coraling technique and need detailed instructions, go ahead and buy the book. But if you are a beginner who is generally interested in off-loom bead weaving, I recommend ""The Art of Beaded Beads"" by Jean Campbell instead. It is much more varied, and much better value for money."
2,Expensive,"Same two techniques used repeatedly in the same way throughout the book: Right-angle weave and ""Coraling Technique"" (actually branch fringing), both can be easily found on internet. The 10 projects are all the same with some alterations (which are presented as ""different"" projects). In my opinion there was no need to publish a whole book (more accurately a 45 pages booklet with large pictures-good for visual learner- but for obvious reason to fill the pages) on just two techniques at such price.I could give the book 3 star, but the price bothers me since you can find a lot of books with many different projects at the same price."
5,great Book,I knew this technique would be difficult going in. It is made easier by the step by step directions in this book. I recommend it if you are anxious to learn a new technique. There are many different projects. I will be only making one of them . . .the others do not appeal tome.
4,Third Year of Hartwell,"Reading through the series backwards, I have reached the third volume of David Hartwell's annual anthology of science fiction stories. It contains 22 stories, each with an introduction to the story's author and the author's other works.My four favorite stories are listed below.In Jack Williamson's ""The Firefly Tree"" an unusual alien species makes contact with a young boy who accepts and understands them. We should all be so accepting.John Wright's ""Guest Law"" introduces us to a far-flung, star-traveling civilization where infrequent meetings between starships are governed by complex codes of hospitality.Terry Bisson's ""An Office Romance"" documents a romance between two technically sophisticated virtual office workers.Kim Newman's ""Great Western"" retells a familiar tale of a hero with a checkered past who rides into town just in time for a fight.The collection is recommended to all SF fans."
1,Paintball goods,"We ordered 2 spyder sonic paintball guns and body protection and paid for these, including shipping, by paypal. About a week later the body protection arrived with a receipt claiming that the order was completed and the amount we had paid now miraculously covered just these items and their shipping. Three weeks later we received an email stating that our separate order for the guns had been cancelled as we had not paid for these items and an even larger shipping cost. Funnily enough, although we have now contacted Amazon customer services about this twice they have not bothered to reply to us at all - scam or what!"
4,Dissappointed if comparing to XL Steeler Superbowl DVD,"As someone said above, the clip above is not on the Blue Ray in regards to the explanation. On blue ray, they just show run back and that's it.Had to listen to it in Stereo because 5.1 surround on the PS3 kept cutting the volume to a super low level every time commentator spoke. Very annoying. Not sure if it's this Blue Rays 5.1 or the way my PS3 interprets it. I do have MLB world series Blue ray, and that plays perfectly fine in 5.1. Shrug.Good video for Steeler fans to own, but as I said in title, does not compare to their previous Superbowl DVD XL in terms of emotion and pride. This Blue Ray just tells the story in a boring style manner, not much work seemed to go into it as previous one, so it seemed.After watching it and knowing it's downfalls, yes I still would buy it for my Steeler collection."
5,I Found the Ending Very Predictable,NFL Films always does a nice job. But there was no mystery. I knew who was going to win before I even bought the DVD.
3,Having only brief highlights was a disappointment,"Given this really is for Steelers fans, having only highlights of the season was OK, but having only highlights of the Superbowl was a bit of a let-down. Even the final drive was cut to ribbons.Nice production but I felt cheated.Like most though I will purchase the full game if it ever gets released."
5,Better than the entire game...,"To those of you who are angry that this doesn't include the entire game: Please settle down.NFL Films releases a season highlight DVD for the Super Bowl champ every year. And that is followed with the complete playoff and Super Bowl games in their entirety as a separate offering.This is, in my opinion, better than simply a replay of the game. (The NFL Network aired the full game about 50 times in the week following the Super Bowl.) This includes field and locker room access that only NFL Films can provide. Like the Super Bowl XL DVD, this is an incredible highlight reel of an amazing season and a must-have for any true Steelers fan."
2,Disappointed Steeler Fan,I purchased this DVD for my son because he was unable to watch the Super Bowl this year with his Steelers playing in it. We both thought the entire Super Bowl XLIII would be included on this DVD. He was very disappointed after watching this and so was I. This DVD is okay with all the highlights but that is just not the same as watching the entire game.
2,1 hour game-by-game season-review ripoff,"This DVD is your typical 1-hour full-season review that is shown over and over on CNN, NFL-Net etc during football season. It's packaged as a ""Super Bowl"" DVD but it's not. The dvd package itself says that it's 2 hours-- but that's 1 hour of a full-season review, and 1 hour of various interviews and features.This was almost a waste of money, now that they've finally coughed up the ""real full-meal deal"" dvd with the complete Superbowl game and other features.I rated it as a ""2"" because of the poor dvd content, not because of the 5-star game itself!"
2,Super Bowl DVD it is NOT,"I recently purchased the past super bowls on DVD and they were of very poor quality but the super bowl in it's entirety was on the DVD. This iswhat i thought i was buying here after seeing the advertisements for it.This DVD only shows 12 minutes of Super Bowl 43 ( starting at 55 min into the disc ) and i feel i have been cheated yet again by Warner Bros. If i may mention Super Bowl 9 from my other set they are selling on DVD. They advertised it to be the complete unedited original television broadcast and you open the DVD after you sent them your money and BAMMN and big disclaimer stating some plays may be missing.Misleading people to take their money is theft. They mentioned the technology back in super bowl 9 didn't permit them to make a quality product, yet i have Movies on DVD from before that time period and theylook allot better . Super Bowl 9 Looked like a bootleg VHS copy that had been copied over and over again.Anyways mislead/ripped off again !!!!"
4,Great but disappointed,"Love the product but was sad that the whole game isn't on this CD. Would love to find the whole game, but will have to wait and keep looking."
5,Great highlights of a great season,"Why are people getting this mixed up for an uncut dvd of the entire Super Bowl. If you just checked the item description it says that the dvd is 90 minutes. Super Bowls are not 90 minutes and common sense should tell you that this is a Super Bowl highlight dvd as well as highlights of a Super season. If you are looking for the entire uncut dvd of the playoffs and the Super Bowl, well that will be out later in the year. This dvd here is good for what it contains and it will be enjoyed by all those in Steeler Nation."
2,Disappointed,I expected this to be a DVD of the 2008 Superbowl not just the highlights. The way it is advertised and promoted it is very misleading. And the highlights of the Superbowl don't do the game justice!
2,Super bowl 43,Very disappointed; it was not the complete game. It contains highlights of all the games leading up to this super bowl game and the outstanding highlights of Super Bowl XL111.
4,Mostly a highlight reel,"I mistakenly bought this DVD thinking it was the actual Superbowl, but found that it is really only a highlight real from the season. Not really blaming the seller per se, but I would suggest making it very clear IN ALL CAPS that it is not the actual game. I gave it 4 stars because the quality is fine for what it is."
4,Good year in review,"This was a good year in review that brought out the emotion of the season, but it left me somehow wanting more... :)"
3,Super Bowl XLIII,"I wanted mostly the whole game, .... it's good, cause it's a review of the team during the year 2008, but would have prefered the whole game, i mean the Super Bowl XLIII game...."
3,Apparently not compiled by someone who followed the Steelers season,"While I love anything to do with the Steelers coming out on DVD (OK, maybe not the oft-delayed ""Steelers: The Mark Malone Years""), this disc just doesn't measure up to the 2005-2006 disc in terms of drama. The entire 16 game season is covered in a half an hour, with remarkable comebacks and potentially devastating injuries (Ben dying on field in the Cleveland game, for instance) glossed over in order to quickly get to the playoffs and Super Bowl. It looks and sounds fantastic (especially the Blu-ray, which also has the 4th quarter of the Dallas game), but it really does seem like Dwight ""Hands Of"" Stone was given this to edit together (a lot of no-brainers left on the cutting-room floor). As many others have said, the 4-game Road To XLIII comes out June 2nd, featuring the 13-9 Baltimore nail biter along with the 3 playoff games, so for those of you saying, ""Yinz guyz jipped me,"" I hope you have a spare $40-$50 ready for that."
1,Deception on DVD,"This is one of THE worst productions of only the highlights of one of the most exciting seasons ever played, and for sure one incredible superbowl. The producers should hang their heads in shame.,..even the pictures are off color...did you ever see a black and gold Steeler uniform in raging blue ? I would have given it 0 stars but amaze-on insists on 1 minimum rating.So where are the real DVD's NFL...we'd like to see the WHOLE GAME !"
3,Good but not my favourite...,"this recording is good....but i only find the spring concerto on top form in this album...I actually like the summer finale....and the winter finale.... but I found the album sounded very mucky at times...the first movement of winter...my favourite piece in the world was very very dissappointing...not enough life and passion in it. And on another note the four seasons sound best in modern pitch...as in vivaldi's time, northern italy had a pitch closer to today's than the lower pitch of ther rest of europe....the key is very importatnt in depicting moods and this recording was made when most people thought all of europe had a lower pitch. Out of the authentic instrument recordings that i have my favourite is the nils-erik sparf (which is however in the lower pitch) the others being this one and the one by il giardino armonico. However in his other vivaldi recordings especially of L'estro armonico biondi is stunning...."
5,Perfect,What's better the a margarita? Having it served in a beautiful glass. These glasses are beautiful and perfect for entertaining. Can't go wrong at this price!
1,Not 13 ounce,"These are 8 oz glasses, not 13 ounce as listed in Amazon's product description. They are good quality, but clearly not as advertised."
4,great buy!!,These are a great buy for the price. The are a decent weight so you don't feel like you will break them. They hold quite a bit so you are not filling your glass constantly and work great with my Rimmer. I would order them again and again.
5,Margaritaville Mates,"Happy with these glasses. show no signs of etching in the dishwasher after 3 washes, and 4 of them fit on one side of the dishwasher nicely. Great value."
5,"Lovely, warm scarf","I gave this as a Christmas gift. It is beautiful - the color is rich and striking, the knit is warm, and it is a great size."
2,Fun to read but too many errors,"This juvenile book about California's history in the 1800s is actually enjoyable to read even though more fiction than history. What ruins things is the repeated errors. William B. Ide named in some places inexplicably becomes ""George Ide."" June 15, 1846 is given as fact as the date of creation of the ""Bear Flag,"" when all we know for certain is that it was made between Sunrise,June 14 and noon of June 17, 1846. The author speculates about a Californian ""Betsy Ross"" but there is no evidence any one like that was involved in the making of the Bear Flag.The style of the book, being from the mid-1960s, is dated, but that is expectable. Given that there are so few quality children's texts about the Bear Flag Revolt and Conquest of California, this book missed an opportunity to fill that gap. It's really too bad, given the quality of the writing.William J. TrinkleDirectorTHE BEAR FLAG MUSEUM"
2,Disappointing,"I expected more. The door does not shut correctly. There is no audible alarm that the oven is preheated. Overall, it is kind of clunky in use. Pretty though, for what that's worth."
3,Couldnt Do It,"This game is as good as it gets for someone who loves the D&D world. Character creation was deep enough and the dungeons were good. Problem as said before is forced grouping. After advancing to level 2 solo play is nearly impossible at least for casters which i simply must play. I dont mind grouping, when i feel like grouping but the main problem lies in the fact that you do not really have time to make enough friends before you have to start grouping. Being totally fried on WOW i gave this game several hours and just cannot bring myself to pay for hanging around waiting to group with people who may or may not be fun to be around. Hopefully they will try again and do the D&D world with enough solo quests throughout to keep everyone playing. I would love to see it."
2,I really Really wanted to like this game,"I sounded like the perfect blend of the Challange of an RPG and the Online Community of a Massive Roleplayer. Unfortunatly from a Roleplayers point of view it's just another massive multiplayer repeating the same quests over and over, grinding, farming, ect. ect. The only thing is it does have a nice D&D ""Feel"" about it with all the newly trademarked monsters, it's also got solid graphics and such but in reality it's not close to an RPG and the tech support for paying a monthly subscription service is terrible."
3,its pretty true to dnd,really great for lovers of the pen and paper. just not enough dynamic content to be the same experience of the pen and paper fantasy.
2,could be better,"grouping is a pain. it takes forever to put a group together. I hope that the game gets better with more updates. It is fun, but needs work."
1,Nobody plays this anymore...it's dying out,"This came out 3 years ago. It used to be fun and had a lot of good things about it. HOWEVER, the player base has dwindled severely, servers have merged, the non-US servers WERE TAKEN DOWN PERMANANTLY RECENTLY.... basically all the people that used to play this have left to play other games. The ones that are left get smaller and smaller (and more and more annoying personalities). They'll probably close it all down soon.Shame. Was fun, but that was 1-2 years ago. It's got more than a foot in the MMORPG grave."
1,Buy with caution,J&R does not update their stock on this site. We purchased this over five days ago; said was in stock and avilable to purchase; just got an email from amazon stating J&R did not have this in stock.
1,"Avoid the expensive subscription, just download the Trial",Why pay Turbine when you can play for free and get the same (LAME) experience
1,Not as described!!!,"Says a variety of flavors, which is what I was expecting, instead I got 275 pieces of all regular. NOT AS STATED!!!"
1,No as Advertised,"Well I purchased this item to give away at trade shows my company attend. While I was expecting a bucket of 3 different flavors. I received a bucket of the original flavor. As I chatted with a rep from amazon.com, he basically told me that your out of luck."
2,Not the flavor of Bazooka you remember,"Obviously a recipe was changed. The original flavor you may remember from your childhood is no more. I bought a tub hoping for nostalgia...instead I got a so so gum. Bummer. If you are looking for the original flavor Bazooka, there is a supplier of Kosher Bazooka Gum. Jokes are in Hebrew...but it is delicious."
3,"Too expensive, but my grandchild wanted it.",I would not have spent this much on bubblegum if it had not been for the fact that my grandchild had to have Bazooka. I guess that how you catch us.
5,"Innovative and Fascinating A must Read for Wiccans, Pagans","This is an interesting book, it can be used as a Book of Shadows, or used as reference on Dark wicca and how to contact Gatekeeper Deities...Konstantinos has developed a system of wicca that works best for him and his use of magick and, Those who work best with Nocturnal energies will be content this work...This book is great for Beginners and Informative for the Seasoned wiccan...NeferEmPet Sat Aset, Meryt Imhotep.Wiccan Priestess and Universal Pagan"
5,a must get book to add to your collection,"this book caught my attention when i was looking thru the wiica books online.i read about it.ANd i was like ""this is the book for me""!!This is a book for people that dont want to spend a great amount of money on your stuff that youir need.it talks about how to build a nocturnal alter that is sooo easy to make.mind reading is easy too.well it is a great book)0(blessed be"
2,Mediocre Rehash Of Basic Wiccan Principles,"This is book has negligible value. The only thing in it that's at all different from every other book on basic Wicca is the part about mind-reading.The main problem with this book is the witer's claim that ""dark is not evil"" is an original premise. One of the main things about Witchcraft is the balance of dark and light, night and day!To anyone who is at all familiar with the Wheel Of The Year, the Dark and the Light are celebrated equally!The only thing of any interest are his mind-reading techniques. That would be interesting to try and see of they work!Other than that the book is valueless. Don't waste your money!But in all fairness, I don't think his target audience is 46 year-old womyn! Perhaps young men might enjoy this book."
1,not worth buying,"Too much hype, little content. Most of wich being info you can find in just about paganism 101 book. As for the 'dark' aspect of it, its little more than changing to a few darker colors and worker with a few darker gods. You want info on the darker apsects of paganism, go check outShadow Magick Compendium: Exploring Darker Aspects of Magickal Spirituality"
4,Pretty Good!,"This book is another good one from Konstantinos. Most of his books are pretty good, this one included.You should deffinatly get it. It helped me, a long time practicer of magick, a lot. Even more impressive is that despite my strictly anti-goodie-goodie-earth-religion views, I still got great use out of it.I was severly dissapointed, though, with the mind reading section. That didn't turn out to be anything really grand."
1,Fluffy Bunny,"This book is for the Goth Fluffy Bunny. If you are into the White-lighter, Fluffy Bunny, New Age,Goth then this is the book for you! Everyone else will want to keep looking, I wish I did."
5,Great,This is one of my favorite books. Because it doesnt refer to the darkness as evil. This is a must have for all night lovers.
4,Fresh Perspective on Dark Witchcraft,"I love the material in Konstantinos Nocturnal Witchcraft he touche on subjects that other witchcraft books will not even go there. I like finding out that I am a good dark soul. He has helped me to recongnize why so many people come to me for help in dealing with evil dark souls. I have always been more interested in the darker aspects of witchcraft and the Crone aspect of the Goddess. This book is a must have for those out there that are just not getting the information they need or want with traditional witchcraft books. This is a first on dark magick and the ""good side"" of it. I recommend this book for a beginner or advanced practioner as it has techniques I have never read about and i have studied magick for 4 years. For anyone interested in finding out the 4 different soul types and why you may be drawn to the darker energies of witchcraft i recommend this book. Even if you don't agree with all his methods this is a must have referrence. Thanks Deb"
4,Good Foundation,This book really helps to lay a solid foundation for NocturnalWitchcraft and Occultism. It is a wonderful book for anyone whois more attuned to the Nocturnal cycles and the powers that arereadily available in the dark of night.You will not find a great deal of in depth information here buthe did a wonderful job of helping me to sort out my thoughtsand approach to the subject.I have a few of his books and intend to purchase the rest.
1,A Gothic Silver RavenWolf,"This book is a laugh and not much else. This guy is the uberpale, black-eyeliner-wearing, black-hair-dying version of Silver RavenWolf: cheesy, full of himself and completely useless.Aside from that, the idea of nocturnal witchcraft is highly impractical. Yes, a lot of us are night people and work better at night. But this guy is practically suggesting a WORSHIP of the night, like some sort of Wiccan vampire or something.Don't waste your money or time on this book. You have better things to do at night, like REAL witchcraft, or even sleep!"
4,Harlem,"This book Harlem, by Walter Dean Myers is a fabulous picture book. It is full of culture and we really recommend this book. Four out of five stars is what we rate this book.This book helps with inferencing because words have different meanings. ""We hope, we play"", could be about rights. Harlem is very informational. It's about many different things like the experience of being in a band. The poems and pictures are creative. There are worlds, rhythms, and colorful pictures.If you haven't read Harlem, you're missing out! It's informational and creative in it's own way. Walter Dean Myers puts feeling in his poems. They are truly inspirational.By: Emma and Talia T."
1,your coffee carafe would do a better job...,this is a worthless item--it is truly thinner than my krups coffee carafe and the markings are harder to read than that as well. this item will NOT hold up to daily use and i will feel lucky if it doesn't break in my hand and cut me to ribbons. save your money and/or pressure pyrex to make a 6-cup size!
4,Decent,"I bought the book as a gift for a friend. It arrived in good condition, although it took a little while to get here. It appears to be amusing for those who like Star Trek."
2,They broke like 2 weeks with almost no use. Internal parts where not ok,I purchase this hoping to habe some nice grip tweezer holdet tool but they just dont work as i hope to
4,Old-Fashioned but Sweet,"This collection of stories was enjoyable to read, if a bit old-fashioned. Each story is short and can stand alone (though there are a few that are inter-connected), and all extol the virtues a girl of the Victorian era or so was expected to display: charity, loyalty, honesty, modesty, etc. At times almost painfully old-fashioned in some of the views on a woman's place in the world, the stories range from being stories of friendship in the ""modern"" era to tales of women in the past, most interesting enough to keep me reading.Overall I thought that this collection was a fun insight into society of the past, though I'll admit that this aspect of the book intrigued me more than the stories themselves. If you're looking to see what girls were taught and what virtues society expected from them, this is fantastic place to find examples. The stories themselves are fun to read, though not ""great literature"". I enjoyed reading it."
4,"Lots of pluses, but some minuses","Bought a used Maclaren Elite (they are a bit expensive) for my small 7 yr old grand daughter who has CP and does not walk. Convenient, light weight and easy to handle. Don't like having to remove foot rest each time and it could get lost. My biggest minus is child keeps edging down in stroller and must be pushed/pulled up often since there is no ""pummel"" for between legs to keep child in place. Harness does not keep child positioned. Would be a great item to offer as a ""add-on"" for those in need, even some plastic item that could be tied on to the seat when opened."
3,Overpriced,"This separator is OK but overpriced, it looked much bigger in picture than it actually is. Though it does work and removes the yolk fine. One issue is if you push the separator snap tight on the cup than it is hard to pull out specially when you have egg white in the cup pulling the separator out can cause spill. To overcome this i do not push the separator on cup tight i loosely put it on top. Have used it for one month so far. does its job fine but for such a small piece $15 is way too high."
5,Does what it says,"I like eating raw eggs yolks but don't eat the whites. This thing does the job perfectly. It's stainless steel, heavy duty, and the cup separates from the receptacle for easy cleaning."
4,it works fine,I wish the actual separator would hold more than one egg at a time. the base does hold 3 egg whites at a time.
5,Small but love it!!!,I purchased this to help me with my diet. I love how the cup will hold the egg whites for you and the seperator is made to grip the cup so well. Big thumbs up!!!
1,Ouch!,"Ok, this thing has one heck of a sharp edge on the receiving cup. Second egg, one cut finger. And it wasn't like I wasn't being careful. I've been a welder of steel since 1976. Cuts here and there by various metals and shavings, but to be an iron worker and be cut by a little egg separator? Don't tell my buddies. To add to the quality, or at least the efficiency of the product, well it's rather sloppy and a bit slow. Goops of egg white attach to the ""spoon"" and can't escape due to the way the cup is under the spoon. The cup sort of catches the egg white on it's side and holds onto it kinda like that bugger you just can't seem to flick off your finger. Maybe if the sharp (finger cutting) edge of the cup was curved inward into itself so I could use it as an edge, like the serated ones on box of a roll of plastic wrap."
1,Didn't separate real pastured eggs,"I haven't used eggs you buy in the stores for so long I guess I didn't realize that farm-fresh ones are just that--fresh. I had to return mine because my whites where so thick, they wouldnt separate from the yolk."
4,too small,"This magnet, though very strong, is too small to cover much ground. I wanted to use it where old lumber with nails had been burned in a pretty large pile. I should have paid more attention to the dimensions given for the product than I did to the pictures. It is difficult to remove small pieces of steel from the magnet because of how strong it is. I should have bought a larger magnet than this one. I feel sure that this magnet would work fine for uses other than mine."
5,Serves my purpose well,"I bought this magnet to mount on the under side of my motorcycle to trip the red lights. There are products on the market called ""Red Light Changers"" that are specifically made for motorcycles. They are nothing more than a powerful magnet and cost 3 to 4 times of what I paid for this one. This one has an eye loop in the center which can be unscrewed and the same hole can be used to bolt this to your motorcycle. It works! Whenever I approach a red light, the magnet sends a signal to the magnetic loop in the street and the light changes. I suppose it would work great as a retrieval magnet also, but that's not why I bought it."
4,As advertised,"A nice little uke I bought for my Grandson. Quick delivery, I am a satisfied customer."
1,ukulele was not strung too tight,"Sorry, but I sent this back. It was not up to the standard that I thought it was."
5,Excellent compilation,"This is an excellent compilation, with original hits by the original artists, like the song ""I Fought the Law"", by Bobby Fuller Four (later adapted by The Clash in 1977), plus a few originals by Duane Eddy (no re-recordings), and countless other artists from Johnny Cash to Buddy Holly, Little Richard, a rare unfinished demo of ""Claudette"" by Roy Orbison. We also find some standards by Jerry Lee Lewis. There are 4 CDs with 15 songs on each (they could have been much longer, however). A very enjoyable set."
2,disappointment,I'm sorry - but I was really disappointet ... there is only about 3 songs with Bobby McFerrin - This is not a Bobby McFerrin DVD. Some of the good songs he performed live on TV is not included on this DVD.
5,Great Album,"Anybody who reads these fan reviews must be a Nektar fan or you would not be looking for them here at Amazon.Get this new Cd by them. There is no reason to wait. In my opinion it is one of the best albums on 2004.There are three of the original four members playing on this album, the one missing is the great Mo Moore. A big loss indeed, but the new bass player is excellent. He even plays a Rickenbacker.There is not anything close to a weak song on this album, not that I expected it but is blew my mind on just how strong from start to finish that ""Evolution"" really is.The musicianship and lyrics are just top notch. One again we have a true ""concept"" album from this great band. Do your-self a favor and add this to your collection, you will not regret it."
3,Not so ready to fly!!,"Be advised, the included transmitter does not come with a charger or batteries. Order that lot seperately at an extra $25 or so from this site. Upon first try out it nose dived and the front end smashed apart quite severely making us retreat to the garage for massive glue fixing!"
3,the transmeter is a peace of junk,"The plane looks great but the transmitter is not very good. It has the throttle on the back of it, very uncomfortable to use. I swapped it out for a another unite I had. A normal transmitter would have been much better. That is the only thing that prevented it from getting a 5 star rating."
3,So-So,"While this installment was better than the last few, this is still a very silly series, especially in the romance department.There is no chemistry whatsoever between Helen and Phil, and their romantic scenes always seem forced...such as when Phil picks Helen up at work amid a throng of TV reporters and she starts trying to take off his clothes as soon as she gets in the car. I also find the dialogue to be very trite, which definitely detracts from the story."
4,"Excellent, Happy, Danceworthy!","Even if Latino or Salsa music isn't your normal fare, I think you will like this one. The melodies are hearbreakingly beautiful, the music is happy, and it's the total manifestation of what Gringos like me love about this type of music. I'm a beginner Salsa dancer and this can be quite challenging because it can move pretty fast--but it motivates you to attain the next level. I highly recommend it!"
4,Excellent portayal of Andrew Wyeth's concentration on a particular subject.,"Andrew Wyeth, in his series of sketches and paintings of this particular subject displays his amazing talent, and also, perhaps, a personal erotic obsession."
5,Beautiful and Practical,"Like all of our Schleich toys, this is beautifully crafted and is almost art in itself. It is so attractive that it is difficult even for small children to resist playing with it, which is fine because it is very durable. The boat lends itself to many play scenarios and as a historical piece it could be considered educational."
1,Design By Paul Sebastian For Women,"I didn't like this, I gave it away! I'm 21, and to me it smelled like something my grandma would wear! It doesn't smell bad, it's just not something I like... Try a small sample before you go and buy a set like this, if you like it, buy it, if not save your cash, I wish did."
1,Massacre of a Requiem,"That Requiem is a masterpiece. Luchesi does deserve to be discovered and recorded. Alas! the very same people who pioneer in that noble challenge condemn these ""new"" composers to oblivion by providing us with a recording so lame that I consider it an insult to any music lover to merely dare putting such a horror on the market. The orchestra is barely OK and the soloists passable. The choir however is the worst I ever heard. The amateur choir of the church around the corner does a much better job!Don't waste a penny on that disc! I wish I could give it a zero star!"
2,"Sensitive understanding of Thai culture, few concrete info.","I am thinking of moving to Thailand. This book gives a good, sensitive understanding of Thai culture. However, the author's bumper-sticker philosophical musing gets a bit tired after a while. Practical questions about living in Thailand, such as taxes, health insurance, banking/investment (which a lots of retirees may be interested in) are not discussed. There is a chapter about fear and procrastination, which reads like the National Enquirer self-help page. This book is not worth the price, so I returned it."
4,DANGER-THIS BOOK IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR MENTAL HEALTH!,"Having read, and re-read, this book a few times it should come with a 'surgeon general's warning'-BEWARE-READING THIS BOOK MAKE CAUSE YOU TO REEVALUATE YOUR LIFE-I know that sounds dramatic but the author is some who 'chucked it all' and moved to a foreign country. How many of us haven't had the same thought??? I have them daily!!;-)He mixes the spiritual, emotional, and practical in a concise, quick read.Mike, THANKS FOR THE INSPIRATION!"
2,"A nice small book, but lack of concrete information","This book is wonderful in the sense that few Westerners have such sensitivity and understanding of Thai culture. However, his repetitive scolding of the bad, unappreciative and whinny expatriates gets a little tiring. The winding bumper-sticker philosophical musing about life gets more and more irrelevant, if what you'd like to get is up-to-date practical information. The chapter on Money, for example, sounds like a self-improvement pop-psychology manual. Instead of answering questions on taxes concerning investment withdrawals, health insurance, etc., the readers are treated to lots of philosophy about life. Since the book is not worth its price, I returned it."
5,Replaced by the FH70 Hybrid Battery,"I was looking for this battery at Best Buy (which had a better price at the time of this review), only to find out that it has been discontinued. It has been replaced by theSony NPFH70 H Series Actiforce Hybrid InfoLithium Battery for most Sony Camcorders. The Sony package claims similar stats, but with an improved 10 MINUTE recharge time! I just ordered it from Amazon and will update this review after I have had time to test it. The only reason I am giving it 5 stars (at the time of the review) is because of the reduced price and (claimed) 10 minute recharge time. If it does what it says...it'll definately be worth the money!"
5,Great service,I ordered the battery with regular delivery and received it the next day. It was exactly what I was looking for.
3,Not much better than NP-FP70,"I bought this for my DCR-DVD403. The original battery was an NP-FP70 which might last for a good day of shooting and previewing video. The new and improved NP-FP71 battery claims to have 20 percent greater capacity than the OEM battery. My informal tests based on charging and use found this battery to be exactly the same as the NP-FP70. The info lithium reads 135minutes capacity with a full charge. That is only a five minute improvement over the OEM battery. Not worth the extra cost. In fact the battery seems to run down quicker. Overall this is not worse than the NP-FP70, but certainly not a big improvement."
4,Battery Pack for Sony Camcorder,Got this as a replacement for the factory battery. Good idea to have two.This one works great. Had this same type for my last camcorder and wasvery happy. Great buy!
