1,Just awful ! Invest in a good supplemental book/study guide,"My gosh, I have never read such a poorly written book! Wasn't there an editor at Prentice Hall to have, at least, reviewed this book prior of it going out to print? The poor grammar usage, the garble & ambiguity of explaing the concepts; it truly lacks direction...where are the solutions to the problem exercises?I consider myself a strong avid reader, but I have found myself re-reading a page or two before pressing on.If this is a required textbook for your accounting class, I highly suggest investing in a good supplemental study guide to aid you with this book. Good luck!!"
4,Very Good Compared to Others,"Read this book for one of my MBA courses. Found it a good read. Coming from a Financial Management course I was leery about this course and its textbook, but the text helped me a lot."
2,Not for beginners.,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who has not have any prior Managerial Accounting classes or sufficient work experience in this area. The way the topics are presented in the book requires familiarity with a number of related concepts in order to gain full understanding. Additionally, there is a number of instances in which concepts are introduced in a given chapter, but not explained until a later one, which makes it really confusing for those exposed to Managerial Accounting for the first time."
1,Garbage,"Poor explanations, few examples and an overall horrible use of the English language to express concepts."
1,Simply Atrocious!,"This has to be the worst textbook ever! I'm quite suprised this textbook is still in use. No clear examples, poorly written and lacks any kind of real direction. This text is clearly not written for the typical MBA student. I highly recommend using a supplemental textbook that provides clear explanations. This book is good for one thing, a good sleep aid. You will be fatigued within the first few pages! Avoid this textbook at all costs!"
5,"A ""must have"" for your business library","My MBA program used this book. I found the book easy to read and liked its consideration of behavioral issues usually ignored in other books. The book covers new and important topics in management accounting (activity-based costing, balanced scorecard, JIT, target costing, kaizen costing, environmental costing and benchmarking). A companion book (Readings in Management Accounting) has lots of articles describing applications of material presented in the textbook."
5,Awesome seller,The book was not the one I needed and the seller was very diligent in aiding me with the situation.Thank you very much! Definitely will buy here again!
5,Just what I wanted,"I saved $20 or $30 dollars by buying the filter on the Internet and installing it myself. It took no tools and less than five minutes to replace it in my Nissan Rogue. The filter I ordered was the right one, it fit and it arrived promptly from Amazon. Now I'm inspired to do more car maintenance myself."
2,Buy something else!!,"Yes it is beautiful and a great price to have everything you need. BUT several pieces were damaged(not from shipping-they obviously don't inspect what they pack). I had a front drawer with a huge cut on it. When you try to put the drawers together, you can't align the grooves to get the bottom of the drawer in. Alot of the holes don't match up to screw the peices together. The changing table is an odd size and I have yet to find a changing pad to fit it. The standard 16X32 is too big. When my husband contacted the company to get replacement peices, they are making it more of a hassle than it's worth. Sending pictures, and more pictures of the damages, it is an everyday hassle that we won't give up on. Thank goodness we have at least another month before our baby gets here and hopefully it will all be taken care of by then. I still have a little hope. If I purchased this at a store I would have definately returned it by now."
3,Nothing extordinary,The Yeston/Kopit version is nothing special compared to the Lloyd-Webber version. Don't get this book.
5,really cool,"don't think that lightsabers are only for little kids. I'm 13 and i still have fun with these things. my friends and i still have lightsaber duels when we get together to watch the movies. even my dad will duel me, maybe I'm just a nerd. its very durable, so whoever is playing with it will have fun. i have a couple of lightsabers they hold together great even through the years. so if you're looking to get something for your four year old or your star wars nerd its a good buy. so enjoy your lightsaber they're great for people 3-53, enjoy."
2,Ok for the price..,"Bought this about a month ago, I play shows once or twice every week. For the price this is an OK overdrive. I would recommend spending the extra $30 and buying the big muff or buy the vacuum tube overdrive. This pedal sounds pretty muddy (not the good kind) and is almost impossible to get a good sound out of. I run it through the OS-2 and a noise gate and now it sounds pretty good but on its own it's not great."
2,Not That Great as expected,I expected a lot from this movie but failed to enjoy the movie. The hero and heroine did very well but the over all x rated one is not our expectation. I bet most of the people expected a lot more but in vain.
1,Really Bogus,Fake studio scenes with vulgar language and beginner modelling type people who seem to purposely speak Hindi with an affected French-Canadian accent. Even the facial expressions and background music sounds remind us of techno clubs. The story is rather poor with more emphasis on prostitution and rape rather than true love-making secrets prescribed in the original Kama Sutra. Don't get it for the name -- it has no connection whatsoever to Kama Sutra. The casts are far from sexy -- maybe rich and ugly enough to woo Mira Nair to give them a role. They hired Rekha (from Utsav) but that boring mama simply fails to uplift the mood of the movie. Mira Nair did a lousy job using a camera with a heavy reddish yellow lens when this movie could never even qualify to be a timeless collection.
2,kama sutra A tale of Love,Unable to play this dvd on my dvd player because it is for a different zone to european. I have bought other dvds since then but still cannot find any indication of what zone the dvds are in. Normally they are ok.
2,Visually stunning but not much more,"I could watch this movie over and over again if I turned the sound off. Though some of the love scenes are a bit cliche for my taste, the director does a great job of bringing out the beauty of these women and the beautiful setting in which this movie takes place. The script is somewhat insipid, and the story could use some creativity. If your looking for a mediocre love story you don't really have to think about, this movie is for you. if your looking for something with a little more quality, i'd pass."
5,The Only Thing,"The only thing missing from this movie, was the smell of India. The movie is great in cinematography. The colors, sounds, people, place are exotic and beautiful. This is not a bollywood movie, thankfully."
4,Good Education For Sharing The Dark and Bright Side Of Love,"Everyone needs to be educated in developing the awareness to make good choices in their lives.Love is the greatest healer of all. Yet, we all need to be mindful of the path we choose.This film shows the pitfalls and valleys of this process of cause and the effect of choices people make, and how so very quickly it can affect the rest of your life all depended on the choice you make or don't make!!!Yet, it is never too late to choose to be true to yourself, what it means to truly and deeply love yourself and others!!!May we all choose to love and find it where ever we can, be it in nature or with dear friends and our community that we live in!!!"
4,Tapestry come to life,"Visually entrancing, spectacular colors, exotic scenery. The nudity is so closely woven into the narrative that it does not even appear erotic, just natural. For all it's splendor, the movie lacked that kick-in-the-gut level of denouement that I look for in a truly great movie, or it would have been a five.If you are looking for a movie on sexual positions, this is not for you, but if you are ""open-minded"" you will be rewarded in other ways. :)"
4,I liked this movie...a lot!,"This movie is visually beautiful and the cast is hot!! Especially Ramon Tikaram! What a star! He took my breath away. Of course, there are a couple of moments in the movie when you are like, ""puh-leese"", but overall, the movie is good, and the story keeps you interested. Mira Nair is a talented director. I can't wait to see what she comes up with next. I think that some people may have expected too much and they got disappointed, but there's no denying that this movie is a feast for the eyes, as well as your heart."
5,One of the best foreign film you could see,Kama Sutra was a movie i had just picked off the self at blockbuster to watch and i was very happy i had gotten it. it truly is a tale of love!
5,STUNNING!,"THIS MOVIE IS SO BRILLIANTLY BEAUTIFUL. IT'S LIKE A FAIRY TALE. THE ACTING IS SUPERB AND THE STORY IS CLASSIC...AND THE BREATHTAKING CINEMATOGRAPHY ALONE IS ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS MOVIE A MUST-SEE. YOU WILL BE TRANSPORTED INTO ANOTHER WORLD, ANOTHER TIME; IT'S AMAZING."
1,Don't even bother to see it. Its not even worth 1 star.,"The makers of the movie tried to encash the name KAMA SUTRA. The way the movie is made is so childish, and the picturization of the Indian settings is sickening. Its not even close to the reality. If you are looking for some love lessons, don't even think of watching this movie. Instead of turnig on, the movie, acutally turns you off. My sincere advise, don't even think of wasting your money on this movie."
1,Not what you think,"This movie was a very big disappointment. The acting was terrible. The plot so easy to figure out. It was not as sexy, or seductive as you'd think it would be. The sex scenes were not steamy and you certainly didn't learn anything new."
3,Memorable,I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but bought it as it was recommended to me by Amazon. It's the story is definately memorable - staying with me weeks after I watched it.
2,"Some nice scenes, but overall quite crude","This is a rather crudely made film devoid of much charm. A few of the scenes are nicely shot, but overall this is a letdown, just like almost every film with the words ""Kama Sutra"" in the title. Beware of overly positive reviews. I'm not Indian (nor Pakistani), unlike some highly biased reviewers here."
5,Karma,"I love this movie. One of the best! Action packed from beginning to end. Makes you laugh, cry, and in shock of events."
4,"great setting, excellent music, other view of lovestories","Found the lovestory spiced with oriental misticism, the contact with the society and codes of the time transport me in time and ambience not very common. Music gives a lot of magic to the story. END"
4,Nice movie,I liked the movie. The story is interesting and the actors are good. The attitude of maya was inspiring. Enjoyed it!
4,"A historic, erotic love story.","I found this movie to be very interesting. I absolutely loved the costumes! That designer deserves an Oscar! This film lets us see the Indian culture from the past, and they're many ways of seduction. I say we Americans can learn a few ""moves"" from their culture. Where can I sign up for a Kama Sutra class???!"
5,Incredible movie,"This is one of the most outstanding movies I have ever seen. Maybe it is a woman's movie, but I feel it captures the very essense of sexuality and true love. Incredible set designs and casting. A movie I have watched over and over again. What a disappointment if you miss this one."
2,If you like Bollywood movies.....,"I'm not a big fan of Bollywood movies.... I've seen only a couple that I could stand. This movie to me felt like an attempt to create an Indian style melodrama that deals frankly with sex as a tool for feminine empowerment. Mira Nair's intentions are good (she arranged women only screenings in India), but she winds up with a nicely photographed Bollywood movie with sex scenes replacing the musical numbers. Is this a bad thing? It just depends on how much that style of melodrama appeals to you. It doesn't work for me much, but I can go for the sex instead of musical numbers, though. It reminds me of some Bollywood movies (not to mention Hollywood movies) that deal with serious subjects by simplifying it and stripping the issues of it's depth so that it can be easily consumed by the masses."
4,Slow to start but worth the wait,This movie was a little slow in the beginning and a little longish...However the movie itself was beautiful and the actors were feverishly hot! A sad ending that I wished hadn't happened.....
4,"Outstanding cinematography, beautiful costumes and actors","The film gave a vividly bright and colorful portrayal of 16th century India. The beautiful actresses and sets were very appealing, while the story could have been broadened. Casting could have been better. Sarita Chowdhury and Indira Varma are two very beautiful women. I sure dis appreciate this vision into Indian culture and life."
2,Doesn't stand up to repeated viewings,"The colors on this DVD are washed out. On the big screen they were sumptious and epic but something has been lost in the transfer, as if they used a bad print or didn't spend the money to guarantee a worthy digitizing. That said, the movie itself was very good on its first viewing and less interesting with later viewings, because it wants to be epic but in truth illuminates very little about love and sacrifice. What would save it is how wonderful looking it is, but like I said -- the colors don't stand out on the DVD, which is a sad loss."
5,Incredible romance,"I have always loved this movie, and was very excited to realize that one of my favorite actors, Naveen Andrews, is in it, too! Lush, opulent settings and epic plot combine to make a great movie."
2,Crossed up Cultures,"This movie in my opinion is much more in sympathy with hollywood than the culture it claims to portray. Even if there is voracity to its plots, this kind of sludge from the past is better left forgotten."
4,Very intriguing movie!,"I liked this movie a lot! Very interesting with many ups and downs! Reminded me of Dangerous Beauty, but very different too."
4,A tale of love woven with true eroticism,"I found this movie to be highly erotic, but not cheaply so. It ventures into sex without falling into the trap of pornography, while still remaining entertaining and arousing; it deals with the classical elements of love: romance, intrigue, friendship and betrayal, loss and fulfillment. It is an affirmation of the sexual psyche and a sensual feast! Mira Nair is to be applauded! I also highly enjoyed her other feature film, ""Mississippi Masala"", and I recommend it as well."
3,lavishly beautiful eye candy; fabrics and costumes glorious,"An aesthetically pleasing film, Kama Sutra offers up the feeling of old India, displaying the lush color and texture of fabrics exquisite in their beauty. Music is lovely. Film important for giving overall look and feel of the area in 16th century India, Rajastan I believe. Plot is simple, but young actors make the entire experience a feast for the eyes. It is a sensually pleasing experience to watch Kama Sutra; this is true of all Mira Nair's work. Light, lovely, luscious -- see the film. Do not expect greatness, but enjoy the delights of the color, the music, the beautiful skin, hair, eyes and bodies of the actors. Scenes of intensely erotic lovemaking done tastefully."
4,The truth on the cycle of love and life...,"Man... where do you start. So many lessons to learn from this. Lessons on leadership, self expression, over indulgence, respect, abuse, and most notably love.I learned from the king's confidence, from the sculptures appreciation for beauty, from his fear of letting go to his feelings, from the deception of friends, so much more I just am having trouble expressing them so I will stop here and just say to watch this movie with an open heart and be willing to take from it."
2,Disappointing Audio Quality,"I purchased this album in MP3 download format to replace an old audio cassette that was well past its expiration date. It's the same great music I remembered, but the production quality of the MP3 files is just poor. The volume levels vary wildly from track to track. Going from ""Shepherd Of My Heart"" to ""Love In Any Language"" is a particularly jarring experience. The orchestral and choral bits on tracks like ""Let There Be Praise"" and ""Unshakeable Kingdom"" have an extremely flat/lifeless sound. Perhaps the studio masters had been damaged before they were able to digitize things, but it seems that a modest amount of time spent with some basic audio editing software would have been appropriate prior to offering this for sale in the new format."
5,Uplifting,"This is one of Sandi Patty's albums that always lifts my spirits. This album has many ""oldies but goodies"" that I will never get tired of listening to."
5,Excellent,"Had this on cassette, now ""old school"", and needed this to ""update"". Sandi has an incredible voice but, more importantly, an incredible message in her songs. Very uplifting and will truly touch your heart!"
3,dixie cup works just as well,I would recommend sticking with the tried and true using a small paper cup and freezing it and then peeling away the outer wrapper before use. This cup is fine as well but the block tends to break off and rarely comes out full and smooth like it is pictured Its fine...just not necessary for your cryotherapy
1,Great product but cracked,"Great product, and worked really well for me. Unfortunately, the plastic cup cracked open after only 3 weeks of use. If it hadn't cracked, would've given 5 stars"
1,Broke after 6 days,I was very excited about this 5 minute icing method but was extremely disappointed when the cup broke after just six days. Water expands when it cools below 4 degree centigrade and this led to it's cracking. They need to come up with a better design to compensate for that.
2,Really Like It; But Doesn't Last...,Bottom section cracks after a while. Would be an excellent product if they just thickened up the plastic a bit...
4,Bernanos - his life and works,"A perceptive, appreciative presentation of the life and works of Georges Bernanos. Bush notes, and I agree, that ""Everything is grace"" is a better translation of ""Tout est grce"" in Diary of a Country Priest than the translation in most editions."
5,Great book for the big Goddess or little Goddess,"I love this book, I have had it for many years and have incorporated it into my Goddess worship, its a lovely book dedicated to connecting with your inner Goddess. in fact I just bought a copy for my 13 year old, as I can't bear to part with mine. its a wonderful book also for helping those little Goddesses reclaim their magical birthright. I wish one was written for boy's, but I am sure I will be able to find books to help them also reclaim their magical birthright. my daughter will love this book as much I do."
5,Absolutely Loads of Fun !,"Now here's a book to have fun with! Angelica Danton has a fabulous method of finding your Goddess Sign by using the Chinese zodiac. She lists associations with Tarot, lunar phases and Numerology and describes the attributes of each Sign. Discover your own Goddess for 2005 in this immensely pleasing book. Just gorgeous !"
2,nothing special,"Great fun book, but don't get excited about too much insight. I've read more about my ""signs"" with astrology. She mixes the chinese calendar with the goddess types for your ""goddess sign."" Very mediocre."
5,was great when it was selling cheaper.. now not worth it,was great when it was selling cheaper.. now not worth itwas very useful to make a piece of clothing out of this.note: after a few months this will turn non transparent and will start to rot little by little. as will all natural rubber know that it will biodegrade
1,Quite possibly the worst WDW guide I have read,"Clearly the author cannot speak for her generation at all. Her reviews are biased and opinionated, and her tips offer little to no help for those unfamiliar with the Walt Disney World resort. She refers to Epcot's trademark attraction, Spaceship Earth, as a ""snooze,"" when I have seen plenty of teenagers who having nothing but good remarks to say about the ride.My advice: stick with ""Birnbaum's Official Guide."" It is suitable for WDW fans of ALL ages: from young children, through teens, honeymooners, and the elderly. It will offer you far better--and less opinionated--information."
2,Beware Studio 8 Owners,"I was excited to upgrade from Studio 8 to Studio 9, but in doing so, most of the original transitions that I had were now considered ""pro"" or ""pro plus"". I also find this program harder to use instead of easier. I tried to contact the Pinnacle people but never received a response. I don't understand how a company can take away something that I already had on a previous version. I plan on uninstalling 9 and reinstalling 8 to see if I can get all my original transitions back. Even my previous movies now have watermarks of ""Pro"" or ""Pro Plus"" on them! Another example of Company Greed! Don't waste your money."
1,"Not enough testing, released too soon","The STUDIO 9 upgrade is riddled with problems. I have had STUDIO 8 for some time and it worked fine so I upgraded to STUDIO 9 and the installation problems are a nightmare to start with (although I eventually got it installed), then there are the patches they put out which makes it almost impossible to add CD music to your video. You now have to rip CD music as .wav files and add them through the sound effects icon instead of the add CD feature which worked well with STUDIO 8.(...)Good Luck if you get the upgrade!!!! I would wait until the bugs are ironed out."
4,Studio 9 some bugs,We upgraded from Studio 8 to 9 ... we made over 20 DVDs with Studio 8...We have burned one DVD and one VCD with Studio 9. The only problem we have had with Studio 9 is that the video CDs will not play with the Windows Media 9 player in the computer. The Studio 8 VCDs play OK ... there is a bug in the Studio 9 VCD software and several users are having this same problem. Pinnacle does not want to acknowledgee that there is a problem. We are are waiting for the fix before we burn any more VCDs.
1,"Poor Support, Released too soon","Check out Pinnacle's customer support forum BEFORE buying this software. Tech support is saying ""we will be fixing the installation and ops problems in version 9.1.... but we have no idea when that will be released."" The other reviewers are right on. This is a company that knows how to sell, then sell extra ""features"", upgrade you like crazy (read: nickle and dime you), and then say ""oh too bad"" when their product fails miserably. Save your money. Buy something else."
1,Purchase of Studio 9 - NO WAY,"About six months ago, I purchased Studio 8 with a bonus of a FX add-on disk. The bonus disk was not readable. After hours of emails back and forth and several promises to replace that disk, I still haven't received satisfaction. I even got hold of a real person once who promised to send a replacement but like all previous promises, this one wasn't kept.If you want to buy dissatisfaction, Studio 9 is the product for you!"
1,Would be good if it worked!,"My review is for the full version 9, not the upgrade, but they should be the same. I had so many problems with version 8, but I made the mistake of hoping version 9 would be better. WRONG.The good: Pinnacle Studio is packed with features and is quite easy to use.The bad: It's JUNK. Full of bugs even with the latest updates. It's slow too. STAY AWAY from this product!"
4,Lil' Beethoven is a masterpiece *,"I'll keep it simple. This is the best album Sparks has done in over 20 years, easy. If you've ever loved this band-you gotta get it. The Mael bros. humor is in full effect here, and the music finds them reinventing themselves once again, but in a much more effective style. Vocals, musical performances, arrangements and production are top notch. Lyrics are brilliant and hilarious. 4 & 1/2 stars. Every song works. Favorites are ""How Do I Get To Carnegie Hall?"", ""Ride Em Cowboy"", ""Suburban Homeboy"" and ""Ugly Guys With Beautiful Girls"".Bravo Ron and Russell!"
5,"Roll over, Lil Beethoven","I love this album. I am a long-time Sparks fan and I enjoy how they have reinvented their style repeatedly while maintaining the Sparks foundation, and this album is no exception to this pattern. It is completely new and fresh yet as always is filled with interesting songs rife with humor and pathos. Nary a downside to be found - lots of Ron, lots of Russ. It really sounds cutting-edge; there appears to be a strong use of computer-based song editing which is really a part of the song structure - really interesting and enjoyable."
4,Imaginative and unlike anything I've ever heard,"I bought this cd about an hour before I saw Sparks perform in SF in April 2004. I listened to about half of it, then went into the show. They performed the whole album - and I HATED IT! When I got home I started listening to the CD more and more, and realized it was growing on me. It is excellent! While seemingly, and endlessly repetitive, it is quite imaginative. My favorite has to be YOUR CALL IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US - PLEASE HOLD. The repetitive nature of the song can be annoying, but isn't being endlessly on hold annoying?!? The album requires repeated listening in order to ""get it"". Once you do, you will LOVE IT!"
2,"I like it, but....",I like the songs that have the straight singing. When Russell speaks through things it sounds kind of.... dorky. Ron's lyrics are as great as always.
2,boring,I have to agree that this album is boring. Sentences are repeated endlessly. For the first song I thought it's a nice idea - like a cute intro - but then I have to say: I won't be listening much to this album that only consists of spoken sentences and the same melody loops.
5,Incredible!,"I gave up on Sparks in the early eighties but have hung on to Kimono My House and Propaganda as two of my all time favorite albums. Now, decades later, comes an album that equals the greatness of their early years. Here, they are pandering to no one and are just being themselves. The result is that Sparks are glorious once again: fun, zany, and even innovative. Amazing. The shame of it all is that Lil Beethoven, like Kimono My House and Propaganda, will go largely unheard."
4,Excellent resource for fellows and technicians,"This is an excellent and comprehensive introductory text in pediatric echocardiography.I missed the following sections:1) 2D imaging of coronary arteries, in particular with respect to Kawasaki disease.2) 2D imaging of pulmonary veins. There is, however, a very good section on Doppler examination of the pulmonary veins.The Snider/Serwer/Ritter remains an good resource. I am looking forward to a (hopefully) new edition."
4,Sound Finally Up To Par,"This was always my favorite Mission album. The only problem was the poor mastering that rendered the original CD so quiet (even by 1988 standards) that it was difficult to crank. The CD finally sounds decent with this remastered version. Personally, I wish the guitars had been mixed a bit louder, but it was 1988.The album itself flows beautifully from the opener Beyond The Pale, to the closing Hymn For America. There is certainly bombast and the ridiculous Led Zep rip-off Black Mountain Mist could've easily been left off. But as a whole, I thought this was the peak CD, their Joshua Tree of sorts. There was a genuine air of foreboding and danger that was never captured again."
3,Spazzy,"when this mouse works, it's GREAT. Ergonomic and tons of buttons.however, it gets knocked over VERY EASILY. 1 or 2 hits on the floor and it is not working properly ever again.buy with *caution*"
3,"Less pain, but quality issues","I have used both the original white model and the black version 3 for many year now and finally stopped using them and switched to Logitech without regret.Before I purchased these, I had a big problem with wrist pain, which would return quickly whenever I stopped using them.However over time the computer had more and more difficulty recognizing that I plugged the white one in and I nearly always had to use a mousepad. After 7 years, it got so bad that I just gave up. But then again 7 years is a long time for a mouse anyway.The black one is less than one year old and had a button that never worked from the start (but I did not mind as I never used that button), but it started acting up to the point that I was constantly telling the computer to do stuff that I did not want to do. Its replacementLogitech Wireless Performance Mouse MX for PC and Macis working perfectly."
3,Functionality without support,I received this mouse as part of a workstation accommodation effort at work. I had high hopes for it relieving some of the mouse stress that has contributed to my RSI. This mouse has an excellent set of drivers that allow for pretty much unlimited customization of the buttons. That is where my positive feedback ends.Once I had started using it daily I found that my thumb had to either grip the mouse tightly or rest on top of the mouse to keep my hand in place on the buttons. This caused the injury to my thumb to flair up and force me to stop using the mouse.
2,Rebooting problems,Is anyone else having issues with this mouse or even the wireless one causeing their computers to reboot? My system (PC\amd64x2 5000\asus mb\4gb ram\nvidia 9600 512mb\500gb HDD) seems to reboot at the slightest touch and there bios error message says soemthing about USB voltage overload. The mouse i the only thing new added to the machine before these erros started occuring. Just wondering if anyone else is having some of the same issues?\To review the mouse....I love it! Wrist pain gone and when I go to regualr mouse I can feel the difference and I long for this one. The buttons program awesomly and the feel of it is great to me. I am really hoping that it isn't causeing the reboot problems I am having but its really pointing to it =(
3,"Flimsy build for $50, not too ergonomic after long use","Initial impressions were quite impressive - extra programmable buttons, ergonomic design, etc. However, build quality is a little low for a $50 mouse. It is too light and the center of gravity too high, so I tend to rock it around when moving the mouse. Also the buttons have a cheap clicky feel to it compared to other mice and there is the annoying ""boing"" sound sometimes when I release the button at a certain angle. Ergonomic-wise I find it more taxing to use have my hand in the hand-shake position (perhaps I am too used to the old flat design?) and while initially it was usable, I found a lot of stress is my wrist after long usage. Place your palm flat on a table, and imitate clicking with your index finger. Now, do the same in a hand-shake position, which feels more comfortable? For me I had to exert a larger force and move a larger distance for the hand-shake position to activate the click, so it generated more pain for me after some use."
4,Pretty mighty up in dis humpty bumpty,"Takes a little while to get used to but overall it is very comfortable. Glides very smoothly on my desk.The drivers that come with it need some work. I wish I could use my intellimouse drivers. You can not assign all the function keys to the extra buttons, only F1 and F5."
4,Extremely comfortable,"I got this when working at a job that required I do a lot of work on the computer, and got this because I was beginning to get pain/discomfort in my mouse hand. This fixed the problem. Very comfortable.To reposition, you just tilt it to the right and reposition it -- you can't lift the mouse due to weight and fact that your fingers would grip on the buttons.Learning curve, but worth it if you have any discomfort. Not great for first person shooter games, but you can passably play them and it works fine for all other uses (and games)."
3,"Repeating, ever repeating......",Repetitious and ultimately boring (perhpas just like the royal family itself).Press interviews with the press.Very few words from the royals themselves.Same film footage shown over and over again.
5,The Royals,"Wonderful DVD set of the Royals. This set gives you the low-down, the dirt, but is well done. Wonderful footage and interviews by some valid sources. Worth every penny!"
2,Disappointing,"This book combines a (very) concise biography with several critical essays. The biography was a decent rough sketch of Austen's life and writing compressed into about 30 minutes worth of reading.The included summaries of Austen's works were hasty and thus vastly oversimplified, to the point of uselessness. They contain several minor errors as well, stupid things that the editor should have caught. Anyone new to Austen could get a better overview reading middle school book reports.The critiques are at least thought provoking although not exactly to my taste; the one by Brian Wilkie in particular was a magnificent piece of specious sophistry.If someone needs a quick source for a paper due the next day, the material in this book might be sufficient to make a C, but reading the real thing would be much more satisfying."
5,Great Gift,"I bought this necklace as a gift for my granddaughter, who is very into Cheer leading. She loved it and wears it all the time."
1,Pass on this pond filter,Sunterra products appear to be worthwhile and good value - but - as usual you get what you pay for. Unit does not come with ultra violet filtration and is cheaply made. Most significant flaw is that unit Leaks even after replacing O ring. Seal is not adequate for unit pressure. Locking mechanism does not do the job. Spent an entire afternoon changing over from a smaller system that worked perfectly to the larger system that leaks significantly to the extent that it was finally disconnected and original system reinstalled. The 300306 is a waste of money and time and Amazon would do well to discontinue this inferior line.
3,Steel-toe Boots,"So these boots arrived ahead of schedule-yay! But then we discovered they were steel-toed, and were sad. Boo! Also, there was a defect in the leather on one of the boots. We are returning them because they are too large, and steel-toed."
5,Great quality,Love my new Doc Martins. It will take a while to break them in but with any quality boot that is normal. Leather is a bit stiffer than I remember from my previous boots but some mink oil will soften the leather up nicely. The soles of the boots are THICK. These will last me a long time. Very happy with my purchase.
3,Not the same...at all,"Super cute boots, as always, but the quality of the now Chinese-made boots has plummeted. Leather is so stiff, stitching is uneven, the sole is cut along the sides slightly uneven, the inner heel pad was coming unstitched the first day I wore them. They are now making them quantity over quality. The $120 boots probably cost $4 or less to make. These boots should be sold for $60. I don't see them lasting years the way they used to. Very disappointed to have to treat my docs with such gentle care. Oh, the irony."
3,frowny face,"Sent them back for an exchange. they squeaked alot and I took them to a cobbler. they said that the steel toe didn't get glued in place, and they couldn't fix it. So I sent them back got another pair.....they still Squeak. frowny face."
1,Not what I was expecting.,"I bought this wanting a good cardio dance workout, it fell short. This DVD has it's good points and its bad points, more bad than good unfortunately.First the good:- good instructor, happy/perky but not annoying. Her cueing is pretty easy to follow and she doesn't surprise you with changing direction without notice.- tries to get your whole body with hip pops, lots of arm movements.Now the bad:- really strange music, not the kind that makes you want to dance.- the modified version isn't really modified, and they hardly show her, instead they focus on another woman just about as much as they focus on the instructor. (there are 3 women + instructor).- Several of the moves were difficult on carpet (funky feet, scissors).- Some of the movements hard to follow.Not a strenuous cardio routine, maybe good for an off day."
5,very good,"The dvd was great. I am not one to go to the gym and take classes b/c I dont feel comfortable working out in front of people, more or less dancing. I liked it. Im not a good dancer so it was easy for follow and have fun shakin' my butt. My 5yr daughter and I have fun doing it together. We always have a good laugh and feel great afterward. I have even noticed my body change and I lost a few inches off my waistline. I hope they do more dance videos that are this easy to follow and keep my daughter and I motivated to stay in shape."
4,Good Memories,"I bought this cd for my baby daughter as I recognised a lot of the songs, I listened to the cd while I cooked dinner last night (my daughter was in bed!!). One of the best compilations for kids."
2,Too academically preppy for me...,"This book may prove valuable if the reader has little or no background with self development and leadership as it relays a lot of truths from those areas with respect to mentoring.However, this book is just not my style. I prefer down to earth, straightforward advice without excess words. My style may not be yours...if you find the following three sentences valuable this book may be for you.1. ""Reinforce creativity while tempering over-expansiveness with reality and pragmatics.""2. ""Allow the protege to serve as your emissary at times--shielded by your reflective power and functioning on your behalf.""3. ""Understand that your affirmative narration will be quite meaningful to your protege and that it will strengthen the mentorship bond.""I read this book front to back and there is a significant amount of repetition. This book is best suited as a reference...if you have an issue or an interest use the index to just read about that particular topic."
2,Did not deliver on it's promise,"A collection of thoughts about mentoring in the workplace. Mostly common sense, a few ""a ha"" moments. All in all I wish they backed up the information with more factual data about WHY. They start the book describing how they will distill all of the existing studies and work into this book. While they might have done this they did not get into the WHY or stats as to why this is the right way.An OK skim from the library...not a purchase."
4,Book review,"This book really helped me to understand what was going on medically, when my horses get Arthitis. It shows what to do, and how to pontenatly treat it. A must for horse owners"
2,No good,"I'll keep this short. My sons room is 10'X12' and this heater could not warm his room up more than 3 degrees despite running all night. Plus I noticed that the fan blows at a constant rate whether you switch it between high or low, that baffled me. Heat couldn't be felt from more than 18 inches away. I am returning it today."
2,Good at first,"This heater worked very well for about 5 months, then it began shorting out. It's great while it's working, but it seems that the longevity issue isn't isolated. It's too much money for it to break so soon."
4,Larry's review,The heater is great. We have a small bed room we are using it in. We just set the temperature we want and forget it. The shipping was faster than expected. Thanks for a great product. Larry
2,Broke after only 2 months,"Brought this heater a couple of months ago. Initially it worked great, and could heat up a small room in about 1/2 hour or so. But now when I leave it on for about 15 minutes, it makes a strange noise and I can smell smoke coming out of the device. For $50+, that's a lot of money wasted."
1,unhappy Inconvience,"I ORDERED, PAID AND WAITED FOR WEEKS I HAVE NEVER RECIEVED THE PRODUCT AND WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN FROM AMAZON. NO ONE EVER EVEN CONTACTED ME FROM AMAZON THEY JUST TOOK MY MONEY AND RUN.NOT COUNTING THE FACT THAT I WAITED NOT WANTING TO BUY ANOTHER HEATER THINKING THIS ONE SHOULD ARRIVE ANY DAY??? THIS THING HAS COST ME MUCH MORE THAN THE PRICE I GOT RIPED OFF FOR.Rev. Dan Bloodworth"
1,Absolutely Useless,"We've had this heater for two months now, and it is a complete piece of junk. It only ever seems to put out cold air. It says it will only blow cold air to keep an accurate temperature reading, or to not overheat, but it doesn't blow hot air enough to get even warm to the touch! Every now and then it will put out a little heat, but only for a minute or two, then it goes back to cold air. I thought I bought a heater, not a fan. It is going back to the store this weekend. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HEATER!"
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"Waste of money!!After one winter it died. When you turn it on, the digital display fades out after 3 seconds and the heater won't turn on.To their credit--after speaking to a Holmes representative, they are sending me a new unit free of charge and without proof of purchase. I just need to send the old unit back after I receive the new one.I hope this one works!"
2,Have I Heard This Song Before?,"I like Alicia Keys, but I can always tell what artist she was listening to before she wrote/recorded this song. Even though I am young, I listen to music from the 50s, 60s and 70s. This song sounds a remake of an Aretha song with some Donny in it. In other words, this song is NOT original at all!! I do love the message of this song, but this sounds like a song I already heard before."
3,Nearly Ain't Here,"When I hear a song by Alicia Keys, it sometimes can be just amazing. Whether it is a enjoyable ballad like Fallin', or a Hip Hop rhythm like Girlfriend, she seems to have it all in one roll. Though, there is a once in a while time, a song from hers doesn't have what she is made of. Her recent track, If I Ain't Got You, does have that feel similar to Roberta Flack, but the song doesn't seem to hit the chemistry You Don't Know My Name, or How Come You Don't Call Me influenced a few years ago. Although there also isn't much R&B out right now, largely because of manufactured acts, the song will just have to do right now. I suggest you listen to this for yourself, and see what the pianist from New York City has developed."
2,"decent song,but wrong voice","how I wish a Gladys Knight,Whitney Houston,mariah Carey would do a song like this.Alicia Keys has those grand sweeping cuts that jack from the past as do many Acts but in Her case you always feel like you are playing name that tune.Her voice for me never reaches the moutain that the Build up of these songs&that always leaves me feeling a cold vibe.this cut is cool but if somebody who had some steam was singing it then it would truly cook."
3,details were not helpful,This mirror description did not say whether it was an electric mirror or not. I needed the electric one and of course this one wasn't electric. It also didn't fit my car like amazon said it would.
1,Deceiving book .,"History of Goju-Ryu by Morio Higaonna Sensei.This (too expensive) book is deceiving. Even though we are hungry for the history of our Karate-do, what we need is ""facts"".The information in this book is contradictory with other sources like Seikichi Toguchi's ""Okinawan Goju-Ryu"" I and II, Shoshin Nagamine's ""Tales of Okinawa great masters"", Patrick McCarthy's ""The bible of Karate - Bubishi"" and Mark Bishop's ""Okinawan Karate: teacher, styles and secret techniques"" regarding the dates an personality of some masters. Sensei Higaonna (who is 7th Dan Goju-Ryu) put his sempai Anichi Miyagi on an altar but throws mud over Masters like Seko Higa!!?? He doesn't talk about the technical quality of other senior Sensei like Meitoku Yagi, Seikichi Toguchi, Eiichi Miyazato, Kanki Izumigawa, Seiichi Akamine, etc.I think we have enough of this ""only we have the real form of the Kata and the truth of the style""."
4,Track Names and Artists,"I don't get why the track names are not included in the item description, this should be standard info. The film credits list 7 tracks. I list them here in order with a track number, track name, performed by, and year: 1) The Best Two Years, Scott McLean, 2003; 2) Someone Else, Scott McLean, 1999, 3) Promised Land, John Batdorf, 1998; 4) Falling, Scott McLean, 2003; 5) Don't You Know, John Batdorf, 1994; 6) Take My Life, Scott McLean, 2002; 7) God Bless America, Hobble, 2004. Hobble: Oriah Lonsdale (Vocals), Mike Flatten (Guitar), Tom Balentine (Bass), and Gene Paul Loncon (Drums). Tracks 1, 2, 4 written by Michael McLean & Scott McLean. Tracks 3, 5 written by Michael McLean & John Batdorf. Track 6 written by Michael McLean."
2,Too technical,"This book is full of scientific names and terms for the trees and shrubs. The book does include a small section with common names, but even that mostly useless because it is not associated with pictures. We were hoping for a book with common names of trees and shrubs along with easyily identfiable pictures, this book is better suited for scientific purposes."
4,learn ArcView,"You get a quick introduction to using GIS with geographic data. Perhaps the best thing about the book is the exposure you get to ArcView, which is one of the major GIS products out there in the marketplace. The book assumes no prior exposure to GIS. But if you are majoring in any of the earth sciences (geography foremost amongst these), then using GIS has now become a de facto mandatory requirement of your discipline. The book takes much of the mystique and difficulty out of using GIS.The book's brevity means that it does not go into any topic in detail. Perhaps the authors are planning sequels along these lines?"
5,A Historical Wonder,The Widow's Peak is entertaining page after page. Eakes has found a way to make romantic history come alive. Her descriptive powers do more than let you know what Leah and Neal are wearing. You will feel the 'rasp of Neal's beard brushing Leah's hair.' Leah isn't a wimpy herione even though it is tough for her to make it in society. She's someone you'd like to have as a friend and find out if her courage would rub off on you. Excellent read!
5,Good Quality,"Good quality item. The TV I mounted weighs 75 lbs. Good instructions. My wife even complimented me on the installation and the finished ""look"" of the mounted TV - and she only compliments me about once a decade.Lots of value here for $30 shipped."
1,Good design but wrong parts,"This appears to be a good design, but the manufacturing went wrong; the bolts that hold it together should have been 7mm and they are only 6mm, and this allowed the platform to sag badly!"
2,Price cheap for reason - beware!,"I bought this because it was a good price for something we wanted to get for our TV. When we put it up on the wall and put our TV on it (20""), the mount appeared to not be very stable. We didn't want the TV falling and crashing so we took the mount down and put it in a different room with a smaller TV. It now has a 13"" TV on it, and works fine. This wall mount definitely will NOT hold the weight it is intended for, however."
4,Great for reshaping edges,This product is a bit pricey but worth it. Having both extra coarse and coarse grits will save you time in reshaping a blade or tool's edge.
4,Sharpens even and fast,First time user of Diamond over stones. Sharpened quicker and flatter using the Extra Coarse/Coarse Fine and a General Tools 809 Chisel/Plane Blade Sharpener method.Didnt need to go to Extra fine as this was way sharper already than what Id ever had it. The only question remaining is how long the Diamonds will last.
2,disappointed,"Amazon's service and speed are great. I ordered this thinking it would solve my problem of my car ejecting disc with ""bad disc"" error message. Unfortunately it didn't do the trick... problem still exists, so guess it had nothing to do with it being dirty. Actually the player just ejected this disc too.Evidently it is something more serious going on with the unit... figured it was worth a try but ended up a waste of time and money. Please note, this is not Amazon's fault....If anyone has any suggestions other than taking it in for service please post them... thanks."
3,works good as stated,My car stereo was reading error everytime I tried to play my CD's couldn't figure out how to clean it until this product popped up. And Now I can play my Cd's just fine!
4,Lens Cleaner,My car CD player was pretty much shot so I decided to buy this. I put it in and it cleaned the lens. The cd worked for some time and then started skipping again. I believe the problem is too much for this lens cleaner to fix. I have no problems with this cleaner. I'm using it in other cars as well!!
4,Happy Customer,"Product: Maxell Automobile CD Lens Cleaner.My car is 11 years old. The CD has been cleaned once. I ran this CD cleaner in my car- it took all of 30 seconds or so. I was more than pleased that it cleaned my CD system. At first I was able to play all teaching CD's. After about 10 hours of playing these CD's one particular one became slurred again. I tried cleaning it but to no avail. However, that was only one. The rest work great. This is an inexpensive way to fix slurred speech on a CD. My system was always able to play music, but didn't do well on teaching tapes.Happy CustomerJetta"
4,Product worked,Was unable to find this product at Wallmart. Reasonable price and my CD player worked after using the product. I would recommed it if your CDs are skipping.
3,"Late, but finally got","Item worked fine. Did not receive regular mail. When told company I had not received it they sent it Federal Express, which was nice of them, but I work two jobs and no one is at my home to receive packages. I had to drive across town on one of my lunch breaks to get the package. WAs not a good experience."
1,Sucks,This product did not help clean my cd stereo at all. I used it about 7 times and in between those times tried putting in my brand new cd and it would still skip repeatedly. I'd advise splurging and getting a more adequate cleaning system or a new stereo instead of being disappointed by this worthless product.
4,good cd cleaner,Worked properly and when i bought it was on sale for 88 cents now its 10 bucks lol. At that price I would shop around.
5,No More Skipping,"I have a 2005 Matrix with a cd player that was always skipping. Even a brand new cd just out of the box would skip. I was about ready to purchase a whole new cd player, when someone suggested cleaning the lens. I bought this and tried it the day I got it, and I have to say I am so impressed. It was so simple to use and my cd player is playing like new. I haven't had any skipping!! I would recommend this to anyone who is getting tired of their cd playing always skipping to give this a try, it worked for me, and is a lot cheaper then a new cd system."
1,Maxell CD-Auto CD Lens Cleaner,I was looking forward to receiving this cleaner and finally having my CD player back. The disk would not play in my Firebird 2001 factory original Monsoon CD player. It immediately ejected. The error code was E20 and a CD cleaner was suggested as a possible solution in the manual. Just be sure and look over other reviews for this item to see if your vehicle has a history of disk acceptance.
4,Auto CD Player Cleaner,The cleaner ran like it was supposed to so I guess it worked. There really is no way to tell if it helped or not i guess.
2,May Work For Dirty CD Player,I tried this CD Lens Cleaner but for me it did not work. Apparently my problem is more than a dirty lens.
1,maxell cd automobile lens cleaner,"This product rates a 0. It doesn't work at all in my automobile cd player. The player rejects the cd cleaner with an error message. If you have an automatic cd player that plays the cd when it is entered in the slot, forget about this product. It simply does not work."
5,THIS BOOK HAS ME IN SO MANY WAYS HIGHLY RECOMENDED,Its a book for profesionals and amateurs alike its easy to read easy to understand from the first page to the last page. Its an absolute must for all singers
5,King (Or Should It Be Queen?) of the Prunes!,"Sure, we all know what prunes are known for. But these are the best by a long shot. Soft, moist, tender, not the hard, dried-out rocks some other brands offer. I like to soak them in orange juice overnight. It plumps them up even more, and gives them a marvelous orangey-pruney flavor.Just wish the Mariani folks hadn't found it necessary to be politically correct and call these ""dried plums."" Next thing you now, we'll be told to call raisins ""dried grapes""!"
2,Uneven results,"The first batch (order) was excellent. In the second batch the prunes were excessively soft and ""gooey"". I won't be reordering this item anymore."
5,iCurve,It is an absolute shame that this product has been withdrawn from Griffin Technology's line because it such an aesthetically pleasing and functional product.
4,Adds some space to desk,"This laptop stand serves 3 main purposes:1. add some space to physical desk2. increase air flow below laptop (macbook white)3. increase screen height for more direct viewing angleThe stand meets expectations for all purposes except for the first, which it only partially meets in my mind. The base needs to be slightly thinner and less curved so that a keyboard can be more easily placed under the stand."
2,Dangerous curves,"You may have read under ""Features and Performance"" in the product description above that ""Laptops fit securely on the iCurve thanks to the nonslip grips. It takes a significant effort to slide the computer along the top of the iCurve, and even then it budges just a little.""Would that that were true! Or should I just say, ""NOT!""After my 17"" MacBook Pro slipped off the iCurve the other day -- and I luckily was able to grab it before it continued its slide off the desk and onto the floor -- I threw the iCurve into the trash. This wasn't the first time the ""nonslip grips"" failed to work, but it was the last for me.I'm replacing it with a Rolodex wire mesh laptop stand (seeRolodex 82444 Laptop Stand, Adjustable, Ventilated, Cord Organizer, Supports 15-Lbs.), which doesn't have the nice storage area underneath for an external keyboard, but which does have a raised front edge to prevent slippage, something the iCurve sorely lacks."
4,Easier on my neck!,"I originally bought this product to protect my wooden desk from the heat of my laptop (for those of you looking for something to serve that purpose, I would suggest a ""chill pad""), but eventually brought it to work instead! I also use a laptop at work, and found my neck to be sore at the end of the day from being hunched over to look at the screen. With the laptop stand, it's now perfectly elevated to my eye level - and no more neck pain! The only one downfall is that you'll have to attach a separate keyboard - the stand jiggles if you try to type on the actual laptop, which personally makes me dizzy when I'm looking at a moving screen! Once you've attached a peripheral keyboard, you should be set to go."
4,Recommended,"The stand is beautiful and really adds a stylish dimension to using your laptop as a desktop replacement; however, the stand feels a little shaky and could stand to be alittle taller and sturdier. I would recommend this purchase for smaller laptops, but if you have a honker (Dell) I would say to opt for a larger (uglier) stand to get the job done."
2,They cool.....reppin that dutty MS,"We did a show with these guys at Northwest Community college back and the day. They had the hot song then ""What U 'Bout"" and that's really the only song that caught my attention that night. I saw that they had potential to be something big. But music with no substance just doesn't get to far now-a-days. I think they should work more on substance and they could be really good. They have the tracks, it just the lyrical content and dition. I'm not knocking them, don't get it twisted, this is nothing more than constructive critism. Never blend in......feel me."
2,Later Judy,"A nicely done repository of Judy Garland photos, especially if you like her later years when she performed live. Could have used more on her Hollywood years. (Would have given more stars for that) Felt as if this book had the bulk of Judy's more well-known fans of the ""Judy as a gay icon"" status in mind. Beware, though: no matter how nice it may be, this book is OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED or I would have given it more stars if it had been reasonably priced. Do they want it to sell or not?"
2,Gushy,"When I picked up this book at the library, the librarian said to me, ""You've got the heaviest book in the library.""I replied, ""It may be heavy in weight, but it won't be heavy reading."" And indeed it was not. The only reason to look at this book is for the pictures, many of which I've not seen elsewhere.The text, however, is gush, gush, gush. The author repeats himself ad nauseum and quotes only people who haven't a single word to say against the great, the fabulous, the one and only legend! It gets tiresome. Yes, Judy Garland was a great talent, but how many times do we have to hear it?"
5,Thanks for the Memory!,No one captured this game the way Steadman did and for that I am so very thankful! I laughed out loud when he talked about the cable going out during the game. That is the easrliest memory I have in my life. My family was very contentious - except during Colts games. So there we sat glued to the TV and then NOTHING! The adored and doted on baby (I was 3) was suddenly abandoned by every other human in the room. Dad ran out back to check with the neighbors to see if their TV had blacked out. Mom ran to the car to try to tune in the game on the radio. And grandmother sprinted up to her room to find her radio. And I wailed! Where had all the good guys gone? Where above all was Gino Marchetti???? Thank you Mr. Steadman. I hear the old fight song in my head when I read your book and it just doesn't get any better for me.
2,Annoying,After watching quality series such as Fringe I realized that I liked only half of the season's shows. I ended up passing most of them up because it's the same o same o. Zombies and wet weather.
5,The X-Files - The Complete Third Season,"Alway loved science fiction. This was a great show, though sometimes I felt like I was watch a Alfred Hitchcock show, kind of left you hanging and forming your own opinion as to what happened. Most shows were great and loved the show."
2,Not for beginners,"This tutorial is not for rank beginners, like me. If you have any experience at all with the pennywhistle, you might find this book and CD to be helpful. Being one completely ignorant of the instrument, the tutorial was pretty close to useless for me. The CD was not of any use also, again, for me...perhaps it would be helpful for someone else. If you've played any wind instrument before, then it might be useful, but for total novices, forget it and find something else."
2,"Not a ""tutor,"" not even close","I seriously doubt that this book has, as it claims, ""taught the joys of tinwhistling to more than one million people worldwide."" If that's how many have bought the book, I bet most of them pretty quickly flung it aside in frustration. For those who have been playing for years and are looking for a little variety, maybe this is the book for them. For others who are still firmly in the ""moderate"" category, this book is next to useless, and teaches only that they have a long, long way to go (with no clear idea from the book of how to get there)."
3,Just Pick Up Your Whistle And Play,"While it is a stretch to say this is a complete tutor, it does permit a first time user to get a pleasant tune the first try. It isn't as easy to use as many others out there, but there is no perfect whistle book. Lots of tunes to make you sound suitably Irish within a week."
3,No whistle in it but awesome book,"I bought this book for my mother who remembers only a small amount of reading music from her childhood piano lessons and she loves it. It tells you about the different kinds of whistles for what you are wanting and is clear and educational. I was unsure if it came with a whistle when I bought it and turns out it doesn't, so if you want a all in one kit, this is almost but not it, if you want something but already have a whistle or want to take your time in learning about it first, this is for you."
1,it looks like it comes with a whistle but it doesnt,this book looks like its supposed to have a whistle and it doesnt. it was a let down
1,JUNK!,"My daughter was so excited to buy this with her Christmas money and ended up disappointed and frustrated when we got it home and it wouldn't work right out of the box. The drawer won't open, there was very little money. The paper money ripped when we took it out of the box because it was stuck to the box w/rubber cement. It's heading back to the store tonight! Biggest piece of junk we've spent $22 on!"
2,Not a whole lot of fun,"My daughter got this for her 4th birthday. She has not played with it at all since the day she got it. It comes with extra items that you can ""buy"" but most are just empty cardboard boxes. She does like the fake makeup though. The cash register is very realistic, which means it gives you a beeping error message if you don't press the keys in the right order. Overall I would say it is not very fun, and I wish I would have gotten her something else!"
1,Garbage,"This toy is garbage. My 4 year old recieved this as a gift and was so excited until we put the batteries in. The cash drawer was jammed shut and had to be opened with a screw driver. If you do not enter the correct mathmatical calculations, you get ERROR messages every time. This was so frustrating for my daughter that we threw it away. The minimum age for this toy shoud be at least 8 years old."
1,Not up to Disney standards,We received this toy as a gift for my 4 year old. It says 4-9 year old recommended but most of the functionality is for minimum 7 year old readers. The drawer did not open until I pried it open with a screwdriver (almost breaking it.) The paper money ripped as I tried to separate it from the package. The calculator function would not make sense to anyone under 9 years old. You need to press the buttons in a specific order to make the calculator work properly otherwise you just end up with a lot of ERROR messages on the display. We have another electronic cash register that I paid (...) for at a dollar store that makes a lot more sense for this age range.
1,christmas disappointment,"my 2 1/2 year old daughter was so excited to get this gift for christmas, but it broke within the first five minutes of play. the drawer stuck shut and neigher myself nor my husband could open it again. all she wanted to do was play with the cash register and we had to box it up so we could [...] it. huge disappointment."
2,The quality is very disappointing.,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves to play with this register, but often gets frustrated because the drawer doesn't work right and the screen only works sometimes.This was an expensive toy and I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I plan on writing the company and complaining. Hopefully other shoppers will avoid the problems I (and the other buyers) have encountered."
1,Don't waste your money,This register is one of the worst toys I have ever bought. The drawer wouldn't open and the coins were attached. The boxes had to be thrown out within a week. I returned the register and got the Barbie register. I must say it was alot better investment and my daughter has more fun playing with it.
2,I didn't like this book,"I bought this book based on the positive reviews. The beginning caught my attention but then my interest quickly faded. The writing is dull. Strangely, this book is about discovering your own hidden desires but the author is maddenly secretive and emotionally retentive. This could be a uselful book to some. I can see how this book would appeal to those who were brought up in really restrictive home/times. It's a good effort but if you really want to read a book about deepening the love of love read Thomas Moore's book 'Soul Mates'. And if you're looking for something to heighten your appreciation of the senses read Diane Ackerman's 'The Natural History of the Senses'."
3,Nice to have on the beach,"As you can read above, this book was nice to read on the beach. I kept wondering if the woman wants to continue her life with her missing husband. I also got a lof of respect for the kept woman."
3,nice to read on a holiday on the beach,"As the title above saids, this book is nice to read on a holiday on the beach. I was (during the whole book) curious if the woman wants to continue her life with her husband. I had a lot of respect for the kept woman."
4,clean design,"I like the clean design of these storage units, and would recommend them to anyone who has need for some low nightstands or accent tables. Assembly was straightforward, requiring no special tools."
3,Small but volume low,"I bought this to replace an older Maxell headset which I've carried in my computer bag for years. They are small enough to work but are nowhere near the volume output of the old ones. However I gave it 3 stars because it otherwise works fine and seems to be well made and...""grandpa-bill doesn't hear as good as he used to"" so these would probably be fine if your hearing is good."
1,Poor Quality,"They're made of 100% plastic. The right side did not work on first use. They also feel very delicate in my hands like they're easily broken. But for the price, hey. I might have a different opinion if they worked out of the box."
2,Poor volume,"THE HEADPHONES ARE COMFORTABLE, BUT THE VOLUME IS LOW EVEN ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL COMPARED TO OTHER HEADPHONES I HAVE USED."
3,Maxell headphones,"OK for price. Fast shipping. Would i order them again, I don't think so, I'd move up in price and hope for a better product"
2,Not even really worth the cheap price,"I know these were cheap, but with the brand name I expected a little bit more. Poor quality for sure. Not even worth the $3+ I paid for them. Just wanted some back-up headphones. I'd say they only seem like they'd be worth $1.50 at best. Can't believe Maxell would even put their name on them."
2,"Chieko rules, but the movie doesn't","Dangerous Game is the poorest of the Zero Woman series, ironic as the gorgeous Chieko Shiratori is probably the best actress to portray the Japanese hit woman. Almost literally nothing happens in this movie, as it's also the most chatty of the series. Still, Chieko takes off her clothes and that's always worth the price of admission."
2,I'd pass on this one.,BF got me this one in red and he got one in the blue.The red is darker than what they show in the photo. (I like his better.)Have had the case for 4 months now.PROS- Screen protector- Hard ShellCONS- The color chips off easily- Case pops open when the phone is dropped- Difficult to utilize the keys with the case on- Adds LOTS of bulk to the phone- Screen protector scratches easilyI would keep looking.I would not recommend this case.
3,case great - clip broke,I like the case. it fits well and looks good.The clip is super fragile - it broke after a week!
1,Poor Product,I had a lot of problems with the case always coming open and the clip broke on the second day. But you get what you pay for.
5,Track Listing,"Excellent Martial Industrial-style music (aka dark militaristic parade music) on Cold Springs UK.01. Edelrost02. Für Kaiser, Gott Und Vaterland03. Die Legion04. Zucht Und Hunger05. Eiserne Menschen06. Zum Appell07. Rasputin08. Leu Der Lüfte09. Lebwohl"
2,I had hoped it would be better.,"A female friend of mine and I decided to look into the Erotic Novel genre, to see how it was written, to see if we could figure out why this genre was becoming so popular with female readers. Unfortunately this novel was a letdown. The story had potential but I thought the writing left much to be desired. The sex scenes were not as sexy as I thought they could have been, but maybe this genre is only focused on giving the reader a rough sketch and then letting the reader's imagination take over. I thought the plot could be better executed and the dialogue less forced and the sex scenes more sexy."
1,Should not be classified as erotica,I have one word for this book BORING!! This book is not Erotica. Doesn't even have the markings or the start to be called erotica.Don't waste your money on it..it will be a complete let down.
5,A perfect performance,"One of the best performances of any piece you will ever hear. Written for Rostropovich, and he gets the desperate wail in this music most cellist miss. Flashy where it should be, quiet where it should be. Brilliant."
5,Good Reading!,I loved the short stories that allowed me to read at my own pace and pick up wherever I left off. Each story is self-contained and has it's own theme.
2,"Product probably good, Seller STINKS!","Product probably good, Seller STINKS! Ordered from this seller and found them to be ""loose"" about shipment. Caveat Emptor!"
4,A Must Read,"Before you join any MLM program you must read this book to get the flavor of what's out there. It is not a ""bible"" but makes a lot of interesting comparisons."
3,Some parts of this book are okay,I agree the comparisons of plans (one of the reasons I bought the book) are hopelessly out of date. At the least the author should have dated the date of his comparison. Many of the lead articles have their use.
5,Great Comfort,I try to keep some copies of this book on hand because it is perfect for when you don't know what to say to someone who has experiences a loss by death. It is good at all stages of grieving and is even helpful years later as I have learned from personal experience. It doesn't need to be read from cover to cover. You can just pick it up and read at random and find answers and comfort. A sad note is that Deannna Edwards just recently passed away at a relatively young age because of illness. I will miss whatever further contributions she might have made to all of us. I also hope that her family will continue to make this book and her other books available to those of us who have found her writting and wisdom so valuable in our lives. I am sorry for their personal loss.
5,A charming animation sure to please children and adults.,"The kids will appreciate the title; the parents will appreciate the content. This is a wonderful animation using the age-old stop motion technique. All I can say is my child loves it and, well, so do I."
1,?,Come on it's a movie about CRAP. People are seriously running out of ideas. They should just keep rereleasing the classics.
4,CD Soundtrack is not the full version,"It is a shame that the so-called included ""Limited Edition"" CD Soundtrack is a cut-down version of the full soundtrack. It is only 8 tracks (~30mins) instead of 15 (~52mins).Nevertheless, still a wonderful, well crafted piece of animation."
1,The Name Says It All,"Is there a rating lower than 1-star? I wish there were. Doggy Poo... that should be your first clue. This movie was not clever, touching, or entertaining. The story of a whiny piece of ""poo"" that is eaten alive by a crafty weed; I say, spread the joy of dandelion seedlings to lawns everywhere... death to DP."
1,Dont be fooled by its uniqueness. Doggy Poo is the WORST thing from Korea to hit the States.,"This movie is sappy and ridiculous. There's a LOT of crying. And I think the English dubbing must have been done by the Teletubbies. What am I bringing away from this film? Apparently dog dookie is pretty stupid, doesnt like being alone, cries a lot, and has low self esteem. Dear Dookie, you can not be as pretty as a star or a dandelion. No, not yours.The fertilizer poo is probably voiced over by Tinky-Winky. He's just as annoying and depressing as the doggy poo.I have a uterus and even I wanted to rip it out of my body and chuck it at the television."
2,A crappy movie about crap,"I am never usually harsh, but its about a terd. Does he find a purpose? Yes, in 'dying' for a flower. Lol, i got it because I though it was funny, but it's serious.it is kinda funny because the whole concept is stupid. No one cares about a pile of poo like that. It was good that pile of dogpoop died, lol. Tell your kids that. After this movie, kids might play with poop or want to with a terd. What a perverted movie. dont treat your kids like idiots."
3,Only For Leaves,This bag works great for leaves but once the leaves are picked up you need the sand silt or your pool will slowly grow full of dirt.
2,Not a replacement for the standard bag,I bought this to replace the bag that came with my Polaris after one of the connection tabs broke on the original. this bag collects leaves and large particles as advertised. My problem with it is that I have my Polaris on a timer and this bag allowed debris to fall back into the pool when the cleaner turned off. It was unable to keep acorns and anything but large leaves inside the bag.This bag could be useful to pick up large amounts of leaves as long as you emptied the bad as soon as the cleaner turned off.I ended up replacing this bag with a standard bag that works great.
4,Great quality,DVDs are of great quality and clarity.A great purchase for any fan of Columbo - at a not very expensive pricel
5,Peter Falk the true Columobo,I already own all the dvds for this set . I am a huge Columbo fan as well as Peter Falk. There will never be anyone like him. The part of Columbo was made for Peter Falk. I liked Mr. Hollow's write up. Thank yo very much. I pull out my Columbo DVD's and have a weekend marathon with them. Many big name stars were on his show and one of him was his good friend John Cassevetes. I believe he was in about 4 of them. What a great series to watch over and over.
5,Lots of fun,I enjpy columbo. The price was cheaper than anyone I could find on the internet. I look forward to watching them all.
5,Great Series at a Great Price,My mother in law was looking for this every where and I found it on Amazon. She loved it and has all the movies.
4,I shall buy this !,"The very COMPLETE Columbo collection, wow ! 69 outstanding and thrilling movies starring the unique Peter Falk. How could ANYONE refuse this ?"
2,"Disc 1, season 2","Disc 1, Season 2 does not play. How do I go about getting a replacement? Is there a phone number I can call?Cheryl Bergen"
2,eh...,"It's just wasn't impressive to me or my toddler. Also, expect varitions such as ""colour"" instead of ""color"" if you purchase this one."
5,Thermwell A/C Weatherstrips,Very pleased with both the product and the service. The strips are very easy to use. The service was excellent
1,Over Rated Product,"This product was advertised as a 19"" Wall Mount. Instructions said up to 19"". When mounted, it is very shaky, small base plate which is more suited for no more than a 13"" TV. It has too many joints which causes the TV to tilt side ways looking precarious and is not suited for a 19"" TV. Do not buy! It's very ugly!"
3,Ok but not Great,"It is ok, the little screen protecor is sorta lame, it just flopps around with no way to lock it in place. I like having it to keep from cracking the screen though. Also a few time while working on a ladder or crawling through an attic access, I bumped the phone, and the whole thing comes apart and the phone crashes to the floor. The belt clip is just awful!"
3,"Sometimes it comes with a belt clip, sometimes it doesn't","I ordered this product the first time and it came as described... it was a very tight fit on the treo but had the advantage of not squeezing down on the keys or screen... no [...] entry like I'd get on cases with transparent plastic over the keys. It was a very good case. The camera, docking port, and everything else you could think of was easily accessible (besides the battery) and it had a little strip to protect the SD card in case of a fall.However the 2nd time I ordered 3 of these (since I break the belt clips a lot) and all 3 came in without belt clips- just a plain back you couldn't hook onto anything... I ended up getting rid of the treo soon after and it wasn't worth the hasle of returning- just be warned you may not get the item exactly described on this page."
2,Just Use Common Sense Instead,"The title is compelling simple, and the book is even simpler. ""Learn people's names"", ""Arrive on time"", ""Don't write too small"". You don't really need a book for this. If you do, well.....you probably shouldn't be in this business. Sorry."
3,Not dishwasher safe,"The cookware does an excellent job, especially on a gas range. The non-stick saute pans are great and clean up is easy. The stainless pans are not as good. I do find that whatever I cook in the stainless pans leaves a mark or a shadow in the pan, especially pasta or vegetables, no matter how hard you scrub the pan. Altho the pan is clean, you can still see the outline of the pasta that was previously in the pan.The pans are very heavy, so I wouldn't recommend them for the weak. This is my second set. The first set I put in the dishwasher, and found that the rivets on the handles and lids corroded almost immediately. I sent the set back to T-Fal and they returned it to me as dishwasher damage not covered by warranty. When I pointed out they advertise the set as dishwasher safe, they sent me a replacement. I now hand wash the new set. It appears to me the rivets are aluminum rather than stainless which is why they corrode."
1,Taking the Moral Highground?? LOL,"Its laughable that this journalist believes she is on any moral highground here.To me the highest moral compass is to honor the truth and goodness.NO one from ANY prefession, be they a journalist or a judge, has the right to dictate toanother that they must be loyal to someone who they believe to be a liar and a killer.I applaude Joe McGuinness for coming to see the truth and remaining LOYAL TO THAT!I also applaude the few defense lawyers in this country who have made similar discoveriesabout their clients and decided they just morally couldn't represent such individuals.A agree with the poster who commented about how some of these people, who stick up forthose whos actions violate the very foundation of life, have got to be a little crazy themselves.They live in some kindof fantasyland and here is just another one."
1,It stopped working!,"It stopped working within a month. The battery is good, according to my jeweler. Aargh!"
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring","Loved the Vampire Academy series. This one is nothing like it. I found it very boring even halfway through the book. Unfortunately, I'll have to keep looking for another good series. The Vampire Academy, in my opinion, was really good. I consumed each book in the series as fast as I could. Succubus Blues could not hold my interest, and I won't be buying another book in this series."
2,Holding out hope that the next one is better.,"I was browsing the library shelves looking for a quick read. I saw this book, but I wasn't impressed with the cover or the synopsis on the back cover. However, I came home and looked the author up and discovered that this author had written another series I had recently read, Vampire Academy. I had enjoyed that series so I ordered this book. The book starts off kinda of slow, but about middle of the book a unique plot starts develops - then it is a pretty smooth read to the end. The characters are a little single-sided. Every male that appears in this book could be future love interests for Georgina which makes me leery of future books. Usually there is a love triangle or a square, but it is almost an octagon - I will have to see where this goes. I have a favorite love interest for her - I will read the next book just to see if it could happen."
3,Not my cuppa tea,"Richelle Mead is a great writer. I love her skill in creating a scene and keeping me interested. But I am not particularly interested in the non-stop sex. It just isn't my cup of tea.Loved Vampire Academy, BTW. That is the reason I bought Succubus Blues and succubus on top.But I am not interested in continuing the series by purchasing any others of the Georgina Kincaid series."
5,Amazing read! Impossiable to put down!,I absolutly ADORED the book! it kept me so engaged that i couldn't put it down and blame richelle for keeping me up until 3am finishing it. But it was well worth it! The characters are completly loveable and it's so easy to really get into their world! I can't wait till the next one! It definatly doesn't suc(cubus). hehe
4,Succubus Blues,This book was somewhat of a surprise. I bought it on a whim at the grocery store of all places because I was bored. I read a lot and love sci-fi/fantasy and figured it couldn't be that bad so I bought it.The story is about a Succubus who has doubts about who she is. Not an altogether unhead of story. Those who watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer will remember her love was a Vampire with a soul and one who wanted to do good and fight evil. The way in which the author plays out the story though is unique and refreshing. The fact that the main character is a female has a lot to do with that.I won't give any spoilers here the book is worth reading for any who like sci-fi/fantasy. I am going to read the rest of the series to see how things turn out. I am interested to see how kind the aurthor is to the plight of her main character.Enjoy the book.
2,So disappointing,"After reading the glowing reviews on Amazon I bought this book, wanting to like it, thinking it would be a wonderful new paranormal series to become addicted to. Yes, it is a fast-paced read and while the premise of a succubus and her demon/angel friends was refreshing, the characters were way too bland. She barely touches on sexuality (infact, the main character seems afraid of it, like she doesn't know what she's doing.. so much for being a succubus). Georgina is entirely unconvincing, she acts like an ignorant, naive, whiny modern girl rather than a centuries old succubus. Give me a break. I kept hoping someone would kill her off and another character could pick up the story."
2,Good Writing But Very Unrealistic Outcome,"Shy Introverted males are not attractive to females in real life, and especially not in fiction. Mead spends the whole book showing what an incompetent introverted socail ""loser"" Seth is, with little redeaming qualities other than he is a good writer and does have some compassion. After a whole book of seeing mostly flaws in Seth, along with ""God-like"" qualities in Roman, we are asked to believe that Seth is the winner of the feisty, brainy, beautiful Georgina, who could have any man. This huge flaw totally takes away from otherwise very good writing, and I was sorry to buy the sequel before I found out Seth and Georgie would become a couple....big let down."
5,If you like...,"I'm just keeping this short and sweet. If you're thinking about reading this book and you enjoyed Betsy the Vampire Queen series, Anita Blake series, and Vampire for Hire novels, you will thoroughly enjoy this book. You will find action, wit, some gore & sex w/o being over the top, and likable characters. Even the unlikable ones are entertaining! I was excited to see that this is a series, so I'm just starting Succubus on Top."
4,What a fantastic surprise,"Bought this based on other amazon reviews - figured I'd give it a try and the Kindle price was such that I figured it wouldn't be a huge loss if I didn't love it. Welp, turns out I DID love it and am thrilled to have a new character to follow. As any book lover can attest, it is like Christmas when you discover a new series by chance - no expectations, just a willingness to open the cover and see what awaits! Loved the Seattle backdrop (not from Seattle but always appreciate a change in scenery from the usual suspect cities). Love Georgina and the fact that while it's a book about a sexual being, it's SO MUCH MORE than that! I'm just starting out but REALLY looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series and seeing what else Richelle Mead has to offer in her other series."
3,mixed feelings...should I read another?,"Since I really like vampire/werewolf/paranormal books, I saw the good reader reviews for this series and decided to give the first book a try. I really liked Georgina's character and the story for the most part but for me the love interest in this book (Seth)is kind of boring. I found Roman's character to be more of a draw but it looks like Seth is supposed to be her true love in this series. I'm interested to hear from other readers if the next book is worth reading or if it will be more of the same."
3,"Not great, but still kind of good","I was a bit reluctant at first about this book, beeing a succubus-story and all. I don't like page after page of sex-scenes in books, so it was a pleasant surprise that the author did not fall in to that trap. (There are of course sex-scenes, just not as much as you might expect from the title).The first thing that struck me is that Georgina, a several centuries old succubus, acts like she is perhaps twenty years old. And the story it self, I could smell the plot a mile away from the beginning of the book.There is not a whole lot of action in this book either.But I have to say I found the book good despite the flaws. I have ordered and are about to read the rest of this series, because I find Mead to be a very good writer!"
4,Wow!,Loving this series rite now a little late to start but now I'm hooked I'll catch up quick! What is next for Georgina
2,Not very good,"I didn't get past the first several chapters. At first it seemed ok, then I just got bored. It also seemed a little immature."
5,OUT OF THE GATE A WINNER,"Every now and then you will come across and author that will knock your socks off. This is one of those times. Succubus Blues by Richelle Mead is a complelling story of a Succubus that is looking for love. Sounds simple right? The problem is that she cannot get close without literaly sucking the life out of that person, slowly. A succubus needs the life energy in order for her to live. She may be able to have all sex she wants, but a close realionship she will never have.This story come to life and jumps off the pages at you. It is witty and complelling in that each and every charater is important to the story. In itself this is unusal, most of the time secondary characters take time to develop. Not so here, and you will become just as involved with them and their story. Soon you find that they haved wormed into you heart and you too have become part of this powerfully written and so enjoyable story about the never ending battle between good and evil."
2,"Love Richelle Mead, but not this series","I love the Vampire Academy series by this author, so I decided to give this series a try. I wasn't very impressed. For an evil and old succubus who has lived since the 5th century, the protagonist Georgina is very immature and stupid. I couldn't really get into it. Considering a succubus lives off sex, the main character has a lot of sexual escapades and there are many sex scenes. Honestly, if your job has been having sex with different men in order to corrupt their souls and drain some of their energy to live, it's kinda hard to sympathize with you. Not my cup of tea."
5,Addictive series,"I love this series. It is very much a ""guilty pleasure"" as it is interesting, addictive and most assuredly not going to win any awards. I love reading paranormal romance because it allows me to escape reality and relax. I enjoy the authors creativity and her writing style. I would recommend this whole-heartedly to anyone else who enjoys my same ""guilty pleasure."""
1,didn't enjoy,"I honestly got through a few chapters of this book and lost interest. It wasn't my thing, I guess. Perhaps I didn't give it a chance, but I found myself thinking about lunch instead of focusing on the book."
4,Great book!,"I'm a big fan of Vampire academy and Bloodlines, so I thought i would check this series out. It did not disappoint-! I gave it four stars because it gets kinda racy in some chapters and I'm not a big fan of that but the plot and characters are well rounded and funny. I would definitely recommend this book to people who are fans of Meads work, and paranormal romances."
4,the sounds of hell await,"Before I even began listenning to black metal, I heard the song Destroyer and it absolutely blew me away. Sheer blinding brutality followed by great musicianship-perhaps it is no understatement I would never be the same again.This album marks the transformation of Gorgoroth from the more old school black metal to a new more innovative mode. Accented with odd effects here and there, intense guitars and Ghaal's vocals make this album both heavy and dark.It has been criticized by fans somewhat as not being linear and all over the place. But it is still a fine work from a great band."
3,not as good as their other stuff,"when this came out, I ran out and got it, because all their other c.d.s are awesome. I was disapointed. If you've never heard gorgoroth, don't get ""destroyer"", but instead get ""under the sign of hell""(*****), ""antichrist""(****), or ""pentagram""(***1/2). Destroyer is still good, but not as flowing, could be partly due to every song being performed by different people playing different instruments."
4,An interesting historical look at gynecology,"Starting with vivid descriptions of gynecology's roots in American slavery, the focus of the woman's body is set up as a theatre for men's enjoyment. The above section is desciptive enough to make a woman's insides turn in horror, as the mistreatment and unhygenic display of black slave women's reproductive systems is described in detail.Carrying this idea of gynecology as a theatre, Kapsalis introduces graphic photos of actual theatre performances of the use of the speculum. This shocking portrayal allows for the movement of gynecology and the acceptance of the woman's body that is paramount to the book's conclusion.Overall, an intersting read. Not five stars, as it is a bit slow in sections. Over emphasis on the ""speculum play""..."
3,"Good for foamy, not for paper...","This die is cute, but my wife couldn't use it with paper, just for cardboard and foamy sheets. With them, it works!"
3,Okay...,"I am a huge RTF fan, and saw them several times live back in the '70s. They were great. This DVD? Not so much. There is plenty of technical excellence but not much feeling. I might also say that they don't seem to be having very much fun.I don't know. Something seems to be ""off."""
2,not even close,"honesty and integrity is the best policy..knowledge and experience make it hard often to see musicians who created the best and than perform weak.all of the reviews are not seeing what actually went down.lenny is 1/1000th the drummer he was.listen,i repeat listen to no mystery studio album in its entirety.the drums are some of the fastest most powerful drums ever recorded.he is drumming in slow motion now.he has had surgery,so i give him a break,but the reviews are almost comical.the performances themselves are showy and flashy with out substance.song to the pharoh kings doesnt even resemble what once was.theres no structure,except for giving everyone a chance to solo.al is just burning now live.theres no character.listen to jeff beck currently who still delivers.this was a weak weak concert.good for those who do not have the experience,the knowledge and the integrity to speak the truth. long live the original sound awaken!"
4,A Welcome Return To Forever,"I had a chance to see this tour. They were awesome !! This DVD is great for those that didn't get to see them live. If you are just getting into this group, I recommend to check out their albums from the 70s. I look forward to some new material from them. This one of the best Jazz fusion group ever! Great DVD this is a MUST to get!"
5,5 stars concert!,"Just a great Return to Forever concert! If you like their music, you'll love this dvd. It's great to see them perform their songs up close like from a front row seat!I've have a lot of concert dvds, and this rates up there in the top 5."
5,Return to Forever still cookin'!,"This is an absolutely fabulous DVD concert. Return to Forever is still fantastic 30 years later! I'm so glad they got back together for their recent tour. This is not just a rehash of their old songs, they've added new life to them. Al, Chick, Stanley and Lenny are all still very strong artistically and mesh very well together. And the DVD quality is excellent also, great sound and camera work. This is a must have DVD for Return to Forever fans."
5,Return to Forever forever..!!,I'm a fan since my 15 years...I see them in Valencia (Spain) and what a fantastic concert was. This video is a must have for all the group fans.
2,not what it says,its not a live cd. just one song from.but the band its really good. one of my favorites actually.i bought it cause i never heard of it.it could be better known as greatest hits.
5,"Big socket, little price","This socket is exactly what it says it is. A 54mm Hex socket. I ordered it for fitting the locknuts on my Toyota Pickup's front wheel hubs. Shipped promptly, in excellent packaging (inside a cardboard box, in a blister-pack type plastic wrapper)."
5,The forgotten circus classic--The Big circus,"Such a great circus picture! I can't understand why it hasn't been released, or at least easily located. Great performances, including 2 great stars cast against type: Peter Lorre as a clown, and David Nelson as a circus flyer with a dark secret. Even a cameo of Steve Allen, hosting a televised performance by the circus. A great mystery, much suspense, some clever humor, this movie has it all. For the ladies--that Victor Mature was quite a hunk! If you can possibly see this film in any format, don't miss it!"
5,Classic Film Man,"I remember seeing this film in the theater with my Mom, Dad and brothers. It was exciting and entertaining, with some suspense. So, it was with some trepidation that I viewed it with my wife and kids during one of its rare TV showings, fearing that it wouldn't hold up all these many years later. How pleasantly surprised I was to discover that not only did I enjoy it all over again, but so did my family. I am mystified why this film has not been released on DVD? Is there some dispute as to clear title, ownership or other entanglement that held up the release of so many other gems in the past? If so, please, please resolve those issues and let the public enjoy this little gem of a movie."
3,Tightrope walk over Niagara Falls better than real thing,"I saw this movie after watching the hyped up Niagara Falls crossing a few weeks ago. Amazingly, in this old movie a circus performer takes a similar route over Niagara Falls, only in day light (the movies still know things real people don't), and I found it more interesting by far than the real thing. I think the daylight made all the difference, but also, he was thrown a curve that was infinitely more entertaining (can't reveal it here), than the difficulties the actual tightrope walker encountered. In this case, fiction was stranger than truth. Also, no hokey border crossing check at the end. I guess when you have Peter Lorre, Vincent Price and Victor Mature to greet you, it's also more exciting. Other than this scene and a few circus numbers the movie was kind of hokie, with bad broadway-like singing accompanying the opening and closing of the circus."
4,Entertaining,The Big Circus was entertaining to watch. It was wonderful to see several film noir stars in a big colorful production. Victor Mature was great as the Big Circus leader-owner and leading star. Red Buttons and Vincent Price are always enjoyable to watch. You really feel you are part of circus life as you are watching this film.
5,Nice product,"I had the filters that come with the whole unit I originally bought, but having an extra set to just drop in makes life just a little easier."
3,Average brush,This brush is overpriced and Purdy is over-rated. Bought this expensive brush for a fine furniture project I was working on and quickly switched back to my Wooster natural bristle brush.
5,perfect,"Well what can i say? Kate Moss is by far my favourite supermodel of all time. Her beuaty and ability to change herself into someone else in every photo is amazing. Although some may say oh it's just photos , these photos are amazing and capture storylines and the early six years of her amazing career , a collaboration with photographers , stylist , make up artist etc. Kate Moss includes a witty introduction for the book ending it with a witty: p.s : i am just on my way out to dinner to eat a massive steak and loads of fattening potatoes , with loads of butter. What a brilliant ladies. The photos captured go from her early days to now - 1995. Theres also some baby pictures of Kate .. and from when she was 13 and stuff. Brilliant perfect and Kate Moss autographs it .. of course it is noly photocopied"
3,"It isn't bad, but it could be better...","I'm a photographer myself. The book was fine, the pics were fine, they only weren't better because of Kate herself. Sorry, but i'd prefer a book by Kirsten Owen or Guinevere van Seenus, or male models such as Rafal S. and Freddie Drabble, I mean, models with a bit of personality. My tip is to check out Fashion:Photography of the Nineties. That's hardcore photography in action..."
4,"Perfect photos, but you won't know Kate any better than now","I rather admired all these photographers than Kate Moss herself - This book contains no writing except the foreword by Kate, and you still hardly know who she is after you read the book. There are many excellent pictures, and I can recommend this book to any photographer or artist. (But you should look for other books if you are into sexy pictures!) It's just too bad that it doesn't say a word about who Kate really is."
5,Simply amazing,"Well, what can I say? This book is simply amazing written by an amazing woman. Please purchase this book. You won't be disapointed. Your life will begin to change from the first page through to the very last. I know mine was. Again, simply amazing!"
3,Good for those starting out,"I think I have read too many of this style of books now. I do like Denise Lim as an author, just didn't get alot from this particular book."
5,Warm Happy Vanilla,"I adore this perfume! It smells just like I titled this review, warm, happy, and vanilla-y. It's not too strong or too weak. It is the perfect neutral perfume. Some days I like to smell girly, some spicy, some sporty, etc. This perfume I can wear any day no matter what mood I'm in and I will like it. It also mixes wonderfully with almost any other fragrance for a scent that is customizable. I really couldn't say enough good things about it. It's really the perfect scent. I like it much better than Hypnose (the other vanilla by Lancome). If you are considering buying it for yourself or as a gift, you really can't go wrong."
2,Not Close-Captioned,"Beware that this variant of Marvin's Room is not Close-Captioned. If you are hearing impaired, as I am, buy another variant of Marvin's Room. I purchased this new edition of Marvin's Room without noticing that it does not have the Close-Captioning that the previous editions have. I am unable to follow much of the dialogue."
5,Still the best of 1996.,"I still consider this film to be the best movie of 1996. I can't get over how much I love and admire this story and the characters and the stars. So much is said, what our society needs to be told today, and what we should do to cherish the ones we love in life."
4,Acting trio make this film an worth seeing.,The acting makes the film an experience worth watching. The sensitivity of the portrayals at times touch the heart and make you think. You can almost forget who's in this film and experience it's sensitive message.
2,SLOW,I think this is the slowest movie I've ever seen. The characters aren't that believable and the characterizations are lean. It was boring.
5,Wonderfully Funny? Not.,"Marvin's Room stars Meryl Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Diane Keaton, and Robert DeNiro. All are exceptional actors/actresses and I enjoyed the movie because of its tagline that rings true throughout the movie: Sometimes the people you know the least are the ones you need the most!On the cover of the movie reads, ""Wonderfully Funny!"" -- Gannett News Service. I don't get it. Funny? Wonderfully funny? There's sickness and bitterness and anger and love in this fine movie, but not once did I laugh. Sorry, too serious of issues for me to laugh my head off.Marvin's Room is a touching movie and the actors are brilliant just the same. I recommend highly."
4,Excellent performance by Leonardo Dicaprio as usual,I thought this movie was very good.Everyones performance was excellent especially Leo's potrayal of Hank.I am a huge fan of Leonardo's and I have not yet seen a bad performace by him on-screen.The movie really touched me and it really shows how important family is.2 thumbs up!! END
3,What an ending!,"This is one of those movies that the last 5 minutes MAKE THE MOVIE. Everything before this, especially the typical bickering between Streep and DiCaprio, has been seen before. The last moments, though with Keaton and Croynon, are so touching, they almost make up for a predictable and tiresome film."
4,Marvin's Room is both tear-jerking and funny,"I loved the movie for many reasons. It was very realistic, the acting was well done by Keaton, Streep,and DiCaprio. The ending was wonderful as well because it stimulates the viewers mind. It makes us think about what happened next, and leaves it to our imagination. Well Done! END"
4,A heartwarming movie,I really enjoyed this movie because it was funny as well as sad in parts. Leonardo Dicaprio is by far the best actor I have ever seen.
5,Heart-renching performance,Leonardo DiCaprio by far the best actor gives an astonding performace. He brings character to the screen and everyday feelings of people like the character to life. This movie will bring tears to the eyes and a great love to the heart END
5,Marvin's Room,"The DVD came in the time the vendor said it would and was in the condition the vendor said it would be in. The only problem was that it was marked for European T.V. and I do not have a DVD for European DVD's. I contacted the the vendor and they said it was plainly marked on the Amazon sight. I checked and it was. They told me they would refund the product, but not the shipping. I decided to give it to some friends of mine who have a DVD that will play it, and order a new one from another company."
2,Marvin's room,"Sorry, wish I had not bothered with this one. I am a Meryl Streep fan, but even she could not help this one. Not a chic flick, not a drama, not a family movie... not sure who it was for."
5,Wonderful,"Everyone involved in this movie was superb. The Aunt stole the show, her remarks throughout were hilarious. This movie shows the sacrifice needed in times of trouble and illness. Robert De Niro was in the film minimally but made his mark with more comic relief. I think the movie made good transitions between the happy and the emotional moments. Overall this is an excellent film."
4,a family movie,"I rented this movie because of Leonardo DiCaprio. It turns out that he's kind of a bad boy. But I enjoyed it. It was heartwarming and lets you see more what you got in life right now. Diane Keaton was like a saint. She is an inspiration to those that want to devote their lives assisting elderly. Overall, this movie is not for action kind of people END"
4,I love this film,"This movie is really good, I hired it because i'm a big fan of Meryl Steep, she was really outstanding!! The movie was one of the best i've seen! See it! END"
1,This company is awful!,"I received the DVD timely, yes BUT that was the ONLY good thing. It is scratched through the whole movie after the 1st hour. I contacted the company that I bought it through and NEVER received a response at all. I will never order from importcds again. It does not matter the amount of money we spend if they sell it and we buy it, there should be respect on both ends."
2,a 12 year olds review,This movie is boring and it is NOT funny. When I rented it I thought it would be funny but it wasnt.its actuly sort of sad.
5,Best DiCaprio's Movie,This is one the best movies of the last years. A great story that talks about the years that keep people apart and the moments that bring them together... as the movie says. You will fall in love with Leonardo DiCaprio in this movie! I did!
1,Never recieved this DVD,"Since it has been so long since I ordered but NEVER RECIEVED this movie and couldn't tell you whom it was from, I have no oppinion re. this movie.If you pay for something and it asn't delivered it it considered ""cheating the customer""?It moght have not been Amizon's falt but it sure is the 1st time EVER (:::To bad :("
1,Worst Chill CD I have ever heard,"I have long been a huge fan of ""chill"". I have hundreds of CD's in this genre. That said, halfway through the first disc I feel compelled to stop and warn readers here who see nothing but five star ratings like I did... that this chill cd at the very first song made me think about vomiting while trapped in an tacky office elevator. If you want chill that David Lynch might put behind a very weird scene in a movie or that would make a Stepford wife reach for the bottle, gulping, for escape rather than sipping a neat martini in a glass... this off-putting fluff-chill for zombies might be for you. So far there have been a few songs that i would call acceptable but things better pick up soon or i will simply delete this thing entirely in horror of ever hearing most of it ever again. Now to wash my brain out with some Bomb The Bass, Quantic or Nightmares On Wax."
5,Great Prokoviev,"First rate recording because it is an absolutely essential performance, the kind of performance one recalls all one's life when thinking of this most important of Prokofiev's symphonic achievements."
2,You get what you pay for,You get what you pay for in a UV/Haze filter. These Canon UV/Haze filter are junk...too wide and they end up producing vignetting on my wide-angle lenses. The only Canon UV/Haze filter that I found to be good was the 77mm L39 Sharp Cut (which I can't find any more!).
3,Not a whole sponge,"This sponge was cut, creating a hard, unnatural line, which is exactly what you don't want to do when you're sponge paiting. You should keep looking for a good sponge somewhere else. I haven't been happy with any of the sponges sold on Amazon."
5,Superb Writing,"For a self-published book, this is extremely well-written and well done. Truly impressive work."
5,Wow,"I know the author personally though he may not remember me; hopefully that does not exclude me from 'objectively' reviewing this. First, I don't find it hard to believe that he wrote it, not at all, but I am stunned by the incredible detail and depth at which the characters were developed. I am so proud of this book and his accomplishment that it scares me to think he's just started writing a few years ago. A well-crafted and complete story begins with the heart of a true and pure writer, which Marvin is. During ""the early years"" I can remember things he wrote for school assemblies that brought tears, laughter and provoked deep thought. Take my word for it, this book will shock and awe you at a very talented man."
3,Touchy,"This is a great little remote, although in the first week since I received it, I've had to reinstall it 4 times. I've been using on a 32bit Vista Home Premium laptop.It works fine with Windows Media Center. When playing DVD's though, there's no button that's the equivalent of ""Menu"" on a DVD remote.Update 12/20/2007: Returning this item. I have to reinstall it daily in order for all of the buttons to function."
3,works great providing you have the right equipment,"this is an amazing little piece of technology. I live in a college dorm that was built in 1965 with 6"" thick concrete walls. this device will transmit through 2 of them without trouble. However, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE AN EXPRESSCARD SLOT AND NOT A PCMCIA SLOT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PIECE OF EQUIPMENT!!!! This piece will work with newer HP notebooks, Dell notebooks, some Toshiba & Compaq notebooks. Will not work with Sony Vaio or MacBooks. I have to charge it off of a friend's computer because I have a Viao."
5,Works well as advertised...sticks out of the slot though...,"Excellent product for what it advertises to do. Works extremely well on Windows Vista. Highly recommend for laptops (needs the pci express slot for charging, guess that rules out pc's). Compatible with Dell Media Direct and Vista Media Center. Charges automatically in the slot.Negative - Sticks out about half an inch from slot, shape feels slightly awkward in handOverall an excellent product for its advertised function."
4,Great but no laser pointer,"This remote has served me well for over six months. It stores within the card slot on your laptop, though it does stick out about 1/2"". It recharges off the computer's power, so you never have to replace batteries, and because it works off Bluetooth you never have to plug in a dongle to the USB port. The only two things it lacks are the ability to control the mouse, and a laser pointer. If you are highly dependent on these features, choose a different device, but if you want a remote that is always with you for controlling media and/or PowerPoint this is an excellent device."
3,It's OK,"It needs to work with more media software. good for itunes, windows media but not much else."
4,great gadget,"this remote is very usefull, makes life very easy to view and control wmc and also for powerpoint presentations. The only drawback is that it pokes out a lot from the slot and that is very very annoying. Besides this, great gadget.PS: btw, to pair must press both volume up and volume down so it enters pair mode..."
5,Works flawlessly,"Discovery was a snap and so far I've successfully used this with iTunes, Media Player, Media Center and Joost Beta on a ThinkPad T61p running Vista Ultimate. Absolutely no issues. It just works. Suprisingly it also works (to the limited degree that it can with so few buttons) with web browsers - you can scroll up/down and left right and go back. Presumably this would work with other apps that recognized those keys. It should also work with PowerPoint and other similar apps.The only (minor) disappointments are that it is a notched rectangle and that it sticks out of the Express card slot."
4,Wonderful stories!,"The author has given us a great slice of her life, discovering a desire to support our soldiers, especially those wounded in our service. She found her way to the Soldier's Angels organization, and then things got interesting! By turns hilarious, heartwarming, and serious, this is a well written, really entertaining book. It left me hoping to see more!There are several real-world stories from the perspective of Soldier's Angels, family members, and service people, and they really hit home. For others who might be intrigued and want to do the same thing, she gives some very helpful advice and encouragement, too."
3,doesn't quite fit,"The product I got was just a little too big for my Canon SD630. I tried trimming a bit off and I cut off too much, so now there's a small gap of exposed screen.In spite of the size problem, it still seems beter than the ShieldZone cover I tried earlier. Plus, it has the anti-glare feature. I might buy another and try to trim it correctly."
2,Good protector but corners are dimpled,"I like the product and it fits the screen quite well. However, there are ""dimples"" in each of the corners that make the screen look bad. I emailed to ask about the ""dimples"" and here was their response:""According to the Engineering Department, all the screen protectors for the Canon PowerShot SD630 have ""dimples"" on the corners, as this is how they are cut from the factory. Therefore, it is not a defective unit.If the screen protector is not pulled off and on frequently, I am quite confident that dust and link particles will not be trapped under there.""I would definitely try another product if I were you as the dimples are quite annoying and I do not understand why they are there.-Mike"
4,Perfect fit makes application a bit tedious.,The screen protector is the exact same size as the screen which makes it a bit difficult to apply it properly. If you don't line it up exactly along the edges before you lay it accross the whole screen it will end up too far on the other side of the screen and give you a big bubble.It took me about 5 or 6 tries to get it right. If it was just 1mm smaller it would get a 5 star rating.
4,it's modern but a bit watered-down,"I am usually a big fan of contemporary poetry, but this collection is of mostly sentimental, non-experimental scandinavian poetry. As with older Scandinavian poetry, there's a lot of nostalgia for the natural, and unlike the older poetry you get a feeling of desire-for-the-natural instead of mere appreciation of it. Since much of this poetry is post-WWII, Scan.'s first real entry into the Western world, there seems to be an almost Wordsworthian tone (as in ""The World is too much with us""). If you like that kind of thing, this book is for you-- it's also well-bound, a good volume for the price. If you're looking for the kind of rash experimentalism of the post-Viking era, however, you're out of luck."
4,Effective and a real time saver,"Faced with 96 rounded mortises to square, I purchased this chisel in the hopes that it would be easy to use, quick, and effective. It was all three. The price is a bit on the high side, but considering the additional time it would take to manually square these mortises with a regular chisel, I thought it was worth it. My only complaint is that orienting the chisel precisely in the rounded corner is not foolproof, sometimes resulting in corners that are not quite square. You have to eyeball the chisel in relation to the existing mortise to correctly position it vertically and horizontally before striking it. The chisel housing should be molded in a way that makes it a no-brainer to firmly register both sides of it against the existing mortise to guarantee perfect 90-degree corners. But if you take your time and make sure the chisel is positioned correctly before striking it, this little tool will save you a lot of time and give you perfectly squared mortises."
2,A little disappointing,"Packaging ridiculously difficult to extricate product from. The icecream maker is primitive, but after all that work, makes only a tiny amount and my child was a little disappointed."
3,Toy for a 5 year old,"My five year old loved the Bratz Kidz Super Secret Ice Cream Making Snow Lodge but it took forever to dislodge the actual item from its container. Then we tried to make ice cream and it turned out to be ice milk. Overall, she liked it and that's what matters most."
2,Don't waste your money,"This toy, as fun as it looks, is a nightmare if you actually want to make ice cream. There is a lot on manual work to make the ice cream and its not even close to what you see on the commercials (I know big surprise). It even calls for rock salt, which I found almost impossible to find in the stores.Except for the playset itself, save your money and buy a powered ice cream maker."
1,Do they seriously expect people to pay $50.00++?,"My DD had wanted this for Christmas. It was all she talked about, how she wanted her ice cream maker..Well, I found one for $10.00 right here on Amazon. I purchased it. After spending 20 minutes unwrapping the stupid thing..We were FINALLY ready to make ice cream!Oh wait, no. No we weren't. Because all they give you are sprinkles! Isn't that crazy? It retails for $50.00 and you still have to buy MORE! Don't forget the rock salt! Put everything inside, shake for about fifteen minutes..And you've just made ice cream smaller than a golf ball!This thing is horrible. Have I said that yet? I could probably do the same concept with my tupperware."
1,Beef Fat? In a Cupcake?!,I was shocked to read the ingredients of this and other Hostess products. Can anyone explain why they put beef fat in these products? I think it's disgusting - I've never seen such a thing and I'll never buy any Hostess products again.
3,Last taste of childhood,"I bought these for my better half as a reminder of days gone by. Someone else may pick up the recipie, but they will not likely taste the same..."
4,Hostess Cup Cakes,Very good! Fast delivery and overall very fresh. Great to have them one last time. If only Hostess did not go out of business.
2,Not the best ones I've tasted - Very dry,"I was disappointed to hear Hostess is closed so I quickly ordered what I could find online. Very disappointing. The cupcakes were dry and appeared to be old. Couldn't tell on the box when the expiration date was, just looked like a month and day but no year. They fell apart when you took a bite."
5,The Original Hostess Cupcake,"Delicious Hostess Chocolate Cupcakes were the first Hostess Cupcakes. You can now get orange flavored Hostess Cupcakes as well. While homemade cupcakes are still the best, if you have too little time to whip up a batch of cupcakes, when these cupcakes are fresh they are hard to beat. They have a soft, chocolate cake body with a creamy middle and chocolate icing on top. The only problem with these cupcakes is that they are addictive, and those of us who spend too little time on the treadmill need to watch home many of these things that we eat, both at one time and altogether.Well, I hear a Hostess Cupcake calling my name..."
3,Not like I remembered...,"Boohoo--everyone talks about how these really bring back memories. I thought they would invoke some of my yummy childhood days, but they were a letdown! The frosting actually peeled off in spots! The cake was a little crumbly too. My little girl tastebuds must have just had lower standards."
4,The 2nd Best in the Hostess Pantheon,"I've said it before, I'll say it again - I'm a white gal who likes to throw her ample weight around! I find these cupcakes to second only to the mighty Ding Dong when it comes to Hostess treats. The chocolate cake is great, and the frosting is absolutely delectable. Avoid the bastardization that is the golden Hostess cupcake."
3,chocolate,not so much for these. i like them okay but not a favorite. shared with family. they enjoyed them alot
3,DVD need more performances....,I wish this DVD contained a whole concert on Mary Wells!! I don't even know if there is more footage of her out there... This DVD is for Die-Hard fans ONLY!! Mary looks and sounds goods and the quality of this DVD is great! BUT warning:'Two Lovers' is not on this DVD!! they repeat 'The one who really loves you'twice which took away my enjoyment when i first viewed this.. and they could have placed the closing credits AFTER Mary finished performing 'My Guy'!.
2,compilation of earlier work but not much else,"The problem here is that almost everything in the book they have already published elsewhere, and thus only is a slight updating of earlier results. It is nice to have them altogether in one source, but the underlying methodology is so questionable as to render it not worthwhile.The empirical tests to distinguish between various models of political business cycles and partisan theory have been justly criticized. The authors could have made an important contribution by altering their work to properly incorporate the critics, but instead simply restate the problems, pay a little lip service to the issues, and then proceed to ignore them without proper justification."
4,A beautiful voice! Remarkable renditions.,"A beautiful voice! This CD will be appreciated as much by opera fanatics as by all who love beautiful songs and melodies. The piano accompaniment, which creates a more intimate sound, permits a more beautiful diffusion of the powerful voice of Garo Nichanian. The Non piu andrai (Le nozze di Figaro) of Mozart and La calumnia (Il barbiere di Siviglia) of Rossini are remarkable renditions, but the most fascinating interpretation is the Le veau d'or from Gounod's Faust.This CD invites you also to discover the richness of a repertory of Armenian music, which unfortunately is unknown to many.TMR Post, January 13, 2000"
4,"Okay book, maybe try something else","Not one of the best DK books out there, that's for sure. The previous reviewer is right, pay attention to the editor's review on amazon. It really does become tedious for an adult to read and to be honest, if you're reading it a toddler, chances are the interest is going to wan pretty quickly. The story goes from one thing to the next, explaining how each thing is done, but to the point of overdoing it. If you're looking for a book for a younger child that particularly loves trucks, then I'd definitely recommend it. But much over the age of three, you might be better served looking for one the Tonka mighty trucks books."
4,"5 Stars for Your Two-Year Old, 3 Stars for Most Adults","Most young kids who are interested in trucks will love Dig and Dug. They bumble through a variety of situations with different trucks trying to get Farmer Stubble's fruit to town. Unfortunately, Trouble with Trucks doesn't compare with toddler books like Dr. Seuss's, which parents tend to enjoy as much as their children. As a parent, the book became tedious. The Amazon Editor's review explains the shortfalls of the book aptly.If you have children between 18 months and 3 years old that enjoy trucks, they will probably find Dig and Dug amusing. If you are searching for truck & farm books for your toddler, you might want to consider adding this to their collection. Reading it as a parent, the book may not engender the same silliness and fun for you as Green Eggs and Ham or other kid's classics. But if your kids like it, why not?"
4,book,hard to review it because i have not started the book yet but excited to start. I luv john Ortberg
5,Eye Opening,A very amazing book. Took me to places I never had thought of. I was amazed and educated. I do feel I have been blessed by reading this book and I highly endorse it - all you who are seekers - give it a looksee. Candidly written. The author is brilliant.
2,scarey,"There were about 4 chapters in the book that so impressed us that we are having our grandchildren read One World. Several of the chapters read like he was on a trip . He admitted that at a younger age he had used LSD and some of his chapters read like he was having afer flashes. But he did write about things in other chapters that I wish I had know about 40 years ago so that I could have started fighting the effects sooner. Especally the education effects. The way it has been handled in the school system especially with the lack of input from the parents has been so subtle. After reading that chapter alone I have been talking with the teenagers I know, next is the Junior College students. This has to STOP. So for that chapter I want to thank Tal Brooke!!"
5,How sweet it is!!,"What can you say? If you're a Laker fan, anytime you can see a game where you beat the Celtics is enjoyable and worth it. Quality was very good considering that over 25 years have gone by. Very satisfied."
4,IT SHOULD BE ADVERTISED THAT U ONLY GET THE LAST 2 MIN OF FIRST HALF OF GAME 1!!!!!,I feel ripped off.... If I just would have been made aware of this upfront I would not be as pissd off as I am!
5,What a Team!,"Excellent games that took me back to the past and golden days of Kareem, Magic, Worthy, Rambis, Cooper and Scott"
5,Great learning book,"Read it over and over. Brought the book to a couple of my friends who dabbles in art, they thought it was fantastic.Thank you.Madeleine"
3,the cutting edge of children&#65533;s entertainment!,"Pookie the penguin and Tushka the polar bear are best friends living in a cold, cold land. Pookie sings a sad song and wishes for a happier one. Tushka has a hesitant manner and a fear of scary monsters.Through their friendship, Pookie teaches Tushka to be courageous and Tushka helps Pookie to find his happy song.This is a delightful book with beautiful illustrations. Kids will love to have it read to them over and over again. And as a parent, this is one book that won't bore you to tears.If the book is great, the enclosed CD is spectacular. Kids will love helping Pookie and Tushka build their igloo, hearing Pookie's song, and learning cool facts. The graphics are gorgeous, the music and voice-overs are enchanting, and the animation is first rate.Jorge is on the cutting edge of children's entertainment and his work is bound to win several awards in the coming years. Snap this one up so you can say you knew him when. (...)"
5,My 5 (almost 6) year old loved this.,"My little girls (5 and 3) loved this book. My 5 (almost 6 year old) got so into it and just fell for the story. It was a great read and I thought it was fun. I kinda of got into it, too."
3,Pookie and Tushka friendship,"The Pookie and Tushka friendship is well illustrated. Children hopefully would find it intriguing. I worry children might get caught up in the anxiety of their adventures and responses. I wouldn't rush to read this to a little one who is likely to be affected by the shark etc, but for older ones who are confident, yes I'd read the book to them."
2,"Not very good, I'm afraid","There are much better tutors for the English concertina out there than this, although it has to be said that these would have to be bought from the UK ...This reads to me like something knocked up in a weekend in order to earn a few bob from Hohner."
1,bad quality,"i really like the design and style of the watch, it looks great, unfortunately, it stopped working about a week after i got it, i purchased a new battery for it and it still doesnt work."
1,Not Good,"I am a low carb dieter and was worried this bread was ""to good to be true"" when I ordered it. The bread came out very bitter and I could not finish the loaf. I must admit I am not much of a cook or have much experience with baking so there is a chance the bad bread was a screw up on my part."
5,Pentax K110D SLR Review,"I found the camera very easy to use, and it took my existing Pentax 50mm standard lens and my Vivitar 70-300mm zoom lens (although I did have to program it to receive the zoom lens--which was covered in the book that came with it).And speaking of the book, read all the way through it because there are many references that bounce you non-sequentially through the manual. Then, you can go back to the parts that apply to you.There are many scenery and other photo set up selections on the dials that try to emulate using film (for us new to digital). I found some more workable than others and will probably get to a point where I use only some of the selections more than others, but I did the same with film.In short, it's a good entry in the digital arena. I like being able to take as many photos as I want (and discard some later) without worrying about film usage or wondering how the photos came out. And I was quite pleased with the price."
2,Dull - full of MBA speak.,"I really had a hard time reading this book. The writing was pendantic and full of MBA speak. The subject matter is potentially exciting and relevant to us all but the author failed to bring it to life.I would suggest that interested readers have a look Frances Cairncross's ""Company of the Future"" and magazines like ""Wired"" if they want really want to get in tune with changes that the Internet and new technologies are bringing to our world."
2,rip off,big disappointment.....no light in a laser light sword...sorry i don't get it. way over priced! half the price at walmart
2,Extremely disappointed that it does NOT light up and at that cost!,"Extremely disappointed that it does NOT light up and at that cost! It should not be called a ""LIGHT"" Saber if it does not lit up.Kids kept asking how to make it light up!"
4,"If you love Westerns, do not pass these up","This set of Westerns, while not so mainstream, are genuinely good entertainment. They are not action flicks, and will not necessarily satisfy those who are addicted to fast action shootouts, but the good guy does win, and it does feel good when he does. Acting is good, dialog is often corny, but for those who enjoy the Western stereotypical approach to drama and action will not be disappointed."
1,Not what they stated,"Well, they made it seem like this is the paperback version of the hardcover. It is NOT.This is an EXERCISE BOOK and no such description exists.Be careful when purchasing. The only version of the book itself is the hardback version costing over a hundred bucks."
4,Good Guide to Oregon,Useful information and gives more background on the state and places to visit than some other guides. Good investment when visiting the state.
1,Disappointing,"Mr. Meyer does not tell us anything new about Judy Garland. It is a short, rough read especially since the author got carried away several times with a thesaurus and used words that were more comical than literate.Yes. Judy Garland had a drug/drinking problem. But what Meyer doesn't understand is that he was an enabler in that relationship. Although he professes his hatred for the other's who catered to Judy's destructive needs, he was no better. Yet he wrote a book about it and painted himself as a hero.In all, this is a sad, pathetic attempt to turn a quick buck by using a dead celebrities known weaknesses to make money."
5,You're a fan? Buy it (again) for the CD!,"I loved the book 20 years ago and I still love it today. What makes it so good for me is the way John Meyer reproduces her way of talking. You can almost hear her.I bought it again for the CD, of course (and read it yet again). Sure, it's not a studio recording but I didn't expect a clear recording and it is better quality than I expected. I found myself smiling broadly after listening to 'I'd like to hate myself in the morning' (I love the way she ""corrects"" the line 'somehow that something' to 'that somehow something'!). She also talks a little and it's always a pleasure. Made me rush back to the recordings of the Jack Paar interviews.It's a happy recording and as always it's good to hear her. It's rare to get new stuff and just for that it would be worth 5 stars. But it is more than that, she sounds good. Thank you Mr Meyer - but why did you wait so long!"
1,awful sickening flesh peddling author,This has got to be an all-time low in memoirs or probably fabrication. Why would an ole geezer pictured on the cover want to write about graphically sex exploits with the woman he loved?What a miserable person he must be-- no wonder hardly anyone knows who he is or any of his so-called songs. Really not even worth one star.
5,I thought I knew it all...,"I thought I knew everything about Judy Garland but this book proved me wrong. I've read every book I could find and they were all very vague about the last years of Judy's life. This book shed a lot of light on that particular time and explained why all the other books were vague. If I could meet John Meyer, I'd shake his hand for having the guts to experience life with a legend and for having the guts to write about it. Thanks, John."
5,the BEST JUDY GARLAND book ever!!!!!!!,Heartfelt. Moving--- non stop; moment to moment. The most loving Judy Garland Biography out there!!!!!!!HEARTBREAKER by JOHN MEYER!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,good service,The service was prompt and the book was delivered in the condition advertised. No surprises.
4,A Complete Translation of Nagarjuna's Important Treatise,"This is one of the only available complete English translations of the ""Twelve Gate Treatise,"" which is quoted extensively in many Buddhist writings of all denominations. One of the three foundation writings of the Chinese San-lu (Japanese Sanron) sect, the ""Twelve Gate Treatise"" discusses the principle of emptiness from different viewpoints using different examples. Of special interest to Western readers is the chapter discussing the impossibility of the existence of a Creator, or supreme God. The book has a brief explanation of the history and doctrines of the Chinese San-lun sect of Buddhism, which reveres the ""Twelve Gate Treatise"" as one of its three fundamental scriptures."
5,Orpheus is indeed different,"I purchased this primarily for the Siegfried Idyll. I had heard it on the radio and marveled at the clarity of the inner voices, hearing previously unnoticed phrases. When the CD arrived, it did not disappoint."
4,A book with more guts than an abbatoir and a lot more blood,"the vatican and british royal family are engaged in a 300yr drug war and everybody's involved, FBI, IRA, HenryVII, Jesus, Paedophile preists and half-reptile royals!i bought this book as i had nothing to do whilst waiting for a bus, within the first few pages i was hooked. Udo's deranged vision left me speechless, i kept thinking ""can this be genuine?"" if you think you've read every type of book and haven't tried this yet then you'r just wrong. read this book if you want to see how the written word can be used as a blunt instrument to batter you into a daze and destroy you're cozy image of the litereray world. it proves that the written word is still the most powerful communications medium ever, freaks and misfits, this is a light in the dark."
4,500 speed cooking recipes,"I received this book as a gift a number of years ago, but I'm not quite sure why as I don't cook all that often, and had more than enough time on my hands. As one can tell from the title, it is geared towards those modern (North) Americans who are really strapped for time, but still want to cook their own meals. The cardinal sins for the traditional cook--using the microwave and canned goods--are a must for these recipes. Of course the instructions for each state that they can be made in 15 minutes or less, but seriously... who are we kidding? Cooking takes time, because there's more to cooking than just cooking. Moreover, the cooking times she suggests do little more than heat the food and give the appearance of being cooked--which compromises both flavor and quality, I think. Still, the book does have good recipes."
1,Ned and Nancy,"I think this book is really stupid. I wish that Ned and Nancy would get back together. Plus, there is hardly any mystery, just romance. I'm not reading a Nancy Drew on Campus book until Nancy and Ned get back together. This definately Carolyn Keene's worst book. The series I liked was the Nancy Drew Mystery Series."
2,Ned and Nancy belong together,I think it stinks that nancy and ned aren't together. i mean they so belong together. i hope they DO find each other again! Anyway the rest of the book is not very good. this is definitely not Keene's best work. oh well
3,I think Nancy and Ned should get back together,Honestly I have read this series from the beginning and I thought that it was cool that Nancy was branching out. But she and Ned really need to get back together because they belong with each each other. I can't wait to read the next one though.
5,THE BEST!!!!,"This is the best book I have ever read! Somehow, I knew Nancy and Michael were going to fall in love. It was so romantic how they fell in love in the barn and when Michael tried to kiss her. But when Nancy kissed him in the end, I was soooo happy! I hope it's not the end of the series. I would love to find out what happens next. Michael and Nancy are a dynamite couple! It was really funny in the books before how they always fought and argue, and in the end they fall in love. I hope there is another book coming soon in the series. This is the best book so far and I'v read every single one of the books in this series. But I love this the best!"
1,THE WORST NANCY DREW BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.,"This is the first book i have read of this series and it certanly is going to be the last. I have read almost all nancy drew stories, files and super mysteries.How could you break up nancy and ned.They are a team. Sure they have had fights before but they always make up. And it high time the did. They are a team, like fish n chips, like bed and breakfast, like monica and lewinsky. if any one out there likes ned, please don't read any books in the series. Unless and untill both of them make up. I sure hope that in no 26 they do. why doesn't nancy get transfered to emerson? i won't write more-i guess i'm too bitter but i can't help it it had me depressed for days(seriously!)"
5,Lovelyyyyy....the best ever!,"If u r a nancy drew fan like me ull love this book,,,ned and nacy went together but i dont think they were perfect but micheal and nancy are jus wonderful!i cant imagine anyone not liking this book.if u go through the pages at this site and look at the rewiews ull find out that 90% of the teens who wrote rewiews said it was marvelous....i love it!!!!!!"
2,Ned and Nancy belong together,I think it stinks that nancy and ned aren't together. i mean they so belong together. i hope they DO find each other again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway the rest of the book is not very good. this is definitely not Keene's best work. oh well
5,Great Pre-Natal Resource,I love the Pre-Natal and Newborn Baby Education System. It is a true blessing to have a system in place that I know will enhance my baby's development even before he is born. The music and Bible versus are also relaxing for me and my two-year-old. We have really enjoyed the CDs. I use to work in the field of adoption and wish that I would have had this resource at my disposal during that time period.
2,Not as great as I expected,"While the idea is great the toy just doesn't quite live up to the idea. The mat is double side and it sounds like it has tissue paper between the layers, which makes it loud and slippery. The kids have to step on the dance feet part just so or it doesn't recognize their steps. My kids play with it for just a minute or so before they get frustrated and give up"
5,Full of Life!!,"The tracks on this album are playful and joyous. There is a lot of music out there and this is one that I absolutely love putting on when the day seems a bit darker than usual. It is just so full of life!Faith, Hope and Loveis another vision of peace."
5,"Suprised, LOVED IT !!!","Not knowing what this moive was or even that it was related to a film I enjoyed many years ago (city of lost children), I picked this movie up based on the Cover alone.This movie is so wonderfully optimistic, and beautiful. The only trouble with this movie is trying to convince people I know to watch a subtitles french movie :(Its easily one of My top 10 movies of all time, oddly enough a top ten thats packed tight with much darker films (Tidus, Natural Born Killers, Akira, THX 1138) I have refered to this as the ray of sunshine in my top ten movies :)If you havent't seen this movie please watch it. I would recommend it over any other movie I have watched, because it leaves such a ""positive, warm and fuzzy"" lasting feeling after viewing."
5,Amelie,"""Amelie' is one of the best films you will see. Audrey Tatou is wonderful, cheerful, and will bring a smile or a smirk to your face.She is a bit mischievous, but with all the right reasons. You will love 'Amelie', french, with english subtitles."
5,Best film of the decade to go,"I have seen ""Amélie"" (aka Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain"" in France) last summer. At last, a movie that can be compared to Frank Capra's movies. Just see it. See it dubbed or in French, you will see the best picture of your life.Jean-Pierre Jeunet is a master at work here. Everything seems to come out from one of his perfect dreams.Don't hesitate to go see it."
5,The best Movie!,"This movie is a MUST watch and buy!! It is in my top 5 list of fav movies, and comes in 2nd place, after True Romance. My boyfriend and I watch it all the time and love seeing new things in it eachtime! It's SO AWESOME!!"
3,Amelie Angst,"Ordered three DVDs of this title, two were for presents. Viewed one and it froze at scene section 16. Viewed the other two and had the same freeze, but one jumped to section 17, so not much lost. Subsequent DVD's played fine- so it wasn't the player. Returned all three Amelie's for full credit--received in less than a week. What if I hadn't viewed the film, though? The presents would have been disappointing."
4,Classic romance,"If you're not sick of Audrey Tautou (early this Century, it seemed to me that she was the ONLY actress to come from France) you definitely have to watch this movie."
3,An Indy film lovers wet dream,"This film was artistic and enjoyable. If you don't want to read subtitles then you better know French. The main character of the film is an oddball who is also pretty easy to relate to. I really liked the movie, but I'm not sure I'd watch it again. One time was plenty for me."
1,CATHOLICS PLEASE READ,"This movie insults the Blessed Mother, in that it is stated one character, ""hates the phrase; fruit of Thy womb."" Anatomical drawings of the uterus, etc. are interspersed with Marian images. It's really pitiful the director felt the necessity to take a cheap stab at others' beliefs."
5,Amelie,"This movie is splendid! It is entertaining, and the main character played by Audrey Tautou is clever, original, heartwarming, and deserving of happiness, love, compasion, and everything meant by the phrase ""Joy of Life!."" I enjoyed it thoroughly, and laughed out loud many times. It is a marvelous distraction, and a fulfilling way to spend a little time, especially with someone you really like!"
4,Sweet Movie!,"I love French movie and this one was fun to watch and to see all the beautiful Paris atmosphere. The one who play Amélie Poulin give a great acting performance, also all the actors in this movie give a good and fun to watch performance. It's a sweet and lovely movie to see."
5,Great movie!,"Any movie with a suicidal goldfish has my attention. Seriously though, this movie is great from start to finish. Thankfully this movie was not dubbed for American audiences. Just buy it."
4,"Really very good, but ....","This is an excellent, intelligent and entertaining film.However, the love interest in the last third of the film annoyed me and it bothered me that Audrey Tautou would get involved with such an obvious nerd. Of course, the character Amélie is something of a nerd herself, but a very endearing and wonderful nerd. The guy she starts searching for is just a nerd.The first two thirds of this film are as good as any film can ever get.Audrey Tautou is great in the role of Amélie and it is, no doubt, a role which she will be remembered for, for many years to come."
5,"See Amelie, go to Paris, enjoy life....!!!","One of the best films I have ever seen and probably will see, it's a totally new experience. Enjoy seeing Paris locations that you would like to be there now.The DVD is a great acquisition. - trustme -"
2,Why not for everyone?,"I rented this movie with high hopes. And in many ways it did deliver. The cinematography is fantastic. The storyline is certainly fanciful and charming. Audrey Tautou is gorgeous and well cast for this film. It had everything I look for in a movie. For all of these I give 5 stars.The disappointment for me is the fact that this is not a movie I can share with my kids, (ages 17,15,12). This is the type of film I would like to foster an appreciation for in my kids, but I can't own it. Why?... The sexual content is extreme by even liberal accounts. Over the top... the most sexual R rated movie I have ever seen. There seems to be no need for such extreme sexuality in this storyline. I would love for film makers to understand the importance of making artful presentations for everyone. I think our society could benefit greatly by such imagination, and good hearted humor. Give me the PG version of Amelie any day."
2,So dang cute I can't stand it,"Well, I suppose the people who love this film about an impish gamine pixie and the ones who don't will just have to agree to disagree. While many feel that director Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays a light, joyful touch in this film, I felt that he was trying to cram his sense of whimsy down my throat and I couldn't help gagging on it. When I feel that my life is lacking in cuteness, I have some pictures of kittens sitting in baskets that I can look at instead of spending a couple of hours with this film.But then, I don't like ""E.T."" either, so clearly I am out of step with what warms the cockles of most movie-goers' hearts. So bear that in mind when you are deciding whether to pay attention to this review."
3,Cute but creepy.,"This movie is shot beautifully, and is very cute,but the main character is a stalker.The film tries to pass off Amelie's behavioras socially acceptable and unthreatening,even romantic and charming,but the movie only works becauseAudrey Tautou is so cute.While watching this movie in the theater,I had to constantly repress the urge to yell""Run! Run away! Get away from her! Fast!""at the romantic male lead."
3,Vive Amelie!,"Shining in a role that more than slightly resembles Audrey Hepburn, Audrey Tatou is sweet, flighty and more than a little devious. Amelie is a lonely waitress at a local bar/tabac in the Montmartre section of Paris. After the death of Princess Diana of Wales, she discovers a box of 'treasures' that once belonged to the little boy who lived in her apartment years before. Embarking on a 'quest', she reunites the now grown man with his childhood and is prompted to 'right other wrongs', eventually learning the difference between living and existing."
2,Kinda dumb,"I really didn't see what all the hype was about. This was way too cutsie for me. There were some funny parts, not that many."
2,I'm not 100%,"But I think this was a copy of a DVD. I'm probably 90% sure. It looks like a fairly well made copy, but still, it's a copy. And I'm pretty sure that's illegal."
5,Great movie,"This is a great foreign film, probably my second favorite (First being Run Lola Run) Amelie is absolutely adorable! You can watch it with english audio also so that you don't have to watch the movie and read the subtitles at the same time. worth watching."
5,Amelie!,"I loved this movie! But the only parts I did not like was the ones with all the sex. That was a little too much for me to handle. Overall, it's very good. The colors are vivid, the actors and actresses can communicate really well with one another."
1,Overrated,"Amelie was a big disappointment to me. The story started off very strongly and I was looking forward to seeing the rest of this film. However, after everybody telling me to watch this film, I did and thought that it is vastly overrated. Maybe, I thought this film and the main character would be 'deeper' than it was. This film is basically a film about how a boy gets to go out with a girl - as simple and as predictable as that."
1,YAWN!,Now I am ready for beddy bye. I gave it 45 minutes of my time. I was bored from the start. Very odd movie. One of the first irritating things about the movie was the constant narration. I suppose the movie is supposed to be funny. I did not laugh!I did not find anything enjoyable about the film. I also could not watch the Royal Tennenbaums. Although the stories are different the films both have the narration and odd characters. Just not my thing I guess!
4,Wacky and Wonderful,"Wow-those french really know how to make movies. I saw this one at the Paris Theatre in NYC and it was fabulous. The plot is a bit wacky and insane but the outcome is heartwarming and wonderful. A simple, young, brilliant girl in many ways, Amelie knows just enough how to meddle in the lives of others to make a difference, and all for the better. The challenge for her, of course, is to be able to help herself. She seems really good at running away until the end-alas,a nice ending. Oh, and the scenes with the gnome are an absolute scream!"
5,"in the name of all that is holy and beautiful, see this movie","So many times, the underdog or oddball character in a movie is presented as cynical, dark, and misunderstood (think enid from ghost world.) And although you LOVE the oddball character, sometimes you find him or her hateful in most movies. Sometimes even you, cynical as hell, want to shout at this character, ""Hey, life's not so bad."" Amelie, on the other hand, is the most lovable oddball ever presented on screen. You are always rooting for her, never doubting her judge of character.Some people have written that this movie is too sweet. But who hasn't felt the pang in your stomach when you have an attraction, or ""affinity,"" with someone? Who hasn't struggled to tell someone they had a crush on that they were interested? This movie perfectly captures the shyness that comes with confessing love.This movie is about love, honesty, and finding yourself. You deserve all these things--and you deserve to see this movie."
4,"Fun, sweet movie","I really enjoyed Amelie. It was a fun sweet romance movie with a few twists. Compared to the standard Hollywood pacing, it feels a bit slow and plodding in some spots, but the quirkiness of the side plots help keep the entertainment coming. This film though about the modern world of real people is full of fantastic little touches made possible with great cinematography and rich special effects.My only complaint isn't about the movie itself, but about the DVD. The DVD is in French, with the option to have English and Spanish subtitles. Loathe as I am sometimes to listen to overdubbed movies,I wish this DVD had the English overdub option. Reading the subtitles is a distraction from the beautiful filmwork and actors subtle visual performances.I give the DVD 4 stars, and the movie itself, 5. It may not be for everyone (my wife slept most of the way through) but fans of foreign films and independent movies may greatly enjoy it."
5,"Excellent, creative, stunning and lovely......","This is the most creative and lovely movie I have ever seen. Stunning, funny and lovely to watch. This is a MUST see movie!!Bravo to all involved in its making. My husband and I walked out of the movie theater saying we will buy it the minute it comes out on DVD, a definate must see and must have for the home movie collection."
5,Very Surprised,"I'm not a fan of foreign film or any kind of ""artsy"" film in general. I like movies where things blow up, killers with hockey masks wield machete's, or elves, dwarves, and men take on the ultimate evil from Mordor. Not to mention the boy who lived, the one who must take on Mr. Smith, or heroes in spandex.So when my wife all but twisted my arm to watch this film for our movie night, I wanted to hate this film. I frowned and nearly threw a tantrum prior to cueing the movie. I'm glad I did!This movie was awesome. No explosions, no heroes, and no horcruxes or elves, but funny, full of charm, and capable to convert even the most ardent slasher film nut into a fan.I can't imagine a soul on Earth who wouldn't like this movie once they make the decision through choice or spousal force to watch."
5,Kookie Masterpiece,"Ive only rented this - so on dvd features i cannot comment. However, the film is a modern classic. It has beautiful direction, in depth characterisation, whilst being funny and engaging. Truely a worthwhile watch."
5,Beautiful!,"This is probably my favorite movie of all time. The colors that are chosen are very beautiful, it seems as if everything has a greenish tint which is really interesting. The music in this movie is incredibly beautiful, and is quite possibly the best soundtrack ever made. The movie itself is just plain fun! I usually despise romantic comedies, but if thats what you want to call this movie (it really bridges the gap between genres but..), this is an exception. The first 10 minutes are just brief character synopsis, and you will find how quirky and fun this movie is right from the start (the suicidal fish! I love it!) I'd have to say the BEST part of this movie, though, is the garden gnome! The DVD also has the original language track in Parisian French which is interesting to listen to. Such an amazing movie! I would highly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to deal with a little bit of sex."
1,Blank dvd disc,"So, this dvd will not play on two different dvd players, nor on the computer's player. Thanks for sending me a blank copy."
1,"Great Movie, but Copy Protection Makes it Unplayable","I've updated my firmware and software, but still this blu-ray won't play. All my other blu-rays play fine.It's a shame because I was really hoping to appreciate the beautiful cinematography in high quality. I got it on sale for $9, so it's not worth my time to return. Very disappointed, though."
2,Sacre Bleu!,"""Amelie"" is fun and sweet and entertaining. There are some nice touches, but overall, it's too just too cutesy. The film is this year's ""Chocolat."" In fact, although this is a 'French' film, it's more like a mainstream film with subtitles."
1,...And now a word from our sponsor...,"Take the most artsy-fartsy, self-consciously cute-as-a-bug 30-second television commercial past which you've ever fast-forwarded. Multiply it by 180 or so. Add subtitles. Sound good to you? Then ""Amelie"" is definitely up your quaint ""Franche"" alley. Me, I'm sticking with the substance and grit of my deluxe widescreen DVD of the complete ""Snuggles the Fabric Softener Bear"" commercials...."
4,"Unique, Different, and Good Movie",This movie is a good movie in its own way. Shows the life of Amelie and how she tries to help others when she should try to fix her own life first. Funny movie but some inappropriate parts about sex and orgasms.
5,"Amelie' a cute, sort of twisted, nice movie","While not necessarily for underage viewers, Amelie is a fun and sort of twisted refreshing type of film. It is in French with English subtitles, but I hardly noticed because it is such a great film. It's cute and Amelie' is a do-gooder who has a nice openness to her while still remaining mysterious to the people she does good for. It's one of my favorite movies."
3,Interesting but psychadelic,"This film is interesting, and really unusual, you loose all you references when you start seeing it, the negative point about it is that it is a bit psychadelic, you don't really understand what is happening, you ar taken in to a irrealistic and ideal world, where everything is good."
5,So SWeeT! i CouLD GoBBLe HeR uP!!!,So BeauTiFuL!So HiLaRiouS!So DeLiCiouS!So DeLiGHTFuL!So eNCHaNTiNG!So NiFTy-NeaT!
3,WHERE IS LOUISE BROOKS?,"Splendid kooky MTV photography and Louise Brooks look-alike Audrey Tautou launch this zippy paen to love and Paris. It's too long, but the green colors are cool. It does seem like somethings missing."
2,I really really tried to like it,"What is up with all the fuss? The fan-club reviews here have me all excited before I watched it. It did nothing for me. Didn't inspire me. Didn't make me laugh. Didn't make me think. Didn't entertain me. I did like the green and beautiful scenery and the cute girl. Except for that scene where the little girl kept messing with the tv antenna to get back at the person who made her believe she was responsible to all those car crashes by taking pictures with her camera, the movie did not have any other funny moment. It's not for me. Please wake me up when it's over. Thanks."
5,AMOUR FOR AMELIE,"THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN MANY YEARS...MAYBE EVEN IN MY LIFE. WHAT A BEAUTIFUL STORY,TOLD IN A CREATIVE AND ORIGINAL WAY. AMALIE IS A YOUNG WOMAN IN PARIS WHO LIVED A SOLITARY LIFE DUE TO HER FATHER'S MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT SHE HAD A HEART CONDITION AS A CHILD. ONE DAY THROUGH A TWIST OF FATE SHE REALIZES SHE CAN BRING HAPPINESS TO OTHERS AND SETS OUT TO DO SO, IN QUIRKY BUT EFFECTIVE WAYS. WITH JUST THE RIGHT TOUCH OF MISCHIEF, SHE TRANSFORMS THE PEOPLE AROUND HER, AND BEGINS TO SEEK HER OWN HAPPINESS AS WELL. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE ORIGINAL PHOTOGRAPHY AND ART DIRECTION. VERY WELL DONE! THANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE!"
5,Amazing,"Everything in this movie is perfectly done. All the different aspects of the film come together to form a great story. I have watched this movie multiple times. In English and French, with and w/o directors commentary. Everything from costume design, music, story to directing is amazing. The director points out in the commentary what he thinks are his mistakes yet you could easily not view them as mistakes even knowing. Amazing use of color and lighting with the small touch of visual effects it truly completes the story."
5,Great movie,"Funny, charming, and an overall great movie! The subtitles aren't a distraction like some subtitled films. I highly recommend this film."
5,"Subtle, at times hilarious and touching. Great entertainment.",A film about the anomie and search for meaning and happiness in a modern urban setting. Many excellent character studies by supporting cast and the tale of Amelie at it's core. Audrey Tautou is remarkable and possessor of probably the most mischievous grin in captivity. Great Parisian locations and a plot that moves along nicely. I chose Blu-ray version for better picture detail and durability because I will probably watch this film many times. There is more to this film than just the humor but even on that level alone it is exceptional.
3,It's worth watching once,"I found Amelie a little too contrived. To me, the plot was improbable, but it was fun to watch it once."
5,MY MOST FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"AMELIE IS THE BEST!!!! Craving a trip to Paris? Yearning to sip a latte on the Champs Elysees? Wishing you could wander the metro? Bank account statement say ""$0""? Well have no fear! Watch Amelie!!! It's the closest to ""being there"". Best way to escape to Paris for the evening without leaving your couch!!! Bon Voyage!!!!"
5,Kisses to the creators!,"No, this film is not about a girl who finds love! Forget about the plot, listen to that mild humor, the words... To me this film is more about a cat, the smell in the air, music in your mind, sugar on the table...All those details that make the film so close and real is what I always missed watching oh so many other good films. That`s why it`s the best antidepressant for me, it brings comfort to your life doesn`t matter how you feel. Besides everyone is just so adorable there... :)"
3,"Great film, disappointing packaging for a DVD","I bought the DVD because the film is EXCELLENT. I would have given this 5 stars, except for the following things regarding the DVD production:1. There is neither English dubbing nor subtitles (THIS IS WHAT DVD IS ALL ABOUT), whereas I'm certain at least the latter was done for the film in the theaters. The interviews with the director are less important, and I didn't find them all that interesting anyway.2. There is advertisement for wines (I won't mention the name) throughout different parts of the CD (not during the film, thank goodness). For example, on my CD player I can't interrupt the opening commercial. Impossible to jump to the title screen. I'm obliged to watch it all the way until menu comes up.It's a shame that for such a good movie they had to package it so poorly."
1,too sweet,"This is a romantic comedy (aka chick flick) with extra sugar added in. By the virtue of being foreign, it is more interesting and refreshing than the usual Julia Roberts movies.Yet it is even cuter, and much more childish. It has some sickly sweet quality that is hard to describe. It is a long movie where tiny little cute things happen, and Amelie just blinks with her huge eyes. This is like a funnier version of the movie Magnolia - but still there is something not-so-subtly depressing about those childishly naive and one-sided characters.I went to see a movie that I had hears was good, but neither me nor my date liked it. What astounded me is that later it grew more and more famous and hyped up, and all of my friends like it!By the way, camera work, colors, imagery are very good. But not outstanding enough to make the entire movie worth watching."
1,Very displeased!,It received rather slowly compared to other items purchased. Dvd doesn't work at all! Very frustrated! Dvd appears to be defective. Disappointing!
1,Boring Boring Boring,Did I mention it is boring. BTW you must also speak French to fully appreciate how boring this movie is. It may just be a joke on the Americans.
3,Amelie - will haunt you in your luscious dreams,"Enter the world of Amelie, a mentally unstable French woman who suffers from drug-induced hallucinations and anorexia. Follow her as she enters on a death-defying journey through the seedy underbelly of post-Cold War Paris, where she haunts sex shops by night and wanders the streets stalking an innocent boy named Nino, a drug addict and loner who works in the underground Parisian sex industry. Amelie, a chronic liar and psychopath, breaks into people's apartments and decieves them, playing cruel tricks that will make you want to hate her. Due to an abusive relationship with her father, Amelie embarks on a self-destructive downward spiral of sex, drugs, and alcohol. A riveting film that ranks with ""Tron"" as one of the most powerful films of our generation. 5 stars!"
5,Amelie is the best movie ever created,"Of all of the movies i've seen, this would have to be the the best one ever. I love this movie; the actors are wonderful, it is beautifully directed, and the story is outstanding. If i could only own one movie, this one would be it."
4,"I love the movie and I knew that the box would be slightly damaged, the dvd was in good condition","Amelie is a french movie (with subtitles) it is a lovely story of a young, lonely woman with a lot of imagination. It is a lovestory."
3,I was not impressed.,Actually I didn't mind the subtitles but reviews were somewhat hyped up more than I felt was right. It had some fun and quirkey mini plots.
5,GREAT,"Should have won the oscar for the best foreign movie anyday. Should have won the oscar for the best movie, even without being nominated. Great great movie, love that guy Jean-Pierre Jeunet. All his have been great till date."
5,Refreshing comedy/ lovestory,don't mind that it is in french subtitles. it is a cute lovestory and leaves you feeling refreshed. it is upsetting that Amelie didn't get more awards.
3,Very watchable,"It's a fine movie. It's not ""5 Acadmy Award Nominations!"" fine the way the DVD cover blasts at you, but it's a fine movie. Unique color scheme, a wry dry narrative wit that I love, and an allegorical tale that doesn't forget the importance of character development or plot the way that most allegories do. It moves at a nice fast pace, and both narrative and dialogue were written by someone who cares about the words. Maybe it's a little twee, but so what? I recommend it. It's miscast as a comedy, but it is funny, and it doesn't really fit comfortably into any genre, so what the heck, call it a comedy and enjoy it."
3,Rent it first,"This movie is good, but I don't see myself watching it again. I should have just rented it."
4,"Weak endind, good story telling","Very French style movie making, excellent story telling. A little weak at the ending. The conversation is well written and the plot is well thought out."
5,Amazing,"I always get lost in this movie, this movie is actually amazing and will transport you to a new world :D"
5,Cooky and Funny,"Amelie is a cooky, funny and entertaining movie. The various subplots help the entire movie come together and make it special and sweet. If you don't speak Frencch you must pay attention to the subtitles otherwise you can miss important points in the movie."
3,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An overrated and inexplicably-beloved film that tries to hide the fact that it's a fundamentally ordinary movie (odd but lovable couple kept apart by contrivances until the final scene) behind layers of sugary schmaltz, watching Amelie is the cinematic equivalent of eating cotton candy till you're stuffed."
3,whimsy or another commonplace of love quest?,"the movie remains to be a touching movie until she started to seek for her truth love. a commonplace of love quest which can only be achieved by your first courageous step. however the movie is stunning with the colour-saturated mise en scene and the pretty actress, audrey tautou."
2,Cookie-cutter Chick Flick,"If this was a US movie it would have been lost among the other chick flicks but because its French we are supposed to act like its above the rest. I thought they tried too hard to make Amelie likable so it ended up making her really annoying. The love story was totally Hollywood style pipe dream take on love but based on two freaks finding each other, both of whom I couldn't care less about.On the other hand, the supporting characters were interesting and provided some funny scenes so I'm giving it two stars for that. But otherwise this was rubbish."
2,French cinema for the MTV Generation,"Yes the visual style is interesting though overdone but far more time was spent on the look of the film than the actual content. I'm not so sure what is charming about Amelie or her eventual relationship with the porn shop worker, the bad comedy about Princess Di or sneaking into someone's house and making them go insane - the director spent so much time trying to make everyone ""quirky"" that they are just caricatures."
5,Great movie and cool DVD case!,"This is a light-hearted and fun movie, and the DVD and case are uniquely designed and packaged. You get two DVD's in a special cardboard case, which has a nice slip cover. Good product all around."
5,"Fresh, and Inspiring.","Amelie is one of the most creative, and inspiring films I have seen in a while. Beautifully filmed, and with a great cast, Amelie is an optimistic love story. Audrey Tautou gave a great performance, and so did the other cast members. My favorite character is the garden gnome. Watch it, and you'll see. I highly recommend this film!"
5,Excellent!,"I really became a big fan of foreign films after seeing ""Amelie"", and this was indeed a great film to be ""initiated"" by!The movie is well-written, showing an equal affinity for the funny and touching sides of life, and Audrey Tautou gives a marvelous performance. Tautou is almost a dead-ringer for Audrey Hepburn physically as well as in her performance.This film as well as ""Bread & Tulips"" and the recent Jet Li film ""Hero"" are my choices for the best foreign films I have ever seen. If you're a fan of romantic comedies, you will love ""Amelie"", the language barrier notwithstanding. Highly recommended, buy it!"
5,Its a damn good movie,"Not the usual type of movie i go for, but i watched this movie in on of my french classes, and it blew me away. The story is pretty good, the acting is terrific, and the cinematography was probably the best ive ever seen.There are quite a few sacks on here that rate the movie lowly, but after reading most of the their reviews its because they cant handle watching a subtitled film, so my recommendation is this, if you dont know how to watch a movie and watch the subtitles dont bother watching it because you simply wont like the film, but if you arent a complete moron and can handle reading something, watch it. Its an outstanding movie."
5,Must See,"I saw this with a friend in Paris. While it was a little difficult to keep up with the full-speed French, this was truly a delightful film. Without giving anything away, Amelie is one of the sweetest women you'll ever see on screen --- most of the time. This is a charming portrait of a normal woman breaking out of the mundane, digging up her courage, and living -- really living."
5,AMAZING French Film!!!,"I saw this film on one of my last days studying abroad in Besanon, France, and it changed my LIFE! Amelie is an awe inspiring character, who brings love, joy, and LIFE to the screen. It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made me THINK. I loved it, and I can't wait until it's here, so I can share it with my friends and family!"
5,Perfect in every way!,"I won't repeat what the other reviewers have so accurately said. I'm only going to say that it is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen and Audrey Tautau is sensational as Amelie. She is simply wonderful and this film has become one of my all-time favourites. Buy it, watch it you won't be disappointed. It is absolutely perfect."
1,Foreign Film,"Not really into films that are in languages I don't understand. There were subtitles, but my DARN TV wasn't formatting the video properly so the subtitles were partially cut off. Frustrating.As a result, the movie frustrated me and I couldn't even finish watching it. Luckily, I rented two movies. I also got ""Are We There Yet?"" with Ice Cube. Highly recommend it."
3,"""It's better to help people than garden gnomes.""","It is not that I don't like 'Amelie' and don't appreciate its charm and whimsy - I am yet to see the streets of Montmartre, Paris as magic as in the movie, and I've been to Paris and found it the most beautiful place in the world. It is that I don't find it fabulous, amazing, and original enough to grant its status of one of the greatest movies ever made according the multiple top lists. One of the IMDB reviewers described ""Amelie"" the best: ""sweet, sweet, sweet"" - and that triple sweetness was a bit too much for my taste, I guess. I found it amusing and very good looking but the story of a naive shy young girl who found her destiny in making people around her happy by helping them find love and while doing so, finding her own love, as sweet as it sounds, left me indifferent. To sum up, for me, ""Amelie"" is a pleasant little movie but not a timeless masterpiece which would stay in my memory for long time."
3,great film,This was a great film with great cinematography. I highly reccomend it to those interested is learning anything about the french culture.
3,See a Dentist After,"Last things first, this DVD had its subtitles prepared by a ""closed-captioning"" institute - you know, for the hearing-impaired? If the hearing-impaired could hear the discrepancy between the spoken French and the English subtitles, they would scream. And since there is ALOT of dialogue and narration in this film, there is ALOT of subtitling.Otherwise the film is harmless (perhaps too harmless) fun. Poor Audrey Tautou was compared (only because she had the same prenom) to Audrey Hepburn. While not equalling her in looks, Mlle Tautou is at least a better actress. The sepia-stained cinematography of Paris is, however, glorious. And the film has something conspicuously lacking lately - genuine charm (in moments).Overall, my advice is to learn French and turn OFF the subtitles. Since the star-rating system limits me to choosing between ""I Liked it"" or ""I Liked It Alot"", I went for the former. I DID like it!"
5,wonderful,"This is a wonderful film. Though this film has many special effects and an interesting directing style, it is the acting, the writing, and the solid direction that make it a classic. I especially enjoyed the character writing for the characters at the cafe where Amelie works! The techniques and especially the unconventional special effects that the director use may remind you of ""Moulin Rounge"". Not only do we see Amelie and her life, we see her mind too thru floating images of Amelie's thoughts that hover on the side of the screen. At first, I was afraid the director would overuse these techniques. Hapily, these images always had purpose in showing the impish nature of Amelie, and always made me laugh!This movie was wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone. As for adult content, yes it has it, but nothing that an adult should be offended by... What more is there to say?"
5,So Cute It's Scary,"Amelie is unlike anything I have ever seen, and after seeing this directors work in City of the Lost Children, thats a big statement. Amelie is about a young girl (Audrey Tautou) who's key to life is by making others see the beauty that they never can see themselves, here eventful encounters with many unique characters bring her to a romance with a mysterious man who's hobby is collection torn pictures throw in the trash next to photo booths. The movie is so utterly adorable it makes viewers blush with how cute and charming it is, and it doesn't hurt that Audrey Tautou is the cutest actress today complete with her little grin. I was smiling the entire way through, Amelie is a beautiful film please don't miss it!"
4,Beautiful,"A beautiful story interwoven by a number of small lovely episodes that happened to a sales lady in France about her job, her roommate, her love and above all, the force of chance. Picture quality is very impressing and the analytical depiction of the characters very vivid. Great settings. Great fun to watch."
1,a stinker like the streets of paris,"What could be more irritating than a shy busy body who's idea of happiness is manipulating peoples interaction with each other. God help us if Amelie was a male, any number of stalking laws may be seen as violated. If you want want you French movie experience to be all quaint streets, homely cafes, street markets and bagettes then enjoy all the cliches this fantasy has to offer. My jaded memory of Paris is still the smell of dog poop on the streets and $6 coffees (and that was in the 80's)."
3,"Try Delicatessen, or 'Cinema Paradiso' instead","Given that 'Delicatessen' is one of the best films ever made on any planet, 'Amelie' is a little bit of a disappointment, to understate the case somewhat.Watching it is like comparing Spielberg's 'Hook', with 'Duel', Scorsese's 'Casino' with 'Taxi Driver', or Coppola's 'Godfather 3' with, er . . . 'Godfather'. Yet another director who has flattered with their cinematic talents only to deceive us with sub-standard pap, once they have made a name for themselves.OK, that may be a little harsh - after all, Audrey Tatou is heart-stoppingly cute, and yes, this is several trillion times better than the usual tripe that makes it to your local multiplex. But I defy you to feel a massive tinge of disappointment, if you watch this back-to-back with Delicatessen, or even New Cinema Paradiso."
3,"really, what's so great about this?","Its quirky and pretty and all, but then it turns into a typical love story in the end. Dissapointing, I would rather it be a film where she makes everyones lives nicer, and this importance isn't placed on her Only Being Happy If She Gets The Guy. The actress is really pretty, there are nice scenes and ideas, parts are funny, but I don't understand why it has this cult status."
5,A breat of fresh air,"One of the most beautiful films I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, Amelie captures the audience's hearts and minds from the very start. It draws attention to life's subtle yet moving moments and combines it with simple every day events that many of us have grown numb to in our hectic modern day lives. Set in the Monmartre district of Paris, Amelie is essentially a story about a shy, reserved and somewhat eccentric young girl who convinces herself that her mission on this planet is to help people, and so she sets out to do just that. At the same time, she finds herself falling in love with an equally quirky character who collects discarded photographs lying around photo booths. Fabulous escapism that's a breath of fresh air to watch and so different from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood movies of late where the actors and titles change, but the movies remain so similar."
5,Funny,I have seen this too many times. It is so cute and funny. Amelie is an intriguing character that draws you into her world and leaves you wanting more.
4,Nouvelle CGI Vague,"We are now entering a great age of movie making. Computer-generated special effects have become so accessible that even European Cinema can afford them. Since the good people in Hollywood can't write a decent script to save their lives, and can not imagine a use for CGI other than blowing things up, we must now look elsewhere for our films. Amelie is just a fun movie - a sweet romantic comedy from beginning to end. In this film, the special effects act as surreal compliments to the story - more Jean Cocteau than Jerry Bruckheimer. In the scene where Amelie gets her heart broken, she simply melts into water. The story, such as it is, basically concerns her fear of meeting the man she has a crush on from afar...or maybe it's about the things a woman does to amuse herself if she's never had a fulfilling sexual encounter? (How many couples ARE having sex right now? Only 15?) It's not really about the plot - it's simply a fun, good-hearted adventure with a lot of quirky people."
2,Too self-consciously cute for words,"This movie exudes the sort of Gallic charm that only the French can produce. It would work better if it weren't so long and if the endless concoction of self-conscious contrivances were not so tedious. Undeniably this movie has its moments, primarily thanks to Audrey Tatou, but in the end it's just tiresome."
2,Valuable lessons that I have learned,"If you have children, show them affection and attention and never home school an only child. Otherwise they will end up socially inadequate self isolated individuals who delight in lying, stealing, breaking and entering, causing physical and emotional harm to others, and other assorted felonies and misdemeanors.I do not know what types of laws that they have in France, but here in the United States, there would be enough evidence for her to stand trial.I do not celebrate her, or this movie. I pity both. My rating is 1.5 stars. That is only because I have a soft spot for gnomes. :)"
2,"Didnt like this one, but someone else obviously does","I like quirky movies and I am an open minded person. However, I thought this movie sucked. Maybe because I was reading French for two hours at one o clock in the morning. I thought that the characters were very bizarre, and Amelie couldn't seem to make up her mind about some things that were quite obvious to the viewer. I heard that this was a romantic and fairy tale like movie. If that is what youre looking for, I'd check out chocolat. The characters are wonderful, johnny depp is totally hot in it, and it has a nice story line."
2,Amélie,"Amélie was recommended to me by a French girl as a truly magical movie. Now, I've seen more than my ration of French Movies. Generally French movies meander aimlessly for 90 to 120 minutes then end abruptly. Script seems to be written only after the consumption of copious amounts of wine. And distilled water would make a far stronger plot. This is not simply my opinion, it's a proven scientific fact. Amélie was no exception. Absolutely typical of the French ideas of love and romance. The neurotic and frankly insane methods, which she uses to TRAP her romantic interest, were so ridiculously contrived that I just wanted to hit the television with a baseball bat. Oh GOD, why didn't I listen to my own gut and avoid that festering pile of garbage! From now on I'll think very carefully before approaching another mainstream French movie."
5,Love this movie!,"This must be one of the cutest, best made movies I have seen in the last few years. I cannot believe it took me so long to hear about it..."
5,Puts a smile on your face,"I couldn't understand how a person would not enjoy this film, but I imagine they're out there. It's a completely upbeat film with a ton of heart and brilliantly written characters. I have no bad things to say about this... honestly, it's a very unique masterpiece. Watch it if you ever need to be in a feel good mood."
5,This is already an evergreen,"This masterpiece of cinematografy is destined to become an evergreen. In a hundred years ppl will still speak enthusiastically about this marvelous film.One odd detail:There is not a single cussword in the whole movie, a brief moment of nudity maybe but that is all. It is refreshing to find a gem like this for a change."
4,Lovely Read,"With the huge uptick in books about walks, hikes, pilgrimages and so on, it is wonderful to read Muir's journals with their elegant language, keen eye, and love of nature. It is also a real treat to see the country as it was in times past with much of nature unspoiled. His take on people is as astute as his description of plants. Good book. Peaceful and exciting at the same time."
3,It works but...,"This charger is the real deal, however, the AC line cord with it was not for this unit. The 2-pin end of the cord that goes into the charger is supposed to be rounded on both sides- the one that it came with was round on one side and square on the other. With enough force it would work, but to make things easier I took a file to the square side to make it round and all is well."
5,Best Strategic Game Ever Made,"Simply put, it's the best strategic game made. Little is based on luck (certain pieces will help, but everyone get's a pretty even share) and the rest is based on strategy. A little like risk, but without the luck of the dice. Another great aspect of it, is unlike some of the other games, there are numerous way you can win. Some will try and get the most stock in the biggest chain, some will nickle and dime there way to the finish, and still others with ride a hotel chain for three to four takeovers.I only have the older versions bought on ebay, but I will be getting one from amazon shortly. If you like a game that will not last over an hour, allow all players to finish at the same time, and be difficult enough to hold your attention game after game for years to come, then buy Acquire."
5,A gift for my son.,He was pretty excited about getting this new game as he thought they were out of print and it was a nice edition.
3,Classic movie,"I seen this movie several of times and it never disappointment me to keep looking at the spoofs of all the high school drama movies and The Deer Hunter blended into one section. It a total classic and enjoy it too much. This movie should have deserve at least an award, sure people may see it as an underrated film but it wasn't so bad after all."
2,Jon Lovitz sizzles.,"This erotic thriller takes you from the classroom to the bathroom with Jon Lovitz's steamy sultry exotic body and Tia Carrera's dramatic reprise. This is a must see for anyone who likes thrilling films such as ""Skyscraper"" and ""The Godfather""."
1,This movie is WAY too exagerated,"Like I said, this movie is the worst. The overexagerated sterotypes of High School are almost insulting. I think what happened is that someone saw National Lampoon's Senior Trip, thought it was good, and made a bad opposite of it. If you liked Senior Trip, you will probably hate this movie."
1,"Dumb! Dumb, and Dumber","It's too bad that you don't have negative ratings, because I would give this film a negative five. Absolutely the worst movie ever made. Mekhi Phifer is one of my favorite character actors, and to have him cast in a movie of this low caliber is just regretable. The stereotypical humor was insulting and was not funny. The only thing keeping me from rating this film below a negative five is the fact that the sound and picture quality are good."
5,Exaggerated but very funny,"I love this movie. As a high school teacher with the Los Angeles Unified School District, I can say that much of the student behavior the movie portrays is greatly exaggerated, but that is strictly for humor. For example, the scene where Lovitz drives up in front of the school and a bomb explodes on the second floor and blows out several windows. I find that hilarious, but I doubt that ever occurred in a LAUSD school. Also, Lovitz's jacket completely covered with gum wads thrown by his students is over the top, BUT one semester I had to use a math teacher's room for one period, and I noticed that the top half of the wall in the front of the class was similarly coated with gum wads. I beleive the movie's purpose is to skewer the feel-good teen movies like ""Stand and Deliver,"" which I also enjoy. If you enjoy high-school genre movies, I would also recommend ""Lean on Me"" (based on a true story), and Dangerous Minds."
4,Very original gags,"Although I go for cheap, chessy comedies too, this movies is NONE of that. The gags are clever and unpredictable, and the acting, especially by Lovitz and Carrere, is superb. Comedy is always hard, especially if one is doing comedy about potentially sensitive issues (e.g. rough high schools). ""High School High"" succeeds at making one laugh while not offending anyone."
2,Only funny if you're high.,"I used to think that John Lovitz was funny (see The Critic and SNL) but after this I felt that he wasn't at all, or he must've been desperate for money. Tia Carrerre did a wonderful job playing an talentless teacher. After such wonderful performances as the bad girl in True Lies, and the naked chick in Rising Sun, I was surprised at how little cleavage she showed in this movie. If you find stupid humor funny, than this movie is for you. Oh, and please wait for things to come out on video if you do like this, because Hollywood producers see the money that terrible unfunny films make and decide to make more of them (like every teen-highschool-angstridden-SarahMicheleGellar-film)"
2,I thought I was purchasing the version of this game that had tiles.,It is okay....I had played ths game before but it had tiles which I liked better. Do you stil have the version of this game with tiles??
1,"If you read ""Into the Blue ""don't buy this tape!","Robert Goddard wrote an outstanding book in ""Into the Blue"". The screenwriter totally twisted the story and plot into an unrecognizable mess! I watched part of this program when it was broadcast by PBS, I was sick. The ending is totally changed! YUK!! END"
5,John Thaw,"John Thaw takes over every movie he is in,he is without a doubt the best actor there ever has been. I have all of his movies and tv shows and I watch them when I think I may have forgotten the plot. If you like John Thaw you will love this movie,if you don't I feel sorry for you."
3,OUT ON A LIMB,"All the elements of an intriguing mystery are cast before your very eyes. A one night stand, an abundance of murders over a thirty year period and unquestioned loyalties grab your attention. Unfortunately you are left hanging out on a limb because too many of these elements are bombarding you and you find yourself confused as to what is going on in the movie.Harry, the main character (and caretaker)finds himself in as the main suspect in a murder. He knows that he is innocent and goes about trying to prove it. Come with him as he stumbles over bodies, is tailed, and is almost killed. These bizarre experiences leave him even more determined to unlock the mystery of a woman's death. I felt the movie was patched together with different elements which made it hard to follow. As murder mysteries would go I would rate this as average."
3,"Great service, less than optimal product design","Wish the design accommodated storing extra bits within the handle like several others I looked at; keeping up with a separate little vial of tiny drill bits is already a pain. Otherwise, sturdy construction and fine tooling just as I expected from X-Acto.Item arrived within 3 business days from TCP Global via seller's free shipping option. 5 stars for service, 3 stars for product."
1,Awful!,"This book is pure tripe. The ""love scenes"" were so laughingly written that I think my eyes are permanently stuck up in the top of my head from rolling them so much. I had a friend read a paragraph from one of the loves scenes and she literally laughed aloud, it was so ridiculous. The plot was painfully slow to develop and was really barely touched on by the author. It could have been a great book, but the author didn't delve nearly enough into the mystery of the Trace's past or into her former fiance's involvement in her dad's sudden passing. I am all for an easy read, even a smutty romance novel, from time to time, but this book doesn't even rate that high. Avoid this book!"
3,Slow to get started,"This is the first book I've read by this author. Perhaps, its just an OK book out of many this author has written. If you are going to try Judith Gould's books, I wouldn't start with this one."
1,Bah.,"A total waste of time. Another book that tries to hold on to the classic, outdated, inneffective techniques of a forgotten age of martial arts."
3,Gets the job done,This is a handy little item! I don't keep a nail file in my purse since I once scratched my eyeglasses badly with one. But I always seem to find myself snagging on something so the little file on this product has come in handy several times...
5,Neat little stocking stuffer!,"I really like keeping the Spiffer Manicure pen in my purse. The pen writes okay. It's not the best writing pen, but the price is right for this item. The nail file is found on the pen top clip. This pen is mainly just for touch-ups. I have brittle nails that constantly chip or break off so it's nice having this little pen handy to use when that happens."
1,Not even close!,Most uncomfortable boot ever. Soles have no cushion deff not made for standing any length of time . inside finish is very hard at seam locations and VERY uncomfortable even when worn as loose as can get. I hope they ( break in ) some and are tolerable otherwise these will go in the trash. JUNK JUNK JUNK
5,Nice Boot!,Pretty grey and look to be very nice quality. Bought them for my friend for Christmas. Less expensive than Timberlands and look just as nice to me. Would have bought them for myself but they didn't have my size.
5,A Book I Will Read Again,"My mother handed me this book--I thought ""Oh no another school book."" When I started I discovered how incredible a 17th century mathematician can be.This book is especially good if you try to work out the mathematical equations it contains.This is a very good book.Though it would not make much sense to people younger than 13.READ THIS BOOK. I am going to read it again."
3,A good book for the right audience,I should have read the other reviews more closely. This book is written for a target audience of 5th and 6th graders. I was expecting a factual biography but this is actually a children's book written to entertain. I believe it probably does entertain to the targeted audience but I would not recommend this book to someone researching this theologian's life.
1,Not very good for juggling,"I teach children how to juggle and thought these would be a good set for kids. They are not.They are poorly weighted (light and uneven) and that makes juggling next to impossible. I would rather fill 9"" balloons with bird seed (use one balloon filled with seed and then use another balloon over that to keep it all together (cut the necks off of each balloon) than use these expensive badly made items. AVOID."
3,"Balls OK, but not as described","I purchased these items from seller: Zowie Fun.The description on this item states: '...this kid's-sized set of three balls comes packaged in a clear tube...'The balls that I got were packaged in a clear plastic bag. Okay, technically the bag is clear and tube-shaped, but I own several full-size sets of juggling balls that are actually in a clear plastic tube with a lid, so that is what I was expecting. The product photo shows a clear plastic tube. I dislike to nit-pick, but the reason that I bought these particular balls was because of the tube. I know my children, and if the balls did not come with a carrying case of some sort, they would soon get lost. At least, with the tube, I could have kept them all together.I doubt I will return these as it is too close too Christmas and I can't find kids' juggling balls anywhere local. However, when I buy something, I expect to get the items as described."
4,Pretty good,"The juggling balls were pretty good, except they were pretty hard and round for juggling balls. Typically you want juggling balls to have a little give so that when you drop them they don't roll all over the place."
4,"Great figure drawing/manga book, case broke","The book is great and has great suggestions. The tools were decent including the french curve that came with it.But the case broke within the first 30 min. of having it. :-(Other than that, great!"
1,Not worth it.,"I had 2 of these and the first one started leaking (staining) blue after 3 months of use, and the other one after 6 months of use. Not fun to have blue all over my hands, lunch bag and food. I think they should last must longer and the dye should not be so harsh."
2,Leaks too much,"They do a good job of keeping things cool, but they tend to get worn and start to leak. I purchased the plastic blocks that rubbermaid makes, and they don't leak, in fact they do a better job of keeping things cool and for a longer time."
2,Get some Other Ice- Melts too quick.,Disappointed in this ice. It melts too quick and you have water at the bottom of your lunch box by 10am. I purchased 3 of these and all 3 do the same thing. Now I need to buy another brand. Do not waste your money on these.
3,Chill out,I got this product to place in my lunch pouch to keep things cold. I am a little disappointed that is does not last very long. I wish it would stay solid a little longer. But it does help keep some things cold for a couple of hours.
2,Leaked after first use,"We bought 4 of these to use for keeping lunches cool for work and school. They are terrible and leaked after the first use. They are still useable if we reseal them in a ziplock baggie, but overall they are definitely not worth the money."
4,Blue Ice,This item is very useful for my lunch cooler & beer cooler. It is nice not to fill a bottle or container every time & put it in the frig. It is so easy just to remove them from your lunch pack & just put in the freezer.My only complaint is the shipping amount to receive the item? I should have looked closer @ the cost of shipping & I never whould have purchased them. Shipping was almost as much as the item itself. blue ice
3,pricey for what it is,"The product is fine, but should be much cheaper in a brick and motar store. The photo of the wrap around sheet looked like more than the actual product."
2,Teeny tiny,"These are excellent ice packs if you have a pet mouse with a backache. It would make a perfect bed for him/her/it. Otherwise, it's just way too small. I've bought a few ice packs in my day, and definitely prefer the soft form factor, but these are about 1/2 or 1/3 the size of a regular ice pack. You might want to buy two or three times as many, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having gel packs in the first place - which is to cover space and conform to the beverage or food product."
1,Started leaking immediately,This item began leaking blue liquid over my son's lunch bag after only one use. Very disappointing and seems to be a bit dangerous.
4,"Yep, sounds like Rush","If you're a fan, this is a good one. If not, you're not going to like it. It's far more typical ""Rush-sounding"" than some of their recent work like Test for Echo or Clockwork Angels--a bit less heavy, a bit more melodic."
2,Not to be Missed,"This collection of footage and interviews is a ""must have"" for any Hogan devotee.The footage includes movies from Darracort's camera, familar to many, previously available film clips from other sources that have been pieced together, and much new footage never before seen. The commentary by McClean, Ballard, Toski, Harmon and others is incisive."
1,Don't buy,"The only positive review about these arrows is from the guy who sells them! Beware! He says they're the best deal in bowhunting, he says that about every item he sells!"
1,Terrible - run far away - buyer beware!!,"I purchased some ""crossbow bolts"" from this guy as a gift for my brother in law because of the excellent price. He sent horrible inferior product, with very poor craftsmanship. To top off the poor quality the guy is very unprofessional about the whole transaction. You get what you pay for, and this is a COMPLETE waste of money. I suggest you take a look at some other etailers before doing business with this guy. This is America, and you can do what you want, but I figured I owed this review to the world... consider yourself warned. Buyer beware!"
1,Crown Of Thorns,"I ordered 2 Crown of Thorns on Dec 4. Amazon said I would receive products Dec 9-14. I received on Dec 24th. One was round as should be but the other is completely flat on on part and no way to be considered a ""crown"". I am very disappointed in this product. I wanted to hang this on my wall next to a cross but I will not be able to do that due to the condition of it. This was my worst purchase ever made from Amazon. This did not come in a giftbox and both crowns were in same box with only a sheet of plastic between them."
1,Didappointing,"Sorry this was a great disappointment... I felt that the picture was deceptive and that the crown its self did not in any way represent the crown our Savior wore. it was flimsy, small and put together in mass production style without any reverence for the meaning behind it. I am grateful amazon let me send it back."
2,Too Complicated,"My family purchased this stroller becuase it was promised to be a state-of-the-art side by side stroller that was carrier compatible. It seemed to be the best alternative to the tandem strollers. We were completely fooled. Once you put the carrier on the one side it basically spills into the other seat! My son was so cramped! The safety belts are complicated and you have to open and close them 75 times or oil them to get them to open/close easily. The carriage basket is way too small to store any sort of diaper bag. Also - buy a cup holder. There is no where to store a beverage for the parent. It is however light and WILL fit through doorways. In saying that, if I had the ability to return this stroller/carrier and get all of my money back I would do so in a heartbeat. Spend your money elsewhere."
2,In theory this would have been perfect...,"This is the only side-by-side double stroller that has the option of attaching an infant car seat while leaving the other seat available for another baby/toddler, and it is very lightweight... This was my dream come true UNTIL I actually tested it in the store!The stroller is incredibly flimsy. It shakes and wobbles (without a baby) and wasn't sturdy. It seemed to me like a piece of plastic junk. I was VERY disappointed in this stroller.I tested the other higher end double strollers- Peg Perego and McClaren. My recommendation/choice? Go with the McClaren Rally Twin or McClaren Twin Traveller... it's slightly cheaper than the Peg Perego and about the same price as the Combi. It was very sturdy, folded compactly and was overall my favorite - my daughter really enjoyed her test drive in it too. The only thing I didn't like about the McClaren was it doesn't come with a snack tray for the kids."
5,"The story of a ""winner"" at heart","I spent four years in Rwanda, at Mudende, less than 1/2 a mile down the road from where Roz Carr lived. My wife and I got to know her quite well. This book brought back a lot of memories. She was as good a hostess as she is a story teller. Her love of the country and its people truly come through in this book. She also paints a vivid picture of life there. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read about winners and survivors."
5,A unique perspective,"As a neutral observer, with many Hutu and Tutsi friends, Roz Carr provides one of the few first-hand, objective (and I stress that term heavily here) accounts of the Rwandan situation. For example, her note of displeasure on the faces of the Hutus as they are forced to perform a submissive dance ritual for the Tutsi rulers in the late 50's foreshadows the coming conflict as well as any much-degreed anthropologist could've.Despite her overcoming massive obstacles to come this far, the book left me quite pessimistic about the region's future."
4,Fascinating look into Rwanda's history,"My interest in Rwanda was spurred by watching the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" and reading ""The Poisonwood Bible"" (which is set in next door Congo). This book follows the life of a young woman that marries an African adventurer and goes there at a fairly young age. She winds up spending practically the rest of her life there, and provides a unique and interesting perspective on Rwanda's history. Watching ""Hotel Rwanda"" gave me only a snapshot - leading me to think that Hutus were crazy blood thirsty savages going after Tutsis. Well, many of them were, but this book gave me a little of the background as to why the Hutus are so crazy and militant. Rwanda certainly has had a turbulent history.The book itself is a fascinating look at life on a flower farm in Rwanda over several decades. Diane Fossey plays quite a role, as her gorilla camp was not far from the main character's house. Good story overall."
3,MFK FIsher focuses on people in this memoir,"The two towns are Aix and Marseilles. But there is precious little about food here. These memoirs focus on the people in Fisher's daily life in Southern France: the waiter at her favorite cafe, her doctor, the proprietress where she boarded, taxi drivers, a couple whose window faced theirs, fish wives, mendicants, students, even strangers whom Fisher repeatedly sees.Fisher is a sculptor and words are her tools. She chips away the banalities and highlights the quirks and mannerisms unique to her subjects. Her characters are not wooden; they were warm and vibrant.Both books would have benefited from stronger editing. Sections could have been cut, leaving a tight, cohesive memoir. I had to push myself through parts, knowing Fisher's characters and turns of phrase would eventually reward me."
5,Love or Business?,"There are thousands of CDs recorded each year. Most of them are made to turn a buck. Although I'm sure Dave would like to at least break even on his recording studio costs, it's obvious he's making this music out of pure love. The bonus for listeners is...he's a great singer / song writer and he makes great music, from the heart. I highly recommend this CD!Richard Ray Classical Public Radio Network"
5,Illuminating: Alchemy in Light,"Alchemy in Light:Making Art Glass, a video documentary, is an intriguing and illuminating view into the creative and technical work of making art glass.It's inspiring to see artists so involved in the fluid and capricious process of making art glass, to see the results, to hear their individual experiences of the creative process and what it means to them.I've seen this video several times and it's just as exciting and inspiring as the first viewing. Anyone who is interested in or works in any art form can enjoy and even benefit from this video."
4,"I love it, except for one flaw","This is a great unit overall. It allows me to seamlessly control my iPod through the deck while I'm driving, and the iPod can remain hidden when I'm not in the car. It sounds great, and works like a charm.BUTThe iPod interface can be very annoying. Unless you make playlists on your iPod, it is a HUGE pain to find a particular song. Rather than have the song/artist/genre etc lists in simple order of 26 letters (a,b,c, etc) they have EVERY song and EVERY artist on the list. so if you have 2,000 songs, you have to scroll through up to 1,999 songs to find it! Who's the idiot who let that slide?Basically, just make playlists, and you'll be set. Other than that flaw, it's a great deck."
3,Scrubbing,"I hope to scrub my 38 feet RV with these scrub pads, but I don't think they are what I thought they were."
5,A Perfect Book For Chanukah,"I read this to the children in my Sabbath school class. It is worded simply enough for a child to truly enjoy and understand it. It is factual and to the point, so adults can appreciate it as well. It is very colorful and well illustrated. I HIGHLY recommend this book for parents, children's Sabbath morning classes, babysitters, etc etc. Its wonderful. Its a wonderful gift to give to children : nieces, nephews, grandchildren. Its such a nice book even people who have no children will appreciate this book. I have no children, and I love this book. (However I read to the children in the neighborhood as well as to the children in my congregation) Such a wonderful book I can't say enough about it."
4,Great Book,"I used this book with 3rd graders, and I felt it was a little difficult for them. However, I took time to explain the historical and Biblical context to them. I felt it did a great job of helping us understand why Hanukkah is celebrated. It also provided some great activities in the back of the book that were helpful and interesting. Overall, this book provided my group of 3rd graders with a rich experience and they really enjoyed it."
3,does its job,"The good news is: this product keeps food from sticking to flimsy pots. The bad news is: I couldn't get the sticker off the bottom of it, so it burned and smelled bad. More annoying: the metal of the simmer plate itself seems to flake and burn, leaving charred bits on the stove."
3,Problem with handle.,This doesn't work well if you're cooking something in a large stock pot. The handle attachment doesn't allow the pot to sit properly centered on the simmer plate.
5,No- burn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The heat diffusers are great. When I make spaghetti sauce I can simmmer it all day and it doesn't burn
2,Poor results with quinoa,"I got this product primarily to cookquinoa, which sticks terribly when I prepare it either alone or inside soups or porridge and requires quite frequent stirring. I wanted to avoid having to stir so much.As is required with this device, after I brought a pot of soup with quinoa in it to a boil on a burner without this device, I then placed it on a burner turned down to on low/simmer with this device on top of it. Unfortunately, I had to remove the pot of soup and put it on a regular burner after 45 minutes, because when sitting on this device, the quinoa inside the soup refused to cook! Normally it only takes 15 minutes for it to cook on a regular burner. It seemed as if it was never going to be anything but hard and uncooked if I left it on this diffuser.This problem, unfortunately, essentially renders the product useless to me for the main purpose for which I purchased it.I don't make pudding very often, so I can't say if it works for that."
4,Great Item,"I use the heat diffuser daily for cooking on small inexpensive non-stick cookware. I works perfectly, no hot spots or boil overs. There is one minorissue with the diffuser. The first few times you must put up with a burning odor. Other than that, no problems.L F"
2,Turns Black on first use...,"The heat diffuser turned black the first time we used it. Even after washing it constantly it stays black. I hoped for better quality of the diffuser. Though it does the primary job OK, but its a sore eye and i don't like using it."
5,Hard to find,"We have been looking for theses style of heat diffuses for our stove as our old ones are just about dead. We tried lots of local stores and other stores that we went to while traveling around Washington state. No where in our travels did we come across anything similar. These are almost the exact same type as the ones they are replacing. We just reached a point where we knew we had to replace them, and yet again I can find exactly what I need at a great price here on Amazon."
2,Not so great with gas stove,"I purchased both this item and a cast iron diffuser to use with various pots (including pressure cooker) on my gas stove. I needed a low, uniform heat to protect my pots and pans from black hotspots and uneven heating.The cast iron diffuser works MUCH better than the cheap metal one, plus looks nice on the stove."
5,Perfect,"Addition to my simmer cooking. I really like it. My simmer control on my burners has never been low enough. I really like to ""simmer"" things"
4,heat diffuser,"i ordered three different heat diffuser and I noticed they all have a very similar quality. I think to order this type of diffuser, it would be reasonable to go with the cheaper one with free shipping if available"
4,The Jewish cookbook standard,"This is the cookbook that started it all and the book by which all other Jewish cookbooks aspire. It is homey and the recipes contained in its pages are sure to please your old-world longings or handed-down memories. Be forewarned that none of the original recipes are low-cal, low-fat anything and if you indulge, you can almost hear your arteries slamming shut. But just one taste of a light, fluffy matzo-ball . . . let me tell you, it's a machiah!"
2,great record! full of energy and unpretentious pop-punk...,"Songs like ""Lemon Drop"" will catch you by suprise with their catchy hooks and punk rock edge...A must have record..."
5,Works just as intended.,"I used this to transport a Synology DS212+ via FedEx and hand carried on an airplane for data delivery. It works great, feels solid and fully protected the device during transport.The foam was easy to pluck and create slots for my device and power adapter."
4,super tough,"tough, good size, i use it for a nikkon d5000 camera and a few accessories. the only problem i have with it is the latches. they take a little effort to close, my wife has difficulties with it. maybe they will get easier over time"
5,Dry camera while rafting,"I purchased this case to protect my DSLR camera and lenses while taking a rafting trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in Idaho. It not only protected my camera from bumps and dings but kept it dry for the entire week long trip. The case held a Canon 40D camera along with fisheye lens, 70-300mm lens, 30-70mm lens and accessories (extra batteries, lens cleaning kit, etc.) Great product!"
4,Pelican case,The pelican case I purchased meets my needs. However the picture does not reflect accuracy of the product. It was advertised with foam but was featured with the padding instead.
2,Language not great,"You would think this is a good toy at first, until you hear the language it uses. Lightning yells ""Get out of my way!!"" over and over, which is not something I want my boys to hear, much less start repeating. Children these days are rude enough without learning it from their toys! Why would the manufacturer include this rude phrase??!!Note: We reserve the right to edit or reject reviews that include inappropriate content, profanity, references to other retailers, pricing, or personal information."
2,Rude Pre-Recorded Voice,"Although my boys love this toy, I have one big problem with it -- the pre-recorded voice yells ""Get outta my way!"" It can be so difficult to raise children with manners in today's society, I do not believe that a TOY should be working against parents. If this one statement would be removed, I believe that this would be a great toy."
4,Little Nephew loves it!,My little nephew got this toy from me for Xmas and he's been playing with it ever since. He absolutely loves it!
5,This is my 14 month old's favorite toy,"My 14 month old daughter LOVES this toy. She loves all the buttons to push (and the sounds and music aren't even that annoying compared to most toys!) and turning the key. Also, the seat opens up and she loves to hide toys in there. It's a great size for her- she can get on and off it by herself. I recommend it- it's the best toy we bought her for Christmas!"
2,Stickers fall off right away & audio is very irritating,My 22 month old really likes this toy but the stickers fell off right away. I'm not sure why the manufacturer couldn't step up for a higher quality sticker given the fact toddlers are using this toy! There is no on/off button for the sound and it's really loud. The audio is really cheesy too.
4,Little man and his car,He loves this car...he makes the sounds all day long. He thinks he is just like daddy with his car.
5,Full of Fun!,"I thought this was cute in the picture and my nephew has one just like it. But nothing could have prepared me for how much my son would love this toy! We gave it to him for his 1st birthday and he plays with it nonstop. He can climb on by himself and push all the buttons. He likes to bounce to the music and imitate the car noises. He touches the moving eyes and mouth and giggles. He walks behind it, pushing it along. I think his favorite thing to do though is open up the top of the seat and stash things inside. Kids his age love to do that...haha! What an ingenious design with so much fun packed into one fabulous toy!"
5,Lot of fun and Educational,"I bought this toy for my 18 months old son.He normally don't play with toys ,but he played with this almost everyday for 2 months .Also he learned his alphabets and numbers with in a month.We are very satisfied with this ."
3,A Real Review,"The previous 2 reviews tout this as one of the best albums in the industrial/EBM genre. The album is fair at best, good if you are just getting into this type of music. Please dont try to compare this to Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly or Front 242, these guys were the pioneers and represent the best there is to offer in Industrial/Synth music."
1,Pathetic attempt of a romance novel,After I finish reading this book I had to fight the urge to throw it straight into the trash because I had just finished reading garbage. What a complete waste of time and effort. The book is so out of place. I was very disappointed by the author because I usually enjoy her books but nothing could get to like this complete mess of a book.
4,"Not Only a Steamy Romance, but History Too","""Desired"" has something for everybody--fans of steamy loves scenes will find them in plentiful supply; fans of medievals will find tournaments, battles, and plenty of political scullduggery; fans of historicals will find some plausible (if not 100% accurate) information on that great English house, the Plantagenets. The love story, of course, takes precedence, and it has all of the misunderstandings, the longing looks, the fights and reconciliations, and the intimate wranglings anyone could ask for. So why don't I rate it a 10? For one, I found myself laughing during some of the sex scenes (I won't go in to details) and for another, I found the heroine a stubborn brat for most of the book. It's all well and good for a heroine to be stunningly beautiful, extremely talented, and kind to animals, but when she is annoyingly dense and rude about a perfectly good hero, I feel nothing but annoyed."
2,Prince charming was less perfect than this hero,I didn't like this book.I agree with previous reviewers who said the hero was too perfect and Brianna was too immature.The hero can do everything he has no weaknesses even superman is susceptible to kryptonite.I didn't like him reading the heroine's mind at all.Brianna was a little too dumb for my taste I don't know what else Roger could have done to make her realize he was evil.The supernatural thing was overdone as other reviewers have pointed out.This is my least favourite V.Henley that I've read so far.I like my heroes to have feet of clay.
5,"HOT, HOT ,HOT","After reading several of Henley's books, I've decided that this one is the most provacative.Great steamy sex scenes as well as a great story."
3,Good Story...Bad Research,"I really enjoyed this book and found story and the characters compelling. Particulary Edward, the Black Prince. So much so that I did some online research about him (and Joan)after finishing the book. I must take the author to task for her ""interpretation"" of history. This book has almost no truth to the history presented. History obviously got in the way of what the author thought was a good story.That being said, this is still a good book and I would recommend it. Just be aware that what you read isn't what actually happened."
1,An introduction to computer crime,"Of all of the computer security books that I've read I would say this is probably the one that's at the bottom of the list. It gives you an introduction to computer hacking, phreaking, etc. The book also talks about some of the people involved in such crimes and what they did.I would recommend this book to someone really young that wants a general overview on the topic. The only reason I read it is because it's the only book that my school library had."
2,I'd like a salami sandwich on wheat please.,"One of the first computer crime books I have read (freshman year in high school). It got me more into computer security than I was to begin with. Reading this book in class is what got me known as a hacker amongst my classmates, as much as I didn't want to be associated with that."
5,Woo Hoo HOOOOOO!!!!,"There's this one where the people are tricked into thinking they are eating dog food. It is hilarious. If you get this and you don't laugh, you are either devoid of humor or my wife.Buy this movie, of 35 ""pranks"" 5 are really really really funny. The one where people at a public pool are made to believe they are showering in blood is so funny you will cry."
2,decent but lots of factual errors,"I haven't read this in a few years but from what I remember it was a decent overview of musical censorship. The problem is that there were too many fairly egregious factual errors. For instance, when he talks about nirvana's In Utero, he refers to it as their ""second studio album"" and references the ""multiplatinum success of their debut album, Nevermind."" I know that doesn't have a lot to do with his argument, but it's not like Bleach is a particularly obscure or hard-to-find album...nailing basic facts about his subjects' histories would do a lot to add to the credibility of the rest of this book. There are better books on this subject."
1,too many errors,"I found this book to have too many unforgivable errors. There are plenty of books on the subject, I would pick a different one."
2,Who tested the prototype and first production units?,"The knife is very nice looking but that is where it ends. Opening and closing this knife is a pain. I could not open the knife with one hand and that is the point of the stud on top of the blade. The liner lock has so little reveal that it has to be activated by a thumbnail. Because the knife was so inexpensive, I will try to modify the knife to improve the operation rather than return it."
2,difficult to follow and unclear explanations,"This book was very difficult to understand. If it hadn't been for the professor's clear interpretation of the material presented in this book, I wouldn't have been able to follow it at all. Mr. Simmon's limited explanation of the mathematics and skipping critical steps in the examples make for very frustrating reading."
5,Great replica and item for collectors,"Everything about the sword is 5-star quality. My only problem is the sheath was filled with white stuff which I believe is polish. It's nice that they polished for a buyer, just wish whenever I take it out of the sheath that the white particles didn't catch onto the blade and I have to take them off. Besides that, great buy, and it's from True Swords. I will buy again and I can already say it will be the Masamune replica."
3,Cheap Sword,This is an okay. Sword. It rattles alot. THe guard is huge compared to the tiny blades. The wave design in it looked alright. I don't think it was worth $55.00. It was a pretty cheap sword.
2,NOT cruelty-free (Amazon categorizes it as such),"This note of alert is intended for those who care: Amazon includes this soap in its category ""cruelty free,"" a choice on the left side of the page that narrows results within ""soap."" That is flat-out incorrect. The ingredients listed on the package include goat's milk, but the main ingredient is tallow--in other words, animal fat. It might or might not be tested on animals (I don't know), but it is definitely MADE of animals. I ordered this based on its good reviews and Amazon's categorization of it as cruelty-free. Since the ingredients are not listed in the product description as of this writing, and because repacking and returning items is a pain in the neck, I am mentioning it for those who might, like me, want to know."
2,wrong product was sent,I have been happy with all purchases I have made except this one. I ordered the regular goats milk soap and got the one made with vegetable oil. I had already opened it so I didn't return it but do not like the product at all. I am scared to order again in fear of getting the wrong product again.
5,I Love this Product!,"This is a great soap with a wonderful fragrance. I have been using it for a couple of years now and everytime that I unwrap a bar, I am reminded how great it is by the wonderful fragrance.It's funny -- before I used this soap, I used whatever was available. Now that I tried it, it's the only soap I use. So, here it is in a three-pack.Also try the lotion and the bubbly bubble bath."
3,Soap Scum,"I have found that it leaves waaaay too much soap scum even after just 3 showers. I hate cleaning the tub so often. You HAVE to clean it before a bath. It's a real pain. I have gone back to using Dove. I've used milk soap before, but a different kind, and loved it. Maybe this brand is fine if you don't take baths."
3,Canus Goat's milk bar soap,"I had ordered this for a friend and she was disappointed that the manufacturing was not in Canada. By all indication on the description is was but when we received it, it was made in Waterbury, Vt. For some reason, she knows there is a difference. It was a gift for her birthday so she will still use it but was disappointed. The soap is a different color but seems to still do the trick!"
5,Canus Goat's Milk Bar Soap,I love this soap. It is gentle on the skin and has such a clean smell. It is all I use in the shower.
4,Enjoyable for every level golfer...young and older.,A must play for every level of golfer...Written instruction could be more comprehensive. Love this golf game.
5,Fast shipping,"It was great to get an out of print book in very good condition for a fair price, and it arrived very fast."
4,Introduction to learning and helping,"Here is the review I wrote for The Home School Manual ===============A Student's Guide to Volunteering A good book about a terrific way to learn by doing. Beyond developing marketable and useful abilities, volunteers have the opportunity to touch people showing that they care. And caring itself is something to be learned. The first part of the book covers some general principles then discusses opportunities in six major areas open to teens. The second part is a listing of resources in the six areas, then volunteer organizations by state (in the U.S.) The chapters include story examples of what volunteering in various jobs is like. One chapter discusses how to set up a youth volunteer organization."
2,Too much of what I expected,"I enjoy a good fun read, it's entertainment after all, and I expected this to be one. It is a good idea, and started off pretty much what I expected. But not to be too harsh, it soon became too much of what I expected. Too much pop culture references, although they were good ones, and too much selfishness on the part of Kat. An honorable man who bends the definition, and a queen that is too innocent and sweet to really hold the position. I know it's fiction and a time travelling one at that, but a little realistic behavior from the characters isn't too much to ask. I think once started I must finish it however I was glad to reach the end."
4,Funny Easy Time Travel Read,"So I got this book from my mom because I volunteered for a few years at a Renaissance Faire and I love humor and Romance Novels. It was right up my alley, its fun, funny and an easy quick read. I would not recommend this to folks who want some kind of true representation of King Arthur but lets face it there is so much legend mixed into those stories that I am not sure anyone can really separate the fact from the ficton. But I will say not to expect to feel you have exactly entered a previous time period, if you expect more of a historical fantasy experience than you may find it more enjoyable. It made me laugh which I really like....don't miss the sequel I think ""A Hoboken Hipster in Sherwood Forest"" is even better."
3,This was okay,The author does a passable job for her first foray in the time travel romance genre. I expect way better from her if she publishes her next one. I like the way she plays with the legend of King Author though.
1,Boring,"I did not like this story at all and did not find it very funny. I could not stand Kat, did not get much insight into Lance or any other character for that matter. I was so bored or annoyed with the plot that I skipped through the last half to the end which some might find cleavor but I found to be another annoying element of the plot that leaves the reader without any resolution so the whole story becomes a big unfunny joke. I expected this to be a humorous time travel love story. My mistake, it was just a ridiculous farse on the Camelot tale."
1,Truly Terrible,"Kat is one totally annoying chick and Lancey was whipped, no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I had looked forward to this book very much, a big waste of paper and ink. I couldn't suffer much more beyond the 1st chapter."
1,another nassar piece of garbage,"if you read these books and follow his fluff then you will be robbed of your money by professionals like me. trading takes advanced and sophisticated methods not capable of being properly expressed in a book targeted to the masses. people spend years educating themselves to be able to pick money from the inexperianced, like those who buy this book. best of luck and you can find good use for the book proping up a table of starting a fire after your done reading it"
4,Good Choice.,"I recently finished the book and think it is a sound choice to add to any trading library. The rules are spelled out and provide a great foundation for building a trading strategy. If you plan to start trading or are trading then this book will provide you lots of insurance against blowing up your account.It is not however a how to book on trading, if that is what you are looking to read, you will need to search elsewhere."
4,GOOD PICK FOR THE POOH FAN,"I bought this book quite a while ago, and we just love it. My daughter is 20 months old, and loves Pooh. This book is educational, and teaches opposites very well. It's short enough to keep her attention, colorful and an easy read. I would recommend it."
2,Not impressive at all,"I expected a lot more from this book given it is not just The Best of...but the The Best of The Best of...In any case, very little of the work shown here is good but overall, it is a very weak group of business cards. If you're a seasoned designer, I am sure you have a stack of collected cards that is of higher caliber than the ones shown in this book. Better spend your quasi $30 on another book."
4,"LNS a ""thumbs up""","""In addition to presenting a number of very hot looking young women, the film is a clever, entertaining send up of academics on Shakespeare."" Richard Burt, PhD, author UNSPEAKABLE SHAXXSPEARES"
3,"Very sexy, very funny, great music, worth it!","Although the video seemed to be billed for its sex content, the satire and humor in this movies was very refreshing. The dancing is hot and the girls are hot but the funny parts in between are what makes me want to watch it again.Very good music too! I heard about this movie on the G. Gordon Liddy radio show."
2,Absured or juvenile?,"Some of the later plays are interesting but I think it was a mistake to include his earlier work.I have heard of `theatre of the absurd' but this is theatre of the juvenileTo be fair, there are some glimpses of something more grown up, such as the referenced to relativism in `Titanic' but that was written when he was slightly older, under the tutelage of an expert dramatist.Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You was a good reminder of how toxic pre-Vatican II Catholicism was but the play was spoilt by the playwright's comments, at the end, on how to cast it. If that play was that good, it would speak for itself.There was something Kafkaesque about The Ac tor's Nightmare' and Beyond Therapy was the one really good play that I would pay to go and watch."
1,This gun works but it only shoots 10 feet,When it arrived I was really excited and was super careful with it. I let the battery charge for 12 hrs. (like it said). When morning came I ran outside and shot it. I was really mad because I couldn't even shoot it to the fence. SO PLEASE TAKE MY ADVISE AND BUY SOMETHING BEDDER.
2,WTF!!!,"Ok so i bought the damn thing. was mad excited. shot it and wanted to shoot myself for ever droping the coin for it. the description says what it somes with... lies. no goggles, how ever i dose come with a speed loader and two 50 round clips. all in all its sounds like a beast and accually shoots like it has downsyndrome. such a wast. the thing is ALL plastic. WARNING! *UNLESS YOUR BUYING THIS AS A JOKE, DONT WASTE THE MONEY* <('-'<)"
1,"gun is ok, but mag STINKS","DO NOT BUY THIS GUN. i promise you that all of the 5 star reviews are not true. the gun, when i got it, sounded cool, but did not fire any bbs. When I looked closer at the gun, i found that this was the mag was not working. On any airsoft mags, there is a button, that when the gun automatically presses it, bbs are discharged into the gun. I pressed this button, without the gun attached, and no bbs came out. I then turned the mag upside down and pressed it, and all of the bbs fell out due to gravity. So, I put the mag on the gun, and shot. No bbs came out. Then, like I expected, I turned the gun upside down and shot. The bbs came spurring out perfectly. Yet I might add, it would look a little weird carrying an AK47 upside down, in airsoft or anything. So, in conclusion, this gun stinks, do not buy it, do not listen to the 5 star people, go buy a better one, and so no, i would not recomend this to anyone and BUYER BEWARE."
4,good gun!!!,"this gun is one of my best airsoft guns. GOOD: it looks really awesome, and is very sturdy. it fires at a high rate. BAD: it does not hold its charge for more than a few hours on full charge. also, it does not always fire on semi. overall, i recomend this gun. it works very well. you should buy this gun."
2,"good gun at first dont't buy this, and don't ignore this comment","this gun is great at first. i loved it until one day the barrel just snapped off. i didn't really care too much. then after two weeks i had it, the auto wouldn't work. then after three weeks the strap clips broke off(the strap it comes with is really good, it also comes with safety goggles and a cleaning rod.) well i took the clips off my old gun, no big deal. but then one day about a month after i got my gun, i was playing then my gun just stopped working. i recharged the battery and put it back in (i charged it normally before it broke and tried the batteries of my old guns to make sure it was the gun, not the battery). my gun wouldnt work again. i was so mad! i might have had a defective gun, now looking at everyone's reviews. but i honestly loved this gun before it turned to crap."
4,this gun,"I do admit this isnt the highest quality aeg on the market, but I still like it. I needed somthing for playing with friends and backyard skirmishes, and quite frankly, I think it does it's job quite well."
1,two thumbs down from an owner,"THIS GUN IS THE WORST. I just got this gun today and I was so excited. After viewing the quality (lowsy) I put on the sling that came with it. Only seconds later the ring snapped clean of the gun, not a huge deal. After loading the clip I noticed that I could open the clip up by gently pulling on the sides, nothing a little duct tape couldm't fix. After charging the battery I took it out to the back to test fire. First on semi. I aimed at my shed no more than 50ft away. The bb missed completely and swerved about 10 ft left. Then full auto. EVEN WORSE!!! This time the bbs didn't even reach the shed.To wrap this review up DON'T BUY. Save up for a UTG Warhwk if you are still looking for an Ak. Otherwise buy a spring gun like the Super 9 ProPeace Out"
1,sucks @$$,this gun is horrible no way it shoots that hardit is exremely inaccurateand the inside parts are cheap and break easyremember its not the looks of the gun that counts its the parts inside itgood things:look goodgood for close rangebad things:cheap plastichi cap clip (they take forever to wind up so i buy the regular ones)scratches itself when shootsstock breaks easyif you want a good cheap gun type in M83 on searchi aint a kid im 15 but i didnt want to do the form
3,"Good Gun, Doesn't last","First, wheni ordered this gun, it said it would come in about 3-5 days or something with standard shipping but it took like 2 weeks to get here. I had good accuracy and distance and was really good on auto because unlike some other guns that aren't accurate on auto, this one is. All my friends were thinking of buying one untill about 1-2 months after i had it, the trigger broke off. It doesn't last and the battery runs out really quick. Also, the barrel isn't very sturdy, if you put any weight on it, it will snap off. If you buy this gun, be very carful with it and i reccomend buying the 400 round clip because the standard runs aout really quicky if you go on auto."
3,looks good,"It looks and souns like (not as loud) a real AK. From five feet away without the orange tip you can't tell the diffence.Don't use .12g BBs with this gun, they go all over the place.It shoots fast but not hard, good for people who want to battle but don't like getting hurt too bad. The range is pretty good thanks to the adustable hop-up system, but don't expect to hit anyting reliably beyond 30 feet. The one draw back to this gun is the construction. The plastic is cheap and poorly put together so don't be too rough with it."
4,Alright,"I bought this gun last week and I was expecting a very powerful gun and this was not it. It shoots around 200 fps which is not very fast if you play airsoft a lot. One good thing is the firing rate. It fires very fast so you can unload a lot of bullets, which you have to since it fires a little bit slow. I would recommend this gun if you don't play long range, since it has trouble going very far. It seems quite sturdy, and it works well."
1,crap,This is not the picture that i used in deciding to purchase this gun i am very disappointed the stock was supposed to be foldable
1,Broke within a month,The gun was very cheaply made. My son only got to use it for a few weeks before it broke.
1,Cheap for a reason,"Cheap gun, never worked right, difficult to get customer service, really not worth the minimal expense, especially since shipping is nearly the cost of the gun!"
1,AK,Let me just put it this way: the only useful things I got out of buying this were the parts inside the gun. I played ONE round with this gun and the trigger snapped off.
1,"WASTE OF MONEY, PIECE OF JUNK","This gun broke less than a minute after taking it out of the box. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. The rings that you hook the sling onto pulled free immediately (they were so cheaply made they resembled the metal that staples are made from), the gun dropped ONTO A CARPETED SURFACE and the barrel broke off. Then it cost me ten bucks to send the gun back to the seller. It's been weeks and still no refund."
4,this gun,This gun has a great look and feel but it is not acurate and has too much hop up. It doesn't shoot as fast as it says and it is very fragile so you have to be careful with it.
2,DUDE!!! not worth it,"Ok, do not, I repeat DO NOT BUY the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it looks cool. When you first get it( If you are a noob) You will think it is totally awesome, because it's full auto and everything. The thing has a plastic gear box mine only shot about 5 BB's per second at like 140 fps!! then I let my friend use it and he was so afraid of getting shot that when he jumped out to shoot he got so scared he tripped and broke the trigger off!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!! NO EXCUSES!!!!!!!!!"
1,DONT BUY THIS GUN,"this gun is horibble. i was so exited when it came i opened it up and it was not even the rite gun. the next day i started shooting and playing with it and the magazine broke so i fixed it and carried on. so the next day i start to play again and the trigger brakes and it is not fixable i took it all apart to see if i could fix it and every thing fell out. it says that this guns fps is 220 try 120fps.it is the worst, dont buy it save up for a tokyo marui or something like that. i only rated it a 1 because you cant rate it a 0."
3,shoots fine but......,the ak shoots fine but the magazine that came with it instead of it being the hicapacity mag it was the standard 50 round mag. they did not give me what i paid EXTRA for.
1,Way too big,in the picture its smaller than my hand but when i got it it was huge! i thought i could give it to my son but it was too big for him.
4,A Great Gun For The Price,I recently owned a $50.00 M16 from Dicks Sporting Goods that lasted me for about a year until I set it down on the ground and my sister accidently steped on it and it cracked in half. So I went on amazon and I found this one. The discription said that it would arive in 3-5 days but it too 10 days to get here. I unboxed it and it looked pretty cool. It came with a strap and bb's etc. So I took it out and plugged in the battery which takes 7-8 hours to fully charge. I wanted to put the strap on but I realized that the back hoo to attach the strap onto wasn't there. Over all it is a cool gun.
4,ok gun,this gun was a pretty good gun it has some good fps but even once mine is pretty broken it still works and still hurts alot and then i tried to buy an hfc ak-74 and it said 3-7 days and it has been a month do not BUY HFC!!!!!!!!!!
4,wish i knew about the newer model,"ok this is a cm.022 by cymait is rated at 200fps but like most guns, it is over ratedit fires about 150 to 170nice weightthe color isnt so great but it is the best gun in its price classuntil your see the newer model which is the cm.028 which first is rated at 330fps and fires about 250 and 700-1000rpmi suggest u get because it is only 10 more dollars and made by teh same company and if u search online it beats the utg warhawk in quality but not power"
1,horrible gun,horrible. broke in the first seconds that i got it. i thought it was a good quality gun from crossman but it is a cheap horrible gun from china. incredibly hard to get it to work.
4,My Review,"Alright well the t=gun that came to my front door was a .022 Ak 47 with a red top which is really annoying and it is all plastic, really inaccurate if its in full auto but good price for a gun if you wanna just practice or have fun with friends"
3,Regretful,ok i got this gun in the mail today.... i was extremely excited. when i opened it it looked great. almost identical to the real AK47. The only reason i bought this gun was because i wanted an AK and i had a gift card to amazon. i regret spending every penny. the only reason i like it is because the looks and how it is another rifle in my arsenal. the problems are that it is so light but in a bad weight i could through it like 100 ft. it feels like junk. the firing rate is so so so slow and the magazine barely works. the sling is retarded and the adapters break in seconds. honestly i wish i could get my money back. DO NOT GET THIS GUN
3,Beginner's gun at best,"I bought this gun and it came about 4 days later, which is very nice. I took it out of the box and charged up the battery, which by the way you must do before you test the gun out, and then I had some target practice. It has about 150fps 200 at best which is very slow for most airsofters. When the bb reaches about 30-35 feet it falls and curves. The hop up barly helps with that. Also the gun is not very durable at all. I was in a battle and I dropped it in the grass. I picked it up and the stock was hanging by a hair so i just ripped it off and threw away the gun. It does, though, have good accuracy at close range. At about 30 feet I could pretty much hit anything i wanted to. So if you are a beginner and just want to play fun little close range wars with no pain at all, then this is an OK buy. Otherwise dont waste your money."
4,Good for what it is,I did not use this as an airsoft. It is displayed on my wall as more of a replica. I cannot comment on the actual firing of the BBs or the build quality or ruggedness. For what it does for me its perfect. Can't give it a 5 star because its not actually being used as an airsoft gun.
2,sucks!,"this gun is awful the accuracy is terrible the bbs will curve after literraly 10 yardsit looks cool and sounds really good.... but that is the only reason i would ever use this in a war, for intimidation. seriously this is the worst thing ever if you shot a person in the face from 15 fett they wouldnt even noticethis thing blows but its held together well so it probably wont break but yea dont use this unless your messing around or you will get destroyed in battle"
1,|] 0 |\| ' 7 |3 |_| Y,i opened the gun charged it worked ok (the gun came al wobbly) then next day battery somehow snapped
1,Im sorry but,"You all who complain about the ""clip"" are complete morons.Anyone with half a brain knows AK-47s dont have clips they have magazines.A clip is something that is held inside the gun. It usually holds 5-10 rounds. Like the M1 GarandA Magazine is something that holds bullets outside of the gun itself, and can be removed/inserted to be reloaded even with bullets left (i believe that cant be done with clips)"
1,THIS GUN SUCKS!,"GUN GETS CLOG EASILY AND IT STOPED WORKING AFTER I TOOK UNCLOGGED IT. I COULDDN'T RETURN IT ANYMORE, BECAUSE I PAINTED THE ORANGE TIP BLACK. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS GUN THOUGH. ALSO, IT DOESN'T SHOOT THAT FAR. ONLY ABOUT TEN FEET. IT'S WAY OFF TOO WHEN IT SHOOTS EVEN IF YOU ADJUST THE HOP UP THINGY."
3,ak-47,this gun is not the best because of the construction but in close combat it shoots where you point it and i made the mistake of charging the battery to long so the battery runs out fast so get a smart charger.
1,no better than a short range uzi,"When I bought this I expected it to have a decent fps, well I was wrong. The hop-up is a failure, The bbs will always just spin out of control. Do yourself a favor and don't buy an electric gun this cheap!"
2,dont waste [...] on this piece of crap!!!!,"ok, i was sooo hype to get this gun. which i waited like a week for. the first day i got it it was awesome, left dents in cans, left welts in people. but the first thing that happened was that the cocking handle broke off. the second day i brought it to a friends house. we tried to shoot it auto but it didnt work for some reason. so we shot it semi-auto then that stopped working all the sudden too. so it broke the second day i got it. sooo don use it too much or shoo semi too quick cuz itll just brake. and i forgot.. i charged the batery full so it wasnt that either..."
4,A MUST FOR ANY SUPREME FAN!,"MOST OF THE MATERIAL HERE IS FROM HER 1991 SECOND SOLO CD EFFORT INCLUDING ""TURN AROUND"", AN UPBEAT R&B NUMBER AND ""U"" WHERE MARY TRIES HER HAND AT A HIPPER SOUND. HER COVERS OF HER SUPREMES' MATERIAL,""YOU KEEP ME HANGIN'ON"" WAS A RESPECTIBLE REMAKE, BUT HER LIVE ""SOMEDAY WE'LL BE TOGETHER"" WAS JUST OKAY. MARY WILSON IS A GOOD SINGER DESPITE ALL THE NAY-SAYERS & DIE-HARD DIANA ROSS FANS. SONG SELECTION IS A KEY FACTOR AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES HERE,DANCE, BALLARDS AND BROADWAY. THE DIANE WARREN PENNED ""UNDER ANY MOON"" SOUNDS LIKE A SEQUEL TO MARY'S OWN ""A WARM SUMMER'S NIGHT"" FROM HER 1979 MOTOWN SOLO DEBUT ALBUM. A JAZZ/STANDARDS ALBUM WOULD BETTER SUIT AND SHOWCASE HER VOCAL ABILITIES, THIS ALBUM IS FOR A FAN WHO WANTS TO HEAR WHAT MARY SOUNDS LIKE."
3,Easy reading. Probably not overly accurate.,"This book is a fun and quick read. As it was written by Cody's adoring little sister, it goes a bit overboard praising his bravery, loyalty, ingenuity, and other attributes. A 19th century work, it is not totally ""politically correct."" Yet sometimes, Mrs. Wetmore is touchingly sympathetic to Native Americans and Blacks. After this book, I am curious to read a more critical evaluation of Cody's life. He must have been a very brave and intelligent man, but I'd like to know how young he really was when he rode for the pony express, if he actually spied on General Forrest and just how impertinently he spoke to the Prince of Wales."
1,Run and Do not look back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"They shoud take this of the market and say out of print. Bad acting, Bad acting, Bad acting. I should have paid attention to the warning once again....Just Run"
2,Skimpy,"Fortunately, I didn't buy this book. I flipped through it in the library. While I didn't spend a lot of time going through it (not much to go through anyway), I can tell you that, in terms of content, this is a lightweight guide.The information on Vancouver, in particular, is embarrassingly brief. Considering what the city has to offer, this guide will cheat you of a more fulfilling visit. There are less than half a dozen options each in terms of activities, restaurants, shopping, and sights.Considering the options available to you, especially good free resources online, I would give this guide a miss."
4,My Netherland Dwarf said 'bleh',"This product looks fine - lots of goodies in it, but, my Netherland Dwarf was unimpressed. Mind you, he's finicky - he's yet to eat any fruit ~ so, given what it looks like and what it contains, if your bun is not so picky, I'd say give it a try. Had mine liked it, I'd have happily bought more for him."
3,Nice but Overpriced,These are VERY nice looking but not worth this price when I got them they were way cheaper like $6 for the set which I must admit was a GREAT sale price for the set of 4.This price is way too much!But with these I doubt you can find something similar elsewhere these salad plates are pretty unique looking.Because of the price I give it 3 stars.If there was a half star I'd give it 3.5.
5,Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Gorgeous.,"I think these are some of the most beautiful plates I've ever seen. They are simple but not boring, rustic yet elegant. The set of four comes extremely well packaged, each plate being individually boxed within a larger box. If I were to send these as a gift, I have no doubt that they would arrive unbroken, and the recipient would be ecstatic. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
5,ON A COME UP!,"I have seen MC OVERLORD on many occassions live, and for the first time I feel he has released a CD that captures the feel and perspective of the live show. This is notorious work for an artist that is certain to to take the world by surprise when he is finally discovered. House of Funk is a tremendous effort. This kid is comin' up!"
5,Bud & Lou never better,"I love both season's 1&2.....You will too..introduce a whole new generation to the ""The Boys"""
2,What an annoying laugh track!!!!!!!!,Two of the greatest funny men in history with some of the most memorable comedy skits ruined by the laugh track!!!
2,Cumbersome drop down calendar for entering dates.,"I really wish there was a different method for selecting the value for the various data fields, such as date of manufacturer or purchase date. Overall the software looked decent.I wanted to be able to just enter an exact date, but could not do that.Instead the software forces you to use a calendar pop up and scroll through it, month by month, until you get to the particular year, month you want and then select a date.I have C&R; firearms that are older than 50 years old, I wasn't about to sit here and scroll back through the calendar a minimum of 600 months to go back 50+ years for the particular date I needed to use.After I discovered that this was the method of entering dates while trying to add my first item into the collection list, I deinstalled the software out of frustration and I'm now looking for something better."
3,It's ok for basic use.,I own about 20 firearms and I wanted something to use to keeps things in order so I bought this NM Gun Collector software. I'm not real happy with it but I'm not disgusted with it either. I think it has some bugs in the software but I'M not an expert. It's ok for what I want out of it.
4,Not such Kamineys after all,"I tried watching it as ""pay-per-view"" in 2009. Could not endure it and switched the TV off without wtching the whole movie. Watched it again yesterday - this time a DVD and I actually liked the movie. Moral of the story - replay a work of art in the format in which the creator intends you to."
2,Disappointing,"This movie did surprisingly very well and Shahid Kapoor earned well deserved praise. I guess he is close to becoming the next Bollywood hero. He is not bad for another muscle-puffed Bollywood actor. These actors need to decide if they are going to spend time building muscles or getting to the business of acting and doing it well. In this particular case, Shahid Kapoor comes through and does a good job of playing the dual roles of twins - one bad, the other good. It's the story that does not connect the dots for me in a way that makes it understandable or coherent as to how the brothers' personalities are different and why one of them chooses a life of crime. It's not fluid. The dark theme of the film supports the premise of the story I suppose. But again the story and its narration has no substance. It's too bad because this film could have been a lot better. I like Shahid Kapoor by the way and look forward to his next film with Rani Mukherji."
2,Not worth the money...,"Two stars for effort. However, for anyone who has been in the 'Nam (3 years, in my case), this book promises a good deal, but does not deliver. Although Kelley put a lot of time into compiling some basic facts, overall it is certainly not worth the money.The ""lists"" of combat bases, combat areas, villes, etc. are less than a thumbnail in length and the maps are of poor quality and difficult to read. It is nicely packaged, but beyond the cover there is just not much there. Maybe Kelley took on too much, going from 1945 to '75.If you want to actually LEARN something about Viet Nam and why we ended up there, I recommend Stanley Karnow's ""VIETNAM, A HISTORY"".Bottom line on ""Where We Were..."", save you money!"
1,Not what was expected,"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my son who is a real Vietnam war buff. He knows every battle, every base, etc. BUT, this book would be too technical for even him. This is a 'dictionary' of the war, strictly a technical manual. It is wonderful for what it is since it contains a plethora of information. If what your looking for though is a readable book of information this is a bad choice. I think it is sorely misrepresented."
2,Digital Quality,"I was very excited when I first saw this title, it's content and it's high rating and I downloaded it immediately. Then I opened it - and what a disappointment! it may be a great book in hard copy form, but it is next to useless for reading on an iPad, because none of the maps or charts are of sufficient resolution to be readable, once they are expanded to a usable type size. This book is loaded with maps, charts and diagrams; these are where the value of the book is found. I may order the book itself - and probably will - but if you are thinking of buying it wirelessly, make sure that you download a sample first to avoid disappointment."
3,Where we were,"This review only covers the download Kindle version, not the actual paper book. I'm sure that the paper version is the more useful for people doing research or old veterans wanting to trace their battles and fire fights. The Kindle version will not fill the bill for these purposes, the maps are not clear enough to read grid coordinances and the more you enlarge them the less clear they become. I have not seen the printed on paper version which hopefully would be clearer. That said, the other information in the book is helpful and useful.Sam Dauer, survivor of the 1968 TET"
5,Where we were in Vietnam,"Very accurate accounting of every unit, where they were, battles fought. I also love the Grid coordinates's. They are very helpful for filing claims with the VA.The VA wants details and this book helps provide that sort of detailed information."
3,maps,"This was a pretty comprehensive book, but as the author stated some would spot omissions or minor mistakes, which I did. My only real beef was that the maps were impossible to read, especially with old eyes. The maps could have been better if they were only one to a page. Overall the $26.00 I spent was worth it, considering what the author went through to get the info."
2,Where we were in Nam,It wasn't what i was expecting. I thought it would be written as a novel and not as a list of docs.
1,Where we were in Vietnam,"Basically this is a military reference in military map reading. I was very disappointed in the electronic version of this book. I was hoping to be able to use the book to help me locate the ""XT"" coordinates of where my brother was killed in Vietnam. This book was not very helpful in this task. I knew the general area before I purchased the book. It would also have been nice to have additional information about the conditions our soldiers had to live in while in Vietnam. If you are going to buy this book, I recommend the paper addition of the book rather than the e-book. But even still it is basically a map of Vietnam, which you could do almost as well on Google. I felt ripped off!"
3,sea,Good info on Vietnam iself but not much on all of southeast asia and air force base's and sqd's.
2,Very Disappointing - Returned,"I was very disappointed in this book, it was written in atlas form and the maps were of poor quality. I would be concerned about the accuracy the first and only item I looked at, Hill 488, was not accurate. With that said, the author did put a lot of work into the book."
5,Get this while it is still in print,"In addition to tons of raw data, there are suggestions for further research, unit web sites, a glossary, as well as information on acquiring maps and (if you're flush with cash) some unit rosters and unit reports).Like any reference work, no reader will need most of it, but the parts that matter to you or me are worth the price (we still like dictionaries and phonebooks, ignoring most of the entries). As Michael Kelley himself writes, readers will surely find many errors and omissions; veterans checking out their own unit and AO can help make the next edition even more useful. The book is rich with unexpectedly interesting material."
5,The Best Vietnam Veteran's In-Country Name/Place Guide,"As one of the webmasters of the Vietnam Veteran's Home Page... I get a lot of questions about names of places, place locations and relationships, map coordinates and other details that a researcher needs or a memory has forgotten. Mike Kelley's book is a godsend for finding and verifying most all of those details. It will undoubtedly take its place in history as the definitive guide to where US and allied troops really were and when they were there. Bonus features like the extensive glossary, maps, name lists, and copious references make this book indispensable."
5,Where Were We in Vietnam,"I have this book in both Kindle and print, and, if you use it a lot, I would recommend both. It's true that the maps are impossible to read in the Kindle version, so, if that's important to you, get the print version as well. You won't regret it."
3,Good Info,"But I thought this was more of a reference book but it is hard to use that way, especially with a Kindle."
3,where we were VN,just began reading. so far nothing special but not ready to put it down. hope it gets better as i cont.
5,book,"This performed as advertised and as expected, it arrived in great sahpe and on time. It has been used multiple times.I would recommend it to a friend"
5,A 'safe' return trip,"An excellent work.. Puts things in perspective. Having been thru areas [after we left] and not knowing where until we were done, it helps to see it thru the eyes of some who cares. I could not imagine what it was like for those in the field before, not knowing for sure their true location. Even today, lending an ear, the pain of confusion and deceit is evident. The references in this book, the events, are very helpful in easing the confusion and at times the pain. Thank You"
2,Disappointment,"If you are interested in map reading, grids, etc., then go ahead. Was not informative to a non military person, and I'm retired Army. Maybe I was looking for more information about where my units were in more detail."
2,Don't bother,"This book was at times comical, but very unrealistic and I would not recommend it for those interested in the Old West."
4,Uniquely Useful,This bag is wide but thin. I am a woman of 5-8 with reasonably athletic build so I can handle it. The straps are in fact very comfortable and I find the waterproof aspect stylish and very reassuring for rainy weather. I use this for school use right now but I am also contemplating taking it on a 4 day trip (using it as a carry-on and my sole luggage). I am wondering if the skinniness of the bag will accommodate my luggage needs and fit clothes well. The front compartment is useful for pens and small necessities. The water bottle holder is on the skinny side. Overall it is incredibly functional. I don't find myself using the laptop side zipper thing much. OH and a HUGE plus...sadly I accidentally left a pack of thawed rasberries in this bag. They leaked all over but after cleanup there were no stains or evidence of the disaster. Still looks brand new. Very Cool
4,A Chemical Skyline,The film has a compelling story. It has some plot holes and does not contain much background information but then again how much can you put into a 30 minute movie? I thought the cinematography was fantastic. The camera was fluid and had great scene transitions. Digital effects were pretty good. Editing was done very well also. A few of the actors didn't sell me the story completely but overall I was impressed and entertained.
2,not a visual timeline,"I warning to potential buyers of this book... I was looking for a visual ""chart a glance"" of what was happening simultaneously throughout history in different geographical locations... listing the events of the years in politics, literature, theater, religion, philosophy, learning, music, science, technology, etc.Unfortunately, this isn't the book. Instead, try: ""The Timetables of History : A Horizontal Linkage of People and Events"""
4,The Women's Bible Commentary,Am delighted with this book - twill be a valuable resource in my growing Feminist Theology section of my library. Am so glad that experts have put this together.
1,Not convinced this is an OEM Fuji battery,"I purchased this battery as an OEM replacement after several bad experiences w cheap knock-offs. Well, this battery isn't much better. Yes it has all the markings of a Fuji battery but all I know is that it hasn't done better than the $5 cheapies I used to buy. Can I prove it's not a Fuji? Of course not. But the battery that came w the camera did really well for 3 years before getting ""tired"". This one did good for maybe two weeks. Now a charge barely holds and the flash recycle times are in the good 1 minute range. Time for a new camera I guess! ))"
3,"Moderately entertaining, but full of mistakes","Whilst I wouldn't go quite as far as the reviewer from Minnesota - I did actually finish the book - I do agree with him about the terrible quality of the writing and editing.I've never read a book where there were so many grammatical and typographical errors. Even simple factual mistakes - since when is 0600 GMT equivalent to 11 AM Eastern Time? Talk about sloppy!Having said all that, I did find the premise of the book very interesting and there were some exciting moments. But it was a shame that, as the book progressed towards the end, it was badly let down by implausible plot holes and inconsistencies.Average first novel, Mr. Mariotti, but please get an editor before you release your next book!"
1,"Dismal, Clumsy, Unedited, Self-Published -- save your $$$","I trully had high hopes for this book, having seen the reviews, and the back cover. I thought it a bit odd that it wasn't in any local libraries. Now I understand why. This book is the second worst book I've ever attempted to read. One that genuinly disappointed me. I wanted and expected it to be good.This book was published at a self-publishing house. With all the punctuation errors, it was obviously not edited for copy--let alone content.In this book, Dialogue is so unnatural as to be very distracting. While the plot may have potential (I don't know, I had to put it down to repackage it for a return), the prose was so clumsy that I couldn't get past page 50. Multiple points of view in one scene (1st person mixed with 3rd person omniscient). Good grief...Mr. Mariotti, stick with your business-related articles and non-fiction book...until you learn the craft of writing fiction."
2,Good if you have little feet,Socks were thick which I admit! I have size 13 foot. Barely had the sock go up past my ankle. Gave away to friend who has size 9 foot. Disappointed! Stay away if shoe size is 11-14.
1,nice colors,Nice colors and if you have very skinny legs these socks will be the thing. I mean no one who has a leg wider then a broom handle will be wearing these socks. I threw mine out.
2,Don't look like the picture,"The socks fit the description, but they don't look like the picture. I went by the picture instead of the description. I was expecting high quality purple dress socks, but these were florescent purple, really thick, knee-high athletic socks. Oh well."
4,Purple,"Just the color I was looking for. I didn't read the discription well enough when I ordered them, as I was expecting dress socks, but I wore then nonetheless and am quite pleased."
2,Thigh Highs,These went waaaaaaaaay up my father's leg. The whole leg. What a laugh. Please revise your description. Buy shorter socks.
4,Monitor para mi DVD,"yo compre este monitor para incorporarlo a mi vehiculo con DVD pioner 3150 y me funciono exelente la resolucion es buena y ahora puedo compartir las peliculas a los pasajeros de atras, ademas el tamaño es fabuloso, los que quieran comprar esto es solo monitor no trae DVD player"
4,numerous very short excerpts...,"from Jewish literature of the late Second Temple era (roughly 200 BCE-70 CE) - a lot of midrash-like folktales, a few psalms that did not make it into the Hebrew Bible, a little wisdom literature, and a few bits of history. This book is a very easy read, and thus is not just for scholars.Some of the books quoted by de Lange could have been in the Bible- but by and large, much of the quoted work is not that enthralling, and after reading this book I understand why the Hebrew Sages excluded most of these books. For example, the book of Judith is about a heroine who stops the army of Nebuchadnezzar and thus saves Israel from the Assyrians- but as anyone familiar with the Book of Kings knows, Nebuchadnezzar (a) was Babylonian and (b) won his war against the Jews. (Though I do wonder why the Sages excluded the Book of Maccabees, which seems to have been pretty well written, explains the genesis of a Jewish holiday, and shows no obvious signs of falsity)."
5,Soups for Every Cook and Every Season,"Soup of the Day is a fabulous cookbook. Its delicious, numerous recipes offer an appealing variety. Its clear directions are easy to follow and most soups may be prepared with minimum preparation.I've already used it as a gift to eight friends, both men and women with varying degrees of culinary skill -- all are delighted. Most enjoy selecting recipes for ""recreational"" cooking on the weekend.People who enjoy background stories will appreciate Lydie Marshall's delightful commentary."
3,Not really C,"The code examples are in C, but the author tries to write it ""Fortran style"". Basically it seems almost as if the code was converted from Fortran code to C by f2c (a GNU translation program). It really seems as if the author's background is in Fortran and hasn't really grasped the fundamental C approach to writing code. However, if you can manage to decipher the code, the technical information is very useful. Most molecular dynamics books still seem to be directed at the Fortran audience, so this is probably as close as you will come to a book for the C audience."
2,Not very usuable,"The code seems to me unclear ,unelegant and slow. Code of the book on the web is unnecessarily complex and hard to understand.This is a book of simplistic recipes without formal explanation. So is not usable to learn or understand. Obviously because it was not written in C originally and translation to C was made in a rush.If you are learning buy Statistical Mechanics by Rowley , Understanding Molecular Simulation by Frenkel or Computer Simulation of liquids by Allen."
2,disappointed for two reasons,"The picture of this leather rug is very misleading...you would never know by looking at it on-line that the back of the rug is entirely black, which shows through when placed on the floor, and black all along the sides, as well. Second disappointment came when I called the company directly to exchange or return it; they wouldn't pay my return shipping since I ordered it through amazon and not directly through them."
4,i was pleased,"I had paid a whole lot more for a leather case that was garage. This was a great product at a great price. I can understand how there might be problems with the plastic flip screen. However, for me I like the added protection since I have a tendency to accidentally call people from my pocket."
1,Good way to throw away money,"This is a product not worth spending your money. It looks nice when it comes but it is guaranteed to cost you more than you spend on it. The cost to replace a phone is very expensive and this will definitely damage your phone. The phone case doesn't hold the phone well once you put it on the clip and hook it to your belt. All it does is hit the floor and your phone goes into three pieces: phone, battery, and back. I didn't let it hit the floor no more after the first four times so now the case is on the floor of my vehicle. Still laying there in two pieces: the front and the back. It is nice if you want to wear it for a day of if you want your phone to have a little bit of wear and tear."
2,WARNING: BAD CLIPS!!!,"Because it was such a good price, I actually bought 3 of these plus the same company's leather case. Within a very short time, three of my four clips broke. I've been ridiculously careful with the fourth and final clip. The clips seem to be made of a very brittle plastic; considerably more fragile than other clips I've owned.I'm trying to make my way through their warranty procedures. We'll see how well that works out."
5,Jason,"This is the way sports should be! Two men, who gave it their allfor their team. It was more for the sport and not the money!Great book!"
4,The Magic Of Baseball,"The Sporting News is untouchable when it comes to baseball. 61* chronicles the Maris/Mantle season like no other. The combination of superb photographs and exceptional editorial makes this book a must have for anyone who appreciates baseball and its history. Whether you are a Yankees fan or not this book brings to life a spectacular season. The power and emotion that captured America jumps off the pages through old time photographs, cartoons, and newspaper clippings from the archives of The Sporting News. I was not alive in 1961 however through the eyes of The Sporting News I feel like I was there. I highly recommend this extroadinary book."
1,book in TERRIBLE condition,"I was VERY disappointed with the quality of this book. The actual story was wonderful, but the condition of the book was horrible. The seller stated it was in very good condition and it was in terrible condition. The pages were crumpled the binding cracked and overall the book looked very weathered. I will NEVER order from them again! The seller's name is: New_Chapter_Recycling_IncIt was very fraudulent of this company to advertise that the book was in VERY GOOD condition, when in actuality it was in POOR condition."
3,Mostly elevator music,"I was given this cd as a gift for Christmas (I live in England and my family live in The States).I really enjoy celtic music when it's done well. Unfortunately the majority of the tracks on this album are not. Most of the songs are the type you'd hear walking through the church offices or in a lift (elevator).If that's what you're looking for great!I, personally, prefer celtic music to have either the aching longing of such songs as Erin Gra Mo Chroi by Cherish the Ladies or the exuberance of most of Gaelic Storm's pieces.There are two tracks on this cd however that I think are good:1- O Come and Join the Dance and 5 - Sound the TrumpetBoth good celtic flavoured pieces that you could dance to."
2,non-dependable batteries,"I was so excited to actually find rechargeable D-size batteries. However, I ordered 4 of these and only 2 of them worked. I contacted the seller, but received no reply. In their defense, I did wait quite some time before contacting them, but still, I should have heard something!"
2,john hopkins medicine ref book,"When I purchased this book thru tou people, I was under the impression that this book was newer than the one I have. It was'nt.It was dated three years prior. Was very disappointed."
4,Shower Power,"This product actually makes conserving water enjoyable. Even though it is a low-flow shower head, because of its self-pressurizing features, it feels almost like a ""normal"" shower -- far superior to other low-flow shower heads I have tried. My only complaint is that if the shower head is angled downward too much (like I need to do for my kids) then the flow of water is severely restricted."
4,awesome slasher flick! (SPOILERS!),"great gory slasher, better than the 1st, it has SAW elements check it out you'll see what i mean. the plot was ok, a little confusing about chromeskulls orginization/cult(BIG PLOTHOLE) who knows. the casting was fine they brought back the guy from the 1st one but a different woman was cast in this one(the other survivor that killed chromeskull). they kill her off at the beginning. Danielle Harris and Brian Austin Green work for chromeskull, no explanation why. But other than that its a great slasher i have seen in a while(also check out SCRE4m), check it out. Also watch after the credits there's more."
3,I'M TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION HERE!,"I will say I never saw the first movie. I was confused as this movie assumes that you did see the first installment. I was asking basic questions such as ""Who is Chromeskull? Why is Chromeskull? Why does he kill? What is this organization behind him?"" I felt behind and found myself going back through scenes to see if there was something I missed.Once I got over that, I have to ask...Seriously. If you are going to kidnap someone, wouldn't you think about checking them for a cell phone before you lock them up?The cops have various clues and leads and are hunting down Chromeskull as he, or I should say his slightly inept apprentice, prepares his next victim.If you watched the first one, and made it through 5 or so Saw movies, you don't need to be reading reviews, you know you are going to watch it anyway. If you haven't seen the first one, I would recommend watching it before attempting to watch this one.F-bomb, shower nudity."
4,Very thorough,I'm now just less than half way through with this book. So far I find it very thorough and covers a lot of issues. The only problem I see so far is that it is full of typographical errors. The code examples are also full of errors. Overall I'm very happy I'm reading this book.
3,I don't think this is an awesome book,"I am amazed by the 5 star ratings everybody has given this book! And I have implemented several enterprise level security implementations/integrations supporting hundres of thousands of users.In my opinion, this book is really feeding the buzzwords frenzy of security domain. It certainly ""talks the talk"", but can it ""walk the talk""?I can think of numerous glaring examples where the book falls short. To name a few:- Smart Cards (lots of power point and management level sales fluff here)- JAAS (I have seen it being described much better in fewer words)- SAML (huh?)I think the book does a below average job of providing practical information. Even the content does not flow very smoothly and coherently."
4,I loved the video,"I received both All Things Horses videos as a gift for my daughter recently. She loves it. I just read the very negative review entered by a fella from California, and I think he must have been watching a different video. All the other reviews are very positive, so this guy must be on another planet. The videos I watched were clearly intended for young viewers and new horse lovers. There were sections on saddling up, different breeds of horses, the history of horses, and even an MTV type of section that cleverly used black and white footage to represent old time movies. The music was excellent and as advertised, my daughter has watched the both videos often and has become very attached to Henry the Horse. clearly, the negative review was written by an experienced horseperson, and not someone in the intended audience."
5,Excellent! Very entertaining for my 6 yr. old!,Mommy bought All Things Horses for me for Christmas. I like Henry the Horse because he makes me laugh. This Christmas Mommy's getting me a pony.
3,Fine,"It's fine, it is what it is. It's ultra-cheap press-board wood, but for a guest room or a kids bedroom it's fine."
3,Nice basic platform,good basic platform for daughter's room. Had to wait for two replacement pieces b/c two were broken in the box. (particle board).
3,About South Shores Platform Bed,Last year I bought a South Shores platform bed in a twin size. First of all it was a royal pain in the behind to put together. My friend Teri's boyfriend had to do it & he didn't seem too happy about that. Also I noticed that the screws kept coming loose making the whole platform loose. I think it would be a lot better if it was just 1 solid piece of wood rather than several sections. However I LUV the white finish. A word to the wise is unless you want to have to have a screwdriver nearby to tighten the screws a couple times a week don't waste your money.
2,Cheap Bed,"This is the first time I have been disappointed by something I have ordered on Amazon. It looks very nice in the picture, but I guess you get what you pay for. Not a big deal since I am just going to be using it for the next two years for college, but if you're wanting a nice bed I recommend looking for something else and spending a little extra money. The material is cheap, the boards don't line up, and if you try to move it, it just falls apart on you. So when setting it up, make sure you put it together right where you want it!!!"
2,quality not that good,"right, its not expensive item, so im not expected much. but when the item arrive at my house, its alrdy damaged. i know its over 100 lbs item, its kinda difficult to move it from the truck to the front door of my house. but i never expected that poor item loading. then i take out the item and check, obviously, there's scratch on some parts of items. i wish i can upload some pic, but i dont see any button i can click for pic uploading."
4,great for the price,"We bought this bed for our 1 year old since it was so inexpensive and low to the ground. There was no problem putting it together. My husband did it in about 40 minutes. I would recommend painting the surface that the mattress lays on because is unfinished and the brown shows around the corners of the mattress. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Also, make sure to position it where you would like it to stay, because once it's put together it's going to be hard to move. I wouldn't have expected anything better for the $110 we paid."
4,What a unique book!,"HOLD TIGHT caught my attention because I thought it satire, but after reading the book I found myself amused, touched and, yes, aroused. Bram's descriptions of NYC during WWII are particularily vivid, and his use of character is just as strong. I defy any hot-blooded homo not to be deeply aroused by the sex, including antiquated cruising on 42nd Street. This book reminded me a bit of Susan Isaac's great novel SHINING THROUGH, providing a unique take on the WWII novel."
2,This time with a twist.,"There are passages of this book that are so wonderfully sketched out that they seem to play as black and white movie clips inside the reader's head. No mean feat, the author has a real gift for transporting his audience. And of course, what's not to like about Hank Fayette? Yowzer. I'm not too familiar with the author's work, though I did read Surprising Myself when I was in college, but I bet he has a great American gay novel inside him somewhere. (Insert Richard Gere joke here.). Nice work."
5,It's probably one of their most original recordings ever produced,"This album is different than the other previous Conflict albums from the 80s. Colin Jerwood's voice is somewhat different, one of the songs sounds like a ska song, and some of the songs use the keyboard (even though the Ungovernable force used this too, but only the last song) which is used a little more. One thing is that the song ""These colours don't run"" is in this album, so you don't have to order that single of the same name and this. I still have a short way to getting their newer album, the singles collection and It's Time to see who's who now."
3,insights that are valuable but limited,"This book seems to be taken from someone's PhD thesis. It strikes a very academic tone which may be appropriate in some settings but to a general reader seems to reduce genuine feelings to nearly useless abstractions. For example, the book asserts that people are usually attracted to people who are more attractive than they are, as though there were some universal, absolute scale.More importantly though, the study is based on interviews with undergraduates. I find this to be a limited perspective on the breadth of human experience that can fall under the topic of ""Unrequited Love.""Still, some of the insights are revealing. Popular convention does not acknowledge how uncomfortable it can be to have to reject someone and it is useful to hear that side of it."
2,The one side of unrequitted love,"This book is pointless. It's a simple result of surveys with author's suggestions. Put yourself into position of a would-be lover and a rejector, and you've read the whole book. If you're heartbroken and looking for understanding, this book will disappoint you. It mainly focuses on the other side of unrequited love, the rejector, and seems to defend (using the data) that position as more hurt by the experience. At one point it even compared the would-be lover to a criminal! That definitely does not reflect the whole society. The only thing this book helped me realize is that romantic love is very much a selfish thing."
1,Thought it was just me but ...,"these are not the 'Sandies' I used to know and love. I thought it was just me, but then I read all the other reviews and felt I had to chime in.Why do companies have to mess with a good thing? If it comes to cutting the quality or upping the price a bit, I'd be glad to pay a little more."
1,Not what they used to be.... pretty nasty really,"I have been eating these cookies most of my life (and I'm no youngster). These cookies have changed. I bought a package of them today and took them back to the grocery store, thinking that something was wrong with them. They tasted funny and seemed kind of stale. They gave me a different package which solved the stale problem. However, the taste is just not good. I don't know what Keebler has done to these cookies but I'm done buying them. They are just flat out not as good as they used to be."
4,Finished product nice but a major size error,"We found the dresser somewhat easy to assemble however one of the three pieces on the back was the wrong length (an entire inch too long) and required that we adjust before completing the project. Other than this, the dresser is holding together nicely and matched the other piece we bought (Da Vinci Richmond Crib) nicely."
3,It's not perfect BUT...,"It looks very nice but it is a little flimsy. It took a little over an hour to assemble but I started it w/o my husband and got frustrated. After assembled, we found a strange 'crack/split' on the right side but it didn't affect anything and you can't see it unless you look for it so we decided to keep it. We bought it to use as a changing table/dresser and it will work fine for that, it just won't last forever."
5,Very Nice,"The product arrived as planned. The box was in great shape. I thought the dresser was going to be too small but when we got it put together, it was very nice. The tracks for the drawers are good quality. I am totally pleased with the item. I would buy from this place again.Da Vinci Roxanne 4-Drawer Dresser Finish: Espresso"
5,Great dresser,This dresser is the perfect size for a nursery. It is very nice looking for the money too. Really easy to put together.
2,Short on details - safe your money,Either there isn't much new in Office 2003 (probably not the case) or the book was rushed to market. Word was covered in three and a half pages while Excel only had two pages dedicated to it. You get the picture. Save your money until more books are available.
4,disturbing but thought provoking,"I agree with the other reviewer. There are disturbing parts to this book. For example, Evola's take on the Marquis de Sade is that the Marquis was bad not for what he promoted but because he didn't actually live the type of life he describes. I guess I just don't buy into Evola's underlying metaphysical scheme. It is important to note that this book is not a ""Tantric sex guide."" It is closer to a scholarly investigation of different sexual issues from the perspective of Evola's esotericism. Like Evola's other works, it is well-written and interesting. However, I don't feel as positive about its conclusions as I did with Ride the Tiger."
3,The sacred and the profane,"In a world where viruses are manipulated to protect the first worlders, and a leaf is chewed to control the third worlders, it is comforting to note that faith exists at all, and that the delving into questions of faith is still a worthy topic for discussion. The loss and recovery of faith is the most basic of human stories, which is why this book appealed to me so much. Could it be that the conflict of faith is exascerbated by the separation of the sacred and the profane? Are the concepts of sacredness and profanity useless societal constructs that when torn down lead to a much fuller realization of the potential of the human spirit? This book begins to examine these crucial questions."
2,Everything You Never Wanted Your Kids to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid They'd Ask): The Secrets to Surviving Your Child's Sexu,"I must have been confused about what this book actually was when I bought it. I thought it was a book for my child to read. It is more like a manual for me. It is more like a ""What to expect when you are expecting"" type book for your child's teenage years. It is mostly just common sense information."
3,Good place to start but not really grasping the big picture,"What I got out of this book is how to really look at what your beliefs are about sex and what of those do you want to pass on to your children and what messages do you want to change. Great message but other than that it was very repetitive and always fell back to ""when in doubt, tell your children"" Tell them everything and anything at any age and I don't think that is true. Just as many adults can relay stories that hurt them deeply because their parents told them too much as did parents who said nothing. I feel we need to know who we are communicating with, and respect their personality, their boundaries and what their needs are too. I think it's a good place to start but I'm going to keep looking."
4,AWESOME!!! But not quite enough.,"As much as I love these guys, this CD was a little disappointing. Don't get me wrong, the songs are HILARIOUS!!! But what about the hiphopapotamus vs. the rhymnocerous? There are a few other songs they should have included."
3,I want more,"I love the series on HBO and I love FotC in general, but this EP leaves me wanting more. The last three songs, which were recorded live, are worth having the CD, but I definitely want to hear a full-length album."
2,Look elsewhere,"It's simple. Don't buy this album. It really isn't worth it. Most of the songs are live, and despite that, not much additional content is provided to each song. They're really similar to the studio recorded songs, only with a few not-so-funny tidbits thrown in. Don't get me wrong, the Flight of the Conchords are awesome, but this album does not capture their best performance. I recommend buying the Flight of the Conchords original album (self named album/no name album). It's cleaner and clearer, better worth the money, and has a lot more content. Not to forget, most of the songs on The Distant Future album are also on the other album. So, it's a clear choice. You have two albums with overlapping song lists, one of which has more content (songs) and is a lot cleaner and clearer to listen to; buy Flight of the Conchords' original album."
2,Too short to warrant a higher score.,"I really enjoy The Flight of the Conchords, and really enjoy the songs on the CD. The problem is, the length of it and the small amount of tracks aren't nearly enough to satisfy.Also, because there are so few songs, there aren't many to chose from, and when you want to hear a little FOTC, you're hearing the same things again and again.I think the tracks with the high production values have more of a place on studio releases than do live songs, so I'd have preferred if The Most Beautiful Girl In The Room and Robots were studio tracks, and Banter omitted (or replaced)."
2,Shut up and sing,"The songs are funny, but oddly (as the shows are funny) all the in between banter is horrible. Shut up and sing already."
4,Out of this world,I bought these CDs for my little sister for her Birthday. When I asked her what she wanted this was flight of the concords. After I bought them for her i was able to listen to them and feel in love with them myself. Great witty lyrics.
5,Brilliant!,"Flight Of The Conchords is one of the funniest concepts since Ricky Gervais unleashed The Office. Alot of people won't get it which is probably why HBO almost cancelled their show. Unfortunately, they can't match the scary success of Sex In The City. The genius of their comedy is woven into their songs with such clever skill that it takes several listens to catch all the subtle hilarious references. Eventually, FOC will get the attention they so justly deserve but probably not until sometime in the distant future...the year 2000."
4,"Great CD, wish there were more songs!","The songs are from the first few episodes of the show, great with friends in a car. Wish there were more, but I understand that cd is coming out in '08"
2,A lot of diary entries,"I love Bobke. I love him on TV, and I will forever picture him, Chris Carmichael, and Lance Armstrong spending a week in North Carolina in 1997 (maybe early 98). They did long rides every day and Bobke basically convinced Lance not to drop out of road racing. We all know what happened after that as far as Lance's career goes.I wish he'd write about that week. (Maybe he has, but if so I'd have gotten that book I think.)This book is just a series of diary entries, nothing really to sink your teeth into. I read awhile and then skimmed to the end. Sorry, man."
5,Bobke Rocks!,"This book is a collection of Bob Roll's training/travel journal while racing in the Tour de France and the European circuit as well as his days as a mountain biker. There are random thoughts sprinkled throughout the book. The passages are not only informative about the day in day out life of a pro biker, they are laugh out loud funny. I also think Bob's attitude toward racing is awesome: He goes out and does his best and whatever happens, happens. He is stoked over a 30th place finish in a World Cup mountain bike race if he knows he rode his best or recovered from a flat or fall to earn that spot. A highly recommended read."
2,One for the Money,"I think Bobke is neat and cool; love the commercials; love the on-air analysis; love the persona. And if you really, really love Bob Roll, you might like this book. But be advised of its contents.The first thing to know is that the first half of Bobke II is a reprint of Bobke (I), which is funny because all of it (I believe) is reprinted from cycling periodicals. The journal entries are full full full of jargon and nicknames that you may well not get, and they are not developed enough to provide much entertainment. There are a couple of pearls and laughs in there, but you have to look pretty hard for them.If you are interested in the book, grab it at the bookstore or library and read chapters 22 (the one about training with Lance), 21 (the one about the euro cyclist who wanted to buy a Harley), and 8 (Lost in the Jemez). It will only take you about 20 minutes, and you can keep your $17."
2,Warning!! Bobke Triple Regurgitation Fraud!!,"I am a big fan of Bob Roll, ever since watching him face plant in a NORBA race at Big Bear. After enjoying his column in Velo News, I bought Bobke when it was published. Amusing read. When we got back from France in a TdF frenzy, I ordered his Tour primer, and thought my wife might enjoy more stories, so I ordered Bobke II.I didn't mind re-reading his columns in B-I, but to be sold the same stories twice, with minimal value add was insulting. The few new bits have such a 2004 speculative orientation, I am sure this book will become instantly dated.If you DO NOT own the original Bobke, and discovered Bob on OLN, perhaps Bobke II is of value. I just feel ripped off and ignorant for having been taken this way.I still love Bob, and hope he has continuing success. OLN's coverage would suffer without his knowledge and funk."
4,Great Laughs from Bobke!,"I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who has even the slightest of interest in competetive cycling/endurance events. I've always enjoyed Bobke's unique commentary on OLN, especially during the Tour. Bobke II takes the whole thing up a notch as Bobke reflects on a truly inspirational cycling career. Its great to hear what the Tour de France really feels like when you are just trying to hang in there to the end. And of course Bobke's colorful and diverse vocabulary makes it all the more enjoyable, even when we need to use his end-of-chapter glossary to decipher what nickname belongs to who. I especially enjoyed the chapter about Bobke's training camp with Lance Armstrong, in which we hear what its like for an accomplished pro rider (Bobke) to try to keep up with super-human Armstrong. Look forward to reading more of Bobke's zany ruminations. By the way, anyone ever see a copy of Bobke I??"
2,Not worth the money or the time,"If you want to learn more about riding, wrong book. First part is a sketchy outline of his diary for a few years. Rest of it is a hodgepodge of memories and rantings. He does have a wacky way of thinking and describing things. But, in a writing style and language that will likely appeal to 14 year old boys it has way too many nicknames, unnecessary swearing, nitwitticisms, etc. You have to be a hard core fan of his to give this book five or six stars. Maybe he has a good book in him but this isn't it."
2,I couldn't finish it,"I never thought that romance and sex could bore me so thoroughly. I felt as if the main character kept repeating herself. It just got old. The feelings expressed were often redundant and without much depth. Usually this does not bother me because I anticipate at least some hot romance and good dialogue. This book just didn't deliver it for me. In all fairness, I put it down half-way through which says a great deal since I am a tenacious reader."
5,Beast of a case,"Measured the case twice and it is on the ragged edge of carryon size limits.If you just measure the case it is fine,but Do they count the ridges and latches area?Time will tell but it may have been a better idea to buy the next smaller case if you want to be sure.The maximum combined linear measurement (length + width + height) of carry-on bags must not exceed 14 inches x 9 inches x 22 inches (23 x 35 x 56 cm) or 45 linear inches (114 cm).20 by 16 by 8.5 inches=44.5 case only////////////////////////////////////////1550 Case Specifications from PelicanExterior Dimensions(L x W x D)(L x W x D)20.62"" x 16.87"" x 8.12""=45.61 Total max measure.Good luck."
5,Just as promised,"Strong, large and quality. The handle is strong enough to pack it full of gold if you wanted.Great dark tone of black. Just...can't get a better case"
5,Great Box,THis is a great box. It perfect for all of my camera gear. I am pretty sure this box will last a long time.
2,Disappointing...,"I thought this book looked just great. And reading the introduction increased my enthusiasm. The discussion of common causes of disaster is both fascinating and educational.Unfortunately, the brevity of this book has resulted in a lack of crucial information. The staggering magnitude of the rock faces at Yosemite means that a lot of pages of topos are needed, and this book seems to have over-economized. We set out to climb the North Buttress of Middle Cathedral (DNB), and wandered back and forth for hours trying to identify the route from the scanty description. Nor was this the only disaster: we then wandered up the valley and repeated the sorry experience looking for another route.Verdict: very pretty, but if you are going to do any climbing, look for a more comprehensive guide instead."
1,keep shopping,"This book is not good at all. I lived in the valley for 2 months this summer and have learned to hate it. Despite the previous rating, Don Reid is DEFINITELY no master at getting you to the climb itself. He often has only a sentence or two telling you how to get to hard to locate climbs. Furthermore, the so called stars by the ""best climbs"" often mark some of the worst cracks...."
5,Toshiba 8-cell battery pack,"Received this product in a timely manner via ""free shipping"". Arrived in a Toshiba factory package inside a padded Amazon box for added protection. The product performs as adverised and is a significant improvement over the new 4-cell original as one would expect. I am happy I went with the 8-cell over the 6-cell with it's reduce terminal voltage (2 each 3 series connected battery cells connected in parallel). The penality for this additional power is weight and a small protrusion form the computer housing, but it is cosmetically well done. Good trade off, I am happy."
2,Dead at One Year,Would barely get 1 hour before battery would discharge. Died after 1 year light service.
4,Not worth the price,"This toy is durable and so far has held up to repeated battles (we bought the red one too). My only complaint is the price. We paid 19.99 for it and then found the exact same one at Walmart for under $9.00. (I think it was $8.43). It is a good toy, but shop around."
3,Does Not LIGHT up!,I spent about 30minutes trying to open the LIGHTsaber. I went back to the reviews and saw that it does not light up. Very disappointing. It is very durable and my kids like to battle with them. It would be so much more fun and cooler if it had a light.
3,Does not light up,"I did not realize that this toy does not light up. When the product review stated ""on/off switch"" I assumed it did. My 6-yr old son likes it, but it will not be much fun in the dark while trick-or-treating since it will not be able to be seen."
2,Light(less)saber,"This is an okay toy, but I guess in all the rave reviews for it, I missed the fact that it has no light source. My son was disappointed, but still plays with it from time to time."
5,well made,I was pleased that this product has stood up over time. I bought it a year ago and it is still holding together. (I have four kids!) So it is well worth the price you pay for it.
1,didn't survive shipment TWICE - It's junk,The first shipment arrived with the corner of one side broken off. I sent it back. The next shipment arrived even more damaged. Although I got a quick refund from Amazon - it was a huge waste of time and energy. Don't waste your time on this poor quality item.
5,"1/4"" barbed coupling for irrigation",This item does as it's supposed to. There are no leaks and the product does not break easily. I leave the item outside for the winter and I have no problems yet. I would definitely buy again.
1,"BUY IN HASTE, REPENT IN LEISURE!!!","Never buy a book without reading a page!!!! This book is NOT about Marilyn Monroe the movie star. It is about a MULE named Marilyn Monroe that was murdered in a mule train named after famous movie stars!!! So if I ever finish it, i will let you know. Right now I am reading the assassination of MM. It is text book style. Take notes and hope for a story-like chapter or two..."
5,Excellent,"This book has 4 cds with all the tunes recorded in a slower, practice version, and then up to speed. Also included are the guitar chords for the acoustic guitar accompanyment with each tune. The tunes are great- both for playing if you are more than a beginning player but also for learning your way around the tin whistle if you are a beginner. Altogether this is the best collection of tin whistle tunes I've come across yet. The author's Tin Whistle Tutor has some great examples of ornamentation, trills, etc. and also loads of tunes but I think if I were to get one book first it would be this, the Tin Whistle Tunebook."
3,Not the Best,"The Clarke Tin Whistle Handbook, by Bill Ochs, is a better book for beginners, and is really the definitive tin whistle tutorial. Advanced beginners or intermediate players who have worked through the Ochs book might enjoy Cathal McConnell's book. I'd also look into the Grey Larson Irish Flute & Tin Whistle book before buying Mr. McCullough's book."
2,Disney and kids,I did not find this book to be of great assistance. I found much more helpful information on the web. Allearsnet.com and magictrips.com were of particular help.
1,BEWARE - Worst customer service,"I was a Packet8 customer for 4 years. WHen I started to have technical problems after moving to Arizona, I discovered just how bad customer service can be. I opened a problem ticket describe the poor quality of connections I was experiencing. The problem ticket was ignored for months, and I could get no response even after multiple attempts. When I finally cancelled my service with Packet8 and transferred my number to Vonage, I foumd that the worst experience was with their billing department. Packet8 continued to bill my credit card for 5 months. I have as yet been unable to extract a refund. I reported the incident to the FCC and am waiting to see if they can help deal with this company. Don't expect help from Packet8 if you have a problem. Vonage has excellent customer service, so far."
1,This 3 port hub is really only a 2 port hub,"I have not had a chance to really test this hub, but 1 of the 3 ports must be used to connect to the computer. This leaves only 2 hubs for device connection. In my way of thinking this is a 2 port hub. Any hub I have owned in the past has a dedicated port used to connect the hub to the computer. It is advertized as a X port hub where X is the number of devices you can connect to the hub."
4,work great for non pros,these seem good for a small project or light use but they did loose hairs which is something one may wish to avoid in certain cases (high quality alternatives are much more expensive)
4,not as pictured here,"Product is great, but actual cable received looks different from website picture; it is not black, like most Monster Cable 2 cables, but marble, like previous Monster Cable 1 cables; printed label does not state ""Ultra-High Resolution"", but ""High-Resolution"" only.Overall, products seems to be fine. As a friend told me once, there is a point from where difference is not perceivable, at least not for amateur enthusiasts like us."
5,Fast paced and gripping,"This book is an excellent presentation of the two Schweinfurt missions of the US 8th Air Force in August and October of 1943. Although the author uses half of the pages for a rather extensive introduction to the main theme (including the explanation of the aerial bombardment doctrines of the era)the maps are marvellous and the story flows easily. This is probably the best short book on the subject, despite its age. The only drawback is that the Luftwaffe men are faceless and no personality of the ""other side of the hill"" is presented."
4,Purchased it because I needed a red cooler for Christmas party.,This was a great color for the family Christmas party. Only need it to keep pop/beer cold for one night. Worked fine and looked good.
2,Disappointed,"It's a cooler and at the end of the day, it's just going to be painted but the fact that it looked like the handles were held on there with some gorilla glue. Then the back hinged don't really bend back, they kind of bounce back and close on their own really sucks. Overall, just go to Wal*Mart to get your coolers. That way you can see if they look like they were glued together. The only reason I'm not returning it is because the shipping on it would be INSANE (like $13) and I'm just covering it in paint and it will be more a decorative item."
4,Amazing Study,"A fantastic, fully in-depth case for the modern worship of Dionysus. This book is a must for any serious Hellenist Reconstructionist."
2,Gloomy!,Starts out gloomy ends up gloomy. Not to mention boringly outcast. Has almost none whatsoever connection with the film. Won't play/listen to it again...
3,No Index!,"An otherwise great little book (anything by Ken Druse is worth reading) is made frustrating by the lack of an index. Very frustrating in fact--although there is a general table of contents in the front, you can't look up anything specific or even be sure it is covered. Too bad!"
3,80 Great Natural Shade Garden Plants,"The book is smaller than Natural Shade Gardening, and more of a reference guide than coffee-table inspiration book. The pictures are still excellent and the information about each plant is detailed."
2,80 Great Natural Shade Garden Plants,"Not so good. Just a list of plants for the shade. Expected more about shade gardening. Also, a very small book in size."
3,Polaris bag,"The bag was reasonably priced and arrived quickly, but it doesn't fit as well as the original one.Replacement Polaris Filtration Bags 280 All Purpose Bag"
4,Polaris Pool Sediment Replacement Bag Great!,"Product works well, bag collects almost everything, including the smallest of particles. I discovered you can also use the bag to manually to skim the surface because the dense fibers are able to collect very fine particles (although a silt skimmer would probably be much better). Arrived very quickly from the mail, safe and well packed. Thank you ThePoolMan. Only con to this product is that particles get stuck to the velcro that allows you to open and clean the bag. A little hose flushing usually solves the problem. Otherwise, great product!"
5,Works well. Inexpensive,You need to have these filter bags on hand because they don't last very long before they become torn and dirty. The good news is that through Amazon they are cheap so you can afford to replace them frequently and keep your pool sparkling.
5,Great bag; same as I bought at store for lots more!,"Great!..Thanks! True Polaris bag. why would pay more????? Will buy again. Buying tires next. And next year, this bag again...........!!!!!"
3,bag works fine but velcro sticks to the bag's mesh,Not sure why this occurs but the price was better than the polaris version. The only time you notice the velcro sticking is when you clean the bag out and it is kind of a pain.
4,Light and breezy,"Set in Wyoming shortly after WWII, this humorous novel is about a young boxer, Cowboy Shandy, who gets a shot at a career-making fight and wins it, only to realize boxing is not what he really wants to do in life. Shandy has a slew of friends in his small Wyoming town, and in conversations we are treated to Davis's views on suicide, honesty, economics, social equality, and many other concerns. Davis's tone is light and familiar, and though not as successful as his previous novels, the book captures our interest right away and carries us along effortlessly for the couple of hours it takes to read it."
5,Product Great for All Shapes,"This baby doll nighty is a great product!! I do not have the super model body, but this is perfect for any body type. My husband loved it as well. It's very comfortable, including the g-string; the lace is not itchy like other products I have ordered in the past. I would highly recommend this baby doll."
4,Overall quite good.,"The strap isn't uncomfortable, the iPhone holder on the strap is great.For normal use:It works wonderful, and it functional. I would recommend it to anyone.For cyclists:My only beef with this thing is that it tends to ride up the back if one is riding and the drops and that it shifts to the sides very easily if some real body movement is done while climbing, or accelerating. This can be annoying, but a swift elbow will knock it back into place.The pack also breathes well, compared to most. Most of the time, it doesn't feel like it's, there, but if you plan to pack a full patch kit, change of clothes, a laptop, and perhaps a waterbottle, the single strap design will eventually make your back hurt because 95% of the time, it's hanging off to one side just slighty, the remaining 5% it's flopped over, trying to fall off.I can't say I'd recommend it to any serious cyclists. The single strap design just doesn't carry against two strap bags."
4,Good deal,"This product has enough room for a good amount of stuff. It's not huge, though, and the shape makes it feel more compact. You could shove a standard sized notebook, a book, maybe a small lunch, wallet, and some other odds and ends: a bottle of water, sunblock, a few makeup products, bug spray, etc. I like the pouch for your cell phone on the chest side of the strap, as well as the variety of a couple different zippered pouches. The zippers are mostly covered so theft is deterred, and the bag is sturdy and well made - you won't have it sneakily sliced off you, and it won't rip or tear (maybe if you really beat it up). The price is very good too. I would definitely buy from this seller again if I came across another product I liked, because shipping was prompt.This bag could be used as a modest sized school bag (though it won't hold your kid's textbooks), travel pack, etc. I use it instead of a purse."
5,great bag!,"just fits my 13.2"" macbook pro, along with a water bottle, couple small books, and umbrella. love that i can easily check each of the several pockets without taking the bag off.the zippers could be a little stronger. so far they're holding up just fine however.very happy."
1,"Not worth the ""reasonable""price","Bought this because my 14 yo really wanted it for new school year. Zipper broke the 2nd week of school. My son's not hard on things and didn't over pack it or force the zipper. The price of $19.95 was attractive, but once the shipping was addded, it brought the damages up to $32.00. Buyer BEWARE! We're now back to using his High Sierra back pack from last year. I should have trusted my first instincts and told him no. Oh well...live and learn. M.B."
5,"Great 20"" sling backpack","Very nice product. Liked the fact that it is washable and dry's very quickly. Has ample space for carrying small items, not ment for carrying laptops, big notebook or binders. Nice touch with mesh pocket on the side for carrying a water bottle or beverage. Has a pocket for storing a phone or mp3 player with headphone slot. Three adjustable straps to reinforce the sides and bottom. Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Like the zig zag stretchable cord in the front for carrying odd ball things, good zippers and sturdy all around stitching. Product shows good workmanship, design and quality."
5,Perfect EDC,"I have been using this bag everyday for almost two years and have not been disapointed yet. Everything that I need for work from my pads and binders and ipad fit with room to spare. I have also really put it thru the mill and it keeps going.No rips, fading or any noticeable ware and tear. I would recommend this bag to anyone!"
1,Worst p.o.s. Bag ever,"This bag was a complete waste of money. Within a month, every pocket lining shreded! What a junk bag! it's so small too. Good luck putting extra clothes in there for the gym! DO NOT BUY!!!"
5,Best customer service ever!!!!,I originally got this backpack in September of 2011. The clip on the backpack broke. A man named Nick from the company contacted me about replacing the backpack at no charge. He told me about the issues the original backpack had and how the issues with quality had been fixed. He sent me another within days and my son tested it out and it is working out great!!! Best customer service ever. This company really cares about customer satisfaction. My son is very happy and I would definitely buy another backpack from this company. Kudos to them for caring.
1,worse product I ever purchased,"This is the worse backpack I have ever purchased. The first day I used it the zippers reversed themselves then they came apart. It has no stability to it at all. The lining ripped with just a small amount of contents loaded into it. I bought this product on the premise that it would serve the need for transporting my school books and accessories with the ease of having to carry it on one shoulder, boy was I fooled. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
1,What a Waste of Money,"I had been looking for this style of a bag for few months and was pleased to find this as it was exactly what i wanted, however after using this bag for only a few days I started to experience problems in the quality. The zip from the main pocket repeatedly kept breaking off which caused me to reattach it consistently. I only used this for carrying paperwork but found that i was unable to carry even a single A4 folder. After a couple of weeks i had found that the zip fastener had completely broken in two leaving me unable to open or close the bag. I wouldn't recommend this bag as it is poor quality."
4,"20"" Adventure Sling Messanger Shoulder Single Strap Daypack Backpack Bag",Nice pack .....Heavy material with strong zippers. Has plenty of room for all the essentials. I especially like the strap that doesn't cut into your shoulder. Good for people on the go.....
4,Great man purse,"I've had this pack for a little over a year now and except for a few small issues its been good to me. There are a couple of straps that are there to commpress the pack that fell apart about 6 months into use. I basically use this thing as a daily tote around bag with misc items in it. Its not quite big enough to carry my 14"" laptop but can fit if there's nothing else in it. It is not waterproof nor does it claim to be but keep things fairly dry in the rain, I do lot of cycling and this thing goes with me everytime. It is also small enough to bungee onto my rack. Overall I think its a great bag for the price."
1,Save Your Money,"By the time I realized the product was substandard, I had too much invested in shipping costs to make it practical to return. The bag itself is exactly what we were looking for, but the zippers were extremely cheap. One was off track when it arrived. The other came apart after a few zips. I was offered a $5 credit if I'd be willing to replace the zippers myself and avoid the hassle of a return."
4,Pleases a pick 8-year old and his picky mom.,"Great backpak. I ordered this for my 8 year old son who insited his bag be ""cool"". He loves it. It's sturdy, water bottles of just about any size fit in the side pocket and the strap on the front is great for keeping up with jackets, jerseys...Would have given it five stars if the main compartment was a tad bigger. A 1 1/2"" binder and 2 good size books fit but my impatient son has to work it in just so in order to zip it up. All in all, well worth the price."
1,crap,this products main compartments zipper continuously splits. eventually both zippers broke . i cannot recommend this product at all. i hope this helps u all outUpdate exchanged several emails with adventures bag . They initiated and offered a refund . My opinion of the bag i recieved remains unchanged but their customer service is impressive
1,"horrible, NOT worth the money","I bought this bag about three months ago in anticipation for my 2 week trip to Florida with my 7 year old. I should have paid better attention to the reviews in regards to the zipper issue. In a week's worth of everyday use, the zipper kinked and the next day it broke off from the track. And, of course, it has been more than 30 days, so the bag is not returnable. Will not buy from these folks again."
3,light weight,"As the review title says, it is light and small which is both its greatest advantage and biggest down fall. When I got it in the mail I thought the mailer broke open and was empty, it wasn't, the bag was in there, and it is just that light weight."
3,Great bag overpriced shipping cost,I bought this for my husband who cycles to the gym. He was looking for a single strap bag with lots of pockets. I am please with the bag but was charged a very outrageous shipping cost therefore I am only giving this item 2 stars. I would recommend going to your local REI and buying a bag there to avoid costs. Unfortunately for us we live in Japan and have to internet shop as we do not have access to such stores.
3,COULDNT FIT ZIP UP BINDER IN!,"i bought this bag for me so i can use it in school, and because i had one like it in the 5th grade, and i wanted one that was like it. turns out, you cant fit anything in this bag bigger than a 1 inch binder. any bigger, and there is a large bulge on the top, and it takes 5 minutes to zip up. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE!"
5,Like a time machine back to great memories of the 80's,"I had this album on vinyl when it came out in the 80's. The cassette copy I made of it then has been played so much it can't be played anymore. I love this album. I saw this concert tour in '86 and it's always been a favorite. (Heck, I have a small souvenir from that night in the form of a tiny bit of hearing damage in my right ear - our seats were a tad too close to the speakers on one side.) Their music gains a ton of power and emotion live, between the energy of the crowd and the impassioned playing of the band. The remastering for this release sounds excellent. Crank up the volume on ""Waterfront"" and ""Alive and Kicking"" and feel like you're back in the arena chanting along with the crowd. It's almost a religious experience. Highly recommended!"
5,'Simply' Live,"There are a handful of arguably excellent live CDs, Rush's 'Exit Stage Left'; Genesis' 'Three Sides Live'; Supertramp's 'Paris'; The Who's 'Who's Last'. And surprisingly, this double-album from 1987 ranks with said heavyweights. Even if you are not a Simple Minds fan, this is a better CD to own than thier greatest hits CD. Rarely do live performaces rate better than the orginal studio version, yet tracks like 'Sanctify Yourself'; 'Ghostdancing' and 'Alive and Kicking' exude a visceral rawness to which the listener (particularly on CD) feels the interconnectedness of the band with the audience. Its virtually impossible to find nowadays, but normally one can unearth this little gem at used record stores. Its well worth the search."
4,superb collection of Dutch folk singing,"You want a perfect collection of one of the most typical Dutch, or even better, Amsterdam singing stars ? The Dutch 'Hillbilly Shakespeare' ? This is your bet. Understanding a little bit of Dutch is a pro because the lyrics are tearjerking. And his way of singing does certainly fit the words. Anything is on this double CD, from pop, rock, waltzes, quicksteps and jives. Make your Dutch night an instant success !!!"
4,First 90 Days by Watkins,Great book. It laid out step by step process to help one to transition into his/her new position and be successful.
4,"Slightly second to Neff & Citrin, worth reading both","This is a fine book with a lot of substance, and I place it slightly second to Thomas Neff and James Citrin's ""You're in Charge--NOW WHAT?.""From my point of view as the reader, Neff & Citrin actually catalyzed me and inspired me into preparing a 100 day plan broken into 10 ten-day blocks, while Watkins is more of a manual with lots of useful checklists and suggested questions and so on, but between the two, Neff & Citrin actually drove me to the needed outcome: my own 100 day plan.Both are good. If you buy only one, buy Neff & Citrin, but I do recommend that you buy both, read Neff & Citrin first, and then cherry pick from Watkins--the cost of these books is trivial in comparison to the return on investment."
3,Work in the medical Field,"Okay so I am not a business woman...or maybe I should act more like one as I work in the medical field. In a field where it is easy to distance oneself from patients, I know that I can't. This book is geared towards a business type of leadership. I am a clinical practioner, not in administration. I am not sure that I will ever be in administration, BUT I think the prinicples this book reveals are practical. I probably need to act more in a leadership role. With health care costs rising and health outcomes not that great in the United States...I am glad I read this book in case the time has come to start acting as a leader in my own field. I would read this book you can adapt the principles to your own field of work. Thanks!!! I only gave this book three stars..even though well written, I did find it a bit dry for my own personal tastes."
5,Informative and challenging!,Answers many of the questions which the new CEO has concerning the First 90 Days. A book you will reread to glean the many insights provided.
3,Decent but Dry,"I purchased this book in concert with a promotion thinking it might be useful during my transition. While it was informative and on point, most of its lessons were obvious to any seasoned leader and frankly it was a very dry read.If you are new to management or have not had much developmental time in improving your management skill this book will be valuable to you. Leadership ? I could recommend a number of better books for the first 90 days..."
3,"Read first chapter eagerly, than lost interest","Good idea, looks good on book shelf in office :) But lost interest after 1st chapter..."
4,Great on its own -- outstanding in tandem,"As an executive recruiter, this is an excellent book for insights on starting the new job. As the executives who I place can tell you, every new job situation is different and canned formulas don't always work. I highly recommend combining this book with ""Sudden Impact on the Job"" by Susan Quandt - it's a powerful tandem. Quandt gets at the varied contexts under which new executives start their jobs by sharing the real-life stories of many prominent CEOs' experiences on the new job."
1,Disappointed,"I tried to read this book. I hate, hate, hated it. It was dry, boring and uninspiring. I much preferred First Time Manager by Loren Belker and Gary Topchik. I know this book has a lot of positive reviews, but it failed to capture my attention."
3,"food for thought, but not a panacea","This book is in a long tradition of 'expanded' magazine articles. There's more than enough content for an outstanding journal article, but when the concept is turned into a book, it's a bit thin. A least this example of the genre hasn't been hopelessly padded, so it gets one star for having some good ideas, a star for not wasting its readers' time (presumably more valuable in this context than the few dollars they spend on the book), a half star for not pretending to be more than it is (i.e., no claim to being the 30 second solution to all the problems any executive has ever had or will have) and a half star for being a fair value proposition.Incidentally, I gave a copy of this book to my son (he's a couple of years out of college and had just received his first promotion at a General Electric subsidiary) and his reaction was that its really intended for managers a few years further into their careers. I think he's right."
4,First 90 days review,I thought the book was well structured and does apply to several levels although probably more taylored toward the senior executive positions. What it does best is to force you to stop and plan your approach to being successful. It talks about early wins and about watching out for serious landminds that could jeopardize your future in your new job. Highly recommend.
2,Two hour movie with a 30 minute plot...,"There is some good material here. There is some sound theory here. Then there is about 150 pages of padding, fluff, and flower petals. ""Be adaptable"" is one way to frame the main theme of the book. Okay. Got it. I'm adaptable. Now what? Wait, I have another 100 pages of ""Be adaptable"".Note to the author: Nameless ""Case Studies"" aren't ""Case Studies"". They are fables. If you are telling the truth, prove your truth.All in all this book is dull as aluminum cutlery, and dry as as a cracker. If you are looking for the ""Strategy"" the book seems to promise, you will be left with your hand out."
3,"Good Information, Incredibly Dull Writing","I think the concept of ""The First 90 Days"" is a great one. This book covers so many different issues and potential hurdles that you have to respect the time and research that went into this.On the other hand, the tone of voice the author uses is so painfully dry and boring that you can't help but picture this book as being red by Ben Stein inFerris Bueller's Day Off (Bueller... Bueller... Edition) [Blu-ray]I really liked how Mr. Watkins devoted an entire chapter to building your team and explaining that it's okay to let even long time people go if they're not fitting into your gameplan or working well with others. I also like how he stressed through the entire book to be humble yet open and honest about your accomplishments. It's just too bad I haven't been this bored by an author's tone in years. I can usually finish a 250 page book in a few days - this took me nearly a month because it was so boring in tone and voice."
3,"Good premise, but I just couldn't stay interested","The overall thrust of the book operates on an important but easily overlooked truism: you must focus on accelerating your learning & decision-making to get off on the right foot and dictate the course of your success during that critical honeymoon phase at the start of a new position. Sounds smart. And the exercises starting off seemed like they'd point you in the right direction, identifying your strengths & weaknesses in tackling this goal. But I just couldn't get going with it. I got bogged down & exhausted with the jargon and buzzwords and business speak. Maybe this is why I'll never truly succeed in business. Business books are just too dry and, well, business-y, to keep me reading."
3,Helpful for new managers but not ideal,While I found much here to be helpful I disliked the academic almost text-book like feel of this book. I felt like it was an evercise in a college management class - soemthing not quite rooted in the real world. Helpful by not fully intergrated with real managment world. There is no question that much information here is useful but there are other sourses that are more readable.
3,Too textbook-like for my taste,"I found 'The First 90 Days' to be way too much of a textbook-like book for me. It was a slog of a read and really directed at those already in a high position of corporate leadership. I was expecting more practical ideas for the low to mid-level manager and found it had little to offer. This book assumes you already are in a position of great power within a corporate environment and in that context, maybe it's useful. But for the majority of us who aren't at that point on the ladder - it offers little."
2,I did not learn anything new from this book,"I felt ""The First 90 Days"" was full of common sense on how to succeed in a new position. It also offered half-hearted examples of why some executives failed. For instance, some of the advice I paraphrased below:- Figure out what makes your employees tick and how they fit into the role you have for them.- Understand that what helped you succeed in the last position might be your downfall in the new position.- Identify those who support or oppose you or who could do either depending on whether you can convince them to be with you or not.The text was so ""blah"" that it was hard to be engaged in the book and none of the advice that was peppered throughout was enlightening. I really think a high-level manager would be disappointed in reading this."
2,Reads like a textbook,"I was unable to finish this book because of how bland and boring it was. I expected to get some good general information about becoming a leader, but it is so specific about moving to a new leadership position from a previous leadership position that little of it was useful. It reminded me of trying to read my old high school textbooks."
3,Good guidance,"This book provides solid direction for individuals new to their roles no matter what the capacity. The book, however, is fairly boring to read."
3,A good overview of transition periods,"My background is as a teacher, which is in many respects identical to a management position. I am required to make connections, establish myself, and do my job diligently. This book describes many of the key points to make during a transitional period, but if you have already gone through a management transition nothing here will be new -- you probably already learned it the hard way. If, however, you are about to undertake your first major transition this is very good information. Recommended for managers entering their first new leadership position."
4,A very good book,"I'm never buy nothing before at Amazon, then I buy one book used and liked very much. The book was perfect, as like new!"
1,I can't get through it,"This is a formulaic manual for what to do if you get a management type position. Basically, do this, then this, ect. It is extremely dry. I thought it might be of benefit to me even though I already have been in my job almost two years. Wrong. This is a book to read before you start a new management position. It is for corporate management settings, and maybe industrial management, but certainly not retail management. I thought it did have some very good suggestions about interviewing those around you, above, besides and below you, in order to make the greatest impact. In fact, after reading it, I am fairly certain my new boss read it because he pretty much followed the formula to a tee. For most people this book is not going to be relevant, but for the upper echelons of the corporate world, it is likely worthwhile for them to read."
1,Compressed Fluff No Substance,"Did Mr. Watkins write this book because he had something to say or he just had to say something?Lots of words compressed in very little thought that offers any value... I wonder who these folks are giving this book a rating of higher than a star. If Amazon allowed negative ranking I would have done that as I feel I wasted my money and time reading pure garbage.. Harvard Press needs to be a little more picky in terms of what it publishes associations with books like these will diminish the message of any good ones they come out.The following is culled out from the book;""The root causes of transition failure always lie in the pernicious interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strength and vulnerabilities""Please draw your own conclusions."
4,Great guide to focus on the important things first..,"This book helps to focus the attention on the important things first, given the importance of the first 90 days I think it is worth read it and use it as a tool to ensure you start with the right foot."
4,"This is a solid resource, but don't buy it here","We utilize this book in one of our leadership programs.I would advise that you purchase it anywhere...except Amazon.We made two attempts ordering a sizeable quantity of the book - both orders went astray. The first arrived nearly a month after the promised ship date. The second order has yet to arrive, 5 weeks later.Yes, credit was prompty issued, once requested. But, if your relying on a product to help your business, you'll want to look at another business partner."
4,a useful guide,"I'd like to give a copy of this book to every newly promoted, transferred, or incoming supervisor. It is an excellent reminder of what is important in establishing rapport, communication, and direction at the outset."
3,Great for new managers,"I felt this book provided positive, solid advice on how to create your image and new role. I feel a person new to management or working in their first job would best benefit from this book. For someone who has been in the workplace for a while, perhaps not so much as alot of it is common sense, but common sense you gain from life experiences. I would actually rate it a 5 for new managers, and not consider it too helpful for those with experience."
4,"Useful, yet slightly academic","Several very useful tips and tools, yet tends to be dogmatic and does not flow as well as you'd like."
4,The critical 90 days,"Your first 90 days in a new position will determine whether you succeed or fail. The initial impressions that you make on your subordinates, co-workers and senior management continue with you for the duration of your tenure at your employer. Any good executive intuitively knows this. For new and upcoming executives - those who haven't yet developed that intuitive knowledge - this book can prove invaluable. It is designed to help you methodically assess the situation at your new company and to develop an action plan.Highly recommended. If you already know what you're doing, The First 90 Days is a good review. If this is the first or second time that you are changing companies or positions within a company, it could prove to be invaluable."
2,"Part good, part not-so-good..","This is an attempt to teach leadership. I don't believe that this skill can be taught. I agree with the book's idea that you need to establish credibility up front, by going after low hanging fruit, but I don't think that leadership can be taught. A leader is formed from their background in which character is built. I feel the time and effort that I put into this book would have been better spent on some other endeavor."
4,Many great ideas to think about!,"There are many original great ideas presented in this book which stand alone on their own merit. But perhaps the biggest idea of the book is for companies to view a job transition as any other business process- and subsequently look to optimize it. There are so many transitions in most companies in any given year, that having a process that makes more transitions successful and the new employees effective sooner should noticeably improve the bottom line. Most importantly, this book makes you think!Also noteworthy in this book is its straightforward organization- the book lays out 10 areas to consider during a transition, then dedicates a chapter to each, and concludes with a brief summary. The book also reads well, and has examples to clarify the 10 areas."
5,A+content. D- electronic format.,"As someone about to jump up the hierarchy into a new management role, I find the content of The First 90 Days to be really useful. I'm not normally a sucker for management how-to books, but this one reeled me in.I bought the Kindle version of this book for my iPad, and I am unhappy with the poor electronic formatting of this book. The text is fine, but the tables are a mess to the point of being almost unusable. I am a big fan of e-books, but formatting matters."
4,Great strategy guide,"There are a lot of excellent points in this book, such as forming useful alliances and being aware of battles that can and cannot be won. I found it to be a bit long though. The same points can be made in 1/2 the length, and the brevity woudl definitely help busy professionals."
4,Great for any new job!,"Nothing earth-shattering, but a great book that helps you focus on what you need to do to succeed in your new job -- things to think about, things to do, thinks to be weary of, and thinks not to do. A great guide to motivate you to develop a plan, rather than hapharzadly start your new job."
4,A Must Read,"Great book for all business leaders who are advancing to a new role or coming from the outside into an organization. Simple, easy to read with pertinent lessons for a successful transition."
3,Informative but Monotone...,"I enjoyed the informative content. It makes sense and brings to attention the many aspects of leadership, job, or career transition in a way that enables you to go into the change purposefully and effectively. I wish I had this under my professional belt years ago. The downside: the speaker was not very dynamic and could have been less monotone to keep the listener's attention better."
4,great book for beginner and senior leaders!,"Provides and easy-to-use, easy-to-read blueprint on kicking off your new leadership job. I am in healthcare and the principles carry over well. I am still in my first 90 days, so we'll see how it works out."
5,Great tool for transitioning new leaders,"This book is a great tool for any new manager or leader assuming a new position in the same company or with a new organization. From securing early wins to accelerating your learning, it really provides great ideas that help get you acclimatized quickly into your new role as a leader/manager. I highly recommend it!"
4,Jump start your new job,"This book will help you hit the ground running at your new job. You know people don't just give you enough time anymore to prove yourself. This book is full of tips to help you get things going quickly. If 90 days is not enough, just ask for more rope."
3,Mile Wide / Inch Deep,"This book is a wonderful source for understanding the development of Science Fiction Publications, but as far as the substance of the books themselves, very little attention is given to critically approaching their ideas. In broad strokes, Del Rey categorizes the different eras, but the text is couched in generalizations and a lack of critical approach to the material. It's also outdated."
5,Nice bag for large camera,"This bag takes Canon 1d Mk lll, 70-200LIS 2.8, 24-105LIS, 17-40L 4.0, tamron 90mm 1.2 macro and canon 1.4X extension with no problems along with (2) canon 580EX flash units and assorted polarizing lenses, cleaning equipment, manuals, and tripod attachments. What else can I say?? I know, it's heavy (not the bag, the equipment). To carry this much stuff, you need the Post Office strap."
4,HP PAV 6226 Notebook,"(2 weeks after purchase) Great machine loaded with more software than Bill Gates' broom closet. If you're going to be doing alot of memory draining work, I suggest ordering an extra gig of ram (it comes with 1 gig,with 2 gig max). This PC is for my wife, and she basically does email, Excel, music , so 1 gig works fine. Vista is a work of art and very easy to use. Amazon did a gret job on the transaction and delivery.8 months Later:The HP PC's are TRASH in my opinion. I bought the DV6226US in March 2007, and my System Board fried just 7-1/2 months later. They replaced it, and 8 months later if fried again - and HP wouldn't cover it. With the excessive heat no wonder! A system board crashing is rare but 2 boards in 16 months is nothing but defective product - pure and simple. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT"
1,Don't work dependably even on Monster Cable,"I have a Home Theater system and used the Monster Cable white bulk cable to wire my system. I bought these to terminate cables for remote speakers into a Niles speaker box. While I don't think the Niles speaker spring clips are particularly dependable, these connectors were big disappointments and unreliable to the point that if you moved the speaker box at all, some of them would come loose. They did not grip the cable satisfactorily, their insulators kept falling off, and were generally unacceptable to handle heavy gauge cables.I use a lot of monster cable products, but these were a huge disappointment."
1,"Dangerous, cheap clip lets dog break free!","I had the same experience as another reviewer (see additional listings for this leash) - less than five minutes into the first walk my dog popped off the leash! We live in a city and she is not car savvy, so it was quite a heart-stopping moment. After getting her home safely, I tested the clip by attaching the collar and pulling it in the direction of the pin - it popped open and released the collar ring with very little pressure! I had this problem with another leash, but (naively) trusted this one because it was from a 'good' manufacturer - never again! This appears to be another cheap, untested 'made in China' product. I will never walk my dog without thoroughly testing a leash again and will probably go back to using a carabiner as an extra reinforcement on all my leash clips. The lesson: when it comes to buying any dog/leash or collar, BUYER BEWARE!"
4,"They must have fixed the problem, I haven't had one","I read the other users' concerns before buying, and bought anyway because I have had success with Premier's products. I also purchased the martingale-type collar that goes with this leash. I have a 40 pound cowdog mix who pulls pretty hard on walks, and I must say that I had none of the problems the other reviewers experienced. Premier must have fixed the problem, or it may have been unique to the other users. Granted, I haven't tried this leash out with a 90 pound Lab. I give it four starts only because Premier seems to cheap to manufacture their products in the USA. It's good quality for Chinese-made goods, but the metal doesn't have the heavy, Made in the USA feel to it. I still recommend wholeheartedly."
5,It works as advertised,It hasn't fallen apart so I supose that's all that matters. Good deal on a leash if you need one for your pet.
1,Dangerous,I bought a premier leash in 08 and it released my dog several times. Freaked me out. I've had no trouble with the collar but wont be buying the leash again.The function of a leash is to stay connected to the dog. Whats up with that Premier! NOT COOL! Hope its been redesigned.
1,Do not buy this leash!,"I bought this leash at the animal shelter where I adopted my dog. Even though it's only been a week, this leash has come off of his collar twice. As soon as I got my dog safely home, I sat and figured out what the problem is. The reason it pops off is the ring on the collar twists up against the trigger and pushes it back just far enough to release the ring. It WILL happen eventually if the ring gets in the right position. In my case, I was using this leash with a Gentle Leader collar. The ring on that collar is a very small diameter and round. I think this leash might work better with a collar that had a D-ring of a very thick diameter, but I'm not willing to risk it.I have another leash with a smaller more rounded trigger. I tried the same set up and I was unable to pop the trigger.If you already own this leash, consider replacing it or figuring out a backup method to keep it attached when it does fail."
1,Low quality - Possible counterfeit,"This leash is poorly made. It doesn't feel very durable, the swivel on the clasp looks far too thin and loose to withstand much stress. In addition, the clasp doesn't swivel properly which causes the leash to tangle. Also be advised that the length may be incorrect, I ordered a 6' but it measures 5' 6"" (which rules it out for obedience compitions). I suspect this is a counterfeit, as the quality is not consistent with other products manufactured by Premier, it lacks the sewn in tag found in Primere's other nylon gear (the leashes pictured on their website also include a tag), and the packaging and labeling looked suspicious. You typically get what you pay for and if something looks too good to be true, then it probably is."
5,Christmas present to son-in-law,Service was great and item was new.He is thrilled and all is well. X-acto has always been quality.Thanks Santa!
4,No more cheap painted wooden toilet seats,"I was tired of the cheap painted wooden toilet seats that I purchased in Walmart. Over a short period of time the paint started to chip and look pathetic. So I searched Amazon to look for a nice plastic toilet seat. I chose the Kohler K-4689-O Cachet Round Closed-Front Plastic toilet seat, white. I am happy that I did. I should have purchased it a long time ago. I like it very much."
3,Classy looking but not a comfortable seat,I spent a lot of time shopping for two different toilet seats for our two bathrooms and this one was the 'expensive classy' looking one. It definately is the nicest looking toilet seat I've ever had. The only problem is that it is not a comfortable seat and also I hesitate to ever put the lid down as it is slowly making two big marks on the seat. NEVER stand on the seat as it is not stable and really gouges the seat. I still really like the seat though because the beige color matches my toilet perfectly and it really does look good.
2,Mounting screws,"The plastic mounting screw design has to be the worst I have ever encountered. they are not like your traditional plastic mounting nut and bolt(why do they keep trying to reinvent the whee). The seat has these open slots in the back where they are slid into this half witted bolt assembly. After struggling to get the seat mounted, they eventually work there way loos and have to be remounted. It has become a part time job.The seat color and the seat itself are perfect, if the mounting brackets where like the original seat I would have rated it 5 stars"
3,"""Tea Green"" Not Very Green","I can barely see any ""green"" in this. Looks more off-white with the slightest tint of green...maybe.Material seems very good. Expect it to last a lot longer than a painted wooden seat."
3,A collection of essays but not too many stand out as excellent,"I loved the concept of this book and it sure has a diverse set of topics of leadership but I really searched and wanted to get some ""a-ha"" moments of wisdom.. didn't get them. Staying positive I did enjoy the leadership messages about how to work with (for ?) the next generation of employees. I believe it was Cathy Greenberg-Walt who wrote that chapter. There are specific ideas buried in this book for considering the top talent of writers I simply had the highest expectations.In summary, worth your time reading but don't expect life changing ideas."
4,Outstand leadership text,Well written - concise with little wasted rhetoric. Excellent text: I would recommend it to anyone with more than basic knowledge of leadership principles.
1,poor!,"I bought this cover about a year ago and it's ripped, peeling, and pretty much useless. STAY AWAY. Customer Service is useless... told me I need the warranty and store receipt. Who sends in a warranty and keeps the receipt for a $20 grill cover, unless you've been burned before. I'm done w/ Char-Broil"
2,keep out of sunlight,"This cover fits well and seems A-OK out-of-the-box, but it doesn't hold up if exposed to direct sunlight. I've had two of these and each one only held up for one year. If you keep your grill in a covered area you should be fine, but mine is exposed all year and this cover just can't hold up. I saved my receipt on the 2nd one and I'm returning it today (at my cost) to get a replacement under warranty."
4,"Char-Broil 65"" Full-Length Grill Cover, Green",Very good product--has held up well covering the grill under our small patio in the back yard. Arrived quickly after ordering.
5,AARRGHHH! EPIC EPIC EPIC,"put this cd in a huge stereo system, get drunk, put it on the last 15 seconds of song number 10 and your head will roll off! GUARANTEED! Also as soon as the vocals enter in song 4 I either want to cry for joy or murder an english crusader!"
3,nice... but i've seen better...,"This is a nice play yard and we have gotten a lot of use out of it but I'll be honest- the grandparents purchased similar ones by Graco and I wish we had one of those. I just found that they are a bit nicer and easier to use.PROS: the colors are more compatible with normal decor- giving your living-room a less ""BABY"" feel, Assembly was relatively easy- except the directions were pictures rather than words, the music and night-light are great and the remote is very convenient and worked well.CONS: the changing table is quite low- making it tough on the back, the vibrate option is totally undetectable! we would turn it on and press down on the bassinet portion of the yard and could not feel a thing! The mattress is not very comfy- our daughter will not sleep in it but she slept fine in the Graco one at Grandma's houseIn a nutshell, this is not a BAD play yard per se', I have just seen nicer ones and would have made a different decision had I known then what I now now."
1,Vey bad does not clarify much,This book was bad to say the least i found my slef asleep after reading this book! this is a bad but for anyone! reading the book was a waste of my life!
1,1 star too many!,"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've ever read!.Guiding Light unwisely choose one of the most unpopular ""stars"" of the show for a book! Those 'trashy romance novels' will seem like Hemingway after reading this!The woman who plays Lorelai isn't a writer either!!I only gave it a star because there's no option for ZERO!! Don't bother buying it!!"
1,Wasted money,"What has GL come to that they actual gave this disliked character the opportunity to write a book? GL is getting spooky. Picked up a trick from Passions, which worked well for the teen soap. Save your money for a better purchase."
1,Really deserves - 100 STARS!,This book that is being promoted as part of GL's 50th Anniversary is the biggest farce. The grammar and sentence structure are at best that of a third grader. The content is incredibly boring and full of run on sentences. I continued reading hoping it would get better. About half way through I gave up. It is a good thing that I split the cost with 10 other people. Of the 10 only 2 thought is was mildly entertaining. Best bet is to skip this book altogether.
3,Not a bad read,I missed GL during this time period but the book was very interesting and like reading about it. I have not watched GL a lot thru the years so I dont know her true backstory and the book delves in L. Hills story that it leaves some holes in the story that I wish I could have been given.
3,Lorelei's Diary,"I did realize that Lorelei's Diary was actually published. I remember watching the show and seeing the Beth/Lorelei story unfold, however I don't remember it being advertised. The story jumped around in the beginning, however in the end I was glad that I read the book. It was a gap filler for me."
1,Buyer Beware,This bed does not include a frame.They charged $80.00 plus dollars for shipping for something that weighs no more than 15 pounds.
4,Enjoyable and easy to read.,Liked the short story format. Can pick it up and read it any time. I could identify with the author in her every day experiences of life. There is always an uplifting thought when you come to the end of a difficult experience. Is a reminder that all things happen for a purpose and God is in control even when I'm 'frazzled.'
4,Long needed reissue.,"Red Sovine has long been in need of a serious career retrospective CD, one that looks at both his honky tonk and trucker hits. The wait has been worthwhile because Ace has done its usual bang up job and given us a wonderful collection with excellent liner notes by Ronnie Pugh. All of Red's hits are here, including trucker classics like ""Giddy Up Go"" and ""Teddy Bear."" Few people can deliver sentimental fare with as much sincerity as Red did, and he always seems to be able to elevate material that would otherwise be mawkish. Red makes his listeners feel his sincerity in each and every track. There are some very good honky tonk numbers here, with a classic rendition of ""Why Baby Why"" leading the pack. Redd's music is solid country from the 50s to the 70s and very enjoyable. This is a long needed reissue that fills a hole in the classic country catalog. Dare we dream of a Bear Family box?"
4,COUNTRY GONE BY!!,"I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS COLLECTION OF HITS BY THIS ARTIST, FOR A LONG TIME! I HAVE PURCHASED OTHER COLLECTIONS BY ""OTHER"" SOURCES, SUCH AS (TV GREATS), ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED BY 'SO-CALLED' ORIGINAL HITS!! I AM 61, AND WAS BACK THEIR WHEN MOST OF THESE SONGS CAME OUT! TAKE IT FROM ME, YOU WON'T FIND ANOTHER COLLECTION OF ORIGINAL HIT RECORDINGS ANYWHERE ELSE!!! LARRY"
3,A bit more than expected,"The disconnect hose I ordered was advertised at 4 feet long. The one I received was 12 feet long. It works just fine, but I have an extra 8 feet of hose coiled up behind the grill. It's not a big deal, but if I wanted 12 feet I would have ordered 12 feet. Only needed 4 feet....RS"
5,Great Easy hook up,I got this item to replace the other one I had that some crazy squirrel chewed through and caused a gas leak. It hooked right up without having to modify the hose. The last one I had with a older gas grill had to be cut and spliced in. Not this one. Thanks can't wait to grill tonight.
2,"10 foot hose, not 12",I suppose a hose is a hose but I was expecting the length to be 12ft not 10ft. Otherwise I've no complaints.**Just got round to setting out my gas connection and notice that the 3/8 male-male connection isn't there. So I'm forced to knock off a star to 2*. It's more annoying than anything. The part isn't expensive but it's bothersome.
1,"Not my kind of music (and definitely not Alien Project, the psytrance performer/dj)","I bought this cd, thinking it was psychedelic trance. Unfortunately this cd turned out to be a band and doesn't even come close to dance music. And although I do like alot of music from the 80's and 90's, I don't like this cd."
5,Genuine music from the soul!,"To hear Raphael's songs, you know the lyrics were not just made up to please his listeners. They come right from the soul from where times of worry and suffering were replaced with faith, love and hope. There is a genuine feeling of comfort that comes from Raphael's songs which will keep you company and give you strengh in your every day lives!I know, because when the going gets rough, those songs are playing in my head, and they keep me moving onward!!Enjoy!"
3,"works well, not a good fit","This works fine, but I'm disappointed the extension pieces are not the same color and not the same shape as the fixed pieces."
5,Cookbook or Coffee Table Book-Some of both!,This cookbook is both delicious and informative. There are wonderful ideas presented and loads of information about the Mobile area. The recipes are both easy and exquisite. Don't miss out on this one!
5,Great addition to cookbook library,This is a beautiful book full of fabulous recipes! I have tried many of the recipes and they have all turned out very well. This is an especially good resource for shrimp and all other types of seafood recipes as well as recipes for wild game. This book also includes many easy and elegant side dishes.
4,good but Velcro can scratch under chin,"This is a great wearable blanket. It holds up well after numerous washings. However, the Velcro tab that covers the end of the zipper has scratched my baby's chin and neck a few times. She's on the chubbier side (meaning she has some adorable fat rolls under her chin) so perhaps this wouldn't be a problem for a skinnier-faced baby. I continue to use it but I'm careful to close the Velcro tab so little of the Velcro is exposed."
5,Detailed Detailed Detailed!!,"For someone who knew nothing about mushrooms, this book provided a wealth of information on how to find them, how to cook them, how to identify them, and which ones to stay away from due to their poisinus properties. If you want to learn about mushrooms, this is the book to get. The color photos made it real easy to see which ones they were talking about at any given time."
4,No book quite like it.,Short on mushroom IDs but the best for recipes. A must have for the serious shroomer.
5,Just Getting Better,"I absolutely adored this CD, mostly because the music is so different and the band seems to have such a creative force in music-making. If I was forced to pick a genre for this release I would say 60s psychedilic influenced new-new wave. Standouts include ""Publish My Love"" and ""California"" but any song would honestly give you chills.Also, if you enjoy this band, be sure to check out thier first CD, ""Out of the Shadow"" for more of a experimental 60s influenced sound."
5,Phenomenal album,"Love, love, love this album. It flows so nicely...everything is so melodic, yet you can rock out to it at the same time. This album is perfectly composed. It's hard to take it out of the CD player!"
2,Planned Obsolescence,"This smoothie maker works exactly as advertised: it doesn't leak, the motor is powerful, & the pour spout is a nice touch. The problem is, like every other blender, the clutch-gear (the fluted piece of rubber which connects the blades in the container to the motor) wears out. Eventually, the mating gear at the bottom of the container chews a clear path through the clutch-gear. The result is that the motor spins freely but the blades are not engaged & the smoothie maker is useless. I've gone through TWO of these machines. If it were an American brand, you could buy and replace the clutch-gear for $2.98, but I have been unable to find parts for this import anywhere on the web. This smoothie maker would be a bargain *IF* you could replace the part. Since you can't, it's overpriced for the short period you get to use it."
3,Works great until it breaks!,I loved it for the few months that it worked. Then the small handle that opens the handy spout broke off. Now I can't dispense the smoothie out of the blender and it is not nearly as convenient. I haven't had the chance to try to replace the spout. I actually bought mine at Costco and noticed the display model was missing it's spout. Someone must have had the same problem I encountered.
2,Loved it -- Until it Broke,"This smoothie maker was fantastic, until it broke during the fifth time I used it (I only owned it three weeks). The drive gear broke on mine as well and I did follow the directions EXACTLY. I agree with the other reviewer totally! It WILL break. And you WILL NOT be able to find parts for it. Buy something else!"
2,Works great until it beaks,I've used mine 3 or four times and the stirring stick started to come apart the first time I used it. It completely broke the last time I used it. Now the handle on the jar has broken off. I am taking it back before it completely comes apart!
1,Garbage! Buy The Competitor Instead!,"My wife received this model as a Christmas 2004 gift. First setup out of the box, done correctly, poured in the milk only to see it leak out the bottom of the pitcher all over and behind the counter! Triple checked the directions, took apart, put back together, tested with tap water, again it leaked out the bottom. What idiot designs/makes any liquid mixer WITHOUT a gasket at the bottom! Directions and manual do not show nor include a gasket to prevent leaks. Total garbage! Bought the competitor Villaware; much better quality and results! 12/27/2004"
1,Breaks easily,Don't crush ice with it or it will break! The motor will work but the blades won't turn. Junk.
2,Looks better then it works,I have to say that I was so excited to buy this blender but it has not lived up to all the features. I have found that its leaks when you pour from the spout and today the spout just broke off. For the $59.99 I paid I thought it would have worked much better and lasted longer. I am very disappointed.
3,Worked well until it started leaking,"This smoothie Plus 600 worked very well for a few years. But we don't use if all the time. In fact, it mostly sits on top of the fridge until we need it. Recently, it started leaking though. This could be because my teenager was a little rough on it, not sure. The housing for the blades cracked, it tried using super glue to fill the crack and after I re-assembled it, I couldn't find the gasket so now it's useless. Also, I'm trying to find replacements parts but so far, no luck. I gave this item 3 stars because it worked very well but cracked and leaked after about 3 years. I think a blender should last longer than that."
4,more than just shopping,"It always seems like people go to Chiang mai to shop for wooden bits and bobs, old cloth and bronze knicks knacks, then they go and play about on a hill tribe 'farm' and take pictures of over exposed and abused hill tribe people whilst riding on elephants and trekking in the so-called rain forests of the golden triangle. I was really glad the groovy map avoided all that trash and gave travelers like me something else other than faux idyllic versions of chiang mai. Easy map, fun writing and basically good stuff . I like Ching mai alot and have been going there for many years so I was happy to see a guide that didnt fall into that jaded tourist trap."
3,"buy it for the cuts from ""Double Dose""","In a perfect world Hot Tuna's ""Double Dose"" would be readily available on cd...in a really perfect world DD would already be remastered with bonus cuts...and in that perfect world we'd call this release a rip-off. BUT, the world isn't perfect and DD isn't readily available (yet) and so this has to be counted for what it is - the best single source for cuts from DD currently available.This is all previously released material. 4 cuts are from the first Hot Tuna lp (Know You Rider, Uncle Sam Blues, Don't You Leave Me Here, and Death Don't Have No Mercy) and the other 6 cuts are from DD (Funky #7, Bowlegged Woman Knock Kneed Man, Genesis, Embryonic Journey, I Wish You Would, and Watch The North Wind Rise).It's ALL good! But the only reason to buy this is for the otherwise mostly unavailable cuts from DD. Until DD comes out, this'll have to do!"
5,"Clear, concise, & to the point","Okay, I completely aced this class, so maybe I'm prejudiced! :-) This book is well organized, and keeps the extraneous info to a minimum. The facts of each case are given, the rulings of lower courts (with reasonings), then the decisions of the US Sup. Court (majority and dissenting if applicable). Paying attention to the considerable footnotes was my ""secret to success,"" along with copious notes. This book is an excellent tool for a student who pays attention and wants to get the ""A."""
2,It does the job but it's flimsy,"I recently went through another Windows XP meltdown (thank you Bill) and decided to get a new HD to use strictly for data storage. I got an internal for cost reasons and needed an enclosure. After a long time looking for the right one, I found one that offers both SATA and IDE connectors.Once connected the product does it's job - connects to the PC and stores data. But it's built like a grade-school shop project. Cheap aluminum held together by screws, hot glue gun and a lot of luck.The IDE and SATA connectors are short and stiff so you really have to wiggle to get your drive inside. The power cord barely fits in a socket and the moment you breathe on it it falls out.But the most annoying thing is the rattling. This thing is put together in a way that every time the HD spins it rattles like crazy.Go find yourself another product. I'm giving it 2 stars only because I was able to recover my data quite nicely and quick thanks to the USB 2.0."
1,This thing Really is trash!,Attachments are poor. The Power cable doesn't stick to the drive well. a single move will crash the drive.
4,External IDE/Sata HDD Enclosure,The product is as stated in the advertisement. It does rattle sometimes so I place a small piece of paper on one side. It works just great with all of the HDDS I have so far. I would recommend this enclosure to anyone. I just hope the connection for the power works over a period of time I have had similar ones fail after a year. I will see.
2,Disappointed,"I eagerly awaited my copy of this guide book only to be very disappointed with the actual book. The author does not go into any great depth about any of the rides, attractions, or shows. The maps, what few of them there were, are small and cramped. The restaurant and food places did not contain menus as I expected, but, rather, short blurbs on the general kinds of food served. A better choice for the reader would be Kelly Monaghan's ""Universal Studios Escape. The Ultimate Guide to the Ultimate Theme Park Adventure,"" or the sections on Universal Studios in Rita Aero's ""Disny World. The Essential Guide to Amazing Vacations."""
2,Informative - Except for the Errors!,"This book was helpful as far as hotel info, and attraction info goes, However, there were more than a couple of errors that made it a little frustrating. We ordered this book because we wanted a good idea of what rides would be appropriate for our children's ages and heights, etc. There were a few rides that had one height requirement on one page, and then a different height requirement on another. This book was helpful in some aspects of planning our trip, but the discrepencies with ride information was not a help. I now wish I had ordered something else."
4,Fun to read,"I purchased this book for my grandson so he could plan his vacation in Orlando. I enjoyed reading it too and found some ideas to pass on to him. The book was in excellent condition, shipped promptly and well packaged."
5,why nutrition improves life,"This book is straight-forward, concise, logical,and well-organized as it demonstrates which specific cellular functions are connected to disease. The author's credentials are impecible, scholarly, very observant, with outstanding recommendations drawn from his immense amount of research on biochemistry."
4,"Atlanta Rhythm Section's "" eufala""",Hi folks - it's great to see these guys are still around ! I only have 'Red Tape' and 'Champage Jam' on vinyl - they still sound fresh - and this newer release is a good one.
2,Nothing New,"This book is overpriced for its lack of new information especially for advanced students on the topic. One irritant: the author repeats old information, notably about the tektites being considered terrestrial impactites in origin. He ignores a considerable body of data which suggests tektites are extraterrestrial (ironically an old idea which is getting some renewed attention today)."
4,Great case,"I bought this case for my studio lighting gear, and it holds a bunch of gear.....primarily 4 strobes and 2 battery packs, along with a lot of other odds and ends stuff like clamps, light meter, cords, gaffer tape, etc. I will definitely be buying another 1654 for the rest of my location lighting gear. I only wish that the dividers didn't seem so flimsy, but I guess I'm spoiled with the Think Tank stuff.....better quality dividers would give this 5 stars. Oh, and fully loaded this thing is pretty weighty. It's a lot of fun lugging up and down 3 stories with no elevator."
2,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"PROS:XM INTERFACEIPOD INTERFACE60-200HZ SUB OUT ROLLOVERBASS BYPASS FOR EACH CHANNELTONS OF SETTINGSCONS:XM INTERFACE (REQUIRES SEPERATE ANT.)THE SOUND! (CAN THIS REALLY BE A YAMAHA?)WPC MORE LIKE 60-65 (HOOKED UP A POWER METER)So, I love Yamaha's natural sound line, and I am fussy. I used to own the rx-v2090. After a week of auditioning this receiver I returned it and went back to my 1986 100wpc Realistic from Radio Shack with Mach two speakers. The frequency range was just weird. Just lows and highs, no mids, could not make out dialogue when viewing a movie, no matter the volume. Oh well!"
3,Fascinating Look at the Past,"Betty Bandel's letters about her service in the WACs provide a fascinating glimpse into the life of a high-ranking WC during WWII. Why do I only give this book only a 3 star rating? I wish she had focused more on major events of the day--e.g. D-Day, the death of Roosevelt, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's disappointing that such an intelligent and capable woman ignored ""big picture"" issues in her personal correspondence. Contrast the diaries of Mary Chestnut, who was deeply involved with the issues of her day."
3,'COLORIZED' MUNSTERS KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED! PLOT IS BORING.,"IT'S GREAT TO SEE 'THE MUNSTERS' IN COLOR FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS THE ORIGNAL CAST. ALL EXCEPT MARILYN. AND IT WAS FILMED BACK IN THE '60's WHEN THEY WERE IN THEIR PRIME. NOT LIKE THE NEWER ONE CALLED 'MUNSTERS REVENGE'. THEY WERE MUCH OLDER IN THAT ONE. AND DIFFERENT WRITERS. (DON'T RECOMMEND) BUT IN 'MUNSTERS GO HOME' THERE'S SOME HUMOR. BUT NO LAUGH TRACK. AND THE PLOT CAN BE SOMEWHAT BORING AT TIMES MAKING THE MOVIE DRAG A LITTLE. WHATEVER SCENES HERMAN GRAMPA AND LILLY ARE IN ARE INTERESTING. THERE'S ALSO SOME GREAT FOOTAGE OF THE 'MUNSTER KOACH' AND GRAMPA'S 'DRAGULA'. OVERALL, IF YOU ARE A MUNSTERS FAN-YOU'LL LOVE IT!"
4,Great - A 60's Classic,"The Munsters go to England, and of course end up in a car race. Grandpa builds a race car from a spare coffin, Herman drives it to a win. The race car was a variation of the George Barris ""Drag-U-La"" classic. Of course it was absurd to think Herman could win a race with the drag tires front and rear, but then the Munsters is all about suspension of disbelief. I have fond memories here, the Munsters was about the coolest show you could watch back in those days and George Barris was everywhere! I've got it on DVD; but unfortunately there is not a ""making of"" or retrospectives by the surviving cast."
5,I love old movies,How can you not love this movie. It is so much fun and I am very happy I found it.
1,no goodtimes video for me,"I love this movie, but not the dvd. I buy dvd's for it's original screen format and the extra's this video has neither. Goodtimes video has formatted the movie strait from the vhs version."
3,You Have To Love The Munsters Or Don't Bother,"Unless you are a big Munster fan, don't bother with this movie. I am not a Munster fan, and I could not finish it. It is just too silly. Time can be better spent elsewhere.Comedy (AMC 340/2)"
2,Weak collection,"Yes,the songs on here are good,but it's missing too many of her other hits.Where's ""Let's Go To Vegas""? Or what about ""Take Me As I Am""? This collection should have been ALOT better.I would recommed just buying her cds instead of this."
3,Just so so,"I can think of some songs songs she left off that should have been added and, on the other hand, there are some songs she has on here that should not be there."
5,This really is such an amazing album..,"I love this cd so much cause it has so many great songs and there's only two songs that I don't really like and I love it when I find an album that I like, if not all, most of the songs on it cause then I'm gonna listen to it all the time and it's not a waste of money and even though there are a couple things I'd change about it (like instead of ""Stronger"", I think ""It's Your Love"" should be on there {and I was surprised that it wasn't}, instead of ""The Secret Of Life"",""I Can't Do That Anymore"" should take it's place and add ""Like We Never Loved At All"" and ""Where Are You Christmas""), but other than that, for someone who has not purchased any of her other albums, this is the one to start with (like I did with Tim McGraw)!!"
3,good - but could have been awesome,"I love Faith - but I was a little disappointed that after she expressed on a CMT interview last year that she was going to release a ""really special"" greatest hits album, she only included about half of her best songs. However, the dvd with the videos was a nice inclusion. I personally did not understand why ""Like We Never Loved At All"", ""I Can't Do That Anymore"", ""Just To Hear You Say That You Love Me"" & ""If My Heart Had Wings"" (just to mention a few) would NOT be on Faith Hill's greatest hits cd?! It is mildly perplexing..."
3,Greaest Hits? Not!!!,If this a greatest hits cd where are her hits with Tim McGraw? Wheres her soundtrach songs from THE GRINCH and other soundtracks that made her the star she is today? I'll pass.
5,CD,How can you not love Faith Hill? Love the music and very please with the purchase. Packaging was very good.
1,What??,"What a poor choice of songs! And I can't believe she only put one new song on the CD. I think Faith Hill is fantastic, but this album is very disappointing! Why didn't they put a few more new songs on the CD? I already have all of these songs on my ipod, so this CD was basically a waste of money. I also don't care for the cover. The whole CD is really disappointing."
5,Awesome CD,"I've been a Faith fan for a very long time and in no way am I the least bit disapointed. I feel ""The Hits"" was well worth the wait. The live version of ""Stronger"" is absolutely amazing. Faith totally blew me away with this song in concert and the same thing happened listening to the CD. Thank you Faith!!"
1,No surprise,"I think it should come as no surprise to anyone who appreciates country music. This woman is about marketing and making money not the music. I heard a new song by her today that is just more inane garbage that has no tonal quality, music quality, or merit on any basis in my opinion. Keep it on the rock channels and give country music fans a break! Problem is rock fans don't want to hear it either. Is there a genre for ""void of enjoyment?"""
1,Not worth the money !,"Faith Hill abandoned her Country Music fans who got her where she is. She turned her back on them, and wanted to be a Pop Diva. Her last songs have NOT been doing well at all. She is now at age 40 basically just the Opening Act for her second husband, Tim McGraw. She can not compete with the up and coming 20 year old country singers who are so talented and write all their own songs. She is not even nominated this year for any of the Award Shows. This CD is a desparate act by Faith Hill, as she knows they are calling her Faith over the Hill, and to put those failing 2 songs on a Greatest Hits cd is a rip off to listeners who did NOT go out and buy them before. The choice of songs on this CD is very disappointing and not worth the money."
3,The Hits,"It is a good thing I checked the review section first because I was really hoping to see that the song she did with Tim McGraw (""Like We Never Loved At All"") was going to be included on this. Why it wasn't behooves me.For me? That is how I was musically introduced to their stuff (sorta speak).I really had no clue who they really were other than just ""country singers"".That song is GREAT and I never get tired of hearing it yet, I get the feeling like it's being passed over and I don't understand why.To me, ""Breathe"" & ""This Kiss"" were just OK to me but honestly after a while I thought the songs got played out on the radio.""Like We Never Loved At All"" beats them hands down in my opinion.I wish they would include the clip of when they sang it together on ""Oprah"" on ""You Tube"", (eventually anyway) they kicked ass with it!I got her new perfume today tho..it rocks!Susan GBklyn, NY"
3,problem,some of the songs are not in the order listed??? Other than that it's a good cd but can't figure out what happened.
2,"Agree with other reviews, a dissapointment...","I think most of this has been covered but....1: Many missing hits....(and live versions, UGH)2:Track listing messed up (out of order which gets confusing if you want to go to a particular track and get wrong song)3: I HATE carboard packaging, it's flimsy ect and you don't want to take it in the car or whatever cause it will get messed up. I don't understand the aversion to jewel case at all as the vast majority of jewel cases will get recycled anyway after people get rid of thier collections or trade them in.Overall this release sucks..could have been sooo much better on so many fronts."
5,Fantastic,"I ordered this CD on Thursday, selected the standard shipping, and had it on Monday. Excellent customer service. The Cathedrals have always been one of my favorites, and it was a joy to find this recording on CD since i have it on records, but they were scratched up."
3,Works ok,"This does an okay job filtering our water. We have well-water, and it is really gross without a filter, but it's still not that great even with it. The filter does slow down our water pressure, but it is worth it to have clearer water."
2,Fast - yes : plug n play compatible - no,"This card is much faster than my old 6800GS. However, for the first time ever, in the many PCs I have built, I have programs that run but with NO video. I have programs that only run after I deleted all software ""updates"" that I downloaded from their site. I even had to make adjustments to MS media player, to get it to play properly. Customer service consisted of the usual ""technician"" reading from a script, who told me I needed to upgrade to MS media player v10. I can't recommend this card, unless you want a fast card that MIGHT run all of your programs, if you're lucky. PS. it does get a bit hot."
2,Card Too Long,"I have a HP Pavilion a730n (3 years old) and bought this card to replace an older ATI card. During installation into the PCI Express slot on the motherboard I discovered that the 26 pin power supply connector was in the way. I removed the connector to find out after seating the board it prevented me from plugging the power supply cable back in. The card was now useless and I had to return it.Before you buy this card make sure you measure how much room you have behind your PCI Express slot, you need at least 11"" clearance...ATI shame on you for not considering older systems before making this long long card."
2,used graphics boards,"I purchased the X1950 video board as a used item. Like anything used there is a risk. Well, my screen goes black when trying to to play steaming games, like Sniper-Ghost Warrior. On other gamesit seems to be okay, but for steaming it's not good. It had a good price so I don't feel bad about the purchase. There were risk and it crapped."
1,Rip off!!,"Bootleg of the 83 US Festival Concert on a small screen within an annoying ""letter box"" of some sort with a picture of David Lee Roth showing the whole time...very cheap and I feel that I have been ripped off!!"
2,very horrible,"I've been buying video's of the old bands trying to recapture some memories. This one by far is the worst one.The sound quality was terrible. The singing by David Lee Roth was a joke, he would sing a few words of the song and due his famous squeal. The back ground singing was so bad that I couldn't wait for the dvd to be done(my ears were bleeding).On the plus side the guitar work by Eddie was fun to watch to see the different techniques to produce the different sounds. The band also had tons of energy running around every where.But I wouldn't buy this again if given the oppurtunity again. The music quality just wasn't there. It is better to remember this band in your memory and your tapes or cd's."
5,Yes.,"I've had allergic reactions to several pads, but these work :)I love Lasinoh. I use all their products from their milk storage containers to their baby wipes. I would trust any of their products."
2,Not the best.,These are not the best nursing pads in my opinion. After having them in for only a little while they start to smell sour and I am not that heavy of a leaker. The smell transfers to my nipples and I can smell it on my baby's face after he's done nursing. They are really good at preventing leakage so I only use them when I go out in public. They are pretty thin but they do crinkle and the adhesive strip does nothing for me. When I am at home I just use washable pads. I had begun to think that I just can't use disposable pads because of the odor but I had a Gerber sample of nursing pads and since I don't leak much I was able to wear them all day. No smell when I finally changed them out.
3,Obviously obvious,"There are some good points to these nursing pads: they are absorbent, thin, and comfortable to wear. BUT, they are very large and don't conform to the breast well at all! No matter how much you try to smooth them out before you put them in your bra, you can still see the fold line very well through the bra and your shirt! Then, there's the adhesive tab...good in theory, but why do they only put 1 tab on each pad? There should be at least two to keep it in place. It's very hard to put yourself back together quickly because these pads tend to fold back onto themselves and end up looking lumpy and very odd under your clothes. I can't wait to use my box of these and get back to using Johnson & Johnson."
5,Awesome Nursing Paf,I tried many different nursing pads but Lansinoh s by far the best. It can absorb large amounts of milk and not leak. I am nursing my 3rd child and would only use these. They are decrete and very reasonabiy priced.
4,Great nursing pads at value price,"These nursing pads are thin, absorbent, comfortable, and invisible under clothing. I use them daily, and they're great -- I haven't used any other brand. I only wish they were sticky on both halves instead of just one side, but even so, they do stay in place. They come at a great value here at Amazon, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. I highly recommend them to all nursing mothers!"
4,Best on the market,I've tried other brands including Avent and these are still the best out there. They are thin and contour to your body while the others don't provide as smooth of a fit. You can still see wrinkles under tighter tees but much better than the others.
4,Excellent...but pink...,"I really, really, really wish Lansinoh would consider changing the pink to white...it is the only negative for these pads (and the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5). The Lansinoh Ultra Soft pads are white, if I remember correctly, and they are SUPER soft and comfortable. However, fewer came in each box and they were more expensive. Anyway, these pads are great (aside from the pink) -- and, if you don't normally wear white/light colored shirts, not a problem at all. If you would like to wear white/light colored shirts occasionally (like me), maybe buy a spare box of the Ultra Soft or another brand (although I've tried all other brands, and none were as good as these) to wear under those shirts."
3,They do the job,"I like these nursing pads because they do the job and are disposable and relatively comfortable. Negatives are that they kind of crinkle up in my nursing bra and don't lay flat, so I feel like it looks like I'm stuffing my bra. Also, the glue doesn't do much to hold the pad in place for long what with all the nursing throughout the day. They are decent though, and I've never had a situation where they leaked through."
5,So Much better than others!,"I nursed all four of our children and I occasionally tried other nursing pads, but none of then were as wonderful as these.The great thing about them is that they don't look bulky under you shirt even if it's a thin t-shirt. You can't even tell you're wearing them.And the other thing is I practically never leaked throught these, and I leaked alot of milk! The only times I ever leaked, is when I left them in for much too long, like if I went somewhere and forgot to pack extras in the diaper bag."
3,All wrong,The product was great. It had a nice thick color. I imagine application would be very convenient and easy. But only thing was wrong was the actual color. Turns out my car is not Orient Metallic Blue but some gray color which means i wasted much needed money.
3,CONFUSING,"The first half of this book was very interesting, but the second half was boring, confusing, so much so, that I didn't finish the book."
3,Pretty good,"This isn't the greatest cookbook in the world as it is unfortunately very lacking in comprehensive diagrams of essential mechanical procedures, forcing the reader to divine the correct series of manual actions to perform from textual descriptions of them. It is however chock full of incredibly detailed information on many aspects of Japanese culinary history and well worth every penny it goes for here on Amazon for this reason alone."
5,Christmas Homecoming a Winner,"This is our favorite Christmas cd. It is lively, humorous, intimate and serious. It gets us going in the morning during Christmas!! Well done!"
1,Not Patent,Received my item quickly but this was not at all what I expected. I purchased the same shoe in a different color so I expected the black patent to look the same but to my surprise it is not Patent at all. It is a nice shoe but I expected a patent leather - I returned the item.
1,"Careful, this is not an electric fuel pump","This review is aimed more at the Amazon description than the item itself.I purchased this item after searching for an electric fuel pump. The item description has an image that makes it appear as an electric fuel pump, the image is *not* of the actual item. This is a mechanical fuel pump and will only fit vehicles according to the specification. The quality of the fuel pump is unknown to me, although the packaging was good and the delivery prompt."
1,wrong photo,"the photo of this item is wrong!!!!here on the photo is shown electric fuel pump, but I recieved mechanical one!it is very teriable!"
4,Pretty good for such a small book...,"Wildish does an admirable job of trying to convey the history, development and basic principles of Taoism in this very slim book. He has used Eva Wong's material as his main source - this is evident by his use of ""ching"" as opposed to the more 'standard' ""jing"" found in many Taoist texts. He also uses dates found in Wong's books.The book combines a useful blend of history and philosophy to convey the general ideas behind Taoism. There are also some short sections on external and internal alchemy including some very basic information on Qigong.This is far superior to ""Simple Taoism"" and would be a good starting point for someone who is curious about Taoism. The next step would be Wong's work and perhaps Schipper's ""The Taoist Body"". Grigg's ""The Tao of Zen"" has some great historical work as well."
5,New to APS,Recently a close family member was diagnosed with APS and this book was recommended. I bought both the first and second editions and read them front to back. Many thanks to a considerate author who explained it so well! I am more comfortable now that I know more about APS and feel better prepared for the road ahead. I recommend this book and its predecessor to anyone else faced with the same. Well done!
2,Was not pleased,I have been diagnosed with APS and am an avid online researcher. After reading this book I was displeased because of the medical information mentioned in this book could be found easily on the internet. I felt I did not learn anything more that I already knew about APS after reading this.
1,What A Let Down.....,"I have been looking for information since I was dx'd w/ this disease a few years back and purchased this book in hopes of finding some new, good information. I was very let down. Most of the information that is written in this book, I have found in other books and during my many searches online. If anyone out there is looking for updated information about this disease, it might be wise, in my opinion, to look beyond this book. What a let down this book was."
3,Puzzlement,"I am anxious to use this book, but, no matter what type of pen I try to use it wipes off the shiny cardboard pages. What kind of writing utensil did other Grandmas use? Please help."
5,adorable book!,This book is a sweet way for a grandmother to share memories with her grandchild. I bought this for my mom when we had our first child and she loved it!
5,Very good book to own,"This is a great tool to have to put your prayers into motion. God's Word is active and alive and this handy book gives you the prayers to say. If you aren't good at coming up with what to say or how to pray, this book is for you. It gives you a topic to choose from, and then it gives you the prayer to say. It's great!"
4,PRAYER PREVAILS,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK TO HAVE. IT COVERS WHATEVER SITUTIONS IN LIFE YOU MIGHT HAVE. IT IS A MUST HAVE BOOK.
5,Great book so far!,"I have read the prologue, epilogue, and the first few chapters and I already know this is going to be an inspiring read! Excellent work from a first-time author!"
1,Arghhhhhhhhhh!,"The author is biased(he loves Jerry Jones), misinformed(lot of incorrect information), and just plain mean(blasting Jimmy Johnson, Houston, and Dave Campo). If this book is legitimate to you, you probably have the same traits. Probably the worst Dallas Cowboy book out there. Check out this book at the library and ask yourself, ""How did this book ever get published?"""
3,UNUSUAL DINO WESTERN ! STILL GOOD !,"This movie is not a high tension western like Rio Bravo or even Bandolero. Dean plays a chracter called Alex Flood, a bad guy. This movie provides a rare opportunity to see Dean Martin playing a bad man. And this is also a very rare opportunity to see an actor playing a bad guy can be charming. As long as your initials are D.M., it is not possible to be nasty, even when you are playing a bad guy ! So whether or not Dean Martin was the best choice for this role is arguable. Probably, the character that George Peppard played (good guy) would be much suitable for Dean Martin as people are always used to see him as a kind and happy-go-lucky persona.As for the technical details of DVD, it is in wide screen format. Picture quality is good and sound quality is not too bad."
4,5 star film 4 star disc,"would have rated higher if this first universal vault series dvd had been better,good widescreen ratio,and top notch sound,but picture is not as good as some warner archive disc`s,ok in close up,long shots have some digital glitch`s,just not as crystal clear as they should be.That said 120% better than vhs,and movie is one of the only Dean Martin flick`s he is the bad guy which make`s a nice change,starts off in fast action then gets a bit talkie,but last 40 mins action backed,worth a good evenings entertainment,but this series of films will have to do better in the picture dept for future releases."
2,Laid-Back in the Saddle Again,"Dean Martin played his only villainous role in this utterly forgettable Western drama from Universal Studios. ""Rough Night in Jericho"" (1967) boasts a solid cast, but the Marvin H. Albert-Sidney Boehm script offers few surprises. Despite his best efforts, veteran cinematographer Russell Metty cannot elevate Arnold Laven's made-for-TV directorial style. Though he looked comfortable in the saddle, most of Dino's sagebrush sagas were undistinguished by any laid-back standard."
5,Rough Night in Jericho,I had a very difficult time in finding this movie until I checked with Amazon and found out that it was available through them. Purchase price was good and service was very good and fast. Will look to Amazon more in the future for my movie needs.
2,I hoped for more,"I expected more from this when I rented it, but overall it wasn't too bad either. The name of the movie gives you most of the storyline: A rough night in Jerico. Too bad though, this movie had potential"
4,Rollicking Western,A routine but enjoyable western yarn that was pretty violent for its time (the fight between George Peppard and Slim Pickens in particular).Dean Martin goes against type as a villain out to destroy Jean Peter's stage line. It's up to hero George Peppard and crusty old John McIntyre to set things aright - which they do amid much gunfire and fisticuffs.
5,A great movie that should be more appreciated,"This movie is a winner for me. I like every one of the actors. I didn't like to see Dean Martin as the bad guy but when he played a bad man, he was a BAD man. He was good in the role, pure charming evil. I also enjoyed Slim Pickens as the underling bad man. He was rough, nasty evil as opposed to Flood's smooth, subtle brand. I will watch a movie just because George Peppard is in it. It's why I watched this one the first time. Dolan was pure charming, subtle, tough as nails good. The plot has no surprses but sometimes, if the plot is decent, it doesn't need any. It just flows and is comfortable. You don't have to see the part after the big fight to know Dolan winds up going home and marrying Molly, running the stage line and not winding up owing 51% of everything. It is a satisfying movie and a real keeper. I would recommend it to any Western fan."
3,Only How-To's and nothing about why something is done,"This book was ok in some respects but the author went into the ""NorthWind Trader"" pieces too much and didnt explain how to get from point A-G only from point D-G which really frustrated me. Also the author rarely explains WHY you would ever use a feature or anything he talks about and just explains how to. Which is useless for someone like me who needs to have a WHY WHEN and HOW to understand the processes that are explained."
3,"Contemporary looks, but not much else really useful here","I had already reviewed a dozen or more books from the local library on bathroom designs, so I went into this one hopeful that it would have something fresh to offer.The good news is, it doesn't have the dated looks of many of the older books that I reviewed from the library (primary-colored wallpaper, anyone?) and it does adhere to a mostly consistent minimalist, spa-like aesthetic.The bad news is, though, there's nothing really adaptable about most of it -- minimalism by its nature means there isn't a whole lot there beyond the walls and the foundational pieces, and if the looks of this book's examples are to be believed, it appears to be necessary to buy very expensive high-end pieces (sinks, countertops, tubs, etc) to create the most tranquil spaces for bathing.While sky's-the-limit spending would clearly make the job easier, I'm holding out for a book that shows me how to achieve that transcendent feeling on a more down-to-earth budget."
4,"Bathrooms as work of art, peace and relaxation","This is a book of inspiration and art of some truly unique bathrooms. The author has carefully selected and photographed bathrooms that promote bathrooms as a place to relax and free the mind of the worries of the upcoming day. There are photographs of bathrooms from across the world that include Lebanon, Japan, Finland and the USA.This is not a book about how to decorate or remodel your bathroom easily. For most of us, we already have bathrooms carved out in our houses, and we can only borrow some simple ideas from the book, such as placing plants to reverse the 'chi' from downward flowing water; mirrors to create space; and keeping the bathroom simple and uncluttered.This is clearly one of my favorite home design books and makes a great coffee table book. The reader is not overwhelmed with text, only the pictures which convey the author's message across."
2,Useless,"I wish I could join in with the others in their accolades of this book, but to me it was completely useless. Perhaps it's just that the style of the bathrooms (mostly modern and minimalist) doesn't appeal to me. I didn't find one that looked like any bathroom I'd ever seen. In fact, most had a distinctive European look.Pretty pictures, few words, and overall not one new idea did I cull from this book. Most definitely not worth my money."
3,What we expected,"This is a fairly cheap product-the 50 watt Halogen recommended is really unsafe to use for any length of time.We replaced the 50 watt halogen with an 11 watt GU10 LED with a base adapter which worked much better. It generates no heat at all, but the 50 watt halogen was so hot you could not touch the lighting fixture after 5 minutes.Dangerous. With the LED, you get the same amount of light, no heat, not dangerous and you can literally turn it on and leave it on safely for 25 to 35,000 hours.The lightinng fixture itself would be even better if it was made with internal framings similar to a real Leko.This would allow for even better control of the light beam.Terrific that it comes with Gel Frames."
4,A Fantastic Reference for Weekend Repair & Maintenence,"I bought this book after buying my first camaro. It has been a great reference in two ways. First it groups repair and maintenence chores by area of the vehicle. For example Interiors: listings; weatherstriping, dash, package deck, handle replacement etc. Secondly, it has very detailed step by step photos showing you what you get into during the repairs. Too often we launch into a project only to find ourselves surrounded with various parts and no end in site. This feature gave me a good idea of those repairs I was willing to do my self and the ones I would sub out to professionals. At the begining of each section there is a narrative describing what they hope to achieve. Included in these are the helpful hints and warnings that you will need to save time and money during your repairs. For the do it your selfer this is a manual worth having."
4,slipping,"Yamaha, like Sony, is going cheap. Still good, but I would take Onkyo who is stil making a full name before they compromise for the money."
5,My favorite CD,of all times. Every time I play it when I have guests they always ask me what it is. I haven't met a person yet who didn't love this CD.
5,good speaker for price,"good speaker for price, they are powered by the radio deck.good clean bass, mids and tweet."
2,Use it and beware of these three things:,"Beware of these three things before you use this book: One, this book is only helpful if you know the material, if you are thinking by practicing in these exams will teach you everything about Global History, you have another thing coming, two, some of these books are out of date since the new regents for Global history came out and you should wait until the new books come out, three, if you want to review for the Global Regents and get to the 90's mark, Study in your textbook, get a good review book which has all the material from Rome to Hiter, and don't be afraid to ask your teacher for help. Remember this is a Regent and it will not kill you, Good luck to all of you!"
4,A Good Review Book,"As a Global History teacher I found this book to be very good. It has good practice questions, essays, and a good list of vocabulary and famous people and places. But most importantly it explains the correct answers and why the other choices are wrong. This is a good review book."
4,excellent,"this cd has some of the nicest beats ive heard in awhile. you will enjoy. i heard the song ""dreamer"" at 18th street lounge in washington dc, i knew i had to have the cd. i am not disappointed."
4,rocks the box!,"carr does a first-rate job of analyzing these small illinois cities. . . which are really the epicenters of the surrounding area. This book reminded me a lot of Daniel Elazar's Cities of the Prairie books, demonstrating the continuing force of local political culture through time. I've lived in Galesburg and I live near Ottawa, and know something of the history of these cities, and she really does a handsome job of putting it all together."
4,Creepy noir.,"What a great and very creepy melodrama! I had thought that Brahm was mainly a movie director but he seems to have gone into TV in the 50s and never looked back. Ralph Bellamy (I can't watch him without thinking of his role as Dr Saperstein in Rosemary's Baby) is just great, as is Anne Baxter, of course. This is also on the 50-movieDark Crimes Collection 50 Movie PackI got for about $15. The quality on that disc is terrible but watchable, so I'd be disappointed if the quality of this individual release wasn't better. If it is, it'll be well worth it. (Two other directors are credited. I just wonder who was responsible for some of the more unusual wide-angle and above-head shots at the end. In any case, the lighting is just great.)"
2,"We good, Baxter bad","The big problem with this film is the big problem with people - most see only in terms of black and white. Baxter is presented as evil personified and all the other characters as pure, innocent beings who fall victim to her coniving, when in fact, they are all more than ready to believe the worst about Bellamy and McDonald, who, in fact, are not innocent - come on, a live-in model with the body of McDonald and our Vargas-like ""artist"" beyond suspicion behind closed doors? The psychology here would have made for a movie with some depth (which it likely had in the original play), but Hollywood dumbed it down for the simple minded evil vrs bad audience."
1,"""Love Anne Baxter"" But........","Anne Baxter has always been one of my favorite actresses, but I'm so disappointed in the plot of this story. One of my favorite's of hers' is ""One Desire"" with Rock Hudson and Natalie Wood. I haven't been able to locate a VHS or DVD of that movie. That one is really a good story! Great actors in the whole movie! Thanks for asking for my opinion....Judy"
3,3rd in THE BIG BAD WOLFE Series,"Sergeant Royce Wolfe rescues Megan Delaney from her fears and trauma of a near rape and brutilizing.He lays [grin] all six foot four inches of himself at her disposal and etc., as he tracks down the perp.This is the third Wolfe to bit the dust -- story is light but interesting up to a point.A little disappointing after reading One Tough Hombre -- but --great characters, both men and women but story is just so much fluff."
5,Introducing Robin McKelle,"If you like jazz ""torch"" singers with a lot of feeling go for this one. But if you don't like current swing `40's big band and ballad type swing that is upbeat and uptone, pass. If, on the other hand, you like big brass jazz and have a soft spot for swing with a singer that exudes high passion and emotion (- the hair standing up kind -) this is the one for you. That's how she makes me feel and music is all about feeling.On this album she's been aligned with Ella or Sarah, and she does have that feeling, but she has her own style if you listen.If you want more on a quieter side but with raised passion in her voice and scat, look around for her first album ""Never Let Me Go"" from 1999. It's hot. Small group and huge sound, but 7 years between albums, ouch.So Enjoy.LeeClearwater, FL"
3,Great 40's voice,She sounds great singing songs of this era but the sound mix guy messed up and let the instruments overpower the vocals.
2,Kinda annoying,"I love 40's bigband - I love her voice. However, it was overwhelming at points and the band and the voice were stepping all over eachother - it became annoying. There is so much BRASS and BRAWN between the two, I found it took too much energy to listen to.I gave it to my lawyer to have. He seems to like annoying."
4,Four Horsemen,A very good look at one of the biggest names in Wrestling history: The Four Horsemen. Good ring footage and good behind the scenes interviews.
5,Been waiting a long time,I've been waiting a long time to see a dvd about the Horsemen since I've only watched them during the time that Sullivan was the booker and he kinda hated Benoit and Pillman. I do hope that they include some of the viewpoints from the members of the Horsemen that are still alive I mean the WWe has a chance to really make this a great dvd and I hope they include some of Benoit's matches with Sullivan on this dvd. I mean sure the matches might not have been tag team matches but they was done during the time that he was a member of the Horsemen also I hope they include the tag team match between Ric Flair and Arn Anderson going against the Late Brian Pillman and Steve Austin which in my opinion was one of the greatest tag team matches of all time. I'm also hoping they include some of Flair's matches with Sting and some of Arn's matches on this dvd as well as Ole's matches since there really isn't a place to watch those anymore unless you get WWe 24-7.
3,The cover?,"I'm already skepical of this dvd. The cover features Barry Windham (instead of Ole Anderson) who was not an original member of the Four Horseman. If the dvd concentrates on the original Horsemen, then it should be pretty good."
4,disappointing match selection,"I really enjoy this dvd and have always been a huge horsemen fan.The documentary section is very well done and covers differing sides of the group from the perspective of members and contemporaries alike.Several excerpts from HHH,Jerry Lawler,Steve Austin,Shaun Michaels,Teddy Long and Jim Ross permeate the disc.Dusty Rhoades and Paul Ellering also contribute their insight into the horsemen phenomenon.I was disappointed in some of the match selections.I know some can be found on other disc but I would of liked to have seen some of Tully's matches with magnum T.A. or Flair against Luger.Even some of flairs matches against the road warriors in singles competition,Arn and Flair vs. Doom,Sid vicious vs. Sting and finally some matches against the new world order.The disc is a testament to way a wrestler worked the mic and the ring,which is a lost art form today.I highly recommend this disc to any wrestling fan."
3,Oh Dusty - Will you ever learn?,"So Dusty Rhodes is sitting in a bar with John Belushi and in walks the Four Horseman. Only, John Belushi died in March of 1982 and the Horseman didn't emerge until, what, '85? That's one hell of a bar. I wonder if my dead cat is having a drink there right now.And can we please get a 3 disc DVD where Ric Flair just talks about his divorce? That would go straight to #1 on Amazon's chart!BTW, Arn Anderson comes across like a mental patient."
3,Mixed reaction...,"I loved the documentary, having grown up in the NWA/WCW Horsemen era (all incarnations). My favorite ""stable"" was the original: Ole, Arn, Tully, and Ric. Seeing more of Ole on the mic would have been nice, but the full story of the Horsemen is told well. The choice of matches on Disc 2, however, is horrible.It's also sad to be reminded of how the suits at WCW never really understood the fan appeal of the Horsemen. It's inexplicable. If you didn't already know about him, watch the documentary and see Eric Bischoff at his megalomaniacal, dissembling best."
1,Memory lane,"Lived in Virginia Beach, VA when the NWA ruled wrestling! Observed the genesis of the 4 horsemen and this brought back many, many memories!!! Fast and fantastic delivery! Sooner than expected! Plan on ordering more!!"
2,DVD only came with first wind in willows not winter,"I'm very upset I wasted 60$ and only got half of what I was asking for, I'd really like my money back."
3,Wind in the Willows,"This is the third version of Wind in the Willows that I've seen with my daughter. This may be the lamest version we've watched. Still, its a great story. Very funny and with the second movie, Winter in the Willows, make it a good buy. I don't regret buying it."
4,Great light Kit,"Well made and flexible enough for most indoor shooting situations. The case is sturdy enough for transporting the kit anywhere yourself, but NOT meant to ship as luggage / cargo. I have been using the kit for almost a year and would buy it again."
5,"ClosetMaid 36x 12 "" shelf",I live in a small apt with a laundry closet with just enough room for a washer & dryer and very few shelves. My son put these up for me and said they were very easy to do and they look great! I'm very happy with them and they're very sturdy! Thanks ClosetMaid!
2,"Lights, yes, fan, no.",If you are looking for a fan than look elsewhere. This cant be felt for more than a few inches. If you are looking for a little something for a childs room to add some decoration this might be your thing. The lightshow is pretty cool.
1,This fan is very misleading,I bought these for several desks in our office becuase they were cool. Blow air yeah right 1 inch from the fan. They are also loud and noisy.
1,Nice looking but poorly made.,"This fan is much smaller than you may think. It also has these crazy little lights that are on the blades. I received the fan it and was broken and was shorting out. I recommend avoiding it because it will cost more in shipping to than what its worth. (eg. recieving/send back)Its also made in china, you get what you pay for."
2,Horrible,I was really disappointed. The fan is a junk. There is no air or anything comes out of it. It is not a toy or a Fan. I was fooled by the picture. Please do not buy. Better of buying bigger fan.I would rate it Zero. But It was my fault for ordering it.
1,Horrible,"It was the most horrible, irritating fan I have ever seen. I wanted to return it but I did not have the box anymore.I really was unhappy with it."
2,Not the Diamonds,I had hoped that this DVD was of The Diamonds. It is not. That fact speaks for itself.
4,Politically Incorrect and Funny,"If you or anyone you know has ""Big Boobs"" this book is a funny look at the downside of being well endowed. A collection of witty one-liners and cartoons that will make you jealous of you flat-chested friends."
4,"If you like his fairies, you'll love this.","I love all of Brian Froud's drawings. I think I have every single one of his books. If you can't find ""The Goblins of Labyrinth,"" try looking for ""The Goblin Companion."" Enjoy!"
4,Accurate - helpful,"If nothing else, this guide serves to provide an alternative to the Princeton Review. While no single book can explain all there is to know about a single school or admissions process, this guide does an admirable job describing the highs and lows of each school, its personality and some of the processes one would have to go though to get into such a school. Overall one of if not the single best guides out there."
4,Great product.,I got an XL size for my 48 lbs dog. The strap that goes around his belly is way too big (I will just staple it or stitch it to make it smaller. I really like the product it looks great on my dog.Advice: go with a larger size to ensure that the dog will be covered completely.
2,Average Cheap Best of Complimation,First off let me say that Jefferson Airplane is a great band but this CD isn't so great. First off it starts off with the mono version of Somebody To Love I think and than goes into White Rabbit. Than the other songs on the album havent really heard too much... But its another chintsy greatest hits CD but for 7 bucks its a good deal and i suggest you buy it if you want a cd by jefferson airplane but just want there two best songs but even than go with the worst of jefferson airplane.2.5/5 stars
5,Great Book on Antarctica!,"This is a really wonderful book about Antarctica. I have yet to find such a thorough book on the subject that was also easy to read. I learned things I haven't heard before and the book clarified points for me that I had questions about. I love the True Books, they are a great series."
3,Pretty good,"This is a great tape for those days when I just don't feel like doing my usual running/biking routine. It doesn't get boring since it's composed of three parts. However, it's not terribly challenging, so it makes a good tape for beginners or for those who are just tired/sick."
4,only time will tell,"I had these for 4 years or more. I wear them a few times a week and I prefer these than some other more expensive ones I owned. Very well made and comfortable. As a matter of fact, I am buying a replacement pair now since mine is finally showing some wear and tear.Updated 1-30-2011Found it on sale at a different site, and bought 2 pairs. I was kind of disappointed when it arrived. It still looks the same but it was made from different materials than the one I bought years ago."
5,Best sandals ever,"I was hesitant to buy them because of the price, i'm cheap, 5 years later of constant abuse (weigh over 250lbs) in the summer time (on the boat/dock/campground/fishing/walking around town)and as house slippers in the winter the thong finally broke. Very comfortable, I will be buying another pair for sure!"
5,nice sandals,"These are the most comfortable thong sandals I have ever worn. It took some time to get used to the strap between my toes, but there was no chafing or blisters. I'm wearing them at work right now!"
1,NOW That's What I Call Indie,"This is one of those things that's trying to put a label on something that can't be labeled. These days, mainstream music is probably the worst it's ever been with crap like Nickelback and Fall Out Boy at the top of the charts. So now the mainstream has to try to co-opt the independent music scene (something that has been around forever and spans a huge spectrum of genres) and water it down and label it as a genre itself.So don't be a tool and get this CD. If you want to find out about new and interesting bands just check out Pitchfork or other music sites and listen to the songs they put up or go to Lastfm and listen to tracks from bands that seem interesting to you.Also, the MTV2 logo is on the cover of this CD and I think we all know what that means. It doesn't matter if it's MTV2 or MTV9, MTV has always been the music industry equivalent of AIDS."
1,Indie's Biggest Hits Volume 1??,"A greedy corporation's attempt to cash in on Indie Rock Music. This gets one star for the fact that they would even market this similar to ""NOW that's what I call music. This music deserves a better outlet."
2,Python Injection 843-926 Airflow / Mass Air Sensor Fits VOLVO,I returned this product. The product was not presented well. It was filthy on the inside and just did not look like a part that I wanted to install on my car.
5,"Terrific, fast paced action story","This is a taut, thrilling story, full of action and adventure. It propels the reader along at an ever-intensifying pace to an all-out, satisfying resolution. Well plotted and keenly envisioned. I heartily recommend it for all fans of Dragonlance."
3,"New battlegrounds, same personal dilemmas and institutional power plays","I first read this book after it came out in the 1990s and recall being somewhat disappointed by it. Second time round, i enjoyed it more but still would not rate it among my all time le Carre favorites. Sadly events of the past decade have made the enduring conflict between the Russian state and ethnic minorities in former Soviet possessions more familiar to all of us and this may have helped make the story of Ingushestian dispossession and suffering more accessible. Our Game has many of le Carre's familiar themes including the insecurities and complex personal loyalties of upper class Englishmen, the duplicity and alienation of the secret world of spies and betrayal at all levels. Paranoia and deceit are the driving forces and the reader is soon drawn in to a strong narrative supplied by the master spy writer's superb writing and powerful imagination. Well worth the return visit."
2,Too slow for spy novel,"I find Le Carr's more recent post-soviet works slow read. ""Our game"" is a case in point. It took some effort to move through the book. If you want to pick up a Le Carr book, I recommend his earlier ones such as ""the smiley's people"" or ""the little drummer girl."""
4,Brilliant,"Excellent, both in how it reads and in its overall story; simultaneously a fine place to begin with LeCarre and a great vantage point to look back on the Cold War."
2,"Finally it's over, thank god!","I almost skip every other line in the final 50 or so pages. And in the end, I really don't know what has happened. I give credit for the author to fully develop two characters. Emma remains the same woman who comes from the dark with no background, no family and past history from beginning to end.What is the book really about? I don't know. Maybe it's about quaint friendships between Tim and Larry or maybe it's about self-iscovery but the author never explain that clearly. Anyway, all that have little to do with spying and espionage.It is a book I regret having the privilage to read ."
5,LOVED IT,"I purchased this book in hard-back off a discount rack. I had never heard of le Carre, although I had seen the motion pictures, ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,"" and ""The Russia House."" I couldn't put it down.So far, it may be my favorite, although I am torn between it and ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,"" and I am now a big fan of George Smiley, since I am working my way through his novels in chronological order.Read it. READ ALL OF HIS BOOKS, except maybe ""The Naive and Sentimental Lover."""
3,He has done much better...,"I must have been out of sorts when I read this because I usually adore a Le Carre read and this time, I didn't. I just didn't give a darn about the main character, who was so completely unsympathetic that I kept wishing that something really dire would happen to him so we could get to someone more interesting. And I really didn't like the whining about the lost girlfriend who left with the braver, more charismatic friend. I just didn't care... For Le Carre at his recent best, better try ""The Constant Gardener""."
3,Our Games' Emma grabs our attention,"The plot device of Tim Cranmers' unrequited love for Emma was what kept me reading Our Game. The spy plot was old hat, but the love story was actually quite poignant. Any man out there that has loved a woman who does not love him back, feels an ache that is like no other."
3,Not as good as earlier version,"I was replacing an A2000 I've had for four years. Hoped this would be the same...it wasn't. Stiffer, dark orange color. I didn't like it and returned it. Oh, also it did not have that great ""new leather smell""."
2,It's too immature...,"People always says that this album was fine and got good music. But, i think it's not..Hikki's voice is too low than high... I think she needs more of ''teen voice'' than a fathery or boysih voice.. the reason why i give only 2 stars 'cause i've finished hearing it and never heard it again...:P"
4,Hikki...,"""Wait & See ~Risuku~"" is a great single, and makes for a great CD. Even though I didn't really like ""Fly me to the Moon,"" the disk on the whole was uplifting and good for evenings when you just need to wind down. It also helps that I have a major crush on Utada Hikaru to make this review so positive. :D"
4,Sony A57 Instructional DVD by QuickPro review,"Good DvD for for beginners like me, covers all the major functions and includes tips and tricks in a simple and easy to understand language."
4,A good overview of beginning Spanish,"I purchased the book to help me learn Spanish and found the book to be a useful overview of beginning Spanish. The limitation is that book provides an overview, but only a little practice with each concept before moving onto new vocabulary. There is not enough practice for mastery of the topics covered by the product. In using the book, I thought it would be even better if it had an audio component. When I looked to see that it did have one, I bought that as well. The CDs are a companion to the book and are an essential component of learning the language. As with the book, I would have liked more opportunity to practice each component (verbs, different types of vocabulary, etc.) before moving onto new things. The model for how to do practice well is the Pimsleur series, which I highly recommend. The cost of Spanish in 10 Minutes a Day is very reasonable, so it's a worthwhile product to buy."
4,Jessica Henderson review,I was satisfied with the product and the service. The delivery was great with no problems
3,Spanish in 10 minutes a day,I would love this-but it won't work with my computor-it is for a Mac and I didn't see that when I ordered it. The audio cds are awesome and so is the workbook-but unable to use the rest.
4,Good Beginning Spanish Audio CD,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He has no spanish experience but speaks english and farsi. I studied spanish in high school and college but never learned how to speak the language very well. These audio CDs have been helpful for both of us. It comes with a book that applies to the lessons on the CD. My husband has caught on really quick using this system. It also has been a great refresher for me. This system will teach you just the basics, but is a greater introduction to spanish."
2,"Gardening secrets? Yeah, right.","This book contains very little in the form of gardening secrets. It does tell you all about various plants, what their characteristics are, and gives guidelines with regards to zoning and such, but I've yet to find an answer to a gardening question or dilemma when consulting this book. For example, here's an excerpt from a supposed ""troubleshooting"" table for vegetable problems: ""Peppers -- problem: sunscald of fruit. cause: inadequate shading of fruit by leaves, often noticed after defoliation of plant during hot, dry weather."" Great, so where's the troubleshooting? What should I do to prevent this? What's the practical solution? Where's the 'secret'?Overall, very unimpressed with this informational book. It's fine if you want to learn about various plants, but not very practical for the gardener trying to yield a successful harvest."
1,"Spend more, you're worth it","This item looks and feels very cheap - perhaps because it is. It is lightweight because it's hollow, which I didn't expect, and there are visible seams along the sides of the charm where the two halves were joined together, and a hole in the bottom where they weren't joined all the way. The loop where the hook is attached to the charm seems flimsy."
5,The best,"This is a beautiful light source. I hear a lot about how even it is, who cares? Really? Even? What difference would a little variation make, seriously.What is great about this box is the fantastic smooth quality of the light, the easy fast setup, and the great durability and design. I have used it on hundreds of shoots most on location and it looks great, travels well, and holds up well to repeated setup, tear-down and travel. This is my favorite piece of lighting gear, period.Throws a beautiful round catchlight.I also have profoto large umbrellas and while they are interesting, this is just a much better design.It seems like a lot of money, but this box works great on everything and is totally worth the price. TOTALLY WORTH IT!"
4,The movie is o.k.,"The pony is great,very pretty, nice color. The only thing is if you have a very energetic child you have to remind them not to break the stick inside the wings. Now as for the video it is a good story, but the sound is very washed out. It reminds me of recording a show off of t.v. and watching it over and over until the sound and the colors get washed out. In my video the picture jumps a little in one spot. I think Hasbro could have done a better job with the quality of the movie for the money they make."
4,Cute and sweet but fuzzy video!!,"Yes, i agree, the video is very fuzzy but it is fun and cute to watch. The pony is lovely and fun if you use your imagionation. Cute set. great price. i got this toy for my b-day...... cute eyes and the designs are great and pretty! love it!!!!!!"
3,Xerox copies,"If you're just looking for ""The Coasters"" sound, this can be it. If you're looking for the genuine original Coasters performing their hits, keep looking. This is 1988 concert from the Rock 'n' Roll Palace, which may explain why there is no picture of the cover in the ad."
1,Should not be sold on the US web site,"I called Amazon to make sure this would play on my up to date computer, knowing it would not necessarily play on our DVD player. I was told that computers are different and would play all DVDs. Well, the DVD did not play on my computer and for the same reason it would not have played on my DVD player; because it was created for Region 2 players (Australia). Amazon should know this and not sell this product in the US. Furthermore, the DVD manufacturer should standardize their products so as not to cause such problems. Does anyone know where I can buy a Seven Little Monsters DVD for US viewing?"
1,Buyer Beware -- This is NOT Energy Glow! Irritating to skin!!!,"I bought this thinking it was Energy Glow, which I loveand is very soothing to sensitive skin. What I got wasGo Fresh, which is horrible! It has little ""beads"" thatscratch your skin. The grapefruit extract in it is acidicand drying to the skin. I hope people who loved EnergyGlow will write to Dove and complain that the producthas been discontinued in favor of this horrible alternative.If you have sensitive skin, forget Go Fresh!!!"
3,subtly infectious,"Jazzy-World-Electronica-Percussion, that ought to sum up the type of music on this album. The tracks are long and steady, lots of simple chanting loops and persistent percussion. The overall feel is mellow: you probably won't be playing this at a dance party. And it's not for everyone, but for what it is, it's good. It's not exciting if you listen to it and focus on every note, but if you put it on and go about your business you will soon find yourself infected by it. If you're the type that feels your life should have a soundtrack, then give it a try."
2,"oh man, don't buy this","The title is soooooo wrong. The video does not even address these questions. It should be, ""Five shallow minutes about various religions."" It is essentially a series of short, superficial interviews with people in various religious traditions. Although a few of the people interviewed were interesting and deserved better coverage, Thomas More's commentary was worthless. So much was just inappropriate; for instance, at one point he softly plays a piano for several minutes. Perhaps he is a wise man, but he does not communicate any of that wisdom here. No thoughtful person will benefit from this video. It often uses footage from the Mystic's Journey documentaries, which appear to be much more worthwhile."
3,A Learning Experience,"I was after a copy of Thayer's, but didn't know there were different versions. That's OK. At the low price I paid, I can make it work. Study is good."
1,Maybe...,I think I'll take this down to the playground tomorrow and do some light reading. Hoping for sunshine and not showers.
1,Please pull thisone from the shelves!!,"Well, this little book will be pulled from the shelves soon. No one will ever know the extent of the damage this man did or the number of children he touched. I am disgusted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Hey Jerry,"You are a vile piece of amphibian dung. Rot in hell. I did not read this, nor would I even scan such a disengenuous set of pages. You disgust me and anyone else who has a shred of decency."
1,Touched? Sandusky sure is,"Critically acclaimed by Michael Jackson and crowned the manifesto for NAMBLA, Jerry Sandusky's portrayal as a man in search of love in...sports is cliche at best.While the tone of the book may feel like Mr. Rogers, the underlying emotion is clearly John Wayne Gacy."
1,"Sequel will be ""Tight Ends""","There is a lot of interesting material in this book. While Jerry coached the linebackers and defense, he let the players know that he was always behind them. He also helped the players who didn't have much money; if they didn't have transportation, he always offered that if they'd bend over, he would be happy to drive them home. Little known was his work with the wide the tight ends, especially teaching them the ""fly"" pattern As he wrote in the book, ""it's okay to drop the soap in the shower room, but not the pigskin on the playing field.""One of Penn State's most enthusiastic recruiters of young talent, Jerry's playing field will soon be more confined at his new school, ""State Penn."" New uniform will be a blue and white evening gound, where he will try to find a way to solve the prison team's awesome ""Back Door Blitz.""Good luck, Jerry. Nobody deserves what the future will hold any more than you do."
1,Irony,"The Fates are having a good laugh watching this unfold. I have been a Penn State faithful for over 25yrs. Since this case broke I have thrown out my No Ordinary Joe book, thrown away my PSU hooded sweater and cap. What has happened killed any desire to look at anything PSU related."
1,I hope he is mistreated in prison,"This guy will have an awesome time in the joint, reading his book to the other inmates while they decimate his backside."
1,He has been convicted now!,Alas his supporters that he is innocent until proven guilty.Well he is Guilty on 45 countsRepeat 45 counts. Amazon needs to remove this book and people need to stop hero worship.
1,ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww,Could they have picked a more inappropriate title? That guy is disgusting and should rot in hell after rotting in jail as someone's biyatch.
1,"Amazon, do the right thing.","If the decision makers at Amazon have any morals, they'll make this book unavailable. If Sandusky is somehow cleared of this awful and disgusting mess, then by all means, sell away, but until then it's an insult to every victim of his despicable acts."
2,a great co-book for this.,perhaps a great book to bundle with this is [...] I think the two can help those who are pedo's and those attacked by pedo's.
1,Amazon should be ashamed for carrying this book!,"APPALLING, EVIL INCARNATE! Take this book off the site! This disgusting EVIL pedophile should not be benefiting from what he did. AS THE MOTHER OF 2 BOYS, I THINK THIS BOOK IS AN ENDORSEMENT OF A VERY EVIL MAN. PLEASE REMOVE!"
3,"Touched, sort of...","Jerry Sandusky's memoir reveals the way in which he touched young boys while in a position of authority and influence at State College. While I have no direct knowledge of these touchings, I give Jerry the benefit of the doubt. After all, if they were only touches, what's the real harm? Penn State football rules!"
1,TELL-ALL Biography,"Jerry ""Touched"" Sandosky has left quite a stain. JoPa, you knew about this in 2002!! You deserve to be fired."
5,A great uplifting read!!!,"This was such a great book I have recommended to all my friends. The book is worth it the sexual inuendo alone, and is extremely titilating. With his talk about ""tight ends"", ""getting down under center"", and ""going deep down the middle of the field"", Jerry Sandusky breaks fertile ground into gay erotica. The story is about a young boys search for meaning in life, and how Jerry introduces him violently to the world of the gay lifestyle. Breaking the young boy is tough work though, and this book details the trials and errors along the way. I give this book 5 stars."
1,AMAZON MUST REMOVE THIS BOOK FROM ITS SHELVES!,"Why on earth is Amazon sitting on its hands and allowing this atrocity of an ""ironic"" title still sit on its shelf, allowing an alleged pedophile to continue to make money from his diseased proclivity for ""liking"" young boys. Amazon, c'mon and step up and do the right thing! This is NOT free speech anymore~!"
1,Oh Jerry,Looking forward to reading about your upcoming brutal murder in prison or cowardly suicide. You know that's the only 2 ways this story ends. Take care!!
1,Disgusting,"Amazon please remove this book from your website. This trash should not have the opportunity to be sold in which the money will go towards that pedafile's defense. He's a criminal that needs to be 'touched,' in prison!"
1,This is abhorant,"Remove the book permanently. When Sandusky was arrested, they should have done to him like happened to that dude in The Shawshank Redemption. ""Two things never happened again after that day. A child was never raped at Penn State again, and Jerry Sandusky never walked again."""
