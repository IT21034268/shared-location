4,Surprise,"Okay after reading the eclipse trilogy i didnt really think i would like anything else to do with vampires. lol. I saw the cover and i thought this would be soemthing like a bad Paris Hilton Vampire story but it turned otu to be more interesting than that. now i cant wait to read the second one. I was pleasantly surprised, the different take on a mythical creature was refreshing. no where near twilight perhaps but nice in a different way. Twilight i found (although i love it) it to be a little obsessive and Bella pissed me off enuff throughout the series but im still hooked. lol. but anyway this is a very good one and i hope this continues."
3,Good Summer Read,"I started this book and had it finished within one day. The book is a good read, but a little slow starting. There are a lot of characters introduced and getting to know them and keep them straight was daunting at first. Especially with the writing style De La Cruz chose.I would have liked the book to be longer and a bit more detailed on the vampire tradition and not the fashions. When I read about vampires I want to be enlightened about thier history and culture. Also, I was making some connections about the number and the idea of the fallen angels, but the story never clarified my perceptions about the vampires.I reached the last chapter and was still thoroughly confused about what was going on. I may have to read it through again to see if I missed anything. Cruz's ideas were unique and interesting, but she needed to take a little bit more time to develope those ideas instead of turning to fashion. Hopefully the next book will explain a bit more."
3,Blue Bloods,"Alright, I'm not going to say this book was badly written and I'm not downgrading it in any way whatsoever. This is my personal opinion, but I thought the book was kind of boring. It didn't catch my interest the way it could have. And I know that if it takes me longer than a week to read a book, then it is not a good enough book to me.It was still good, but not as good as I was hoping. I will still read the sequel, however, because I honestly do want to find out what happens. I just don't think this is going on my list of favorite books anytime soon."
5,blue bloods,I was very impressed on how fast I recieved the product and the book itself is really good
1,Best part was the Synopsis,"I read the plot of the book and thought it sounded entertaining. The writing is horrid, there's no flow, the story never actually progresses.... It is the worst ""writing"" I have ever read. The only reason I finished reading it was because it was so short and I bought the book. Don't waste your time, this wont entertain you in the least."
2,It's no Twilight,"Being a huge fan of the Twilight series, I wasn't sure I would like this book. It's an okay read. The only redeeming quality is the presence of Schuyler. If it wasn't for her character I wouldn't have been able to stand all the high society snootiness and the superficial teens who consume mass quantities of designer clothing. It was an interesting read, overall. I didn't feel like it was a complete waste of time."
2,not that impressed,"I picked this book up after reading Twilight and New Moon (trying to pass the time until Eclipse), but I was really dissappointed. Some of the content was too adult (getting naked at parties, drinking, and smoking)..they're only 15!!! If I had kids, I don't think I would want to read it. She also did waaay too much name dropping- I thought maybe she was being endorsed for all of the brand names she used (ya know, kind of like when the movies sneak products into the shot). I figure, with trends changing as fast as they do, this book will be obsolete in a couple of years. It was shallow, with too much detail on what they were wearing and not enough detail on the personalities of the characters and the plot (which seems like it could have been interesting)."
3,Took too long to get good,"I'm in my 20's and ever since reading the Twilight series, I have become obsessed with trying to find something else just as good. (Very Hard)'Blue Blood' took a longggg time to get good. Not until you are about half-way through the book, does it start to get interesting. The diary entries were a little confusing for me. There's alot of ""name-throwing"" (prada, paige, versace, etc.) Lots of just non-stop talking about popular/good-looking people and how they dress, where they party, etc. So at first I was really regretting buying the book.But when I had about 100 pages left, it started getting pretty good; where now, I need to buy 'Masquerade'.Not too bad just takes time to get good."
2,I for got to add to my original review,Did anyone else notcie how much this story resembled the City of Bones.I read this book second and can tell you I will be in no hurry to read the other one in the series. The City of Bones books are so much better! No fashion lessons and more morals. No under age sex.
2,Pretty disapointed with this book :(,I didn't like at all the fact that these are supposed to be 15 to 16 year old kids who are drinking and having casual sex. This was very disappointing. I thought this was supposed to be a young adult book. The character should have been older for the content. This had the potential for being a good story. But I also felt like I was reading a fashion magazine most of the time. I mean she even tells you what name brand underwear the characters wear. Who needs to know that! Stick to the story! without all that none sense and age issues for me I think I could have liked the story. It was just so so for me as is. Nothing I would read again. This also wouldn't be the first book I would recommend to friends.
2,Ok,"It was an ok book, more for young crowd. I would have liked it to be longer. But overall it was alright."
3,"Took awhile to really get into it, and then it was over...",It took me a long while to get used to her style of writing but after that it was just kind of hard to get into.... I liked it but it wasn't the best....
3,it was okay. got better towards the end.,I love vampire books but this was not the best. It wasnt terrible but it wasnt a page turner. easy to put down.
5,A Highly Original Twist On The Vampire Genre,"This is the first in Melissa de la Cruz's series that portrays life in New York's high society with a paranormal twist. Not only does it put an incredibly original slant on the vampire genre that is currently so popular, it also contains some of the most vividly painted characters I've come across for some time. From gruffly awkward Schuyler Van Alen, to girl about town Mimi Force, I felt I knew these teenagers intimately the moment they were introduced. The clever way the author combines the fantastical with the glitz and glamour of life among the rich and famous, gives the novel an authenticity that I loved. Although there is relatively little in the way of action, the tangled relationships between the characters and the subtle intrigue running beneath the surface kept me riveted throughout. Can't wait to read the next one!"
3,Eh....,"So the thing is, I was pretty bored through most of this book. The history part kind of threw me I also wasn't that crazy about the fact that vamps are reincarnated souls. Honestly it didn't do a whole lot for me and took me a lot longer to get through than most books. I plan to read the second one with hopes of it being better. The other thing that frustrated me a great deal was every other page we were hearing about what the characters were wearing (in great detail), it seemed like overkill. However, I do love vampires so I can't give it an entirely bad rating."
4,The book that helped me cope with Twilight,"I needed something to help me cope with finishing Twilight. It's not as romantic and passionate as Twilight but still has a good story and action to it. It keeps me sucked in. It's a different way of seeing how vampires really live within society. I think if you really liked Twilight, you'd really enjoy this too."
3,Boo-hoo,"I read the book cover-to-cover, and found it pretty easy to get through.However, an easy read doesn't make for a good read. Throughout the entire novel I got the feeling that the author was trying to make young female readers wish they were rich and famous, and young male readers horny.I loved the background of the vampires. An old myth revitalized.The storyline was okay. Good enough for three stars. However, I found the character horridly put together. Maybe I just don't like high schoolers. If you don't have a problem with teenage drama to the extreme (with vampire-esque creatures thrown in) pick this book up."
2,"Could have been good, but it just wasn't","I will be the first to admit that I am a fashion junky; I love reading Vogue and own a ludicrous amount of shoes... but COME ON!The plot itself would have been good, if not for the fact that, in detail, each piece of clothing that each character was wearing was described painfully in detail. What it was, where it was from, everything about it... and most of the clothes were cliche items such as the Chloe Paddington bag that the ""it"" girls in Hollywood at the time were carrying. By the end of it, I was so sick of the clothing descriptions, I had to put it down. De la Cruz should have spent more time fleshing out the characters and less time creating a written fashion show."
3,"Okay, but aren't books supposed to have endings?","This book is a little vapid, but enjoyable. The writing is so-so, but the plot has a lot to offer. De La Cruz, however, did not take advantage of that. I believe that a book, even if it is a part of a series, should have the ability to stand on its own as a good book. This one does not. There is no climax. The book ends with little excitement. I believe what should have been included in this book has probably been saved for the second book in the series, despite the fact that excluding those events makes this book only a little enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend it if you are willing to be disappointed by the ending (or lack thereof)."
3,It was alright,"Being and avid Twilight series fan i was very unsure of this book. I was disappointed and impressed at the same time. I was extremely impressed by the writing style. It was fluid and very well thought out, so in that regard it was a very good book. But for this being a book about vampires, there are just not enough vampires in it. For the first 100 pages or so the idea of vampires is simply mentioned and not explored. So, if you are a Twilight fan like myself, you will not only be disappointed in not reading about the vampires, but also be very disappointed in tn the way that the vampires that we have come to learn and love are not portrayed the same way. Also I thought it had a very weird story line."
3,Relationships need more detail,"This is a pretty good book and i really would give it 3.5 stars if i could. The only thing missing is that the relationships between characters are not developed enough. For instance, some of the characters meet each other briefly and suddenly they are in love, making the reader feel like they missed a whole chapter or something . The characters could use some more developement too, especially Schuyler."
2,Good if you like vapid thirteen year old writing,"I picked up this book on a recommendation from an online source to be a good alternative to Twilight. However it reads like a fashion-concious thirteen year old girl with all the name dropping about designers and long descriptions and little action. Do we really need to go on for 3 pages about the exact length and shade of someone's miniskirt? The quasi-incest of the Frost twins?I wish Mrs. De La Cruz would be introduced swiftly to a writing tutorial that is age-approriate for an adult writer instead of this ""hehe"" and ""lol""-inspired nature of this book. I felt insulted while attempting to read this poor excuse for a pretty cover of a novel."
1,Dismal and Boring,"Was this a book on fashion or vampires, I'm not quite sure? After struggling through the first 50 pages, I was so bored I took it back to the store and got my money back. Big YAWN on this spoiled brat teen society that is focused on what they wear, what designer labels they are and what snobbish department store they were bought in. A very disappointing book!"
1,Terrible example for young girls,"I recently finished reading another YA series about vampires, and thought I would give this book a whirl. To sum up, I was SHOCKED at the ideas portrayed in this supposedly YA novel. Sex, drugs, alcohol, and disobedience to parents filled the pages of this less than tasteful novel. I would never want my teenage daughter to read this and think that drugs and alcohol and teenage sex are cool. I am saddened to think that girls are reading this and thinking the behavior described is okay. If you are a parent, I would think twice about letting your child read this series, or any of this author's work."
4,Different take on your traditional vampire story,This was so not the book I expected it to be. I randomly found it in my suggestions for you section on here and thought I'd give it a try. I did not expect a vampire story with reincarnation in it. Such an interesting take on immortality. I thoroughly enjoyed this book
3,Review from One Book At A Time,"I really wanted to like this book. The description sounded great. But, in all honesty the story was seriously lacking. I know it's a young adult book, but the story felt very childish. The plot was good, and the were areas of good filler. But, for main substance, it just wasn't there. It felt like it was missing some details. I did like the main character and enjoyed the spin on the history of the Mayflower and the lost colony of Roanoke.*I do recommend to keep reading though. The series gets better with each book."
2,Blue Bloods.,"Alright.(on my defense this is my first written review)i did alot of background reading before i bought this book, the back cover sounded amazing. Scheyler sounded promising with forbiddin romance and paranormal creatures.But... turns out being a vamp isnt what this book is about. its more of a badly written soap opera that sucks(pun intended.)this book has three different narrerators. in all my favorite ya books i get to know the narrerator and feel like i get into character, this one every time i start to get a feel of sky(mimi, or bliss) i get to another short chapter with another person.Not a good series in my taste. AND I USUALLY LOVE CORNEY VAMP LOVE STORIES."
4,Blue bloods,Good quick read. Can not wait to start the next. Nothing else to say....blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
3,"Not awful, but not good either",So I read a lot of things like this and really this is the first series in a long time that I don't have any desire to finish. The characters do nothing for me and the writing is very predictable. Not my favorite.
3,Not what I expected,I picked this book to read because I thought it would be quick and not to banal for a weekend read. This book started off slow but then it captured me and really had me getting into it. It is a good read and I look forward to reading the others.
4,Definitely a good kind of different,"The title says it all. I'm usually pretty picky about my vampire stories, I tend to gear more towards Anne Rice's traditional plot. But Blue Bloods is definitely a good change. The Blue Bloods have a completely new world and lifestyle of being immortal. A great read."
3,made good on order,while i was not initially happy with its condition; the response from seller was swift and made good on offer. i would buy again
3,so so,not as engaging as i've heard it to be. there are moments that capture your attention and there are many moments of boredom
4,Great book!,I loved this book! The book kept me interested from the start! I cant wait for the next book to come out!
4,Love this Series,"Not the typical Vampire love story.. has several character views as well so if you aren't a fan of the main character you have several point of views.. I am currently working my way through the series and think Meliisa De La Cruz does a great job keeping you interested in the next book. There are several in this series and sometimes after the 3rd or 4th book you could leave it where it is, but with these the author sets up the next book very nicely."
4,Great book,Great twist to a vampire story. I liked the history in it. How it related to the mayflower and Plymouth.
2,Not worth time and money,"This book is not worth your time reading it, or the money. It's all about 500 dollar designer jeans, shoes, purses, cars, apartments, antiques - yawn - and other high price status symbols - a very shallow and materialistic theme runs right through the whole book. Does the author collect commission on the labels she constantly praises?? The vampire theme is thrown in as an afterthought, I guess because it sells.The main character, Schuyler, is being nicely developed, but the close relationship of the reader with Schuyler gets lost as soon as she gets involved in the predictable plot. I guess unexpectedly landing a job as a jeans model changed her mind about wearing unique and different outfits herself....?The plot is a bore, and nothing is resolved at the end of the book. A typical set-up to sell 'to be continued' endlessly. I for sure will not continue to read the series!"
4,Brain Candy,"This book is super cheesy brainless fun. It's a cross between Gossip Girl and Buffy the Vampire Slayer (ok, sorry Joss Whedon, it's not as smart and does not have the depth of Buffy. It's merely a vampire connection). I highly recommend for a fun afternoon of relaxing reading."
3,The Devil Wears Prada and Buffy's Love Child,"This was sort of The Devil Wears Prada and Buffy's love child. As a sci-fi/fantasy fan, it was not the greatest. There are far better vampire novels out there. That said, there was something to the story that makes me want to find out more. To be honest, I was having a hard time stomaching the constant designer name drops. I get it... they are young, powerful, and dressed to kill. Do I need to know that she is wearing Chanel boots? Hell no. As for the history part, it was almost hard to take. I'll give De La Cruz some points for originality; however, to anyone who knows anything about history, its going to be difficult to read. I guess it is one way to get girls who like ""chick lit"" into fantasy. I really wouldn't recommend this book unless you are really a De La Cruz fan."
4,Spoiled Rotten Vampire Teenagers,"Devoured it in a single setting. Blue Bloods is the lovechild of the Twilight series and the Gossip Girl books, but is far superior to either one of them. Set in Manhattan among society's elite, Blue Bloods tells the story of fallen angels, vampires, and a secret history.Considering the glut of books about vampires and privileged teens, Blue Bloods managed to stand out while still being just a good young adult book. It's not a literary masterpiece, but it's solid."
2,Does not compare to the Twilight series,"Although not an absolutely terrible read...if you are looking for something along the lines of the Twilight series this is not it. I actually picked this book up at my local bookstore on the recommendation of the sales person. I asked what she would suggest after reading the Twilight series which I LOVED but this book doesn't even come close. So if you are looking for something now that the twilight series is complete, this isn't it."
2,Not worth your time....,"Melissa de la Cruz's, Blue Bloods, offers a new take on vampirism. It is unique and has a lot of potential. Sadly, this book is confusing! You have no idea where the story is going and why it's going there.The story has some likeable teen characters and their relationships are pretty well developed. But in the end, you are left dumbfounded. So what is a blue blood? I have tons of questions, still unanswered.It seems to me that the author had lots of ideas that would have been great, but couldn't decide which to use and which to discard. I wouldn't recommend this book."
4,How Would You Like Your Music Served?,"Hopefully shaken and chilled, because Stigmato Inc's Reality Check is a great jazzy, loungey, housey, latiny CD. The lead singer's voice is a great complement to music and ""Strive To Be Happy"" is the tune to beat."
4,Aqua Sphere Swim Cap,I use the product because it covers my ears and helps prevent ear infections. I am very happy with it.
2,Nice while it lasted,"I was looking for a cap that would cover my ears. This one did. It didn't keep the water out completely, but it kept it out enough to be more comfortable. It was also big enough to hold my long hair. Unfortunately it only lasted for about a dozen wearings and then it ripped. I'm going back to my View cap which I've had for a couple of years now and is holding up well and gives a little more ear coverage than the Water Gear cap I also tried."
5,Makes swimming with a cap more fun,"I was looking for a swim cap that wouldn't be so tight on my head and wasn't too difficult to put on. I don't know of any cap that keeps the water completeley out, but this one does quite well. I am also finding that I very seldom get water in my ears. If I do, it usually means that that cap has shifted on the ears slightly - my fault of course (I lift up the ear areas to hear people talk better). Once I readjust the ear area, I'm water free again. The top and back of my head stay completely dry. The only place it might get wet is at the bottom neckline - again, I think it might be from me lift up the ear areas. All-in-all, I think it's a great swim cap."
1,Split,"I had high hopes for this swim cap. I used it the second time yesterday and while putting it on, it split apart near the ear area. I don't believe I was pulling it particularly hard (plus I have a small head). The material just tore apart, rendering it useless. I'm really sorry this happened. I'll just stick to cheaper swim caps."
2,did not fit!,I have a large head and this came to the tip of my ears.. so keep this in mind. its a good idea they just need to be sized.
1,Not What I Expected...,"I'm disappointed in this swim cap. I purchased it with the expectation that my hair would be ""somewhat"" wet in the back. What I got was hair that was ""drenched"" all over. I am sorely displeased. I was hoping to protect my color treated hair from the chlorine, but that isn't going to happen with this swimcap."
1,Too slippery - will not stay on...,"I put this swim cap on today, it slid up, I pulled it down, it climbed off my head like it couldn't wait to leave. Part of the problem is that it's too small. It's not too tight, in the brief moments it spent on my skull it wasn't uncomfortable. But it will not stay put. I'm between L and XL in drugstore sunhats, so not a small head, but not abnormally huge either. I have long hair but very fine, it doesn't add bulk.After wrestling with the Aqua Sphere Aqua Glide I got it on, anchored by my goggles. It crept up over my ears, but stayed on for a length, before popping off in the flip turn. I shall be sticking to the speedo bubble cap with chin strap. It might look less than fashionable, but at least I get to just put it on and swim."
4,Elegance at the Pool!,"This swim cap is soft, shiny, comfortable, and practical. It keeps the water away when worn properly. It does not pull the hair and can be taken off easily.I wear it every time I go to the pool. This unique swim cap adds comfortability, class, and elegance to my swimming experience!"
1,"Ripped for me, also.",who has these tiny heads? my 9 yr old had aproblem. most people r putting a head and hair un the cap. No wonder it tore.
3,Good while it lasted...,I bought this cap about 6 weeks ago and used it several times. I really liked the way that it fit. I wasn't looking for a cap to keep my hair dry. I usually get my hair wet and saturate it with conditioner prior to swimming to protect my hair from the chlorine in the water. Yesterday I went to put the cap on and it ripped right up the back along the rear seam!!! Not good. Fortunately a friend let me borrow hers so I was able to get my swim in. I'm going to try another Aquasphere cap because I really did like the fit. From reading other reviews ripping does seem to be an issue. I think it is poor design. I have several other Aquasphere products and they are outstanding. I think they need to go back to the drawing board and redesign the construction of this cap. Maybe no seams????
3,Only keeps hair out of face. Does not protect at all.,"It will not protect your hair from the water at all. I have long curly hair and it will take it all but I was looking for at least a little protection from the chlorine, this cap lets the water in and out like a sifter and it is not too big. It's simply not designed for that, apparently. If you are only interested in keeping your hair out of your face, then it'll do."
2,Too small...,"I have not been able to swim in the cap as it is so tight it gives me a headache after just a few moments on. I have not worn a swim cap since they were required at camp, but I don't remember them causing this much discomfort."
5,Swim Cap really protect ears,I can't get water into my ears and have had problems with swim caps rising up over my ears. This cap lives up to its description and is working well. I have a smallish head and medium short hair. Highly recommended.
1,purchase error,"I was looking for a swim cap that would protect my ears from water, not my hair. Unfortunately this does neither. In fact, I could not even get in on. Perhaps professional swimmers learn the ""tricks"" involved to get this type of cap on, but I couldn't do it. It slid off my hair whether I began at the top or bottom of my head, and was so stiff I couldn't even get it on by rolling onto my head."
5,High quality rubber eyecup,This is a high quality Nikon product as one expects from Nikon. The fit is nice and tight on the Eyecup retaining ring E-19K
4,Great accessory - Doesn't work on D200,"I purchased this for my D200, after reading in the Magic Latern Guide for the camera that it would work. Alas, no, it doesn't. Nothing wrong with the eyecup, though. I just wish there was one for my camera."
1,I believe that the Jehovah's Witnesses could be right,"There are a lot of religious leader out there who are afraid of losing their flock. They have nothing better to do than put down someone else's religion in order to justify their beliefs. Jehovah's Witnesses have long foretold that the United Nations will be empowered as a one world government and the U.N. will see organized religion as a threat to the peace and security of the world and abolish it. In the Washington Times, (Washington D.C., on April 27, 2005, there was an article titled 'WAR ON RELIGION.' This is what the Jehovah's Witnesses have been preaching for the past 90 years. It looks like their prophecies are beginning to unfold before our very eyes! Here is a link to the newspaper article if you do not believe me. http://www.washingtontimes.com/commentary/20050426-085533-3792r.htm"
5,Best Contra Dance/Listening CD,"I just love this CD. Clear calls, great music. I always play it to put me in a good. Makes you want to tap your feet and balance and swing, do-si-do, and allemende anyway you can!"
2,music good - calls unusable,"I'm from NH and have danced to these guys. Great music! The recording of the calls, however, is so poorly done that I am unable to use it in my classes. I have ended up stringing the music and recording my own calls. ""Let's all Square Dance"" does the job better and gives intro and instruction as well."
1,Be Careful,"This is a beautiful looking colander but there are quality issues. When I opened the package, the base of the colander was bent. Things happen in shipping and if that was all that was wrong I would simply request a replacement. The outside surface is fairly smooth. The inside is a different matter. When I was washing the inside, I scraped my knuckles and got a nasty cut. ALL the holes on the inside are as sharp as knives! I can't believe no one else has brought this issue up. Amazon may want to consider removing this colander for the safety of its customers."
1,Dangerous to your health!,"This book is based on traditional piano pedagogy wherein knowledge is passed from respected master to student, from generation to generation without ever attempting to prove anything using the scientific method. After all, the proof is in the playing...right?The book contains no references to any type of statistics, scientific research or experiments. As well the reader will find no discussion of the underlying anatomy or physiology. This book abounds with advice, which contradicts the scientific conclusions of modern functional anatomy.Many exercises are presented which are meaningless without proper ""how to"" instructions. There may be other useful information in this book but I was only concerned with the physical aspects of playing...."
1,Disappointed,I am an avid fan of these pretzels and order often. This particular box had a rancid smell and bad taste to them. I was very disappointed as I purchase these and the whole wheat pretzels often and have never have this problem before. I will hesitate to order again as they can't be returned. This particular product has no expiration date so it is difficult to determine shelf life but like I said I normally would give them 5 stars!!
5,Sesame Pretzels,This is a really great alternative to regular salty pretzels. We really like them as a snack and they are excellent to use instead of breadsticks for appetizers!
5,Addictive,"Crunchy, just enough salt and lots of sesame seeds--this is an addictive snack. Don'worry about buying a carton of packages from Amazon; it will disappear from your pantry soon enough even if you are just one person The price is very good, compared to that at the many supermarkets and Kosher markets that carry the stuff. I have always found Beigel and Beigel's snack products far superior in taste and texture to the competing Osem products."
3,Not so Mega and too salty,"I ordered these without having purchased them previously, so wasn't entirely sure whether I would like them. What I really wanted are Pretzel Rods without salt on the outside. That is, ""Baldies"" but in rod shape instead of twists. I have previously had sesame pretzels, and liked them, so thought this might be an acceptable substitute.However, these are much smaller/thinner than pretzel rods and are much saltier than needed given the sesame seeds. We'll use these, but I'll keep looking for a lower-salt pretzel rod."
1,"This cd shows the waste of talent of Marty, wowl","Skip this one, it's not Marty's best work(but what is???), thsi cd isn't at all romantic, and it just doesn';t do it for me, I'm sorry I love jazz, but this cd just doesn't have the charisma, or communication to the audience, what kind of funky instrumentation are they using, and the songs are just plain overdone, I think the problem here is the band, it doesn't take a rocket scientest to figure out that this cd should never have been released, sorry, but i can't recomend this cd."
1,Not loungy enough for me...,"This is just plain boring swing, there is no zing in the arrangements to make it special, or worth listening to more than once, this went straight from the cd player, into the waste basket. Not even one good uptempo song on the whole set. Boo!"
3,not so good election,"I recently bought the CD (I've got the export edition). I didn't have previous reference of Lana Lane, but I was interested on it becouse of the suggestion made by LMP on Luca Turilli first release. There is no doubt that Lana Lane is progresive, but I would say that is more Progresive-Rock, than metal at all. I like Lana Lane's material on this CD, but I was a bit desilutioned becosue I was looking for something more power metal, or progresive metal. Dispite this I think it was not too bad election and I'll be looking forward to get her latest release so I can make her a more informed critic.I recomend the export edition, two of the best song are from the Bonus tracks."
2,Best on the big screen,"The magic of the IMAX big screen is somewhat lost. The skiing is great but the camera work is very basic. There is little to no point-of-view material. Following a skier with a helicopter or sitting back a mile away with a telephoto lens doesn't capture the real thing for a small screen. The skiing is also limited to long takes of slaloming movement which everyone has seen. Then again, maybe I just need a bigger TV."
3,Extremely absorbing,"It confounds me that the makers of this film decided to separate this whole IMAX film EXTREME into two parts - winter & summer - in its DVD release. Nevertheless, the film is just magnificent when shown in a widescreen or giant screen TV although nothing compares to the IMAX experience. A lot of its impact is lost on your own home since it's just jaw-dropping to see how majestic and incredible the mountains of Juneau, Alaska. The snowboarding & skiing footages are shot mostly from a chopper hovering above, and there's only one shot of a rider with a camera trailing behind (due to the fact that the runs are very steep and the camera weights around 50 pounds). The ice-climbing is quite tedious but shows how dangerous the climb is. Overall, an above-average effort. The EXTREME summer edition shows more adrenaline though."
5,Magical!,"This film is just so beautifully shot. Not only is the photography amazing, but the Alaska scenery will live on in your memory, and the music is fantastic too. The CD soundtrack from this film is restful and unusual, and is one of my favourites. I'm not even an athlete, and wouldn't have thought a film about snowboarding, skiing, surfing and ice-climbing would appeal to me at all. But all I can say is this is truly a work of art."
1,Horrible,This is not a ski or snowboard or an 'extreme' sport movie. It is a making of a movie. And it therefore is horrible. This is essentially the making of the IMAX movie EXTREME. You learn about lighting and how to put together a camera boom. Yipppeee! There is this repetitive tribal beat in the background that gets really annoying. And guess what? It gets even better. There is a making of bonus section! You get the making of ... the making of EXTREME for IMAX. Don't waste your money on this. I personally will never buy another movie from this production company.
1,Horrible,"I have many ski/'extreme' movies. This is not one of them. It is essentially the making of the IMAX movie EXTREME. I don't care how they got the camera shots or about the lighting. And guess what..it includes a making of bonus feature. You get to see the making of...the making of EXTREME for IMAX. Don't waste your money, and I will never buy another movie from this company."
4,its a bowl,"i got this as a replacement for a bowl that my friend broke. my old bowl was one of those in the set with the lids. Seeing this one doesnt come with a lid, i was hoping that just the size (2 1/2 quarts) would be universal for pyrex products, i took a chance and ordered it. the worse that could happen is i would have a new bowl and have to toss out the old lid, but i was excited that it actually fit the old bowl's lid. yay!"
5,Nice basic bowl,"Very durable, multi-purpose bowl (I have the set and use every size). Had them for years and not a single chip, crack, or flaw. Highly recommended."
4,Great Pyrex,"I love the weight of this bowl. I use this bowl for mixing,serving and storing small quantities of leftovers. I am a fan clear bowls. This 2 1/2 quart Pyrex Prepware bowl handles all of my small baking, mixing,serving and storage needs. I have also purchased the 4 quart Pyrex Prepware bowl. I plan to order additional Pyrex Prepware."
1,insanely OVERPRICED!!,Even from Pyrex site you can get a set of three for less than what you pay here for one!
5,intelligence + wit = hilarity,"When you set three wise guys loose in the office, you're going to get something unpredictable, funny and smart. ""Wise"" is the operative word here--all the things you were told not to be in high school. Or most anywhere else. Nothing is exempt! I wouldn't be exempt, or you, or the authors--everything goes. Go with it, you'll like it!"
5,Stooples Humor,"This book was hilarious! For anyone who has ever worked in an office setting, it's a must-read when you need a good laugh. This would make a good gift for co-workers and bosses with a sense of humor!"
5,An excellent sci-fi high tech novel,"Even though I tend to lean more toward the more standardized sci-fi or space opera type of books, from the Old Masters to the New: ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Puppet Masters"", ""Foundation"", ""2001"", ""2010"", ""Rendezvous with Rama"", ""Ringworld"", all the ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" books, ""Advent of the Corps"" and others."
3,"Supposedly ""New"" book","I specifically ordered a ""new"" book and paid for it accordingly. what arrived looked new, but reeked of tobacco smoke so badly that I was unable to read it without getting ill. I finally had to spray the book, page by page with Lysol and hang it on a clothesline to dry."
4,First class space opera,"Updates the genre with nanotech and AI vying for citizenship. Very entertaining. Annoyingly, quits in the middle for the obvious sequel."
3,Worthwhile...,"Others have described the plot very well. I almost gave up on this because of the seemingly ridiculous ""science"" in this science fiction. I found myself skimming through much of the ""scientific"" explanations and just took this universe on faith. So it became more of a fantasy for me. Also, I found the creation of the evil Ames and the interesting Jill characters somewhat sickening. Still, I found most of the characters very interesting and I was rudely surprised to find that I have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens.At the end of this, I was reminded of the Hyperion series by Simmons, although it clearly is not in the same league. Any interesting read--glad I persevered."
2,Here We Go Again,"Do we need another ""universe?"" I think it's time to rename the whole genre - SciFi has become ScamFi. Why do I get the feeling that these authors have no intention of ever telling a coherent story again; that all they want to do is create a ""universe"" where they can earn a few bucks by putting out another chapter in a never-ending story every couple of years.This book started out well-enough, but my dense mind caught on to the fact that the plot wasn't going to be resolved at about page 300 (out of over 400). There were just too many loose ends, with not enough pages remaing to tie them all up.Science fiction used to be fun and intriguing. Now, thanks to books and authors such as this, it is only plodding and pointless. Have we as an audience really become so unsophisticated?"
2,"Well, it isn't as bad as Warpath.","One of the worst books I've read in the sci-fi genre. Outlandish tech, horrible storyline, paper-thin characters... this is ALMOST as bad as Warpath."
1,Would make a nice Sci-Fi TV series,"The two main stumbling blocks that brought me to abandon this novel at page 67 was the scifico-babble (similar to psychobabble) terms like ""grist"", that are not defined up front or somewhere close to the beginning of the book, and, for me, the necessary ingredient of clarity/coherence. The reader is forced to jump in and immediately believe the alien concepts of life forms in the far distant future without a ""glossary of terms"" as it were that enhance the reading experience from page one. I regret that tossing the reader into the incomprehensible does not work for me."
2,Not if you like hard SF,Too much meaningless verbiage - Too little knowledge of how the universe actually works. Belongs in the fantasy section midway between the Oz books and Perdido Street Station.
3,Where are we going?,"Keel, 14 year old gambler, and his secret love, Isla, barely survive the attack on their city. They find themselves on the rogue submarine, the U.S.S. Ulysses, run by Captain Gould. Captain Gould has declared war against the newly formed United Nations. The United Nations has been trying to slowly bring civilization back to the planet Earth after most of the land mass was flooded 14 years ago, killing over 6 billion people.In fact Gould is the one that attacked and partly destroyed the city Keel and Isla were living in! Is he insane? Is he some kind of pirate? And just who is Keel? Why was his twin working for Gould? Why would anybody attack the United Nations?The DVD has four episodes full of military actions, high adventure, confusing flashbacks, knowing stares, breast feeding, and one ugly sub. One gets the feeling that the creators are trying to do everything at once. Humor, drama, adventure and action all stuffed into one series. Will they pull it off? I dunno."
5,Absolutely beautiful,"This CD has the most beautiful music; evokes fond memories, relaxing and just overall delightful. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys and savors terrific music!!"
3,blah music,"I usually like mellow, slow instrumental music, but this cd just reminds me of elevator music, or the music they play at a market or in a dr.'s office. Sorry."
3,Not What I Expected,"I loved the show Survivor and couldn't wait until Wednesday evenings to see what would happen next. When I heard about the new album, I was very excited and couldn't wait to get one. I like song 1, ""Ancient Voices"" (an extended version of the opening of the show), ""Tally the Vote"", and the last song ""Ancient Voices (Main Title Theme). These 3 songs bring back ""memories"" of the program and the people on the island. The other 15+ songs did not appeal to me. I think I expected more of the songs to remind me of the show."
2,Not a good buy,"I was really hoping for something else. The theme song is GREAT, of course, but the rest of the CD is filled with REALLY bad music. Unless you must have this one, I would pass."
3,Only for Hardcore Fans.,"I bought this CD back in my Survivor days. I was obsessed with Season Two, but never liked the other Seasons! I dunno, I guess the CD is alright, it's not my favorite. I only really listened to the beginning theme and the song that they played during the voting out ceremony. Only buy it if you are a hardcore fan, otherwise just skip it altogether! Enjoy! (maybe)"
4,Cool Sounds that will take you back to the first Survivor,"I have to say that this Soundtrack almost contain all music usedin the first Survivor season.. the theme, the musci used during challenges, and even during the voting! It's tribal music mixed with new age sounds that helps complete the all-natural settingfor this show, it has all the components plus it is a great listening material. If you are into these kinda sounds and love it, or want a good Survivor memorabilia for your collection, you got to have this one, it's worth it!"
1,vote it off the island,"Vote this one off the island: 19 overproduced prog-tropical instrumentals consisting entirely of primitive thumping, chanting and grunting - sort of a new age tribal orgy with pygmy porn music composed by Phil Collins. It's all supposed to convey the drama, intrigue and relevance of a TV show (Survivor Yell, Mud Bath, Chase Race, Tally the Vote, I Can See It, Buzzed) with no drama, intrigue and relevance. A desperate last ditch dig for one of the most unimportant moments in television."
1,Come On People!!!,"While I am a HUGE fan of the show, I could not believe that this CD was made. I listened to an advance copy of this CD and it is truely AWFUL!!!!! Keep in mind that this CD is BASED on the Survivor show. Other than the ""main theme"", none of the tracks on this cd actually appear on the TV show. Musically, this album is a real bore. Believe me...the NEW AGE music on this CD makes YANNI seem interesting. PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS CD. It is just another album of recycled new age music that is remotely reminicent of the great CBS show."
4,Gotta love that music!,"The music was actually the thing that made me start to watch the show on a regular basis. I think that without this wonderful score, the show wouldn't have been as popular. It helps set the mood (or atleast what the producers want the mood to seem like) for every episode."
3,Not a bad sound!,I bought this CD for the title track on the TV show. I thought it was pretty cool and the stuff on the rest of the Cd isn't that bad either. Definately think about it.
4,"Going, going, gone","This Cd should be a sellout! If you watched the show and got hooked (like me) then this is an awsome CD, even if you didn't get hooked it's a great CD. The sounds are just amazing. Before you go out and buy Eminem or Dr. Dre look for this. I have a felling it is going to be a great price. All I have to say is taht you would be crazy not to get this. At first chance, just get it!! :)"
3,I've hear this somewhere's before......,"The title song that starts with the conch shell has a similar vocal sound to a new-age recording released 1986/7. It sounds like Kurski Funk from ""Earth Beat"" by Paul Winter. (The sound track is okay but I like the jazz/world beat version by Winter.)"
1,Very remenicent of Survivor the show...,If you saw Survivor the show and have at least one brain cell you will not enjoy this cd at all. On the other hand if you like to bang two sticks together and wobble around (calling it dancing) this cd is just right for you!
4,total satisfaction,Iam toyally satisfied with my purchase.The product was of a high quality and the price was just right for me.
3,Great,This book came right on time but I should have asked questions about whether or not the pages were highlighted or not but the seller and the product was wonderful
4,Al Green's CD,My Mother-in-law lost her cd and wanted a new one with love and happiness on it because she loves Al Green.
3,GREAT PAGE TURNER - GOOD CHARACTERS - OKAY WRITING,"This is the first book I've read by Scottoline. She has a real facility for moving a story along and her characterizations grabbed me. I did have some problems with her writing skill, from time to time; she used a lot of linear temporality and echo word that distracted and slowed the pace. These problems could easily have been fixed with a better edit. One example of these problems was the repeated use of the word 'suddenly' to move the action along. This is a mild complaint, especially for those who are not nitpicking writers, like me, looking for what works and doesn't work in books. And some of her metaphors are surprisingly fresh!The best feature of this book, for me, was protagonist's struggle with her sexual addiction. It gave Cate a fresh, vulnerable appeal -"
1,Horrible story,"This is probably the worse book I've read in a long time, everything from the characters to how the story unfolds is awful. The first couple chapters had potential but, it all goes downhill very soon after that. I don't recommend this to anyone, whether your a fan of hers or not. This was the first book I've read from this author and, this will be the last one."
2,Missing the mark,"This is an atypically poor book by Lisa Scottoline. Neither the plot nor the characters were developed, believable or even very likeable. Hoping that the next one will be back to her usual standards."
2,Disappointing book from a great author,"I have always enjoyed Lisa's books, and in general this was no exception, but I was disappointed by the plot. There wasn't really any continuity in the plot. There didn't seem to be any reason for Russo to come to his conclusions about Cate. The reason for Cate's behavior was never really explored; the killer was an odd choice and finally the death of a peripheral character was not consistent--there would have been fingerprints of both women in the room. That was a back story that wasn't developed. This book could have used some editing."
1,Too predictable and cliche,"Miracles happen in this book. Is there an illness? Well, then you can expect a ""cure"" by the end. Is there a lesson, then our heroine will learn it, in the most amazingly trite, unimaginative manner. Don't waste your money on this drivel. Better get an Archie comic book, where, believe it or not, there you will find more complex characters. This author owes me $24.00 and 4 hours."
3,Entertaining enough to finish,"With all the books I start and don't get around to finishing, this is something.The story resembled an unrefined Turow story, which is both good and bad, sometimes Turow gets too deep into the details, but he usually pulls it off, here she tries to develop characters too deeply, or at least tries to insert too many of them into the story and it shows a bit too much.At any rate, it was a page turner despite it's flaws, I stayed engaged and enjoyed the read."
3,Fun Escapism,"This was a fun book, the perfect summer beach read. There is action, romance, witty dialogue, and a plot that will keep you interested. I plan to read more books by Lisa Scottoline!"
3,"Average, but worth reading.","Didn't enjoy Dirty Blonde as much as I had hoped to, but found it ok. The only character that is relatively compelling is Judge Cate Fante but not quite. Fantes problems and subsequent visits to a therapist to solve, would just be a token gesture in the real world (the being solved by a therapist part) particularly considering her position, not at all realistic. Parts of the story elicited the sexual voyeur in me as a reader, but quickly faded as the sordid nature of Fantes habits surfaced. Other than that the murder and mystery mixed with personal problems give this book a fair amount of appeal."
3,Ending Ruined it for Me,"I listened to this book on CD. Really enjoyed Barbara Rosenblatt's narration. Was enjoying the book. Lisa writes with a lot of energy and humor. Then apparently she woke up in a different world. The perpetrator came out of left field, with no solid basis for the crime. One story line was left unresolved, and a new one introduced in the last few paragraphs. Was very disappointed."
2,Incomplete,"This book was so-so, no big thriller. It seemed in-complete to me. I think she forgot to fill in a couple of the blanks. I won't go any further, read it for yourself but wait for the paperback. This book was very disappointing, not well thought out and half done."
1,Ridiculous,"This book was just over-the-top ridiculous. And there were too many things that I found annoying, such as how the characters kept referring to an almost-3-year-old child as ""the baby""."
4,A great read,"This book as a real page turner. Enjoyed it had a lot of twist and turns, and a ending that could not figure out."
4,A Judge with a Secret Life,Dirty Blonde is a very entertaining page turner. Cate is an interesting character. She was not perfect and did have a mean streak. She was real although her insights were at times hard to believe.The story moves along very well. It also has some interesting side characters such as her friend's son Warren and the moral issue involving whether Cate should sue the Court. As other reviewers said the end was not satisfying. I admit I did not see who did it early on which may only prove I am not as sophisticated a reader. I also thought her trip to her home and the issues concerning her early life was a distraction from the story and did not add muchThis was first Scottoline book and I will read more in the future.
1,Please Give Us a More Worthy Heroine,"The writing is very competent, but I had a major issue with the main character. Perhaps because I am so sick of seeing real life people in positions of power abusing their office, I have to give this book only one star. Cate Fante is a federal judge, yet when a man she picks up in a seedy bar dies under suspicious circumstances, does she come forward? No. Instead, she endangers the people around her. The other thing I took issue with was the casual way people address themselves in her private chambers: ""Hey, girl, ""Whatcha gonna do?"" ad nauseam (OK, so that's Latin, but anything is better than this street-speak in halls of higher learning and judgment). I'm half way through the book and was curious to see what other readers thought. The only reason I might finish the novel is in the hope that this judge gets her just desserts, but somehow I don't think she will as the story is so contrived and manufactured."
4,"Will read more of her books to form a better opinion, but....","I did like this book, the first I've read by this author. I thought the heroine was a bit unlikely, especially in that she engages in an extrememly dangerous habit and seems to suffer none of the obvious consequences - getting beaten up (actually bruised, not threatened), raped, contracting STDs, etc. But....it's entertainment, right? Some parts of the book were very funny, and for that I'm willing to deal with the unrealistic parts. For reference, I also like Janet Evanovich, Robin Cook, Linda Fairstein, and Jonathan Kellerman - if you agree with me on those, you will probably enjoy this one too."
4,good book,I actually borrowed the book from my library and I wasn't finished before it was due. It was interesting enough that I wanted to buy it.
1,Annoying,"I have not yet purchased this book yet, but I'm wondering if there is a point in purchasing it? I say this because half of the reviews on some of these kindle books give the whole book away! Why do people do this? I like reading the book description provided by the author, but when I scroll down to see if people like it, instead of finding opinions, I find the whole book pretty much written out word for word! What's up with this? I guess if I write a review, it will be more along the lines of, ""Loved this book, couldn't set it down!"" or ""Made me laught out loud"" I guess I love to read and to get my full money's worth out of it, I don't want somebody else spoiling it for me."
3,not one of her best,"I enjoy Lisa Scottoline's mystery books. I especially love the Rosato & Associates ones because of the great stories & characters. This is a non-series novel & definitely one of the weaker books overall. Judge Cate Fante just isn't a good character. She isn't the strong, independent, smart women I've come to know & expect from Lisa's writing. And the mystery itself is far too long with unnecessary plot twists that don't add anything.It's still a good book but not a great Lisa Scottoline legal mystery."
3,Simplistic legal drama,"Not the best legal drama by a long way.I decided to read Scottoline as I really enjoy the Linda Fairstein novels about Alex Cooper (a sex crimes prosecutor), unfortunately Dirty Blonde which is about a female judge who gets caught up in a personal scandal and a murder (to boot) is nowhere near as good as the Alex Cooper series. The character is unlikeable, the writing has moments of pace but not enough and the plot is too unbelievable and simplistic especially the ending.If you like legal thrillers and are looking for something new you could try Dirty Blonde, at the end of the day I didn't stop reading it, however if you haven't all ready tried Linda Fairstein I would rate her over Scottoline."
4,I Am Hooked,"This is the second book I have read from this author and loved both of them. She writes with a ""light touch"" than does not drag you down, but the story, plot and characters are just too fascinating to put the book down. The two books I have read had humor to make you laugh as well as characters to love and hate and plots that made you hold your breath for an instance. I would recommend this author to anyone who loves mysteries, good characters and a story that is easy to read but get caught up in"
3,"quick fun read, but skip over the brand names!","This novel is easy to read & the plot speeds along quickly. The characters were a bit predictable, but not objectionably so. Similar to some of the other readers, however, I was very distracted by all the trendy brand names that are mentioned over and over again. O.K., already. Once we have established that Cate is more taken with the fact that the bracelet came from Tiffany's rather than the bracelet itself, the giver, or (heaven forbid) the thought behind the bracelet--we don't need further explanation into her super-materialistic mindset. That said, I always enjoy the humorous voice in Scottoline's stories, and Dirty Blonde did not disappoint in that respect. Unfortunately, the ending ruined the story for me--it came from somewhere beyond left-field. Loose ends seemed to be glued together with artificial cheer. Enjoy it as a quick fun in an age of excess and consumerism."
4,A strong summer read.,"Scottoline changes things up a bit. The lead is not a young perky, pretty attorney from Philadelphia. This one is headed up by Cate Fante, a 39 year old, newly-appointed Federal judge from East-central Pennsylvania (but not Philadelphia) with a secret life of anonymous sex with strange men she picks up in bars (not a spoiler - you find out by page 5).Her secret life soon explodes into her professional life and her whole life becomes a deadly mess when a case she presided over turns murderous.An entertaining read. I give this one a B+."
3,adequate for what I need,"The directions were a very poor photocopy and sparse indeed. Thank goodness I was an engineer but I still had to refer to the illustrations on the carton to figure out the assembly.Also I was unable to fit the handle fully into the frame bars so that the handle, frame and top tool holder could all be bolted together (I was able to bolt the top section to the handle however. It appeared that the insides of the frame bars had rusted and that was preventing full insertion.This will serve its purpose, using a trash bag instead of the mesh harvest bag included, for holding my yard trimming tools and the trimmings and save me several trips back and forth lugging stuff, but I would not purchase another."
2,Too flimsy to hold heavier gear,"I bought this stand a few years ago and I rarely use it. In fact, I sold it at a recent garage sale. My main complaint is that it was too flimsy to hold any heavier gear, such as a metal rake or push broom. For just toodling around the garden it's OK. But now I use a big wheelbarrow to cart my stuff around instead."
3,a good garden cart,It is a well made product and works great except a paper lawn bag does not fit very well in it.
2,"VERY BASIC ""COMPLETE GUIDE""","AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN OUT OF THE SPORT FOR 10 YEARS AND LOOKING TO GET BACK IN, I BOUGHT THIS BOOK EXPECTING MORE. THE BOOK STARTS OUT WITH A GOOD HISTORY OF THE 3 WHEELED ATV, BUT DOESN'T ELABORATE TOO MUCH ON QUADS. (WHAT ABOUT THE MID 80'S SUZUKI'S - QUAD SPORT/QUAD RACER?) ANOTHER DOWN FALL OF THE BOOK IS THAT IT STRONGLY FOCUSES ON UTILITY ATV'S AND RARELY MENTIONS SPORT MODELS. AS FAR AS THE MAINTENANCE SECTION OF THE BOOK... IT ...."
3,SUSPENSFUL,"This is a suspensful film, but the acting is a little bland. It wasn'tbelievable. No one around 5 minutes after the mall closes? How did all the employees get out that had to close up?I did love the ""miracle"" ending though. I DO believe that in a situation such as this, God most assuradly can make something happen when all otherssay it is impossable."
1,Run...Hide...from this movie,"Sometimes a movie could have been good, but it just misses the mark. If only the budget had been higher, the acting better, etc.This is not that movie. Supposedly based upon a true story(which I was interested enough in to watch all the DVD features...nothing more than a passing reference), this movie has enough plot to fill out 7 minutes, and it pads it out with 65 minutes of filler. The acting of the lead is decent, but everyone else is pretty awful. The scares range from dumb to cheesy, and most of the ""thrilling"" bits are direct steals from John Carpenter'sHalloween.As far as budget issues go, the filmmakers needed to realize their limitations and not shoot 90% of the movie at night if they can't afford to light it well enough to be watchable. It is literally impossible to tell what is going on in most of the scenes in the movie.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
1,Could not even finish the movie,"After about 40 minutes the children rebelled and demanded we turn this movie off. Poor acting, slow, pitifully slow plot, terrible sound and just down right boring."
1,really disappointed,"this book is full of outdated and contradictory information. makes me wonder if they did any of their homework. they lump butter and margarine together and treat it as one food. on page 18 alcohol protects the brain from dementia, on page 27 it accelerates the progression of alzheimer's disease (just one of many contradictions). save your money"
2,Unimpressive,"This book gives the preception of abundant health knowledge, and although it covers many foods it really dose not give much useful information. I also wander about its accuracy. Read page 14 "" Dose Chinese restuarant syndrome really exist?"" I dont think this book is for those who really want to be healthy and stay away from the doctor. Ask those whos teeth have been destroyed by fluoride then see if you agree with the statments under ""Did you know?"" on page 129. Do a web search on flouride and see if it agrees with what this book says. This is a great book for those who want to consume the American diet and preceive, that they are healthy while doing so."
3,Need credit,I returned this product weeks ago and still have not rec'd my credit. The product was good just not what I needed.
2,Leaky,As previous reviewers have noted there is a leaking issue with thin watery products. I found this to be true of the flip tops and the screw on tops.
3,Some sizes not TSA friendly...,"Good quality containers, but some are too big for carry-on travel. I have found a good container for carry-on bags: Sure Lid lock seal containers. They have not leaked (I even put mouthwash in them and it doesn't leak). Hope this info helps...Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * TSA Airplane Friendly 1.5 ounce - 2 per pack"
4,smells strange,"The small ones are in good quality. However, three of them smells quite strange just like someone has used them."
4,Beware: Not Carry-On compatible!!!,"These are great. They are light, well constructed, cheap. But the large bottles, which fit shampoo, etc very well, are 125mL, and the max capacity of FAA carry-on liquids is 100mL. So know that. ""Travel"" does not mean ""Carry-On.""Otherwise great."
4,Groovelock Pliers,"My husband is the handy man at our house, so this review comes courtesy of his experiences using them: he likes the fact that the groove-lock is adjustable and makes repairs easier because he can fit them into the space required. He says that as wrenches go these are pretty large so you'll need a smaller size for other repairs. At this price, they are a bargain."
2,Good concept,"I bought these at an autozone a few months ago. They looked cool and I needed a pair of pliers. Anyway, these things are good for lite duty work. I was doing a plumming job and used these to tighten a nipple on a steam trap, and the frikken top part of the jaw cracked off.They were working fine the few times I used them, and they are kinda tricky to get used to, but they are useful for quick and lite tightening of bolts and what not. The shape of the jaw made it quicker and easier just grab onto something. Very comfortable grip too.Dunno what these things arer intended to be used for, but they dont seem to be made for plumming or fitting or anything heavy duty. Wish they were stronger. Dunno what kind of warranty Irwin has either."
3,"favorite hairdryer, but doesn't last","This hairdryer is quieter than most and works great. I owned three, but that was the problem. I purchased it three times because I loved it so much. However, each hairdryer lasted less than a year, and I used it probably four times per week. I was very disappointed in what seemed to be a great hairdryer of poor quality in that was unable to last. Sad to have to switch to something more reliable!"
3,It's OK,"As the definition of 3 stars indicates, ""it's OK"". It works as expected and includes an average number of attachments for hair dryers in this price range. It has sufficient blowing power and operates comparable to any other hair dryer I have owned over the past 35+ years. The ""Ionic Ceramic Styling System"" is a BS gimmick in my opinion. It doesn't provide any noticeable difference in performance or in the way my hair feels or acts afterwards. As someone else has mentioned, the color I received is black/white, not black/silver. This had nothing to do with my rating... just an observation that has yet to be corrected in the description of the item.Also, on a side note, the prices on Amazon sometimes fluctuate too much. I bought this item less than two weeks before writing this review. I paid under twenty, and now it's twenty-five. IMO, that's quite a jump for such a short timeframe, and I would have selected another model given today's price."
4,"If it was supposed to black/silver, someone must be COLOR BLIND",the blow dryer delivered to me was white and black...it was not the silver/black that I ordered but it does dry my hair.
1,Not what I ordered,"This dryer no longer includes the straightener attachment as pictured and referred to by previous customers. It is also black and white. I got one that had item number 121PR, returned it, and got the same thing with the item number 121PX. Be aware this item is not as shown. I did not try it because it was wrong."
1,Conair Ionic Ceramic Styler,Product is not the color described. Supposed to be black and white but is actually purple. Not what I ordered.
1,Dissapointing Low quality hair dryer,"I ordered this conair hairdryer to replace a different model conair hairdryer that was great but had stopped working after 3 years of heavy use. From the first time I used this model I found the airflow to be weak. After using it twice, the words next to the settings had smeared and are now almost completely rubbed off.Do not buy this model."
3,COULD BE BETTER,"This isn't a bad dryer at all. It comes with diffuser and concentrator, both of which work well. It has a good range of temps/speed, plus a cool shot button. It dries quickly without crisping my hair. I had to ping it, however, because the print (that designates hi, low, etc) next to the speed and temp controls wore off within days. I tried re-writing them in with a sharpie but no luck. I just found this annoying -- got smudgy fingers plus if I put this aside for any amount of time I have to ""re-learn"" what's what. I've had every kind of hair appliance over the years and never had this problem before. Too bad, because otherwise this is a terrific little dryer."
5,Must-read for anyone trying to promote a service business!,"I've just started a consulting business and I have no marketing experience. I've also realized this business is more than consulting, I need to learn how to sell myself!Most marketing books focus on ""product"" marketing - a lot of their methods do not apply to service marketing. This book is fun to read and applies marketing methods specifically to service businesses and provides real-world actions you can take today to promote your business with little or no money! I've already implemented some of the methods. I love this book!"
3,Not so cool,"I read this book after being promoted to Product Manager. I was hoping to get more insight and do my job better, but it was too poor in some aspects.The book is good, but not so good, unless you haven't heard of marketing before.Anyone with a little imagination could come up with the ideas showed in the book.I guess it is aimed at people with personnal business and offering only services like lawyers. It is very usefull for independent consultants. I am a consultant, but work for a company, so it didn't help too much. If you work for a company, then don't waste your time and money."
5,good for everything,"This album can help you sleep, wake you up, get you in the mood, get you out of the mood, etc, etc. It has the ability to enhance what you're feeling. If you like trance, Enigma or just music in general, you should give it a try."
1,Huh ? Why has my gun jammed ?,"Believe it or not, Bill Holmes almost got a contract to sell this gun back in the 80's, but it was dropped in favor of the H+K MP-5. Perhaps the reason for this was that the MP-5 actually had an EJECTOR for discarding spent rounds, essential for allowing any sub machine gun to work properly. Strangely enough, this gun doesn't seem to have an ejector (or anything resembling or acting as one), nor are there any instructions for making it. That, along with the fact that there are references to diagrams that don't exist suggest that either Bill Holmes knows nothing or the stupid publisher has omitted essential material. Either way : Avoid this book like the plague."
3,"OK, I GUESS","Never tried building it. You'd need a barrel and a lathe to make it. Making it as a pistol would be fun (you can get a licence for that here). What annys me is the reference to chemicals that I don't thing is available here in Europe (and that the measurements is not in metric, of course)."
4,Car Baby II user review,"I have the Car Baby II, looks a little different. I bought a half dozen, use one, and gave several as gifts. It works fine, I'm happy with it. The sound quality is pretty decent - better than the Nokia speaker unit I used, much better. Mine works on 88.9 or 106.7 MHz - you should make sure one of these two bands is unused in your area! You do have to turn up the radio volume a little bit for best results, but I find it very easy and effective to use."
1,Wouldn't take it for free,This is a peice of junk. The felt fell off after I put the battery in for the first time. It weighs a few ounces and probably costs 5c to make. That would be OK if were enjoyable to use and worthwhile. Instead it is a pain to use. I bought one for me and my wife. Both are now in the trash.
5,Excellent set. - wish written material was in English,"This is an excellent set of recordings for the lovers of Il Divo music. The calendar and booklet pictures are excellent. The written material (calendar, booklet and small booklet) are all in either Japanese or Chinese and the calendar is for 2007 (when the set came out)."
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this compilation. I was expecting interesting gangster movie themes, and what I received was slow, somber, no-tempo love themes from some very cool crime movies. The tracks from Once Upon a Time in America put me to sleep, and the Ballad of Machine Gun McCain embarrassed me in front of all my friends. Don't get me wrong--it is gangster movie music--it's just NOT COOL gangster movie music. I felt ripped off because I was expecting stuff that sounded like what Morricone did for the film Diabolik, instead I get two discs filled with elevator music."
5,Just as advertised,Cool little gas cans that fit into my pannier hard cases for my TW 200 motorcycle. Nice that they are shaped taller vs wider.
5,Emergency gas,I use it in my side bags on my TW200.Nice feeling to have some extra gas when you are out in the middle of nowhere.
4,Good Overall DVD,"This DVD gives a good sampling of the different genres of electronic music. Especially good are ""Poison"" by Prodigy and ""Brown Paper Bag"" by Reprazent....P.S.-anyone who knows what ""industrial"" music is will know that this selection isn't!"
3,"Nice collection, but a bit lopsided","I can understand the limited freedom to do a proper collection of eye-catching music videos on DVD due to label and license limitations, but maybe we could have dug a LITTLE bit deeper here? You have the obligatory ChemBros and FatSlim videos, and a nice selection of drum & bass videos which most people would never have seen before (including the nifty Sly & Robbie ""Superthruster"" video and Goldie's ""Temper Temper""), but a little more diversity in electronic music styles would have been nice. Some house, some trance? But for what it is, it's a welcome addition to any music video DVD collection."
5,Best sound on a DVD,"Besides the perfectly chosen videos, I think what makes this compilation a must have is its amazing sound quality. If you have an AC3 home theater system with this DVD you will know it was worth every penny. Add to this awesome visuals and great concepts (like the backgammon of love life depicted in ebtg's future of the future) and you'll agree with me that this DVD deserves the 5 stars."
4,Rocks My Monkey,"Pretty cool disc, my funk soul brutha. Some great tunes on here, and some good tunes on here.The Mothership has to be SUPERTHRUSTER though, which has a fine sound split across the 6 audio tracks. I love that track.This disc finds its way into my DVD player more than most."
4,Great guide to electronica,"This is a really cool DVD simply because it is like one of those compilations of popular ""electronica"" with the videos included. I liked seeing the videos to some of my old, favorite songs (Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Underworld, etc.) and disovering some news acts such as Deep Dish."
1,Disappointed,"Hi,I was very excited when I received the item and found it to be well packed and with no damage at all. It seemed to be well made but was made with thinner stock than I expected. I am sure that is a main way to keep costs of construction down. I liked the adjustable wires, but it took me a little while to figure them out. when I sat down to play it, I was very disappointed at the poor sound that it produced. It was thin and dead. I have played others and they are very different. I also found the front plate to be loose and the adjustment screws seemed to be either stripped or made no difference in the sound of the instrument. based on other reviews I think that I may have received a defective one but was not willing to try again. I am saving my money and plan to buy a hand made instrument that I know sounds great. Amazon allowed me to return it for a full refund, for which I was very glad ."
4,Very good.,"I just got this off Amazon MP3, and was surprised. I actually heard a track off last.fm, and this band caught my attention. Some of these songs are just cool, but that guitar work on some of these songs show that they can rock. They remind me of Pearl Jam in a good way.Also, I think it makes excellent background music because I feel that it would appeal to a wide audience, and I didn't find anything particularly offensive.Unlike a lot of albums where I delete tracks, I haven't done it to this one."
5,Excellent Album Worth The Cost,"As did just about everyone who has reviewed this album, I first heard of them after finishing Max Payne 2. Usually, upon completeing a game, I try to see if there is a way to skip through the credits, but not this time. For once, I actually couldn't help but pay attention to them. Not because i cared who had made the game, though to them I was quite appreciative, but because of the haunting melody accompanying the end credits....Finally, I managed to find out who made the song, and I eventually purchased their album off a Finnish website. I have consistently enjoyed the album upon my receiving of it, and most everyone else I have played it for has become captivated by their music. Despite the seemingly exorbitant cost, I have rarely enjoyed a cd more, and I highly recommend that those of you reading these reviews go out and purchase the cd, regardless of its cost."
5,Outstanding,"I have been waiting for this group to come out with a cd for a long time ever since I first heard ""Late Goodbye"" on Max Payne 2. I recieved this cd a month ago and I am still listening to it. There is not a single song I don't enjoy and the music just gives you a good feeling. The band is not well known in America and I am trying to spread the word as much as possible. This is definitely a disk to buy."
4,POTF Rocks!,"Like almost everyone else, I first ""Late Goodby"" from Max Payne 2. It was one of the most compelling songs I have ever heard; I could not stop listening to it! I think that is the word that best describes this album: compelling. I really enjoy listening to it. The vocals are strong and the guitar work is excellent. No, it's not perfect, there are some weak points in a couple of the ballads and some repitition in style on a couple of numbers (I found some melodic similarities between Overboard and Seek You Out) but it can be forgiven in the overall scheme of things. A friend of mine compared them to some early work by Caroline's Spine but I enjoy POTF much more. Anyway, buy your copy now! Once these guys get some airplay here in the states, everyone is going to be wanting ""Signs of Life""."
5,It gets better and better every time I listen to it,"I've heard about POTF after hearing Late Goodbye on Max Payne 2 credits, and feeling amazed by this music. So I started to look for the band and after some research I was in their website, I got all their singles, including this one, and waited for their debut album.Boy, it's one of the finest things I've listened in pop rock for all my life. The songs are amazing, the feeling is deep, the lyrics are somewhat poetic. And the album is an import. It's a shame that other record companies are not interested in release this work in their own countries. When the music market will grow up and wake up for the real music?Songs like ""Lift"", ""Overboard"", ""Late Goodbye"", ""3 AM"", ""Illusion and Dream"" are already part of my classic rock discography, this album was born being a classic.If you want to get some new and good rock music today, I strongly suggest that you consider giving these guys a chance."
1,don't be suprised!,"the movei description posted by amazon is not for the movie & cast shown. the movie and cast of Knockout is an edited xxx adult film about boxing.In the xxx world, Stephanie Swift and Brad Armstrong do a better than average job acting. If you're comparing it to rocky, you'll be disappointed.Also, with the hardcore scenes edited for general release this film loses some continuity.Buyer beware: as a xxx feature it's better than average, as an r rated feature it leaves a lot to be desired."

5,If you are a Packers fan-for sure.,"Unfortunalty, I'm a Vikings fan. Bought this for a Vikes vs Pack preparty and got good review as background entertainment."
5,Very persuasive work,"I am a graduate of a solidly Dispensational Bible college. It was this book that changed my thinking. I highly recommend it.It is easy to criticize, because the book is geared toward old line Dispensationalism, the type that is not commonly held by many modern Dispensationalists. I recognize that that is true. There were certain parts of the book that didn't apply much to what I had been taught, aspects of my beliefs that had already been more in line with what Gerstner taught than what he was refuting.Never the less, there was enough relevant information in the book that it really got me to thinking about what I had always been taught and accepted as the truth. I looked more carefully, comparing what I believed to the Bible, and came away with Reformed doctrine when my study was through.I highly recommend it to any Dispensationalist who is willing to analyze what he believes, testing it with the time honored truths of God's Word. You will be glad you did it."
4,Excellent book that disects radical dispensationalism,"Great Job! Really made me examine my dispensationaal beliefs - has helped steer me ever closer to the covenantalists. However, Gerstner seems to want to paint all dispensationalists with the same broad brush. There is a vast difference, for example, between MacArthur and Saucy on the one hand, and Chafer, Ryrie, and Hodges on the other."
5,Work fine,Our 15 year old beagle has failing kidneys and we give her subcutaneous fluids every night using this IV tube. Easy to use and never failed yet. Price is right.
4,David Hawkes. Ok,"Not too much to say. Dream is amazing and I'll leave my commentary on the actual novel itself there. David Hawkes did a good job, but his translation is lacking in many ways. Dream is full of puns and other language/character specific nuances. Much of the deep irony and symbolism is lost in limp and at times flippant name translations and confusing reproductions of titles that can easily leave the reader scratching their head. His choice to translate from a combination of texts provides perhaps too many opportunities for translating to become editing and revision. Still a good buy if you have no investment in Dream as anything but a cool novel someone told you about, but for those seeking a closer reading, it would be best to at least have a Chinese version at hand for comparison."
3,"Expensive, Mediocre, Shadow Of Former Days EP","Like most EPs this CD has a couple of stand out tracks with some filler. I'm not saying this is a bad CD but the value for the price isn't so good, it's expensive and I only thoroughly enjoyed two tracks ""Into The Light"", and ""Vicarage Road"". Even there Amazon allows you to download the first track as an MP3. I suggest downloading it and counting yourself lucky.The Cause & Effect sound has progressed but I'd suggest seeing if you can borrow this from a friend or check it out from the library before buying. I would have preferred to spend the money I used here on something else."
2,"I love Cause & Effect, but....","I am a fan of Cause & Effect. The Sunrise cd is very disappointing, in my opinion. I do like the songs Stay and Vicarage Road. Other than that the cd is not that great. The song Into the Light Is awful. It sounds like they wanted do go disco or something on that one. It reminds me of a bad Pet Shop Boys song or one of Depeche Mode's latest [songs] from their last album! I give the Sunrise cd a 2 out of 5."
2,CAUSE AND EFFECT IS SELLING OUT!!!,"What happened guys? I loved your first 3 CDs! This one has only 5 songs and they are pretty mediocre. ""Innermost Station"" was a great CD so I expected more this time. The music is pretty bad on this CD and there are too many remixes to remind you of that. You should not be able to produce a CD with only 5 songs and charge so damm much for it either! The good news is Camouflage's new CD ""Sensor"" is AWESOME so buy that instead. Iris ""Connect"" is also another band that sounds like Cause and Effect used to before this pathetic CD. Yes, I am sounding bitter. I hope this CD is not going to reflect your future music or else this C&A fan will also move on like most Depeche Mode fans from their last 2 albums."
2,Old Rehashed NFL Films Footage.,I bought this hoping it would really go into detail about each of the 5 49er Superbowls but they really did not get into the the games that much. They just showed highlights of what happened in the season of the year they went to the Superbowls and just highlights of the game itself. There is special features of some players like Young and Rice but they are just interviews from 1999 and 1996 that originally aired on ESPN years ago. Nothing new is on here just old NFL Films shows that they made for ESPN. Very disappointed. They most definitely could have gone into more detail on each game. Terrible.
3,Not real hilights of 49ers years,I bought this hoping that I would get to see highlights of each of the five years the 49ers won the super bowl instead they showed highlights of other teams seasons and not the 49ers like I wanted. It was just a general over view of each season and even had segaments talking about other teams and not the 49ers. I did think that the highlights of the super bowls were very good and even the interviews of some of the players were very good.
2,Could be better,"This DVD was underimpressive. It recounted the regular seasons of teams that didn't make the playoffs but not for the 49ers. The coverage for the 1981 season and playoffs was especially lackluster. The only real decent part of the DVD was the coverage of the actual superbowls. That part was in depth. Also, the cover blurb is a bit misleading in that I thought there was going to be actual game footage with announcers and everything. All it had was highlights and a narrator."
1,The Drop,"I bought this collection expecting to see season and championship highlights of the FORTY NINERS, not other teams. None of the season highlights have been about San Francisco. The team was only included in the Super Bowl highlights, which was minimal. I am not at all impressed with a collection that should focus solely on the Forty Niners and their road to five Super Bowl victories, but barely has any actual highlights of them. I would not waste your money... you could see the same Super Bowl highlights on Hulu."
1,Waste of money. Terrible!,"This is the worst compilation I have ever seen, besides the fact that the Niners won 5 Superbowls. There are more highlights of other teams than the Niners. What happens to all the Niners' highlights? You would think they would include highlights of each of their season leading up to the Superbowl.Pro: You cannot change history. The Niners went to five and won all five Superbowls.Cons: Poor picture quality (like it came from the 70's), confusing highlights back and forth of other teams, poor narrating. Just a very poor compilation without proper transition and cohesiveness.You should skip this and spend $24 and buy ""America Game Superbowl Champions - Forty Niners"". You will enjoy that series a lot more. Nothing but Niners highlights, superb picture quality, and narrated by ex-players themselves with their actual stories and experience with each of their Superbowl season.4ever 9ers Faithful."
5,What the doctor ordered,"My doctor suggested a number of different supplements to help stabilize my blood sugar swings. After shopping around I chose this product. Not only has this stopped the wide blood sugar peeks and valleys, it has also lowered my fasting level about 20 pts!"
4,Excellent Product,With the proper diet. This product works wonders. It has brought down my blood sugar level down by about 20%. My wife and I are very happy w the resuls
3,This is NOT the IMAX film!,"I was disappointed to find that this is not the actual IMAX film transferred to DVD. Instead, it is a documentary ABOUT the IMAX film. It does indeed show some impressive footage from the original, but it was frustratingly interrupted by interviews with the director and shots of the camera crew. The disc does NOT provide the ""sit-back-and-relax"" experience of awesome visuals and cool music that I was expecting, as the constant voice-overs and back-and-forth switches between the beach and the studio do become annoying. It seems redundant for the disc to have a ""making of"" section, as the whole disc is just that. On the bright side, there is some great footage on sports that you don't easily find on DVD (or anywhere else, for that matter). I'd recommend buying it, but caveat emptor!"
2,"be aware, this is not the imax movie!","This is not the imax movie. It is just the ""making of"" of halfof it. Boring...2/3 of the DVD is just the director talking about the imax camera."
2,"It is not good,","I owned mighty beanz before and I liked them.But Mighty Beanz series 3?A big joke.People,All they are is just beanz that flop.These beanz are vilont too.There is a bean that has blood on it.Oh yes,you know series 1?Well,They copied them from officer bean to cop bean.They did more than just that,they copied other beanz from other series!But,I must say that they are quite durable.I threw a bean on concrete and it didn't break.And you get boring 2 cards in each pack.overall,I don't like this series.And besides,all series are the same.I am 9,and I do not recomend this toy to ANYBODY."
5,Bells On Your Toes,"Roy Orbison's second album for Monument was recorded in 1961-2. ""Crying"" has Orbison's classic melodic build that expands to that glorious chorus ""Yes, now you're gone, and from this moment on I'll be crying."" Orbison's sound was a template for the band Jay & the Americans that hit the charts a few years later with ""Cara Mia."" Other tracks like the classic ""The Great Pretender"" and ""Love Hurts"" intrigue with Orbison's treatment. ""Wedding Day"" is a weeper with Orbison's tear-in-your beer sadness. I enjoy hearing Roy rock out on the toe-tapper ""Dance,"" ""Put rings on your fingers, bells on your toes, get with the feeling body & soul."" He does a rock n' roll cha-cha with ""Night Life."" The original album ends with the monster hit ""Running Scared"" that builds dramatically to a thrilling crescendo. The bonus tracks are welcome additions to this great album that is getting close to 50 years old! The sound dynamics on this re-release are excellent. Enjoy!"
5,A nice toner that does not dry out the skin,"This toner is perfect for the Florida climate. It does not dry out my skin, and is light. I actually use it as moisturizer as well many days."
2,It's a video lecture,"For a budding herbalist, this is a good video for initial information and current medicinal opinions in the natural healing community. The author is interviewed and gives his opinions and ideas, but there is no instruction or guides for making your own healing herbal concoctions. If you are just starting out, it is worth seeing but becomes tedious after a while and the video is rather primative in production. Still, good information on the holistic point of view, but nothing else."
5,"No fluff, to the point, Biblical truths that you can use","This is a great book. If you are serious about having a strong, victorious Christian walk, get this. It contains strong, challenging, Biblical truths and insights and teaches you how to apply them. I would recomend this for any Bible study. It has questions at the end of each chapter that help you retain and examine the material. Mr. Kenyon doesn't beat around the bush. Warning! If you are a spiritual wimp and refuse to change, or are to scared to, don't read this book. You might find out why you aren't bearing any fruit in your life and need therapy or something. If you are willing to change, and act on what you read in this book, it will be one of the greatest tools you can have in developing a strong foundation of who you are in Christ."
4,What is the receiver's model number?,This looks like a great buy but I'd like to know which receiver comes with this setup. Does anyone know the actual model number of the receiver? I can't find it on this page or even on Pioneer's page for this setup. The only number I see is HTP-2900 which is the number for the combination.
4,Pretty darn good,"This was my first surround sound purchase, so I can only compare to TV speaker sound. Anyway, it sounds great, I never realized how much 5.1 can draw you into a movie or game. It has 3 digital inputs (which I found rare for this price range)1 fiber and 2 coax. I can crank it up loud enough to be almost uncomfortable with no distortion. Bass is real nice. Also, it has a radio tuner which I liked.2 minor issues: The receiver is huge, alot bigger than it looked in the pictures in my opinion. Second, the documentation is lacking. Looking at the remote there are a whole bunch of features and options this thing has that aren't explained well or even mentioned in the manual.All in all, a great purchase, considering this is one of the cheapest home theaters in a box you can get. I would definetley buy Pioneer again."
5,Outstanding Picture and Sound,"I've had this TV for almost 8 months and am as happy with it as I was the day it was set up. The picture is wonderful and the sound very pleasing. There is no pixelating from fast image movement. The frame is brushed metal and narrow enough that the set doesn't stick out. Very beautiful. I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this TV again.My only regret is that I didn't buy the 46"" which in retrospect would have fit the room well."
5,Sony LCD TV,"The unit is all it's claimed to be. It was delivered to my home and was very easy to unpack. I removed the base (very easy) and mounted it to a wall using an articulating arm. Hook up to cable was easy as was connection to my digital camera for slide shows. Images are clear and sharp both monochrome and color. I'm sure it's reproducing all that the video sources are capable of. Sound is good, although at my age I can't be too critical - I can appreciate the stereo effects. Sporting events like the NFL and pro baseball are especially good. I'm very pleased with the display and expect I'll never need to buy another in my lifetime."
1,Wonderful until the backilghts went out after 2 years,"Seriously, this was a wonderful tv but it didn't last.After 2 years one of the fluorescent backlights has a flickering problem.Sony has basically said that I will have to pay almost half of my original purchase.There has been a grand drop in quality over at Sony. Pretty much every piece of electronics I have purchased from then in the last 3 years had been poorly designed and overly expensive. I used to justify it because my previous Sony purchases lasted forever. This is just not true anymore. I have been a loyal Sony customer for the past decade. No more."
3,poor viewing angle,"I bought this tv about 3 days ago, and it is going back. The picture from 85 to 95 degrees is terrific, blacks levels are great. But then when I moved out side of this ideal viewing angle, the contrast and color saturation dropped swiftly and considerably. Unless you want to subject your friends and family who are not in the 'pole position' viewing spot to watch a washed-out, sub-par picture, you will not buy this tv. If it will be only you watching the tv, from dead-on center, then get it."
5,Sony 40 inch LCD TV,"Having a family room with one complete wall of windows, I was never able to watch a TV against the opposite wall. This Sony 40W3000 has a non reflective coating that has minimized relection and glare beyond anyone's expectations. If you're having similiar problems, I recommend you try this 40 inch or the 46 inch version (46W3000) for an exceptional HDTV picture beyond comparison."
1,I Never Received My Order...,"I ordered and paid for an art poster print on August 5 from ""Generic"". It is September 6 and I still have not received my poster. I ordered two other posters at the same time from ""Poster Revolution"" and received those two on August 14. I have not received an e-mail or any form of communication regarding the whereabouts of my poster. They did however take my money for it... I won't be shopping at ""Generic"" again and would never recommend them to friends, acquaintances or strangers... Definitely go with ""Poster Revolution"", they are reliable and quick."
1,Slips off my nose too easily,"This nose clip slips off very easily when wet. The latex, or rubber, that other brands use stays on much better than the silicon pads in this design. I would not recommend it unless you don't plan to use it in the water (but then what's the point?)"
1,crap,This nose clip will not stay on. I freestyle swim 3 days a week and i have not been able to get it to stay on for more than 10 meters in the pool. Oftentimes it will come off as soon as i let go of it. Dont waste your money.
3,"Pretty, but not as strong as Speedo","***I'm not a swimmer, but I got this nose clip to keep the air out of my nose so that I don't taste the oil I drink on a special diet I am on. I need to have a very tight seal or I will be able to taste the oil. I have experimented with several kinds of nose clips, and this one is very attractive (as nose clips go), but not strong enough---I can breathe through it almost no matter what way I adjust it---and then it will slip! I thought it would be more comfortable than the old-fashioned looking Speedo, but I can't tell a difference. Effectiveness and strength are most important to me so I couldn't use it.If you need a light seal and don't mind some leakage, this is a pretty nose clip, and would work for you. Otherwise, I'd go with the old-fashioned Speedo.***"
3,keeps water out.,"keeps water out of nose; however, it is not comfortable. my son also said that it was too tight for him"
5,Works well,Does exactly what it's supposed to do. I have a reasonably oily skin... and they still didnt slip a bit off my nose.
3,as expected,purchased for my daughter. She hasn't used it yet but the item was what I expected. It was delivered on time and in good condition. If it works well I hope to be able to order additional clips in other colors.
3,A glimpse into Krolls way of thinking,"Some sort of anecdotal book, describing the - rather bold and overall very profitable - commodity trades in a strong and volatile period. I would compare its content to the Livermore or Darvas stories (Darvas being a bit more useful because he developed AND explained his strategy). Krolls strategy is to go with the major trend and buy more on huge (for my taste) 50+% dips assuming that the market will continue its prior trend and then hold the position.A quick read but no must have in my opinion."
2,Boring and dated,"I agree with the last reviewer who said this is a ""sleeper"" but for very different reasons. I had to force myself to read through this, hoping that something unique would emerge, but it never happened. Everything in it is dated, but it doesn't have the charm of say Darvas's books. There's no ""bad"" advice here, but little good advice after determine the trend, wait for a reaction, buy or sell and hold on. Worst of all, the book literally fell apart in my hands with pages coming out of the binding (and this was a new copy) so I can't even sell this dog."
4,Golf's never been so interesting,"Boy or girl, young or old, readers will love reading about Tiger Woods' inspiring rise to the top of the golf world. Overcoming racism, economic hardship, and personal limitations, Tiger leads the pack at an incredibly young age. My 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter and I read this together, and we were all equally enthralled and inspired by Tiger's story. It was accessible without being overly simple. We're looking forward to reading more entries in Matt Christopher's biography series."
2,Networking for College Grads,"If you are just out of College, get this book otherwise forget it! Executive level positions need much more sophisticated book to be successful."
3,Good for beginners,Everything in here is good for the college grad. If you've done any networking before then you are past this book.
5,A MUST READ for Suzuki learners,"This book is essential reading for those who would like to teach their young child to play violin using the Suzuki Method. I was skeptical having assisted my own son with practicing his violin from age 4 - 18. He plays beautifully now but it would have been EASIER for both of us had I read this book when he first began Suzuki violin. In life we rarely get ""do overs"" but I got a chance to read the book so that my granddaughter could take the Suzuki class at Delta College Kids College and what a difference it makes. Plus it is an interesting read just for history's sake. Get it!"
5,Life Changing Book,"This book revolutionized my life. I visited a Suzuki flute instructor and fell in love with this method. I saw how excited the children were about learning and how much joy they had. When I read the book I understood why. Dr. Suzuki has a mastery over how children respond to love and encouragement. Reading the stories in here about patience, love and encouragement changed the way I taught flute and also the way I approach life in general. I now try to emulate Dr. Suzuki's teachings in all my interactions. I would recommend this book to every music instructor, whether Suzuki or traditional, every teacher, every parent, and any person who works with or has contact with children. I bought this copy to give to a former student, to help him remember his roots as he begins his music career. I hope he will choose to emulate Dr. Suzuki's love and wisdom in his teaching."
2,Not impressed........,Not impressed........I donated to my local library not anything special. I would not recommend just so so!~ I actually find Native American flute music to relax me the best. every one is different you might like it. Just not for me!~
3,Just ok...,"You get what you pay for. They serve their purpose...but are not that attractive, in my opinion. They are not extremely comfortable, but they do not cause pain. I would say they are worth the money."
2,"cute, comfy on the soles, but...","I like the sandals overall, but the straps kind of rub the insides of my ankles, so after awhile, I have to take them off. Too bad...no long walks in these. Glad I didn't wear them to Cedar Point...."
3,No coats of arms !,"Has some limited information - but no coats of arms! Found nothing on my families, but you might want to take a chance."
4,Relative Strangers,Another very good book. I have become spoiled from reading regular books now that I have the Kindle e books
2,Hated it.,I bought this book based on all the reviews. I was really looking forward to it but as the body count started to rise I lost interest. I could understand the first one and maybe the second but surely that was enough to determine we were dealing with a realy bad guy. The ending just wasn't satisfying enough to have put up with the lost of close friends.
4,This kept me up way too late one night!,"For a first-time novelist, Joyce Lamb has a fantastically strong understanding of plot -- this book surprised me more than once. As a writer, I also know writing sex scenes is a difficult thing to pull off, but Lamb does it with good taste and nice ""heat."""
2,Relative Strangers,I don't even remember this book. Probably it was one in which I couldn't retrieve on my Kindle. If I did read it it didn't stay in my memory.
4,Relative Strangers,Enjoyed the storyline and the main characters are definitely made for each other. Would enjoy a follow-up on NIck and Margo.
2,"Better than the first one, but....","This is the second book about a group of four best friends who go their separate ways for a summer, keeping in touch through writing and passing along a shared pair of jeans.The characters in this story were likable. I enjoyed reading the story from the various points of view. I liked the ways the four girls supported each other through hard times.However, I found much of the story to be utterly predictable. From the moment I started reading, I could tell exactly how Tibby's experience at the summer program and her adoration for the ""cool"" kids would turn out. I also knew what would happen when Bee tracked down her grandmother. Carmen's mother's relationship followed an equally predictable arc.Although the characters were good, I found the story lines too dull to really sustain my interest."
4,The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,I really enjoyed reading this book.I liked the surprises in the book.Some of them weren't good surprises but thats just part of the book.Before you read this book you'll want to read the first book witch is The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants.Like in the first book it mentions Bailey and Brian.I really like the way the book ended.I recomend this book to girls 12 and up who like this kind of book.
3,A decent sequel,"I give the first book five stars, but this one doesn't quite live up to the standard the other one set. It ties up loose ends, which is nice, but doesn't maintain the independence each girl had before. Sure, their voices and stories are different, but it's the same pattern for all four of them, just with different events.This book focuses on the relationships that each girl has with her mother (or in Bee's case, grandmother). That was just a little too cookie-cutter for me.It's still a great book, and next to other books, rates much higher than three stars. This rating is only next to the first book."
5,Doesn't Disappoint,"This book is as good and better than the first one. AFter finishing the first book, I could not wait to find out what happened next to the girls. The second book picked up right where the first one left off with new and exciting adventures for all four girls. It was a laugh-out-loud and cry-ou-loud book. It brought me laughs and tears which is always the best kind of book. It was filled with twists and turns that kept me guessing. This book definately earns five stars and I recommend it to anyone who read and enjoyed the first one. These girls just beg for people to read their lives."
4,Great Book,I thought this was a great book. Not as good as the last book but it definatly had its good points. You can totally get into the story and you feel like you are really there with the girls and feel all of their pain and joy. I reccomend this book to all of you who loved the first summer of the sisterhood and you wont be dissapointed!!have fun reading it!
5,SUPER DOOPER GOOD!,OMG! Anybody who is anybody would definitely love this book. It is so awesome! I seriously could not put it down. It is way way way better then the first! I love it so much! Guess what everyone?! Ann is making a THIRD BOOK! It's about when they all go to college and solve their problems from the 2nd book. I can't wait!!! yeahhhh I'm gonna explode! This book is too good. GO BUY IT NOW! But read the 1st one or else you be lost!!!
4,The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,"Ever since i finished reading The first book, I had been hoping that a sequal would come out because I loved the first book and I was anxious to see what happens next in the lives of Carmen, Tibby, Lena, and Bee. I would definately say that this is a good book, i couldn't put it down because I couldn't wait to see how everything worked out. It wasn't, however, as good as the first book, and the ending was a little bit depressing. I would definately recomend it to anybody who liked the first book. Just as a word of advice, don't start it until you have plenty of free time to finish it or else you will spend all of the time when you aren't reading it thinking about how it will all play out. i hope that my review was helpful to everyone who reads it."
5,One of the BEST!,"I enjoyed reading this book so much! I really related to the characters and their interactions and experiences together. Being 16, myself, I have many of the same thoughts and feelings as the rest of the characters. This is one of those books that you never want to put down. I could not take my eyes off it for a minute, my mother even had to ask me to turn off the light and go to bed one night! (Enough about me...) If you are questioning whether to read, or buy, this book, it is a definite yes. I loved the first so much that I ordered it and the Second summer of the Sisterhood and I really look forward to reading them both again! I hope this review has helped!"
4,The second summer of the sisterhood,"This book was one of the best books I have read. In the 6th grade I read the first book for a book report. After that book the other books just didn't sparkle anymore till till this book. I have fallen in love with the sisterhood and am now reading the third book, I just can't put it down. But my advice for u is to after youu read this review, stop what you are doing and go get a copy and read this marvolous book."
4,The Sisters of Summer,This a wonderful book! It's even better than the first. The characters are fun and interesting to read about. The stories in this book are themes that we can all relate too. It's the perfect summer story. Read it today!
4,The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,"After reading the first in this series, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, I had to read the second book. This is a fun and addictive series. The books are quick, light reads.This second book in the series was great. I like how the story continued, the storyline was very emotional. It was hard to put down, and I found myself tearing up at parts, then laughing out loud at other parts. I will be reading book 3!"
4,its a good sequel,"this is a great sequel to the sisterhood of the traveling pants. i like ""Bee"" better in this one. its really good and if you read the first one then you have to read this one."
2,Written by a teacher,"This is an okay book, but read it first before passing to you elementary age children. The writing is easy enough that a 4th or 5th grader could read it, but the themes are too mature for that age range."
3,A fun sequel,"A fun, not too fluffy, summer read, The Second Summer continues the life and times of four close friends and their families. Brashares makes her characters real and does not sugar coat issues in standard young adult fiction drivel which creates a good read for teens and adults. The Second Summer's downfall is its inability to stand on its own. If you have not read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, you will most likley have difficulty understanding what is going on - because most of the plot it is based on things that came before. So pick up BOTH Traveling Pants books and settle in for an adventurous summer!"
2,Disappointing. . .,"The author certainly knows how to write a good story, but I wouldn't recommend this book for teenagers, especially younger teenagers. Since when are graphic descriptions of makeout sessions acceptable? These girls are still in high school. Maybe I'm just over sensitive, but I am disappointed by authors who use blatant sex, or foreplay, in literature. Without that element in this book I would give it five stars, as the book was truly enjoyable to read otherwise."
3,Nice sequel,"This was a nice sequel to the original Pants novel. I wouldn't give it any awards, but it was a decent, breezy read that I finished in a day, just like the first one.The reader learns a little bit more about the girls, and the girls learn a little bit more about themselves as they weather life's ups and downs.My heart really went out to Lena this time. The first book painted her as a very aloof, distant type, but in love she lets herself open up some, and she seems more human this time around.There is still an element of disbelief that I had to suspend - for example, Bridget takes off for Alabama and doesn't tell anyone she's going or coming, and masquerades as someone else to her grandmother. Highly unrealistic, but there's a fair amount of unrealistic when it comes to a book that in the center of the plot is a pair of what has to be a completely filthy (!) pair of magic pants.Despite its flaws, it's still a fairly enjoyable read for its genre."
3,Nice read,"It's a great book that shows the difficulty that each person goes through. Friendship, love, jealous, feelings of not belonging are subject you can find in this book. Great for teenagers."
2,Meh,"Ugh. I loved the first book but by the time I read the paragraph about Carmen's date with something about how she wouldn't like him ordering something ""girly"" seriously? I didn't think Ann Bashares was that sexist. Already putting it down. Don't need anymore preaching about gender than there already is In this world. Disappointed."
3,Not as good as the first...,"Slightly less compelling than the first volume, but still good, Kind of a bridge from the first to the third. Bridget's visit to her grandmother was the most engaging storyline."
5,The Second Summer of the Sisterhood,"Just as good as the first, if not better. A wonderful sequel for anyone who loves the first one."
3,The sisterhood,"The 1st book, The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is onew of my favorite books ever, i thought that this one was very good, but not as good. But a few things upset me about it. When Lena and Kostos got back together and had a very romantic relationship, i was so happy, and i couldn't wait to read more about her. But i don't like how it turned out for them and i don't really like the end of the book. It made me cry a lot and it made me very unhappy."
2,Not Exactly A Classic,"This story was good for the most part. It was dissapointing in regards to the Lena love life, and Carmen refuses to learn from her mistakes, an essential element to all human life tht Ann Brashares can't seem to comprehend very well, and Libby's character continues to annoy and seem dead and life-less. It does contain a very good Bridget story that I loved, particularly because Bridget seemed to be the only character with actual depth. Buy this if you really want to continue in the adventures, but otherwise, it's not necessary to your survival."
4,a great read,"this was a good sequel to the sisterhood of the traveling pants.. Tibby is off to film school which is pretty interesting. Carmen stays home and gets in a huge fight with her mom about her new boyfriend.. she is my least fav. character. Bridget goes to her grandmoms to find herself and gets back into soccer, meets an old friend but doesnt tell anyone who she is till later. And lena.. has broken up with kostos because of distance but he comes to visit and they have a hot romance.. BUT you wont BELIEVE what is in their way.. personally i really liked kostos and their romance and i didnt like how lenas story ended :-(.. but all in all it is a good book.. however make sure you read the first one before you read this.(...)"
1,MOST BORING BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!,"I read this book for a book report and couldn't finish it, it was sooooooooooooooo bad. I mean all it was was 4 girls who send letters. and the stupid pants it was soooo bad it was almost shreaded and then burned and then flushed down the toilet but then i realized i could give it to charity so i will. I HATE THAT BOOK. PS i started the best book and finished it in 2 days for the report and did the report in 3 days because it was so inseperable from me.the book was PRINCESS IN THE SPOTLIGHT. BY MEG CABOT. CABOT RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,An Awesome Book!!,"I read this book and I was like, wow, this is sooooo awesome!! I liked it a ton. It's about four girls named Lena, Bridget, Tibby, and Carmen who share a pair of magical pants every summer. Through the Traveling Pants they find love, happiness, and a feeling like ""maybe I do belong."" The girls are truly inspiring characters that make you feel enlightened and happy. I reccomend it for 7th grade and up. There are a couple swear words, but nothing serious. I definetly would give this book TEN stars if it were possible!!!!!!Read it!!!!!!!!!!! ;-)"
4,This isn't just for young adults!,"I picked this book up during a very difficult time in my life, right after my Mother died. It attracted me because it was about Mothers and Daughters, and I was missing mine and needed a hidey-hole to forget about my present circumstances--motherless! Although I did not read the first book, I would recommend this book to every girl who has a mother and every mother who has a daughter. There's a lot of life, love, misery, and joy between these pages and the traveling pants, while seemingly nonsensical, made this book a delight! Take a chance, read the book, regardless of your age or gender. I think you'll find you've made a wise decision and the tugs on your heartstrings will help you remember that you're still alive, even if, like some of us, the most important person in the world is no longer available to share it with you! Thanks Ann Brashares for making my life more bearable at an awful time!"
5,A sweet taste of Now and Then,"I loved this book series and if you loved the first book you'll most definetly enjoy this one as well. These books give a new meaning to love and friendship, they show you that even the strongest friendships and relationships hit rocky points. In my opinion i think this series should be made into movies. It'd be like a new school version of the movie ""Now and Then"". I dunno about anyone else but I'd sure go and see it."
4,Great Read,"I had to pick up this book after reading the first in the series! I have to admit I liked the first one a little bit better. The girls are growing up and I enjoyed the adventures they had this year. I just thought that the first book was a little more interesting. I would love to read the next in the series that will come out in January! I think the book was great, but I wish there was additional explanation on some parts of the book."
5,You dont know how much i loved this book!,"This book was so amazing. It is just overflowing with emotions that made me feel like i was a part of these four girls' lives. All i can say, if you are a teen girl who hasn't read this book, READ IT NOW, and p.s.- go hug your mom."
5,the second summer,"Ann Brashares has definitely grown up between writing The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants and The Second Summer of the Sisterhood. Her sequel is more melancholy and its plot lines are more developed -- by saying this, I am not criticizing the first book because I absolutely loved that one. But this book is absolutely amazing too, a good followup.The first book focuses on introducing the four girls Carmen, Tibby, Lena and Bridget, on each one's journey of finding themselves, without the help of each other, stabilizing their friendship. The second book focuses on the four girls and their relationship with their mothers, dealing with issues and ghosts from the pasts. Whilst the first book is lighter, the second book is sadder and more melancholy. I recommend both books."
5,Just as Good:),"After I read 'the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants' I didn't think any book could be as good, including the sequel. Was I ever wrong! This one was just as good, maybe better. It had more emotion, maybe a few less laughs. All of the charectars seem even more real to me, especially Tibby who was not as good last book. If you've read 'the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants', you have to read this book. You HAVE to."
2,A Letdown,"After the fantastic first appearance of this book, (The first summer of the sisterhood) this book was a bit of a letdown. The only character really interesting to read about was Bridget, and some of the action between Kostos and Lena is a little too mature for the young teen. I reccomend the first of the books, but the others are not nearly as good."
5,Great book!,This was a really awesome book. I didn't like it as much as the first one though. I didn't find Tibby to be very interesting in this book or the last one. Briget was my favorite both times because I never know what is coming next with her. I really did enjoy the book though.
2,Disappointing,"After falling in love with the first book, I was anxiously awaiting the release of the second book. After waiting patiently, I was filled with zeal when I saw the second book on the shelf at the book store. I bought it and read it all through, and quite frankly, all i have to say is that this book sucks. Not only is this book unrealistic, virtually no one can relate to it or the situations that the characters find themselves embellished in. The only story which I found semi-interesting was Bridget's, since it actually had some moral values. Lena's story is so crazy. It is as if Kostos is the only reason she is alive, and that if she doesn't see him at least once a day, she'll curl up and disintegrate. The first book is the only one worth reading in this series."
5,Awesome Series!,I am enjoying the Sisterhood of Traveling Pants series tremendously! Where is the third book in paperback?
4,THE SECOND SUMMER OF SISTERHOOD,"Ann Brashare has done it again! This wonderful book is about four young girls that are all connected by a pair of magic pants.Each summer the girls set out for different adventure. This book contains romance,truth,family,and death all together in a heart-warming story. I really liked this book and I hope you do to!"
5,second one as good as the last,"this second installment is as good as, if not better then the last. from the very beginning of the book you feel drawn into the characters lives. the transition from one narrator to the next is smooth. Ann Brashares deals with events in a way that makes you identify with the character(s), and want her to feel like herself again. there is no glossing over of the fact that it takes a long time for emotional scars to heal. the quotes scattered throughout the book, as always, are a wonderful addition to the book and tie together all the parts of the story."
5,AMAZING...,"I first read The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, and I absolutely loved it. Now that book was just...spectacular! The second book, The Second Summer of the Sisterhood was amazing, but not quite as good as the first book-but is definitely worth the read. When I started the book, it seemed that it would be worse than the first book, but the plots that each of the characters were in were really interesting. Hope this helps, and remember-read the book!"
5,One of the Best Books I've read,The Second Summer of the Sisterhood was a great runner up to the first book. Even if the first book was a little better this book still deserves 5 stars. The relationships that the 4 girls have seem to grow over the second summer through all of their troubles and adventures. If you liked the first book you'll love this one!
4,"Not as good as the first, but a nice mother-daughter book","As I said above, I liked the first book better but the characters became even more human in this second installment! We get to see Carmen have yet another parental crisis, Lena lighten up while dealing with her first real love, Bridget finally come to terms with her past and Tibby finally creates a movie she is proud of. Mothers and daughters really play a huge roll in this book.Once again this author is not afraid to address real teen issues. Worth a read!"
5,A Wonderful Book,"This book, i thought, was 100 times better than the first. I must admit, I looked forward to Lena's situations the most. I cannot believe what happened, i was literally bawling my eyes out. I don't think I have ever cried this much reading a book. If you are a hopeless rmantic like me, then you will ADORE Lena's parts in the book."
3,CLOSE BUT NO CIGAR,"I liked this book, but i didn't think it was as good as the first one. Ann Brashares obviously wanted to ge3t more sophisticated and thus filled page after page of Lena's love life. Carmen's segment shows how mean she really is and is also extremely boring. Tibby's is vaguely interesting, Bridget's is very good, and Lena's is good. Read the first before read the second!"
1,Inappropriate,"I read the first book called The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and their were only 2 parts of the book that were nasty. It included hugging and nudity. I thought that maybe the 2nd book would be better, so i read it. I got 2/3 of the way into the book and then their was the nudity again. I hated the book. It is sick."
4,Hope the Second in the series is as good as the first.,"I have not read it yet, but thourally enjoyed the movie and my daughter has read several in the Traveling Pants series. Look forward to reading it soon."
3,Good,"I loved this book, the only thing I did wrong was watch the movie (which was terrible) overall I loved this book"
5,She's done it yet again!,"Another great book to delve into! This one is even better than the first because the girls live tragedy and remember what matters most and to be true to yourself and your morals.I loved this book because they all did their own thing but yet at the end they all came back together and really bonded. Also, the mothers friendships are in this book a bit more which was a nice glimpse!There are too many things going on in this book to mention, but love is found and lost, heartaches are realized as a part of life, but friendships are the foundation and what they come back to!You won't want to miss out on this second book!"
5,The BEST book,"The book is fabulous. It tells a story of a group of four, very diffent girls. The most surprising part of the book is that the four girls are all very different but they are the closest friends that I have ever heard about. Each one of these girls have a very unique personality. Somehow the author made it so that no marrer who is reading this book, they will relate to a character in some way.The Second Summer of the Sisterhood has all the qualities that I love about a book: romantic; exciting; breathtaking; surprising. The list could go on and on. I loved the book because it taught such an important lesson, to always be yourself no matter what you are going through. After reading this amazing book, it totally gave me a burst of self confidence. This book is definitley the best book I have ever read and I am sure it will be yours too if you read this book."
3,Great -- but my first one broke,"This marker has a little plastic insert that the tip clicks into when you close it. On my first marker, the little insert pulled loose soon after I started using the marker. I had no luck gluing it back in. Without the little insert, the cap doesn't go on tightly and the tip dries out. In a triumph of hope over experience, I then bought a two-pack of the same marker. Why? Because if the little plastic insert stays in, the marker is terrific. It doesn't roll off the table; it can make fine lines or broad lines; it's easy to hold. I'm crossing my fingers and hoping my first marker was just a lemon. If it were not for the problem with the little insert, I'd give this marker five stars."
1,Why Can't The Students Do Anything right?,"It seems that Jeremy Silman's students can't do ANYTHING right. No matter what they do, it is wrong. Maybe that says something about Silman as a teacher."
2,I don't see what's all that special here...,"It's ultimately a chess strategy book, pure and simple. Rather than going over grandmaster games, he goes over game segments of himself vs. amateurs. And it's cute and witty and all. But in the long run, this effort seems a bit lacking. Things are presented as discrete rules...with bishops do this, with pawns do that....and gives a ""chess by formula"" feel. You get bits of knowledge, but still don't have a good sensation of being able to 'put it all together'. And that just won't do. Try Beims' Lessons in Chess Strategy instead...you'll get much more of the big picture."
4,Neat Book,"Pretty unique book from the rest of my chess books,IM Jeremy Silman will set up a position which was played in a tourny and ask his students to play the position and think out loud so he can know what area his students need to be corrected on to change the way they think at the same time teaching us readers to learn from his students mistakes."
4,Not Bad At All,"I've found that chess is a tougher game than I had thought, but this book isn't bad at all to inch forward a bit. I have two books by Jeremy Silman; A-Z of Chess Strategy and this one. I find that they both complement each other very well. This book in particular helped me to understand the idea of where to place pawns and why. It also helped me understand the idea of imbalances on the board. Highly recommended but not the only thing a person will need of course."
2,Not how a person thinks in the real world,This book gives you some steps in how to analyze and think. There is a serious problem with this. It is not realistic for a person to use the things that the book suggests - you would be bogged down. A player needs to learn patterns based on some of the ideas given in this book. Silman's other books are better. This book will do little to help you improve your game.
3,Not for advanced players.,"The good news: It's well written and it's a lot of book for not that much money. I read it in three days and that must be a record for me and chess books. Bad news: Reason I read it that fast was I didn't have to stop to think at any point. If you are 1800+, it's unlikely there will be anything in this book you can use. I lent it to a friend of mine who's a complete beginner - never been to a club, and he found it useful. I considered it a waste of money and would like to give it a single star, but evidently weaker players find it useful, so it's just bad luck, I suppose."
2,not for true amateurs,"i bought this book based on reading the reviews. after opening the first page & feeling like a freshman dropped mid semester into the middle of a 400 level college course, i sent it back a couple days later! I literally had no idea about most of what was being discussed. I really can't say if this is a good book or not - if you play a lot of chess & study a lot, it may very well be. If you like to dabble here & there & just want to begin to grasp some better concepts - look elsewhere."
1,"""How to Play Poor Chess""","One star for this book is generous.This book is written on something all intermediate chess players could write about - poor chess playing.My complaint is that the book spends too much time on instructing the reader on poor chess and not enough on proper chess playing.The reader is forced to go through in detail what thought processes (however faulty) each student is using. The reader is treated to having to do this move by move. Why? So Silman can then criticize them, their thoughts, and their moves. Sounds good doesn't it?It's not.I hated this book.And I gave it away mint.It is disappointing since Silman authoured 2 fine books: Reassess Your Chess and the corresponding Workbook. They are well worth having and are much better instructional books to help the intermediate player improve practical play."
5,The Perfect Book For a Narrow Audience,"If your no good, you won't like it. If your too good, you won't like it. If you've been playing chess for at least two years and are struggling to get any better... you will find it absolutely amazing. Chess will begin to make sense. Silman focuses on one topic at a time... He then shows you a problem position. He shows these positions to some of his students of different strenghts and asks them to play against him but to think aloud as they play. He comments on what they are doing poorly and well. He teaches you how to think, not just how to play. At the end of the book there are 24 problem positions for you to tackle. He then provides you with a 3-5 page analysis of what his student did and why. This cements knowledge you learnt in the previous pages. I read this book slowly and meticulously and have improved in a big way. No book I have seen is similar to this one in style and usefulness."
2,A Book About Weak Players' Weak Play,I own 3 books by J. Silman (Reassess Your Chess and the matching workbook in addition to this one). The Ameteur's Mind does not measure up to the other two. The book covers many of the same topics as the other two books but waters it down by having the reader go through many games played by amateurs in an attempt I suppose to help the reader identify with the faulty thought processes of these low level players.Unfortunately this does little to really focus on improving my game. The main problem I found is that too much time is spent on wading through others' mistakes that do not apply to my own game. Much of the material I found irrelevant and the book could be half as long as it is.I suggest buying the other 2 Silman books which are very good and you won't be missing anything by not having this one.
4,A must have,"In my opinion this book is a must for any serious chess player's library, whether you are new to the game or have been playing for years. With this book Silman helps you to understand some of the finer points of the strategy of the game. One of the most common imbalances in the game of chess is Bishop vs. Knight and if that were the only topic covered in this book it would be worth purchasing, but it also covers other imbalances such as Bishop vs. Rook and pawn majorities on opposite wings. Definitely a worthy purchase."
3,Watered Down,This is a watered down version of How To Reasses Your Chess. I read this after reading HTRYC and the workbook. If you have trouble with HTRYC then read Amateur's Mind first. If you already have HTRYC then don't bother getting Amateur's Mind. You will find all the same stuff but not explained as well.It was interesting to see how an amateur thinks but studying mistakes is not the best way to learn chess.

5,Awesome blender!,"I read up on the amazon ratings in order to pick a blender which would work well for me. I am very satisfied w/ the results! The back to basics shp1000 works great. Pulverizes ice in seconds, makes delicious smoothies in about 20-30 seconds. The high power of this unit (1000 watts pulse) makes blending a breeze, and the spout comes in very handy. Clean up is a breeze also, just rinse w/ water, open the spout and let water run through it, and you're done. Like someone said before, it is loud, but that doesn't bother me. I'd rather listen to a loud blender for 20 seconds rather than deal w/ a quiet inefficient blender! two thumbs up"
1,piece-o-junk,"After less than one month of moderate use, the blade assembly broke and the pitcher could no longer hold liquid...to the credit of the manufacturer, they replaced it with a comparable model...interesting note...while I purchased this item new, it was 3 years old and was technically out of warranty...go figure!"
1,Back to Basics SHP1000 Smoothie Professional Smoothie Maker,This blender; while beautiful to look at; died after only a few short uses. I only used the blender 4 times before the motor burned out. Save your money. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. This blender is only good for decorative purposes only
3,They were so so days.,"The movie is incoherent. The acting is stiff, not convincing.There are two touching scenes in the whole DVD. One is where an Algerian soldier stepped on a case of fresh tomatoes and said to his French captain ""If tomatoes are not given to everybody, then nobody will get one"".The second is where another Algerian soldier rushed to a room and tried to carry his wounded French captain away from the house while the Germans were entering it. They ended up being killed by the German anti-tank gun. Had the soldier just run away by himself and left his commander behind, he would have had escaped death.The film is good in term of anti-racism. It is worth renting not buying.Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, the Longest Day, the Lost Battalion, Hamburger Hill, We were Soldiers, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals are still the only titles on my list of Best War Movies of All Times."
5,Great movie,I would give this movie a rating of 6 stars if I could. Based on true story with great acting and drama. Director Debbouze did it again.
3,ARE FROGS SLIMY?,"Similar in title to Kubrick'sPaths of Glory, both excellent films portray the French in two wars as slimeballs.I shouldn't be too harsh on the French, tho... after all, they only deprived their African soldiers of the same benefits given to the French soldiers, instead of flat-out executing them as in Kubrick's World War I film.Are the French any better today or is the slimeball trait in their genetic makeup, making them slimeballs forever? Hmmmm..."
3,Saving Private Ryan... with French North-Africans,"Really, that's all it is. I could go on, but i really don't need to because all it takes is about 10 minutes of film time & you too can predict pretty much every remaining minute of the film. Take a few hard-boiled caricatures, give them a historical time & place in which injustice still burns (bonus points for the politically correct ""Muslims are brave & selfless but Western Whites are gutless oppressors"" theme), then sprinkle with at least a good dozen war movie cliches that even pre-teens have seen a hundred times. Let stand 10 minutes, then serve, while acting like no one has ever seen Saving Private Ryan. Voila!"
2,Righteous Indignation over French Colonialism WWII Era,"This film does not compare to many other WWII efforts.It is primarily a reminder of the overwhelming Liberal Whacko Trend that will continue until democracy is destroyed by Muslim Extremist or Anti-American forces.It's good to understand the truth- that there has been evil in the world as a result of Bigotry & Colonialism, but to whine about it without ceasing is just unacceptable.Grow up!I recommend another war movie other than this one."
5,Great item for history buffs.,good movie for that rain week end. Shows how the French treated their non French soldiers during the war in europe.
3,Easy Read,The book is pretty good. I've read all of her books and this was up to the standard of the others. Fun to read.
2,Forgettable and laughable,"I bought this book to read during work (caregiving involves lots of sitting around) because I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and felt there may be an interesting story behind the rest of the family. Boy was I wrong!The plot was pretty forgettable. I just finished the book today and already can't remember half of what happened in the beginning. The characters, with the exception of Cassandra, were two dimensional. The ""romance"" portion of the book was laughable at times (the two main characters hardly said two words to each other when the fell into each other's arms and proclaimed their love). In fact, a plot beyond ""Downtrodden girl narrowly averts becoming a mistress"" was pretty weak.All in all, there are much better novels to be read out there. Unless you're stuck somewhere with this as your only reading option, I'd opt for something else."
3,Mistake?,"Did anyone else notice that in Ms. Aston's previous book, The Exploits & Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy, Belle is married, but in this book, published after, Belle is not married? I find it irritating when an author makes mistakes like that when they are easily avoidable. Otherwise, I enjoyed this book, but liked her other books better."
2,Looking for a better read?,"Austen-improvisers can keep trying, but I've yet to read anything really worthwhile by any of them. If you enjoyed this story of an independent, talented young woman living in a historically difficult time, I'd recommend just about anything by Judith Merckle Riley. Historical detail and well-drawn, completely original characters put her books at the top of my list of favorites."
4,Excellent Refresher,"I don't know how good this book will be for someone who is not comfortable with proofs, because it takes a somewhat more abstract, less computational and visual approach to the subject. Nevertheless, if you already learned multivariable calculus in a computational/visual style in an early undergraduate class, and now find yourself more comfortable with the abstract approach of higher mathematics, this book will help you re-learn the concepts of multivariable calculus in the proper abstract setting. Everything clicks at reasonable reading speed so you don't need to spend a lot of time stopping to remind yourself of what he's doing. An easy, smooth read that will leave you with a good perspective on the subject. Highly recommended for the right kind of reader."
2,this guy is crazy,"You'll need a complete background to understand this book. There are few practice problems, the ideas are presented with little explanation or connection to traditional lower calculus."
5,"And a restaurant, too","After admitting I haven't tried all the recipes, I have eaten at a new restaurant at Downtown Disney, an Irish Pub, Raglan Road, where it's Chef is Dundon. Shepherds pie was wonderful as was the fish chowder, though it's called 'Not fish chowder"". They were out of the cookcook so I came to Amazon.I can't wait to try more... Nice reworkings of Irish cuisine and a beautiful book, too."
2,Not worth it.,"This book is more akin to (and about the same size) as the old RadioShack ""Engineer's Mini Notebook"" series than a ""handbook"" of any kind. At only 119 pages including table of contents, introduction and index, it's not exactly chock full of information. It does feature large pin-outs and sample circuits of some of the most common ICs, but for the high price asked you could easily buy a proper data book that is far, far more comprehensive. Definitely a disappointment."
1,Kindle Version is a waste,The kindle version is some sort of blind conversion. It has no markers for chapters or navigation other than page by page and text is laid out terribly. I am sure the book itself is great but it is hard to tell when I have only about 4 lines to a page with so much extra space and no good navigation or layout.
3,Narrow Shelves,I was unaware that the shelves did not go all the way to the back board. While this is not a serious problem when the shelves are almost full i have dropped a few dvd's down the back.
5,Well-valued product,"The bookshelves are an excellent value and will serve their function for years to come. The assembly process was not difficult and the packaging was not excessive. We had the shelves installed and filled (and I mean filled) in one afternoon. The only negative aspect to the product was a wrong impression by me of the overall size of the product. But that is not a true problem, as the shelves are more that sufficient for the purpose intended. As it turns out, we may have to get another set of these fine shelves."
1,WARNING wrong weight limit in review,"Amazon says 30-72 pound limit WRONGpackage says ""36 lb load limit""this ""error"" may cause blinds to break and fall on someone."
3,Fun but not prefect,MSG SEED Destiny continues to be an action packed ride but at this point the series has started to go downhillIf you liked SEED you probably still like Destinythe story starts to change as the focus shifts to Kira and company and Durandals goals become clearer.If you like Kira then this may seem a welcome change but be warned as the series continues you will begin to see more of the same from SEED
5,One of my favorites - and I don't much care for vocal music,"Though I'm not a huge fan of vocal music, this is one of my very favorite of over 1,200 CDs in my collection. It's a lovely collection, with no weak spot. Eleanor Steber in the first recording of Knoxville 1915 is magnificent, and I can never listen to anyone else do Copland's Old American Songs after hearing William Warfield's rendition here. The real finds here, though, are the Thomson works: Stabat Mater is brief but haunting and memorable, and Capital Capitals is inventive and hilarious. In this company, the young Leontyne Price in Barber's Hermit Songs is almost beside the point. I cannot recommend this CD highly enough."
4,WHY $39.00-57.00 for a paperback and $118.00 for hardcover?,"Thought provoking read, yet the PRICE? A $118.00 for the hardcover and the paperback costs $39.00-57.00... Outrageous!For $118.00 I would think you'd be able to secure yourself a seat at one of her seminars...My advice...Read the PDF before purchasing.the deliberate dumbing down of america - A Chronological Paper Trail: A Chronological Paper Trail"
2,Paranoia,"It may be sincere, but its effect on many is probably to discredit better and more carefully thought-out criticisms of modern schooling. Read someone like John Taylor Gatto instead, who has much less of a questionable ax to grind."
1,Conspiracy Theorey!,"If you need to have your voice heard, take the path of those who want to be in the spotlight. This book, promoted on Alex Jones and interviewed on his radio show, does not back up the claims of the author and the back-up submitted in the book does not show that there is a deliberate dumbing down of our children. Iserbyt seems to have a grudge against the Dept of Education, but does not back up her claim. There are problems in some local school districts that each family can take action through our PTA, but do not expect a CONSPIRACY FROM THE NEW WORLD ORDER!"
1,Needs to a get editor and take a political science class,"The book is written much like a textbook- fragmented dates and facts without causation, or connecting the dots. She does not research the people that is pointing her finger- otherwise she would realize that John Dewy was in fact AGAINST spilting the high school system into liberal arts and making the masses go into vocational traning. If she had read the School and Society she would see that her complaints about the school system are not the schools that John Dewy visiualized. She completely leaves out Woodrow Wilson ties to the process. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THE BOOK- it will piss you off when you resale it for 5.00!!!!"
3,Who's publishing this stuff?,"Just an observation: I cannot tell from the information offered on this page who the publisher of ""The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America "" is. I would recommend that everyone gain familiarity with a publishing house before jumping into these products. Now is this omission deliberate? It is certainly dumbing. I wonder if Charlotte Thompson Iserbyt would direct her examining intellect toward the software engineering industry and divine a political agenda therein? I would read that book."
3,Great book but digital presentation poor.,"The quality control on the kindle book was ship shod resulting in whole lines missing from the book every five or six pages. Love the book, disappointed in the publishing."
5,MOONDOG'S ACADEMY OF THE AIR AND OTHER DISASTERS,"Great book. Couldn't put it down. A must read !!!Funny if you are a pilot. It might not be for young children, though, due to a few words used however, it is a great book and I highly recommend it."
5,A Must Book Even for Non Pilots,"I have known Pete Fusco for at least fiften years and can assure you that he speaks and acts exactly as the way he comes across in print. He has a very fertile imagination and a mind that must contain a repertoire of at least 1,000 jokes, an one of which he may unleash at any time on an unsuspecting public.This is a tremendous book-a fun book to read and one that I put on a par with Confedracy of Dunces, which won a Pulitzer Prize. Ir is a must book for anyone who desires to look at life through the eyes of someone who sees the lighter side of humanity in whatever he does and is willing to make fun of himself in doing so.Pete, if you are reading this review I want you to know that I didn't die and am very much alive. You keep me that way with your humor. You are one hell of a funny guy."
3,Another Cooking Light?,"I love Italian food and need to watch those calories. However, I did not find these recipes that intriguing to use in lieu of any Cooking Light or Weight Watchers recipes based on Italian cuisine.Barbara"
4,Cook Bood Review,I have small children with bland Minnesota cuisine tastes. I have found some recepies that our whole family would eat. I personally enjoy the cook book but struggle finding many choices for all of us. I find I can modify some of the recepies to make it work for all of us.
1,no use as is,"I bought this book thinking I would be getting good vegetarian mediterranean food, and found that I had to modify every recipe I have used from it to suit my taste. The modifications included adding a little bit of olive oil here and there to make the food taste better - I find that for example lentils boiled with some onion and garlic taste pretty plain, even after adding the spices suggested. Another thing I dislike about this book is that the author uses A LOT of garlic in her dishes to make up for lack of flavor, and also that she substitutes yogurt for olive oil in quite a few dishes - what a useless idea for those of us who don't even like yogurt. Finally the organization could be better. In summary there are some interesting ideas in her book but there are much better Mediterranean/healthy/vegetarian cookbooks on the market."
1,Zero....,"I think this author hoped, that people are stupid enough to believe, that he knows something the rest of the world hasn't figured out, in the last 2000 years......Believe in your own common sense.....On the other hand, if you do want to be brain washed and used, you can get that done for free...Skip this book."
5,Best self-help book ever!,"""Self Analysis"" is a book that taught me about the natural laws of living a successful life. Just reading the first section of the book has made me happier, more confident and able to view life as a game to have fun with. Then by doing the exercises in the second section, I became able to solve problems faster and the ""game of life"" has become a joy to play. This is no book of ""psycho-babble"". Instead, ""Self Analysis"" tells you, with engineering precision, about the natural laws of life itself and then proceeds with exercises that permit you to recover your full potential to live life the way you want to. Like the author says: ""May you never be the same again!"""
5,Depressed? This book can help!,"This book was awesome. It showed me how my emotions change. And best all - it gave me an easy way to keep me happy and enthusiastic about life. The book is filled with questions that help a person recall things from their past. I don't know how just remembering the things could give me such a great outlook on life - but it certainly did.It was very easy to read, and most of the book was taken up with the memory exercises. I was actually able to recall things from my childhood that I haven't thought of since!If you want to find out what it can do for you I definitelly suggest you try it yourself. Don't just take my word for it, try it!"
4,Textbook,This is one of a series of eye opening books in a series. Only for the strong of spirit for sure. You will need to decide for yourself.
2,"Great Early, hard late.","I Bought this for a camping trip. I cleared the ground well, and laid down a tarp. I pitched my brand new tent on the tarp. I placed the mattress in the tent. It was very comfortable when I went to sleep. Sometime in the night, all the air leaked out of the mattress. I guess I should have aired it up and tried it out before going on a week long back pack trip. Just surprised that it leaked right out of the package. The old addage that you get what you pay for applies."
3,Not as good as my first inflating mattress,"I bought this mattress so that both me and my boyfriend could have our own mattresses under the sleeping bag. Air mattress are too bulking for our tent and the first self inflating mattress I bought for myself was very comfortable so I decided to buy another. But this one isn't exactly the same as the first one I got.This one is shorter than me, so I had to curl up and I was not able to lay straight on it without my feet falling off.It doesn't inflate as good as my other one, and I found myself trading with my boyfriend for the more comfortable one. That one is the Guide Gear 2' Self - inflating Mat Green and it is very comfortable.This one more comfortable then the ground, but since I had something to else to compare to other than the ground it didn't really live up to my expectations."
3,Kinda Bulky,"This is not the best sleeping pad if you need to save space as it is quite bulky, but it does the trick and it better than nothing. I would recommend this bag for someone who is going to a campsite and has their vehicle readily available (and with lots of space in it)--this is not a bag for the backpacker. It is comfortable enough, and it isn't too expensive for what you get. I might try finding something thinner (this pad is over 1.5 inches thick) if you're backpacking, and maybe something more reliable if you're planning on sleeping on top of rocky terrain. Just a thought!"
2,cant fold,"I use it one time and now it has a hole somewhere and i cant put it back in the bag, it is to big to roll."
2,Disappointed in quality,"The stuffed animal was poor quality. On receipt, I noticed it was beginning to come apart at the seams and the stuffing was coming out."
2,Defected,"Unfortunately, the doll had some hardened glue stuck to its right leg. The glue was scratching my baby's eyes. We had to return the doll in 2 days. I'm sure that if we got a good/properly made doll, my daughter would have loved it. However, now she is just scared of any pink dolls, probably because this one was hurting her."
4,good lesson plan,"This is like watching a church youth production mini skits. They are short and insightful and sends a good message across. As far as entertainment, no. But, as far as getting a point expressed as far as dating, ect...rock solid. And since they were so short; it worked to our advantage of having my children watch them and then discuss."
1,Not part of the series,"don't be fooled. This is NOT part of the TV series ""The Pretender"" starring Michael T. Wiess. I ordered it believing it to be a TV movie of the series and turned out it isn't even close! I wish someone had put in a warning before I ordered this DVD as I am now attempting to get a full refund due to the lack of good information on the item."
5,Great for teenagers,I love this movie. I bought it for my teenager. It really helped her a lot in discerning who her true male friends were; especially when it comes to spiritual values!
4,Political Intrigue,"William Haggard wrote many novels about international politics at the highest levels, almost always featuring Colonel Charles Russell. In this story Russell has long been retired from his career as head of the Security Executive, a military intelligence operation. Coincidentally, the author by this time had also been similarly retired from a military and government career in England and India. Above all this book is about political intrigue. The plot is uncomplicated. It helps that there are only a few players and you can see the playing field clearly."
3,Not quite the original,"The Big Book of Fables with illustrations by Charles Robinson, as reprinted by Lamboll House/Portland House, is not quite the same as the original edition. His wonderful color plates have been replaced by modern simplified prints, not at all in keeping with the rest of the drawings. I bought it for the illustrations more than the stories, which I also enjoyed, but this put a damper on my overall satisfaction."
3,Darren d.,ON THIS CD WAYLON Still got that outlaw sound. I like Gone to Denver and You can have her mybe two more.not what I call his best but still a ok cd.HEY 3 star`s not to bad. thank you.
5,Product feedback,"I write to inform that the product I bought from this seller perfectly matches its description - the record is in incredible good shape, the international shipping went smooth and the record arrived before the original prediction. Very trusty seller. I highly recommend this seller.Renzo Nery"
2,For Bookaholics Only,"The only audience I can imagine liking $64T is people who mindlessly devour books, and consume this one out of force of habit. There's no particularly useful information. The humor is mildly amusing at best, unless your sense of humor happens to be an exact match of the authors'. Philosophy? Generic middle class white American. Readability? Well, it's vaguely apparent that the author must have had some college level english. The only reason I didn't give it only one star is that there aren't any glaring factual inaccuracies. ...Actually, this book does have one use: as a diagnostic tool. If you find yourself reading and enjoying it, you have no life. Change something ASAP, life is shorter than you think."
4,Good Book,"I don't get the really long reviews, if people want that much info they can read the book.I enjoyed the book, and I recommend it to anyone thinking of gardening. I am new at gardening myself and found the book helpful and a good read."
4,diary of a garden,The author wrote an interesting and entertaining story of putting his garden together. With all of the failires and successes involved with the process. He did not miss a detail when writing this and anyone who has a garden will enjoy this book.
3,Ditch the Lawn,"Pleasant reading, especially in winter, awaiting the spring. A bit too many minor moral dilemmas for my taste, and I got a bit impatient reading about some of the authors habits... but I don't have to b married to him. For God sakes, get rid of the lawn."
3,Great start,"I really enjoyed the first half of the book. Funny. Fast moving. The second half seemed, well, tired as the author began to tire of the garden."
4,Gardening adventures and mishaps,"The book was laugh out loud humor with a few serious asides. I really enjoyed reading this aloud to my wife while she worked on a couple knitting projects. It was perfect for one or two humorous chapters before bed.Don't look for advice on ""how"" to garden. As a fairly green gardener myself (5 years), I can't believe the costs and problems this guy ran into with his garden. Still, I was able to identify with many of his problems of deer, bugs, weeding, and so on with a few shared laughs and cries over gardening.A good book to read for a few laughs."
4,sweet tomato,I am about 2/3 of the way through and I am thoroughly enjoying this book. This was a bookclub pick and I wasn't too excited by the title...but the garden humor is great.
4,Enjoyable memoir of a man and his garden,"I am by no means a gardening expert, more of a beginner, but I enjoyed this memoir of one man's obsession with and relationship with his garden. I found it informative and funny. I took as much what not to do, as what to do, from the book. I mean, you can see the excessiveness of his spending and learn from it as much as you can learn from the ways he fights pests on his fruit trees. I read books like this for inspiration and I was inspired by his mistakes and successes. All in all it was an enjoyable light read."
3,"Liked it, even though I disagree with a lot of his ways.","Very witty and funny. A very enjoyable read. A couple of things really stick out for me though.A. His waiting for others to plan and start his garden for him. Seems insane to me. It also made him miss out on one whole year of gardening, plus he killed his tomatoes for no reason.Why didn't he spend that money on the much needed fence? He could have rented the tiller, had the soil delivered and had the garden that HE wanted and not be talked into something he didn't want.B. What was his huge issue with mulch? I live in Houston so without mulch, we would be in trouble. I find it fun to shovel and very appealing around my plants. Seems kind of weird that he didn't use it. Would have saved him a lot of work and heartbreak."
2,Didn't Like It,"The writing in this book is excellent and it reads very quickly. Also, Alexander is at times funny. However, the entire time I was reading this I couln't stop thinking that this guy is just spoiled upper-middle class. I couldn't help feeling like he wanted the perfect garden without putting in much effort. And that, I feel, is just rediculous."
3,Nice casual read.,"Don't be fooled by all the 1-star reviews. They rated this book 1-star because the author had the audacity to use chemicals in his garden instead of growing 'organic'. That makes as much sense as saying your humane society sucks because they never have the breed of dog you want.The writing is well done and humorous. I'm more into sci-fi, fantasy, action, thriller, horror, but I do pick up the occasional non-fiction and this was a solid purchase. Not quite so funny as something by Mary Roach but entertaining none the less."
5,Can't put it down,A entertaining read while learning all types of mistakes in gardening in the Northwest. Love love love.
5,I've been there.......,"Yes......I've been there. So I can certainly relate to every page in this fun-to-read book. If you've ever tried to raise a tomato plant or two in your back yard and ..like me...keep thinking this year I'll really have some tomatoes...this book is for you. The author doesn't just plant tomatos,he tries everything from orchards to potatos to trying to create a pasture. Some of his plantings do fine even to excess but others refuse to even grow, much less produce.For fun, for a light-to-read summer book, for a lot of laughs ....read this book."
1,Another Canadian Socialist Hero.....and we have lots!,"This book is a collection of essays writtin by Mr. Watkins. He seems to be upset set that the ideals that he values so much have been discarded by modern society. For a work by an economist the book does not bring much to the table about why free enterprise should be controlled, why it has gone mad, or why it is a negative influence in the world.The book is pretty much an plea to return to the old welfare state, protectionist, Keynesian interventionist policies of past governments. The book does not give any examples of successful experiments in the policies it reccomends. There's a reason for this: Socialism has never worked."
2,"too little, too late","There is very littl information on pregnancy itself in this book, but LOTS aobut how horribly difficult it is to get and stay pregnant if you are older.I found this book uninformative and scary. I much prefer Your Over-35 Week by Week Pregnancy Guide. It has lots of information, is well organized and easy to read and is thorough without being scary."
2,I didn't like this book.,"This book only talks about all the problems you can encounter if you get pregnant and over 35. After reading it I felt sad and worrried. I am 39, I am healthy, and this book made me feel like I am too old to get pregnant."
4,encouraging and practical,I found the information in the book to be quite positive and helpful. It's not overly scientific but does provide the information most needed for women over 35 to make pregnancy decisions.
3,Out dated,"More recent books on the market have more up to date information. A better one would be Midlife Motherhood, by Jann Blackstone-Ford."
2,Scary and Discouraging,"Someone gave me this book when I became pregnant with my first child at age 34. I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. This book does absolutely NOTHING to settle the mind of a woman of ""advanced maternal age."" Get ""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" instead. It's gentle and encouraging and most of the info applies to expectant moms of all ages."
2,Good Mystery but poor writing,The story was good but the writing was not. The characters were flat and one dimensional. I have read her later books and they are a little better but the author really needs to work on character development.
4,Not in Depth,"I thought this book was great. It was very interesting, but it did not go in depth as much as I would have liked. This is the only Lindsay Chamberlain book I've read so far and I will keep reading thre series."
1,No comparison to Aaron Elkins or Patricia Cornwell,"I was very disappointed in this book. Extremely shallow characters traipse in a straight line across an unbelievable plot of unlikely coincidences.Even though this book leans on physical anthropology, it is insulting even to place it in the same category with the insightful, intricate, erudite works of Elkins and Cornwell."
1,Very disappointing,"Based on the glowing reviews I read about this book, I was delighted to find a new (to me) mystery writer. However, after slogging through the book, I was extremely disappointed. I found the many storylines to be just patched together and the characters very one dimensional. One quirky gesture keeps reappearing in the book -- the number of times that somebody ""runs his thumb over Lindsay's lips"" or ""touches her lips with his fingers"" (usually right after digging up some skeleton part - ugh!). All in all, a very juvenile read. Too bad."
2,Nancy Drew in the bones section,If you like Nancy Drew you'll love this book. It's young adult writing parading as a grown up book. Not those who like hard hitting mystery stories. The writing is rather sophomoric.
4,Great intro to a wonderful series,"I have been reading Beverly Connor books for many years. She is consistent in her plots, has good character development and the plot keeps you thinking and trying to figure out who did what throughout the book. Lindsay is an interesting character. Likeable and engrossing read."
4,If You Enjoy Bones,"It is not often that a new-to-me mystery writer sets me off on a glom o'books but this one succeeded. I had not read anything by her before, although I do like some of Kathy Reichs books and I took a lot of anthropology classes when I was young and enthusiastic and didn't mind the idea of crouching in a hole with dust plastered to my skin by sweat. In this book you get all the pleasures of archeaology with none of the sunburn and bugs.The mystery is interesting and the author does a good job of coming up with interesting bits of physical anthropology and how it connects with field archaeology to recreate a time and place. Lindsay Chamberlain is probably a bit too good at her job, but still she is interesting and her personal doubts balance her terrifying technical competence and keep her from being too perfect.There's also the usual personal conflicts and professional jealousies that occur when a group of people are brought together in cooperation and competition with one another."
5,GREAT BEGINNING!,"What a pleasant surprise! I was expecting this little cute cozy story. This is not one of those. Don't get me wrong, I love the cozies too. Ms. Connor weaves a past story with a present event in great details. Using forensic anthropology to move the story along. But, not overburdening the reader with a lot of technical detail. Explaining the things that are happening in common terms. Lindsay Chamberlain is a strong, practical and smart protagonist. Lindsay is a person that you will root for and believe in. Ms. Connor has a very good understanding of the south and its culture. The author uses all the knowledge to develop good characters to complete her story. I highly recommend this book. After searching for several years to find it. I'm sad to say that most bookstores do not carry Beverly Connor's books. I'm glad that I did stay with the hunt, till I got the Internet. What a great read. Looking forward to enjoying the Lindsay Chamberlain series for years to come."
4,Terrific Series,"This series is a favorite of mine. I've read all the books in the reverse order of their publication---starting with Airtight Case (which is my favorite). I thoroughly enjoyed each one. I gave this one 4 stars instead of 5, because I thought Connor did a better job in the other books of defining the characters. That's not to say I didn't like this one, I liked it very much. I'm looking forward to the next one in the series. (Where is it, by the way?)"
3,For guilty pleasure purposes only,"Here is ""progressive"" rock's greatest paradox- its most diehard fans tend to live in the USA, but (try as they might)American bands who sail the tricky waters of the genre usually end up sounding like Spinal Tap's ""Mark 2"" period. Bloodrock was one of these groups; I must admit though they did have theier moments.""Triptych"" earns most of its stars from ""Passage"", which was Bloodrock's most interesting album, signaling a transition from Southern Gothic hard rock to a kind of Chicken-Fried Prog sound. The music is still decidedly uncommercial, but probably considered too watered down by hard-core fans. The inclusion of ""Passage"" on this 3 album collection is the main reason to pick up a copy, and I will agreee with other reviewers that a reissue of this title alone would have been quite sufficient. Not essential, but will satisfy completists."
5,Last Lion Box Set,The books arrived in a timely fashion and would have been an excellent edition to the library but the recipeint already had volumes 1 and 2. So I have returned and have purchased Volume 3. An excellent read I am told by the Churchill enthusiast.
3,Heavy Hardbacks bound in glue? Not worth half the price!,"The content is top drawer for sure, but, for the price and weight of these heavy hardbacks one would expect they would not only be bound in stitches, but would have to be stitched out of necessity. They are not. These volumes have been bound in glue, not stitches. If they get too cold and are opened too soon they will crack. As they dry out (and they will) the spines will split and break. Pages will eventually fall out. If these books are studied and actually worked with, they will in short time, just fall apart. How many times have we found an excellent work such as this, that has been rendered difficult to handle and read with actual pages missing? And the creators of this obsolescence have the audacity to call it "" perfect binding ""! If this boxed set would be properly bound I would give 5 stars as the content is very well researched and written."
4,Garmin progression,"I own and operate a 2610, 2620, and a 2010. Fine products and provide the information and interface I like. The 2720 is a nice device and is a useful instrument. I am still adjusting to changes in the 2720 interface and use of its remote. The 2600 series is easier for me to use. My wife uses the 2620 and prefers it to the 2720. Overall I think the 2720 is a nice upgrade and do not regret my purchase. Garmin makes a user friendly GPS and I strongly recommend them."
2,"Cannot be used with a Mac in any way, shape, or form","If you are a Mac user and want to buy/use the 2720, you'll need to have a friend with a PC, too. The only way to upgrade firmware or do anything that requires connecting the 2720 to a computer is via an actual PC. If you have Virtual PC, good for you. But it won't connect to the 2720. Technical Support at Garmin cannot help you, either; they are completely Mac/VPC oblivious at this point. You can scour the 'net in search of workarounds, and you will find many. But they are for older Garmin products and with Pre OS X Macs running older versions of VPC. You will find nothing that will cure the inability for a modern Mac with or without Virtual PC to connect to the 2720 via the USB connection. I hope Garmin gets Mac compatible in the near future (or even VPC compatible). But for now, 2 stars."
1,Don't buy it!,"Way to distracting to drive and ask this thing to compute a new route, then it has a feature that ""knows best"" and will screw you, honestly, for this price it shouldn't be this difficult to setup properly. If you like driving in circles, this is the product for you. Reviewed by a retired submarine sailor, Electronics Technician!"
4,garmin 2720 street pilot GPS,Thus far the GPS unit has functioned very well and I have enjoyed it's performance. It's portability is a big factor.I am somewhat concerned as I have heard that this unit is no longer made and I feel that I may have been duped into buying a product at a reduced price simply because of the fact that it is no longer being made.
4,Garmin GPS 2720,"Never again will I travel in unfamiliar territory without 'Mabel', my new best friend. I'd rather forget to bring my cellphone than be without my StreetPilot. What a difference this tool makes!The only flaw I've noticed thus far is that sometimes Mabel can get confused when I try to set a destination that has numerics in the street name, i.e. 1410 S. 87th St. For this reason I recommend you still print out Mapquest directions as a backup."
4,GPS StreetPilot,Portability is great - one size fits all vehicles. Good map grid for negotiating thru traffic construction areas in unfamiliar territory. Voice is nice for verbal directions (a dial volume control might be better). Bean bag base is safe & secure while in transit. Have not yet used the traffic update feature. I would recommend this product to friends and others.
2,"Garmin, Lack of Navigation","First off, my house address is not in GPS system. I had to call Garmin on how to program in my home address, but it still is not right. My biggest disappointment is that when I put in an address I want to go to, it takes me around the longest route it can find. It is always recalulating on how to get me to where I want to go. I plan to sent it back."
4,Good,Easy to manage as well as to navigate.But i feel it needs little more updation on routes.But its good.
1,Stay away from Refurb,Bought a Garmin 2720 refurbished unit and it is nothing but junk. Stay away from purchasing anything refurb.
5,Hubby loves it,I bought this for my husband as an early Christmas present. He travels a lot for work and requested it. He has been so pleased with it and readily admits that it was the best present he received. It came quickly and has worked flawlessly according to him.
4,Garmin Streetpilot,The Garmin is a great product and easy to use!We especially like the ease of programming a route to follow.
4,garmin 2720,"the garmin 2720 has done an excellant job every time we have used it. the only problem is sometimes a delay at certain intersection,on secondary roads. still a great device."
5,BEST HELPMATE,"Use it for every shopping expedition--loaned it to a friend for their vacation. Easy to use, easy to read, easy to hear. Best buy in a long time!"
5,Best Money Spent,"This product was well worth the money spent. Very portable, so my wife and I just put it in whatever car we want to take. If you don't travel a lot or don't have a job that involves driving around (i.e. real estate), then you probably don't need this. Since I travel a lot, it is great to be able to find restaraunts, hotels, shopping centers, etc...all within seconds. The screen readability is awesome, even in direct sunlight. I like the fact that I don't have to download anything for it...and it has a built in memory that has maps for everywhere in the U.S. I used this when driving from NC to CA and it worked awesome."
2,Garmin Streetpilot 2720,"Product was good for about 2-3 years. Within 2 months after installing a 2009 map update, the unit quit working. After Garmin could not fix it on line, they said it would have to be returned to be repaired. Only problem, they Quoted a flat rate of $220 for repairs. Thiis was more than the original GPS cost."
4,She keeps us out of trouble,"I'm direction challenged, and can't read a map to save my life. This Garmin not only tells us where to go and how to get there, but keeps my dear husband from yelling at me for being a lousy navigator! In fact, I like it much better than the very expensive one that came with our Lexus. It's much easier to use, and offers more accurate information than the built-in GPS system. The only drawback is that ""she"" has a problem with pronunciation of street names at times, and I wish it had a larger screen."
1,The only review you need to read - unit has fatal flaw,"This was the third Garmin we've owned. Our previous Street Pilot models were inferior to the 2720. While it worked, it was awesome. Unfortunately, the unit didn't even last 2 years. The touch screen stops responding. It was infrequent at first and a hard-reset would solve the problem (and delete all the user's data.) The problem got progressively worse to the point where it's not usable. A quick search of the Internet will show that there are dozens of people who've posted the same thing happening to their young units. Garmin owes a bunch of people money."
1,Beware of this product,I have had one for almost 1 year. It work well until recently. It fails to acquire satellite signals nearly every time I try to use it now. It's useless. It will sometimes acquire a signal if I turn in on and off several times. Garmin's support is non-existent. I have updated software regularly. A web search indicates that this problem has been ongoing for quite a while.
2,Street Pilot,"This is a wonderful toy for adults. I kept driving the wrong way around town just to tick it off. Recalculating, recalculating!!! I can't wait to go on a real trip where I have to use it and truly don't know where I am going. I would like the chance to have more voices to choose from. I also don't really like the remote control. I can't figure out how to get to the previous screen."
3,Not for a Mac User,"I love this product! It is exciting to be able to get into the car, enter an address and be off not having to know the exact directions. Or, better yet, finding a restaurant or bookstore anywhere along the route.My only beef with the product is it's lack of support for Macs. I cannot update the firmware or maps because the software that comes with the product doesn't run on a Mac. I bought this back in April, 2007. I was told by Garmin that a Mac version would be available in a couple of months, so I've waited. It is now October and Garmin isn't responding to my e-mail concerning the lack of a Mac version to the software. The more roads change and businesses close/open in the area, the less helpful this product is. It was already a bit dated when I got it -- there's been a lot of construction in my area. It is very frustrating not to be able to get the maps updated!"
4,Great help,I get lost all the time and when I moved to a new state this gadget was very helpful. Sometimes it does not give you the most efficient route or will make mistakes but overall it is very helpful. I would reccomend it.
4,Garmin Street Pilot 2720 GPS Navigator,"We have been delighted with the Garmin Street Pilot 2720. It has been almost flawless in getting us where we want to go and providing the best route. Even when I ignore it's advice because I have local knowledge it recalculates quickly and accurately.It costs 20% as much as much as a built-in navigation system, is easier to update, can be pre-programed at home (it has an AC adapter with it) and can be transferred from car-to-car and even to a rental car. The owner's manual could be a lot better written but it's easy to figure out with some experience. Highly recommended."
4,Great GPS for travel with the family,"I purchased the Garmin 2720 a few weeks ago just before a family vacation. The GPS was great during our travels letting us know what restaurants and rest stops were in the vicinity of our route. The product takes a lot of anxiety out of the picture when you are not familar with an area. Really my only diappointment was the fact that the product descriptions don't tell you that you MUST have a DVD drive on your computer to install the drivers and software to customize routes. This information should be very clear to the consumer. I did have a problem with the power cable that goes into the cigarette lighter, but called Garmin and they are sending a replacement. Overall, I think the product is great and would recommend it to anybody."
4,"Great unit, very minor flaws","I really like this unit, it works very well, holds the antenna signal very well, I don't even use an external antenna and it works fabulously. Only complaint is it's not quite as customizeable as I'd like and the POI's are a little lacking in some areas. Also, when you search for things to do, it gives you too narrow of a list, the reason I say this is, if you are searching for food in an area, if you are in a city then within .1 miles there will be 50 places and then you're out of luck and have to select a different part of the city to search when it should just give you everything it has and let you decide how many places to search for. Other than that you can't say a bad word about this unit. I would have given it 5 stars, but there is some room for improvement so it can't have a perfect score, sorry garmin."
5,Best of the Pack,"After much research I narrowed down my search between the Garmin 2720 and the Roadmate 760. I had used the Roadmate many times in Hertz car rentals. No problems, but I did have a concern about unit failure problems. After lots of reading and using the two side by side I opted for the Garmin 2720. While having the speaker in the lighter plug assembly is not my cup of tea, I was surprised at how well it worked. ALso, Garmin is right on top of providing downloads for updating both software and firmware. I recently downloaded the most recent update and it was a piece of cake. Opted to purchase the external antenna. While this does not make a great deal of difference, it does appear to shorten the time required to acquire the satalites."
2,"Garmin Unit is Good, but NavTeq maps suck","Generally, the unit itself works well and is reasonably intuitive to use. I have the traffic unit and it was easy to integrate.If the Navteq maps for my area were not so bad, I would give this unit 4 or 5 stars. However, the maps for my area (San Diego) are dated and, more importantly, of poor quality. For example, new developments for which the streets have been in the Thomas Guide for two years are missing from the maps in this unit. The unit also frequently gives bad directions because of poor quality maps that do not properly distinguish side streets from collectors and arterial streets. For example, major east/west arterial streets in downtown San Diego that have synchronized traffic lights are not distinguished from side streets that have stop signs every 50 yards. Multilane suburban collector streets are frequently not distinguished from single lane side streets. The poor directions in areas I know lead me to not trust the unit elsewhere."
2,Love It! Love It! Love It!,"That's all I can say. I recently evacuated because of a Hurricane and this little gadget has made it possible for me to get everywhere I need to go. I was going to get the Tom Tom, but after reading the reviews, I got this one. I'm glad I did. Now everyone I know wants one."
5,In one word - Great !,"I like it. Even when I don't need directions, I have it set on the map, and street names come up that I never realized were there. When I do use the directions, I like the fact that it gives estimated time of arrival.It's easy to read and accurate."
4,GARMIN 2720 GPS,"A good product ready-to-use right out of the box. Good map and instruction clarity and provides most needed functions.Routes specified are sometimes done by NAME only when they are NUMBEREDROUTES - providing route numbers would be helpful. Also, a little awkward introducing mid-points into routes, but can be managed."
4,Garmin 2720 a Good Motorcycle GPS,"I bought the 2720 for both my motorcycle and car. Its a good motorcycle GPS, because it handles the vibration, is water resistant and readable in full sunlight. While riding the motorcycle with an earbud, the voice prompts mean I don't have to look at the screen in heavy traffic or otherwise need to keep my eyes on the road. The 2720 is a great GPS for car or motorcycle.Garmin StreetPilot 2720 Traffic-Ready Portable GPS Navigator"
5,Love it!!,We actually bought this as a replacement for a old GPS. Original GPS only lasted 2 years ... and Garmin's repair costs did not justify repairing. It was cheaper to buy a replacement!!
4,Jill is my pilot,"I got the Garmin 2720 because I'm forever getting lost. I decided to spend more money on this particular model because it actually gives the street names versus just saying 'turn right' or 'turn left'. I've been very pleased by Jill, which is the name for the voice w/the American accent. I've used her for up the eastern seaboard and locally, and she hasn't let me down. The only thing that may be lacking is thay you only get one choice for a route. It's my understanding that other systems give you several options. So... if I don't like the route that Jill chooses for me, I'm out of luck. The thing is, that she's never steered me wrong! I recommend the 2720."
4,Excited,"Have only had for three days and this unit has past with flying colors...purchased for wife who needs to travel in surrounding area but can get lost in driveway....she can now travel and be asurd that she can get there and home with ""the voice"" telling which way to go and if she makes wrong turn the recalculating feature gets her back on track.....only gave 4 stars as not have had long enought to give 5 but assured it will make the 5"
5,Works as advertized,"I've had this thing for about a month now and really love it. I have tested it against several known routes, and though it sometimes gives a different route than I would use, it adapts quickly to my choices. The thing is really inuitive and most basic functions can be used successfully without prior reference to the manual. The companion computer software that comes with it is not as intuitive as the unit itself, but once learned gives some powerful tools for route-planning. Downloading to the unit from the computer is simple.When you vary from the route planned, a soft female voice simply says, ""Recalculating"" and quickly gives directions to get back on route. My wife's comment was, ""That's one patient woman!"" Uh huh!"
3,Not accurate enough to measure nursing but a good scale for weighing baby,Not accurate enough to measure nursing but a good scale for weighing baby. I had thought that I would be able to measure the amount my little one gets each nursing but this scale only goes down to 10 gram increments. Works well for weighing baby who was a slow gainer.
1,"buy a better one, dont waste your time",This pen has given me problems on several occasions despite my efforts to take good care of it. It does not hold the calibration for long at all. After only 3 months the calibration mechanism is stuck and i can no longer calibrate it. Its a good way to waste your money. Ive heard good things about Hanna but this item just stinks.
5,Get ready to dance!,"This CD is replacing an old and battered cassette tape I recorded years ago from a vinyl record, so I knew in advance what I was buying. I knew it wasn't exactly what you'd call a cheap CD, but it's woth every penny. You'll be amazed with the artistry of Albert Ammons...and you won't be able to stop your feet from moving and stomping. Period. This music is incredibly energizing and uplifting!"
1,Boogie Woogie Man,A very repiticious CD with poor sound quality on several of the tracks. I would probably not listen to this CD again and consider it a waste of money.
2,WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN,Two of the top were craked the cellophane opened dry dry dry not happy should have listen to the other review
3,Same content as Rise. :-(,I bought AMOS Rise on blu ray a few years ago so thought I'd take the chance and get this one even though it's not blu ray. The key thing people need to know about this video is the content is almost exactly the same as Rise. Seems silly to have purchased this when I already have the blu ray of Rise. I hope Amazon will take it back even though it's opened. They've been very good in the past about understanding about returns. Gave it 3 stars because it's a good video but they need to tell people it's the virtually the same dvd as Rise.
4,Indeed Restful,"This DVD is 100 minutes of music and visuals aimed at providing a restful, calming ambience. It does that very well.There are 33 segments of about 3 minutes each. The main menu allows you to play it straight through, play the segments randomly, or select specific segments to watch. The visuals emphasize outdoor nature, animals, people in meditative or prayerful modes, and outer space. Aerial views of traffic flow in cities sound out of place, but they are mesmerizing.The music is varied also: Mozart piano concerto excerpt, a hymn, plainchant, original or new compositions. Orchestral, solo instrument, and vocal music are included.This is not straight ""elevator music:"" my attention was riveted throughout most of the disc. My complaints are minor. Some of the shots from moving aircraft were slow motion which caused some jerkiness in the pictures. Some description of the material used would be nice.In summary, quite pleasant."
3,ok for an older file,ok for an older file. unable to watch whole file as steaming broke up. would have watched the whole film.
1,AWFUL PICTURE QUALITY!,"This DVD release is an embarrassment - this is the worst quality picture I have ever seen on DVD!There are flopping light and dark bars, static, ghost images, and the picture is very grainy.This has been transferred directly from a BAD quality VHS copy - no remastering, no original film source.Also, because this is from a bad old VHS copy, it is also a Full Screen release.The movie may be enjoyable - Barry Morse is quite good in it - but this DVD release is terrible and should not be supported. Try one of the other sources available on amazon!I expect better quality than this, no matter how cheap the DVD may be. This listing should carry a warning about the low-grade quality of the product!"
5,step outside of yourself,"If you are tired of thinking in the same old ways, this book is for you. Loaded with ideas for a different perspective, this book provides a month's worth of continuous spiritual play. If at least three of these games don't shock you out of your rut you need a vacation. I recommend this book to everyone, open minded or not."
1,Who Loves this CD?!?,"If you read Down Beat every month and agree with the album critics etc. you`ll really love this CD! However if you are a true Jaco fan you`d probably want to smash the CD to the head of the producer of this project!The only musician stands out in the album is Marcus Miller, such a beautiful version of Portrait of Tracy. The rest of the album is really Down Beat!A poor tribute done by great musicians, that`s my two cents..."
4,"Powerful, well-written book","Amazing read for anyone interested in the ancient sciences of the Egyptians and physics in general. The ideas talked about topple a lot of the overly materialistic views of modern physics and re-introduce some profound theories that will open your mind up to possibility, if nothing else, and all in a well-researched, coherent (though sometimes a bit mathematical) and convincing narrative. Certainly worth a read..."
3,600 dollars for a $4.95 book makes no sense,I read this book and have yet to find the six hundred dollar value of information that would purport to be in it.
1,"Hocum, pure and simple","Pseudoscience for the gullible. You people will believe anything, won't you? P. Flanagan is a charlatan, and a very good one. He can't verify his own claims of invention, nor can he document any of the claims he makes about the junk he's selling you with anything close to actual science. Send him your money soon, he's running out of Guinness and gas for his Hummer."
1,"TRUST THE REVIEWS -- YES, THIS IS FAKE","I am a Salux expert. I have been using them since I was a toddler and don't; go a day without them. I should've read the reviews, as I usually do on Amazon. Guess I never suspected people would knock-off a wash cloth. These are not the long, high-quality, scrubby shower towels sold by Salux. There are much smaller, less tightly knit, and rougher. I am shocked that Amazon still sells these, especially given all the scathing reviews. I have NEVER been disappointed with Amazon (speedy, reliable, great prices) until this purchase. Extremely dissatisfied with both seller and Amazon."
1,SHOCKED THAT AMAZON IS ALLOWING THIS DECEPTION!,"I own and purchased a new Salux from Amazon's vendor. However, Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called ""Leyijie"" from China, which is inferior to the real Salux towel. I read previous reviews regarding the knock off, but, I thought once Amazon was informed about the deception to their customers, they would rectify the deception. I was wrong! I can't tell you how much I love Amazon and I am very surprised that they allow this to continue!!!!"
5,Best Back Scrubber,"I found these when I lived in Guam where you could find them in the grocery stores.As the package picture indicates you can scrub your own back with one quite easily. That picture sold me back then and am pleased to have found a source now that I live in Tennessee.They are just rough enough to give a nice tingly feeling when you scrub down, yet soft and flexible. Very nice."
1,Do not buy! This is not the real thing!,"This is a knock-off made in China, not Japan. The packaging looks similar but is a different name brand. The seller is using false advertising... what you get is NOT what the picture depicts. There is no Salux on the packaging but the Leyijie brand only, which is NOT the same thing."
5,looooooooooooooooooooove,i freaking love this thing! i use it once a week and it gets my skin nice and smooth. i've used bar soap and liquid soap on it and they both lather up equally well. i haven't had any issues with smells or anything like that. i would definitely purchase again.
1,Not Salux cloth.,"Read carefully. If you used original Salux cloth, which is Made In Japan, this is not Salux cloth. This is a third party brand (Leyjie?) made way as Salux. It is sad that Amazon is showing original Salux cloth picture for this item. They have separate sticker made and pasted on this item wrapping with Salux cloth UPC code. Looks like total fraud. This cheap item is also Made In China.I bought this to replace my 6 months old original Salux cloth. With just one wash, my 6 months old Salux cloth and this 1 day old cheap knock off looks same. So, buy at your own risk. If you used original Salux cloth before, you will know this is not the same and it is cheap. But this may spoil the value of Salux cloth for new users.If you had same bad experience with this item, don't just like this comment, please try to post another 1 star review so that it will give some clue to the customers before buying."
1,Cheap Knock Off,"These are incorrectly labeled as SALUX brand Japanese towels!As you can see I am not the only reviewer to complain about this and I can't believe Amazon hasn't done something to reprimand the supplier. I had read great reviews about the Salux towel on another beauty site and didn't think to read the Amazon reviews since I've had such success with them in the past.Like many others, I received a cheap knock-off brand called ""Leyijie"" which was *totally* inferior to the real Salux towel. I know this because I have since purchased from them directly (same price) and was MUCH happier with the real thing. A quick internet search will lead you to the Salux website - buy them there!"
1,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!,"I received some knock off of this in the mail. Needless to say, I'm getting a refund. I have read reviews about this happening to others, I didn't think I would soon become one of them. DO NOT BUY FROM ""SCS COLLECTIBLES""!!!!"
1,NOT as shown. BOOTLEG cloth.,"The product I received is NOT the product shown in the photo. I was sent a bootleg, cheap knockoff version of the SALUX cloth. The packaging is the cheap Chinese knockoff version of the real SALUX cloth packaging.I'm pissed."
1,Still the wrong item.,"Sure enough, this was not the Salux (Japanese) that I ordered,but the Leyijie Chinese knockoff. Amazon was nice enough to refund the money, but why do they let this seller continue this con? Perhaps some customers just don't know the difference."
4,best back scrubber I've used,"All I can say is I wish I found this sooner, just like most other people say, it makes your skin tingle, and it's big enough to grab with both hands and rub your whole back with no problem. Great product!!"
4,Exactly wanted I needed!!!!,This cloth is the best exfoliator I have used. I ike that I can use it for my back. It lathers it very good and I am starting to see improvements in my rough areas. I am looking forward to beautiful smooth skin.
5,The Best Wash Cloth,The Salux Nylon Japanese Bath Wash Cloth Towel is a very good exfoliating wash cloth for your body. It makes your whole body feel clean and fresh.
5,GOOD,"This book is very informative, and should be a must read for all those who are interested in black biblical facts."
1,Use a mesh bag,"I bought this product hoping it would do as it said...help my bra's keep their shape through the wash and dry. Well, that may work if the bra was able to keep it's shape when it went in to begin with. I would imagine if you were an A cup...maybe a B this MIGHT work. However, the few B's I threw in and my C's didn't fit right. The minute I put the second ball over the first they were all bent out of shape. I was also living in an apartment at the time which had a smaller washer, the ball didn't even fit between the agitator and the side of the washer so I couldn't get it in the machine. I would honestly say save your money, buy some small mesh laundry bags for the wash cycle, and hang them to dry. This will destroy your bras faster than putting them in the wash with no protection."
2,Not worth the money,"I would not waste your money. I used mine three times and the straps came out through the holes and then the plastic latch broke so I sent them back for a refund. Also, the BraBaby takes up a bunch of room in the washer, especially if you wash two at a time."
1,"Get the BraBall, NOT THIS!","I tried the Bra Baby, and the straps come out of the giant holes on the sides and get tangled with my other delicates. It's poorly designed. I also have a BraBall, and that one works like a charm. I tried this brand because it's cheaper, but I ended up wasting my money because it doesn't do it's job. I'm throwing this garbage away and getting another BraBall. (The BraBall is the blue one, in case you are looking for it)."
1,Defective Product,"Right after just the 1st use it came apart, the latch broke and my bra came out of it. I made sure I did everything that the instructions said to do and it still failed. Please don't buy this at all. Spend a few more dollars and get the BraBall instead. I am glad that I just used a Amazon Gift Certificate to purchase this. Probably no way I could return it now and get a refund...wish I could, I'm really disappointed."
1,Destroyed my bra!,"I'm so mad I didn't read reviews before buying this piece of garbage. It completely snagged my once smooth bra.....It's going back to the store, but I'm more furious about my now ruined bra!"
2,sad day,I used this product thinking that it was really gonna work but it broke on the first use !! product is made of really cheap material and the clasp that holds it together came undone and is still some place in my dryer !!!
1,bra baby,I was disappointed with the performance of the bra baby bra washing system. I am an A cup and when the wash was finished I took the ball out and the bra was all squished to one side with part of it hanging out the holes in the bra baby ball. My daughter who is a C cup couldn't get her bra to fit into the bra baby. The shipping was good and I received it sooner than expected.
2,Bra Baby not worth it if you are side D or larger,"Trying to use this product was a struggle when attempting to wash size 34-D or 36-D bras. D size cups are simply too big to fit snuggly around this contraption. I tried fastening D-sized cups to the BraBaby with safety pins, in an attempt to at least keep the cup shape from getting creases or crushed during the wash. Unfortunately the bra cups still came out of the wash misshapen. I then tried to re-shape the cups, smoothing out wrinkles and creases before air drying, but even after all that effort my bras were actually no more protected using this product than if I just threw them in a regular wash as is. I would suggest you don't waste your money and time on the BraBaby. Hand-washing or taking your chances in a Woolite delicates cycle would be a wiser choice for making a nice bra last."
3,"BraBaby Bra Washing System, 2 pack","Easy to use and keep my bra in shape. Unfortunately, one of the latches is loose/broken :o( and the bra come off after the wash.BraBaby Bra Washing System, 2 pack"
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"These are terrible. I was so excited to get these in the mail and use them, but they don't work at all. I only put one bra in (one of my older ones, because I was scared it might not work) and on the first wash it came apart and the bra came out. It also broke!!! Waste of money, going to try one of the mesh bags instead. Should have read the reviews first."
4,I've had no problems,"I didn't read the other reviews before I bought the BraBaby (if I had, I probably wouldn't have gotten it). Strangely, I have had NONE of the problems the other customers have. The only draw back I have found is that it is noisey IF in the washer or drier alone. I have not used it on a satiny bra, so I cannot comment on how that would be, but it has worked just fine on my B and C cup bras."
3,Works fine,"I ordered this product from a link that did not have any reviews, and was nervous when I read the reviews from another link. However, I found that it worked just fine. I don't think that anything will keep your expensive bras looking 100% perfect if you wash them in the machine. It did seem slightly small though. I had to stuff my molded B-cup bra into the cage."
1,Don't buy !!,"This is the worst product ever, the concept is really good it's just done very poorly.In the first use, my bra straps came out of the ball and got hooked with a pair of panties and a t-shirt,both of which got completely stretched and ruined. Save yourself some money and buy the original Bra Ball, I wish I had from the beginning."
1,completely frustrated!,"I bought the BraBaby after I hearing positive reviews, came on here read a couple of reviews that weren't good at all.... I stubbornly bought it and both of them popped open in the washer, both locks snapped (plastic actually broke), the smaller ball in the center was broken as well, leaving my bras freely floating around the washer. AH!! I'm hoping for better results with the Lingerie Cage.. I read that it works well!"
3,Warning for D cups (possibly C),I thought this would be a purchase that would pay for itself in a few laundry loads because I seem to ruin bras with dents and bumps but don't have the patience to hand wash them. Unfortunately what they don't tell you is that the product does not fit a D cup bra with underwire! I would be skeptical if a C cup fits as well. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU WEAR A D cup!!!
3,brababy,"fair, adequate, fragile - not rugged or robust. Minimum care and user instructions. Not intended for longterm use? Requires experienced owner/user."
4,easy and protected washing,It protects underwear washed in it without de-shaping underwear. But I think the price could be cheaper but about several dollars.
1,Don't waste your money,Complete waste of money. Bra straps still managed to slip out and get wrapped around the agitator then after about 3-4 washings the cheap plastic cracked and broke. Do not buy!!
2,Not worth it,"All together I purchased 5 BraBaby's. One broke within the first two washes, two broke within the first four washes, and the other two lasted maybe 8 months. The ones that lasted 8 months did a good job of taking care of the bra, but that doesn't do me a lot of good if they break."
1,Very Unhappy,I was not able to use this product. It did not say anywhere in the add that it only fit certain size bras. DO not buy this if you are a c or larger... It does not fit and will wrinkle your bra!
1,Worthless,Don't buy it! It doesn't hold the bra snuggly enough so it still can fold up & crease. It's just as bad as my usual method of throwing it in a mesh bag & washing.
1,Don't buy unless you're a 34B or smaller. 36s need not apply.,"I was so excited when I ordered this product, but then so disappointed when I got it and discovered my bras wouldn't fit inside. My bras aren't that big, all either size 36B or 36C. But when I tried (just out of curiosity) to see if a 34B would fit inside, it did . . . barely. So it seems that the wires on any 36 bra are too wide, but that wires of a 34 might be okay . . . but that's a close call, too. I wish they had been more upfront about needing to wear a 34B or smaller before selling them to 36Bs like myself."
1,Warning: don't waste your money on this product,"I wish I had read all the reviews before buying this product. I followed the manufacturer's directions. Each time I used it, the straps came out of the holes and ended up tangled with the rest of my laundry. Because of this tangled mess, the elastic got stretched out of shape in the back of the bra. This was a very expensive bra and I'm fortunate that I didn't ruin it. I will follow Nordstrom's recommendation and wash my bras by hand. I am a mechanical engineer by training so I know how to follow directions. The product is just very poorly designed and I wouldn't waste money on purchasing it."
1,Broke on first use,"This item broke the very first time that I used it. It came apart, the latch parts were lost, the pieces that position the halves in place broke off. Horribly constructed."
3,ehhh,this product works ok but it is not quite big enough. my 38 B cups barely fit and have to be folded slightly for the ball to close. great concept but i would get the bigger ones if i ordered them again.
2,Disposable?,"These items are a great idea, but within a few washings the latching tabs broke in the wash. Since they won't replace these parts, I guess they are only meant to last a very short time. If that's the case I'll order them for much less from the Hong Kong vendors on the Amazon site, or I'll try the original expensive BraBall that is supposedly tested to last a thousand washes."
1,Not worth the time or money,"First, it comes with no instructions on assembling the cheaply made plastic pieces. It took me ten minutes to get the thing to stay together. Second, it does not hold more than 1 bra, which defeats the purpose of doing a load of laundry (unless you only own one bra!!) The item received was not a ""BraBaby,"" rather it was labeled ""bubble bra."" Not sure if that is related to the lack of quality or not."
3,"Cute story, but easily forgettable","""Meet Prince Charming"" has some some serious echoes of 1998's ""You've Got Mail"", but on it's own is a light, funny, sweet (but sometimes downright) and stupid romp.David Charvet and Tia Carrere play feuding neighbors who hate each other in public, but they are unwittingly in love when they start chatting online. Soon after, they start being friendly to each other. This otherwise predictable romantic comedy takes a surprising twist and has a few comic bits--but still, the two main characters end up happily ever after... as the title would suggest.Although not as good (or as witty) like ""You've Got Mail"", the actors deliver their lines with low-key zest, the result is a light, fluffy--but ultimately forgettable--romantic comedy that's most likely to appeal to lovers of chick flicks... while other demanding viewers will most likely be disappointed.Rated R for language and brief nudity."
1,a bad chick flick,"Like many a chick flick, the heterosexual couple at first hate each other and then fall in love. Tia C. has blonde hair meant to make her look white, but why the charade when you're a famous Asian-American actress. David Chavret has ironed-flat lips. Unlike George Michael, his 5 o'clock shadow looks nasty and haggard. This work was simply not enjoyable. The only plus is the brief male nudity in it. There are too many quality chick flicks to waste your time on this stinker."
2,"david better than baywatch, but...","In this movie, david Charvet starrs in a role that appears to be better for him as the role he tried on in Baywatch. His (needed) acting lessons do show of, but he still needs some coaching. Tia Carrere is a bad singer and an even worse actress. Story not too bad. Directing could have been better"
3,NOT REGION 1,"Buyers be aware that this Blu-Ray as advertised is Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Amazon needs to include more information about this fact other than the very brief statement in product detail. Will not work in Region 1 Blu-Ray players, but will play in Region Free players."

1,The Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"This book is a wasteland. The characters are all flat, and stupid. Most of them are the same person. Analogies with technology that were meant to make the book seem modern and edgy only show just how poor the author's understanding of technology really is. The conclusion is a pile of puerile, self-congratulatory nonsense.Every other page either has the word 'plug,' 'outlet,' or depicts our protagonist having sex. Guess what? ""PLUG"" and ""OUTLET"" are Taguchi's idea of a clever reinterpretation of SEX. (spoilers!) Our main character is a woman, thus OUTLET. Good job, there. Very deep.They ought to call her ""Ozymandius"" Taguchi, because when I look upon her works, I despair."
1,what a stinker,"wow, this book was a stinker. it's been a long time since i've read a book that so drearily insisted on explaining, ad nauseum, every last thought the author has. she might as well have given us a manual. at least it might have had pictures.the characters are flat and lifeless (no doubt they ran away as soon as they discovered that the author wasn't going to let them speak). the plot wants to be a philosophical with a macabre twist when it grows up, but it has sooo much growing up to do. at the end, the book devolves (if such a thing is possible) into a quasi-poetic slush of self-congratulatory drivel, which, if nothing else, leaves the reader free to skim those last 15 pages and, with relief, close the book and throw it in the resell pile.if you want good, weird japanese fiction, go read haruki murakami or banana yoshimoto. don't waste your time on this one."
4,More than a mere Ghost story,"When I bought this book, I expected to be entertained by another good Japanese tale of ghosts and spirits.However Outlet is much more than that.Yuki, the main character is a young woman who lives her life and sexuality as a man: she is emotionally detached and is not shy about living a full sex life.She comes from a very dysfunctional family, her father is a drunk, her mother is abused and her brother is just plain strange.The latter dies of self starvation, and when Yuki visits his appartment she smells the smell of death.She also sees his ghost, but that ghost is there to give her amazing revelations concerning her own nature.This is an interesting and entertaining book, even for skeptic readers like me ."
2,Save your guilders.,"Does there really need to be a whole book based on what should only be anecdote told around other market crashes? Spoiler alert: The answer is no.I have no training in sussing out the veracity of historical data but Dash presents his facts in a well thought out and believable way. I find no fault with his writing. However, this short book drags on and on and I soon lost interest. The Wikipedia article is more informative and doesn't waste as much time getting there."
3,"good movie, bad DVD","This is the second Fox Lorber DVD that I've bought, and both are horrible transfers. The entire movie looks dark, especially compared to the version I saw on DBS, and, if you freeze at any point, the edges of images have ghost images (no pull-down technology?). This is a nice, thoughtful film that deserves better."
5,A wonderful movie!,"This was an incredibly touching video about a girl trying to live how she wants while being smothered by her family's values. It's an intelligent movie, and done extremely well. It is well worth the money for the DVD!I'm not going to summarize this movie, because that's been done, but suffice it to say that if you enjoy dramas, and movies that are based on great plot and charechters, and not millions of dollars in special effects, you will love this movie."
4,just nice,i saw this movie on cable recently. i only wish my vcr was running. it was a sweet story about a young girl who faces issues we all face in our life.
2,Slow delivery,Ordered October 9th.... Not delivered as of November 22nd. Now due to arrive mid December. Yuck.
1,Not Work,I recieved this remote control without any instructions. Try to use and activate the camera but without success. I've read the Nikon D40x camera manual but again there is not a word of how to set up this remote control. I've returned this item. Very disappointed!!!
1,Why No Product Manual or Instruction Sheet?,"Amazon.com is apparently aware that this Nikon accessory is being shipped without any product manual or instructions whatsoever. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have used Nikon equipment since 1970, many times professionally, under harsh conditions. The absence of even a short data sheet or instruction sheet is unacceptable. I recommend Amazon.com contact Nikon USA and ask them for an explanation for this ommission. If Nikon USA is unwilling or unable to supply a product manual or product instructions, Amazon should drop the product, and/or find a replacement, if there is one."
1,piece of junk,"It is not working, i've tried changing the batteries but nothing, zippo. Made in China."
3,works good,Does not come with directions and I had a hard time getting it to work. But I finally got it working. I havent had a chance to use it yet though.
1,wrong order,"I can't give any star because I did not check the description clearly when I ordered it, but find it not suitable for my D700 only after I receive it. AS Amazon takes very long time to refund your money, I decide to keep it."
2,Not Much Use,"I had great hopes for this little gizmo, but because the sensor is on the front of the D40X it's difficult to use it...not to mention the distance range is pitiful. It might be OK for self portrait type shots, but is of little use to capture birds, etc as I had hoped."
1,Disappointed,It was cheap so I don't feel too bad. It just doesn't fire consistently. I have read all the reviews and I worked with it for a good while on several different occasions before coming to this conclusion. When it works it's great. Now I am just using the timer in the camera.
4,A good addition for a photographer,Works great but would have been nice if it had come with instructional manual. I am pleased withe the additional freedom to take natural photo shots.
5,Device worked as expected,"I was shocked when this devices worked for our camera. We haven't been in a situation to actually use it while shooting, but it does work as I was hoping and was a great gift."
5,Wireless remote,"It does what I expected it to do. You can beat it for the price, and it's easy to carry."
4,Helpful little product,This is definately worth the $20.It frees up your hands for those portraits you want to be involved in as well timed/long exposures and all other situations where you want to minimize camera shake as much as possible. Couple the ML-L3 with a quality tripod and that should suffice for any touchy situation you may have.I gave it four stars due to the fact you have to be in front of the camera for it to work.I suppose if you are creative you could hook up some sort of mirror contraption lol.
4,Good But Not Great,"This tiny remote hides good in your hand. You have to be pretty close to your camera with a clear path to the sensor (on the front of the camera), but thats not the remotes fault. It comes with a battery but I sometimes wonder if supplied batteries are as fresh and would work better if new ones were used. I do recommend it and would buy it again."
5,Well worth the price.,"This remote should come with the camera. Works great. Indoor use where it can ""bounce"" off the wall it will work from behind the camera."
4,Nikon Wireless remote,First the delivery is quick as expected. I started use it immediately. No issues so far and happy to bought it.
4,Original accessory,Worked great first time. Just as the manuel said it should be. Like to stay with the same product name.
2,It does not work all the time,"I bought this remote about three months ago and have tried to use it a couple times, with little success. It looks like you have to point right into the camera lens to get it to work. I felt like a clown clicking and pointing to different directions just to make it work. There must be some kind of bluetooth or radio communication devices to make this better. The D90 has a connection for external remotes, so the other Nikons should have it, too."
3,"Even though I did not give it a great review, I would still buy anotherone","Ok well I got this remote because I lost my first one, the first one I had worked great, this one not so much, it will work the first two times, them I have to eject the battery cartridge and reinsert it and it will work again on my D90, but I have to be fast because after about 15 or 20 seconds it gets off the remote setting. Event with this issue I would still buy another one if this one ever got lost just because if your ever doing self portraits like I do it will make your life a lot easier.... when it works"
3,Is not like you have a lot of other options...,"This device does what it's advertised to do. 1) you set your Nikon to ""remote"", 2) compose your shot, 3) click and voila... you have a picture without camera shake artifacts. You must have a remote shutter control if you're planning on taking night shots without flash or long exposure shots. However... there is one very anoying detail: the device doesn't seem to work well from behind the camera. You'll have to keep pressing the buttun until you find that sweet spot where the infrared sensor on the *** front *** of the camera is aligned with the remote; i've used it for only a couple of days and I already missed a few ""perfect shots"". Now that I learned the trick, I can work it out... but still, very annoying. Also, the device is too small and too light; it's easy to loose, and hard to find in your packed camera bag. All in all, you still have to get one of these; I wish there were more options out there, though."
5,Great purchase,"This was definitely a great purchase. Works great, is small and easy to use. Love that it has the half-push focus option as well. For the price, you just can't beat it. Good luck fellow photographers!"
4,It works,"Didn't really used it much, but for what I know it works great. Always nice to measure the white point and it's small enough to fit into any camera bad small pocket."
5,Great remote,"For $20, no one should be without this remote. I bought it and used it for a few days just to mess around with. Then I didn't touch it for about a week. One day I decided to shoot some sparklers and firecrackers just to experiment with. The remote made it easy to light something, get out of the frame and take the shot, without having to run to the camera to press the shutter button. I've also used it for nighttime shots of the moon, and a family portrait at a reunion. It makes for absolutely no camera shake when taking long exposure shots, and makes it easy to not be behind your camera when taking the photo.I highly recommend this. It comes with everything needed to use it, and as I said, for $20 you can't afford not to have this."
4,Great when it works,"This little device provides great hands-free operation of my D50 and D80 cameras. There is no need to use timer and run from the camera to be in the picture. I also use it for taking portraits so that I could have more interactions with the subjects. When I used it indoors, the distance and the direction the remote is pointing to was great.Sometimes, the shutter of the camera did not release upon pushing the remote. The camera did not provide any error information when that happened. It was very frustrating when you pushed the remote and nothing happened and while you walked back to the camera, the shutter released. The same problem occurred to the shutter release on the camera occasionally, so I can't completely blame on the remote. But being feet away from the camera and could not get the camera to work is aggravating."
5,A must have.,"I have had this for about 2 weeks now. I have not used it for a family portrait, but I did use it from some night shots. I like being able to get my shot in focus, step away from the tripod and just push the remote button and it will take the picture no jiggling the camera or bumping the tripod when you have to push the button on the camera! The range is very small when firing from behind the camera, but more then acceptable. The remote does everything it needs to in my opinion and is easy to operate. I say for this price it is hard to beat. Worth having in your camera bag."
4,Nikon Wireless Remote,It works well. One drawback; there are no instructions. You have to use the camera manual and your imagination.
4,cheap fun!,"This is surely the best bang for the buck fun accessory I've gotten for my D50. As other reviewers point out, it can sometimes be frustrating to use -- it needs line-of-sight to the camera and sometimes fails to fire. And it's much harder to use out of doors where it can't bounce of walls, it needs to be aimed *straight* at the camera.but at the same time, it's only fifteen bucks. Even if it isn't perfect it's a must-have."
1,Incorrect Product,"Purchased remote from Amazon, would not work with my Nikon D3100,so I purchased another correct one that would work, unfortunatlly it has a cord attached to plug into the camera."
2,Very limited reaching area.,If you like to do a Family Picture with you on it and trying to get on the right side of the picture view - most of the time it will not work (on D90). It won't work from side or behind aether. (Infrared signal have to be directed strictly to the Infra Red sensor area.)
2,Nikon wireless remote,"I use the remote control unit with my Nikon D90. The farthest I've been able to get my remote to trip the D90 shutter is only 7 feet. I have changed out the battery in the remote and I still get the same distance. I still can not get my remote to to trip the shutter while the camera is in ""Bulb"" setting."
5,Small and simple,"I've been using ML-L3 with Nikon D40 and the combination works really well.I was able to trigger the shutter while to the side of the camera and several feet away. The thing is tiny so it'll fit anywhere and even comes with a nice protective pouch.The suggested price is high for what essentially is a simple infrared remote with one button, but the convenience is worth it. With Amazon's discounted prices it's a no brainer."
2,Remote,"When I bought this product I didn't read (and I'm pretty sure it wasn't clarified anywhere) that this remote wouldn't work in my Nikon D3100. So, I haven't been able to test it."
3,nikon remote,"this is great for group or family pics, a bit of a pain to set up and can only be used in certain modes..but all in all worth the money since we have a large family"
1,Dead on arrival.. or so I thought!,"Original post: The first time I ordered this remote, when it arrived it didn't work at all. I returned it and re-ordered it when it became available again.. and again it didn't work! I checked the battery with a battery tester and it was fine, but when you press the button on the remote, you don't see any light being emitted from the sensor. And of course, it doesn't operate the camera (I have a Nikon D60).UPDATE: See the response by Passante.. for the D60 you need to manually change the release settings so it will respond to the remote. After changing this, it worked like a charm! Unfortunately, I can't seem to change my rating, but I'd move it to 5 stars if I could."
3,Works well but..........,This little gadget does an adequate job as long as it can see the sensor(front of camera) Useless from any other position.
3,nikon remote... OK- not great,I got this to take pictures of kids and not have to stand behind the camera. I have to be directly in front of the camera or it don't work.I also have to reset my camera before I can do it again.. remote is just ok....
3,"Useful, but not great.","Yeah the remote is useful specially when you have set up the shot and have to move from behind the camera to fix something. However the limitation is the sensor on the camera. A cable is probably a better option. Regardless it is a good piece of equipment and I do use it. I like it fine, but I'm not crazy about it. Just another piece of equipment to use when necessary."
3,Hope It works!,"I think the remote is a great idea, especially for the product shoots I have to do. I thought I was getting a good deal by combining with some other purchases to get free freight, However, once I received the item, I discovered that it didn't work, due to a DEAD battery. So I have to go out and pay another $2.50 to replace it, so maybe I didn't get such a great deal after all. Amazon must either have a large, old inventory or they're not selling very quickly."
3,remote,"it is a christmas gift, so i won't know much about it until then, but it arrived quickly with no problems"
4,A handy device to have,"This is something that even the high end Nikons could use.Easily hidden, so you can use it while you're in the picture. No setting the timer then rushing to get into the shot. And the thing I like most about it, I can set up the camera a few feet away and take pictures of that pesky rabbit that's been digging up my yard.I Highly recommend this."
5,Great wireless camera trigger,"I've used this for several months now to trigger my Nikon D90, and have had no real problems. You won't have the range of a ""true wireless"" remote (e.g., Paul C. Buff Cybersync plus wired electronic release, if such a thing exists for the D90), but this costs a fraction of that price. I have rarely had issues with the range -- it seems to drop out around 15-20 feet (at least in bright sunlight)."
2,Not for shooting BEHIND the camera.,"I bought this for shooting from behind the camera, with the camera on a tripod... to reduce camera shake and blur. Useless. It works fine if I shoot from the side (where I can't really see my LCD screen anymore) or if I shoot from in FRONT of the camera (I have no desire to photograph myself right now), but not if I stand behind the camera in live mode. Disappointed :("
5,Good remote control,"No problems at all, I use it with my D51000 and it works like a charm. Reasonable price and good quality product, recommended."
5,For the camera buff!,"I am sorry,I can't be more specific. I bought the item as a gift for my 2 adult children. They love to take photos and are always using their tripod and timers to get into the pictures themselves. they were excited to get the remote control to be able to have more time to position themselves in group pictures. I know that it made our family Christmas pictures a whole lot easier to take. It will come in handy when they are traveling with a companion and want to both be in the pic...no more having to ask someone to take the pic for them."
4,Great Accessory,This is a nice compact device for triggering my D60 and D5000. I prefer using this trigger over using the timer. Nikon should make this a standard accessory with their cameras.
4,Tricky but cool.,"First of all, the service was great! I received the order a couple days before the actual ""send out"" date.The product itself is tricky when trying to trigger the shutter just because one has to point it toward the rightside of the camera. Other than that I think it's marvelous. No other complaints yet. :)"
4,"Ehh... it works, but eats batteries","Now it's possible that I'm using this ""too much"", but I've gone through 3 batteries in one year. To me, that's a bit excessive. It works just like it's supposed to so it gets 4 stars."
2,Nikon ML--L3 Wireless Remote,"Received this unit on time. Was excited to use it, but I can't make it work with my Nikon 5100. This is the device recommended by nikon to use. There was no directions with the remote or in the camera manual on how to operate this unit. I looked at several books and nothing about how to use the remote. So I give it an overall rating of 2 stars."
4,It's a remote. It works.,"It's a wireless shutter remote. It does what it's supposed to do. While I see no actual flaws with it, it would be nice if it were either more solidly constructed (given the cost), or if it cost less the way it is now. Still, this is more convenient than a cable remote, and at least on my camera (D7000) the IR receivers on the front and back have a sufficient angle of ""view"" that I doubt the wired remote would offer much of an advantage."
3,Needs a lot of practice,"I know this product works, it worked for me part of the time. However, the instructions are nonexistant and it does not work consistently. I am going to have to practice with it to figure it out. I really would prefer and old fashioned cable and plunger from back in the old film days. This is the only remote control for the DX-40, so I recommend you practice a lot with this before going on a shoot so you don't get frustrated and angry when you have other people around or a once in a lifetime shot of fireworks."
1,Does NOT work for the Nikon D3100 model,"Despite the description stating that this remote is used for Nikon DSLR cameras, this remote does NOT work with the Nikon D3100 camera model."
4,Does its job but could be better,"I bought this remote from amazon.com and received it quickly. The remote works fine and does what it is supposed to do. Mine even worked behind the camera. The range is fair and sensitivity is ok but sometimes you have move the remote around and press the button a few times before it will work at distance. Overall, you can't beat the price and the fact that it is wireless is a great benefit."
5,Digital camera MUST HAVE accessory,"If you buy a Nikon D50 or D70, this is a must have accessory. Costs about the same as a quality old style cable release but has the added feature of NO POSSIBILITY of shaking the camera while in use.Works from in front or from behind the camera and either operates the shutter directly or activates the self timer depending on camera settings.Great buy, flawless product."
2,"Works as advertised, but not with UV filters","I have UV filters on all of my lenses. Because the remote sensor is inside the lens, the UV filter blocks the incoming beam from the remote. Something to take note of if shooting outdoors."
3,not for the nikon d3100!,"if you have a nikon d3100 dont buy this! i bought it thinking it would go great with my d3100, but apparently these remotes are not for the d3100.."
4,A Nice Accessory,"This remote works well but the range is a bit limited, however this may be due more to the location of the sensor on the camera than the construction of the remote. Overall, definitely worth having in your camera bag."
4,Tough little thing,"Down Side: The only down side is that the lack of range, you can get maybe 5-6feet before it stops working.Upside: It's SUPER durable, after the first use I accidentaly washed it.... it still works. Came with a case that easily attaches to the neck strap."
5,Best Toy Ever!,"Okay.. this is the best remote ever. I have tested other remotes, but this is the best! Better get two, because it is so easy to misplace."
5,Perfect Product for Specialty Work,Remote arrived quickly and works as described. This product is great for long exposure shots as well self portraits. Very small and easy to throw in your camera bag.
4,worthwile addition,"The Njkon ML-L3 wireless remote control is an inexpensive but valuable tool for improving the quality of individual photographs. It can be used with or without a tri-pod mounting for the camera.Another possibility, subject holds the remote control,the photographer readies the camera providing no movement during the taking of a photo.The only downside is the small size of the control."
5,Simple to use and indispensable ... works with J1/V1 also,"Works with most all current and previous Nikon consumer model DSLRs as well as some P&S; such as P6000 and P7000/P7100 and also with mirrorless Nikon J1/V1.Simple to use - activate the remote setting in the menu, then point and click. Invaluable in doing long exposure shots. Range is pretty good, up to about 20 ft."
3,It Works,"The remote works for this camera, just not as well as I'd hoped. It's not as fast as I was expecting to be. That could be more of a function of the camera, though. It does what I needed it to do. There's just a couple of things that could make it easier to use. The seller was great. Fast too."
4,Nice tool to have in your camera bag.,"This remote is very useful. It is easy to use, small and lightweight (just don't loose it!) and has some cool features. You can set your Camera to release the shutter upon pressing the button, or on a 2 second delay. Works great for Portraits on the tripod or also for long exposures to reduce camera shake."
2,Difficult to setup with Nikon D40,"The product works well once it is calibrated with the camera. But it is difficult to remember how to calibrate it. Due to that, I find myself using the camera's timer more than I use this remote.If you decide to buy, It is best to use the two second delay feature with this remote. That means the shutter will release two seconds after you press the button. That will prevent you from taking photos of yourself pressing the remote."
4,TODO OK,"TODO MUY BIEN,,EL PRODUCTO FUE TAL CUAL SE DESCRIBE..SE USO Y FUNCIONO MUY BIEN....EL PRECIO FUE BUENO"
1,"The Wireless remote control Nikon is not working, I thoug it was the batery but I changed and at the end the control is not work","What can I do the Wireless control is not working. I changed the bateries but and the end is not the baterie, what can I do, I live in Venezuela.Thanks"
1,nikon ml-l3 wireless remote control--- request for guidance,"I have tried a lot of different things and am unable to get the product to work. There were no instructions. Maybe there's a setting I don't know about? I put the camera on manual or auto, with or without the rubbver protective casing, and it doesn't work at all. I have a Tamron lens. I don't know where the pickup is for the remote or whether you have to be in front of the camera to trigger it. None of the reviews I saw on Amazon addresses my challenge."
3,Worth about $5...,"Just got this remote and its a joke. It's the size of your thumb, weighs about an ounce less than a fly and is basically just a little round battery and a button. It's completly cheap...not worth no dang $15 that I paid even at Amazon price. If you don't need this real bad, save your stupid money and pick one up in a couple of months when they're hopefully $5. My D90 has a tricky way to turn this thing on also...just not worth it, I should have ignored Amazon's recommendation to buy it."
1,Doesn't Work on D90. No instructions. Poor Quality.,"This product is somewhat junkie in my opinion, for a Nikon product.There was no information sheet included. It would be nice to know the operational range and angle, and information on the battery.I tried it on my D90, and it didn't work. I assumed it came without batteries. Opening the battery compartment will result in broken fingernails.I finally gave up.The MC-30 works fine on my D200-by the way."
5,Works Great!!!! Does what it needs to do.,"All the people that rate this 1 star or say that ""It doesn't work"" need to be smarter. On many cameras you need to change the shutter release settings for this to work. READ YOUR OWNERS MANUAL! Works great for me. I've used it with D60, D40, D40X, D90 and D5000."
5,Must have tool for your DSLR,"I put off buying a remote for my Nikon D80 for a while because I wasn't sure I ""needed"" it. But then whenever I would try to get a night shot, or we'd have to run back and forth to use the timer for family photos I was annoyed. So finally I gave in and bought it. I was nervous it would be difficult to use, but it's SO easy. You literally just set the camera to receive the remote and push the button. What could be easier!?! It's so small I'm a bit nervous about losing it, but thankfully it comes with a little carrying pouch that slides onto your camera strap for safe keeping. Especially for this price, it's a must have."
4,Fine product; poor instructions,"Let me state right off the line, that this is a very good product, giving a wireless remote control solution that is both cheap and easy to use. Great for including yourself in family or scenic photos without having to outrun the self-timer. It also ensures that you will not shake the camera pressing the shutter release in longer exposures.That said, setting up your camera to receive the remote's signal is not intuitive (at least, not for me). Compounding that, no instructions are included with the product. I first thought the controller was broken.Compounding that, there are instructions buried in my D80's manual, but they are simply not found with a logical search of either the table of contents or the index. After an email to Nikon (and a strong recommendation to throw in an instruction sheet), everything is fine.With that caveat, buy this product. If a brief instruction sheet were included, this product would easily get a five-star rating from me."
5,fun to use,I brought this after I realized I was not in many of the pictures with my new daughter because I was behind the camera taking the pictures. Now I can place the camera on a tripod and be in the pictures. Fun to use with the D50. You may have to point it directly at the camera but can probably point at a reflecting surface and bounce the signal to the camera also. So far I am happy with this product.
4,Also works with D40,"I just bought mine at my local camera store for $18.00, so Amazon's is a GREAT price. I have only used it to test it so far, but it worked fine with my Nikon D40."
5,Great Little Remote for the Nikon D50,I purchased this remote to enable me to include myself in some photo's without having to set the timer and get into position. This allows me to take numerous shots at once if needed. A small price to pay for convenience.
4,Perfect Addition to Your Nikon Accessories,"The remote is quite handy for low light and longer exposure shooting. Providing you have a tripod or you are able to keep the camera still, this remote is perfect. I was able to get great 4th of July shots and night scenes with the use of the remote."
5,Nikon remote for D80,This gizmo works great for taking group pictures. Nikon should supply it with the camera however.
4,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for D50 & D70 Digital SLR Cam,Works great but the sensitivity is quite poor you have to to be in the middle in order for it to work...overall its ok.
5,very handy to have in the camera bag,"with this remote control, which hardly takes up any space in the bag, allows you to be in the picture and also keeps the camera still while shooting."
4,Works well,Been using this for about a month now with my Nikon D50. It's a remote - so it's pretty basic. But it does what it's supposed to and that's okay with me.Buy it where it is cheapest.
5,Star Performer,"This works great in group shots where I'm part of the picture, placing the camera in the corner and snapping candid shots, or placing on a tripod and triggering instant shots so there's no movement. Has worked every time I've used it, and I carry it with me all the time."
3,Limited use!,The range of effective connection via infrared is short. It does work but the working distance is limiting its use! I wasn't that much impressed with this control.
3,Finicky,"I'm not sure if i just don't know how to use this, but I sometimes have to point it at certain parts of the camera for it to trigger the shutter. It would have been better if it triggered from any where otherwise I may as well use a cord. Other than that it works."
4,meets expectations,"Useful piece of kit, cheap and functional. I love what it lets me do. Note to Nikon: this should be a part of every decent camera kit (like the D70 kit I bought this to use with)."
2,Mixed feelings also,"Like another reviewer's, my experience has been mixed. I use this remote with the D50.Sometimes the remote works, then it goes on strike. Then suddenly it works again. Same distance and angle from the camera.I changed the battery - same result. I hardly use it anymore because it is so unreliable."
1,Didn't work with my camera,Write up suggests that it works with all of the Nikon cameras but it does not work with the D3100.
4,Great Product for short distances,"I bought this remote for my D60 about a month ago and i have used it a few times. Its a nice product, its small, light, and easily concealed if you're taking pictures of yourself. The range on it isn't the greatest (about 15 feet), but if you have an 18-55mm lens like I do range isn't that big of deal. It fits nicely in you hand, but its easily misplaced because of its size."
4,Using remote to shoot wildlife,I'm planning to use this remote for shooting wildlife like birds feeding on a bit of bread and stuff like that. It's quite difficult to take these shots as birds simply won't come close to a grown man lying on the lawn waiting for a bird to land on his loaf (shush your dirty minds!).I understand that you have to manually focus the camera before using the remote? Wouldn't it be great if the remote would also autofocus before each take? Perhaps in a next upgrade?
5,Nice Little Gadget,I use my remote for taking pictures of my wife and I when we go on vacation. I just put my camera on a tripod and set the camera to remote and that's it. I also use it when I'm taking pictures with slow shutter speeds to avoid camera shake. I use it on my D70 and my D40X. Very nice and worth the money.
4,"tiny, does what is described.","I use this with my D7000. Go into remote trigger or mirror-up mode, find out the IR sensors at the back or front of the camera, and press it to shoot away.Note that if you are on bulb exposure and remote trigger, the first press of the remote opens the shutter, the second closes it. If you are in M-up mode, the first press removes the mirror, the 2nd opens the shutter, and the 3rd closes it.The only problem I have faced is that I have to put the remote very close to the sensor to actually trigger the IR. Sometimes the IR does not catch on, and multiple presses are then required."
5,Works great - make sure it's for YOUR camera,"Very happy with this little remote, which comes WITH a battery already installed. Two advisories: First, you need to set your drive/remote settings to use the remote (press on the ""multiple rectangles"" just below the icon showing the remote, then turn the knurled wheel at the rear of the body). Second, make sure that this is the remote that works for your camera. It states very clearly in the description which models this works for, yet sadly there are some negative reviews from people who said, ""it didn't work with my D3100, my D300, etc."" And that's because it's not designed to."
3,perfect gadget in gatherings,Before i had this gadget it takes a while for a group to react when i say cheese but after having this remote i can keep my group family photo lively and fun!!
4,Nikon remote shutter release,simple and effective - must be one of the best value gadgets you can buy for your Nikon. It would be nice if they supplied the blanking piece for the eye-piece as part of the price. The only downside is that it's pretty small so you need to develop a good routine when you use it - this thing is easy to lose! The small pouch can be eaasily slipped onto your camera strap - that's what I do with mine. I have also wrapped some hi-viz tape on it to make it more visible.
2,Get the Opteka,"Used this for two years with D40x, D60 and D3000, biggest complaint is that you must be in front of and close to the camera, within 3-4 feet. Just got the Opteka version which is twice the size which makes it easier to operate for me, has far better range and will work from behind the camera.Opteka RC-2 Wireless Remote Control for Nikon D40, D40x, D50, D60, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D3000, & D5000 Digital SLR Camera (Nikon ML-L3 Replacement)"
4,Good to have!,"Like others, i think this should be free with the camera. I finally gave in and got it and i am glad i did. I'm not quite sure what the issue is for some with set up, it is easy and if you can't work it out on your own, just look at your Camera's manual for directions. A few time's it has missed a shot but overall it is a good addition to my Camera and allows me to be in the photo!"
4,Good if you want to be in the shot.,"Normally, I don't, and until recently, it doesn't seem that Nikon has awakened to the fact that back-side sensors make sense!If you don't have a back-side sensor, and you don't want to hassle with getting in front of the camera...also, if you care about decisive moments, get a corded electronic release.One of these came with my first Nikon DSLR, and I've used it five time in six years. I wouldn't have paid for one."
2,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NIKON D3100 even though suggested bundle item on Amazon shopping,"If only I would have read the review and done more research.. silly me thinking it being displayed to buy (bundled deals) with the D3100 and a battery would work. Please don't make my mistake and see if it is compatible with your camera first!Did test with friends D70 and worked for about 20 shots.... as long as you were within 10 feet and in front of the camera. You get what you pay for, or maybe a little less.CD"
2,Disappointing,"Might as well use the camera timer and run into a shot. Apparently the remote system on the 5100 is completely proprietary in that we get only so many seconds per use and if we don't use the remote the camera switches back to whatever setting it had before. In other words, if there's a way to set this camera on a pod and wait for the shot to happen (like an animal coming to a den or nest, etc.) it's not going to work with this remote system. Instructions for the remote use in the camera manual are also very poor."
4,Great remote.,"It does exactly what it's supposed to do. I am occasionally restricted by being a little too far away, but it's not much of a problem. Definitely worth the money."
3,An Electronic Cable Release,"Does what it's supposed to do, but would be more useful if there was also a sensor in the back of the camera so this product would work from behind the camera as well."
3,Great idea but poor execution,"Simply put, this is a great idea with poor execution. Once you change the settings on the camera to accept the remote trigger, you need to focus one last time. Then you simply need to find the spot where the camera will see the remote. I have had to press the button a half a dozen times (with a new battery) to get the camera to fire.Not sure why this is, when it works it is great."
3,"Does fire camera, but will not initiate autofocus...","The ML-3 does release the shutter okay, at least from the front and left side of the camera. However, I want to see the image I'm about to take and a half-press of the ML-3 button does not activate autofocus. You have to half-press the shutter release on the camera then release the shutter from the remote.To be fair, it costs very little. And the delay to release seems to eliminate camera vibration completely.If you want to be able to initiate autofocus off-camera with a half-button press, you need to use one of the cable releases."
3,Better design needed,"The wireless remote works well as designed; however, the design could be improved. Notice that there is no eyelet on which to attach a tether line to the remote. A tether line would allow you to hang the remote from a tripod, much as you would a cable release. As it stands now, I have to keep reaching into my pocket for the remote and then put it away while I set up for the next shot. That gets tiresome after several dozen landscape shots."
2,Good after new battery,"Well my remote came with a dead battery, which means it didn't work out of the box of course. Once I drop the cash for a new battery it works as promised, so my rating is for the ""stale"" condition of the product, not its performance."
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this to shoot portraits of my grandchildren, hands free, behind or parallel to the camera, so they would not pay attention to the camera. But because the remote must be pointed at the front of the camera, this is difficult to impossible. Spontaneity is soooo important, and this remote does not enhance my ability to get the shot!"
3,Nikon wireless remote,"I got it for my wife as a stocking stuffer last year. It works great, only thing is we dont use it as often as i thought we would. Great product and fast delivery."
4,i still not use it,"i didn't use it yet,but it seems to be ok, the package was untouched, so it's brand new. wish that the product shows what cameras can be used for it"
1,Does not work on the Nikon D300s,"It was very disappointing to find out that the remote works on the Nikon D300, but not the D300s. Anyone need a wireless remote?"
4,Easy to Use!,"This is great! It was very simple to use (once I found a tip from another online user on HOW since there are no directions!) For anyone who is wondering...On my Nikon D50, I had to hit the ""timer"" button 3 times until the remote icon appeared without the timer icon. I would think that would be about the same on other models.I did have a little trouble getting it to trigger the shutter if I was more than 8 ft away. It worked great for doing some self-portraits!"
3,"Not the remote's fault, but...","This cute little remote works just fine. Unfortunately, most, if not all, digital Nikons can only receive the remote's signal from the front.That is great for self-portraits and occasions where you don't want to touch the camera. I wanted to activate mine from behind, to get sneak shots of the local wildlife.It has sufficient range and sometimes you can bounce the signal off a ceiling or wall, like with a TV remote. I have even used it through windows.Nikon owners should get this remote, but I wish the camera was designed so that it would work from all directions. Guilty by association, so only three stars."
4,Works with the D80 as well,This does work with the D80; you can frame your picture and then take off the eyepiece cover and put an optional cover over it and then go sit in front of the camera with the remote setting on and shoot away. It is nice to have if you would like to set up your camera in a stationary position.
1,Nikon D3100,I own one of this remote and can't get it to work on Nikon's D3100. I tried various method to get it to work and found my effort not futile.
4,NIKON ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control,Received the item very promptly. Tested the remote w/ my NIKON D50. Works well.
1,Does not work,I am disappointed that this item does not work. I suspect the battery is bad. also this item did not come with any instructions on how to use it. I was able to get instructions from the web.
4,Infrared,"You MUST be in front of the camera for the remote to work. I know that this might sound stupid but if you want to have your camera on a tripod and take pictures while standing BEHIND the camera, this is not what you are looking for (try with a shutter release cable)"
4,"It's cheap, handy, and works. Just wish it had a bit more ""range""","The title says it all. It's cheap, handy, and works! The only thing I've noticed that's a little annoying (but not a deal breaker) is that my D5000 won't recognize it unless I'm holding it in my right hand (when using it behind a tripod). The lens and/or body must be blocking the signal when I try to use this in my left hand. I don't have a left/right hand preference when using it, but it would be nice to be able to use it in either hand so that I don't have to think about it. I haven't used it for self-photos in front of the camera, only behind a tripod. I recommend this. If I lost it, I would buy it again."
4,Nikon ML-L3 Remote,"This remote is a great accessory and a must for anyone wanting to do more than set your camera on auto. It works well using it in front or in back of the camera. It comes with a great little case for protection. I think Nikon should adopt this remote trigger to all of their cameras. The only thing I don't like it it does not come with some type of lanyard or even a place to attach such a convenience. It is so small and light you could easily lose it. Overall, great product! I hope this helps."
2,Dead battery and no range,It was handy but very difficult to find the range and angle for the camera to fire. The battery only lasted 2 days. Very frustrating item.
5,Nikon Wireless Remote,"Very durable. I accidently left it in a pocket, washed it and dryed it on high. The remote survived the water, the tumbling and worked immediately after removing it from the dryer.Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control for D50 & D70 Digital SLR CamerasI have a Nikon D40 and this product works great when you are in front of the camera. If you are shooting using a tripod and you are behind the camera the sensor on the camera does not pick up the signal as well. I found I have to bounce it off something in front of the camera but that is a limitation of the camera not the remote."
4,Delay not an issue,I was wondering whether to buy this product since I wanted the functionality of at least a 2 second delay after pressing the remote. (For family self-portraits).I have the Nikon D70. It dawned on me after I bought the remote that you can set the delay in the camera itself. I've tried it with a 2 second delay and it works like a charm. (Haven't tested it with any other delay setting).
5,Tiny little thing!,"Realize this is tiny! The longest side of it is only around 2 inches. That's good though, you need to conceal it when you're framing that family portrait! The device works perfectly for what you need it to do!"
3,Good but not great,I gave this 3 stars because I just seem to always have problems with this working exactly when and how I think it should function. It is great if you are not trying to take instant photos at the push of the button. I honestly tend to give up and just set my camera to continuous timed pictures and let it run. Seems easier to delete the unwanted photos afterwards.
5,Rocks.,Very convenient when shooting pornographic art. It uses infrared so make sure you have line of sight. would buy again.
2,It was not a quality product,When it came it was not packed properly and didn't work at all.Up inspection it all seemed ok but still didn't work.Not happy at all.
5,Good product,WOW is all I can say worked great out of the box I set my camera to the remote mode and baamm. I was taking pictures just like that.
4,Push those buttons...,Works as the previous description describes it. Still using it after six months with two of my cameras. Would certainly purchase another one if I loose this one.
5,Nikon ML-L3,"This item is a ""must-have"" for the D40x I own. I purchased this as a replacement for one on a camera that was stolen. It's a Nikon product, durable, reliable and inexpensive."
1,Don't waste your money on this,It's over priced piece of plastic and doesn't work. It doesn't come with instructions and i just doesn't work. I wish id read the negative reviews before i bought this
1,Looks and sounds good but can not get it to work!,I purchased the Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control and was excited about its features. However after spending many hours studying and reviewing the instructions both on line and in the Nikon owners manual for the camera and for the remote itself I could not get the camera to recognize a signal.. Therefore I guess I wasted my investment for what was advertised as a remote for my D60 Nikon DSLR camera. Very disappointing - to say the least!!
1,Not really worth the money.,"The range, or lack thereof, that you can use this item really makes it a worthless product. You would be better off just setting the timer. Completley worthless."
1,dissatisfied,the product that was sent to me does not work. I wrote the seller twice and have not had any response from. I expect more from people who deal with Amazon. I am very put out by this.
1,Does not work!!!!!! Still waiting for a replacement,I am a Professional Photographer...I ordered this item because I really needed it for a busy Holiday season. When I contacted your customer service (they were so nice and helpful but no remote) I was told that I had ordered the wrong remote..even though the picture and description said it could be used for D50...it did not work. I had to pay to get a new one and have not received my refund for the old one. I have received a new remote I purchased to replace the first one and IT DOES NOT WORK....... I called the customer service AGAIN...and once again they were nice BUT I have been waiting now for two weeks for a replacement. Where is it......? At this time I am not happy I still have a remote that does not work....
1,Disappointed,"I like the premise of this handy little gadget; however, it doesn't work with my Nikon D-50. Can you suggest a solution?"
1,It did not work as it was described. No user's manual attached,"First of all, it did not work on D40 as it had promised. Secondly, no user's manual or guide was included, just a remoter."
1,Don't work with D60,"Nikon D60 don't recognize this remote controll. Impossible to review this product. Bought this control when i visited USA, now in Brazil and cannot return it."
2,Not happy with this unit,"Will only work from the left side of the camera and the range is very short. Must be pointed directly at(perfectly at the pick up) the camera and only from one side. Unable to trip the shutter from more then five or six feet away. Over all this was not worth the time, effort or money."
5,Works exactly as expected,No surprises.- works exactly as expected on my D90- setup a breezeOnly possible downside is use in a room where 2+ people are using the same remote. There is no camera=remote pairing (that I can see).
4,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote,"The Nikon ML-L3 is a nifty little device for taking still-pictures, or for self-inclusion in a shot (i.e., when you don't want to dash to make the picture).I'd purchased the remote to enable me to setup my camera (Nikon D80) to take pictures of our hummingbirds through our patio-doors... Unfortunately, the camera has to be facing you, or you need a reflective surface to bounce the signal to the cameras detector in order to release the shutter (oops...).Regardless, I'm quite happy with its performance, as it can transmit its signal over 30+ feet, and it comes equipped with a small pouch that can be attached to the camera strap (that way you never have to leave home without it) :)"
5,cute. easy to use,this little clicker is so cute. and so light weight it almost feels fake. but it works wonders for my nikon d40. and i love it. definet must have
4,Product Works..,"This was ordered as a Christmas gift for my daughter's camera and we received it shortly after placing the order. This was a bit surprising as it was just before Christmas. The product came with its own battery and after setting up the camera and pulling the plastic strip protecting the battery from draining in the remote control, I pushed the button and it worked perfectly the first and every time thereafter."
5,Works fine,Works just fine with my Nikon D40. No complaints other than I really think Nikon should give everyone one with camera in the first place.
4,Great did it's job!,This remote was great especially for the price. I wish that range was little longer. In all a great product and very handy.
5,Nikon quality,"Good remote, works great with my D-50. Haven't used it much yet, but it seems to function pretty well. Triggering the shutter isn't as tricky as some people make it out to be. Fine product, well worth the price."
5,Like having your own studio assistant,"This little gizmo lets me wander around the room to get the shot setup exactly like I want it, then snap the photo immediately before anything or anyone changes. It really freed me up and made my photography easier."
4,Nice Toy,"I got one. It is not expensive and it is so small that will not create you a big problem taking it with you in the backpack. My D90 has a setting especially for pictures using this remote device. The fact that it activates when aiming directly in front of the camera says it all: It is great for family portraits where you want to be included---most ""family photographers"" will appreciate having one of this cute things. It is no good for anything else. I bought me a Nikon MC-DC2 Wired Remote for my serious work.I srongly recommend it---better with it than without it."
4,Questionable,"I'm not sure if it needs a new battery or not but this does not fire the camera every time I click the button, it's quite annoying at times. Other than that it's very easy to use and when it works it gets the job done. No more really to say it works when it wants to at this point, but then again I can not confirm until I put a brand new battery into it."
2,Nikon Wireless Remote Control,"While it is convenient to prevent camera shake at lower shutter speeds, it is not always reliable since it doesn't want to work all the time."
5,Nikon ML-L3,Pros:Works great with my Nikon D5000. Fantastic range and built to last!Cons:Doesn't come with free Nikon Micro lens. :)
5,Spot On Remote!,"I purchased this for my D5000 to help me with self portraits and photos with friends. Simple to use, easy to conceal, spot on response. A great remote!....A+++"
5,ML-L3 Remote,"This was bought for my Nikon D5000, and it works great out the tiny little box. You need to remove the plastic off the battery then then change the cameras release mode setting in the menu. Take a picture. Done. This does autofocus as well. It is about as long as a womans index finger and does what it says it will do."
1,please dont,Neaver get this because no manuel comes with it bad quality and dosnt even work lastly it took a week to ship to il
1,not working,"I tried this in all three modes, nothing worked.Would have rated ""no stars"" but it wouldn't let me."
1,Didn't even work,"I don't know what the deal is. I got it. About a month later, I pulled the clear battery strip out and tried it and it just didn't work. Unfortunately I tried it too late to send it back and get a refund."
1,never received the item,"I never received the item, the postal service and your company just blew me off, I am telling every one I know to never order from you any more."
1,"Piece of junk, but its your only choice","Typical of Nikon accessories: overpriced. Wish there were a ""high power"" version capable of reaching more than a couple feet in daylight."
2,free shipping?,"When I bought this item,it said I am eligible for the free shipping, but I don't know why it still charges me some extra money"
3,no vibration,"The Nikon ML-l3 wireless remote performs wonderfuly. I use a very light tripod and this wonderful little device has all but eleminated vibration when using telephoto lenses. Just wish it had more range, and the ability to function from behind the camera as well as the front."
3,Doesn't Measure Up to the Promises,"This remote is okay, but it does NOT work from 16 feet away [at least in my experience...perhaps it's the battery ;-) ]. But if you want to do time/delayed exposures with yourNikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR Nikkor Zoom Lens""D"" series cameras, you'll need one...and I do so for my night photography."
3,NiKon wireless remote,Remote works if held in front of the camera - will not work from behind. You also have to set-up the remote sensing in the camera's memory before you can use the remote - it will return to default setting wehen the camera is shut off. Otherwise the remote works fine.
4,"Great, but, cannot use it from behind the camera","This is a great product. I love using it, and while visiting people I hand it over to others while taking group pictures. Everybody at parties and get-together love using it.I would have given it a five star, except that for the fact that it cannot be used from behind the camera. That would be great for macro work, animal photography and so on."
5,Good product,It does what it suppose to do. A lot cheaper compare to buying from Nikon. I'd recommend to a friend.
1,Second Disappointing Order,"This is the second of the same remote I have bought. The first one did not work past 5 or 6 feet, which was the whole reason for purchasing, to take shots from farther away. After changing the battery and trying with a different camera, it was still not working. To give the product and a seller the benefit of the doubt, I ordered another one with the same disappointing result.I'd like to ask the seller for any tips on how to get this remote to work farther than 5 feet away from the camera. If not, I unfortunately will be returning the item."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"Worked without fail, works every time great. Easy to conceal for self portraits, and fun to use. I found that when I first got it I used it even when I didn't really need to!"
5,Great,This product works like it should. It's great to have when taking self portraits or when there is no one around to take a picture for you.
4,Good product,"I had my remote working and ready to go within 5 minutes of opening the package. All it took for my Nikon D60 was changing the shutter release setting to remote control immediate release. Some people said that it wouldn't work from behind the camera, but mine does as long as you're close enough. In front of the camera, it works good as well.. I just wish it had a little longer range. Anything over about 5-10 feet and it will not work. Overall, I'm glad I purchased it.. a great addition to my acessories, and I'd still purchase it again knowing what I know now."
4,Remote Control,I am very happy with this product and with the speed in which it was shipped and received.
5,Remote Functions as advertised,The product worked as specified... Thanks. The case looks cheap and should be of better quality.
4,Great Little Remote,I have used this remote with my Nikon D80 for about a year. I has worked flawlessly for group photos and tripod shots. The range is decent. I have taken photos up to 12' away. It is compact and comes with a canvass sleeve/case that you can attach and store on your camera strap. I would recommend it to everyone. Who hasn't needed a wireless remote for their camera at some point? I only wish it came with the camera bodies. It should be an included accessory!
1,Dosen't work with my camera as advertized,This remote does not work with the NIKON D3100 as advertized. How do I return and purchase the correct remote shutter release?
5,Nikon ML-L3 remote control,"I bought this remote to use it with my D7000 and it works perfect, it's small, works exactly when you need it and it's very reliable (from my experience).Definetly A+ for me."
4,"Perfect, except for...","Product arrived in perfect condition. All in the original packaging and what not. The only problem was the battery that came with the remote was not working. I ensured the plastic safety strip was removed and still the remote wouldn't work so...I do hope when I get a new battery, it works."
5,Does what it is supposed to.,No problems at all with my D40 and D90. Haven't really tried anything at a far distance but it works great in close.
4,Good Enough,"It`s good for me, just practice a while and you can get a lot of things, in bulb mode, you just need to press once to begin your exposition and once to close."
5,Useful in so many ways!,"I love this thing! With this thing, I don't always have to be the one stuck behind the camera. I've bought two of these. My first one broke just recently because I dropped it a lot. It's a great product that not only lets the photographer join in the picture, but it also helps you get sharp photos. When you use the remote, you don't press the shutter, so you shake the camera less and the photos are sharper. It's also cheap! Because of this, I recommend you get this if you have any of the compatible Nikon cameras."
4,Nikon ML-L3 Wireless RC,"Very satisfied and it works as expected on my D60 - whether you are in front or away from the back of the camera. Easy to use, just set your D60 to use the remote instead of the shutter release button and shoot."
4,works great,"Inexpensive, small, convenient. Indispensable. Does what its suppposed to and does it well."
4,Buy this at Retail Store,Remote works as described but I found it at my local specialty camera store for $18.50 + tax. I would look locally first.
4,Remote control,Very useful feature and accessory for my camera (Nikon D50). The wireless remote came in a very timely manner. I've been using it since I received it in the mail.Only wish it had a longer range.
4,nikon wireless remote,MY DAUGHTER SENT ME THE LINK I ORDERED IT AND IT WAS HEAR WITHIN 3 DAYS. CAN'T ASK FOR MORE THEN THAT.
1,Nikon ML-L3,Using w/ D90 - Not real happy - have to be on the side of the camera vs behind it - no documentation received with device. Wastrying to use to shoot birds on feeders - camera shuts down after 15 mins and then you must reset camera to use the remote. Maybe a different use would work
3,Can only be used while facing the camera,The remote is effecient but it's negative side is that it can only be used while facing the camera. Which means you can't use it while hiding from wild life.
2,Maybe it was just mine,but it worked fine for maybe a day then i thought maybe the batterys been there too long so i bought a new one. it takes forever for it to actually take the picture and no it's not on timer. plus i'd have to restart my camera a million times to only to get it to work sometimes. ugh
3,could be better,"Once you set up your camera for remote, make sure you dont go back and try to take a shot using the camera button, it takes it out of remote mode (D80). Why cant they both work in unison? I dont know. Aside from that small issue, works as expected, first press is focus, second is shutter. They could have implemented a two stage button to have some sort of consistancy, but they chose to keep the remote slim."
5,Great Remote Control,"This is an amazing remote control. I've only used it once thus far - to take a picture of my bedroom wall to make sure it works - but boy did it work! Its ease of use is stunning - just press the button and the camera shutter releases! And unlike other remotes I've used, with a myriad of confusing buttons and controls and lots of tiny writing that I can hardly make out, this remote has just a single, large, easy to press button.The design is elegant and functional. Bravo, Nikon!"
2,Not so much,I'm a Nikon fan--but I find this product sub-par. Does not work in sweet light/sunset for portrait shooting. I ended up using the timer and running back and forth for pics of my family. It does work inside if you point the remote directly at the camera and rush to get your hand down for a natural pose. Nikon can do better than this. I'd rather chip in some more cash for some extra juice on the power needed for this remote.
2,Disappointment,"Hello,Nikon's ML-L3 is poorly built and does not preform consistently. You would think one would only have to push the button and the camera would take a picture, but it does not happen that way. With the camera set properly for remote control, the unit makes the camera fire only 50% of the time. It will not work behind the camera (for macro work) that is why Nikon added a cable release on the new D70s. I am told the following remotes will work on the D70. You can find them here at: [...]. I have not tried them myself but have it on reliable information that they preform better than the ML-L3.A person does not have much of a choice when it comes to buying a remote for the D70 and for the life of me I cannot understand why Nikon would sell such a cheap and disappointing piece of junk. When consumers accept such poor quality in workmanship and function it lowers the quality bar one more notch.Thanks,Bill"
2,Okay product,It works great when you are in front of the camera but not so well behind it. my problem with it is that it will ONLY TAKE UP TO A 30 MIN EXPOSURE! so star trails wont really work that great...
5,The Nikon ML-L3 Digital Camera Remote,"If you want vibration free tripod shots, this remote is a MUST.As most photographers know, tripping the shutter on a tripod mounted camera canproduce unwanted vibrations. With this remote, that is no longer a problem.Set the camera for a 10 second release, press the remote button from in frontof the camera and just walk out of the field of view.For those Blue Hour photographers with a Nikon DSLR, this will be your best friend."
3,Good for close pictures,"If you and your partner or friends want to take a picture of the all group together, this could be a good tool (just remember to set the camera to work with remote control AND timer, so you don't show up in every picture like you are changing the tv channel).Its range is the only real problem, since it doesn't work if you are very far from the camera (lets say something like 10ft) or if your are not exactly in front of it...In order to resume the story, I'd say that this is a good INDOORS product."
1,Non-compatable d3100 nikon,This remote is not compatable with the Nikon D3100. Review your tech manual prior to purchasing. The site might say it's compatable but it not with the Nikon D3100.
5,Should be included,"This accessory should be part of the whole package when shipped to the consumer. It works as well as advertised. But do not forget to ready the camera for the IR signal. Otherwise, you will push the button and nothing will happen."
3,Must-Have accessory but it should have been standard issue,"The remote works as intended, though oddly Nikon didn't bother putting a sensor usable from the back of the camera. Nonetheless, this little remote is worth the $13. I believe Nikon should have included it with the camera, though, as small and as cheap as it is.NOTE: Get it *directly* from Amazon and *NOT* from Eek Technology, or any other vendor as their shipping is a monstrosity. The box the remote comes in is about the size of a pocket matchbox or a Zippo lighter, and doesn't weigh a full ounce. The remote itself is very small, smaller than most car alarm keychains. Paying more than a couple of dollars for shipping is asinine. DBROTH charges $8 to ship this and Eek Technologies hits you hard at $12 to ship this miniscule item."
3,Handi...,I like the product only if there was instruction on how to sync the product with the camera that I have which is D3100.
3,Wireless Remote Control,"I purchased this for my son's Nikon D7000. Although he is using remote occasionally, being small and cheap, justifies this purchase of the Nikon ML-L3 Wireless Remote Control."
1,Didn't work at all.,"And of course, I waited so long to test it that it's too late to send it back. What a waste.(FYI: I was attempting to use it with a Nikon D60.)"
5,Good but needs trueVGA,"This item is great. My only complain it that the start menu bar and the bar at the bottom of the screen are too large. ozVGA and other trueVGA utilities fix this, though, though not entirely without new problems. I highly recommend it, though you might want to look at the other Pocket PC's that have the newer Intel processor.These can be upgraded to have 128MB RAM, and you can even upgrade it to Windows Mobile 6, if you look hard enough."
5,Works excellent with GPRS,"I have a Sony Ericcson W300 and it works great with the Internet GPRS connection using the Bluetooth.The Axim is great, worth the price!"
5,excellent product,"This is a gr8 product. You want go wrong in purchasing this product. Wonderful screen (VGA), and it works excellent."
3,Quality device but....,"This PDA appears to be a quality piece of hardware but the software has bugs that you have to figure out on your own, through aximsite.com. I spent a lot of time ""fixing"" a brand new, expensive piece of equipment and at this point I'm majorly annoyed. The two ""fixes"" include disabling the automatic activesync that comes installed on the device and installing a program called memmaid that cleans up a notification from Odyessy Client that seriously delays start up. If you buy the Axim, fix the bugs immediately and you will probably be happy. But, don't look to Dell for help."
1,Dont do it!,"I have wanted to smash this with a hammer many times. I've done many of the fixes from various websites and had some lessening of frustration, but what remains is still great. Hang & crash ALL THE TIME! 2 or 3 times per day!"
1,BEWARE - Stay away from Dell.,"Dell sent me not one but three of these Axims, until I received one that worked properly...for a few months. After numerous calls to people I could barely understand (After 14 calls in 3 months I gave up), an obsurd amount of visits to their website (their web based support equals intense stress) I decided it's not worth the heartache to fight Dell to fix it or supply a 4th one that might work. I also see on Craigslist many new Dell products people are trying to unload, including many laptops and Axims, no surprise here. Their customer service is deplorable, bar none."
1,Caveat Emptor,"My Axim worked extremely well for three weeks until a one pixel line suddenly appeared vertically down the center of the display. Just to note, I'm really careful with all my gadgets and the unit was never dropped or misused/abused. This line on the display did not disappear so I decided to call customer service. I've spent countless of hours on the phone getting bounced around and having numerous 'case numbers' assigned to me. Three months later I do not have a replacement for the faulty Axim. Of course there are a lot of pros with this product and all of them have been covered by other reviewers. However, beware if something goes wrong with your Axim and you need to contact tech or customer support in India."
5,Awesome Product,"This Pocket PC is really good, I use it to do my powerpoint presentations, I can use pocket word, acrobat reader, pocket excel and pocket powerpoint. I can watch divx, mpeg, avi and wav movies, and hear my mp3's. I can even watch jpeg's at the same time, because it has multitask capabilities. It also has two card readers (SD and SD), so your capacity con go up to 12 GB in total. It wireless capabilities are very good also. You can find all kinds of cool software at low prices. Please note that you can just plug a little cable, and that cable to an external monitor/projector and voila!!, everything on the pocket pc screen will be seen in the projector. The processor speed will go down a little bit.If you are a Pro, you need this, if you are a student, you need this too."
2,Design flaws mar otherwise nice device,"I really like this pda, but due to some irritating design flaws, I can't recommend it. The buttons can be too easily pressed accidentally. You need to be really careful how you grasp it when you remove it from it's cradle or you will activate things that you don't wish to. I've had Palm pda's for years and never had this issue. Also, Dell (apparently) wants a monopoly on all it's parts, so you can't even purchase an extra stylus in an office supply store. Switching the battery seems to result in a soft reset."
3,Good device that crashes a lot!,"This uses the the Mobile 5 operating system and the new version of the Active sync. 4.1. Unfortunately the system is not very stable and crashes a lot. I can not recommend this purchase until microsoft and Dell fix the bugs.It is fast and is great when it works, but has a lot of problems. Here is a short list of the most critical issues:- the battery lasts only 2 days (without using it) if you have an SD card plugged in- crashes a lot and the soft reboot button has to be used to turn it on- the new version of Activesync (4.1) uses TCP/IP stack and this has made it incompatible with many systems, where version 3.8 worked just fine. Unfortunately it is not backward compatible with the old version.----------------Someone stole this from me. It was as if they gave me my life back. One of the best things to happen to me. Using the Palm 700p and am much happier."
5,Spellbinding!,"I have never read any of Cherrhy's Merchanter Series. However thanks to Cherryh's detailed and absorbing story telling, this handicap does not deter me from enjoying Finity's End. There is no over the tops space battle or fight to the end scenes in Finity's End. Finity End is about a young man's struggle to find himself, male bonding and meanings of the words ""family"" and ""peace"". All this is told against an intelligently conceived universe where men seems to have conquer all the stars and, sadly, sharing this large universe with only one other type of living being besides himself. Finity's End is one of Cherryh's best even though the ending needs finer editing. Thank you Cherryh for such a beautifully written and compelling story."
2,"readable, but not among Cherryh's best","In a review the expression 'adolescent angst' is used, and if you are interested in reading once more all about it, Finity's End can be recommended. I was disappointed, because I have come to expect more from Cherryh."
2,Come on this could be better!!!,The story is well so-so. It just seemed dead to me. The cover suggests to me action packed with extreme moments. This was my first book by her. I wasn't very impressed now i don't know if she has better books haven't read them. This book just seemed boring to me but the cover and illustrarions were good. The book could've been better and if she puts a little more feeling in it and more action it would be great in my eyes.That's my opinion on the book.
5,Cherryh Has Few Equals,"Just read for the third time (in 10-year period) and enjoyed as much as the first two times. The plot is tight, the characters and vivid."
3,Decent Story -- Poor editing,"The typical Cherryh Mercanter novel. Good stories about people, technology is never a big part of the story. The main problem I had with this book was the poor editing. Room numbers change in different places, characters are mentioned as part of a group then disappear. Certain events appear out of order.The book doesn't really stand alone. Without prior knowledge of the series, this book would be confusing."
2,overly simplistic and dated,I was looking for greater technical information with modern 12VDC mobile power systems. I would not reccomend this for anyone looking beyond the basics.
4,High Society,I had previously owned this CD and had it stolen. The purchase was to replace a stolen item that I liked.
4,good insight,"Although, I didn't always agree with what the author has to say - I did find this book to be insightful."
5,Fire Service Personnel Management,This item was delivered as stated. Book was in new condition and was delivered in the time frame noted. I have placed several book orders through Amazon.com and have not been disappointed. I will and have recommended to friends for their book needs.
1,Would not recommend,Required reading for a promotional exam and was extremely dissapointed. This book is poorly written and is difficult to understand the main theme/points the author is trying to convey.Mr. Edwards creates a lot of drummed up academia buzz words that offer little real world application.
2,Fire Service Personnel Management (2nd Edition),If your looking to become the Fire Chief this book is for you. There is very little good for line officers.
1,"Nice watch, get's ruined after a month","The watch is great, however the case and band get scratched really easy. I would not recommend you wear this watch normally. I had mine for 3 months, looks like i had it for 20 years. It has some scratches on the dial, which i don't have a clue how that happened. Also today the band broke in 2 places, never spent so much on a watch and had these problems. I will contact citizen to see if they will replace it under warranty."
4,"THE NANNY... FUNNY, FRIENDLY, FAST","A warm story about a small town girl with big time dreams. Jo, the main protagonist is your quintessential girl next door, with a laid back boyfriend, relatable parents and friends she has grown up with. She knows she wants something more out of life and when the chance comes, she grabs it. In London she is a nanny to a crazy bunch of kids, and almost seems to be parenting the parents at times. How she adapts, finds love, finds her groove....is what this story is all about. A warm, bedside read on days when you want pop fantasy instead of the reality of a cold morning."
3,Bad Title- Good Book,"The bland title of this book almost put me off from buying it!! This book is much more than a ""nanny"" story...I started this book thinking I was going to be reading a knock-off of ""The Nanny Diaries""-- a story about bratty children, an unbearable boss, etc...and the back cover actually leads one to belive this.However, this book is none of the above! This was a real story..not just about one character, but about many. The reader gets to know the ins and outs of several characters throughout the book, thus making it a very complete and satisfying read.The toilet humor I could have done without, though-- there seemed to be no point to it other than a lame, unsuccessful attempt at creating a laugh or two.This book was a find....easily passed by due the title- I am happy I stumbled upon this one!"
3,Light and fun (3 1/2 stars)!,"The Nanny is the perfect light read. You'll enjoy Jo Green's struggles with the Fitzgeralds. She moves from the countryside to London to look after Zak, Cassie and Tallulah. But she ends up babysitting the parents as well. After all, Vanessa and Dick give a whole new meaning to the word dysfunctional. To make matters worse, Jo has a crush on Josh -- Dick's son from his previous marriage. She cannot ignore the fact that she has a boyfriend back home -- or could she? The Nanny is pure fun. Very entertaining. I recommend this cute, quick read."
2,Disappointing,"I actually bought this book. I wasted money on this book! I read it and thought it was one of the stupidest books i'd ever read. The characters were not memorable and the plot just went on and on, not gathering speed or interest along the way. The writing isnt very great either and i was surprised that this book was on the top ten bestsellers list. It's really quite bad actually, and i wouldnt reccommend it to anyone."
1,Not so good...,"I thought it would be interesting from the book description, but, turns out it's not. I didn't like this story because...I just didn't seem to take to the characters. I even disliked the main character. They were dull, and I disliked their personalities."
4,Love Ella CD,Great CD of original Ella recordings. Good quality and the cuts are the ones that other people sang on the PBS salute to Ella.
3,a bit disappointed,i was expecting a little better quality but to make things worse the item was all streched out of proportion due to the paper insert that was not placed properly.
3,pretty good,pretty good just makes the phone so bulky i ended up ripping it in my pants pocket. was pretty good for the while i had it though its recommended i think i'm gonna pick up another one.
5,Perfect Fit,"This silicone skin case fits my N95 perfectly, shipment from Eforcity was quick and well packaged, would like to deal with again."
5,Oreida steak knives,"These are the perfect steak knives and really cut! I purchased them to go with my Aquarius set, that is not the satin finish, and they look great with it. Price at Amazon was much more reasonable then others I looked at."
4,I was there,"I really liked this documentary, but I am biased since I lived in Cocoa Beach from 1966 to 1970. My father was one of the thousands of engineers who worked on the Apollo Program. In fact I am a member of the high school class that Nancy interviewed during its 10-year reunion.Our fathers dragged us to Cocoa Beach from all over the country in a rush to be a part of the space program. Immediately after Apollo 11, the layoffs started and most of us scattered back from whence we came. But the experience was unique and unforgettable.This documentary gives an accurate view of what it was like to be a part of the space race. It showed the highs, the lows, the excitement, a brief look at the hidden price of its success (broken dreams and lives) and the bittersweet ending.If you remember watching the early Mercury Flights on a flickering Black and White TV in your school classroom, this documentary is for you."
5,Classic,"This book is a well-written classic. Unfortunately, it's starting to show it's age: The trails have changed a little bit. The trails are no longer exactly as this book describes. Nonetheless, a pretty good bike for mountain biking LA county, especially in the Pasadena area. I wish the author would create an updated version."
5,beyond awesome,"I just received my tub of miracle reds...i mixed it with water and my emergen-c vitamin pack...my goodness....the taste is freaking awesome. I just hope that it was ok to mix it with the vitamin C.....as soon as I got the tub I opened it and tasted the raw powder....it's actually very very good...loved it...will definitely be ordering again...I am from trinidad btw so I have it delivered to my skybox then it comes to me so i would be paying even more...but believe me when I say it's worth it. Felt great after too..I'm a busy single mother, trying to work out on a regular basis (presently doing Les Mills Combat) so this comes in very handed...I should have waited till after my workout this evening to have this but just couldn't wait."
2,Taste not so great :-(,"After reading all the positive reviews I decided to try it. Omg....it taste like dirt. I was so dissapointed! I mixed it with 8oz water with a splash of apple juice like it said to. Eww...I have got to find a better way to mix it! Since this product is soo good for the body, I will continue to take it and see if I notice a difference. I want to feel better mentally and physically."
1,Cannot sleep - Green Tea?,"It appears this product has caffeine in it as it has Green Tea (60% Polyphenols, 40% Catechins) and I notice myself urinating more frequently and feeling jittery. Pretty sure if the company was using decaffeinated Green Tea then the ingredients label would say so.Does anybody else have information on this?"
2,I feel cheated. I purchased this at whole foods and it was less than 1/3 filled.,"I purchased this product after it was recomended from a whole food store associate. i liked the flavor mixed with water, (my very own vitamin water). However, the package is misleading; it was less than 1/3 filled. What a waste of plastic and money. For that price, i won't be buying again."
1,George is God; eveyone else sucks (especially the Beatles Clapton & the Stones),"This is not a professional publication; it's someone's personal essay. The author has the unique viewpoint that everyone else, and I mean everyone else, is terrible. I am an avid Bealtes fan with George my favorite and I deeply regret the $$$ and time spent on this so called mystical book. Mystical it ain't."
1,Cosmo Virtual Makeover is a Virtual waste of $$$,"There is no Makeover, it sends you to another website where you have to pay $40 or more and plus, that website doesnt even work! All in all, I was very disappointed! Dont waste your $ or time!"
1,False Ad Poor Service,"This is not deluxe as advertised but a sampler and will not work on windows xp. It says on the case for windows 97...When tried to use for the first time said it wouldn't play, error messages, not for windows xp as asvertised, and their customer compaint online limits you to 200 words/spaces. They sent the same exact item. This time i found a phone number. Could hardly understand the operator. As soon as he looked at picture and what I was saying, he said Oh yea I'll have to tell them about this, that was a week ago, (Did email a ten dollar certificate as if I would trust them to order anything else). Picture or ad has still not been changed and I'm still awaiting refund. This was my first and last dealing with Amazon. I think it is a bait and switch ploy because most people won't follow up on it."
4,Works well,"Well made. Works as advertised. Be sure to practice before doing 'serious' mats. View the Logan tutorial videos. The hardest part is adjusting blade depth with cutting start and stop points. These change as mat thickness changes, and is applicable to all mat cutters."
5,Perfect Mats - Every Time,"I owned a less expensive mat cutter. It was a waste of money. I almost always had to recut the mat. Not so with the Logan SimplexPlus. Every mat I have cut, and I have cut several, were perfect the first time. No frustration, no foul language, and no redo's."
3,ADULT XXX To much for me.,As always it was written in Kathleen O'Neal Gear's great style but this whole 'Black Falcon Trilogy' was too violent with torture and terror detail for my enjoyment.
5,Nice dot to dot book for the youngest counters,"This is a surprisingly nice dot-to-dot book for the youngest counters. Unlike supermarket activity books, this one is printed on nice white thick paper. There are 64 pictures in all. The first 32 pictures use only the numbers from 1 to 10. The last 32 pictures go to 20. Across the top of each pair of pages there is a number line to help kids remember the counting sequence. This is a nice book overall."
4,Good live,"I don't know why you call this garbage, from just listening to the samples im amazed, the quality of this is really good to so dont be fooled by the poor quality of cdnow.com, I think this canadian is just jealous cause he's never going to see them live, because f&#! canada thats why. Don't let any of these people tell you how this album is, just listen to the samples and beware who you buy them from."
5,Good Metal has not died!!,"After surroidng myself with old recordings of Iron Maiden, Manowar, Saxon, Fates Warning and the like, because the new ""metal"" music just doesn't cut it anymore, it is nice to hear bands like Kamelot. This CD, which is the only one from Kamelot that I have (form the time being) is loaded with good live performances, which shownot only the musicianship of the Kamelot members but also a more importante thing: GOOD METAL STILL EXISTS!!.In can only say that I recomend this to all of you who are looking for music above the average!!"
2,"Not as good as ""Forever Green""","I bought this CD because I loved ""Forever Green"" in the same series. I was very disappointed in this one. If you like Irish jigs, it's a great CD. I do like them, but in moderation. When played one right after another, as on this album, they quickly get on your nerves. This CD was not worth the purchase price. If you want a good variety of music, buy ""Forever Green""."
5,Dance away!,"This is a fantastic cd full of high energy jigs and the like. Excellent for practicing step dancing or for stepping up your energy when doing chores around the house. It's especially appropriate around St. Patrick's Day, but the music is good enough to listen to all year long."
4,Crossroads by Matt Arnold,"I have the pleasure of working this author as a fellow para-educator in the public school system.The beginning of the book with a death bed confession from his mother sparked a rollercoaster of events that leads him to find the answer(s) to his mom's confession.It kept my interest peaked as I was wanted to know what the truth was and had to keep reading to find out. Also, this is an easy for high school age through adulthood."
4,Great guy book,"Talyor Weir responds to the life around him in interesting ways.Life has delt him some tough cards (loss of parents, broken home), and actually some very enabling support (insurance, wonderful girl friend).He was drifting through life based on these experiences, and then discovers a very basic fact that he'd formed his life around was not true.Pick up the book and share the ride with him as he works through events. The book reminds me a bit of ""Sweet Thursday"" by John Steinbeck."
1,More research and less supposition needed.,"The infamy of Ivan The Terrible has lasted for centuries but if you are looking for insight into this tyrant's reign of terror I would suggest you look elsewhere. The author generally replaces supposition for research and this becomes a boring collection of Ivan's deprivations, without a solid historical context. Yes, the man was a horrific figure, but without a better sense of time and place, there is no understanding of the man and what motivated him. I gleaned more information from the book's chronology then I did from the text. A failure as a biography, but could be used as the basis for a horror movie."
3,Not as good as hoped,"I'd like to have heard the tale in Beatrice's words instead of a third party. The story is better told in the Heifer International gift catalog. It's written for about 3rd grade level and not emotional or touching, just a statement of facts."
5,Wonderful book,"My 5 year old adores this book. On one level, it is a charming story of a girl who loves her goat. But while my daughter is being entertained, she is also learning about life in a different culture and about the power of giving in a way that helps a person help oneself."
3,Everyone can make a difference.,Beatrice's Goat is a great way to introduce children to the golden rule: Treat others as you would like to be treated.Everyone with even a little gift can make a huge difference in the lives of many people. I highly recommend this book to parents and teachers!
3,Beatrice's Goat,"Perfect, I had been looking for this book for a while and here it is. Good condition and a great price."
5,A good book that makes you want to donate.,"This book was read to my daughter's kindergarten class, then we went out and borrowed it from the school library. After reading it, I thought it was just the thing for my daughter's birthday. We are very hapoy with it; it personalizes a Heifer Project story of how giving perpetuates and how much a medium to small change cna make in someone's life. If you know any child who values edu cation or is aware of Heifer project, buy this book."
4,Great starter for giving,"This book was a great starter for the pre-school I work at. We read this book and then talked about how all of us could help other children have a better life. This all worked into giving change (pennies from our piggy banks or change in the seat cushions!) to go towards buying a goat, chickens, ducks, bees through Heifer International that works with people all over the world to improve their lives...one goat at a time!"
3,Kat's Kritique,"This is a wonderful little book that highlights the Heifer International Program. I purchased twelve copies to give to participants in a children's sermon at my church. The sermon dealt with sharing our many blessings with those in the world who are less fortunate.My one disappointment with this book was the comments by Hillary Clinton on the cover. I work hard at keeping my politics separate from my church, and I was shocked and appalled that a story about this wonderful program was contaminated in this manner. I never would have purchased the book for this purpose had I known."
2,Very Short Case - Be Careful !,"You would think that the description ""Electric Guitar Case"" infers that it fits most electric guitars - it does not. This case is VERY SHORT. I highly recommend checking this review section to see what guitars people are actually able to fit in this case. My ESP LTD did not even come close."
5,3/4 Size case!!!!,"My inexperience with guitars shows when I didn't realize by dimensions that this is a 3/4 size case, the tag on it clearly states that though the ad does not. I have to say that is my bad & if my AXL Marquee El Dorado doesn't fit when it arrives, I have every confidence Amazon will make it right. That said this is a very well made & appointed case that I bought at a lower than fair price. I can't subtract any points for my mistake, though had they stated 3/4 anywhere in the ad or description, it could have prevented my mistake."
2,Mom of two,This seat is fine but the strap is difficult to use and does not secure itself to the seat very well. I would most likely not recommend this to a friend.
2,Not safe,"We got this for our 21 month old daughter. It has no lap belt so she thinks it is fun to try to get out of while eating or sliding down to get stuck in between it and the table, oh and standing on top of it too. I do not recommend unless your child sits perfectly still the entire time they eat."
3,Just ordered--fyi,"I only gave this 3 stars because I just placed an order and haven't gotten it yet!I just wanted to give any perspective buyer an FYI. Based on the reviews about the slits and having no seatbelt I emailed BabyBjorn. Supposedly the seat didn't pass FDA approval with the seatbelt, so it is not sold with it in the US or Canada....but I guess the didn't bother to change the design for removing the slits!"
4,Motorola Mobile Phone Tools 4.0 purchase,"arrived and operates as expected - purchased at a very good, low price"
1,Not for all Motorolas,I just recieved this the other day.. was so excited to get it.. and I cant use it with the Razor I have. It doesnt recognize the phone :( Im not sure if it is the disc.. or my phone provider having some kind of block on the phone.
3,Under the radar,"Boz Scaggs / Hits! : I always enjoyed his songs when they came on the radio but he never caused enough interest to make me want one of his albums. Years later, I bought this Hits album and my feelings have not changed much. This is a pleasant CD but it doesn't cause much excitement, and I still enjoy those few hits that made the radio. Three Stars (3 )"
2,Overdubbed,"all is good till you get to heart of mine, then it distorts because of the way to high recorded volume level of the disc."
5,Every dSLR needs one!,"If you are serious in any fashion in photography, you seriously need a cable release. Whether it is this one or a different one, you need a cable release. This one was simple and easy to use on the Nikon D200. Plug and play practically. No battery required, no special instruction required. The only thing is it would be nice to be a bit cheaper. But neitherless, was helpful on numerous occassion"
2,Needs better rubber covering,"I've owned 2-3 of these cable releases. They work fine...but the rubber cable cover on the camera end weakens with usage, causing the cable to bend and exposing the wires. Once that happens, the cable can misfire just by moving the camera. This release needs a stronger rubber covering on the end that attaches to the camera. Other photographers have also complained about the same defect."
5,Outstanding; buy it despite the price,"Yes, it's overpriced, but it's way better than a $16 cord I bought here, which I returned and then bought this one.Issues: The cheap cord's screw-in collar would not screw into my D700 no matter how hard I tried, although it did screw into the D200. The Nikon cord screwed easily in. The cheap cord is tightly coiled, which means it won't extend to anything close to its advertised length; the Nikon cord is straight. Finally, the cheap cord has a very flimsy switch with an uncertain initial position; the Nikon has a solid switch that with a solid feel.Electrically, the cheap cord seemed to work OK. No idea if it would hold up with use.So, I strongly recommend spending the money for the Nikon MC-30. Yeah, it should be $20 instead of $70 or whatever, but if that's what you have to pay to get a cord that works, then so be it."
5,A must for night photos!,"I have been debating this purchase and am so pleased with the product. It works wonderfully and has made night photos a breeze. Well worth the price, you get what you pay for."
2,Disappointed Loyal Nikon Owner,"I have had several Nikon bodies and several Nikkor lenses. I've been very pleased with all things Nikon. The MC30 is the only exception, and for several reasons:1 - Cost. Though Nikon products are expensive, they're usually worth it.2 - Connection. The MC30 is a nuisance to thread on the body (currently, my D700). This may in part be due to the location on the body, but a longer connecting piece and larger knob would be in order. It is particularly difficult in cold weather when your fingers are freezing.3 - Durability. The cord separated from the connecting portion - perhaps due to 2 above.On the positive side, the MC30 works and doesn't require batteries. I just expected it to last more than a few uses."
4,Actually worth the cost?,"I recently upgraded from a Nikon D100 to a D700 and was shocked to see that my fancy new camera does not accept a mechanical shutter release. I do a lot of close-up and long exposure work, so I consider a shutter release very important. I tried to get by on the cheap with a $10 third party substitute for the Nikon MC30, but it fell apart after only a couple of days of light shooting. So, with gritted teeth, I parted with $60 for this model. It is heavy duty, with a solid feel and sure action. This baby is the way to go if you need one. Is it actually worth the cost? For $60 there really should be more to it, like an interval timer or LED flashlight. However, it is a simple, heavy duty mechanical swith, no batteries required, that should last a lifetime."
3,"Works great, excellent construction, but almost $60?","I wish Amazon had an attribute to rate Value. Almost everything about this shutter release cable is well done. The button feels solid, it's very ergonomic, and the threaded connector instills confidence that the cable won't inadvertently become unplugged. My only gripe about the cable is it's too short. Two and half feet is just shy of being long enough. A four foot cord would be perfect. The only option is to buy this release cable, then get Nikon's MC-21 extension cord. The extension and remote cable hooked together makes it too long since the extension cord is 10 feet, for a combined total of over 12 feet of cord.Last thing I am very unsatisfied with is the price. Almost $60 for a button on a cord is nothing short of ridiculous. This probably costs Nikon about $8 in parts, and that's being aggressive in my estimation. I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't been for the insane price. This item should cost no more than $20."
4,Nikon MC-30 Remote Cable Release,"This is an excellent cable release for the D300. I find it to be invaluable, especially when using ""Mirror Lock-up."" Macro work is improved significantly with a cable release."
1,Apparent Nikon Knock-off,"I have used an MC-30 almost every day for 2 yrs. We severed the cable and had to order a new one here. This new one lasted less than 2 days before it began miss-firing. Then we saw the neck behind the nut (that affixes to the body) was cracked. Wires exposed.On comparison with my old one, it's clear they are two different products. My old good one say made in Japan. Its not a plastic connector, its a sturdy rubber-like material that can be flexed a small amount. The latest one is hard plastic and says made in China. Given any tug or torque on the cable is going to 'wrench' this joint, it's clear why the plastic cracked, and a rubber casing offers the sufficient amount of stress relief to keep the cable alive for a significantly longer period.Not too long ago the guys at fstopers dot com posted a similar review about a Nikon grip [...]. I guess Amazon doesnt care, and I didnt pay enough attention."
1,Quit working after a couple of years,"I've had the MC-30 for 2.5 years. It worked fine for a year or so, then the release stage (full press) started behaving erratically. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. It got worse and worse, and now it doesn't work at all. I make thousands of photos, I know my camera well, this is clearly a quality issue with the MC-30. I spent the last couple of years in a tropical country with high humidity, at the seaside. Just to make it perfectly clear - it never came close to water, let alone be in contact. I'm talking humid atmosphere here. Think Florida. Corrosion was the commonplace for low-quality products, but I would expect an expensive Nikon piece to just work. I was in the tropics, not in Hell."
2,Save Your Money,"This is, quite simply, an unvarnished Nikon rip-off. I bought an identical version of this release cable on eBay for eight bucks, shipping included! See link below. Nikon seems to think that once you have bought one of their cameras, you are forever locked in to buying their expensive accessories exclusively. A previous reviewer was quite right. It's just an expensive hunk of Nikon plastic.[...]"
4,Southern Hospitality,"I admire the different voices, places, people and things that benson unearths in this book. She takes you to the hottest kitchen of the south and stirs you into the mix. You can feel the mosquitoes buzzing in your ear and taste the kool-aid. An enjoyable read for anyone who is interested."
5,Can't put it down!,"After reading a few of Raymond E Feist's novels, I ordered all of the books that he has written, nearly all of them being related to Pug and the world of Midkemia. I have not been able to stop reading, I also had my fiance read Magician and now he is catching up to me. We would both recommend all of Raymond E Feist's novels, but I would suggest they be read in order as they are all connected; start with Magician:Apprentice and work your way through. The publishing order for the series can be found at: http://www.crydee.com/raymond-feist/reading-order/written"
5,AWEOMSE,"I LOVE Raymond Feist and I am a huge fan of his riftwar series. This books starts his kronder's son's series and man does it start out well. This book starts out a tad slow, as does his other books, but it is packed with fun and tons of humor. If you don't like political books then this isnt for you. It is very much mystery, who killed who, who's lying, and who's committing treason against the empire. I highly recommend this book as it is a great add to the riftwar series, and if you loved the riftwar series and you loved characters like arutha, jummy the hand, and locklier, then you'll love this book."
3,Good Enough,"Mr. Feist has a wonderful ability to describe a situaion and make it feel increasingly desperate or like absolute bliss. The problem I see with this story is the bliss is up to par but the desperation falls remarkably short. Its not enough for your character to tell the reader he now knows what it's like to be truly hungry, you have to make the reader feel it. This short coming leaves the book with no sense of urgency. The story never really felt like it was accelerating to the conclusion, it just sort of meandered quickly and quietly towards it. I was left wondering if the pace would ever increase or at the very least the story would lead to some monumental conflict, but it never did(it teased towards the fact but never built it up). So my review is this, the foundation is there for a good story but it only has about three floors. It's a read if you love Feist but not a necessity."
4,More of an Adventure/Mystery than a Fantasy,"Great novel, but not the usual from Mr. Feist. This novel does not contain the High Fantasy that is contained in the Riftwar and Serpentwar Sagas. However, this is still a fast paced fun read. Arutha's twin sons, Borric and Erland, are sent to the Empire of Kesh as diplomats regardless of the attempted assassination of Borric (heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Isles). They must avoid unknown enemies and maneuver thru the intrigues of the Keshian court.Mr. Feist blends romance, mystery and comedy into this well-rounded tale. I particularly enjoyed Nakor the Isalani and his ""Tricks"".`Prince of the Blood' does not have an epic plot, however it does fit nicely into the overall story of the Kingdoms."
4,Exciting romp in strange lands equals good reading.,"While not exactly the deepest book I've ever read, I enjoyed Prince of the Blood. It's fast-paced, entertaining, and has enough plot to keep you flipping pages well into the night. It has more eroticism than most other sword-and-sorcery type novels, and Feist presents insights into one of the nations not thoroughly covered by the Riftwar saga."
1,Major Disappointment,"After the superlative RIFTWAR SAGA, I had no idea where this book came from and the writing style was really off in comparison.What happened? Maybe Feist didn't want to write another so soon after being on contract? I don't know.Whatever the case, the writing was totally off of his usual, brilliant style and after reading this and the BUCANEER'S TALE, I came to the sad conclusion that I would no longer get the emotional resonance I had gotten from the RIFTWAR SAGA. A true pity.I think this is an okay read but I can think of some 30 to 40 fantasy novels alone that are better. George R.R. Martin's A GAME OF THRONES, for instance, and THE LEGEND OF HUMA or NINE PRINCES IN AMBER or ELFSTONES OF SHANNARA.If his books got much better since, email and let me know with reasons."
1,big disappointment in midkemia,"This book is sooooooooooo boring! the beginning started out great then as they came to stardock everything went downhill!!!! this is the most boring book i have ever read and to be honest i'm embarrassed to say that because feist is my favorite author.......i fell in love with magician within the first chapter; i could not put it down! the same went with silverthorn-(the best book ever written IMO) Then AdaS showed how feist's style was changing........i don't know if i will continue with him....since when did he turn Sci-Fi? since when has his books sounded like a sopeopra? anyway, feist's style has changed for the worst IMO."
2,Please,When this book first was about to come out I was waiting with so much excitement only to be diappointed... too orientalist for my tastes...
3,Prince of Blood,"This book is a follow up to the Riftwar Saga. I missed seeing more of the names and characters from the previous books. There was too little mention of past names and the details of their deaths, almost as if the past characters faded away. This was a good story that will keep interest, but was too short thus lacking detail as in Feist's 4 book saga's."
4,Prince of the Blood,"I loved this book!! This story featured Aruthas twin sons that totaly cracked me up. This should have almost been a comedy. His sons where right up my alley. Two clowns that have not learned to accept their responsibilities of one day becoming the king of Midkemia. Other new refreshing characters were Nakor the wizard, My favorite, who seem to fit in very well with Borric, A young boy named Sulli and Ghuda, the one that lead them to Kesh. This team of characters were alot of fun and very enjoying to read. It was like reading The Three Stooges go to Kesh!!!! Not nearly as good as The Riftwar Storie but still worth reading. Very entertaining!!"
1,End Of the line.,"People in a small town lose their Jobs,what is the Leftwinger's and Anarchist's Solution? Shut 'Em Down of Course!If you condone Terrorism and Hijackings then this is the movie for you! I guess the Film makers wanted to Show ""The Man"" funny they become The Man as most leftists do anyhow, A snore of a movie,slow acting with that guy from the Diabetes commercials and Kevin Bacon. Only thing cool is the Locomotive itself, other than That it's typical ""The Man"" is bad Hogwash. Long Live Corporatism!"
1,Terrible transfer from film to DVD,The picture quality is the worst I have seen yet on a DVD. It is worse then a fifth generation VHS. The image is so bad that I don't know why they bothered releasing the DVD.
3,Lee's words twisted...,"It is important to remember when reading this version of John D. Lee's writings that his words were manipulated by the editor to convey an anti-Mormon message. Lee NEVER turned his back on his religion, nor did he ever point the finger at Brigham Young for the massacre (whether Young ordered it or not.) He was angry with Young when he died - he felt betrayed and rightly so and he did speak and write angry words regarding Young. But Lee actually REFUSED an opportunity to go free if he would agree to implicate Young and speak out against the church. He refused and was executed. He was a faithful Mormon to the end. This book is availible in it's more pure form under the title ""The Writings of John D. Lee."" - His diaries were also recently republished under the title ""A Mormon Chronicle"" - read these books for a more complete picture. --------- I am a Lee descendant."
1,Not at all realistic,I am a very devoted member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints(mormons). I know that the formation of Utah was aided by god for my ancestors to settle there and this book is an exageration and a byest opinion
1,I wouldn't recomemnd this book to anyone!,"Where do I start with this book? There is not a single person I would feel safe giving this book to. While the book was well written, it was truely disturbing. I have read a lot of young adult novels, and I have never come away from a book with such an ugly feeling before."
5,are you too weak to handle this?,"This has to be the most well-written book I have ever read. This is E.R. Frank at her best, writing in a style so unique and interesting that you can't help reading this book all at once. I'm so glad someone has finally stepped out of the box and created this masterpiece. The subject is raw and harsh yes but I think we all need to be informed about it like this. How are we going to make people get up and do something about it if the topic isn't thrown in your face like that? I love this book and everyone should read it."
5,America is Me by E.R.Frank,"This is an amazing book. I have never read anything so touching, scary, sad, or beautiful before. I would recommend this book to anyone over the age of 13. It is one of the best books I've ever read."
4,Good in its own right,"I read this book before reading Smith's other book, Life is Funny, which is very different. This book is the first person account of a boy named America. In the beginning, he is in a mental hospital and chapter by chapter his story unfolds. Alternating chapters are titled ""Then"" and ""Now"" and I had no difficulty following the story which describes his past as it continues with his present situation until the two meet. The chapters about the past add meaning to the present. Smith's writing in the voice of this character, who has suffered neglect and abuse, is direct and simple without being sentimental at all. I felt such compassion, understanding, and hope for him. Read this book but don't expect it to be the same as ""Life is Beautiful""."
4,America,"This book will hit home if you know any child who has been in the welfare system. It is heart warming and a heart breaking story.America - a 5 yr. old boy has been taken from the safety of a caring, loving foster home when his mother shows up to want to take him with her. Out of the hands of the caretaker, America goes back home with his mother and things get worse.She leaves America alone when going on when of her binge for drug addiction. America is then thrown back into socail welfare. America feels nothing and doesn't speak much.Dr. B - the therapist - deals daily with America and after much pushing and trying to establish trust, the trust finally comes. But, this trust has deep, dark secrets that will tear you up inside - knowing what this child went through - the one that was lost in the system.If you do not like tear jerkers then, do not read this. It will tear your heart into pieces."
5,excellent history book - important,great naval history book and great book in general about guts under fire. found myself reading the book over again after finishing it the first time around
5,It was Like You Were There,"If any story can put you in the middle of the action,"" The Last Stand of the Tin Can "" qualifies on all counts. The heroics of the men aboard the flotilla of destroyers and escort carriers, as well as the courageous airmen, in 1944 0ff Samar in the Philippines is unmatched in the chronicles of naval history. James Hornfischer has meticulously documented all aspects of this American/Japanese naval encounter and the fruits of his labor have resulted in a monumental work that will be read and reread for many years.The personal stories of many of the crew members are what sets this book apart from the others that have been written regarding this episode in the Pacific. I look forward to reading other works by this gifted writer."
5,Appreciation for the Little Guys,"I don't think I could add anything to the praise that has been heaped on this book. It is not only well researched, it is tremendously well written and accessible to those not familiar with navy terminology. The situation was so incredible and and surprising that it seems almost fictional. The bravery of the men on both sides is well reproduced. I was almost gasping for breath after reading certain sections, and it has that effect of hanging in the back of your mind for a long time after reading it. Highly recommended, almost essential for a grasp of the feel of naval combat."
2,"repetition,repetition,repetition","Great day in history by real hero's. The story is repeated and skips around and is hard to follow. If I had known to stop in the middle it would have been better. I do believe the author is a true hero, and as an American Veteran I am proud of him, but I think the book should have been organized better before writing.-----I have purchased hundreds of e-books from Amazon, but this one stud out as poorly written. Very sorry"
3,Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,"The book is a good read and gives a good account of the heroism demonstrated by US sailors that day. The major problem with the book is that it is very US-centric and presents all the US claims of damage inflicted on the Japanese as gospel with little attempt to verify the truth. Independent cross checking reveals that the majority of damage claims are grossly overestimated. That is a natural finding in the confused contests that are part of war, the fact remains that the ability to easily check the actual damage inflicted is readily available. It should have been in the book."
2,A great saga poorly told,"No question that this fellow has done a marvelous job of research, but the book's power is diminished by endless detours away from the scene of action and by the author's penchant for throwing in name after name and detail after detail until finally this reader just gave up--it was just one big jumbled battle with dozens of characters mentioned once and only once. I finally gave up in total confusion as to what, when, and where things were taking place."
3,A Bit Overrated,"The success of Tin Can Sailors is a good example of what the power of a large publishing firm such as Bantam can accomplish. Hornfischer expanded on Captain Henry Doscher's seminal ""Little Wolf at Leyte,"" published eight years ago by the lesser known Eakin Press, and Bantam made the book into a best seller.In the spirit of Steven Ambrose's many publications, this book is not so much history as a populist accounting. I would have preferred a more carefully documented treatise - along the lines of Admiral Morison. Less gore would have been appropriate as well; it benefits the reader little to learn about a sailor continuing to run after his head has been lopped off.Make no mistake about it. Bantam and Hornfischer have done a service to the memory of these brave men. A stronger editor's hand would have made Tin Can Sailors a better book."
1,audiobook cures insomnia,"Maybe it's just me but this audio book nearly caused me to fall asleep at the wheel. Twenty minutes in, I ejected CD#1 and returned it to the library. Couldn't imagine enduring all 14 CDs. Good thing I didn't buy it!! Recently listened to Forgotten 500, Unbroken, and Seal Team Six, all of which I would highly recommend. Began listening to The Heart and the Fist by Eric Greitens and love it."
2,"good narrative, factually weak","The narrative presenting the recollections of this battle from the American participants is well written and interesting but some of the history presented is appalling. The author claims the Gambier Bay was ""the only aircraft carrier ever sunk by enemy naval gunfire"" (a Google search for Glorious and Scharnhorst will readily provide evidence to the contrary). The author indicates the American escorts made 4 or more torpedo strikes on the Japanese vessels when in fact only one torpedo hit was achieved, and the statements concerning gunnery seem similarly exaggerated. I winced more than a few times reading this book."
2,The last stand of the Tin Can Saliors,I enjoyed the book but was disappointed that it was a large print addition. This was NOT noted when I ordered it and I do not like it. You must notify people of this in the future.
5,The last stand of the Tin Can sailors,"I have read many books on Leyte Gulf battles, but have never read one as riviting as this one. If you have any interest at all about naval battles, you must read this."
5,A delight,"If you love military history books this is a great book to get. I have always been interested in the WWII but I knew very little about some naval battles. Especially, the Battle of Samar. This book goes into great detail of the overwhelming odds a small task force of US destroyers and destroyer escorts faced against one of the most powerful Japanese surface action groups assembled. The first hand accounts and descriptive writing of the author makes you feel like you are actually on the USS Samuel B. Roberts and other US ships as they face the Japanese onslaught. Additionally, the book gives a you a great insight of the tactical decisions made by the US and IJN commanders during the battle."
4,gift for dad,This was a gift for my father who enjoys reading military books. Great book for those who have an interest.
5,Unsung Heroics,I listened to the unabridged Audible Audio version of this title and found the writing and the narration to be first-rate. The heroic exploits of the DDs and DEs are the focal point of this book. Their deeds deserve to be remembered.
5,Most Inspiring,I own three histories of this key battle. Additional information and the personal stories of those few who rose to thwart a much more powerful enemy make this my most valuable. You don't really know the story until you read this! The details are wonderful.
4,4.5 Stars Good Reading but Can Be Confusing,"This book is good reading about the battle off Samar and brings home the personal cost on the US side of the battle, but when the action heats up, the scene shifts from one ship to another and another and another which got to be a bit confusing for me.Also, I think Hornfiscer did a good job, by and large, but I didn't care for his assessment of Kurita. I don't think we can really know whether Kurita could have wiped out Taffy 3 or not (Hornfischer seems to think he was wise to have withdrawn).Overall, the book s very good and I'd recommend it to any history buff of WWII."
5,The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors: The Extraordinary World War II Story of the U.S. Navy's Finest Hour,"The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors: The Extraordinary World War II Story of the U.S. Navy's Finest HourHaving served aboard the Hobson(DMS26), the trainng the we underwent, but did not enjoy, is shown by the author why it is so essential."
4,Heroes,"One of the airmen featured in this book is a friend of mine. His name is Earl ""Blue"" Archer and you will see a picture of him in this book. The book is worth reading if you just read what he did the day he flew over the Japanese battleship after a fellow airman had been killed. I met Blue on a company trip about 5 years ago. He is nearly 88 now. He is still working for the same firm as myself. The man is a bonifide American hero. Buy this book and learn a little bit about a great man and a great story of heroes."
5,The Last Stand of the Pacific Fleet WW11,This book was purchased as a gift for my Retired Navy husband. This is his review.Good reading and informative. Brings back many memories of my years in the Navy.
5,A top notch telling of amazing heroism.,"I purchased this novel after seeing a History Channel special on the ""Tin Can Sailors"". The hour long documentary had been truly enthralling and I wanted to learn more. After reading ""Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors..."" I realized that the documentary had not nearly done justice to this amazing tale. This story is so well told and so amazing that one would not be surprised if it were a fictional novel. The fact that it is a true store make it all the more astonishing.The accounting of the action as a heavily outnumbered and undersized American force protects the flanks of the Phillipine Invasion force against a Japanese flotilla looking to make one last gasp at tipping the Pacific war in their favor is first class from start to finish. One of the finest WWII stories I have ever read."
4,Destroyer Sailor's comment,"As an Ex destroyer Escort Sailor during WW 11, only in a different theater of operation, I was amazed at my lack of knowledge at whatour Ships and Sailors went through during this time period & location. We knew what was going on around us, but not in other Oceans or parts of the World.I presumw we had no need to know???? Regardless, it makes me proudthat many of the 600 or so DE's built did the job they were designed forand some over and above their capabilities. Using a max 25 knot speedplatform to get within 4000 ft and fire up to 3 Torpedos was/is considered almost a kamikaze ( American Style) mission at the time.Although, in ""The last Stand of the Tincan Sailors"" that's actually whatthey did.Outstanding!!! I was never more proud of my Branch of the Navy."
5,Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,"I spent 13 years in the Navy with 3 years, 6 mo. active duty from 1956 to 1969. I served on 2 destroyers and 2 destroyer escorts as First Lieutenant and Gunnery Officer. I am a tin can sailor and very proud of it. I read everything I can about destroyers. This book is written so that I felt I was on board every ship he described. Mr Hornfischer is a great writer. After reading about the battles, it would take me at least an hour to ""decompress"" from the vivid descriptions of the events and the men who fought and died in the battles.I could see every space and compartment on the ships as he described them. I am sure I will read this book several times.Lt. John Knott, USNR, retired"
5,New Appreciation!,"The author made me feel like I was a part of the action! It also gave me a whole new appreciation for the men and women who have served in a time of war. It does start off a little slow due to providing a lot of background on the sailors. But just hang on because once the action starts, you will not be able to put it down!"
4,My ship,USS Walton DE361 was my home for 3+ years I served as gun control watch officer during Korean War firintg many rounds at vatrious targets on the eastern shore of North Korea with little discernible effect.
5,Brilliant!!!,"Among the many historic accounts of WWII I have read, this is a stand-out, can't-put-it-down gem. Not merely factual, but a sensitive and literary story of monumental valor and heart-wrenching tragedy in the midst of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Very well done."
4,The Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors,This book is a very excellent read. It was received in a timelyfashion and in the described condition.
4,"LOw budget, good movie","Well made comming to age movie, with a great ending, cerntaly a little jewel of movie, I would like to see more like this one."
3,not as advertises,I was misled by the description of this being the longer version (134 minutes) of this film.It is not. It is the same version (100 minutes) I already have. Your descriptionspecifically listed it as the longer version. An unusual Amazon inacuracy.
1,Disastrous,"Interesting perhaps as a travelogue, but as a film story (theoretically a coming of age film) not one redeeming virtue.En Tu Ausencia"
4,TURN OFF,THIS MOVIE WOULD BE 5 STAR IF IT HAD LEFT-OUT THE KILLING OF THE OLD DOG.THAT WAS A BIG TURN-OFF.
5,Fabulous performance of Russian Violin Concertos,"I stumbled on this CD and really love it. Oistrahk plays these 3 Russian pieces with the love that they deserve. They may not be as well known as other violin works, but they deserve to be!"
2,Just Phair.....,"Disappointing effort. It's like she suddenly went to church, but gets home just in time to watch TRL. Liz, your still hot, but get back to what made you interesting, solid lyrics and pervertion. This album lacks everything great about Liz Phair.."
1,BOOOOORRRRING...,"this is one of the most horrible albums that i own. i wish i had never bought it. i only bought it to see which direction liz phair would go with this album, after the fall of her last self-titled album. the only songs i like are ""leap of innocence"", ""somebody's miracle"", ""everything to me"", and ""everything (between us)"", the last song i mentioned happens to be the best one on the entire cd. liz has lost all the creativity in her writings and if i didn't know any better, i'd say her 7 (possibly 8) year old son was doing the writing. if you have been a long time fan of hers, like myself, but own all her albums except this one, then don't waste your money buying it. it's a complete disappointment and after hearing it, i've finally lost all hope in her as an artist."
5,Give It A Second Listen!!!!!,"Even you didn't like it the 1st time around, listen to it again, and this time really listen to the lyrics.I hated it the first time I listened to it, probably because it wasn't the direction I expected her to go. But this album has grown on me, and I consider it to be one of my favorites ever to this day!!!!"
5,An unexpected semi-return to form (but with a twist),"There are many parts of ""Somebody's Miracle"" that are very much reminisent of the ""whip-smart"" & ""whitechocolatespaceegg"" eras. (Namely: Leap Of Innocence, Got My Own Thing, Stars & Planets, etc.) But there definatly is a new element put into the mix. Liz has matured! & she has no problem showing it. I've been a Liz fan since ""Exile In Guyville"" & I just really love seeing her evolve. I definatly think this is a much stronger record than the last one. I just hope some of these songs don't end up in every cheesy romantic comedy like ""Why Can't I?"" & ""Extraordinary"" from the self-titled album did. But I think Liz is actually on the right path as far as artistic growth goes."
1,Buyer Beware!,"Do to the unexpectedly poor sales of this album, Capitol is rereleasing it on December 20th, with four extra track, and a new lower price. So you might want to wait to pick up a copy."
4,This is somehow different,"I believe that I am in the minority as I have liked pretty much everything that Liz has produced and this is no exception. This album took me a while to get into but after a while I found that I liked all of the tracks. I was expecting something with a bit more edge, which is definitely missing here, but all in all it is still a great piece of work.This is definitely not Guyville, but there will probably never be another one of those. Somebody's Miracle definitely has a country feel to it but Liz has returned to writing about her personal feelings which is what made her great to begin with."
4,Love It or Hate It,"It seems people either love or hate this CD. I like it quite a lot, it grows on you if you listen to it a few times. There are a lot of good songs with some nice soundingguitar work and I always like her voice. I just wish there were more pics of herbecause I like her looks as much as her singing."
2,Modern day production ruins potential,"The production on this album, like her last, is so antiseptic and highly glossed that it removes any impact or true emotion that the music may have originally had in its preproduction state. Only on a handful of slower acoustic tracks does some of Phair's talent and genuineness come through. Listening to Exile in Guyville (my favorite album for about a year when I first bought it and one of the best records of the nineties) then this is a shock. It is really sad how you can get from there to here. Ironically, I think one of the reasons her last two efforts have been so bad, fared so poorly, and been so ill-received is because of the betrayal of raw, emotional music (irrespective of the subject matter) in favor of overproduced prepackaged fluff."
2,Do we need another middle-of-the-road pop album?,"Let me start by saying that I loved Liz' work in the 90's, and I also appreciated the last album. While it was dangerously close to fluff at times, the lyrics still had a dangerous edge. Part of my enjoyment of her music comes from hoping for the ""did she really say that"" moments of ""guysville"". You have to admit, she doesn't have the strongest voice, and her attempts at melody seemed forced at times. Still, I liked that she was dealing with racy subjects in a fairly adult fashion.On this latest album, I kept waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Do we need more pale songs about domesticity and yearning, especially when the voice delivering them is so thin? On ""guysville"", the music was ragged and raw, and you always wondered if it was going to fall apart, the way you did on early Replacements albums. Here, it's precise to a fault. If I wanted polish and blandness, I'd buy a Celine Dion album. Come on, Liz, you can do better than this."
2,Shameful,"What happened to the brilliantly talented artist who created masterpieces such as Girly Sound, Exile in Guiville, and Whipsmart?What happened to the artist who created the inconsistent but very solid album, whitechocolatespaceegg? This has to be from someone else. Someone boring and bland. Someone devoid of personality. The songs are painfully bad. The lyrics are awful. There's only one explanation that I can think of for this mess. Alien abduction. This is not the real Liz. Can't be."
2,"In growing, she's shrinking her original fan base","I am a huge Liz fan of yore. ""Whitechocolatespaceegg"" is my favorite album in my collection, with ""Exile in Guyville"" being a close second. I wasn't thrilled about her self-titled album but there were a few decent songs and, of course, her trademark smattering of the f-word. ""Somebody's Miracle,"" however, was a huge disappointment. It's never been about her voice because, while I like listening to her, it's really not that great. It was more about getting her point across--bluntly. Having to rely on her original lyrics, she really missed the mark on this one. I knew that the album was probably not going to be that great and it doesn't even carry a ""parental advisory"" warning, but I didn't expect such syrupy, yucky lyrics. I will remain a Liz fan because I know what she's capable of but her evolution isn't working for me. I think by going mainstream she gained a lot of fans on one side and lost a lot on the other."
1,Where's 'I Can't Get Out of What I'm Into'?,"When I was living in Chicago, I had a 2nd generation copy of the girlysounds tape. I still have it with art-work and all. This is the first album I bought of hers since '94 when I got Whip-Smart. I got this from Amazon so because I wanted to hear then new take on ""I Can't Get Out of What I'm Into"", one of her most spunky and punky song. It's not on the CD. Did I get an edited version? What's the deal? Can someone the me? What I got instead is a CD with a bunch of flat sounding songs with not one lick of spunk or punk. What's the deal? Someone tell me where I can find the new ""I Can't Get Out of What I'm Into"". Or tell me why it's not on my CD."
1,What happened to Can't Get Out of What I'm Into??,"It appears that the ONLY song on this album that rocks, ""Can't Get Out of What I'm Into"", previously Track 9 on this record has been replaced with the dentist-office braindead ""Closer to you"" prompting this Liz Phair fan to wonder if Liz will ever ROCK again. I do not like the last two Liz Phair albums nor was I a big fan of whitechocolatespaceegg, but at least the latter album had SOME rocking numbers on it. Don't expect to hear anything on this album like 6'1"" or May Queen. 0 stars for giving us ""Can't get Out of What I'm Into"" then taking it away! Worse, I can't find any information online about why it was replaced suggesting that noone cares about Liz Phair anymore."
2,"Dull, dull, dull","Seeing Sutherland interviewed on television, I didn't expect much insight into her career from her -- her husband is clearly better at it. I had hoped that given time for reflection, something better than this would emerge. All that you really learn is how busy she was traveling here and there for engagements. It almost makes you believe that she wouldn't have had a career if hadn't been for Bonynge."
3,Everything but the flight numbers,"What a dull book. An engagement book, transcribed into 'autiobiography' makes for very dreary reading. There's every step of the way here too. I'm astonished she didn't include the trams stops and the flight numbers as well. Though not as uncharitable as Rita Hunter's, or as silly as Renata Scotto's autiobiographies, this tome has none of the excitement of Beverly Sills' wonderful book. It could have been. It's almost like Sutherland herself onstage: It was all there, but it could have been so much more exciting with a tiny bit more courage to let herself go."
3,"The memory stick was fine but..,","When I ordered two of these memory sticks online from Amazon for Christmas for my step kids cameras, I ordered in plenty of time for Christmas. But they did not arrive until after. And, they arrived in two different boxes from seperate companies. How's that for freaky. What's more, when I tried to contact the company who I thought I was buying them from, no human being ever answered the phone. The recording urged me to keep sending emails and Amazon was not terribly helpful either.Caveat Emptor."
5,Wonderfu,"Exciting, heroic adventure written with a knowledge of the geography and history of the Southwest."
2,Angola lacks,"If you are an anthropology student, or deeply into african music appreciation you will enjoy this cd. For those looking for an easy listening hip cd I would stay away. I suggest Bonga for cool Angola music."
4,All kinds of good stuff here!,"This is a best-of and a live album at the same time, combining great material from various points in the bands history. The recording quality varies from track to track but the performances are all killer. To me, many sound fuller and livlier than their studio equivalents. If you're a fan of Savoy Brown in all of its many incarnations, you'll enjoy this whole collection."
2,inconsistent quality,"I'm sorry I cannot recommend this because of the recording quality on these discs. I love Savoy Brown and these live recordings are hot but... on some tracks the guitar gets reduced to an echo in the background. Maybe it is just the discs that I got, but on some other CDs of live music from the good old days I have experienced the same or at least similar defects. I assume it was the original recording at fault, you know how it was back then...in the fog. The tracks that are of high fidelity are terrific but the inconsistency is dissapointing. I guess if you enjoy the live feeling including fading in and out from the equipment or from personal consumption maybe the wayback experience can be fun."
3,Gorillas,"Great footage of the Gorillas. Little dull on the narration, little dull on the action. I got a feeling the producers wanted the Apes to appear as big docile animals, always. Little slow on action, but informative. Usually I-Max delivers in a big way, but, this is their three star production."
3,not bad others are better though,"this is okay and interesting subject matter, but not as good as many other IMAX films-favorite places is one of the best"
3,"When your subject is boring, so is your movie","I've heard primatologists say that their research is really boring for the first couple months, before they get to know the fascinating web of social structure of the primate society that they study. This DVD supports those claims.The writers try to make it interesting, giving names to the gorillas, but it's hard to keep them straight (now was that Mbugwe grooming Gmubwe, or vice versa?). But I left with the impression that gorillas spend most of their time eating leaves and relaxing. That may be true, but I think that it's the job of the directors to make eating leaves and relaxing look really really interesting. Maybe get some MTV style quick cuts instead of the lazy slow tracking shots through the jungle.Also, some gorilla fights would be fun.It seems that the film doesn't seem to take advantage of the Imax format. But maybe I just think that because I am watching it on my 13 inch computer monitor."
1,What's so funny Ms. Sandra Bow?,"Working for 12 hours 7 days/week for several months on a cruise ship is NOT funny! Competing with 100 and more applicants for a single position is NOT funny! Your 3 pages with common sense tips on how to get a cruise ship job are NOT funny! Your shorter than Cynthia Ossenfort's job descriptions are NOT funny!The caricatures all over your book ARE funny. The ""Top 10 silly questions from passengers"" ARE funny. The ""10 things your mother never told you"" about men on cruise ships ARE funny. The 2 years old addresses and phone, fax numbers are NOT funny! All those years you have worked in Entertainment Department are immediately obvious from your book. However from my 11 years in Sales and Marketing let me tell you something. People only laugh at comedians. They DON'T buy from them."
2,Disappointing,"There are more than 10 funny pictures which are up to 1 page long while the book contains only 3 pages on how to write a cover letter and resume although its description says: ""describes 150 different jobs at sea--and explains how to get them"". I am quite disappointed from this book, the super short job descriptions and the humorous style of the author!"
3,Great Watch but Im allergic,It took about 2 weeks to get the dang watch but if finally got here. The watch is beautiful but after I wore it for a few days I began to itch. Ill have to give it away now... I have sensitive skin :(
3,Eco-drive,I like the watch and it has the cool feature of telling you when it needs to be recharged. The big down side is that citizen water resisitent is splash proof where the watch is presumably broken if it gets submerged. Most other watches that are water resistant you can swim with down to 10 feet below the surface. wish I read the fine print.
4,Good CD,"This is a really good CD. While I'm not a huge fan of all of the songs (some are too slow for my taste) most of them are very good. Unfortunately the CD is pretty overpriced. My favorite songs are: Better to Be Lonely, Pointless Relationship, It's a Beautiful Thing, Backwards Again and It's a Little Late.Recommended: Kate Voegele"
4,Spray the Funk Away,"A dozen spray bottles at this price was an excellent buy. I like them. I mix up all kinds of oil concoctions in them. However, glass is better for oils than plastic, if you're inclined to spend the extra dough. The ONLY reason I gave these little babies a 4 instead of a 5 is that you can't spray like a madwoman or madman. You have to spray and wait, spray and wait. They're a little slow on the trigger. Otherwise, great buy!"
5,Great bottle! Great price!,"Bought these little bottles to make sprays for the home and for the kids. Perfect mist, great quality (and yes tops ARE included which make it great for travel or in the purse), and I've never had a single one leak on me! Highly suggest and will be purchasing more!"
5,James Brown Gold,it's good to have old school music by James Brown since I've been a BIG!!!! fan of his music since I a was a little boy
2,Laides Hat,Looks better on line then what is.The color is true to the picture.Ladies hat not a mans hat.
1,Careful!,"Item did not fit my camera as promised. Company was nice enough, but for $25 it was not worth returning."
5,Hardrive - EP,"""Deep Inside,"" off the Hardrive EP, has got to be one of the most influential house tracks ever. Using small vocal samples from the incomparable Barbara Tucker, ""Little"" Louie Vega makes a funky, deep and bleepy track that any house-head can identify by the second measure. Kenny ""Dope"" provides a remix and The Dub mix of the track are both worthwhile, but the original is still without compare. The rest of the EP is not bad, and Barbara Tucker returns for an updating of ""Deep Inside"" called ""Is It What We Need?"" Short answer: this EP is exactly what we need."
3,Film Purchase,"Be careful when ordering, I ordered a ""New"" for the cost of $20.00, but when the film arrived it was wrapped and ready to be sold at a cost of $5.00. (boy did I overpay). Otherwise, Great movie to help people learn what our veterans went through and still experience from the effects of war and agent orange and our governments healthcare / financial efforts or failures to take care of the situation."
3,Early Erick Morrillo,This CD is a compillation of mid 90s House music. Tracks are short and not very well mixed. Morrillo's work gets much better as his career progreses. This one does not make the cut.
4,Almost the perfect double CD,"In my opinion, the ultimate Martha & the Muffins double CD would be ""Mystery Walk"" with ""The World is a Ball."" Although Dansparc has a number of tracks of interest, ""Mystery Walk"" is superior to it and is pretty much a 4-star work. ""The World is a Ball"" is a solid, five star album (hands down, their absolute best album). The re-issue of ""dansparc"" is of interest when packaged with the non-lp tracks. With out the extra tracks, ""dansparc"" is more like a three-star album. Martha and the Muffins is not just old new wave group that has come and gone as reported in some of these reviews. Their work is more like ""artsy pop"" and they really do a good job at it by adding noise and other textures with the songs that stay in your head and never wear out. One review compared them to the Eurythmics but I sold back those albums a long, long time ago. I still have my Martha and the Muffins stuff and much of it still remains on my ""must have"" & often played list."
3,A Curio,"Martha & The Muffins made fairly typical New Wave Europop similar to the Eurogliders and the Eurythmics. Not exactly exciting stuff, but basically inoffensive. M&M sound a little easier on the ears than the Eurythmics, but this is probably because they have never been overplayed. Of interest to New Wave fanatics only."
4,"Worth the money, but not a pretty set-up","I agree with the prior poster, this does not set up nicely without some major work. My husband and father-in-law actually built a stand for it out of 2x4s and mounted it to our fence to get maximum sun exposure. This method worked well.For our size pool they recommended we get two of these, but we opted to get one and see if we liked it and honestly our water was on avg. 8 degrees warmer. I was amazed how well it worked. We only used it for one summer and we took it down and are storing it for winter. I will update this next summer if we have any problems.When setting it up we did have to go buy piping and such to connect it to the pool. What you get in the box for this item is just the basics."
4,Great deal for our summer season!,"I bought this for our 12 x 20 Intex pool to extend the swim season for my two boys in Michigan. Our pool has limited sunlight, and we have used a solar pool cover for the last two years, but it didn't help much. This heater has been a GREAT addition for us! During our most recent startup, we filled the pool and the water was 57 degrees...after three hot sunny days in the 85 degree range, the pool temp was up to 88! We still use the solar cover, but mostly to keep heat from escaping at night and the diverter valve gets switched at night for the same reason. I have to agree with other posters, the unit does not lay out anything like the pictures show, and we built a wooden rack to help them lay flat at a 45 degree angle to catch the most sun. All in all, highly recommended."
1,Customer Service Woes,This product would require extensive modifications to use with an Intex pool which has the threaded fittings. I returned this product to Pools Etc Inc. The return policy you will see states a refund processed 10 business days after receiving the product. I did not receive credit until 28 days and that was after two weeks of calling and emails. The company finally credited me after I was about to contact the Attorney General and file a formal complaint. Poor customer service from Pools Etc Inc.
3,"Good, but not for small wrist","I was intended to buy this watch because its relatively small case (I have a small wrist). I went to a store to try it out, and found out that the band is not flexible enough to fit my wrist. I am not talking about taking off a few links. I am talking about the curve of the bracelet. I don't think it would fit a wrist smaller than 7 inch. Citizen's BM8400 (at Costco) has a similar style but more flexible bracelet, even though the case is slightly bigger."
4,Nice watch in a different color,"I bought this watch for my husband about a month ago. It arrived within just a few days, even with standard shipping. The Eco-drive solar power system seems to work very well. The watch keeps great time and the hands glow brightly in the dark. You really can't tell by looking at it that there are solar panels under the face, and it's really a pretty sharp looking watch. However, it's not as substantial or masculine-looking as I would have hoped, and the light blue face looks kind of strange with the silver of the wrist band, and adds to the slightly feminine look. If I were to do it over again, I would buy this watch in the dark blue or silver face color."
1,Not reliable nor durable,"I purchased this watch in 2008 for everyday office use, and within a few months it started to pick up plenty of scratches on the watch face. after 2.5 years of use, the date function for day of month stopped working. This watch just doesn't seem to hold up to regular wear, even just to go to the office."
4,Nice watch but the date is always inconsistent.,I bought this watch on 2007. I bought it for $120 new from a famous clothing store. I love it but the only issue is the date is always inconsistent and I have to keep correcting the date every month. But overall is a great watch.
2,Nice watch ----when it works!,This watch stopped working after 3 years. Sent it to Citizen and they want $90.00 to fix it. It was defective never mistreated but they want to stick the customer with the bill. Trust me stick with Seiko!
2,Lacks visuals to make the point,"Whilst I find the idea of massurrealism abstractly stimulating, this book fails to hit the mark due to the absence of images which is what is really needed in order to tell the whole story. The exception is the examples of poetry, but in fact massurrealism is principally about visual art. A book on such subject matter which consists only of text becomes increasingly difficult when one talks of new media art that includes sound and motion. The essays present each individual artist perspective, but a concise interpretation still remains in the midst."
2,Why was this book not in the kids section?,A 5th grade version of Zinn's Voices of a People's History.
1,BAD book,if u want to study high speed networking then please dont buy this book and waste your money. there are many other books which cover the same areas in equal detail. this book will not only confuse you but it will also muddle the existing concepts that u had in mind... stallings is a good writer.. he has written good books in the past.. but this time he has not come up to the level which is expected from him.
3,Good mathematical analysis,"This is a copy from the famous book of Stallings ""data and computer networks"".Even the diagrams are the same, but this book does have a tremendous amoubt of numerical computations, so you can satisfy the mathematicians in you. Now that I have had a course in data communication where the other book I mentioned above was used, I understand this book.This book is definitly not to be the 1st book on datacom, definitely the 2nd. This is an extremely boring book though, it does not invite you to read it, even though it has some very interesting topics in it."
2,"Too much to pay, get a normal speed networking book","The author aims for a neat look and straightforward diagramsbut as soon as i got to chapter 4, i am confused. I am not an industry expert but ATM doesn't seem a viable long term technology. If other people think the same way, why does the bookdescribes it in a positive way ?? The rest of the book then goesmore into theory and normal networking concepts that you canlearn from a probably cheaper, ""normal speed networking book"" ?Overall, if you already have a networking book, let's sayfrom Tannenbaum or Comer than i don't think this book is a viable""second networking book"" option.Cheers, Zoltan"
5,Good explaination of networking technology,"Mr. Stallings gave us the best explanation about the networking technology for the IP and ATM based on the endpoint communication control, network communication control including congestion control, routing algorithm and compression method etc. He explains the technology in most detail and ignores the unimportant things in time. It is a good book for networking studier."
3,Instrumental Romantic Interpretations.....,"My Heart Will Go On (Titanic), Still the One, Can You Feel The Love Tonight (Lion King), How Am I Supposed to Live Without You, I Will Always Love You, A Whole New World ( Aladdin), Tears In Heaven, I Believe I Can Fly, I Swear, Save The Best For Last."
1,"A poor counterfeit of ""Stars on 45"": Learn from my mistake.","With ""45"" prominently displayed on the cover, and stars in the background, I thought that this was by ""Stars on 45."" Note that in comparison to the prominent ""45,"" the phrase ""Performed by F4"" is tiny. I convinced myself that ""F4"" was some sound process, like Dolby B, rather than the artists that they are.Nevertheless, what is the end result? The end result is that each track sounds like it has the same instrumentation, with different words, and that instrumentation is a drum machine and a synthesizer."
3,Fun for Fab Four Fans,"I picked up this album in a used CD bin because I thought it would be good for a laugh, but it turned out to be surprisingly good. Italian high energy group F4 spins supercharged upbeat renditions of Lennon/McCartney hits that keep a lot of the spirit of the originals. The vocals are top notch. A great find for Beatles fans who like dance music."
5,Superbly written scholarly study of Qing dynasty Xinjiang,"James A. Millward's study of the Qing dynasty's governance of Xinjiang is possibly the most careful study of the subject written since Owen Lattimore's studies of Central Asia. Taking on the Fairbankian idea of concentric rings of Chinese empire, Millward reminds us that the ways in which the Qing dynasty governed its far western regions was a Manchu policy, with distinct characteristics. The treatment is topical, but does not lose sight of the chronological narrative. The study ends, however, before the Muslim rebellions in the region changed it forever, both in its ethnicity and demographics. Most enjoyably, Millward writes engaging prose, and has produced a scholarly work that is also a good read."
2,Disappointed in received condition,"I just received this today. The ""attractive wooden gift box"" arrived chipped and missing whatever was glued to the top of it. The scissors looked used, as they had fingerprints all over them. The insides of the blades were greasy - perhaps this was for lubricating purposes, but it seems too gunky to be intentional. As far as the functionality of the scissors, they probably work perfectly fine. The two star rating is for the condition they were received in, seeing how they are selling it as a gift set with no mention of being previously owned/used. I will be returning this item."
2,I have been disappointed,The plug is not suitable for my SONY Receiver ICF-SW. The specs of plug is not written anywhere and my choice was bad.
5,More Than Hoped For,"Not only installed easily but works well. I use two Nikon N65 cameras and was ready to retire them both because of the cost the batterys-about $35per change. Using four AA's instead cuts the cost by about $30 per change.The MB-17 adds a little extra depth to the overall unit and therefore it nests in my hands more comfortably.The N65's replace my old Nikon F3 which ,with the motor drive, was getting a little to heavey to carry on field trips but I did miss the size of it till I added these power units to my replacement cameras.Over all I am happier than I thought I would be."
3,Not bad / not good either,"I didn't think this was all that great of a compilation - I certainly have much better ones in my collection. The songs all seemed rather short and I kept waiting for things to really kick into gear, but it never did. Only a couple of the cuts stood out, but there's nothing on here that you can't miss IMO. 2 1/2 - 3 stars."
1,This CD is as good as the names: Blank and Jones,"I could not have been looped into a worse purchase through reasonably good reviews. This CD contains some good artists, but is one of the most mainstream, cheesy, and non-stimulating compilations I have ever heard. Please avoid the mistake of purchasing this album, and most of all, do not buy it for a friend!"
1,Many cheesy non-stimulating tracks,"I should have trusted my instincts and not purchased a compliation with the generic title ""Trance USA"". I thought that it might be a good experimental purchase, because it incorportated some artists (like Ratty), but luck was not on my side. The entire album made me feel like I was in a tourist club in Europe, or a trendi 80's club that caught on a little late. My conscience would not even allow me to sell the album to a used CD store."
5,Stires Triumphant in Debut Collection!,"Jennifer Stires has one of the most refreshing and lyrical voices to come along in years. In an era when seemingly anyone can be a poet, Stires rises above, making her own mark. She is definitely one to watch, and her collection Tormented Angel harkens back to such singular elegiac voices as Rita Dove, Sylvia Plath, and Ezra Pound. A bravura performance! Buy this collection, now.Stacey"
4,Nice shoe,"I wish the upper part of the shoe were a little bit longer, but it is still a nice shoe. The leather seems to stretch slightly over time. If it is a good fit to begin, it may become looser over time."
5,Intoduction to Mussar,I stumbled on this book when it was reviewed in the Religion section of the Houston Chronicle. Like Alan Morinis I am a secular person. Once I bought the book I couldn't put it down. Then I reread it and started to study it. I learned to do some of the exercises. I use The exercise with the elastic band whenever I am stuck in a line anywhere. It calms me down. (You'll have to get the book to learn it.)I find this book to be an excellent introduction to Mussar. It is almost painless but it does require effort and concentration.
3,No warming sensation,"It smells nice and goes on smoothly, but I don't feel any of the warmth it advertises. Maybe a little chilli oil or something in there would give it a better sensation."
5,Fantastic and fast-acting,"I am a big fan of arnica, as I tend to bang into things and acquire bruises on a regular basis. (Really girl, you need to learn to slow down a little.) This morning I slammed a toe into a foot of our bed, then had to slam on heels and go to a meeting. By 2 pm my toe was red and purple and giving me noticeable pain. The Weleda oil arrived today and when I got home I slathered it over my bruised toe -- 90 minutes later the pain is significantly lessened and the bruising pretty much gone. I'm a fan!"
2,Allergic to fragrances? Don't buy this.,"Even though this product is expensive, I have been looking for over 2 years for a real arnica salve or oil (not the homeopathic kind), and this looked like it would work. Unfortunately, it also contained an ingredient that was not disclosed in the ingredients in the ad: artificial fragrance, to which I am highly allergic. I would have returned the product, but a friend had seriously strained some muscles in the gym, so I gave it to him. He said that it provided moderate relief."
2,All pictures and no text makes a disappointing book,"The story behind the production of this book prepares you for an in depth, offbeat analysis of the dog psyche. What you get is a collection of would be greeting cards.It is funny and goes well with any coffee table but could have been so much more."
2,Menage?,"Cute. Nice art. Moderately entertaining. But the kind of book that once given, is pretty much destined to be enjoyed once - and re-gifted to adults. Bought for my grandkids, but rather than having it shipped directly to them, as I usually do, had it - fortunately - shipped to me first. Conclusion: Not for kids unless you're up to explaining a ""Menage a Trois"" caption on the otherwise benign visual content. Absent the ""menage, rating would have been higher."
4,5 stars! My fav Lou Reed album!!,Awesome! A must have album by Lou Reed! This version has great liner notes and bonus tracks. Get it today!!
2,It's mediocre at best,"The Pros:-You can reposition the product as many times as you like to get the best fit without it losing it's adhesive.-It allows you to use with any type of arm band or car dock because it fits so well.-Doesn't prohibit any functions of the ipod (i.e. sensitivity of the wheel is just as good with the shield on)The Cons:-Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. I've carefully applied and re-applied this product no less than 20 times in a variety of different ways, and it leaves numerous bubbles on the ipod everytime, especially on the screen.-If the screen is not lit up, all you can see is bubbles on the screen.-It doesn't do the ipod justice, because it looks so cheap when applied.-After 2 days with this product I'm already looking to replace it."
5,Second time around,I had this book when I was a kid and I loved it. I had it when I moved and then one day is was just gone. So I got it again. I love the pictures and it is a great supplement to a class.
5,Great little reference book,"Great little reference book for ballet. Shows ""step-by-step"" pictures of each position and/or movement. Tells you what the body position should be when executing each movement."
4,"Re the book on shyness and the one on ""Clear Speech""","I found the condition of both books excellent. The second was particularly relevant to what I was doing, although I did get some ideas from the first.I needed the books urgently and they were out of print in Australia, so I cheerfully bore the cost of the exchange rate and shipping. The books arived in good time.Patricia BryanDip.

1,ENOUGH!,"Pokemon's dead. It's pathetic. It used to be the height of pop-culture, it was everywhere. Didn't they get enough money from back then, or do they need to keep milking it from what little people still like it? Keep it in Japan."
5,It is about German Shepherd Dogs!,"Many reviews I read for other books about breeds criticized them for being very generic, with barely one chapter about the breed itself. This entire book is about the German Shepherd! The book's table of contents illustrates what I mean. 1)Meet the German Shepherd Dog 2)A Bit of History 3)Amazing German Shepherds 4)The Shepherd Bond 5)Shepherd Gear (What Your dog Needs) 6)Feeding Your dog 7)House-Breaking Your German Shepherd Dog 8)Obedience-Training Your German Shepherd 9)German Shepherd Behavior Problems 10)Keeping Your German Shepherd Dog Healthy 11)Canine Medical Conditions 12)Medical Problems Common to the German Shepherd Dog 13)Home Medical Care 14)The Most-Asked Questions About the German Shepherd Dog Appendix: Guide Dog Schools"
5,This One Really Kicks,"I am new to Okkervil River. In fact, I am so new that I listened to all 3 previous albums just weeks before The Stage Names came out. Don't Fall In Love With Everyone You See, Down The River Of Golden Dreams, and Black Sheep Boy. It's difficult to listen to the first 2. But once Black Sheep Boy was in... there was no turning back. Perhaps it was their performance on Conan O'Brien that inspired me to write this review. Here it goes.The Stage Names does not disappoint one bit. This band sounds like Counting Crows and Wilco fused together. They don't compare to either for they are all different. But maybe the mere mention of those 2 bands in the same category as Okkervil River should draw a whole lot of attention to this band's sound. Throw in a dash of Connor Oberst of Bright Eyes... and you have Okkervil River whispering to a shrieking orchestra of guitars and drums. Add a few more instruments... and you have completely well-balanced 4th album."
4,What a great album!,"This is one of my top 10 of 2007 so far. ""John Alyn Smith Sails"" and ""Plus Ones"" are the two standouts on the album, but the whole album is worth repeated spins. Buy it and see for yourself!"
5,Outstanding album,"This is a truly outstanding album from start to finish. Excellent songwriting and sensibility. Compared to OR's previous albums, this one injects a healthy dose of classic rock and roll, without losing the thoughtful lyrics and earnestness. Musically, this reminds me of the Kinks' great early 1970's albums with some strikingly similar songs and themes - check out ""Everybody's In Show Biz"" and the Lola album for example."
3,A Collection of Hits All On One CD,"While not perfect, this CD is a great addition to a CD collection."
2,Not What I expected,Product turned out to be too long for my application and I had to fabricate replacement parts that solved my problem of holding batteries in place.
1,Possibly one of the most useless books I've read.,"I'm giving this book one star simply because there's no method for giving it less than one star.This book is for the absolute beginner. I had hoped to find something a lot more informative than this. If you actually need a book of this caliber, doing anything major with multimedia is probably beyond your grasp.Save your money and learn to use your F1 key."
1,Demon-possessed film,"I love this type of movie, so I'm easy to please, but this one goes straight to my ever-growing list of ""Worst Films I've Ever Seen"". The ""special effects"" of demons were laughable, as was the directing and ""acting"". Very disappointing.**Update 8/22/10: I just re-read this and I swear to God I cannot remember a single solitary thing about the movie, except that it would've made great MST3K material. < Sigh, I do so miss Joel and his robot crew.>"
2,Well...,"The acting is fairly questionable, in general. It is a very early example of Jason Guess's work, and he's really cute with hair. REALLY cute. I am, however, biased. The special effects are really quite humorous. The plot, well, is thin. The frequent references to Jesus are confusing and have little grounding in the rest of the story. Good for an amusing half hour and some priceless quotations. ""It's like the devil's collecting souls, and he's got like a zillion ways to do it. He's trying to destroy us"". It's pretty funny. Oh, and Trip? What a name!"
4,Text Book,This book arrived in great condition and before my class began. Looking forward to ordering more texts for future classes.
5,Great quality product.,"This product shipped quickly, it was a very good quality product. Just as it was advertised. Also a great book for teachers."
5,Another homerun,Great book. Use it many time as a resource and also share with my peers at work. This is worth the money.
4,Great info,"I had to buy this book for a grad class, but I ended up keeping it and using it. This book gives you son ideas of how to differentiate some things in your classroom. It doesn't have quick and easy answers, but it does give you a plan to start."
5,A must for every good teacher,I first was shown this book in a graduate class on Effective Teaching and used it for an assignment. I couldn't get over how many useful strategies were laid out in front of me to apply in my classroom. The strategies offered are realistic and useful in any subject - I teach high school French and apply many. The tools offered are applicable to all and any student in your class.This book should be part of every good teacher's professional toolbox; it is highly recommended.
5,Home Network,"One of the simplest networking programs I have come across. The file server/desktop, 2 laptops, 2 netbooks & two game systems all are up & running within 20 minutes of install. I did have some intial problems with Windows 7 sharing files across to other non-Windows 7 systems, but it was resovled with an automatic update from the software."
5,"One ""New"" song, and a bunch of great old ones","Well here is the ""rest"" of the Blotto treasure chest! If you know who Blotto is then you want this CD! Many of the cuts are ""Live"" so you can close your eyes and relive the past for a few minutes. For those of you that never saw them live that's too bad... you missed out on all of the FUN! For someone not familiar with just who (what?) Blotto is I would recommend they buy the ""Collected Works"" CD first (you will be back for this one though !) Russ near Deeeetroit"
4,Great book,"If you are interested in Rich's work, this book is a must-buy. It contains famous essays (like ""Compulsory Heterosexuality"") and other key works. It is easy to read, well-organized, and essential for the Rich fan or scholar."
3,ok but not great.,I purchased 2 of these self inflating pad to go to a week long camping trip to Ten Mile River with my son and his troop. The pads inflated by sections but the section where our legs would be didnt inflate as well and the other sections. the mattress pad was not wide enough the sleeping bag was wider then the pad. I wasnt really satisfied with this product and will be returning it for a wider one piece.
4,Pretty good,One section didn't self inflate and I had to blow it up. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
3,Not Electrolux Brand,"This filter appears to be fine. However, I purchased this product instead of one of the other listings because the product description stated that it was an Electrolux filter ""by Electrolux"". I believed I was buying the name brand filter.The quality seems fine. Just know that this is not an Electrolux filter."
2,collapes easily,MY child did not like this toy while at the tummy stage. its a bit flimsy on the sides so if your child pushes to hard it flips over or collapes. My child liked it more when she could put it on her lap and play with the toys.
2,always falls down,I thought that the item would have 3 sides so that it would stand up when my daughter reached for it or batted at the toys. It is more like a tent but has nothing to keep it standing up. It ends up laying flat on the floor. My daughter loves the toys and mirror but we've had to try different things to keep it standing up. I was disappointed in it for a Fisher Price Toy.
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this item. The photos are slightly misleading, since this toy does not stand up well on its own. My daughter loves the bright colors, the mirror and the crackling insects, but I always have to lay it on the side for her to play with it, or else it falls over on her face. Not conducive to a happy baby! I would not recommend this to friends."
4,Super Baby Toy,"Great baby toy. Yes, it does easily flip over, but my 6 mos old doesn't seem to mind, she just plays with whatever side is available.She does prefer the sunshine ball side the best.She's my 3rd baby, little ones don't pay attention very long to one thing. This is an inexpensive toy that engages for awhile.....until the next thing catches their eye or you pick them up! Babies want to be held.;)"
2,Not the best floor mirror,"I bought this product because I wanted something to make tummy time more interesting for my 4 month old son. Although we do still use it (he is 5 1/2 months), it is simply not a great floor mirror. It is fairly unstable, so any time he swats at it, or grabs the toys that hang off it, it falls over, sometimes right on top of him. The toys are interesting to him, but because of the design, I would not recommend it."
4,The author says thank you to readers,"Hello,I happened upon the review of my book published in 1982 or 83. I was astonished to see that there are still copies available, since the book has long been out of print.Thank you readers! Enjoy with my compliments and best wishes.Kathleen Jemison (no longer Demas!)"
1,Ander wood must live ander a rock!,"The costume is horrible bro. how can you say, this is the best costume you ever saw. are you dating this girl or what? I'm sorry but this movie was awful. Misty cant act, she has no curves, and no personality. the only good thing about this thing is julian wells. maybe one day she will work with someone who can make her look good. as far as this film goes. two thumbs way down man, way down."
1,"Ok, so it's a spoof!",Another word for spoof is farce and it's definitely that. It never quite makes it to softcore and humorous it isn't but it does have crumby sets and atrocious acting. One stars is too high.
3,"It's so bad, it's almost good","What can I say about this movie that has't been said already? It's bad. But if you compare it to the other movies in it's genre, it's actually pretty good. As a parody, it follows all the rules of parody movies. Silly name changes (Peter Parker-Patricia Porker), similar outfits, even familiar sets. But the effects are so cheesy it's actually funnier than the jokes. The only problem I have with the movie is that the sex scenes the movie was made for, really slow things down. It's like...""I get it. They're doin' it... Let's move it along."" But despite it's cheesy effects and super looooooooong sex scenes. I give this movie 3 stars. Why? Because it made me laugh folks. That's why. It's one of the few movies that relish in it's cheesyness. And for that, I commend you. Also, who could hate a movie with lines like, ""Send in my over-paid eye candy""?"
1,Size not as specified,"The actual measurement of this item is 5 3/8 X 3 1/8. The specified size is 10 x 7.8 x 1.1 inches. The useful capacity is about a cup and a quarter. It would accommodate a couple of leftover chicken wings but not a fish fillet, which was my intended use."
3,Excellent,"This product is such an efficient size, I prefer square kitchen items as they are more compact and are better space savers.I give them as gifts all of the time - gave them to all of my co-workers for Christmas and they LOVED it!! Practical and something everybody can use!I don't put any plastic in the microwave so the glass makes them versatile and better for the environment and our health for cooking."
3,Way smaller.,I looked at the picture- didn't read. No wonder it was so cheap. I thought I might use to marinate meat. Perhaps a cocktail wiener or a half piece of bacon. But it is my fault and since they are saying plastic is poison now- anything I can stick in glass is good.
1,OTN is much more better,"The installation procedure is in some points wrong. so a beginner has no chance to run the samples. The theory part of this book is not bad but in some chapters more or less stuff for kids! A frank advice, try to find another book."
4,SubArachnoid Space - 'These Things Take Time' (Relapse),"'These...' features seven tracks,simply titled ""A"" through ""G"".Every cut serves it's purpose with no disappointment whatsoever.Have always liked this band from San Francisco.Even got to see them play in a bar during their tour to support this very disc.Simply over the top mind-altering psychedelic/space rock.One of the sorts of music I practically live for,anymore.Band's line-up:Mason-guitar,Jason-bass,Melynda Jones-2nd guitar and Scott Ayers-drums.Should appeal to fans of Cul De Sac,F/i,Kinski and maybe Bardo Pond."
5,Dog Loves it!,"My 100 Rottweiler likes to chew on plush toys, rubber toys and ropes. He usually doesn't chew up his kongs. This is of similar material and despite him chewing for hours on the rubber it has held up. I don't know what it would be like for dogs that actually chew up their Kongs. He likes grabbing the rope and whipping the ball across the yard and then running after it. It keeps him entertained."
1,Did not receive the football pictured. I received a different bears football that I do not like.,I did not receive the football that is pictured. What is the point of findng a football you like and buy it if you do not get what you want. Very ANNOYED.
3,Dress-up for boys,It is hard to find things for little boys to play 'dress-up' in and this helped my two and a half year old grandson to play 'dress-up' with his four year old sister.
3,Assembly,"Vertex MO480 Deluxe Garden CartWhy somebody would market a product and then enclose directions which look like they have been recopied 115 times is beyond me. I am fairly mechanically adept, but it took longer than necessary to figure this out using the directions. The ""blow ups"" were not large enough to be helpful. Not clear from the directions or drawing how to line up the load plate (bottom rack), (use top or bottom of cross piece when setting bolts?)Although the directions were a bit of an annoyance, product assembly took about an hour. It was very difficult to line up the upper rack and upper tube framing holes, and required WD40, and a mallet to repeatedly re-center the holes.Haven't used the product yet. Wheels look cheap and suspect they will have to be replaced after a few seasons of use.Impression is above average mechanical ability required to assemble, or less than above with a lot of patience."
1,very disappointing,This cart shouldnt sell for more than $10. I got this for my mother and tried to assemble it on Christmas. The parts are so cheap that they wouldnt even fit together. You might think it would be of a little better quality based on the price. I am returning it.
5,excellent!,"I was already aware of this book from research. I felt that I had to buy my own copy. Upon receiving the product,I discovered that it had been signed by the editor, the foremost authority on John Philip Sousa, Paul E. Bierly. AMAZING!"
2,veritas tenon cutters,"I am not very pleased with the durability for the sharpness of the cutting blade. The tool worked only fair to acceptable before the blade became dull and the depth setting screw fell out. I purchased a Logman Tenon Maker to replace this tool and couldn't be happier. The Logman produces a high quality tenon with much better control, lower price for a complete set of sizes, and I do not have to worry about sprained wrists or dull blades."
5,Quality civil war book,"The writer goes into sufficient detail and background to provide an understanding of the big picture. Yet, it is written in such a way as to make it readable and very enjoyable. I found it excellent."
3,"Good, but No Tracey Takes On...",Why Tracey keeps doing these specials is beyond me. She needs to do another Takes On type of show which showed off what she could really do.
1,Kind of a Drag,"This wan't the Tracy I was hoping for. The whole DVD is just her acting out her life story, and it wasn't all that funny. I was expecting something more like the Tracy Ullman show, but was quite disappointed. Wish I could get my money back."
3,Beautiful but fragile,I love the set. Though I found the spoon in the sugar bowl to be very fragile . It was only used in the morning for about two weeks and the spoon broke at the joint where the thin part begins. It had not had any pressure so I didn't understand the breakage. I can only imagine it is a flaw in the design. I love the set but was disappointed in the spoon. The spoon is now unusable.
3,Good information,This book has good information and is very good for people with limited marketing experience and ideas. It does not give much detail on setting up a marketing campaign. It does give good markeing ideas that can be used or modified.
3,It's good for a newbie,The book is very nice and popular abroad but not for someone who been into marketing for a while. It's also somehow dated.
1,Do not waste your money!,First the batteries are for a counter. It didn't work. There was no vibration no suction or any other thing a man would want in such a device.It is soft and enough friction to get off the first time or two. It is a manual device . You have to do all the work.It is a high price sleeve.
4,Easy-to-read Story,"I recently read Mark's latest book, ""Mastering Team Leadership: 7 Essential Coaching Skills"", and decided to buy this one as well. I really like this one better because it is written as a story.It's a lot like ""Who Moved My Cheese"" and The One-Minute Manager Series by Ken Blanchard. Short, in story form, easy-to-read.This book also focuses on the team and individual team members, showing the reader their perspectives, challenges and successes.Another customer comment wished for this book in Spanish. And it is! We got ours by calling Mark and he got them to us."
1,Unbelievably awful writing by clueless author.,"Having heard of this book, which purports to be an exposé of child protection bureacracy, I sought it out. Slogging through the most turgid prose imaginable, I discovered it reflected nothing but the professional cluelessness of the author whose marginal literacy was certainly suitable for nothing but vanity press publication. The Texas family service certainly seems awful, but the author was hardly one to propose a remedy for its systemic difficulties, being part of the problem herself. A sure miss. Ugh!"
3,An interesting crossover,"The art is good but not great, and the story is to short and when they introduce 8 character the tale begin to be a little boring and with no sense, but the writer try to show the similitudes between both teams X-men and Fantastic Four and he triumps. I was expecting more."
1,BOYCOT THIS BOOK!`,"Pat Lee should be boycotted for what he did to the men and women who worked for him under Dreamwave. As a fan of the writers and artists who worked hard for that company, I am disgusted that he would leave so many of them unpaid for months on end."
5,A classic work on real life cannabis use in rural Jamaica,"This classic work has gained new significance with the release of the recommendations of the Jamaican Ganja Commission in August 2001. Rubin and Comitas give a chronology of cannabis usage and legislation, followed by a thorough study of how cannabis is used in rural communities, primarily by poorer sections of the population. They found little evidence of harmful effects as they described the informal social controls and customs that regulated its use more effectively than punitive laws ever could. A must read for everyone seeking a thorough understanding of cannabis and how best to control its use."
1,Typical Hateful Propaganda,It seems funny to me that The events of 1974 seem to be the only talking point from a greek Cypriot perspective. And it seems a mystery to me why the events of the 10 years before the Turkish intervention never seem to be documented. Killings murders and attampted genocide of the Turkish Cypriot population by the Greek Cypriots seems so un-important. Not forgetting the many Greek Cypriots killed by other Greek Cypriots from opposing factions. What is the point of this film ? it is a sob story made by a one eyed director. Unfortunately this sort of propaganda is all too readily availobale from all greek Cypriot sources. I ask all believers in the validity of this documentary : describe the events between 1960 to 1974. Then we might consider changing the name of this film to somthing like'Rescue from Genocide !!!'
1,Interesting yet not objective,It is a mildly interesting work but it lacks objectivity. I would prefer a more objective piece of documentary due to the violent nature of relations between the Greeks and the Turks.
1,Bias Embodied!,Where is objectivity? This is a single-sided projection of history... Always a failure!
1,CYPRIOT PETG57 - DECEMBER 5 2005,"THIS MESSAGE IS FOR THE ""GREEK"" CYPRIOT PETG57 : YOU ARE NOT WORTHY TO BE A GREEK, YOU ARE A SHAME TO OUR RACE, TO OUR GREEK CIVILIZATION.I HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT MOTHER GREECE HAD ALWAYS STOOD BY OUR SIDE IN CYPRUS AND WE OWE SO MUCH TO THOSE GREEK SOLDIERS-HEROES WHO GAVE THEIR LIFE FOR WOTHLESS ""GREEKS"" LIKE YOU !ARE YOU A TURK ? IF NOT REAL TURK, FOR SURE YOU HAVE TURKISH GENES WHICH ""DICTATED"" THAT SHAMEFUL MESSAGE.AS A GREEK CYPRIOT, I LOVE AND GREATLY RESPECT OUR MOTHER GREECE, I FEEL DEEPLY GRATEFUL AND I PAY MY TRIBUTE TO ALL THOSE GREEKS WHO ARE STILL BURIED IN CYPRUS AND WHO CAME THERE TO HELP UNGRATEFUL CYPRIOTS LIKE YOU.POSSIBLY YOU HAVE TIME TO SHOW YOUR REGRETS AND CONDEMN THE TURKISH INVASION WHICH SLICED OUR VERY AND ETERNALLY GREEK CYPRUS. UNLESS YOU ARE A TURK !GEORGE AGATHOKLEOUS, KYRENIA."
1,Very Bad,"As a person who have been living in Cyprus since 1967, I can easily say that, the content of this DVD doesn't reflect the realities of what was lived in Cyprus in 1974. It is a one-sided, nationalist reflection of most probably an ill personality. I am rating this DVD as 1-star. That single star is for the fact that, it is a very good example of how one can twist the realities of history according his desires."
3,Review of Attila '74,"The best way to put this is that this is a very good documentary of the events that transpired in cyprus in 1974.The scenes were shot just after the conflict and the people that the filmaker speaks to have fresh memories of the events that transpired. There are some funeral scenes that are a bit intense and it seems that the mouners are playing to the camera a bit. Being a history buff , I thought the filmaker did a good job , got alot of the green line shots and did his best to show that Turkey was the evil invader in his opinion. I don't remember him speaking to many Turks though."
2,Assumuptions narrow the field for this self help book,"Covering a limited range of emotional reasons for this compulsion & how to address them. Useful to those particular sufferers..But if like me, hoping to help a family member with their hoarding, whose particular attitudes & reactions aren't mentioned anywhere, not really much help.I did learn a few things - the difference between OCPD & OCD.. Not the book it claims to be..Strongly suggest reading review by Betsy1479 (Jan. 18th)."
4,Solid Help,"I accidentally discovered that a friend had a hoarding problem. I wanted to help her, but I was clueless, and my efforts did nothing to truely help her. This book is non-judgmental, clearly written, well organized, offers specific therapies to help overcome hoarding and specific help on how to clean up the accumulated mess and prevent relapse. It is really helpful, but the reader has to plan to take the time to actually think about and do the exercises. It takes time, but it's worth it."
5,"Logical, Effective Info and Methodology","As a mid-level hoarder (had pathways), this book provided helpful info and an effective methodology for conquering my hoarding. It discusses cognitive therapy, which many people with depression will be familiar with.I also read Peter Walsh's Its All Too Much. It provided additional inspiration and help in knowing what to toss and in planning my rooms. However, Walsh's approach of a quick sort that takes a day or two was not feasible for me as a hoarder. I needed to see tangible results in a short period of time, or my efforts would fall by the wayside like so many times before. Overcoming Compulsive Hoarding gave me the tools to do that.For the first time, I believe I am truly conquering this problem for good and don't have to panic that someone might see inside my apartment."
4,Two great stars!!!!!!!!!,"This a little gem of a movie. I bought it because of the twostars in it, I did not know anything about the movie. I found it to bevery enjoyable. Patricia Neal does a superb job and Shelley Winters ishard to beat in roles where she can be disagreeable.These were two of Hollywoods great actresses!!!!!!!"
3,"Okay, but pricey for a piece of plastic","I have bought this waste toner bottle before. It fits my laser printer, and as I said, it's an expensive piece of plastic to hold used toner."
1,Nope,"I had high hopes after reading the positive reviews, but it didn't work for me. I took the entire bottle as directed. My allergy symptoms didn't change, but my back started hurting (don't know for sure if that's related)."
4,good bang for the buck...,"I was looking for a nice, affordable red dot sight for my Sig 522 plinker. I had seen some favorable reviews for this red dot optic on some other sights, but was surprised with the range in prices listed between websites. I went with the 40mm truglo off of Amazon and have been very pleased with it. It is a lot larger than you'd think from the picture provided, which in my case is a good thing. It provides a wide sight picture allowing quick and easy target acquisition. I had it out at the range today and was able to lock in the sight in 3 groups of 3. Hard to beat this scope at this price. Am considering getting another for my AK."
2,Didn't work for me,The parallax was horribly asymmetric with the dot becoming a line and darting off the left side with movement to the left. UP/Down and to the right was smooth and like it should be. This had nothing to do with the position adjustment. The lens caps pop open by themselves all the time. The transparent lens covers are so low quality they are not useful when down. Just didn't make the grade at all. A Leapers replacement worked out much better.
5,Great,Seems fine. I haven't shot yet with it but it seems right on accurate and for the money it's a good buy
5,Beautiful composition wonderfully realized and executed,"The composition itself is so beautiful, it really deserved to be brought to light and to life by this excellent troupe of performers.Lavishly embellished, glorious vocal harmonies are performed on this album for the work of this Italian composer.Beautiful composition wonderfully realized and executed. Bravo!5 Stars rated.Ken Cybulska"
5,PRECIOUS LOVE STORY,"For anyone who has ever had a first love and lost it, this book is for you. It's a beautiful, heart-renching love story. I couldn't put it down. And keep the kleenex handy! This story will touch your heart."
5,wonderful love story,"Do you believe in DESTINY?? This was one of the saddest love stories I have read. Knowing it was a true story, made me realize how lucky some of us are to not have had to live her life..She truly is a most remarkable woman."
5,WHY READ FICTION?,"It blew me away that this is a true story. I kept thinking of a real young woman experiencing the euphoria of young love in romantic Budapest, her terror of the increasingly shocking Nazi atrocities, and her resulting confusion and resentment. And what a humdinger of a climax -- true to boot! This book is beautifully written -- straight from the heart. I couldn't put it down."
5,The human spirit endures,"Thank you, Betty, for sharing your story with the world and for showing us how love can sustain the human spirit in a time of hell on earth. My heart went out to everyone in your life, and I only wanted your suffering to end. A deeply moving love story."
2,DVD doesn't live up to magnitude of rides,"When I saw the list of coasters that would be featured on this DVD, I was instantly turned on. The quality however, leaves something to be desired.First problem is mastering. It's possible that I got a bad disc, but there are drop-outs on several tracks.The second is the actual POV that they use. Most of it is park-sponsored, and much of it shot on sub-par tape formats that look ugly for DVD. Switching views only works some of the time, and rides like Dueling Dragons only show you one side of the ride.The graphics follow a random standard of fonts and information included, and make the show as a whole seem like a high school video product.When will someone who really knows what they're doing shoot one of these videos?"
1,AMERICAS GREATEST ROLLER COASTER THRILLS,"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN,I PURCHASED THIS MOVIE FOR ITS ENJOYMENT AND TO USE AS A DEMO FOR MY COUSTEMERS.IT SAYS DTS SUROUND SOUND ARE U KIDDING IT SOUNDED LIKE STEREO SOUND WITH 1970'S MUSIC WHERE WAS THE DTS SOUND.THE BIGGEST WASTE OF $20.00 DOLLERS I HAVE EVER SPENT!!!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"If you are thinking about buying this to get an idea of what it would be like to ride these coasters, don't waste your money....they don't stay on a point of view shot of the rider for longer than a few seconds. They seem to be fixated on showing you the reaction of the riders rather than what the rider would see if they were riding the coaster! You can do better by just going to most major theme park websites and viewing their rider POV for the coaster of your choice.Dear Video Producers...your audience for this video is the coaster freak..they want to see what it would be like to ride these coasters...they do not care how other riders react to the coaster....for your next attempt, spend more time showing the rider POV so we can feel like we are there, and less time on the reaction of tourists riding these coasters."
4,Family encounter,I thought it brought our whole family together for an invigorating trip through history and fun. We popped the popcorn and it was on...when it was over we felt like we had been to the amusement park...get it
3,MEDIOCRE FILLER SCORE + AMATEUR FOOTAGE = FALLS FAR THIN,"... The multiple-angle-of-choice features could've been a whole lot better, at least on ALL coasters, since some videos are as thrilling as watching an old third rate film on an old videotape, only more DULL. (Viper's footage is seriously mediocre compared to Great White and Timberwolf on Vol. 2.) And where's Millennium Force at Cedar Point? There could've just been a re-issue of the volumes of the past, with frequent up-to-date info (though Vol. 1 features the World Trade Towers, and they should be chopped off the video since both towers tumbled to the ground.) instead of recycled footage from volume 1. At least the cheesy computer-animated gray-screen ride videos of the past weren't featured here.Most of this video is just cheap dreck. Could've been much better with a higher budget."
3,MEDIOCRE FILLER MUSIC + AMATEUR FOOTAGE = FALLS FAR THIN,"This video is a rip-off if you have to pay $20 or more, but $14 wouldn't be that bad. The multiple-angle-of-choice features could've been a whole lot better, at least on SOME coasters (Viper's footage seriously mediocre compared to Great White and Timberwolf on Vol. 2.) And where's Millennium Force at Cedar Point? There could've just been a re-issue of the volumes of the past, with frequent up-to-date info, (though Vol. 1 features the World Trade Towers, and they should be chopped off the video since both towers tumbled to the ground.) instead of recycled footage of volume 1.Most of this video is just dreck. Could've been much better with a higher budget."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want first person ride along, don't order this DVD. It only gives you a couple of seconds of riding from the rider's point of view. The rest of the time you are looking back at the riders in the coaster as they scream and have fun and as you ride backwards in the camera view."
1,Both pitchers cracked quickly,"I used this pitcher to make iced tea in the fridge (i.e., no boiling water). The original one cracked, so I ordered a replacement. It cracked, too. Maybe it can't be put with the dishwasher?"
3,wish it was bigger,"this is an ok water pitcher. wish it was bigger. ok for everyday use. not that fancy. but good to have if you dont have any everyday pitcher. not bad, would recommend, yes."
4,Good Pitcher,"I am very happy with this pitcher. Good, heavy quality and the shape is perfect. Don't be afraid to try it out."
4,Pretty,"This really is a pretty pitcher, and is deceptive about holding more than you think. It kinda looks like the Koolaid picture without the smiley face."
5,Excellent glass,"The glass pitcher is beautiful. Impressed with the glass used. Not cheap.Heavy, clear, not a distorted look. Definitely worth buying without breaking the bank. I've seen more expensive pitchers that didn't look as nice."
4,glass pitcher,Pitcher is very nice. A little smaller than I expected but other than that it's quite nice. Made in Mexico.
2,Cracked immediately by handle,"Within a day or two of opening box and starting use, a 2-inch long crack was very visible by the handle. I never put hot liquid in it (used for lemonade only) and don't feel I misused it. I had handwashed it only. The crack didn't leak, so I continued to use over the past month because although the crack was ugly, pitcher was not leaking. Today crack much bigger (wraps all the way around the glass handle) so I'm sure it is unusable now(handle could fall off on me causing unsafe situation). Wow, my $20 didn't get me very far. And, this is not an ""ugly"" pictcher, but certaily looks are nothing to write home about either. Looks just like the ""Mr. Koolaid"" pitcher. That association doesn't say ""beautiful"" or ""elegant"" to me."
1,From the Author,"I leave it to others to rate this novel, but I believe that this, my 45th novel, is the finest short fiction I have written. It is about a courageous editor, Angie Drum, who discovers that her own son, the mayor of a Kansas cowtown, is corrupt. She chooses to expose him and his cronies, at great anguish to herself. Her moral courage and determination lie at the heart of the story.The cover depicts three armed gunmen, but do not be misled. There are no gunfights in this story. The Hollywood West does not exist in this novel. It is simply a story of a woman of great spiritual beauty wrestling with her conscience, and in the end, doing what is right, at terrible cost.I am grateful to Amazon for letting me provide an accurate description of the novel for the benefit of readers and customers."
4,Cute Gift,"This is a good gift to give to anyone, no matter their age, because you get your own star with it! Younger kids might enjoy the stuffed animal more though."
5,Buy this album,"Hands down, this is the finest gospel rap CD the industry has ever produced. T-Bone, although always great, finally has a real handle on what the gospel rap ministry is all about, and delivers a Latino West Side punch that bumps like no other."
5,A MUST OWN CD....JUST ADD TO CART RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!,"On this fourth CD of T-Bone's...he demonstrates his lyrical skills that seem to flow easily out of him as if it is fluid. The beats done by Chase are comparable if not surpassing those of Dr. Dre. Don't even think I'm joking. This album is pure quality. What's phat is that these brothers don't speak on the usual ghetto cash, money, sex, etc. They speak on ways out of the ghetto. Instead of focusing on the problems. T-Bone focuses on the solutions. If you at all like Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, or X. Then you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection. One love. Great job again T-Bone!!"
2,What....this is Gospel? Could have fooled me!,"This was one of my First CD's I bought when I got saved and could not belive what my ears was hearing. He was on the CD calling wemon ""broads"" his exact wording was ""where the broads be in the club dancin. GIVE ME A BREAK!!! We are suppose to be set apart. He is TOOO much trying to fit in the world. I have heard other gospel rappers that have tight beats BUT the lyrics are ALL ABOUT CHRIST!!! I would not recommend this CD..I gave this CD 2 stars for effort"
2,My toilet bowl brush is more inspiring and uplifting,"And I hope you're not referring to me as not recognizing real Hiphop (this is how it's spelled) when I hear it. Just click on my name and read my reviews. I actually prefer to hear hiphop without the expletives, but if you can overlook them to see a greater message, then it is worthwhile. And T-Bone's messages just can't hold a candle to those of past hiphop legends. I'm not here to burst your bubble, maybe you normally don't listen to rap, so if you think T-Bone's the greatest, I will let you think that. So just ignore those hip hoppas who laid the foundation in the past that T-Bone is now standing upon. Yeah, they're all garbage right? None of these secular artists ever even mentioned their beliefs in their music before, huh?By the way, my favorite MC ever is Rakim, and he practically never cussed, and I'll be damned if T-Bone could ever construct as coherent and inspiring of a song as ""The Mystery (Who Is God?)."""
3,It's ok,This album is ok. I own other cds by T-Bone and this one just did not minister to me like some of his others. He does have some powerful messages but sometimes its hard to understand what he is saying when he is rapping rapidly.
3,it was an ight listen..but na heard better,"this was album was good..but not the best of ive heard..tracks that truly stand out in this are ""Wipe Your Tears"" ""Conversion"", ""Mami Linda"" "" Last Street Preacha"" ""Freinds"" "" U dont know"" "" Throw yo hands up"" and sum other were alright..but after hearing it a while u get annoyed by thew same stlye he repeats in his raps.. id stik wit Cross Movement.. but i gave this 3 stars cuz it aint the worst and it aint the best..dunt get me wrong..this album is good..jus not that good"
5,T-BONE'S ONE OF THE GREATEST RAPPERS EVER!!!!,THIS IS T-BONE'S BEST CD. AND A BIG CHANGE FROM HIS OTHER CD'S. BUY THIS CD.
5,Off the Hook,T-Bone goes off in a way explosive way that is just unbelieveable this was my first album of true christain rap I bought it as soon as it was released the best track on the disc is number 8 but the rest are phat too This california thug turned to GOd and has been drawing everyone's attention with his earlier albums I feel that Bone is one of the rapper that innovated the industry and led to the great artists we have now If your looking for other great christain rap artists I reccommend>FTF- fireproof>Antonious- principalities>T-bone- boneyard box set>D.C.P.>Lil Raskull>Prime Ministerthey're others are well but that's off the top mail me for more info
5,"Strange, but charming","This book had to be the strangest thing ever. Some parts were random, Virgil becomes a fridge, a vampire locked in a room, a cat named king henry, its all there. Though it is strange, it all seems to come together at one point. I recommend this book, it's not for young children, more like 16+ due to some harsh sex scenes."
5,Excellent,"This is one of the best examples of Japanese postmodernism available in English. It's like Brautigan with a touch of Barthelme, but also reminiscent somewhat of Haruki Murakami--undoubtedly one of the best things I've read in the last year. Hopefully, more of Takahashi's work will become available in the near future."
4,all american read,"Samantha Madison knows she is a talented artist. However, her brilliance is overshadowed by her perfect older sister Lucy. Then, when she gets caught doing celebrity drawings in class, she gets punished for her skill by being sent to an art class of all places! Sam doesn't want to be forced to conform to ""acceptable"" art, so she takes a stand by skipping. During one of her jaunts outside of art class, she happens to save the President of the USA from a would be assasin. She ands up with a broken arm. She becomes a Hero, and her (horrible) school photo is plastered on newspapers across America. This apparently gives her sister liberty to torture her with beauty products. To top of all of the craziness, Sam can't decide who she likes more: her sister's boyfriend Jack or the President's son, David. Can Sam ever have a normal life is she is the world's only Teen Ambassador, is being stalked by the media, and might be in love with the son of the leader of the free world?"
4,Fun teenage romance!,"Samantha Madison is a typical misfit teenager until the day she inadvertently saves the President of the United States from an assassination attempt. Then her life changes in more ways than she could have imagined.I thought the characters were well-developed and realistic. Samantha especially was genuine and likeable. All American Girl is a fluffy, funny teenage romance that was great to listen to in the car."
1,Garbage,This book was nothing but sugary bubble gummy pop garbage forced upon us. I'm getting flashbacks from the Mediator Series (Shutter) I dont think that Meg Cabots book are realistic. Here are two main reasons why:1. The main character becomes teen ambassador to the UN. What?! Give me a break! In real life that would never happen!2. Sam was so winny! She wasn't even a strong character she was more like a big baby. WOW 10 reasons why her life was over: the the Presidents son liked her. oh boo hoo get over yourself. Isn't him liking her a good thing.I think this book needs to be put into the trash. Please do not read it at all. Seriously it stinks.
3,"I really like Meg, honest","OK, im not saying this book is pure pig swill, but its not what shes capable of. Ms Cabot is a brilliant author, im in awe of her funny, sweet quirky way of writing and the way that she creates the best men ever seen - or not - imagined then. Princess Diaries and the mediator are good and i know this is for younger readers, but i think that shes become a bit formulaic. Rebecca is just like Doc, Sam and Mia could sisters - except they couldn't becos no sisters are that alike...except maybe twins, and they're different ages...anyway. My point is that all of the characters are like what we've seen before, David = Michael. There are small differences but this just isn't enough to be un-predictable. Sorry to die hard fans - the book is ok, to maybe borrow from the library on a rainy weekend."
4,Does she have what it takes?,"If you like funny and hilarious stories you would have to read All American Girl written by Meg Cabot. Meg Cabot has been my number one author that I have dscovered. I have a lot of books and this one is my all time favorite. Samantha is the main character. She is like all of us, gets into trouble, plays, and the one big thing that she does is save the president. Sam has to change from a girl who wears all black to a girly-girl. If you lopve to laugh then this book is ment for you. If you like it so much Meg Cabot has a large collection of books displayed."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!,Have you ever felt that you were out of place... well Samantha Madison sure does. Her older sister is the most popular girl at school and her little sister is truly a genius. She feels her life is over until she suddenly saves the president's life and so she becomes the teen ambassador to the United States of America. This book shows how you should be happy you are yourself and be confident in yourself.
5,Hilarious!,"If you liked the Princess Diaries books, you'll love this too. All American Girl is just as good - if not better - as the Princess Diaries books. The main character, Samantha, stops an assanation plot - of the president of the United States. Now, Samantha is on the news, in the newspaper, and even invited to the White House! Samantha becomes good friends with the President's son...but it becomes a little more than a friendship quickly. *If you liked the Princess Diaries, you'll like this, and it isn't as nasty, as in dirty*"
4,Pretty darn good!,When I bought this book I thought that it would be a chick flick and would never get boring. I was right! This book is fantastic and grabs your attention. You get into it.
5,A definite must-read!,"All-American Girl was a fantastic book! I love Meg Cabot's books, but towards the last Princess Diaries book, it was getting a bit old. This book is full of laughs! I could not put it down. It is great if you just need a laugh. The main character, Samantha, doesn't really fit in anywhere and is constantly annoyed with her two perfect sisters. Then, when she is supposed to be in drawing class one day, a guy tries to shoot the president...but Sam jumps on him... and saves the president's life! From there, her life is filled with surprises she never would have dreamed of. All-American Girl is definitely something you should read!"
5,An Excellent book!,"Samantha is an outcast, and doesn't care. Her sister Lucy is the most popular girl in school, with a cute boyfriend, Jack, who Samantha likes. Her younger sister is a geinus. Suddenly her sister reports to her parents that shes been drawing her friends with celeberties, and they make her take art lessons. She saves the president outside of one, and everything changes for Sam.I recommend this to people who enjoyed the Princess Diarys. Just be aware that the book contains a little bit of inappropriate lanugage. I read this in 6th grade, and have read it several times since. I think this book is definitly worth buying!"
5,All American Girl,"Samantha Madison is in trouble at home and at school. She is selling celebrity portarits and not doing well in school. She is sent to an art school as a punishment, but she embarks on an interesting adventure. This was a very good book. I would recommend this book to readers of all ages. I liked this book because it was very funny. It's also about trusting yourself and friendship."
4,All- American Review,"If you like Princess Diaries then your bound to like All- American Girl written by Meg Cabot. Sam Madison is the middle child. She is not popular like her older sister and she is not a genius like her younger sister. One of her other problems is she has a crush on her older sister's boyfriend! So how does a girl like her end up teen ambassador to the UN? That just goes to show you you'll have to read this book to find out! I am 10 years old, I love to read, and this is on my top ten best books because Meg Cabot writes like the people in the story are your friend!"
4,1 star off for stereotyping...,"Cabot out did herself this time! She wrote a book that was the total opposite of her hit series: The Princess Diaries. Its quirky and fun. I took one star off for stereotyping how the ""All-American Girl"" should be."
3,"One you should read, but NOT the greatest","It's a so-so book... it's good and it'll keep you interested, some of the time... this book just doesn't stand in my mind as a modern masterpiece. Meg Cabot just didn't work magic over me in this one but i definitely think you should read it... it's a good one to take while waiting for another!"
3,Cute read but don't expect too much,"When I got this book, I was expecting a light hearted read, nothing too major. And I wasn't surprised, yet I was a bit disappointed. It's a cute book, but awfully predictable and I wished Meg Cabot would have gone more in depth with some of the side conflicts, while instead she just focused on the main issue (girl trying to get boy) and kind of ignores the possibilty for a more interesting story. Its more of a book you would borrow from a friend instead of buying at the store - and I still wouldn't suggest it over the Princess Diaries."
4,All-American Girl,"Samantha was never an average teenager. Then she saves the President from assination and becomes a national hero. Now she really isn't normal. She hates all the press that hide in her bushes and she hates now being the teen ambassador to the United Nations. She begins to date the President's son, David. Then David and Samantha break up because David finds that Samantha likes her sister's boyfriend, Jack. Samantha has such a crazy life she doesn't know who to ask for advise. She decides to ask her art teacher who gives her the best advise, to follow her heart. She does just that and everything works out in the end."
4,All American Girly Book!!,"All American Girl written by Meg Cabot is a very good book. The main character in this book is named Samantha Madison. She is the middle child and she really feels it, with a super smart little sister and a totally popular older sister. Samantha doesnt really fit in. After her older sister ratted her out on a little drawing business she was running, she was forced to stop and take art lessons twice a week at Susan Boone's Art Studio. In her very first lesson she was embarassed by the teacher so she decided to skip the second lesson. Well, it's a good thing she did because she made history. National News!! Read this book to find out what happens. All American Girl is filled with laughter, sadness, and a national crush. This book is wonderful for all girls in their pre-teens and teens. Meg Cabot is very fun and witty in this book. I hope that you will take the time to read this laugh out loud book!"
4,"finally, a light-hearted novel with some actual heart","I truly appreciate Meg Cabot. Her books are funny, unrealistic, and light hearted. The topics she chooses are original, and her writing is clean and believable. While not packing the same ammount of laughter as Georgia Nicholson, Cabot manages to give something different to her novels--heart.This, by far is the most entertaining of Cabot's books that I've read--packed with hilarity, cleverness, and her signature unrealistic situations, All American girl is a settled down cozy read with a slightly cranky teenage heroine that you can't help laughing out loud at. The characters are pretty well developed, and the premise--an average girl who saves the first son is just far enough out of the box to work. It's a curl down under the covers read that will easily be devoured in one sitting--perfect for a rainy day."
4,Princess Diaries Again,"This book is good and it has a good plot. Sam is a teen, who finds herself saving the president, and is turned into the nations hero. This book is a lot like the Princess Diaries series, because both Sam and Mia are unpopular, have stong opinoins on things, and are made fun of by the ""popular kids"".They both also find themselves liking popular boys, but changing thier minds, and going for someone else. This is a good book for anyone who likes Prinncess Diaries."
3,Didn't I already read this?,"If you liked The Princess Diaries, I can almost guarantee that you'll like All-American Girl. Take Mia Thermopolis. Change her into a lost artist named Sam. Have her save the president and and become teen ambassador to the UN and BOOM! A new book based on the same storyline. The fact that Sam was completely clueless about what was in front of her drove me crazy. I have to say, I was disappointed with Meg Cabot's work on this one."
3,"A great story, but...","There were some not-so-childish parts. But if your parents let you read anything, then this is an awesome book! It has a great plot, strong characters...and even a little romance!"
1,Look else where,"I'll just come out and say it, this book was terrible. Unlike the Princess Diaries, which I couldn't put down, I had to force myself to read this book. After such a long wait, I fount nothing but disappointment. Cabot tries to make Sam as likeable as Mia, but it doesn't work. Sam a weak, watered down, shadow of Mia, with a lot of black clothes to fill in the blanks. Mia could be you or a best friend. Sam is definitely the type of girl you trip in the hallway at school. She's that annoying. If you were a fan of the Princess Diaries, I'd advise waiting for the fourth volume instead of wasting money on this book. If curiosity gets the best of you, just check it out from the library."
1,Worst Book Ever!,"I hated this book. As someone else had said, it was a replica to the Princess Diaries. Dont read it if u hate fictional stories.....this story would never happen in real life and its wicked weird!!!!"
4,Fluffy but fun,"After the last book, I really wanted a light read, and that's just what I got with this book. Yes, it was very predictable, but that's what I wanted and I had fun reading it."
2,Hard to buy storyline&#65533;,"As someone who has read many YA books, I have to admit this one doesn't stand out, except maybe for the sheer outrageousness of the storyline. Samantha Madison is teenage artist living in Washington, D.C. One day while skipping her art classes her parents force her to attend she inadvertently saves the president's life. Along with her newfound celebrity comes...yup, you guessed it, a romance with the president's son. I could see most ""twists"" in the story from a mile away. I do like the minor plot about art however."
