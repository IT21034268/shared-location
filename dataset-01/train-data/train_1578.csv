2,Do not recommend buying,"I've done a lot of workout videos, taken aerobics classes and had years of dance, but I thought the cardio portions of this video were hard to follow. The instructor doesn't take the time to show you the move before launching into it -- she just calls out the move and expects you to follow. Also, I have to agree with another reviewer who noted that proper form is not clearly demonstrated, especially for weights and cardio. I think that makes it much too easy to get hurt. It would have also been helpful to have another person with her demonstrating level one, while she did level two. It's a good workout, but wasn't fun for me because I worried about injury and it wasn't easy to follow in certain portions. I would not recommend buying this video."
3,"Not my favorite workout, but not my worst either","I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews here. This workout is not for beginners. I liked the way it is broken into 10 sections, but I have a history of back problems, and while I was working out to this DVD, I could actually feel my back pulling, and I had to stop. I did use the weights, but I had to modify it to my level of exertion. I basically stayed on level 1, even though she encourages you to try level 2. If anyone has back or knee problems, approach this workout with caution.This workout video also includes a booklet for a metabolism boosting meal plan which is based on a 1400 calorie daily intake. I found it to be higher in protein. It kind of reminded me of the Zone diet. I don't think that it would be a hard meal plan to follow, but it's not something I think I could stay with for a very long time."
3,Adequate Workout. But Don't Rush Out and Buy It.,I gave this to my wife to view and use to see if it was worth using. Her thoughts were that is an adequate workout but that's it. So many workout videos and dvds make strong promises about their product. But in the end the majority are not worth the hype. The only thing that makes this dvd special is the fact that everything is laid out in logical order.But the bottom line is your looking at your standard workout video.
2,"Good sweat, but not for beginners","I workout several hours a week and I teach a fitness class five days a week. I enjoyed this workout and I got a good sweat out of it. This is a challenging workout. The title and some of the language used by the instructor make it sound like it is aimed for a beginner.The workout is broken down into several sections, and the user can break it down and sequence it to match available time and choice of body parts.The exercises are demonstrated quickly, and only shown at one level. Modifications and accommodations are not shown or explained. Many moves involve jumping up and down or side to side. Weights are used, but the instructor does not discuss how to use them safely. The transitions between exercises are quick.If you are experienced at working out, this is a good DVD. It's good to have for those times when you cannot get to the health club. If you are not already in good condition, do not get this DVD. This is not a beginner workout."
5,Changing it to five stars,Changing it to five stars after having done it several times. I enjoy this DVD. I thought it was a good intermediate workout. She cues well. There are a good number of reps to tire muscles without getting boring. I enjoyed the instructor. It was a good length. The only thing I wasn't sure of is that she says to take a couple days off between workouts. I workout almost every day and didn't think this was harder than other DVDs. I used to do firm videos but really have enjoyed branching out to others like this without sacrificing a good hard workout.
4,pretty good work out,"I wish it wasn't quite so long, but it is a good workout and the time goes fast. I like that she constantly reminds the viewer to tighten their abs. I forget after a while, so someone who tells me frequently is good because I'll be able to maintain proper form throughout the exercise, not just at first. I definitely felt like I had worked out after doing this. Whether or not it will actually boost my metabolism remains to be seen."
1,Caveat Emptor,"In an unprecedented event with bluetooth headsets, Jabra has been besieged by JX-10 fakes flooding the market and being sold on many sites as the genuine article. These fakes are very convincing, almost defying detection, almost, but there are ways to tell the difference if you know how. The one thing ALL of the knock-offs [reportedly believed to originate from China] miss is the quality in operation and side-by-side comparisons in aesthetics. It is much easier to copy appearance than function.Colored versions are a favorite of bogus units! While the Black may be legitimate, it can't be sold in the USA with a warranty. Other colors are generally bogus in ANY country or either hemisphere.If you purchase the unit above, you're entirely on your own. The one star is for *proceed with caution*.AX~"
3,Trusting your memory,"I remembered loving this album years ago when it came out. Apparently my tastes have changed over the years, as I wasn't as thrilled with the CD as I remembered being all those years ago. Still, there are some good cuts and overall I would have to say it's worth listening to."
4,Living history,"My sons enjoyed this video, which helped them to see from a settler's perspective what it was like to come to the New World. I would have liked more details, but it did keep their attention and bring history to life."
5,help me get it on dvd.,loved this show and now it is time for it to be brought back on dvd. please help the cause by review it over and over.
5,Great message even 40 years later,"This book was written in the 60's and I find that I really enjoy children's books from this time more than most contemporary stories. Perhaps I'm biased because I was born in the late 60's but it seems that many of the children's books from this era focus on humanity and one's contribution towards a better society as opposed to individual accomplishments. I think more focus should be on the ""we"" instead of ""me"" and what we can accomplish together. People often laugh at that concept and label it a hippie/peace-and-love thing but I think more books should tell that story. I highly recommend this book."
1,Save Your Money,Only an idiot would not already know the material presented here. Save your cash and use common sense.
2,The message of this book is simple: pay attention.,"All people are different, we like different things. This book is 1001 little quotes from different women. Some like this, some like that. If you're really out of touch, get it. Otherwise you won't read more than a couple of pages."
3,Sex Secrets: for men,"I read this to see just what they should know about us (I'm female) and was a little disappointed. Apparently almost nothing! The book for women was a little more informative, although a guy might not think so."
5,Interesting & educational,"I enjoyed reading this book. I found it to be both interesting and educational. This book includes interviews with many different women and it gets in detail as to what women really want. My boyfriend is no rookie, but after reading this book with me, he is certainly able to ROCK MY WORLD!. It's worth reading."
1,Perfect example of what is wrong with,Perfect example of what is wrong with Amazon's review system. Obviously none of the reviewers except phreaky66 has even looked at this book. It is nothing but page after page of one liners.
1,Like reading fan mail?,"I expected intamite encounters from people who are, or were close to Bob Dylan. In fact most of the stories were from finatic fans or groupies who had either only met him once or, in some cases, never. There were a few interesting stories, but not enough to make this book worth reading."
2,A dissapointment...,"This collection of stories was a disappointment, especially after reading the reviews. I was hoping for suspense, build-ups, clever plot twists and suprise endings, but no. The punch line is almost ALWAYS on the opening few pages of the stories. There are only three stories left to read, but I'd given up hoping they'd get better.It reads like he was making it up as he was going along. I wouldn't recommend this one, if you like plain-wrap, by the numbers horror, buy this book."
3,Learn Russian First,"This film is sort of a curiousity as it was Stalin's favorite movie and he even sent a copy of it to Franklin Roosevelt. For this reason, it's a nice one to have in a film collection. However, while the VHS version may have subtitles, this DVD version does not. The story of a town going to a music competition is not so complicated that it can't be followed, but it would be nice to know what they're saying. The sound quality is uneven in parts of the film and the last few minutes looks like it was restored from a different negative as the picture quality is a little grainy. The movie is entertaining, but subtitles would have made it better."
4,A Great Russian Musical,This is a very entertaining film and a fascinating look back at Russia in the 1930's. The folk-inspired music is wonderful.
3,Vegetarians will love it,This cookbook is for the true vegetarian who loves his/her vegies and likes to read a good story about the vegies they are cooking. I particularly like the fact that many of the recipes related to widely used ingredients such as tomotoes and potatoes. The new twist and flavours using this old basics from different regions around the world will give a zing to those vegetarians who don't like to stray too far from their favourite vegies.
4,Recommended for Cooks and Writers alike!,"I found The Vegetable Book to be a great intellectual resource of botanical as well as historical information regarding vegetables. Though the quantity of actual recepies for each category was kept at minimal, Colin Spencer's vegetable knowledge is indeed educational and recommended for cooks and writers alike. Highly applauded!"
2,Not to great just a another clone,"Well, i'd have to say i don't really enjoy this cd.The Casualties have the same boring ""Oi Punk"" sound as almost every bands in the 80's.Maybe if the were around then i'd spike my hair and yell senseless nonsense,but they werent.I don't find them to be talented at all, and their lyrics are very unoriginal.I would say lame. All and all I would say save your money and don't buy this boring cd. Thanx-Your Pal Mr.Winkie"
2,"Frustrating, dated, but there it is...","This album contains a couple of classic tunes marred by rather painful and dated synth sounds. Punk Jazz heard elsewhere is great (ex. by Jaco Pastorius Big Band), but here I can barely tolerate it, simply because of the setting. It's pretty 70's sounding...cheesy in the extreme by today's standards. Somehow the other WReport in the Jaco years albums don't sound this bad. Save this one for last...."
3,Shades of brilliance lost in monotonous overdubs,"I recall very well the one-star review this album received in Downbeat. The members of W.R., especially Joe Zawinul weren't too pleased with that review. Although I have never felt as negatively as that reviewer, this album nevertheless has fallen quite short of other W.R. offerings, most notably Heavy Weather, Black Market, and a good rebound effort in Night Passage. The Prophet 10 synth layers put down by Zawinul sound simply cheesy to me. Jaco and Wayne certainly shine the best they can in this setting, but the writing isn't the best, and where great ideas are introduced, they aren't developed sufficiently. Far and away my favorite track is Wayne Shorter's Pinocchio, which has truly great synth textures, and superb all around execution. But alas, it's so short. Any W.R. is a joy for me to listen to, but I agree with Zawinul that this album is their least memorable. I recommend the other albums mentioned above, far above this one."
4,Exentric album,"Eventhough other people claim otherwise, this is a Weather Report album and not a Zawinul egotrip. Eventhough Wayne Shorter and Jaco Pastorius are in the background, they both had alot of influance. Jaco Pastorius was even given credit as a co-producer to this album, alongside Zawinul, by Zawinul himself. This album shows a different side of Weather Report, but a great weather report none the less."
2,NOT Weather Report's best,"Weather Report made many interesting (and some great) albums during their career, whether or not they fit cleanly into the ""jazz"" category. However, this album is neither interesting nor even good. Sadly enough, despite the considerable talents of the musicians (Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul and Jaco Pastorius!!) this album consists largely of experiments that DON'T work.Granted, there is an interesting moment here and there...but be forewarned. Even if you have no problem with so-called ""commercial"" music (and as an admirer of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Beatles, etc.; I don't) this is not the Weather Report recording to get. ""Black Market"" and ""Heavy Weather"" are much better choices for Weather Report's ""commercial"" albums."
3,Picture on listing wrong,"The picture on this listing is wrong. The listing is for a red sox HAT, not a baseball. I recieved the hat and notified the seller that the picture was wrong. I decided to keep the hat because it's actually pretty cute. It's glass and shiny and a good size ornament, about as big as a 3-3.5 inch glass ball ornament. I only gave it a three because the listing was wrong and I would liked to get the baseball, but it was unavailable."
5,Mathematics deserves four colour,"I must admit I was looking for more detail from this book than it contains. I was looking for more detail on hexagonal systems.Instead there is less detail and less formal mathematics. I found it to be rather similar to other publications by Ian Stewart, such as the book Fearful Symetry which contains many of the same ideas.Despite my personal desires I am glad to see that Ian has finally been granted lots and lots of expensive four colour illustrations with which to explain how interesting mathmatics really is.I immediately found a use for it in the workshops I run for children. It is the best illustrated book Mr Stewart has yet produced."
4,"Nice, but not ""magical""...","In the long search for a better shaving experience I gave a try to this brand whole line of products - bought this one, plus the Hidroplane (shaving cream) and after-shave. Liked the perfume and ""touch"" of all, but maybe biased by some ""too wonderful"" reviews I expected more. And in fact I would like to make clear that this is a cream that does not produce foam - a system that I personally don't adapt well to. Maybe this was my major issue, as I feel it takes longer to shave with such systems and hate to waste time on it: I'm a ""quality+time spent"" oriented type of guy. It does give a nice warm sensation, but I doubt there's any functional benefit got from it..."
2,Gobal Warming It Ain't,"Like many,, I succumbed to the selling hype and the promise of a real ""hot towel"" experience and the smoothest shave ever. No matter how I applied the Billy J. Hot Towel Pre-Sahve, I could not get more than a seconds' worth of warmth.The warming sensation was so short that I never could feel it over my entire shaving area.I suppose I would have forgiven the unfulfilled promise of a hot towel if I had gotten the smoothest glide possible with my razor but such was not the case. At best it was equal to all other similar products with the exception of King of Shaves Kinesium which is head an shoulders above any other pre shave products regardless of price. If there is a theoretical limit to how smooth a shave can be, Kinesium comes closest to approaching that limit. You don't always get what you pay for unless you like to impress your friends with the colloection of expensive products you have in your medicine cabinet."
2,disappointed,"This stuff is okay, but not worth the price for me. The heat feeling is nice, but it doesn't do anything for the comfort of the shave itself. I expected a better experience."
2,"Just used, more of a gimmick than quality pre-shave","I just tried this product for the first time. It may work great with their hydroplane shave product, but i prefer a heavy lather so i used it with edwin jagger shave cream/brush and a merkur DE safety razor. I usually shave right out of the shower so i was disappointed when the warming sensation was short lived and barely noticeable. As for the quality and closeness of the shave, there was absolutely no improvement. I did my usual three reduction passes, and the final product was, if anything, rougher than normal.For the price and quality this wont be making it into my shave routine."
2,"Like a splash of hot water, seriously","This was a father's day splurge, purchased with the more highly rated hydroplane shaving cream. Although the hot towel treatment cleverly creates a burst of exothermic heat on my face, the sensation is fleeting and unfortunately not worth anything near what I paid for it. If you get your face wet enough, and you put enough of the cream in your hand, and you get the cream to your wet face, you will feel two to five seconds of heat. Not a chemical kind of burn, but genuine heat. I found that it is almost identical to splashing hot water on my face. Now, the second aspect of this product is that it feels like a clean, lightweight lotion. I've tried shaving with it and without it, with dull blades, with sharp blades. I think it might improve my shave, though minimally. Lastly, the product smells good. It smells better than the hydroplane cream. That's it. Neat how they did that, but don't buy it."
3,Good stuff,"Nice smell, really makes you face smooth and easy to shave.Mixed 1/2 & 1/2 with Billy Jealously shave cream.Only complaint - not very visible (not foamy)to track your shave."
3,Lots of Errors,"I am using this book to study for the GMAT because it was the cheapest one available. But as I'm going through the problems and answers, I am finding a mistake on almost every page - in the problems and the answers. This makes it a little bit difficult for someone who is not very great at math to study and understand the concepts."
5,Never gets old; still a great tool,"I've had PP 8 for four years now. Time and again I've tried software from other vendors (yes, even Photoshop!!!), but this baby is still one of the most versatile applications I own. Its dependable, like an old tool in the garage. No workshop should be without it. Its user interface is still so easy and quick, yet so professional. Though it lacks the extreme high-end things in Adobe and some of the others, it is my old standby for digital editing and correction. Sure, you can shell out hundreds for the big name ...but this product stands its own ground and will never let you down. I paid much more for it when it was first available, and it is a STEAL at its current price. I have used this product for business and personal use and it is timeless. Get it while you still can!"
3,It's ok...,"First off, let me say that this gun looks and feels great. Mostly metal with a very solid feel. If you're looking for a gun that will impress your friends and look great on a shelf somewhere, this is it. In combat, however, it doesn't stand up so well. The battery charges fast, but wears out even faster. It sounds impressive, and just the intimidation factor can be a major help. This also, however, doesn't last long. You can play maybe one game before your buddies start to realize that your ""awesome"" gun only fires about once every five shots. It doesn't even do much better on single shot. Do yourself a favor; buy something worth the money, because this isn't."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Hontesly, I thought when I had to buy six packages what if I don't like this. But it is wonderful. It tastes and has the texture of regular pasta. A low carb ready made that is good."
3,Mixed bags,"I love that this is high protein, high fiber, low carb. Great nutritional content, and much cheaper than the grocery store. I have purchased this pack of 6 twice. I would give the first order 5 stars, but I give this order 2 stars. The reason: the second order was well within the expiration date, but has a musty smell. It tastes ok, but even after being cooked still has a musty smell. I will probably order again, but maybe try a different seller. In sum, I would recommend this product, but the quality was not consistent."
5,Great taste for a low carb option!,"Even though a few of the bags were ripped and the noodles spilled into the box, these were a great find. It is very hard to find decent tasting pasta / noodles for a low carb lifestyle and these are delicious! Taste like egg noodles to me!"
4,Acceptable Option,"Still debating whether Dream Fields Pasta is better than Al Dente Carba-Nada Egg Fettuccine, 10-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6). I have tried their different kinds and I find them to be an acceptable option and to me much better than regular pasta. I am happy that another low carb pasta is available for purchase for it is to my advantage to eat the low carb pasta. The last time I had regular pasta was a long time ago. Between the two pastas mentioned above I no longer feel I am missing much. 4 Stars!"
3,Carba-Nada Yeahrightsure,"I am a diabetic and for a ""carba-nada"" product 4 ounces blew my blood sugar through the roof. I still give the product a 3 because the taste and texture is quite good - for a non-diabetic!!! My wife and family eat it."
4,Like it!,Great alternative to heavy flour noodles and i would recommend these to anyone try to a low carb diet as well
1,just awful,"loving fettuccine and being diabetic i have been looking for a fettuccine i could eat,i was so excited when i saw this product on amazon,i purchased the 6 bag package of Al Dent-Carba Nada,i cant express my disappointment when i cooked it for dinner,stating it was awful is an understatement....It tasted like i was eating a cardboard box and no matter how much cheese i put on it didn't help the flavor. I am now stuck with 5 1/2 bags and a big waste of my hard earned money. Do I recommend this product......NOT in a million years save your money. hopefully i will find a flavorful product and soon.Anyone need 5 1/2 bags of....insulation....... j.sorenson"
2,Defeats its purpose,I have bought many wonderful Roach albums and I have bought some bad ones. This is one of the bad ones. The whole drone background effect is destroyed by an ascending melody line on the first half of this piece. Melody and beat is anathema to ambient music as it leads to expectation and predictability. The melody line ceases half way through but it sure is annoying. I would have preferred 70 minutes of gently washing and shifting drones. A waste of my money.
1,Mind-numbing,I know this stuff is supposed to be mind-numbing but it should not be as mind-numbingly boring and irritating as this is. The major problems with it appears to be the absence of good ideas or genuine emotional content. If you want something to send you to sleep then this may do the job (although it wouldn't work with me because of the irritation factor) but if you want ambient sound while you are working I suggest you try Brian Eno.
2,BORING,"Basically, this is ONE FULL HOUR of ambient ""synth"". With a few clicks and clacks thrown in for good measure. There's no variation, no theme, no escalating moments. Just mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm for a full hour. I guess it's not bad if you need some background noise for something, but even that there's better albums out there. Tim Hecker's ""Harmony in Ultraviolet "" is a really good example of that. It's ""ambient noise"", but it really flows well and just sounds great. It seems like Steve Roach could take some lessons from him, as this album is pure boredom."
3,eno didn't like it that much...,"brian is not amused when you compare this roach release to any of his (brian's) early ambient pieces. yes, the music is repetitive, but it lacks an underlying dynamic. having said that, roach's lush orchestration is impeccable. the music can be improved, amazingly, by converting the sound file to a TIFF file, uploading it into photoshop, and tweaking the contrast, levels and saturation adjustments a bit. then, convert back to WAV format and enjoy."
3,2 WORDS EDITED OUT OF THE FIRST MUSIC VIDEO!!!!!!!,"BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS ITEM!!!! Bought this video thinking the music videos would be complete and un-edited. The first song ""MY HAPPY ENDING"" has 2 words cut out of it. I think that's terrible. We should be able to buy an artists music video collection WITHOUT words being cut from their songs. It's very disruptive to the song and it's continuity. The rest of the songs were UNCUT. Still love you though AVRIL!"
3,I don't really understand.,"I just bought this DVD at Wal-Mart today since it was only 5.88$, but I don't understand the purpose of it. Just the title ""My Favorite Videos (So Far)"" is pretty unorganized. It has five videos. My Happy Ending, Don't Tell Me, Sk8er Boi (Live), Losing Grip, Sk8er Boi. I don't understand why they didn't just make two different dvd's, one with videos from her first cd, one with videos from her second, one with live videos. Why a ""favorite video"" DVD? I still enjoyed the few videos that was on it however."
5,A Pre-publishers review of the Dartist,"This book is an intriging story which embodies more of the author's personal experiences than it would appear evident from the book. The things depicted are closer to reality than to fiction. The events are masked to cover the actuality and while they are somewhat changed they still portray events close to what may have taken place. Obviously the experience and background of the author are revealed in the story line. It makes for a fascinating and exciting trip though a series of events which not everyone has or will ever have the opportunity to engage in. It represents a time, not too long ago, when things in the world of espionage and intrigue were quite different than they are at the present time. In some ways perhaps the author is gld that things have changed. Anyone with a military background or interest should read this book because it reveals things that they all probably knew about but never had confirmed."
5,Please Remaster,"SONY - Please Remaster and re-release this brilliant record. By far the best of Art's mostly mediocre solo output. The production and the songwriting - ah, yes - the sublime songwriting by Jimmy Webb - at the top of his game - is fantastic. Art perfectly capture's Jimmy's angst- ridden lyrics and his voice is never better. This a stone classic that has never aged. I'd love to hear it using the best of today's mastering technolgy. Sony - I can guarentee you one sale right here."
5,"Sophisticated, thoughtful pop","Watermark is one of the most intelligent, lovely albums made in the 1970s, a reminder that not all was disco or sappy ballads. Garfunkel joins Linda Ronstadt as one of the great interpreters of Webb's pensive and often demanding songs. Webb was involved in this production and it shows: the arrangements are classy and never intrusive. The CD's best cuts include the first song, ""Crying In My Sleep,"" with wonderful wordplay (watch Webb toy with the various meanings of ""ran"" in one of the verses), the Celtic ""All My Love's Laughter"" (with a little musical help from the Chieftains), and ""Mr. Shuck and Jive"" with its jazzy arrangement and embittered lyric. The title track features haunting imagery (Webb is an imagist like Dylan and Joni Mitchell--he tends to think in pictures), and there's a surreal quality to the arrangement on ""Wooden Planes,"" a great song best done by B.J. Thomas."
5,Still Art's Best Effort,"It took Art Garfunkel a year to record this beautiful album but it was well worth the effort. Recording took place all over the world, just to get into the right mood.Art Garfunkel interpreting Jimmy Webb - who wrote all of the 12 tracks on this album - is a moving experience. I have a lot of fond memories playing this over and over again as a vinyl record in 1977 and a lot of later years, and I am glad I could replace it with this CD.In my opinion, this still stands as Art Garfunkel's best album to date."
5,glad to see it finally on cd!,"Beautiful songs, Jimmy Webb's words and Art Garfunkle always unique voice what a pair these two make. After almost 20 years I'm glad that those who make the decisions about what albums go to cd finally saw the light."
4,Wonderful music,"I love Art Garfunkel's music. His voice is one of the greatest lyric tenor voices of our age. I've heard people say that he was just along for the ride when he was the second half of Simon & Garfunkel. But who was the featured voice in ""Bridge Over Troubled Water""? Art Garfunkel. Why? Because he has the ""chops"" to carry that most beautiful melody in a flawless performance. ""Watermark"" is yet another example of the fresh and wonderful treatment of great arrangements. His voice sails in such a way as to carry the listener to some distant land of beauty and peace. I loved this album when I first bought it on LP. I love it still as a CD."
3,Art webbed,"Surely the singular sensuous voice of Art Garfunkel seeked the same sorta symphonic operatic lyrics written by his best friend/collaborative Paul Simon..But! Jimmy Webb, the most celebrated pop song writer of the 60's 70's, with written hits ""Up and Up and Away"", ""MacAthur Park"", ""Galvaston"", Witicha Lineman"", etc..made a song cycle with this album.This is the album that Art Garfunkel and Jimmy Webb wanted to make. An ache a take of broken heart from the first drink to the last damn it all done.Art lingers over Jimmy's lyrics like Frank Sinatra does over Sammy Vaughn/etc..This is a classic break-up album, full of cigs stubbed out in an ashtray legged like white octopuses arms waving each way and another."
4,Get it,"It works great (although I had to close the chain end with some pliers a little to fit through my weights) I love pull-ups even more because of this product.Another note: some may need to hook the chain on the cloth to fit large amounts of certain weights, depending on their volume, but it still works great."
2,eh,"The product sits precariously on your hips since you can't adjust at the hips...as noted by myself and several people that used it. The length of chain is short and does not accomodate large weights easily despite the picture shows the man dipping with two large weights. But it does it's job, I guess."
2,Not worth more than $20,"I was so excited to get this and was very surprised at how small it was. The 'diamonds' are more like diamond dust or diamond chips and in all honesty the setting is more sparkely than the diamonds are. It is pretty and I am sure it will look nice on but my first impression was ""OH! This is all it is?!"""
4,Mayfield 4/Fallout is an excellent CD,"After listening to this CD and experiencing all the tracks, I would recommend it to anyone that likes new rock music. Don't Walk Away is getting lots of air play on many radio stations, but there are some other really good songs on this CD. Track 8 is awesome. Worth listening to over again. These guys have it going on and will be a big hit. That's my prediction. BUY IT!"
5,The Mayfield Four,"Fall Out by The Mayfield Four is brilliant, anyone who likes good rock music will love this. If you like to sing-a-long whilst driving, this is the one for you, very classy rock tunes, I suggest you get hold of a copy of this!FalloutAlso ' We buy music ' deal with decent goods and will get it to you quickly, recommend them too."
3,Un libro repetitivo,"La primera mitad del libro es repetitiva y un poco aburrida, a los 10 protagonistas les pasa lo mismo y ""nadie"" se da cuenta, la segunda mitad del libro es la que vale la pena leer, y además no hay que leer toda la primera mitad para entender la segunda mitad, por otro lado es un libro fácil y rápido de leer."
2,Over Produced Latin Music,I was disappointed with this CD compared to the reviews it received from Amazon and others. The music sounds tin-y and small as if from one synth keyboard. The music evokes little more than imagining what the recording studio looked like where it was produced.Melodies sound too similar from song to song and the entire effort is undermined by a lack of excitement in the rhythm.
4,Dinosaur fans rejoice !,"Enter the prehistoric world of dinosaurs... Simply wanderaround the VR museum and click on the exhibits...easy user interface!Amazing animations and special 3D animations makes learning about dinosaur easy. Moving around is easy ! In fact, this CD- rom is like playing an educational title of MYST. Many 3D models to thrill and excite dinosaur fans. There's even a dig site to find dinosaur bones to bring them back to life! The perfect CD-rom for anyone who likes or is interested in dinosaurs."
3,Just OK,I ordered this to replace an earlier version which we couldn't get to work on XP. This version worked on XP. After all the hassle with the earlier version my grandson had lost his enthusiasm for the game. Maybe he will look at it again at a later time.
3,They pill quickly,The sheets started to pill after just a few days of use and remained so after cleaning. Not what we expected
5,Great sheet set,"These are great sheets that aren't going to break the bank. After buying cheapy sheets for college, I decided to buy a nice set for my new house and bed. I haven't regretted any part of it! They are nice to sleep on, but wrinkle like crazy. Also, there is a little area that has some minor pilling, but it isn't a big deal. Maybe I pick at it in my sleep. I bought two sets and love them."
5,Better than a fancy hotel,The recipient of this gift told me he'd never seen such nice sheets even in a fancy hotel. What a great price for such a high thread count.
2,not very sturdy,The price is good but don't expect them to last long. They are comfortable but thin & I alread have a seam that is separating after about 5 weeks
1,"Product disappointing, customer service worse","The sheets were deep pocketed as stated but product started pilling after 2 washing's not what you would expect from 600-thread-count Egyptian Cotton. After Amazon contacted Company for the RA they first wanted a picture, then asked for comments on how it was laundered. Who knows what is next. Because Amazon had limited selection of the type of sheet I wanted available that was fulfilled by them, I selected an independent vendor-BIG MISTAKE."
3,Description unclear,"The description for the set did not make it clear that pillowcases were included. As a result, I purchased a set of pillow cases unnecessarily. That said, the quality of the product seems good at, with pillow cases included, a good price."
1,very deceptive offer,"Very deceptive, I did not order when I found out this : it says ""bed sheet set"", value over $100, sale price 15 or so, ""you save 90%"". In reality, the sheets are no longer available, it's only the pillow cases.Such scam should not be allowed."
1,Not Worth the Cost!!,"These sheets are rough, wrinkly, and smell like they were chemically processed. The color I chose was mocha, I expected a dark chocolate what I got was watered down chocolate milk. It is actually gross. I hate to use that word but it is exactly what comes to mind when I look at the color. I washed with fabric softener in the washer and two dryer sheets to soften, did NOT help at all!! Feels like cheap polyester not like costly 600 thread count Egyptian cotton as advertised! After wash/dry they still smell like super glue. Once you open the package you cannot return the product. There goes $120 I should have stuffed into a pillow to lay on it would have been more comfortable. Touch test before you buy! I cannot stress that you should actually touch sheets before buying. You are laying your skin against them every night. If you want to be satisfied and not surprised by the quality or lack thereof of sheets do not buy online. Lesson learned!"
1,Very disappointed,"These sheets are very thin and scratchy, even after being laundered. Also, the fitted sheet is not big enough to fit a 22"" mattress.I am going to try and return them.--------------------------------------Update: the seller gave me a significant refund."
2,Shrinks! One corner of fitted always unsecure,"We ordered these in February this year, but I wanted to wait a while to write a review as time does indeed tell. . . These sheets feel thick and great. A heavy cotton that I like. However, they have shrunk so much that I cannot get the 4th corner of fitted sheet over my deep mattress. I tug it as much as possible and it stays pretty secure 1/2 way down the mattress, but that's not really what you want in a fitted sheet, therefore 2 stars."
2,PEDALS DON'T FIT,"The bike is shipped in its original package so it was ripped, crushed and dirty by the time I got it. It is as advertised except that the pedals will not screw on. I had to take it to a bike shop to have them enlarge the holes and buy new pedals. Better to buy this item from a store (with the same price) and have them put it together for you."
1,As if someone hasn't figured this out?!,How can the company sell these bikes & not know that the pedals are too big & do not fit? It's rediculous to sell something that has to be modified in order to use it! Why put any pedals in with it at all then?! Worthless... Do not waste your money on a defective exspensive bike.
3,Pretty Bike--,The bike is very cute for a toddler girl just learning to ride. The front wheel is extremely hard to get on. Not a very quick project to assemble.
2,Useless,"If you had problem with conception for some time, chances are that you already did your 'homework' and read about all possible causes and treatment on the Internet, or discussed it with your doctor. This book is a very general summery of infertility problems, and mainly a big ad for the authors' treatment plan that is available, I assume, in the hospital where they work. I would not recommend this book to anybody - you can definitely find more useful info online, and definitely cheaper!"
1,"""just relax and you'll get pregnant?""","This comes so dangerously close to blaming infertility on things like inability to relax. How many IVF and other patients with serious medical conditions have had the insulting advice, ""if you just relax you'll get pregnant"". The best advice anyone can get is to get to a top quality medical specialist as soon as possible, not to get distracted or be given false hope by this nonsense."
5,A Very Good Guide for Those Starting A Family,"The book has two key points. The first key point is that small lifestyle changes can improve the fertility of a couple. for example, stopping cigarette smoking, keeping body weight in a normal range, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake can all improve fertility. The second key point is that stress and fertility problems are often related. Stress can cause fertility problems. Infertility problems and treatment can cause emotional stress. The book outlines many excellent ways to reduce stress and improve fertility. Dr. Domar is an expert on stress and fertility problems. I highly recommend the book."
2,So-So,"Some tips for increasing fertility - avoiding tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and stress...hmmm. Well, I'm still waiting for someone i.e., a medical professional, to write a book about why some women who DO smoke cigarettes regularly, drink coffee and consume alcohol on a fairly frequent basis have no problem whatsoever conceiving. I'm more interested in having that mystery solved. Fertility aside, I already know that tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and stress are not good for you."
2,So So,Does not really have a lot of informative information. The information given is pretty basic and bland. Thers are a lot of other books available that provide more.
1,has a religious slant and it's very simplistic,"This book takes a long time to tell parents the obvious fact that they should spend a lot of time with their 6 to 12s, doing fun activities, as well as really communicating with them, because as we all know after age 12, children are a lot less likely to listen to their parents.Also, there is a little religion along the way, which, as an agnostic, I didn't like very much."
1,Sub-par quality clips for premium money,"This collection was a real dissapointment. Many of the clips are too small to be useful, or of very low quality. Very few were of sufficient quality to be used in an informal presentation, much less professional graphic work. Many appeared to be bad sketch-work that had been scanned, then poorly cropped. Some pieces might be useful for those who need seals/symbols for specific agencies or commands, but even these are low quality, and can be obtained easily from the agencies websites."
2,A really good idea AND a really bad idea,"If you are always going to be bringing your boat onto a ramp with a slight grade & smooth water, these work great. However, if you are coming onto a ramp with a steep grade and/or the lake is windy/wavy, you may find your boat riding on top of the vertical guide posts & putting some nice dents in your pontoons. I found this out the hard way.In all fairness, I was not using this brand, but same design. I am going back to the outside (taller) guides to prevent this happening again."
3,Not as expected,"The C.E. Smith Pontoon Past Guide-On came very quickly which was good. However, the parts did not all fit together so we had to send it back....and was charged a 30% return fee!"
1,Poor education,The author is profoundly and deeply ignorant. Jerusalem was a capital of the state of Israel in 1000 BC. Poor education in Middle East history is a typical problem with American academy controlled by Arab money.
1,every bit of advice is either awful or obvious,"She completely contradicts herself many times, and write either blatantly obvious cliches like ""don't be afraid to try new things!"" or just plain stupid advice like ""wait until you get there to clothes shopping, so you can see what other people are wearing."" The style is written such that one would think her target audience is ten year olds rather than 17-18 year olds. Over all, a painfully awful read. Please don't waste your time and money."
4,"Eh. Best for People entering college, that are kinda naive.","Good info, but its more of life skills, I think this would be a great read for girls that have not had alot of tribulation in their lives. not so good for girls that have had to grow up before there time."
1,Terrible,"This is a shallow, face value interpretation of one's own point of view of college. Maynigo seems to make assumptions about her own college experience, stating they apply for everyone. In addition, the narrow scope addresses only the stereotypical men and women who attend college. She even devotes three and a half pages to naming stereotypes of different ""types"" of men in college. She suggests that students deal with roommate issues by complaining ""enough"" and getting mommy and daddy involved, rather than handling it in a mature manner and going through the appropriate channels - an RA. This is a terrible book for young women preparing for college. It doesn't deserve even one star. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS BOOK."
1,It's not worth reading!!!,"I don't recommend reading this book. I don't agree with the tips. The tips are a bit immature. I'm not a party girl and this book makes it seem like college is all about partying, guys, etc. College should be about education!!!.....not the social life."
5,Daughter starting college!,I bought my daughter 12 books to fill her in on all he stuff with college ....Good book lots of information. Very Happy with purchase!~ Good price arrive quickly I would recommend this seller!~
3,It was okay,It mostly included stuff common sense should tell you but it did have a few novel ideas.
3,pretty typical stuff,"Nothing new in this book, but it still is probably interesting to those going to be away from home for the first time."
5,Delightful Favorites,"You have a million different dessert choices,and they all seem good. Making these indulgent foods isn't always easy, and often time consuming. Jell-O takes minutes in its basic form.Jell-O's great for those with numerous allergies too!It doesn't have the seven most common allergens, WHEAT, SOY, DAIRY, TREE NUTS, SHELL FISH, and EGGS. Jell- O has no hydrogenated ingredients, and its calorie content is less than the majority of desserts, on the market. Sensitive stomachs can rejoice, with this berry delight."
4,Highland Christmas,I found the album a very refreshing type of Christmas Album. It gave you a very different rendition of the traditional Christmas Tunes. it was not too heavy on the Bagpipes while integrating some interesting nature sounds.If you are fond of Celtic music. It is a must for your collection
1,It tastes very bland,"Why did they not republish the first edition that tasted of strawberries and cheese. This new version, with it's claims of a ""lighter nuttier"" taste, is plain awful"
2,Didn't work on my 1995 like it said it would,Suppose to work with a 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee...it didn't for me. Sent back and refunded promptly. Would have been nice if it would have worked...
5,Classic album outta Stockton!,This album is one of the Best to ever come out of the 209 area. Dont pass this up cause it's really rare. Every song is Bangin! Mel is the MAD SCIENTIST cause he can Flip different styles. Very Solid album and well worth the Money... If you Can Find it!
4,Excellent true-to-nature bird sounds ..,"I stumbled upon this CD at a ""nature store"". Based on past experience many of these so-called Nature CDs are far from genuine. I was surprised by this production put out by an outfit called North Sound. The quality is very good. The selection of bird songs is quite varied and will give you a broad spectrum of this beautiful gift of nature. I am VERY pleased that ALL the sounds on this CD are nature's music. There is no annoying instrumentation to bore you and render the work banal. The segment on Smoky (sic) Mountain Meadow is fantastic. The quality is so good that occasionally I will get a couple of birds (don't know type!), on my patio querying about! My one quibble is that the length is only 58 minutes. By the time one gets synchronized to the sounds, alas; the CD is over. All in all a great buy and well worth having."
1,Too bad a ZERO isn't possible!,"I took the GMAT yesterday and I wish I had read these reviews beforehand!The questions in the verbal section were, as others have noted, EXTREMELY arbitrary. I was consistently scoring dismally low (55-65%) on the practice exams, but achieved a ranking in the ninety-first percentile for the actual exam.On the other hand, the focus of the math questions made me think it would be easier than it actually was, and I was somewhat unprepared -- only seventy-fifth percentile for the actual exam!I'm donating mine to the library because the newest one they have is from 1997, but I'm writing inside the cover first -- telling everyone to go buy a different book!"
1,Not for you if you are targetting 700+,"This is a very...book and the questions are so easy and simple. It might be ok if you are in the 500-650 range, but if you want more, go for Kaplan and Princeton Review."
2,Not the perfect book,"The tests in this books are pathetic - I was not able to understand a lot of critical reasoning questioning, let alone answer them (fyi, my GRE anlytical score is 760/800). The introduction to the verbal section was somewhat useful, but the practice tests will really dampen your spirits."
2,"Sorry, but to this layperson, it's just not convincing","While I am by no means a biblical scholar, I have done my share of studying the origins of Christianity. I cannot speak to the linguistic side, where the author speaks of Greek language parallels. But I do think that I understand the basics of Christian origins, at least as far as what the various scholars have each emphasized.My opinion is that this book is not convincing. I have now read three-fourths of the book. The parallels seem tenuous at best. At times, the parallels seem coincidental. At other times, I simply don't see the parallels that the author sees.Remember, this is simply a layperson's opinion, but one whose keen interest in Christian origins is not satisfied by this theory."
3,Over valued!,At 29.99 this book is over valued for a paperback. By the middle of the book it became a rather boring read. I recommend buying it used if you have the option.
5,Fascinating book,"This book is a well-written account of a family central to American folk and country music in the 20th century. You don't have to be a fan of the Carters to appreciate their contributions to the music scene, but reading this book will surely make you want to hear more of their music. The author took the time to know family members and their home country and writes sympathetically of it. I expected to learn more about the Carters, I didn't expect to read a book as hard to put down as any mystery I've read. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the music, the region, and our shared history."
5,Excellent recounting of the Carters as People,"It is a difficult task to accumulate the information for a good biography. It is more difficult to write it in a way that makes the people in it come alive. I thought that the author accomplished both. Settings are well described - you know what kind of a world surrounded the Carters.There are many individuals in the story, and some of their designations changed with time. Sometimes I wasn't sure who the author was talking about. Part of that was probably my own shortcoming, but I would have liked a family tree, a diagram(with all of the nicknames for each individual). Ann Rowe Seaman provides such a chart in her biography on Jimmy Swaggart. Her chart includes Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley, both cousins of Swaggart."
2,Not so great,"This book covers an enormously important group in American music, and for that the authors deserve our thanks. It's a decent read and has plenty of fun and interesting information and anecdotes that people will no doubt enjoy. But as a serious (which is not to say scholarly) biography, it falls short. There are gaps in information, little real insightful analysis of what it is that makes the Carters' music so special, and some rather poor writing. Compare this to something like Nolan Porterfield's outstanding biography of Jimmie Rodgers, and the weaknesses in this book become startlingly apparent. Until a better study of the Carter Family comes along, there's no real alternative to recommend (there is Charles Wolfe's extensive liner notes to the Carter Family box set on Bear Family Records, but that's not easily accessible). If you're interested in the Carters, read this, but prepare to be underwhelmed--not by the story of the Carter Family, but by the way it's told here."
1,Buy the other one!,"This book is probably the worst of all of the Five Star Workout Books. It had (in my opinion) too much history of the Academy (not necessary for a Workout book) and it didn't cover anything I couldn't learn from the ""Navy SEAL Workout Book"" (also by Andrew Flach). Buy that one for the same price! It has far more information and Workout routines and exercises. The only good thing about this book was the 6-week Naval Academy P.E.P. (but I must admit it isn't that good either!). So buy the SEAL Book or just download the ""BUD/S Warning Order"" for free form any SEAL site and get a GREAT 15-week workout routine that is challenging!"
3,The Official United States Naval Academy Workout (Military Fitness) - a book,The Official United States Naval Academy workout (Military fitness) book is great for learning the proper way to do certain exercises.
2,Shame on me!,"You've heard the saying: ""Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me."" Shame on me, then, because after writing a lukewarm review for Boot Camp Workout, also by Five Star, I have the same to say about this one. While the workouts presented are credible, the book is very poorly done. Explanations of the exercises are imprecise, and the accompanying photographs sometimes contradict the text. Some exercises in the workout plan are not explained; for example, the workouts often call for you to perform a ""Dirty Dog"", yet nowhere in the book will you find an explanation of what a dirty dog is.The workouts are VERY intense. I'm 36 and in pretty good shape. But after 1 week of following this plan, I was too sore to move. If you are not already in excellent condition, then I can't even recommend this book for its workouts."
4,Practical magic!,"Arnold Mindell offers inspiring and though provoking examples of innovative techniques for communicating with those often thought to be past human interaction. He offers good theoretical and technical advice. As a health care provider, I found this book easy to read and very thought provoking. My family also had the opportunity to employ some of these ideas with one of our own family members, and it made a wonderful difference. This is a great resource for anyone interested in exploring new and creative realms of human communication and spiritual journeying when coping with life-threatening illness."
4,Good resource!,This book has concise overviews of the various compehendion strategies. It also gives text ideas to accompany the strategies.
3,mom,Book did not give alot of guidance as to specific tasks that can be done to assist your child in comprehending; however it did provide good insight on how my child does process the material that she reads.
4,THIS IS IN SPANISH.,This movie is in Spanish and I had to press the language button on the dvd player to get it to play in english. After I pop it out of the dvd player and play it again it is back in Spanish and I have to press the language button on the dvd player again.This film had been brightened up so you can see the settings better but the darkness on the VHS version of this filmed added to the eerieness.I always liked the music in this film. When a vampire attacks a women walking in a long hallway and the woman stabs the vampire it has this eerie singing like nuns in the cathedral on LSD singing latin (or maybe Spanish) but it has a medieval sound to it.This has been one of my favorite horror films. I thought it was made in the 1970s but it was made in 1980.
3,A little disappointed,"Considering what I had heard about this film, I found it to be a bit of a letdown. It's a decent horror film, but the whole look of the movie had a ""made for TV"" feel to it. I can't explain it. It's not cheap looking, it just had a flat look to it. To make an analogy, this film is to Molina's Werewolf movies what Scars of Dracula was to Hammer's Dracula films. A slightly better than average addition to a series of films that were starting to wear out their welcome."
4,Naschy gains a new fan,"Night of the Werewolf was written and directed by Naschy himself in 1980, after gothic horror had gone of style. Unlike Hammer's last movies of the 70's, however, this film is gorgeous. Naschy plays a tormented werewolf under the power of the vampiric Elizabeth Bathory. Certain plot elements, especially the opening scene where a man is executed wearing a mask, seem to be cribbed from Black Sunday."
3,"Good shelf, but price was high","I was a little annoyed when I first bought this shelf because the brown version cost ~$90, while the white version that my wife wanted cost ~$170. At the price of the brown version, this would be a five star rating. The shelf is solid, went together easily, and is exactly what I wanted it to be. However, for roughly two hundred bucks I would've expected it to be made out of real wood, not chipboard.I would highly recommend this shelf as long as you don't pay over $100 for it."
2,ladder bookself,Ladder Bookself very cheaply made should of had pilot holes glue that don't pop out of tub will not purchase again
1,Crichton's Worst,"Crichton has lost his touch.Although some of his recent novels (except Prey) have been boring, this one is the worst. Trying to prove that environmental lobbies are biased, probably not entirely correct, is still tolerable. Linking people who care about the environment to terrorism is carrying things too far.Crichton appears to have made his transition from a great author to a rabid anti-environment activist.I finished this book two days before the tsunami hit. The coincidence didn't help. I felt much worse about the message Crichton is spreading.A very avoidable book."
1,What Happened to Michael Crichton?,"I have been a major fan of Michael Crichton's since his first publication. His current book, ""State of Fear"", I am chagrined to say, is not up to his usual standards. What is he trying to say here? OK, so the earth's climate is naturally evolving and changing. But the basic points and the plot line of this book are not engaging, enlightening or uplifting. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I myself would think twice about reading another Crichton book. It seems to me that he has lost his touch."
4,"A good read, slightly off-target","This is a typical Crichton thriller in that it follows the Hollywood thriller formula without particular attention to plot plausibility, and imparts a bunch of information on interesting topics that Crichton has read more about than you probably have. The average person will learn something new about the hard science research on global warming (with footnotes).If you've liked previous Crichton books, you'll probably like this one, unless you are a believer in ""doing something about global warming."" Crichton lurches right on this issue, evidently nauseated at Hollywood ignorance and hypocrisy.The novel was disappointing in that it didn't address the current state of fear and the extent to which it might be the result of psyops by various parties.Crichton might consider ""peak oil"" as the subject for his next novel."
3,Educational,"The MarginState of Fear by Crichton was a disappointment in terms of story telling. This author stands alone when it comes to weaving a great yarn around science. His novels have kept me entertained and enlightened for years but this one falls short. If you are interested in learning more about global climate change and not just opinion based on anectodal evidence then I recommend it, however if you want an exciting well crafted thriller along the lines of The Andromeda Strain you might be disappointed too.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin, a novel about a modern day treasure discovery and the consequences that befall the discoverer."
5,ONE OF HIS BESTS,"I picked up this book after arriving in Kuwait on my way home to the States, and I couldn't put it down. This was one very exciting book which combines adventure, intrigue, and a look into the author's views of how politics and important issues tend to conflict. Although I do not agree with a lot of the author's views, I did enjoy the non-stop action the book entailed. So, in my opinion, it's a great book for those who like to think outside the box of the politically correct."
4,State of Fear,"I found the story to be less than exciting, but the facts about Global Warming are most interesting. He also talks about the nature of fear in our society and how the press puts so much focus on fear.I think it is worthwhile more to educate than to entertain.Jim Cookinham"
2,"um, wow",not that good. I think this would work MUCH better as a non-fiction that a fiction avtion-adventure story
2,Waste of time.,A very thin plot is used to express Crichton's ultra-conservative views on the environment. Too slow and too preachy. George Bush would love this one.
1,Crichton's State of Fear,"While I am a Crichton fan and have been for a long time, this particular story line is definitely not one of his best. But this audio version is simply not very well done. The male reader attempts to ""female"" versions of his voice as well as several different dialects and accents without success. It really detracts from the story itself. I found the female voices that he does to be very patronizing and inappropriate for the character. It was a prolonged agony to try to get through this particular book, but since I kept hoping it would get better - I stuck it out to the bitter end. What a waste of time."
3,on one hand...but on the other hand,"On one hand:I am a conservationalist and do believe in protecting the environment, but only to a degree. When I hear people say the debate is over about global warming, I believe it's because they aren't listening. Lately, the global warming, Al Gore types have taken a few hits. Considering MC wrote this book 5-6 years ago, he was ahead of the game. So, if you want some ammo against the global warming debate, this is a good reference source.On the other hand:If you only want to read this book for the fictional story, you could do better. The novel was good enough for me to finish it, but I found so much of the action to be over the top and not believable. By the way, I think the same about the show 24. There is no way so much can happen to the characters in such a short amount of time. I kept thinking...oh yeah, right, not believable.Currently, I am reading the following book and like it:Tsar: A Thriller (Alex Hawke)"
3,State of Fear,"My husband usually loves Michael Crichton, and so when we got this book on tape we thought it would be great. If you love the use of the ""f"" word than this book is for you. We just about went crazy with how often he swore in it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who would be listening to it in the presence of children!"
2,Boring sequence of science babble,I'm very dissapointed with Mr.Crichton. This book reads like one of the newer patriotic flag waving books that Tom Clancy has pestered us with lately. In fact the style was so similar I continually checked the cover to make sure it wasn't a Tom Clancy book.The story is very simple and boring. The fact bashing about Global Warming being a con is repetitive and very irritating. Characters are stereotyped and plain. I can't recommend this book at all. Unless you're a slobbering fan of the non existance of Global Warming.
1,Michael Crichton loses,"I have read and reread all of Michael Crightons books and eagerly awaited State of Fear. I read the first three chapters, closed the book and then donated it to the local library just in case someone out there wanted to read it.I have been disappointed in authors before but this one was the worst. Check it out at the library before spending money to buy it. Not worth the output."
2,LAME,"Lame! I have loved Crichton's books for a long time, but this one is just silly! Plot is silly, science is cherry-picked misinterpretation, and action is convoluted. I hope his next book is an improvement over this one."
3,Global Warming Is Only A Liberal Scheme?,"Michael Crichton doesn't think that human beings have ever influenced the earth's environment. Air pollution and the depleting ozone layer aren't causing global warming, so quit worrying. It's only a coincidence that we have been having so many hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis, because natural disasters only come in cycles. ""State of Fear"" is definitely worth reading, but it left me feeling like I had been lied to and I don't know who is telling the truth."
1,"A scince book disguised as a novel, instead of the other way","What a disappointment! This novel starts off with the promise of a fascinating read. It then becomes bogged down in scientific nonsense. It was a series of poorly strung together adventures, with pages and pages of mindless drone thrown in. I expected better from Crichton."
1,Zero stars (out of five!!!),The worst Crichton book ever. Not a plausible story by any stretch- and this is from someone who enjoyed the farfetched sci-fi of Jurassic Park!Don't waste your time or money!
1,Arrogant political trash posing as an unbiased novel,"Crichton writes in the book that everyone has and agenda except him. Please. If I could give this book a zero, I would just for that lie. He is pushing his obvious agenda on his readers. Funny, for a guy who has no agenda, he fails to mention any concerns at all about industrial pollution doing anything to the environment. Evidently it is only environmentalist and ecoterrorists who do damage to the environment. He even manages to toss in that silcone breast implants don't cause cancer, so keep sticking those fake boobs in girls. Crichton likes them. I used to like his novels, but this book reads like he is desperate to get back on top, so politically fanatic he couldn't control himself or vying for a lucrative paying job at Fox News."
1,Nonsensical Story,"I've enjoyed Mr. Crichton's books before as guilty pleasures. This one was not only badly written, but the plot was ridiculous.As an example, one of the main characters is not only a super spy and a brilliant scientist, but also just missed making the Olympic ski team. Although it isn't stated, I assume he's extremely attractive as well.Ridiculous."
1,An irresponsible piece of garbage,"I couldn't help but wonder, while I was reading this dribble, who paid Crichton off? To insist most emphatically that there is no such thing as global warming occurring during these times is just fooilsh. He either has some peculiar motivation for writing this book, or he has had his head buried in the sand. The tragedy is, thousands probably actually believe him. Try living through a few of the recent hurricanes if you don't believe me. And then check the data for hurricane predictions for the next seven years. That global warming is a fact is no fallacy."
2,Very disappointing,"I've been a fan of Michael Crichton for years, but this is a very disappointing read. The plot is overdone, the characters underdone, and the political statement of the book incredible (see the author's note stating that environmentalists, government and big business have EQUALLY bad track records at protecting the environment (page 573). Universities are also to blame, as these institutions are busy creating a state of fear about environmental or health dangers. Suffice it to say that this is the last Crichton book for me."
1,State of Flubber,"What a waste of money and trees. Crichton has always subtly (and not so subtly) distorted scientific fact to create his science fiction (with the emphasis on ""fiction"") novels, but in his latest he appears to have completely forgotten what little science he learned back in pre-med. What will he do for an encore, write a novel with the basic theme that gravity does not exist, the Earth is flat, and Republicans are honest? His point of view in ""State of Fear"" would be easier to understand if the novel were at all entertaining, but it reads like a rushed polemic, with cardboard characters and a contrived plot. Perhaps if it seemed like he understood climatology and meteorology even a small bit it would be more believable. At least he has set a benchmark for himself; this is definitely his worst book to date."
1,BORING!,"Nevermind the ""truth"" about global warming. Crichton quoted a bunch of studies that say what he thinks, and the other side can quote just as many for their point of view. The problem is that he could have subtly made his point while crafting a exciting thriller, but his sledgehammer-to-the-head method of getting his agenda across sucks all the fun out of the book. No sooner would I be gripped by an action sequence then he would go into a multipage diatribe about scientists with agendas (who are bad, as opposed to fiction writers with agendas, who are apparently good) and I'd lose interest and put the book down for days. It took me almost a month to slog my way through this one, when his books are usually a weekend rush for me. It was just DULL. As bad as the movie for Timeline was, I hope and pray no one tries to make a film version of this snoozefest. Unless you can get Ted Nugent to play Kenner, and then at least you'd get the right-wingers to go see it."
1,"If You Think Global Warming is Real, Don't Buy This Book.","If the dust jacket had told me this book was essentially a diatribe AGAINST the existence of global warming, I would never have bought it. As it was, I purchased the book-on-tape at a local book store for a six hour drive. After listening to half of the first CD, I threw it in the trash and chose to listen to the radio for the rest of the trip instead. Cannot believe this was written by the same author who wrote Jurassic Park and Andromeda Strain. I have lost all respect for Crichton."
5,Tech savvy author doesn't disappoint,"Crighton is one of those rare people who can describe highly technical things clearly enough for those who don't speak the language. I just read this book again, and had forgotten some of the global warming babble that is followed like a religion. This novel clearly presents the story, the evidence and the research. If you have an open mind, you may be surprised."
3,Not smooth...,This book's got its story all over the place! It switches setting like every chapter. I don't like this. Gets confusing and sometimes I don't get what's going on.
2,Would make a bad made for TV movie.,"The biggest lie in this book is in the author's message at the end where he states ""Everyone has an agenda. Except me."". In the guise of an action adventure story mixed with malevolent politicians (what a novel idea!), Crichton selects ""data"" to bash global warming and mixes it in with some of the worst dialog I've read. While I thoroughly enjoyed the Jurassic books, Rising Sun and Disclosure, this was a complete disappointment. In Disclosure, he turns the table on sexual harassment and makes it credible. In this book, turning environmentalists into evil, money grubbing terrorists is just silly. It's not even good enough for a bad made for TV movie."
2,What was Crichton thinking?,"I know, I know... I've just finished ""State of Fear"" in the abridged edition. My concerns and complaints are a result of bad editing, not inferior writing. If I want the whole picture, then I need to read the unabridged edition. Except... there is no way that poor editing can be used as the sole excuse for this book. The story line is thin, the characters totally unbelievable, and the science distorted (and worse, the distortion is one-sided). Whether you believe in global climate change or not, this conspiracy theory that Crichton dreamed up is over-blown, dogma-ridden, and painful to ""read."" I expected much, much better. Is he trying to get a date with Dr. Laura?"
3,Substance Over Style,"Ok so it's Crichton, so we can expect alot of facts to spew out of the fictional story, yet there is too much information in this novel.. or at least simply an overkill that seems to dilute the storyline. Several of the main characters were well developed, especially that of Sarah and Peter, yet some, as with Jennifer, were not. I was expecting more on what made Jennifer so stoic, calm and skilled at self defense. This was never explained, exept that she was kenner's neice. The professer that peter meets at the conference is a very interesting figure and I expected more from him as well. The ending was the greatest dissapointment for me..it just fizzled. Very anti-climactic indeed. So I had fun reading ""State of Fear"" yet this is certainly not one of his better efforts."
2,Using Story Telling to Teach,"I have enjoyed most of Crichton's books but not this one. I knew before the book that the Global warming belief was not based on good scientific data and that it is mostly a ""fad"" movement. Crichton's book added a lot of additional data that I had not seen before. I did enjoy reading that. But I wanted to be entertained by a fictional story. Instead, he would pour on the data then a little story, then data, more story, and so on. It was like a wierd form of propaganda with the story line squeezed in where he could squeeze it in. It was just too wierd for me."
3,state of fear,not mine belongs to ex so I can not comment but have to leave more comments because you have to leave a certain amount of words
5,Excellent book highly recommended.,"If you like this kind of novels, this book is for you.It contains dramatism, suspense etc. It's a very good book that only Crichton knows how to make it.Congratulations Michael you 're the ONE in this kinds of themes."
5,Crichton's last magnum opus,"Wonderfully researched book. The story itself is slight, but the whole worth while for the references and the epilogue is MUST reading.Should be required reading for Al Gore and the alarmist sensationalist media. There IS an alternative explanation for climate change. Carbon footprint might just be a political ploy and diversion.Read the book with an open mind. The softcover edition is excellent value and will be referred to frequently.Charles M Steed MD FRCP(C)"
4,Good Read,"Let me start by saying I enjoy all Crichton's books. With that said, State of Fear was little different then his usual. On the subject of the ""GLOBAL WARMING"", the book was written one sided. Now, I don't know if he did that to show his personal view or he felt the need to pick a side for the story. However, the story was well written and definitely makes you wonder about the stats we see everyday in the news. Granted it was not as exciting and fast pace like Congo, Sphere, or any of his other books, but it will definitely grab hold of you until you finish the book. Worth read!!! Hope this helped."
3,Politics aside...,"No matter what you think about the topics Crichton is addressing in this book, the plot of State of Fear is too bogged down with exposition; Crichton usually gets away with this because the underlying subject matter is always so exciting, but no dice here. Cloak and dagger, sure, but with this one I felt as if I were sitting in a lecture hall. An interesting lecture hall no doubt, but nowhere near his customary levels."
4,State Of Fear,An exciting and easy read but not his best book ever. It presented an entirely new angle on environmental issues. i
1,Preachy,"Crichton gets a bit preachy in this one. He's still a fine writter of course and there are some bright moments, but all the incorrect added maths make the story more than a bit awkward and dated. He would have been better off by sticking to the story. Instead, this novel seems to indicate the writer's urge to snigger in on an issue that he clearly fails to comprehend, at least beyond the immediate economic ramnifications benefiting the American upper classes ... particularly those with investments in fossil fuels. Taken as a whole, the book reads more like a petroleum company's manual for the indoctrination of executive management, rather than an interesting or exciting novel. This book provides little in the way of comparison to the drama of Jurassic Park or the intense experience of reading the Andromeda Strain. I must say that I'm disappointed."
1,reader for life,"This book is terrible. It is short on plot, character development and even on thrills. As one reviewer wrote of another very popular book, it is one improbable chase scene after another. The ""science"" overwhelms the story line to the point where it becomes a propaganda rant rather than a good novel. Whatever your views on the environmental movement or global warming it is still a ridiculous premise and poor writing."
3,Crichton finds a cause,"I love Crichton, don't get me wrong. I have and love all his books, but he's gone from telling a good story to preaching good ecoscience practices. This book almost reads like propaganda. I agree with Crichton's points completely, however I was looking for a thrilling read, not an educational experience. This is a decent story, but gets 3 stars because it's not as good as the standard Crichton set for himself with his previous books."
5,Michael Crichton's Response To Global Warming,"I know that looking to a novel to get a better understanding on ""Global Warming"" may, at first, sound odd. However, I haven't read many novels that had footnotes and had a complete appendix and bibliography to back it up. Micheal Crichton has done an excellent job of showing how the government and the media, in general, like to keep us in a ""State of Fear"".You pick the topic and after reading this book you will not watch the news again as you did before. I highly recommend this book."
4,Intriguing premise and a decent story,"I am a big fan of Michael Crichton, and this book did not disappoint. You'll find that reading this book will make you question a lot of what you read and hear about in the daily news. There is a TON of really interesting facts put together around a pretty good story.My only problem with the book is that the main character seems to take everything that is happening to him without much surprise. I think a normal person would have reacted with a little more emotion and confusion with everything he was learning and seeing. He was too robotic. This kept me from giving it a 5 star review.Otherwise, I definitely would recommend this book."
5,Grabs you & keeps you!,"Not a great reviewer here... all I can say is that this is the first MC book I've written & I LOVE it.Was totally engrossed in the first 10 pages.I disagree with some reviews who don't like what they call the ""anti-environmentalist"" aspect... I like seeing/reading the ""other side"".GREAT BOOK."
2,"A nice try, but, well...","In State of Fear, Michael Crichton thoroughly explodes the global warming mythology with his footnotes which, as he pointed out in the book's preface, aren't fiction. Unfortunately, besides being amoral and slovenly his characters are so wooden that no one really cares what happens to them, and most of the global warming evidence is smothered in the ennui the characters generate in the reader."
3,Who cares about the politics? It was kind of dull,"I am a huge Michael Crichton fan, but every now and then, one of his books just misfires with me. This is one of them. It was still worth the read -- thus the three stars. But, in truth, too many of the characters were two-dimensional and the action scenes were just redundant and not particularly thrilling. As for the political debate: Who care? It's a novel folks. Evil environmentalists are just as acceptable as evil corporate guys or killer presidents. And...in truth...I found a lot of the information provided in the book to be pretty interesting, although I am certainly not going to make up my mind based on it. So all in all...three stars."
3,a bit disappointed,"though the subject matter is interesting and one that deserves further inquiry, the novel itself leaves a lot to be desired. while it is, like all of crichton's other works, extremely well written and researched, it's a bit too preachy sometimes. the characters are polar opposites and at times the dialogue serves to merely diseminate what crichton has learned, making it unnatural and forced. also, the plot itself lacks much of the action and suspense that made his previous novels so fascinating. but while it isn't his best, it's still an interesting read. the main point is a good one, even if the way he presents it is a little far fetched."
2,Mixed entertainment value,"Usually when an author is truly passionate about a subject, they can relay that passion into their stories. And a power author such as Crichton, should have been able to convey that passion and make us feel something about the subject and/or the characters. Unfortunately, there are long lectures about global warming and the politicization of science amidst a story that could have been told in half the pages. The characters are cardboard, moving, but not feeling; acting but not thinking: perfect for a another special-effects movie that is sure to follow. The real plus? The bibliography!"
2,Slow start to no place,"While I have enjoyed many of Chriton's books (inspite of the fact that he does not know how to plausibly end a good story) this one holds little enjoyment. A ten page essay on the misunderstandings of global warning would have saved me the many hours it took to plow through this book. The story takes 250 pages to get going and constantly wanders through lectures on the ignorance of environmentalists. While the point may be valid in some ways the plot seems to be simply a guise to preach this point. There is no tension, no spark, no reason to care about any of the characters in the story or in fact in the world they are supposedly trying to save. The State of Fear is never developed. As a thriller it is empty and thrilless. As an environmental statement it is 550 pages to long. I won't give up on him for this book but it was a waste of $8.00 and 15 hours."
3,"Michael Crichton is Interesting, but Not Entertaining Today.","I've read several of Crichton's books. He is always a good, easy read. This one is backed up with facts, much like a Dan Brown novel. (Although I dispute most of them.) However, this book, despite being academic and somewhat interesting just isn't that entertaining. The ending is very weak. If you haven't read Prey, I suggest you start there. Or, Sphere. Or Congo."
1,An author's boring agenda,50 pages of spledid action wrapped in 550 pages of boring editorial. Great book to read if you are having trouble sleeeping !
1,Poor story. Poor attempt at a novel.,"To LA-Radio Ken, that is exactly the problem here. It is supposed to be a story. But it is such a horrible, boring, dull, undeveloped, poor ecxuse for a story everybody is trying to find something else to say about it. One start from me, and thats generous!"
3,Must read for other reasons,"While Micheal Crichton is not the most entertaining author out there (he's no Stephen King or Robin Cook in that regard), but he may well be the most intelligent writer active today. In State of Fear, he collects massive amount of environmental data and assembles it into a readable format. The information is well sited and compelling. At the very least, this book should be read as a counter-balance to the liberal media on environmentalism."
2,worst Crichton novel yet!!,"As a faithful fan since Andromeda Strain, my disappointment in this heavyhanded work is indescribable, but I'll try. Dr.Crichton has lost sight of what makes a great read; the story! By interjecting interminable, boring scientific details, he attempts to make a political point while trying to be entertaining--an unforgivable fault in fiction literature. Either be entertaining, or try to make a political point; you can't do both. Especially with a political point of view unsupported by most research, except the studies quoted here. To be boring and wrong is even worse! This book gets 2 stars from me only because the action at times overwhelms the pseudo-science, and because I'm sentimental; this is a FAR cry from Jurassic Park!!"
1,Why was this published as fiction?,This is not a novel but a rant about the global warming theory.The story is roughly 10% of this book while the rest is listening to his condescending opinions on the subject.I find it amazing that it was marketed as it was.
1,Ghastly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Arguably the worst book I have readt this year. If you are after and exciting and entertaining read, foget it. If you want a somewhat boring, very one-sided arguement, where Crichton attempts to convince you that pumping ton upon ton of poison into the environment with no deleterious consequences, then this is the book for you."
3,Fiction don't make it so.,"This book tries to be a book that debunks so many theories about global warming/climate change. However, it does it through the medium of FICTION. This book is not a social commentary in the way that 1984 was, but is as much of a social commentary as Jurassic Park. At the end, it is a good (if horribly misguided) piece of psychological fiction.The difference between this book and Jurassic Park is that the idea of global warming is much more of a plausible fact than re-engineering dinosaurs. However, readers beware: this book is as much a piece of fiction as Jurassic Park."
1,insulting,"When I pick up a Crichton novel I don't question that I will enjoy it. I have loved his books. However, this is the first time I have read one of his books and felt insulted. There isn't a character in the book who is sympathetic... or anyone that I care what happens to them. The main guy, Kenner, is arrogant, snobby and hateful. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, but it never does. The only way I can get through this is to ignore the politics and try and pretend it is just a mindless adventure novel instead of a right wing scree. Even if he is right about the science, which I admit is a possibility, the tone of this book makes me want him to be wrong... which is just silly. The whole book has a condescending attitude.. ""boy aren't my readers stupid"" There is no respect for his readers. We aren't stupid. There must be a better way to get his point across.....not enjoyablenot enlighteningjust not.which is too bad."
1,Preposterous,"I've been a Crichton fan for many years. The plots have always been out there but his characters and writing combined with the kernel of science made for a good read. A few years ago I struggled through Timeline and should have realized then that MC had jumped the shark. This latest book is full of it - cartoon characters, plot twists that confound belief and ham-fisted pedagogery regarding the scientific issues. The logical issues raised regarding environmental science were the only thing that got me through the drivel."
1,Whoa2,"James, I couldn't have said it better myself. And I am a ""green"".... and therefore take particular offence to losing forests to print this book on. What a waste of paper!"
2,You'll leave it unfinished,"One of the most tedious books ever. A long way from ""Congo"" Crichton lectures Hollywood types for whom hybrid cars are a fashion accessory.The entire book is like the first chapter of ""Timeline"""
3,Gee Dr. Feigenbaum....,"Can't get anyone else to talk about your book for you? Using the feedback arena for another author/bestseller to try to sell your own (completely unrelated and irrelevant) book? Talk about desperate measures....Pathetic!!This is not Crichton's best. It's not his worse, either."
2,One Sided Debate,"Although I generally enjoy Crithton's novels, I was disappointed with State of Fear. It had his usual fast moving thiller plot which I enjoy. However, this is offset with with a one sided debate on global warming theory. On one side are environmental proponents of the global warning theory. They are depicted as politically correct knee-jerk morons with no facts to back up their case. On the other side are the brilliant opponents of the notion of global warning. They have all the facts.This book presents in detail the case made by one opponent of the global warming theory. I expect the real proponents of this theory have an informed and detailed defense. We do not get to hear that defense in this book. I do not profess to know which side is right in this debate, but I expect that the ""correct"" answer to the debate question falls somewhere in the middle."
5,Crichton Touches a Nerve,"The extreme variation in ratings for this book are a vivid demonstration of Crichton's premise: bias is driving much of the research of so-called ""global warming"" (or should I say ""abrupt climate change""?). It's apparent that many of reviewers have drunk deeply of the global warming koolaid - and it's their bias that's showing, not Crichton's. For my part, it's a great book with a powerful message for ALL Americans."
1,"Boring, Boring Boring!!!",This book is nothing but a thinly disguised polemic. It consists of long-winded discussions of environmental issues in which one side is calmly brilliant and the other is stupid and without merit. In between are some unrelated action scenes. There is little suspense and the characters are without merit. Pass this one by and read jurasic park instead.
4,State of Fear,Very interesting take on Global Warming. Twists and turn around every unsuspecting corner. The only downside? Global Warming is portrayed as a hoax.
2,Michael Crichton's soapbox,"Clearly Michael Crichton has alot to say about global warming, the prostitution of the scientific community, and sinister environmental groups that have sold out in the name of greed, and that's OK. I just wish he were brave enough to do so in a work of nonfiction instead of hiding behind this genre. This book is Michael Crichton's Tom-Cruise-""I-know-all-about-Psychiatry"", moment and he's not looking to be challenged or disputed.I won't argue the science or the validity of his commentary on the corruption within the environmental movement. I don't doubt that most of it is true. But for Crichton to include an ""Authors Message"" at the end of his book where he states that ""everybody has an agenda...except me"" it the most absurd thing I've ever read in a work of fiction. So selling books is not an agenda?Too bad ""State of Fear"" is so smug. There is a good message here, if you can just get past how irritating it is."
2,"This is a novel, people!","This book may be a fun read, but it has very little accuracy when it comes to climate change. Nearly all the crises that occur are completely far fetched. Its implication that there is a conspiracy among scientists is also crazy. (Can 3000 scientists keep a conspiracy a secret??) Crichton is a novelist, and a good one, but not an authority on climate change. If you want to know the facts about climate change research, don't look here."
2,"No offense, but the language was too harsh to handle","No offense to you, Mr. Crichton, but I never finished the book because the language was - to be direct - offensive to me.I realize that some stories need to use words I find unacceptable for my everyday usage or for that of those around me. I found it difficult to get past, however, because what I read becomes part of me.For those who don't mind such things, it might be a great book. I'm sorry I never got to find out.-- RuthAnn"
4,A good page-turner,"While the scientific material in this book is hotly debated, the book itself is still a fantastic page-turner. It filled up a long flight for me and made it pass by quickly. Sometimes (and usually with writers like Michael Crichton) that's all I want from a book ;)More at [...]"
1,The cause for the shallow rich!,Out of all the millions of dollars this author has made writing books and the amount that he has given the poor or in general to help the present masses is nothing. There are so many causes that affect the poor here in the U.S. that who cares about globel warming and the effect our second or third generation even if they are right. This is a plight of the rich and educated shallow masses that believe not in my back yard. The author should be ashamed of himself thinking that he is making a difference. Mr. Crichton why don't you write about health care or the struggle of getting a good education without money or thinks that affect the struggle of every day life. When will you wake up!!!!!!!!
3,"Good science, bad fiction","Crichton continues his recent trend in writing: the science he covers becomes more and more fascinating, but his fiction becomes more and more banal. The book is worth reading because of Crichton's interesting scientific observations, but the plot is episodic, voyeuristic, and generally uninteresting."
5,State of Fear,"Interesting and well written. This book takes a different look at the man made global warming topic. True believers will consider this tome to be the 'satanic verses' of their cause. The bibliography is extensive in citing sources and scientific studies for the material from scientist who did not get the memo that the debate has been offically declared over by its inventor. These alone could be used a reference source for anyone debating the certantity of this topic. The story itself is not that beliveable but a good read. This book is more along the line of Rand's ""Atlas shrugged"" in that it advances an ideology (or disputes one) through itself."
3,Not Crichton's best...,"This book abounds with interesting facts and Mr. Crichton has, once again, done his research. However, the book is nothing special and although a enthralling book that moves along nicely, it is by far a sub-par thriller by an extraordinarily talented writer."
4,Enjoyable as are all Crichton Books...,"This book falls in line with most of Crichton's recent books- hot topics for current culture. While it wasn't break neck exciting for the entire book, and of course the usual unbelievability of certain character situations, he still managed to craft a book that would hold interest throughout. I always look forward to his releases, and he doesn't seem to force himself to write a book each year like other commercial authors, so as to just make out with a payday. Enjoyable and worthwhile."
1,Cranky rather than Critical.,"Dr. Crichton has set his sights on environmentalists who irritate him (the character of the thinly disguised actor Ed Begeley Jr. meets a most horrible end.)If environmentalists drive you nuts, too - this is a book for you.A threadbare plot with many tirades, use of selective material to prove his point and alas only cardboard cut-out characters will not be of much interest to those who appreciate his better efforts.Save your money - you can read his ""Remarks to the Commonwealth Club by Michael Crichton San Francisco September 15, 2003 and get the same thrill.Michael Crichton: The challenge of distinguishing reality from fantasy, truth from propaganda--environmentalism"" at http://www.forces.org/articles/files/crichton.html"
2,Disputable,"True to form, Crichton writes yet another fast-paced, enjoyable fiction. However, this work promotes a perspective that is highly questionable. Don't ask me, ask the scientists he references (eg., http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/hansen_re-crichton.pdf) as well as others (http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=74). While Crichton deplores the level of certainty in the world today, he often seems to be far too certain himself. But, on the other hand, how certain can he be if he cherry-picks scientific data and publications to support his basic premise?I expect greater rigor and honesty from those with such powerful pulpits."
1,WHAT A BORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I gotta side with the one-star faction here. I ignored the environmentalist-bashing in this book, and tried to read it as a story. What a bore. I cannot recommend this book at all."
1,Huge disappointment!,"I would have paid twice what the price was to read a book by the author of Jurrasic Park and Timeline, but I'm glad I didn't. The characters were shallow, all of them, and the sub-plots underdeveloped and mixed in without much forethought. I felt like I was being preached to the entire time- the graphs were totally unnecessary and excessive. Mr. Crichton should have just written a non-fiction book about his views on global warming and spared his reputation."
3,Global warming presented as overblown hype.,"Michael Crichton's talent is to entertain us with fantastic ideas and not great literature. I was hooked by his premise that global-warming has yet to be substantiated to the degree necessary to justify the media hype. If Crichton's opinion is just that, then its good to hear a dissenting opinion and I honor the author's willingness to take some heat for such a contrarian view. However, if this premise was thrown in for shock value....Even so, if you read this book, you will pause at every report on television or in print concerning global-warming, and wonder if it's really possible that Crichton is right and everyone else wrong. It is thought provoking ideas like this that make it possible for us to suffer through yet another badly written Crichton novel."
3,Typical Chricton,"This is an excellent page turner. It will hold your attention. There is one scene at the end of the book that is so horrible however, that it ruined a lot of the fun of the book for me. I just can`t get it out of my head."
2,Disappointing,"Crichton uses this book to convey the reader his ideas on environmental policies and argues that the public is in a ""state of fear"" that makes them believe whatever the policymakers want them to believe. He tries to make it look like the book is on a general ""state of fear"" - not just linked to environmental policies but political and social policies in general. However, it is very clear that he simply wants to express his disbelieve of global warming and other environmental issues. He conveniently uses scientific data that supports his views and neglects to mention publications which would counter them.Don't waste your money and your time. This book is not worth reading."
1,Bad Science and Bad Writing,"Are we still having this worn-out debate after all these years? My God, even when strong-armed by the Bush administration, his own science advisors had to tell him the truth that global warming is a fact. Thank goodness, the National Academy of Science could not be embarrassed into providing what the president wanted to hear!Let's get on with the solutions.Regarding the writing, I have somewhat enjoyed other Crichton novels, but the characters are so flat here one could cut them out with scissors. The ""dumb"" environmentalists are laughable as succumbing to ""fear."" I listened to the audiobook version, and the narrator made both scientists and their benefactors sound like buffoons. For a while, I thought that Mike Myers would show up to at least offer the reader some comic reliefIf you want to look at a state of fear, just look last 7 years of the Bush Administration and that's not fiction."
2,State of Boredom,"Crichton is a phenomenal author, but this latest effort is a snore. State of Fear is a complete disappointment."
5,Conventional wisdom out the window!!,This book defenetly throws conventional wisdom out the window! It will anger a lot of people and make others really think hard about something most of us have just accepted as real.
1,What a load of rubbish,Enough words have been wasted on this junk. I'll let my single star say it all.
2,New study destroys Crichton theory,"Crichton bases his global warming is a hoax theory on Antarctica cooling and glacier growth. The new Jan 2009 NOAA study in Journal 'Nature' shows that Antactica is warming like the rest of the earth. And the big Wilkins Ice Shelf is about to head seaward.State of Fear is really a non-fiction report which attempts to prove that global warming theories are nonsense. Sprinkled over the charts, graphs, and footnotes is a bit of fiction in which evil environmental activists are portrayed as going to any length to create fear of global warming. In the book, Crichton has scheming environmentalists lure families to riverside parks, douse the rivers upstream with artifically enhanced storms, and then film the hapless children as they are swept away. The evil environmentalists then provide the films to the media to scare the public about the horrors of the impending warmup.Overall this is silly scientific nonsense."
1,Worst book ever from Crichton,"This is undoubtedly the worst book by Michael Crichton so far. So, it is unfortunate that it is also his fattest book so far?I must confess Crichton lost my sympathy completely, when I noticed that he was trying to preach that most environmentalists fake their data to support their argument. Other than the incumbent US president, I doubt whether this point of view has any buyers.May be the data with which environmentalists are soothsaying doomsday are not conclusive. But then, Crichton and his protogonists have equally inconclusive data to prove other wise.Do not waste your time reading this book, unless you are a SUV user who needs some therapy to overcome the guilt of burning so much gas every time you get your donut."
2,Not all that great,"OK-so maybe I'm the only one who didn't like the book. I felt the characters were one-dimensional, not to mention basically unbelievable. The woman (Jennifer and Sarah) are lovely and athletic. Both are ready to tackle any object placed in their path. The attorney, Peter Evans, is occasionally too simple minded to be believed. He does manage to evolve from a total crybaby to a partial crybaby. Kenner is perfectThroughout the book, I had the feeling I was being talked down to. The language was simplistic. The book appeared to be a place for Chrichton to vent his personal frustration about the current state of the environment.I adored most of Crichton's books. I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone over the age of 14."
5,Excellent blend of fact and fiction,"This is an excellent book by an excellent author. An exciting story blended with one of today's most talked about topics (global warmning) makes for great reading. The fact that the author questions some ""common knowledge"" regarding global warming makes the book all the more interesting."
2,"Preachy ""Thriller""","The story starts off strong with suspense and intrigue about the ecological movement. However the overlong book becomes silly and preachy with a less than subtle anti-global warming agenda, with cardboard characters and predictable outcomes. The last 300 pages are painfully boring as the lead characters avert near death over and over again in ridiculous, unbelievable situations (no one would be that stupid to keep coming back for more!). I ended up feeling cheated of the time I spent reading when I was done. I used to be a Chricton fan, but this may have been my last book of his."
1,Garbage,"I can think of nothing good to say, so I will keep this short. I've often, but not always, enjoyed the novels of Michael Crichton. State of Fear turns out to be one of those novels I disliked. I'm no tree-hugger, but even I can see Crichton is trying to push an agenda here. He's no better than the tree-huggers in his selective cherry-picking of facts. Skip this book. If you're a Crichton lover, wait for the paperback."
3,Loaded with facts?,"State of Fear is a good read, except that there is too much of detail in the book along with difficult (for the ordinary reader) to read charts. Obviously Crichton would like us to believe and, I am sure he has, done his homework well. There is a lot of research that has gone into the book.However, the character of Evans is wishy-washy and as he is ostensibly the hero of the book, his character should have been well delineated.As far as the environmental concerns go, how much of it is true and how much of it is one-sided it is difficult to know. Whether or not there is global warming and if there are actually environmental terrorists are scenarios which are possible if not probable.Incidentally Evans take of global warming and other evironmental issues are the same or a normal person, so perhaps it is more of the media brainwash than anything else!At least Crichton comes up with new theories which make his books a good read as well as make you think afresh."
3,Good Read - But Not the Best,"Disappointing read. I don't know what to make of it.Hint, skip the first 100 pages. I thought this section was a bit dull, as it consisted of legal questioning and various types of data skewing.A bit contradictive. On one hand, Crichton supports his firm belief in science to redeem the human race, on the other hand, various research/theories are effectively discredited through the book. He exposes skewed data, poor research procedures, corrupt politicans & big business. My point, science is unreliable because humans are unreliable. So why trust in science, you're just trusting in bungling humans. Contrary to Crichton, I think Politics, Religion, and Science can co-exist if a person has a fair understanding of each of these.Eh, I should have grabbed the new Koontz book."
2,unexpectedly boring,"Having read Crichton's other books e.g. ""Prey"", I started this book with great anticipation.But only the first few chapters were capturing, then it starts to get quiet boring. The plot is sort of unclear and less than convincing,for almost 600 pages. It just goes on and on and on mixed with too much information on climate change covering up for a poor story, until it comes to an aprupt and unconvincing end."
2,not so good,"This book was a suprise to me. Most of the time i like micheal crichton novels. This one bored me with too much time spent talking to lawers and environmentalists. There was not enough action and suspense. Some parts were thrilling and technical, and thats why i give this book 2 stars. Read sphere or prey instead."
2,2.5 stars,"It was one of those typical Chricton books you can't put down... but it turned out to be so darn preachy. He had me, he really had me with the whole environmental conspiracy theory. He had me in that you have to question common beliefs and the main stream media. But the book tried so hard to preach these ideas that it got annoying and he LOST ME. And Michael Chricton really has a mean streak. I loved Timeline but I thought the ending with the black plague was a bit harsh... this one was even worse! Cannibals no less consuming a very unlikeable character! It was a bit too much even for me, one who likes conspiracies and high body counts in books! I hope I never get on Chrictons bad side."
3,Felt like I was being preached to,"While I agree with most of what the author says in this novel I felt like I was being preached to rather than reading a fiction book. The ""story"" part of this book was quite thin. Most of it was discussion about global warming. I have to admit I did like the fact that the villain was not a ""evil"" corporation. It was a nice change of pace."
1,Funded by GOP and the Polluting Industry,"This is a very strange book, it is NOT a Novel. Usually a novel is a story, right? Well, this is a long, long discussion about Global Warming, trying to make the point that all NGOs are bandits, everyone who is in favor of the Kyoto protocol is stupid, Global Warming is good for you and me and the world and The Third World. The characters are shallow, no emotion at all, they are in the book just to provide some resemblance of ""novel"". This is a book that could have been ordered by the GOP and the big polluting industries, oil, gas, etc. Don't waste your money in the book, it will just try to brainwash you to be in favor of pollution, destruction of the environment, and to convince you that environmentalists are crazy, or corrupt, or stupid."
1,"pseudo-scientific thriller, useable as propaganda","I was a little upset by the underlying thesis of the book which paints environmentalists as the bad guys, but when I saw on the news how a conservative house-or senate member was waving this book in the air as a ""proof"" that global warming is a phantasy, I came to the conclusion that the author is,consciously or unconsciously, contributing to the anti-environmental campaign of the Bush administration. You can say as often as you like that his books are only science-FICTION, but somehow, to the wider public, anything that MC writes, has the ring of truth. This effect should serve as a warning to the writers of science fiction."
3,Crichton's clever mind : State of Fear,"What's good: Thought provoking, fast action ( read: page turner), likeable characters, persuasive rejection of global warming mantraWhat's not: major characters co-opted by unfleshed, unreal protagonist, plots and minor characters left dangling, clever situations are poorly resolved, preachy.If Michael Crichton's only previous effort had been Jurrasic Park it would be enough to demand the reading of all of his future novels. It is his genius to see a unique way of contesting popularly held views.This is not his best novel because of the short commings mentioned in ""what's not""There is no doubt that Crichton posses a laudable intelect. Surely this novel would have been improved by another 200 pages of plot and character delineation.Will I read his next offering? AbsolutelyCaslo Cranston"
3,alittle disappointing,"I love Michael Crichton...but this one slipped by him alittle. Not up to his usual lofty standards. That said, compared to most writers, still excellent. Worth a look or two."
5,A taste of their own medicine?,"Media is used to manipulate public opinion to associate global warming with human activity, and Crichton uses his own media fame to manipulate it back towards skepticism. The irony abounds.What this book really seems to be is a Rorschach test. The folks who review it poorly do so because it challenges their views and comes off preachy. The folks who review it highly do so because it affirms their views and validates their beliefs (or lack thereof).Personally, I tend towards skepticism, and find myself favoring Crichton's treatment. But that being said, if you're a dyed in the wool believer, you might not want to subject yourself to this kind of intellectual challenge."
1,I think that we could all make a million $..................,"if this is all you have to do. I mean come on I am sure he had met a laywer in his life, NEVER one like the guy in the book. And why would the ""agents"" try to stop a huge disaster with the whimpy lawyer, a secretary. It is terrible. Library if you must....but I just hate to buy this kind cuz it only encourages terrible writing. Try something else......Ralph Peters, Robert Heinlen, Trevian...."
1,Skip this one altogether,"I agree with almost everything that A. Brophy has written. It was a good page turner (skipped through most of the text because it was so boring), thus, it is also a fast read. It is also completely unbelievable. The only place a disagree is with his recommendation. This is possibly the worst book I have read this year!G."
2,This is not typical Crichton,"I thought I was studying for a test. If your looking for that typical Michael Crichton adventure, skip this one. It bored me to near death. I bought the book. To bad for me. Next book by M.C. I'll get it at the library."
1,Not even wrong (an embarassment for the author),"Crichton is one of the all-time great writers of thriller-fiction. Most of his books have deservedly been bestsellers with numerous film adaptions.Unfortunately, this is one of Crichton's worst books. In State of Fear, his knee-jerk antipathy to the environmentalist movement has blindsided him re: global warming. Despite claiming to have spent years researching the topic, Crichton's book is sadly misinformed re: the facts, esp. considering that it was just published in 2005.In a time when glaciers are undeniably melting and it's 60F in NYS (in late December), it's obvious to any idiot that global warming is real. This book is an embarassment for an otherwise great author."
1,"Lame, Pedantic","Lame! I have loved Crichton's books for a long time, but this one is just silly! Plot is silly, science is cherry-picked misinterpretation, and action is convoluted. I hope his next book is an improvement over this one."
1,Save your money,"If you're looking for a typical creative, exciting Micheal Crichton novel, this is not it. He seems to use this non-fiction as a vehicle to tell us that the green house effect is a bunch of hogwash. The story is very predicable and the characters spend way too much time arguing about whether the ozone depletion is real or not. I'm not an environmentalist, I just think that he over does it to make his point. If you want a really good thriller read Brimstone by Preston and Child - it rivals The Di Vinci Code"
5,"Whenever the media is pressing an issue, you have to know that big business is behind it.","The more the media and government talks about global warming, the more convinced I am there is nothing to it. I read State of Fear just after it came out and was impressed with the amount of independent scientific research Crichton used as a basis for the book.Big business has every reason to push a global warming agenda on us. Look at the price of corn in the last few weeks. Everyone is rushing to buy into the ethanol boom but hardly anyone knows that it takes a gallon of petrol to make a gallon of ethanol. Does it make any sense to buy into it?If you would like to learn something factual about global warming, like it doesn't exist, you should read this book."
3,Is that all there is??,"Michael Crichton writes great stories and State of Fear is definitely one of them. He takes a perhaps unpopular pesrpective on global warming but joins others in his distaste for the culture of fear served up by the world news megalopoly. In many of his stories, character development pays a price for the focus that he places on getting his larger message across. State of Fear is no exception in this regard but is a worthwhile read."
3,State of Confusion,"I love Michael Crichton novels.When I first got Jurassic Park, I stayed up all night reading it. It was mind-blowing. I feel bad for anyone who only knows the story from the crappy Spielberg movie. Sphere was terrifying and disturbing. Timeline opened up quantum theory in a new way (again, the movie sucked).State of Fear -- his latest novel -- hit stores on Tuesday. I trekked over to Costco on my lunch break to pick up a copy. I spent most of this weekend reading it, hoping that each page would get better.It didn'tThere's too many characters, too many locations, too many stupid motives, too many dumb cliches. Seriously, eco-terrorists are carrying around tiny octopi in Zip-Lock baggies to be used a poisonous weapons? A lawyer and a personal assistant saving the world and repeatedly cheating death?The really sad part is... it'll probably be another two years before we get another chance at a good Crichton novel."
2,Too preachy,"This is my first Michael Crichton novel, and likely my last. I have an interest in climate change so I found it interesting for the most part, but if you didn't have this interest I think you wouldn't like the book. Lots of stats and quite preachy. I like a good story and this had it, but it was buried in the preachiness."
3,Below Crichton Standars,"This book has raised the most controversy of all his work. In my opinion he misleads the reader on Global Warming, he defenitely mislead me, only after further study I came up with different facts on the subject. I love his writing and the story is ok, you have to understand that some of his books start by confusing the reader on what is real and actual and what is fiction, is his style. But I do recommend reading further information about global warming before making any judment about the subject."
2,"Long, boring, no dramatic finale","This book started out interestingly enough, so I thought I was in for a good ride. The characters are pretty well formed, and I actually like learning about all this global warming stuff. However, after a couple chapters the book started to bog down for me. It's waaaay too long, and the ending was ultimately a let down. All that build up should have come to a more exciting end. I'm very disappointed."
3,Crichton's Attempt at Ayn Rand??,"Is it just me or does this piece of work seem like a desperate attempt at achieving significance and leaving some type of Atlas Shrugged type legacy?? Crichton says all his work is neutral ""research,"" but the slant he has attempted to put forth is obvious. While I will admit that he makes his case to a certain extent, the story he puts forth to do it is terrible. Save your sales pitch on anti-environmentalism for the next Republican convention Crichton."
2,"Convoluted, Inane and a waste of time","I've read and enjoyed most of Crichton's work, but ""State of Fear"" is an exception. I don't expect everything in a thriller to make sense for narrative purposes, but the author seems to have written this one on autopilot. Chapters run no more than 5 pages each and there is little coherency from one part of the book to the next. I won't give away the plot, but it pales next to Jurassic Park, Congo, Airframe, Prey and even Sphere. I would not be surprised if MC wrote this one in a month."
5,A must read for those concerned about environmental issues,"I enjoyed the story, but ""State of Fear"" is really more a Greek dialog discussing the various views on global warming. Drama and action are spread liberally through the book, but ultimately it's all about the conversations between those who have a clue about science and those who just want to feel good about doing something - however misguided."
2,State of Fiction,"There is no question Michael Chricton can write, but much like his earlier diatribe against Japan, this book contains Chrichton's biases and opinions which are in many cases are preachy and way off base. And I'd like to see Chrichton defend his theories that the earth is not warming in BC, Canada, where there hasn't been a significantly cold winter for years and pine beetles are decimating the forests because of it. But as a work of fiction, it is okay--a little more work developing the personalities and relationships would have been more fun."
2,"I really, really wanted to love this book","Ever since my fiance made me read Al Gore's ""Earth in the Balance"", I've been sceptical of the science behind global warming. ""State of Fear"" does a remarkable job in illuminating the political agendas of those who manipulate scientific data for their own purposes.What the novel does NOT do, however, is entertain. The characters are one dimensional and dull, the dialogue tedious and the story line so linear and predictable that it's as if Mr. Crichton concocted it solely for the purpose of making the larger point about Global Warming.Mr. Crichton is a real novelist and I view this as a lapse of good judgment on his part in the service of a larger cause. It reminds one of what politically motivated Soviet era and Nazi era ""art"" must have been like."
2,Silly and not believable,I bought this book when it was first published and only now got around to reading it. I thought it would be good airplane reading. Although aspects of the plot were interesting it did not make any sense that the fate of the world would be left at the hands of a mysterious scientist/soldier/spy accompanied by an attorney or two and someone else's executive assistant. And about those cannibals...really? really?
5,A fun Read,"I found this to be a really fun book to read. I commend the author for the list of references at the end, so that readers are free to research on their own and form educated opinions.The plot was fast-paced, the characters had intelligent dialogs, and the bad guys were perfectly devious. He may have taken an unpopular stand with the storyline, but that seemed to work well for Dan Brown. I think Crichton did his homework, took a risk, and pulled it off well."
4,Politically Incorrect & Worth Reading,"Fast paced, preachy, politically incorrect, in your face, and everybody who's curious about the Global Warming hype should read this book. Even if it's not 5-star material, it's good enough to make any reader think about the B.S. that the media is trying to shove down our throats. As Crichton points out, anytime you mix science with politics, the public is never going to get honest information. The people who write reviews of this book and only give it one star, is because they're blind believers in the fake science of Global Warming. The whole concept of Global Warming is only an unproved theory, and this book does a great job at looking at the other side."
3,"Good story, poor execution.","It seems to me that Crichton was too much in a rush to publish this book. While the story is exciting, the characters remain flat and at times seem totally fabricated (Prof. Hoffman; Bradley) to force in additional perspectives on the global warming issue."
3,The Anti-Coriolis Effect: Circling the Drain,"I like Michael's writing, but his misuse of clear scientific knowledge here is grossly out of touch. Ultimately he decides after reading reams of material that because we don't know everything we know nothing. This is a shame. As a scientist myself, a biologist, I just can't sign on to the screed on endangered species that is a classic argument from ignorance: since we don't know how many we have, we can't know how many we've lost. The characters are funny and well-developed but the idea that radical environmental groups have to engineer disasters is unfounded. We have them and they are real. Anthropogenic-caused global warming is well-documented and the numbers misused by Crichton are much more accurate than a reader will know from this effort. Unfortunately he has the ear of the president. As Dr. James Hansen of NASA, who was defamed in this book said, ""Houston we have a problem."" And it doesn't come from GreenPeace."
2,State of Boredom,"Ever have a chat with your spouse or boyfriend/girlfriend where your partner keeps saying the same thing over and over and you just want them to stop because you keep zoning out? That's what reading this book was like.Over and over Crichton tells us that Global Warming isn't really happening. He presents information (including footnotes and charts) that support that hypothesis again and again and again. And again, in case the reader missed it the first fifteen times it was presented.This book reads like a doctoral student's last-chance thesis, except that there are a few totally uninteresting characters put in to present information in the form of fictional dialogue in case the reader gets bored looking at charts and reading footnotes.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
4,Global Warming Man Made?,"The author gives many well researched references that lead to facts that are contrary to a theory of universal global warming.He also provides references that suggest that mans activity has little to do with it, especially when considering the climate history of the earth.All this on top of a very exciting story in the novel."
3,Another disaster book,"This book has two faults. One is the lack of charactertization. When I was reading the last few pages, I still had to stop and think, Which is Jennifer and which is Sarah? The other is that it is heavy on feather-dusting: Evans has to have every detail explained to him with footnotes. It is a way of telling what is happening, but it gets old to read through the lectures. And, oh, yes, one other: nobody seems to rest. No naps. They dart off around the world on a moment's notice and do impossible things. The book comes off as a cartoon. I stayed with it because of the environment angle, but I don't think I will want any more books by Crichton for a while."
3,Really? Who could go through that much alive?,"Reading a book is all about suspending belief, but c'mon. The things that these characters go through in just a few days is a bit ridiculous, especially for a book that says it's fact-based-fiction. Plus, the story ended without a conclusion. Everything suddenly is okay with the world, and there's no more danger (or fear, if you will).A fast read, although a lengthy one. The point/counterpoint approach to the book was interesting, it makes you laugh at people in your life that tout the environment while ruining it in their own way."
3,My eyes got jet lag,"Three great action sequences. 623 pages to tell us ""global warming is a natural phase"". Many tiresome pages of characters running back and forth. Many pages of lectures."
3,Middle of the road.,"Like most of the author's most recent work this book is not exactly good and its not exactly bad it suffers from the same problems that dogged ""Prey""Crappy characters that was so unlikable that you don't care if they live or dieA vast threat that looms on the edge of the narration for the entire book and when it finally arrives your reaction can be summed up in two words ""That's it?""Overall-While parts of the book work fine as a social criticism the central theme being that we don't yet know enough about climate change to make an informed decision this book is not without merit. As a medium designed to tell a story and entertain people this book falls flat. Success has been good for Michael Crichton I wish I could say the same for his readers."
3,Crichton has better books,"I've read a lot of his books, and this one was pretty average. Not bad, but he's got many that are much better."
2,A disappointed fan,"For years, I have been an avid reader of Michael Crichton's books. I always enjoyed the way that he interweaves various scientific and technological facts into a thrilling fictional work. However, this book has been a great disappointment. All of the subtlety of previous works is gone. He seems to take a very clearly biased, one-sided stance against Global Warming - a controversial issue with valid scientific arguments on both sides - presenting us with shallow, cardboard characters that are either fools or scoundrels. For the first time, I found myself actually bored. I hope that, in future novels, he will return to his old approach."
1,an insult to literature,"The author dosen't quite know if he wants to write a novel or an article for a journal. What comes across is forced dialogue, empty characters and a plot that is loosly held together so he can express his views on global warming. It dosen't work! After I read a book, I usually share it with family and friends. This book went directly in the recycleable bin with a sticky pad that read ""garbage""."
1,"Bad Science, Bad Fiction","Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him."
1,Denial....,"All I can say after reading this book is - complete denial.So... the author thinks that pumping 6 billon tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year, does absolutly nothing!The author is right, in effect, we should just go on buring fossil fuels (a finite resource that we use to make tons of useful items) and pretend everything happening around us is an illusion.The author should stick to writing fiction."
1,absolute FICTION,"When a writer of science or social fictionstarts ignoring NASA scientists, accredited climatologists,and even the bush administrations' own scientists, it is time forme to realise what a wonderful writer of FICTION dr.mike is.I just wonder who he wrote this for? Bored oil company executives?The lunatic fringe of the right wing? Too bad he didn't put in footnotes that do not actually go anywhere, much like all of annecoulters fiction does. It is pathetic to see an author whose work was once respected start using his fiction as right-wing political screed.Oh well, you know what they say ""money talks, bull......"""
2,Not very interesting,"I won't bother with the premise of the book as its already been done.I don't really like or hate Crichton. However, this book is extremely boring and long winded. Also, although the author does attempt to explain the scientific stuff, it bored me.This is supposed to be a thriller, but it really missed its mark."
1,Great disappointment,"For the first 450 pages you are not involved in a novel, but the author's views, not well disguised, on global warming. Graphs, statistics, and scientific presentation do no mix well in a novel format. Great disappointment. Not worth the time."
1,Don't waste your pleasure reading time,"I feel like I've been mugged; Crichton stole my scarce plesure reading- time on this one. For anyone thinking of reading this book I recommend that you peak at the Author's notes at the end of the book first and then decide if you want to endure 600 pages of an absurd story line so that Crichton can develop a fictional platform to launch his political views.In a word, this book is contrived."
2,Not the usual Crichton novel,"I usually can't put a book by Crichton down once I start. This was not the case with this book. It was too long, and became boring at times. It could have used a lot more editing."
2,Cheap Anti Global-Warming Diatribe,"There was plenty of material here to make a decent thriller worthy of reading. Would even have been fine to make environmental terrorists the bad guys.Crichton, however, spent endless pages blasting the reader with his personal anti global-warming message. On and on and on it goes. I saw Mitchner and Heinlein go bad. I hope Crichton comes around and returns to simply writing good thrillers."
3,Not Subtle About Message,"Michael Crichton has always tried to add a message or two in the books he writes, and typically they are good ones. The difference between the way he delivers the message in those books and in this one is that in his other books the plot always takes precedence, and personal opinions by the author are only thrown in if they don't deter or distract from the theme. This book promotes the message FIRST, and the plot gets stuck being only second in importance. This puts an obvious damper on the storyline, because you are forced to swim through countless arguements, discussions, and graphs on global warming, and the plot takes a hit as a result.The storyline is, however, suspenseful at times. If you are like me and have read virtually every Michael Crichton book, this book is worth reading. If you haven't, read his other books first (Jurassic Park is my personal favorite), and then find time for this one."
1,My last Crichton,"If the writing was interested in alienating people, he certainly succeeded with me. How dare he try an pass off this garbage as a novel in the first place. And then use his novel: bought with my money and taking my time to read, to issue a monologue on how he doesn't see eye-to-eye with the global warming campaign. I resent him using his previously good name to see this kind of rubbish. I certainly will never read another book from him again."
1,disgraceful,"It was bad enough when Crichton penned the misguided, xenophobic Rising Sun, but the dangers of global warming are so accute, the author has truly disgraced himself this time. Just this month New Scientist magazine published an article on the disappearance of the Carteret Islands, which are literally being swallowed by the rising sea. And this quack has the audacity to question the near-unanimity of the scientific community with his half-baked reactionary polemic. Why exactly does he think the 10 hottest years on record have been in the last 14 years?The very idea that global warming is some kind of mass movement is utterly preposterous. If Crichton spent any length of time around climatologists not in the employ of the oil industry, he would learn the difference between belief based on a mountain of evidence and paranoia."
1,Not a good book,"I am a long time fan of Michael Crichton, but I have to say that State of fear is his worst work. In my opinion it is a collection of papers, researches etc taken from the internet, built into a unexiting plot but the worst thing is that many of these ""researches"" Crichton is using are totally wrong, I share Crichtons views on the subject in the book, but I think he should have researched this book better and come up with a more exiting story around these issues.And the part in the book that takes place in Iceland, Oh my god, what a load of crock, FYI Crichton, Per is not a icelandic name, has never been and is even not allowed in the icelandic name register, and talking about the countries renewable energy, check out Iceland, no oil and no coals are used for heating houses f.x. all our energy comes from thermal boreholes and our electricity from waterplants, and we are even using hydrogen busses... check your facts please..."
2,Almost unreadable,"Fought a lot to reach the end of the book, but managed to accomplish it! This is the worst book by Crichton I've ever read. It's simply boring, no memorable characters."
1,"Get to the point, already!","Given my relatively positive experiences with some of Crichton's novel's, I thought I'd tackle his take on current environmental controversies. I recall seeing a TV new show interview where a pro-global warming pundit was concerned that people would read ""State of Fear"" (2004), and become absolutely convinced that global warming was a hoax. As is the case with so many issues, the jury's still out on exactly what to do to effectively make a real-world difference.While the novel's narrative logs more than 600 paperback pages, I gave up less than halfway through. Crichton's dialogue kept covering the same ground over and over again, and he kept shoving his characters down extraneous rabbit trails that seemed designed to simply drag the story out.If this book is ever adapted as a movie, Crichton will have to streamline the story's structure, and just get to the point."
2,Confusing,"Crichton is an action writer who can produce some good books (Timeline, The Great Train Robbery etc) but this book was overly long, contained woeful amounts of preachy dialogue and the story itself was pretty weak.I like the premise that fear is good for governments but it could have been handled better in this novel where the author seemed intent on producing a large book with indepth footnotes to show the load of research done but he forgot that people read fiction to be entertained. Yes, it is good to learn from these book but entertainment is the number one goal."
2,Failing State of Fear,A thrilling well crafted read. But disappointingly dishonest. Very one-sided presentation of the climate change issue both in regard to what was left out and the use of characterisation and story-line to give the impression the environment movement is either nave or nasty. If only life were that simple.
1,Oh! The pain!,"I also had a major problem finishing this one. One night I had chronic insomnia,a nd I managed. But only out of duty. Like many of the other reviews here, the book was spoilt by the author spoliticing, and all that on top of an unbelievably dull and unoriginal plot. Zero stars.Ralf"
1,State of Politics,"I saw Michael Crichton on CSPAN as the guest speaker for the Heritage Foundation, a right wing think tank. I have no problem with the Right or Left trying to influence the culture. But the way Mr. Chrichton did it was sneaky! I enjoy his books. But this was a political right wing commercial. He should have written a non-fiction book with his arguments.His apperance with the Heritage Foundation also made me wonder if he was hired to sell a point of view?"
1,Mediocre Novel As A Front For Social Commentary,"I enjoy Crichton as an author, he has a varied and exciting body of work... and that makes this effort all the more disappointing.He uses this novel as a means of sharing his commentary on the state of environmentalism. It comes through as 80% commentary and 20% fiction. It causes his normally engrossing characters and storylines to become shallow, predictable, and tied together by a very disjointed storyline.If Crichton has valid concerns and facts he feels a need to share, he should write a non-fiction book on the topic. His name would still help it sell many copies.Hopefully he will return to true non-fiction writing for us fans of the stories that brought him credibility as a writer."
1,awful!!!!!,I have read all of his books and this was a simple text book preaching glossed over as a science fiction story. After reading over 380 pages I quit in discust. Robin Cook has started to preach about society-now Criechton. I have an Ivy League education and a doctorate but refuse to reach my Peter Principle and insult the people around me. I would not give this book 1 star if 0 was a choice.
1,Boo: irresponsible writing!,"This book is a sad, sad excuse for entertainment and/or science. Yes, there ARE doubts as to the veracity of global warming, but these are raised by a very very small minority of scientists. The majority of scientists, politicians, and plain ol' citizens agree: our world is getting hotter due to our intervention. Even if you don't agree with this, the plot was terrible, the women were all beautiful and athletic and yet still fell for the dopey lawyers, and the dialogue was stilted. He's a great writer when he's on the top of his game, but this book is far from that lofty pinnacle..."
1,Discredited Hack,"Let's not forget that this is the man who brought us 'Journeys'. An ignorant, anti-science debacle that removes him forever from the ranks of the literate. Was he commissioned by Big Oil to write this nonsense? Can anyone now believe that global warming isn't real? And he has children and no thought for them or of the world they will inherit?A hack. The man can't write."
1,Very sad,Almost embarassingly bad. Its not hard to see who has the agenda here.All one needs to see is how the creationists are lining up to endorse this book.
1,Audubon Weighs In,For those of you who want a detailed and in-depth review of the shameful pseudo-science behind this book would do well to read the article in the May 2005 issue of Audubon.http://magazine.audubon.org/profile/profile0505.html
1,pathetic,i feel sorry for future generations if people now are to believe the claims by Crichton. and i thought he was a good guy too for writing jurassic park.
3,crichton rewrites the same story again,for a superior version of a lot of the same material see David Brin's Earth. Once again Crichton lifts sf cliches and produces a mediocre repackaging of them.
2,"Not his best work, but still good.","The criticisms of this book seem to fall into two groups:1. Diatribes against Crichton's debunking of global warming2. Critiques of the unlikely characters and plot twistsYou can dismiss #1 -- that's just a bunch of people whose religion is being threatened. And make no mistake, environmentalism is a religion to many people. #2 is legitimate criticism. Some of the stuff that happens in the book is far-fetched to the point of silliness. Overall, though, I think Crichton's two aims were to write a reasonably entertaining story, and to cast suitable doubt on the idea that the earth is turning into a deadly, hot greenhouse and we have to do something NOW!I believe he succeeded in both aims."
3,High Quality merchandise - average story,The story met its purpose - allowing me to relax during driving. But it wasn't Crichton's best work. 3 stars.
5,Fun to read and will challenge your beliefs,"Interesting, thought-provoking and easily readable. Recommended for any Crichton fans or environmentally conscious fiction readers. Not for the die-hard Al Gore/global-warming-hysteria supporters."
4,Very informative and entertaining to boot,"This is a very fast-paced, action packed novel and a enjoyable read. The book deals with global warming and Crichton does for the environmental movement what Dan Brown does for the Catholic Church in ""The DaVinci Code"". It is extremely well researched, as Crichton novels are, and very informative. I found myself googling references, organizations, and scientific findings. You are sure to learn a few things through this book. The only drawback is that it went just a little too long and a couple of characters go through so many near-fatal experiences that you have to roll your eyes that they survived it all. But that's entertainment, right?"
1,Whoa,"I wasnt scratching my head going ""Hmmmmmmmm"" as one review here puts it. I was cradling my head in my hands going ""Arrgggghhhhhh...... make it stop....... make it stop"". What a terrible, terrible novel. It is boring to the extreme. Forget the flag-waving, be it pro or anti whatever the greens here are crying about. It was just so very bad. I am more entertained by the five-star reviews here. You guys must be seriously hard up for a good read.J.R."
1,Worst Michael Crichton Book Ever,"First of all, let me say I've read just about every Michael Crichton book on the market and I will go to bat for his story-telling and writing style any day. Ten out of ten times, I love me a Michael Crichton book.However, this book falls well short of the mark he has set for himself with such classic titles as Jurassic Park, Timeline and Prey. There is just nothing fun about State of Fear whatsoever. The characters are paper thin, the story is slow and boring and the writing style just doesn't feel like Michael Crichton at all. I don't understand.If you're looking for a fun read, this is not it. If you're looking for a well-written Michael Crichton book, this is not it. I love Michael Crichton books, but I wouldn't recommend State of Fear to anyone. Stay away."
2,"Started out boring, and",Got better as I read; but so much of it was not believable. People trapped in a crevasse in Antarctica almost dying of frostbite then just bopping around a few days later as if nothing had happened??Please! And octopi in baggies ??? Please! Never really explained who Kenner was. Too much lecturing...this is supposed to be a novel. But I admit I was glad that noxious character got eaten by the cannibals!!
1,Really terrible,"This is one of the worst books I have read in a very, very long time. Implausible, disorganized, preachy. I loved Jurrasic Park, but State of Fear should have stayed in the file cabinet."
3,"No, not his best.","Engaging, entertaining environmental thriller with some twists, however, not all surprising. Not close to what Mr. Crichton is capable of. A believable story line, especially considering the provocative topic. Characters were well developed - seemed a little rushed toward the ending though. Really an easy summer read with a believable story line."
4,Iconoclastic technothriller,"A mass market vehicle with an anti-establishment viewpoint. Honestly, I shouldn't have been surprised at its entertainment value--Crichton is an old hand at pleasing the reader. One caveat: this is a fictional work-- don't expect it to be otherwise. If you want non-fiction about global warming, it seems that every week a new theory bursts on the scene. I absolutely enjoyed Crichton's version, neither fact nor purporting to be. No fifth star because I compare all science fiction to Ray Bradbury--interpret that however it best helps you."
3,A fair read,"I started this book with great anticipation and was justly rewarded for the first few chapters. I then began to think that the author had given the plot and character development a back seat to expressing his own views about the global warming controversy. The book jumps back and forth between what could have been an exciting to plot to a didactic on the fallacies of the global warming scare. I never really understood who the bad guys were and what they were trying to accomplish. Even the ""good"" guys agenda was never fully explained. There are many plot ambiguities.I have no problem with an author expressing their views in a novel, but at least be consistent. Either write a fiction novel with the opinions worked into the plot or write a non-fiction novel and lay out the facts with footnotes and references. Mixing the two does not make for a great book."
3,"Good plot, but don't expect any character development","The plot is good and engaging, but don't expect to learn anything about the characters. Crichton doesn't develop any of the character's back stories and it's unclear what their motivations are."
5,Couldn't put this book now,"I read the 500+ page State of Fear in one week. The fastest I have ever read a book, I could not put it down! The combination of suspense and actual scientific facts on Global Warming was very fun to read. I love all the religious environmentalists who denounce this book, while probably not even reading it first. Open your minds, there is never a consensus in anything. The cry of ""Scientific Consensus"" borders on totalitarianism by trying to shout down the minority party and effectively silencing their voice. Lets worry about helping the starving of the world, instead of wasting billions of dollars on a supposed theory when examined further is nothing but hot air!"
4,Critical Thinking isn't Criminal...So Far,"In State of Fear, Crichton faces up to issues that are now entrenched in a dogma matching the religiosity of the abortion debate. You can expect the reviews to be hypercharged by political leanings. As a novel, State of Fear reads well enough. It's a suspense story that presents the problem that occurs when science becomes political. The distortion of research would be a challenge for any dramitist, but Chrichton brings the issues and data into a realm of discourse, making it possible to consider issues and the flaws behind the agendas. I enjoyed reading State of Fear and commend Chrichton for his critical thinking."
2,Confusing...,"I started reading this book and I've read the first 50 pages. Sadly, I am dissapointed because I never got into the story and the characters change very rapidly and it's difficult to keep track who is who in this book.Bottom line is this:Very difficult to understand the story and what is actually going on from the beginning of the book. Characters change from ""destination"" to ""destination"" and they never come back so you're starting from zero every time.---I read three of Crichton's books before and they were good, but this one is awful."
2,State of Boredom,"I am a big Michael Crichton fan and have read all of his books. Unfortunately, this book as a novel just bores me. It would have been great written as a non-fiction book on the theory of climate change -- but can only give it two stars. Too many of the characters were two-dimensional, the action scenes were not thrilling, and the plot was mostly lame and unbelieveable. The information provided in the book about climate change was pretty interesting, but didn't go far enough to convince me either way. When I pick up a novel to read I want to be entertained; with a factual book I want to be informed. This attempt falls short in both categoies."
3,State of Fear Falls Short of Esau Swindle Standards,"Dr.Bogen's online review got me enthralled with The Esau Swindle. I too had been looking for a new thriller. I checked The Broker, and State of Fear to find out what's hot. The Esau Swindle by Gerald Rothberg came up and caught my attention. Rothberg has a brilliant sense of timing and an incredible way of melding mystery, assassination attempts, beautiful Buenos Aires, art forgery and crime. I'm a doctor too. I read thrillers to relax my mind. As they say a good book is hard to find, but The Esau Swindle is bold. Thank you Dr. Bogen. I will e-mail my physician friends and let them know about the Esau Swindle. -- Dr. Greg Selde"
2,a little disappointed,"I used to be a big fan of Michael Crichton, but after reading this book I am a little disappointed. First off, too many things happen to the main character in three days, almost dying in the South Pole, then, back to the US, then getting poisoned in his own apartment (stung by a sea creature) getting out of the hospital a few hours later to attend a conference and the story goes on.. too unbelievable- But what makes me sad is that Michael Crichton is selling the idea that man is not damaging the environment, that global warming doesn't exist - I liked his other books because they seemed accurate to me - but after reading State of Fear, I wonder if all the facts in his other books, are just facts of fiction!"
2,Preachy To The Extreme,"Dont' waste your money on this one...huge sections of the book are nothing but diatribes against environmental organizations, the data they use to support their claims and the all to easily manipulated media. He may even be correct in some of his anti global-warming messages but that's not the point.If Crichton wanted to express his viewpoints, then he should have done so outside a fictional book that is promoted on the front cover as ""edge of your seat storytelling"" when in fact it's drop dead boring!"
2,instructive; dogmatic; preachy; educational - not a novel,"State of Fear is neither fish nor fowl and Crichton's conflicted goals make for a poor novel and lousy characterization. I am listening to the audiobook, and the preachier parts are downright agonizing and drag the action down. The characters are more like caricatures; Peter Evans is the central mouthpiece, but who can identify with his passive voice? It's obvious he's simply a mechanism. The action scenes are good, but not good enough to overcome the reams of techical babble that rightly deserves to be addressed in a non-fiction setting. I agree with much of the premise of the book, but if you're looking for entertainment, or just good writing, this isn't it."
3,Didactic,"A well-documented analysis of environmental politics wrapped in a fast but flimsy plot. The bibliography is worth looking into - I'm ordering from it myself, Amazon should post links - but the plotting, characterizations and dialog are well below Crichton's normal standards."
5,"Great Read, Excellent Facts, Environmentalists threatened his life over this book","This is a great book. It is a good read and unveils the hoax of Global Warming and the religion it has become. Crichton does an excellent job and keeps you interested all the way through. The facts he uses are well researched and will make you wonder what Al Gore and his friends are really up to.If you like good fiction, based on real facts, and want a great read then get this book. You are in for a treat!"
3,Way too long,"I felt this book was entirely too long. There were some exciting scenes: the Antartic scene and the jungle scene at the end. What would've made this book a LOT better, given its volume, would be to have a lot more natural disasters caused by man; not just a tsunami."
2,Science aside -- plot made no sense,"All the reviews here argue for or against MC's scientific position. Personally, while I think it's good to question conventional wisdom, I think global warming is as accepted as the Earth going around the Sun. That aside, I suspended my disbelief in the scientific argument in the book in order to enjoy the story. That's where the problem lies.The story is ridiculous. I won't give any spoilers that aren't in the book's description, but if you were a federal agent trying to stop eco-terrorists, with thousands of lives at stake, would you call in a) the Delta Force, b) the Marines, or c) a young lawyer and a secretary?That said, with disbelief in the science and the ridiculousness of the plot suspended, it was a fun page-turner. But there are better books out there to read."
4,DyNANOmite!!!,"Hi-tech sci-fi thriller based on nano-technology gone awry. A good read for a techie/science mind. If you don't enjoy technology or don't understand it, this book will probably not be for you."
2,So Much for a Big Name...,"I have read several Crichton novels and found out that State of Fear is slightly better compared to Prey. Thus, a 2 star.It started quite convincing. But the remaining three quarters just a mix of airplane flights all over the world, a lawyer adventures and bunch of Global Warming data churned out for mass market. Though the information provided by Crichton is in top-form as usual, it just doesn't fit trying to smuggle so many technical charts and information into this novel. The book becomes somewhat ""too non-fictional."" Credit still must be given for his extensive research showing mostly that Global Warming trend is nonetheless a ""fiction"" itself.Well, for people thinking this will be another Jurassic Park, Sphere or Timeline, you will find it disappointingly wrong. Sorry, I don't like this book at all. Not worth reading to the end."
2,Disappointing,"If Michael Crichton wants me to enrich him by spending money for his hardcover ""novel,"" he can at least give me a the kind of good story I expect from someone of his caliber. He says everyone has an ulterior motive except himself - as he laughs all the way to the bank! How much better it would have been for him to be up front and write a non-fiction book on the subject. Shame on you Mr. Crichton....you owe us."
1,State of Fear,"Very, very disappointing, Michael seams to be trying to both make a statement about his view of some environmentalists, and citing references about realities in a fiction Novel ??? We all understand that there is real science backing the general theme of his other novels, but this is 774 pages of ridiculous material that is non entertaining at all. I think he may be losing his step to over sensationalist Dan Brown. Anyhow, I did not think it merited the cost or the length."
1,Based on Inaccurate Premise,"The premise of this book is false, misleading and inaccurate. And that is saying it nicely. It is hard to take the story seriously when it is founded on such poor interpretation of the facts and science. I am very disappointed in his foray into espousing political beliefs instead of telling a good story. And I just can't get over the premise... beware the evil conspiring environmentalists!!! Give me a break... I advise Crichton fans and everyone else to pass on this subpar book."
1,Glowingly promoted book,"Generally I like Michael Crichton books and style of writing, but this story is very boring and long winded. I didn't mind his overwhelming lecturing if the characters were not predictable. The characters seemed like robots, not something you will expect out of human beings. Everyone in this book is one dimensional, forgettable, and unconvincing. I wonder if some wealthy Republican paid to have this book published and be glowingly promoted?"
1,Winner: worst book I ever read (listened to),"I might have read a worse book at some point in my life, but I don't actually remember doing so. I was on a road trip and picked up the audiobook version at a Wal Mart. I truly regret contributing any money toward this book's cause. The story is formulaic and cheesy -- it's only there to act as a thin veil for the book's message. The message, believe it or not, is: global warming isn't real; to the extent global warming is real, we don't need to worry about it; the planet naturally changes all the time and can cope with any stress humans put on it; and it's okay to cut down sequoia trees because they didn't exist until a few thousand years ago. Impressively stupid."
1,It is a good $2.99 special,Scientific data (including references) + (poor plot and badly written characters) = one confusing NOVEL
3,"Nothing great, but still fun","You can't get much more blue-state, ACLU-card-carrying commie pinko than me, but I still respect Michael Crichton's right to stuff whatever Limbaugh-lovin' red meat he wants into his novels. You buy a Crichton for an entertaining, quick read, and this one delivers. So what if there's some propaganda in there? Read any Barbara Kingsolver lately? At least Crichton doesn't indulge in the treacly self-congratulation of leftist novelists. At least there's no sharing, no rapturous discovery of the moral superiority of people of color, and no orgasmic vision quests. He also has the guts to lay his ideas out there at the end instead of trying to force everything into the mouths of his characters. Face it, Crichton's characters are always two-dimensional mouthpieces for something, it's just that there aren't any dinosaurs around to claim that they were misrepresented in ""Lost World."" Get over yourselves, people. It's Michael Crichton!"
2,State of Fear? More like State of boredom.,"I am a big Michael Crichton fan and quickly scooped up this book at the local library in hopes of another thriller, but was disappointed by this overly technical, long-winded book. Typically Crichton uses technology as a backbone to the story but gives us characters to tell the story. In State of Fear he is so intent on bombarding us with ecological data, usually presented in a ""I know what I'm talking about and you don't"" tone by Kenner that the book reads more like a Save the World brochure from WWF. After being entertained and riveted by his previous books I only finished this one in hopes of seeing the pace pick up and the story get exciting. I was let down on both fronts.Pass on this Crichton book and hope the next one is better."
2,two stars is already too generous for this bad novel,"wasted a whole day trying to read along with this terribly written novel. every chapter is a date, time and a place, but to what purpose? morton? funds? environmental issues? drake? gulfstream? beverly hills? latte? paris, london, vancour, epa, lawsuits? crichton could not even make that peter evans look like, sound like, read like a real lawyer but a go-getter stupid moron. so many leads, so many unnecessary issues, chapters, bad dialogues, murders....blahblahblah...what's going on and what's the purpose of writing this piece of junk? why i have to waste time to read along?I knew crichton is not a good writer, but i've never known that he's so bad. maybe his novels are only good for making into movies, but definitely not good for reading. i should have given up this reading the day before yesterday, then i didn't have to pick it up and open it. sigh......"
1,worst book I've ever read!,This was a real page turner and I couldn't wait to finish it-only because I was on vacation on a remote island and that was the only book I had. having picked it up at the airport. More unbelievable than any Dirk Pitt. The main character a Jr. BH estate atty finds himself in the middle of ecoterrorists conspiring to wreak havoc and finds himself trapped in a remote arctic ice crevass only to survive and face death in other remote parts of the planet in the space of 3 days. The science is spurious at best more so in regards to human culture than global warming. He uses statistics to disclaim global warming in the slickest of ways that would make Mark Twain blush. It's just so implausible and shallow why did he bother writing it? Michael get some spirituality please-we are human beings not robots.
2,"98% Science, and 2% story","Im not a scientist and dont pressume to know anything about global warming beyond what I read in the news, but Michael Crichton clearly has a passion for debunking it. Fine, but is that why someone would buy his book? I was hoping for some sci-fi adventure, and instead picked up a several hundered page research paper. The story itself was loosely thrown in, and not very believable. Not that the cloning of Dinosaurs in Jurrasic park was believable, but it was alot more interesting then this book about a secret agent and a couple of lawyers trying to thrwart a coorperation of Eco Terrorists. Seriously, why not send in the Marines instead? It wasnt horrible and gave a new perspective on global warming that I'm not used to hearing, but again, thats not why someone would buy a fiction book!"
1,Worthless drivel,"All of the ""facts"" in this crappy book have been refuted or were never proven in the first place.What's surprising is that someone who graduated Harvard Med School couldn't tell the difference between hard science & hogwash science, or maybe he could but just didn't care.Try reading a review of this godawful book at ""Scientific American"" or any other science magazine.BTW I like Crichton a lot, but this book really sucks"
2,What happened?,"Michael Crichton's latest works have been far below the standard he set with books such as Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Stain, and Sphere. His most recent effort was hugely disappointing and frustrating to read because he got so overwhelmed with the science he forgot about the plot.The book barely held my attention for the first 250 pages or so - I kept reading in hopes of finding something that would. The characters are poorly developed and seem to slide in and out of character traits. I especially got confused with the relationship between Evans and Sarah versus the relationship between Evans and Jennifer. Which one was Evans supposed to be chasing?Mr. Crichton got so fact-happy that he relied on very technical information, data, and graphs to keep us hooked on the barely-existent story. It was a poor tactic and should not be repeated.If you're looking for a good Crichton novel, don't pick this one."
1,Ugh.,"While it's not unknown for Chrichton's books to offer up stilted dialog from one dimensional characters, the plots are usually entertaining enough to keep one's interest. Sadly, that's not the case with State of Fear, which offers up not only bland, utterly forgettable characters, but a plot that is just absolutely mind-numbingly stupid. Throw in his 10,000 citations and the ""Kenner"" character that comes across as little more than a bully pulpit from which the author spouts opinions and I can guarantee that this will be the last Crichton book I read.Don't waste your time... Life is way too short to spend your time reading this drek."
2,Great Concept... But,"MC explores many interesting concepts here, global warming, social fear, etc. However outside of the concepts the characters that compose this book are at points near laughable. An NSA agent who has trouble getting a gun or even enlisting a commando squad to take out extreme environmentalists? Please. A sexy LA assistant who's good with a gun. Ick. Really I think I could get more mileage out of 1940's gumshoe novel.While the concept is engaging, the story is not. Pound for Pound I think I would of gotten more out of reading one of the reference materials MC listed."
2,Best thing about this book are the essays and bibliography,"Even though I agree with a lot of Crichton's political views (and this book is highly political), the book's world is a bit silly: All the ""pro"" global warming characters are steel jawed action heroes who kill without hesitation and can survive lightning strikes and multiple gunshots, and the ""anti"" global warming characters are simpering, lying, cheating wussies and scoundrels. Well, you don't read a Crichton novel for character development and introspective dialog, and like other Crichton novels this one does have an interesting back story, good background research, and will make a profitable Hollywood action movie. The best part is the bibliography and the essays/talks in the appendix included the E-Book edition I read - if those are not included in the print editions look for Crichton on C-Span. He's an interesting speaker, and not as politicized as this novel would have you believe."
2,More Screwed Up Science,"In honesty I haven't finished this book. I think I got close to the end but it got more and more boring as I went further in. Like previous Crichton books, you should not read this if you have any type of science background. Crichton is guilty of using the same flawed logic and irresponsible conclusions he criticizes environmentalists of using. I am a pretty much to the center of the political spectrum and often get more tired of enviromentalists grossly exaggerating certain dangers more than I get tired of those to the right completely ignoring the dangers. That was why I was first interested in reading this book, however Crichton does not address what the radical left is trully guilty of, rather he uses spurious claims of the minority of experts in an effort to dismiss what is by any serious scienctist's account, one of the greatest dangers facing the planet. Simply put, Crichton has not gotten any better, and has in fact, gotten worst."
2,The Real Fear is that this book will never end,"I've been a huge Crichton fan - reading all his books and enjoyed all. Even this book starts off with really exciting beginning, however the story tends to drag on for hundreds of pages of anti-global warming boring scientific discussion matched with a level of unrealistic story turns that don't really tie together by the end of the book. It also has a morbid sense about it given its untimely topic of tsunamis.Unlike other Crichton novels, I will not be saving this one to read again."
1,His worst work yet,"Oh come on. Michael Crichton has written his worst book yet, if you want to call it that. I don't mind author's using their books to promote their personal agenda. If I agree with Mr. Crichton's views are not is not the point. THIS BOOK WAS BORING! The action was dull, the preaching was monotonous and the characters that didn't agree with the hero were all pretreated as pompous idiots. Mike, you can do a lot better!Bryan"
1,A surprisingly naive effort,"In nearly every previous book - from ""The Andromeda Strain"" to ""Jurassic Park"" - Crichton has struck me as being a true erudite... a learned man. And yet, in this book I was shocked, quite frankly, by how one-sided his argument was AGAINST the theory of global warming. As a trained physician with a clear curiosity about all things science, Crichton seems to have put forward a work of fiction based on fictional evidence. I've always enjoyed turning to his books for their escapist qualities that seemed grounded in the latest thinking. It's just too bad he's abandoned his roots."
1,Unpleasant read,"I think it was poor form of the author to try and manipulate the general public into believing his view of the Global Warming issue. Pretending to be working with facts, and deliberately biasing what he tries to sell as a balance arguement is a disgrace. No more Crichton for me."
5,Not his originial intent...,"I am intrigued by Crichton as a writer in general. It is a known fact that he researches painsakingly for his novels (he even cites sources and footnotes facts). For this book, his intent was to reserach Global Warming, and write a novel based the phenomenon. What he discovered is that what the general public understands as ""Global Warming"" is a sham, and his novel ended up telling a very different story form what he originally intended. The story is intriguing, and has a a shockingly menacing plot. A good read!"
4,Good one,"There are a lot of strong opinions on the book and for good reason. The book covers some controversial issues: I.E. validity in the globaly warming theory. I thought that the story was excellently paced and exciting while scattered with carefully selected pieces of information regarding global warming.Regardless of your stance on the -theory- of global warming it should be emphasized that people are profitting, GREATLY, from the concept. Even if you are a die hard advocate of the theory I'd recommend the book because it does lead one to wonder about the organizations with which they choose to associate."
3,"Good, but not great","Crichton uses the book as soapbox for his personal views. He does a fair job of backing them up with copious footnotes, but it gets tiresome. The plot is thin and far fetched in places."
2,More Message Than Plot,"Michael Crichton has a talent for combining high tech info with old fashioned fun and excitement such as in Timeline and Prey.Sometimes however the details overwhelm the story(Airframe) and this book despite plenty of entertaining close calls is pretty much a mess.The goofy mishmash of a plot is probalbly the first in history to have environmental terrorists shooting lightning bolts at cub scouts and features more graphs than any book I've read since high school.Crichton asserts that global warming is a myth and uses every character,graph, and factoid that he can to prove his point bringing the flow of the book to a grinding halt every 20 pages.It's a thoughtprovoking topic worthy of discussion but it's poorly incorporated into a sloppy plot.At least it's ambitious but I kept expecting to find a test at the end of the book."
5,Classic Crichton,This book was perfect to read and wonderful to carry on the plane. I read it too quickly but that is because I could not wait to see what was happening next. I love the movie too but the book was the best
4,Excellent use of scientific facts to provide a backdrop for a thriller,"Crichton, as in the past, uses scientific facts to provide a compelling backdrop for a thriller. Crichton creates compelling and interesting characters to deal with environmental extremism and terrorism. This would make a great movie...it will be interesting to see if the hollywood elite have the guts to deal with this subject."
2,"Weak on plot, long on lecture","I found myself rushing through this book, not because a gripping plot was pulling me along, but to get it over with. I hoped, chapter after chapter, for some redeeming qualities, but found very few to praise. Mostly, I got tired of being lectured for page after page."
3,Not Crichton's best,"State of fear is not Crichton's best work. I found the ""thriller"" to be some what boring and lacking in suspence, and I struggled to finish the book. Crichton's message that global warming is a farce seems outdated and foolish."
3,"An interesting work of ""faction""","Thin plot. Not especially well developed characters. But I suspect the novel is simply a tool for stating Crichton's beliefs on global warming and several tangental topics. It will be unfairly trashed by enviro-nuts who cannot stand to see their orthodoxy challenged by something as trivial as peer-reviewed research, and it will be unfairly praised by the industrial-fossil fuel weenies who search desperately for every pebble that they can throw at Greenpeace.If you are looking for a typical techno-thriller, this might not be your kettle of collards. If you can stand to have your unfounded ideas and popular prejudices challenged, you might give it a try.After all, it isn't often that you find a work of ""fiction"" that has a bibliography that is actually worth reading."
4,Facts speak louder than induced fear...,"A thought-provoking novel about popularized perceptions versus scientific thinking, exposing some of the facts and myths about global warming, environmentalism, and wildlife management - all in the context of an action-packed adventure novel. While some environmentalist may feel the book attacks many of their causes, the book is more of a critique of all of us - how we sometimes get lazy with our own critical thinking and rely too heavily on common and manipulated public perceptions. If you like Crichton's books, you'll certainly enjoy this one!"
4,State of Fear,"Before reading this book I had gone along with the mainstream thoughts on global warming. That being, that we as a whole, have created a situation by our use of fossil fuels, that has changed the earths' environment. Crichton exposes some of the fallacies and thinly documented ""proofs"" that we have created an irreversible apocalyptic situation. Through his use of scientific documentation and exquisite storytelling, I now believe that most of global warming is a natural process that has been ocurring and recurring for eons. By no stretch of the imagination am I an ""anti-environmentalist"". Facts sometimes speak louder than emotions. This book is a wakeup call to look at known realities before jumping to conclusions."
5,One of his best,"I highly recommend this book to any Crichton fan, and anyone who is interested in the environment. Excellent; one of his best!"
2,A Disappointment,"For anyone who reads Michael Crichton for his wonderful play of mind on the ""what-ifs"" of science and technology, you'll be sadly disappointed with this one. Nothing exceeds the bounds of human capability in this story.As usual, Crichton did his research. If this were a textbook, I'm sure it would be quite a page-turner. And based on my education in environmental studies, I agree with most of what he says. But please, eco-terrorism and dry environmental debates (supported with pages of charts and footnotes) do not a thriller make. Add to that a main character who is led by the nose, a know-it-all abrasive genius/law enforcement agent who does all the talking, typical eye-candy female characters with no important role in the story, and the political-correct minority character (again with no important role), and you get ""State of Fear.""The plot and characters simply cannot support all the scientific data that Crichton throws at you."
4,Atlas Shrugged/DaVinci Code-ish,"Kenner's frequent diatribes on the faulty environmental movement remind me of John Gault's on objectivism in Atlas Shrugged. And, Crichton has shaken up people's scientific and environmental beliefs much like Brown did for people's religious beliefs in the DaVinci Code.I appreciated the wealth of research Crichton put into this book. I read the book in 4 days so it was definitely a page-turner. However, I couldn't give it 5 stars because the ending was weak. I wanted resolution between Morton and Drake. I wanted something to happen between Sarah and Peter. I wanted somebody to be arrested for the many crimes committed. Crichton laid too much groundwork and spent too much time developing so many characters (even though I admit some stereotyping occurred) to just end with Morton's idealistic dreams about re-inventing the environmental movement. Overall, I'm glad I read it."
2,Well well...,"Well, if one is inclined to believe in conspiracy theories that say that scientific researches conducted by scientists have a final report against or favorable to global warmimg, depending solely in who is paying the reasearch (ambientalists or corporations), we could conclude that Crichton was handsomely paid by the corporations!"
2,Where is the plot?,"I had only read Prey before this, so maybe I don't get Chrichton. Where Prey was fast paced, and gripping throughout, I found this book to get boring real fast. Initially, I found the debates on global warming to be intriguing. But just when things are getting interesting (despite the flimsy plot) we have to muddle through pages and pages of more debates that grind things to a halt. By page 250 I think I get the point.The characters are so 2-dimensional. Half the time, I don't know how Evans, the main character, feels about what's happening around him. He's written mostly as an opportunistic wimp. We just get all this dialogue back and forth. Why doesn't Chrichton just call this a screenplay and sell the movie rights. I'm sure the movie will suck, too."
2,boring,"started out pretty good,had great potential if not for that environmental teacher on every page.what i am saying, more story ,less envirofact , woiuld have made a bad book alot better."
3,"Glad I read it, but not because it was good story.","I'm looking forward to reading some of the books he referenced, because I am now more intrigued than ever by the issues raised in the book. However, the plot IS just a pretense for a heavy dose of ""preaching"" about the interaction of media, politics and science (junk and otherwise)- I just didn't mind the sermon. Searchers for a good work of fiction will be disappointed."
2,Not up to his usual standards...,"I just finished reading this book and it is a huge disappointment for a Crichton novel. It is basically a forum for him to show off how much research he has done on the issue of global warming. When he begins to drone on too long, he suddenly puts in a chapter or so of page-turning action. But it does not work. The characters never grabbed me, the action was completely lacking, and it seemed the characters' actions never really amounted to anything. There were many useless characters, or characters introduced early on that never came back to have their storylines resolved. The climax scene was a cop-out. Crichton should have just written a review article for a trade journal summarizing all the publications he read regarding global warming. Skip this book, it is not worth it."
3,Not his best by far...,"I'm sorry, but if I wanted a mind numbing lecture on why the enviromental movement is total bull, I'd have picked that up. This book is an anti-enviroment tyrade thinly disguised as a suspence thriller. As a thriller, the plot was predictable, dull, disjointed, and totally unbelievable. As a enviromental lecture, it was so well researched that it might as well been a text book. I'm a big fan of Chriton, and I usually forgive his tyrades because the plots are usually engaging and exciting. In this book, however, I stopped caring about his caracters half way through it. The funny thing is, the most enjoyable part of this book, in my opinion, was the appendix. If half the book was as engaging and interesting as that appendix, it would have saved it for me. A waste of time."
4,will challenge your opinion about global warming,"I recommend this book to anyone with a developed opinion on global warming. Whatever your opinion is, State of Fear will challenge you to examine it critically with an unbiased mind.The plot starts slowly, but gains speed and becomes compelling. The characters are fairly straightforward, but interesting within the elaborate storyline.I listened to State of Fear unabridged on audio, narrated by George Wilson. Wilson has a dramatic tone that underscores the story's serious themes, but has a fairly narrow emotional range that sometimes flattens the story's intensity."
4,A WELL PRESENTED CASE ABOUT WORLD CONSERVATION,"No matter which side of the fence you are on as regards world environment/pollution, this book should inteest you and you will learn a lot. There is a lot of fact mixed up with the author's creation with a multitude of reference you can check for yourself.The story will keep yu on the edge of your seat and at the same time there is enough mystery to satisfy the most discerning reader. There is a good reason why this is now a best seller; deservedly so. It also points out the stubborness of some people after much proof is given of why they are wrong, yet refuse to change their minds...usually because of vested interests."
4,Too many loose ends,"I gave State of Fear four stars out of my bias for agreeing with all the major characters in their one-sided diatribes against global warming, environmentalists and their organizations, lawyers, universities, and so much more .... well done and thank you MC!However, the underlying story is too skimpy with very little character development. Subplots start and are then dropped. Examples are the Fench girl and her boyfriend, the group that met in Tokyo, why is Kenner's neice working for the wrong side, why is agent Kenner dragging around a troop of civvies into hostile situations and the most flagrant is the lack of any explanation for the dead body."
3,A good story camoflauged in a LOT of lecturing...,"I'm a big Michael Crichton fan, but this one is not my favorite. There is a great story here, with lots of action and peril and mystery, but intermixed with the story is a whole lot of haranguing about the author's view of environmentalism. This haranguing brings up some excellent thought-provoking points, and I think there is probably an uncomfortable amount of truth in what he says, but there is so MUCH of what he says that it detracts from the story. I felt taken advantage of-- my love for the author's work was used to make me a captive audience to his soapbox. That's no worse I suppose than all the commercials in my TV shows and ads in my magazines-- indeed the motivation and truth content is doubtless MUCH better, but it's not what I was expecting in an expensive and much-anticipated audio book thriller."
2,he needs to step down off the soapbox,"At one point, he was one of the most inventive American writers, but now, he is sounding more like an angry old man. His novels no longer veil his morals, Jurrasic Park was good because it was a good story about the dangers of genetics, State of Fear is a piece of crap because it is just Crichton ranting about a group that he doesnt like. If I wanted that, I would read some idiot blog, not pay for a book"
5,"Great read, thought provoking","In this book, Michael Crichton gives a view of the idea of ""global warming"", that we NEVER hear in the media. The documented data he presents is VERY eye opening to how much we really do live in a state of fear unnecessarily and how the media, political scene and others spend billions to keep us misinformed, afraid and duped.Read this book no matter which side of the fence you are on. It is NOT delusional or libertarian.Thanks,Mr.Crichton for writing this book."
1,Forum for Crichton's personal bias,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift and, having enjoyed many of Crichton's books in the past, was looking forward to reading it. The plot was confusing at first and the more I read the more I realized that this book was really just a platform for Crichton to smear environmentalists in general, and to convince people that Global Warming is not a serious concern (or at least not caused by man, or......)The plot suffered greatly by his desire to convince people of his view point. It was not well-balanced at all.I am no expert on Global Warming, but I can sense when someone is trying to manipulate me. While complaining about environmental groups not being objective, this book has the same problem.The characters were not well developed and were very stereotypical.I can not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Waste of paper,"In my opinion, the ""reviewers"" are right to rant. First of all, the novel is utterly bad! Anyway you look it. From a novel perspective, it is downright horrible. And there are more than enough accurate reviews here for me to have to re-review anything about this... well, I would say ""novel"", but that would be stretching it. Second, the ""scientific arguments"" are so one-sided that they themselves become dull and boring, making for an even worse read. If Crichton (and that's Crichton with an ""r"", Leonard) wanted to to make us, the public, think about Global Warming, there are plenty of forums in the popular science literature for that: and there his comments would have got the proper place, and proper review, and proper forum for rebuttal. Like a bad scientist, Crichton presented biased, over-inflated arguments to a naieve audience. This action borders on criminal, and flies in the face of peer-review, something of value to the responsible scientists amongst us. This IS a bad book."
1,"A screen play, not a novel","The characters are not even cardboard cut outs, the plot so implausible it makes the head swim, the action duller than dull but the six hundred page rebuttal to global warming interesting. Why couldn't this book be summarized in three pages? The world could have saved some trees."
1,Boycott this book,"from Jamie Wilson, Guardian:""Michael Crichton's latest novel, State of Fear, is an action-packed thriller in which the hero is a scientist who discovers that climate change is all a fraud. The novel has sold well, but it was still something of a shock yesterday to find its author as an expert witness testifying on global warming in front of the United States Senate. Crichton had been summoned to give evidence by Senator James Inhofe, a Republican senator from Oklahoma, who recently called global warming 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people'. Some scientists speculated that Crichton might be the best witness Senator Inhofe could find. A 2004 survey of 900 peer-reviewed and published scientific papers on climate change failed to find a single one who went against the belief that man-made change is happening and is dangerous.""Boycott this book!!"
2,A waste of time,"I have read Michael Crichton's Great Train Robbery, Prey, Lost World etc. I read the Prey before I decided to buy the State of Fear, excited that this would be a page turner too like Prey. However I was extremely disappointed with this novel, after spending x amount of hours reading 500 pages book, I feel cheated. The book has no character development, there is science too it, but that too is questionable. The facts about global warming are often repititive. Its almost that you can predict the story in first 100 pages. The character of Evans and Sarah only stands out, and the only thing you could look forward too is them falling in love, but that doesnt happen too. Lastly, the end is soo abrupt, that you feel like CRYING... its just OVER. I was so disappointed with this novel that I have decided never to read a Michael Crichton's novel again."
4,Should be required reading,"Anyone who thinks they know everything about global warming and its causes should read this book. In addition to offering alternate points of view, it is simply a terrific read, a fast paced thriller and a great story."
1,Couldn't wait for it to be over!,"Jurassic Park is one of my all time favorite books. But this one was just a snooze fest. Three quarters through the book there were still all these loose threads that didn't add up. Despite a couple of good thrills, nothing really came together at all. When you have to ask yourself when your 10 pages from the end ""what the **** is going on here?"" it is not a good sign."
2,Not as good as you'd come to expect,"State of Fear by Michael Crichton is a good read but doesn't rise to the top as his previous books. It's like reading prey from the nanobug's point of view with a super arrogant nanobug. I recommend you buy the paperback specially if you are a die hard Crichton fan like I am. That way you can enjoy tossing this book accross the room occassionaly as you read the erroneous one sided statements that are made throughout the book, and not put a hole in the wall. It did get my blood boiling a bit. I kept on wondering wether Crichton was being funded by the Bush administration. I still like the writing style...true to form. My first dissappointment with a Chrichton book."
1,Not worth the trouble,"Crichton immerses himself in polemics and forgets he is a storyteller. This book had me screaming, ""Pick a genre!"" This was a poorly written anti-environmentalist manifesto combined with a sketchy, weak suspense yarn. The result is a total waste of time."
2,Typical Plot,I find this book very exciting in the first few chapters until you get into the middle and his plot just goes too far fethched.Marilou Baker
1,Nah!,"We seem to either love or hate this book, and I throw my lot in with the latter group. But come on guys, we don't have to go to war with each other. Play nicely."
1,State of Boredom!,"** possible Spoiler **BORING BORING BORING! OMG this had to be one of the most excruciating books I've ever read! This was less of a ""general fiction thriller book"" as it was an over blown triad. While some of the author's arguments are good ones (and I may or may nor agree that's not important!) who cares?! The action sequences are a great if you can make it though Environmental De-brainwashing 101. So much time is wasted with pages and pages of boring graphs and countless triads debunking commonly held environmental believes. The author's views on celebrities and their environmental causes are pointedly clear. I'm guessing his opinion of Martin Sheen is not very high either. I would say maybe 1/8 th of this book in ""Crichton Worthy"" the rest of it is pointless drivel. When this is made into a movie (and we all know the book was optioned before it was even finished) it will make a much better movie than book. Wait for the movie."
2,Like being in school,"If you're looking for hours worth of lectures on the dangers of not being ecologically conscious, this is the book for you. I really felt like I was being lectured to during the entire reading of this book - and I'm a fairly liberal individual who agrees not enough is done to protect the envirnoment. I just don't look for this sort of ""information"" from my fiction reading, nor do I want to be repeatedly beaten over the head with it. And that is how this felt. I enjoy Mr. Crichton's book, but this one was WAY too preachy."
4,"Short on story, long on science","State of Fear won't be remembered as Michael Crichton's best story but it seems to me he wanted to get his views on the junk science behind the environmentalist movement out there and decided to write a novel to hang his arguments on. Although I wish he had spent more time on the story I have to admit that I still found it a compelling read, primarily because he was so dead-on about junk science. If you want a bit of an education about the environmentalist movement, global warming and the fake science behind them and don't want to bury yourself in dry science papers -- with a bit of a story wrapped around it, I would recommend State of Fear."
2,State of Fear by Michael Crichton,"It is nothing wrong with being a contrarian about Global Warming, and especially pointing out all the special interests that play on the public fear to enrich themselves. Michael Crichton made a good point about that, and that's the best part about this book. The story however is most contrived, incomplete, and amateurish. I was shocked that this book ever saw the light of print."
3,Disappointing Writing for Crichton and Preachy too,"Not up to par as to writing - unlike most Crichton books which are sometimes excessive in detail, this one lacks the detail of the multiple parallel threads. It does not read like most of his work - almost looks as if it were under time pressure or was abridged somewhat from initial draft. Also if government super agency is on top of this, why do the same untrained individuals have to do all the work on each of the 3 major near parallel threads. Also preachy, but that is probably in the mind of the reader as to whether that may be good or bad. But to me it detracted."
3,Interesting but disappointing,"Interesting to know Mr. Crichton's [apparent] politics via his selective use of data while in pursuit of an unpopular [and, according to the MIT Journal]largely unsupported environmental view.Disappointing beside the remaining body of his fiction work -- all of which I have read. If he were otherwise unknown to me, I would not read a further book on the strength of reading this one."
4,A compelling theme.,"Not Mr Crichton's best book in terms of the fiction, interesting, but the heroes are a little too unbelievable for my taste. But it is undeniably his most important book in terms of the message. It should be apparent that the crazed environmental left is alarmed at this book. All you have to do is look at their hysterical reviews of it. Duh. Mr Crichton provides a bibliography and documents sources for all of his data that disproves or calls into questions all of the radical left's sacred enviro-cows, especially global warming. Unless you are a black helicopter type you should read this book, check out the data, and decide for yourself. It will alarm you if you are not already clued in to what is going on."
1,"If suddenly there were no airports, Crighton would never sell another book.","Man, this is garbage. The blurb on the cover, from USA Today, says ""edge-of-your-seat storytelling."" That's a lie. Unless they meant ""slumped over in your seat from sheer boredom.""Do yourself a favor and skip this, the latest in a long series of novels froma writer who only had one novel in him, after all."
1,Solid one star,"The book itself is unbelievably bad. The plot is implausible and full of holes the size of Grand Canyon. All main characters are cartoonish. If I say their motivations are oversimplified this will be a huge understatement.Nevertheless, this book deserves one star rating. Why? Because it brings interesting information and factual data about global warming and human attempts to ""preserve"" environment. It will be especially useful for those whose opinion on the subject was formed by the mass media and baseless ""beliefs""."
1,Absurdity,"One of the worst novels I have read in a long time. I stayed with it to see if perhaps it may somehow redeem itself. It did not. The scientific discussions and data are boring, the characters are not believable and the numerous escapes from death parallel the grade B movie serials I remember from the late 40s and early 50s. In fact they are as absurd as the premise that a trained specialist would ally himself with two amateurs to thwart a well equipped, well financed and dedicated group of eco-terrorists intent on creating mayhem for profit. It is not even a good adventure story. Crichton missed on this one; badly. If he had a message, it got lost in the garbage. Save your money and your time, buy a different book."
1,Really bad!! Hard to believe Crichton wrote this!!,"This was a really bad story. Or I should say ""what story?"" Did Crichton really write this? Apparently he feels the need to ""educate"" his readers with pages and pages of irritating arguements and lecturing between his characters. I got this book to be entertained, not to feel like I'm in the middle of a liberal vs. republican debate. If I want to be educated about a topic, I'll go find a book written by someone actually qualified to write about the topic. This book is a waste of money. Read one of Crichton's earlier books instead."
1,Skip this one unless you have trouble falling asleep.,"This is the worst book by Michael Crichton to date. I am a fan of this author and have never been disappointed until now. I got three quarters of the way through it and finally gave up.Stupid plot, far fetched storyline. Avoid this at all costs.You have been warned. [...]"
1,"Not a novel, just a political viewpoint","Normally, I'm enthused to read Crichton's books, ""Prey"" and other offerings have always held my interest.""State of Fear"" is nothing like his other works.It is a very long, and mostly mundane statement of Crichton's beliefs regarding Global Warming and other environmental issues. The plot is loosely supported by some minor intrigue, which never really interfere's with the long dialogs about the environment.I kept reading in hopes, Crichton would infuse his normallytaught situations and actions.I finished the book only to realize this is nothing more than a diatribe about the environment.He even goes so far as to take the time to ""explain"" his research and beliefs in the ""author's statement"".Give us a break, Mr. Crichton !!!For what it's worth, I share this authors beliefs that not enough is known about our environment to accuse the inhabitants of killing our world, BUT, I bought this book to be entertained, Not to be lectured."
1,It breaks quick,IN lest than 2 weeks it stoped working! Pay more to get a better gun! Dont buy this one it is a piece os S^!@ Its no good.
2,Jams,i got this at first i was like this is cool i shot like 10 bbs and it jammed and you CANT unjam it i tried everything. Don't take it apart ether it will explode when you get the last screw out.
4,One of his best ever,"There and Back was a change of pace for Jeff Beck. His sound became more electronic.This is a departure of his previous albums, Blow by Blow and Wired. Personally this along with Blow by Blow and Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop are my three favorte Jeff Beck albums ever.The two songs on this CD that will open your ears and get your attention are, Star Cycle. The entire album is worth the price of the CD.Star Cycle is not only great guitar but great keyboard as well.The combination of the two is outstanding.The Pump is also on this album. The Pump is probably in my top 5 for the best Jeff Beck songs ever. Jeff Beck uses distortion in much the same way Jimi Hendrix used it to augment his guitar style.No Jeff Beck collection is complete without this album.This is my mind is one of the outstanding albums in Rock history.Jeff Beck is a master guitarist and this CD will show you why."
3,"good tunes, great drums, but the synth bass and synths tarnish it","To me this album would have been way better with a real bassist, and a reduction in the overly ""modern"" (for the times) 80's synthesizer sounds. Other than that, GREAT DRUMMING by Simon Phillips, and most of the tunes are decent catchy simple melodies over a slightly jazz/pop rock fusion sound. This album would be great if it just had a real bassist and less synths (or none at all)."
2,to be fair Flint apologises,I read the end where Flint says he is sorry for collabarating with several authors. I liked the story HE wrote and all the filler brought the stars down. Well I might go but Eric I am weary and battle scarred and worn out. I feel like those four hour social study lectures I endured in college so that I had more time to party and drink beer. The first book WAS that party and now Ive got a hangover so please stop being so loquacious and wordy for your own good and career. Keep the peace.
3,Not as good as the first,Much longer than 1632 and drags on in the end. There is less substance and not as fun. Other than that it was good.
5,"A truly fine book, with well-drawn characters","If you haven't read 1632 yet, please start there. This book _can_ stand on its own, but is much easier to appreciate in proper context as second in a series. That said...In 1633 the authors spend much of their time fleshing out characters who were shortchanged in 1632 -- especially the Simpsons. They also show the effect of 1999 history books on 17th century politics, and of manned flight on a world that only recently thought it impossible.I found the book absolutely fascinating. It's meatier than 1632. Not as much of a romp, but ultimately more satisfying to digest. Now, they just need to get the NEXT book out in record time!"
2,So much talk but where's the story?,"While 1632 had a real story and a heavy dose of history, 1633 was one chapter after another about nothing. Flint spends entire chapters of this 600 + page book of characters hashing out why they should use wood and not steel, going East and not West, and on and on.Europe is gripped in wars as empires battle each other and Flint spends page after page after page with how a radio works.The characters don't develop or grow and have as much depth as the paper they're printed on.I gave up on the book and Eric Flint.If you want to read alternate history, go somewhere else. If you want a soap opera on paper where you can fast forward two or three chapters and not miss anything, this is the book for you."
5,Time Travel and Alternate History--Winning Combination!,"1633 is the sequel to the excellent book 1632, which tells the riveting story of a modern day West Virginia town suddenly cast into the Germany of the past (guess what year?). This one was written in collaberation with David Weber, but I detected no break in the excellent writing style. 1633 takes the story further and develops the political alliances and relationships between the Americans and the Europeans. The naval war battles are graphic. I found it easy to fall into this story, and felt like I was there myself. That's the best test of good writing for me--complete absorption in the plot and characters. I can't wait for the promised 1634--the Baltic Wars. I highly recommend this book...there's something for everyone in it!"
2,Not nearly as good as 1632...,"I was substantially disappointed by this second installment of Flint's brilliant 1632. About two thirds of the way through this very viscous novel I began to ask myself when the payoff would happen. It never did. The material was dense, probably historically accurate, but BORING. Like it was written by a committee.Most novels have some flat spots, but the author(s) usually reward your persistence and patience. Not so here IMHO.And the afterward is a curious thing... Flint waxes enthusiastically about his committee approach to 1633 and further installments of his original 1632 novel. But its almost as if he's attempting to deflect criticism of this approach in advance.To me, novels are mostly entertainment. 1633 reads like a history text. Instead of an afterward by the author, 1633 should have provided a bibliography."
3,"Worked for my application, but maybe not all.","As other reviewers mentioned, these are slightly dimmer than stock incandescent 194's and somewhat directional (despite the 360 degree claim of the package).I bought them as corner marker lights for my 1980 E-100, so the directionality was not really an issue. For my purpose, they are bright enough. For my (or similar) application, I think they do just fine and would reccommend them. Consider brightness and directionality for your application.Unlike incandescents, polarity does matter. If they don't light up, turn them around in the socket."
2,pretty dim,I purchased these to complete my red led interior light swap. This thing is so dim you can't even use it for a dome light. Lighting a match will give you 10x the light of one of these.
2,This is a DVD of a cut version of the film,As indicated in the title of my review-this is a cut version of the film. Nine to ten minutes of the film are missing.Island of Desire aka: Saturday Island
3,"Lovely,Beautiful Linda Darnell + Handsome Tab Hunter","Seen this movie once and the picture quality was just horrible. I'm sure this DVD release has been cleaned up,and will have a good quality picture. Linda Darnell is stunning in this movie.I hope more of her films find a home on DVD. This lovely lady deserves to be remembered."
2,"Great Value, but poor quality control","Brought the combo, great tools, powerful, lighter than the 18v, good feels. It's not loud under operation. But the quality control was terrrible. The Jacob chuch is somehow wobbles, or off center. I can see the driv bit wobbles. when attach to long drill bit, or long masonry bit, you can see it wobbles 1/4"". Still trying to determine why by talking to HOmeDeport and Dewalt. Exchange it once, but same problem with Impact driver. I think there's quality control problem with the latest batch from the factory."
5,"How in God's holy name, can anyone rate it less?","I am a 17 year-old male, and this book elicited extreem emotional reactions from me in that it put me on the verge of tears. Terry entwines the emotions of the reader with the characters, you feel happy for them, sad for their defeats, and exilirated with their victories, as though you the third unmentioned character- living out the experiences with them as their best friend. As for an anylitical book review, i say this is the apex of the series thus far, and though i wish Richard would learn how to control and harness his god-like magic that we have seen glimpses of throughout the books, it doesn't happen. But besides that, for you of the other gender buy this one with a box of kleenx because the end will send you on an emotional high unlike anything you have ever felt. Do not hold me responsible if you fall off that high and right down into flat depression when you have to return to reality. happy reading =D buy this book!!!"
1,"Its bad folks, trust me.","I've read a lot of fantasy in my life, literally hundreds of books. I make my living by writing. I really enjoyed the first couple books in this series, but I couldn't get past the first couple hundred pages of this one. The writing is just bad -- awkward with a capital AWKWARD. This is partly the result of the extreme, over-the-top, knock you upside the head heavy-handedness of the political philosophy that dominates the book's pages. It doesn't matter what political perspective the author is coming from; when a book reads like a spin room one-pager (stretched way, way too far), that's bad. Ayn Rand, who made no attempt to disguise her point of view, looks like a master obfuscation by comparison.Steer clear."
2,Truly Boring,"I didnt really enjoy this book, the last half of it was hard to read. I got bored and skipped some parts.***Spoiler******Spoiler***at the end, I really dont get how Nicci turned from evil side to good side, how did she enlightened at all?? It was stupid, nonsense really... since she's death mistress, ruthless, tyrant and a sister of the dark sworn to the keeper, it is hard to beleive that she finds her ""answers"" and became reasonable. the same thing happened with other sister of the dark's who joined the light side again. goodkind first tells how evil they are, and then without a solid and reliable reason they become good again! bah!"
2,a sad disappointmemt,I think Terry should have changed richard's name to John while he was at it. Ann Rand already wrote this story we didn't need a knock off copy of it. I have faithfully read all the books in this series I think The author should of stopped about three books ago.I do not reccommend this book as good reading.
2,Disappointing--Get to the ending!,"This was the most disappointing book of the series. The author spends page after page trying to move the story from the previous book to the next book. Also, some of the lesser character's motivations are not very well explored. At one point, more than one of the characters are moved to completely change their outlook on life based on seeing a statue. Why? Are they that shallow, or was it not properly explained?I kept wanting to shout at the author: ""Get on with it!"" If he really respected his readers, he would put more of the story into each volume, and go for a shorter series. Instead, he and the publisher will milk his fans' support to a long-awaited ending. For me, that is fine for this series, but I will never start another Goodkind series again."
1,Can the Social Commentary,"Mr. Goodkind would do well to remember that he was a pretty good fantasy writer, and leave the social commentary to those who are qualified. His transparent and uninspired social commentary has completely put me off this series. If you enjoyed the first three, do yourself a favor and forget about the rest."
3,Nice story...old and tiresome ideas,"I must agree with the other pessimists of the group....this is just another dollar in the author's wallet at this point. Anything to keep the best-selling series going. It's a good read, and it's entertaining if you've followed the series, but it is the same thing as 3-5. Kahlan loses Richard, Richard loses Kahlan. Jagang does something nasty to one of his slaves. Someone dies horribly and in detail. Time out for flowers and other natural beauty, which neutralizes the death scene. Then more death and despair. Repeat. This isn't true fantasy...it's a romance novel with a sword. All you need is to chance Richard's name to Lance."
4,One of my favourite from Terry,"Faith of the fallen is easily one of the best Goodkind books in the series. Although in some ways, it's underlying theme could be considered rudimentary, it is satisfying on many levels for the reader. At this stage, Goodkind has mastered his balance of the slow burn while meeting our desire for blood. The novel builds to a delightful crescendo, which in my opinion is not matched until perhaps the last novel in the series. It's a must read for fans, and a worthwhile standalone book for anyone who enjoys a good story."
3,Good Book but ...,"It is a good Terry Goodkind book, but my only disappointment is that the author use again the same pattern. The main character get capture and escape through logic. It was great but I want something more inovative. The guy is a wizard but you wouldn't know. We want some magic, spells of great power, spells of legends. Richard is suppose to be the first in a long time to be born with both side of magic. Please let us know want it means."
2,When will it end ?,"I really enjoyed the first few volumes on the series. The Pace was fast and the story was excellent. Now, it seems that Mr. Goodkind has caught the Jordan's virus and that the serius will drag on and on and on. It always surprises me that people with such vivid imagination will get stuck within one story and never move on.I really think that Mr. Goodkind is good. But the series should finish and he should move on to something else."
3,Better... But same ole song and dance,"Goodkind has shown me one positive and many negative things in this novel. The positive is that he still has the potentiel to write like he did in WFR. I found this novel to be similiar in style where the others have differed. This book is by far the best sense WFR, but thats only cause the others have been that bad. Goodkind doesnt seem to know where he is going with this saga, either that or he has completly sold out to corperate publishing and is milking this Sword of truth for all he can. On a brighter side, even though the plot had absolutly 0!! progression, this book was tons better then the last few and will keep me reading the series. hopefully Goodkind will be patient with this next book and make it good."
3,Another sequel,"Well, yes, since the storyline clearly hadn't ended, a sequel seems necessary, and as long as you've read the rest of the series, you might as well read this one.Never one for subtleties, Terry Goodkind pushes the characters around again, but this time with an explicit capitalist manifesto, complete with Slavic names for the evil characters.Nor does Terry break his own formula of brutalize, brutalize, brutalize, and rather than build anticipation and suspense, the narrative weaves between events, building the odd feeling that while you're reading this part of the plot, more interesting things are going on elsewhere.The signature dramatic-end-to-the-chapter is here, static yet interesting characters, and gushing expressions of love and violence. The intense feeling of deja vu is probably due to strict attention to the formula and the occasional cliche.That being said, the narrative isn't bad at all, and only sometimes veers into the strained or stilted."
3,Deja Vu Take Six,"I'll be blunt. Mr. Goodkind COULD be a good writer. Nice style. Good form. Pretty well-developed characters. Unfortunately, after you've seen the same plot repeated over again and again and again it begins to get...shall I say a tad stale...! I started reading this book and about a quarter of the way in was struck with some incredibly powerful Deja Vu. Hadn't I seen this before? Ah yes, book one- Kahlan and Richard painfully separated and then re-united, Book two- Kahlan and Richard painfully separated and then re-united,Book Three, Book Four, Book Five- Let me guess...,need I go on? It wasn't hard to figure out the plot for the sixth book. MR.GOODKIND, PLEASE, YOU HAVE TALENT! USE IT FOR GOODNESS SAKE!"
3,"Is it over between us, Terry?","Oh,Terry. In the beginning it was exciting. You kept me up late at night and I never regretted one minute. I couldn't wait for your next masterpiece, and you kept me enthralled through each page. Now? I have no trouble falling asleep once I am horizontal with your book. Oh, I don't mind the exploration of the ""depth"" of your characters, your decidedly un-subtle political statements; none of that matters to me. Where's the excitement, Terry? How about a little of that action and magic that drew me in to begin with? I'm not saying it's over, but for pete's sake, can you blame a girl for looking elsewhere when things get stale???!!!"
3,"Okay, okay, I know that already....","While I have thouroughly enjoyed the books in the Sword of Truth series, I'm tired of the repitition. Terry needs to stop writing for the people who have not read the first books and focus on the fans who have read them all. I get bogged down in all the redundant information and lose track of the story. I know it's difficult to write in a series without repeating some information, but enough is enough."
3,Faith of the Fallen: Not Bad,"I have to admit, I've been getting more and more disappointed with Goodkind's later books in the Sword of Truth series. It's fun to read, but it's been getting a bit ridiculous the way Richard always becomes the deux ex machina and complete hero with a god complex. I mean, this man can do anything! From getting people to confide in him and creating masterpieces to--whatever else he does fabulously well, Richard as a believable character is diminishing. Also, Goodkind's ubiquitous preaching about free will and love, etc. etc. through Richard and associated characters is getting pretty tiresome.All in all, though, it's not a bad book. I rooted for Richard and enjoyed the way he was such a man about town. It's a feel-good book for when you're down. However, I wouldn't recommend buying it in hardcover; wait for it in paperback...from the library."
2,Repetitive Repetition,"Unfortunately, Goodkind has overused his formula. It seems that in EVERY novel in the Sword of Truth series Richard and Kahlan are separated by some devious means, and then are reunited in an all-too-cliche overly-tender ending. Frankly, I am rather sick of it. There isn't really any real story. They could've defeated Jagang long ago, but it seems that throwing in boring ""plot twists"" serves only to extend the length of time it takes to get to the end. The only thing I liked was the fact that Richard is an artist... although I don't like him nearly enough to enjoy it. Character development is not one of Goodkind's strong points."
3,"Same, but...","I would agree with many of the reviewers, there is nothing terribly new in this book. It is filled with the same plots as seen before and you just have to wonder how many times can a man be captured and tortured. The book is a summer sequel. It is the same plot, same characters, but with more killing and more fighting and in some ways this is what makes it entertainment. The book is fun to read, it is fast paced which is a nice change from the last book. I would recommend it for the true fan of the series, but with the reservation that the story needs to move on."
4,Great,"I did read the whole serie a few years ago in Swedish translation but the English original is much better. Terry Goodkinds universe is darker, deeper and brighter un-translated :)"
3,Liking the series less and less,"I picked up the first of the series from an Amazon suggestion. Each book in the series makes me want to read the next a little less. The writing itself seems more like what I had to read in Juvenile Literature while getting my teaching certificate, yet the events being described have too much sex and violence (combined into one at times) to be aimed at teenagers."
5,Brilliant,"As soon as I picked up this book to read it, I couldn't put it down. It was non-stop heart-pounding action. From the first page till the last page, this book never slowed down. There was not one dull moment in this book. The fifth book was a bit disapointing (the soul of fire), but Terry Goodkind fully redeemed himself with this latest installment. He is by far the BEST fantasy writer I have read to date, no other authors come close to his ability and talent. Some of his new ideas in this book are truly marvelous and totally original. I am already looking forward to the seventh book and I'm sure it will be well worth the wait. I do not understand how some people can give this book only 1 star, they are obviously reading a different Faith of the Fallen than the one I am reading."
3,Turn Right Young Wizard and Ride to the Sound of the Guns,"As a political theorist, Terry Goodkind makes an excellent fantasy writer. In Faith of the Fallen, his sixth novel in the Sword of Truth series, Goodkind delivers his anti-collectivist message with all the subtlety of a Mord Sith Agiel. I should note, however, that Goodkind's characters are compelling enough to motivate me to wade through the sophomoric polemic to see how their lives continue to develop. For the sake of future installments, perhaps Mr. Goodkind can find another outlet for his need to spread his political beliefs. I'd suggest that he call into the Rush Limbaugh show, get it out of his system, and then get back to writing the quality fantasy literature we've grown to love."
2,Where's Grandpa?,"Did you ever wonder what happened to Nathan Rahl and Zedd? How can anyone say that some characters weren't left out? You don't introduce ""main"" characters and never bring them back into the picture! Goodkind left so many characterts in limbo. Other reviewers were saying something along the lines of "" the story line was so good it was like living in a communist country"". Well I'm sorry but I didn't buy this book to read about the life styles I can so readily see on our own world! This book was a big disappointment! Mr. Goodkind needs to take some lessons from David Eddings! Goodkind doesn't plan on writing another Sword of Truth novel but if he did I will have to say that I would buy it only to see what will happen and to see if Goodkind can recoupe after this sorry tale."
2,Didn't get cover image for my Kindle,"I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image when I purchased the book for my Kindle. I've tried contacting customer service to see if they could find a solution to this problem several times, but no solution was found. Not having the cover image reduced my enjoyment of the book."
3,"Drawn out, typical ""middle book"" in a long series.","Not the best of the six I have read so far in the series but I think a bit better than the prior one. The book is really two parallel stories for most of the time. I found it slow in parts and at other times I found myself getting really angry at the meanness of a key character (so I guess the book worked in that regard as it got to me quite a bit!)Overall the plot did not advance that much and this felt very much a ""middle book"" in a long series. The Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan got similarly a bit bogged down around this point in the saga.All of this said, I will probably start of book 7 pretty soon as my interest in the characters and their fates remains quite high."
3,"The story is great, the kindle draft is junk.","I have been thoroughly enjoy these series, and am current on book 6. I am not wring this review against author, I am simply trying to alert persons who plan on investing in the kindle ersion at this series, expectthe typography and grammar and spell errors to ruin it for you! Is pay too many money to have to read such poor script. Where is Amazon's quality control? I guarantee this series to be fun to read, averaging at least 1 typographical error per page @ approx 16000-26000 pages per book. Often times they occur at key points is storyline and recks much of story! Yay! Me want is cheaper to get real books and not read kindle at this way. Is really too bad, i like read are stories such as this, fun in majik und nice is story, make read real book. I have spent 70$ to make it this far into the series on kindle. Amazon. Should be ashamed forselling a produce of this poor quality. Im truely embarassed to have paid them so much money."
5,Do you love this series as much as I do??,"If so, I invite you to join my msn community, The Sword of Truth! Please e-mail me if you have trouble finding it, or if you have any questions, or if you just want to talk! :) kahlan79@hotmail.com"
3,Terry Goodkind or Ayn Rand?,"First let me say that I enjoyed the book. However, it is obvious that Mr. Goodkind has been reading Ayn Rand lately. Quick comparison of characters Richard = Howard Roark or Henry Reardon. Kahlan = Dagny Taggart. Narez = Elworth Tooey. Nicci = Dominique Francon. Supporting charcters can find comparable doubles in Ayn Rand writings. The objectivist philosophy was handled straight forward and correctly (though with such bludgeoning force it was hard to miss the point). May I recommend that if you enjoyed this book try The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. The philosophy is handled much better and is more subtly studied."
2,"Read it first, then comment","As a former big time Terry Goodkind fan, I am very disappointed by this book. It's the same as many of the others but not as magical, and the characters I've been waiting to see [Chase, Gratch, Scarlet] are apparently a thing of the past too. This is one big rant against socialism, just like Soul of the Fire was a big rant against the Clintons. This is a dumb book, and Goodkind fans will be disappointed, even people who give it 5 stars without reading it."
2,Long Awaited - Disappointed,"I eagerly awaited this sequel. I really didn't expect a novel that left the relm of swords and sorcery into a long winded diatribe on failed Soviet style socialism. Out of 20 tapes in the unabridged version, 17 were boring! I expected the usual action that the other stories in this series excelled in."
4,Likeness to Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand,Does anyone else see the similarities between this book and Atlas Shrugged? Great books. Very like philosophies.
3,"Still like the universe, but tired of the Great Love","OK, OK, Richard and Kahlan love each other. Got it! Now can we spend more time on the plot and less on their pining?It's kind of weird, actually, how much effort Goodkind expends on the Great Love. It is like he is creating something he wished really existed, instead of telling us a story.Still an interesting book, especially the Ayn Randish philosophical debate about fate vs. predestination. I hope that continues. But please, let's see the poor kids moving forward (and not get so beat up so often!)."
2,#00 page book in twice that number! A steal? No,"As with all books, after book one of a series, the author is obligated to bring all readers 'up to speed' with backstory. We are well into the series now and this author fills in backstory endlessly to the point of boredom. If I were not hook on the story, I would have shelved the book. There is an awful lot of exposition ... the why of what is happening. It does get tedious."
5,Morally and ethically wrenching!,"My stomach was in knots throughout this book and there were times I had to put it down and breathe...thanking God that I was ""right-here-right-now"". Terry Goodkind will pull you into his reality so completely that you won't even realize it happened. You will clench your fist and your lip will curl at times; there is no way around the physical emotions that you will undoubtedly be submersed in. His depictions of the Old World are so intense that they became more real than the lands on Earth. No history teacher could make me see another culture as though I were experiencing it, but with this book you WILL experience it. You will live it. Take my word for it, read this series. It will change you. Change."
4,Good at this point in the series,I have enjoyed reading this series. I am stopping with the end of this book since I am a bit bored with the similar storylines at this point. They are well written and easy to read books.
1,"Interesting, but I see several problems here","Wow! The first time I read this book, I was amazed. What a great plot! What a beautiful philosophical discourse! One thousand pages later, I found myself disgusted with the entire book.The one thousand pages I refer to are modern philosopher Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged,"" a wonderful book which I am not reviewing here. However, I will say that the book describes her philosophy, objectivism, which is remarkably similar--read, identical-- to the philosophy Goodkind puts forth in the conclusion of Faith of the Fallen.I can understand appreciating Rand's philosophy. However, appreciating to the point of putting it in a fantasy novel and passing it off as your own creation can only be called plagiarism.The plot of Faith of the Fallen was excellent, but I found myself disgusted with Goodkind's blatant replication of Ayn Rand's ideas."
2,"I like(d) this Series, and I liked Ayn Rand...","...when I first read her books back in high school. There is certainly a lot of value in what she wrote, as it's thought-provoking and interesting.The Sword of Truth series, however, is something that I indulge for entirely different reasons, and as entertainment this installment falls flat on its face. Goodkind leaves out interesting subplots and characters whose fates were totally unresolved at the end of the previous book so that he can hammer home his Objectivist points. I have philosophic consonance with those points, but don't buy his books to hear them rehashed. If I really wanted that, I'd pick my copy of Atlas Shrugged back up and read it again. Heck, he even named Nicci's father ""Howard"". How obvious is that?"
1,"Ok, but . . .","After reading the first 5 books of the series I was a bit disappointed with this one. Faith of the Fallen is certainly as well written as the other books of the series, but the plot seems a bit ""small"". It's as if you keep expecting there to be much more to the plot, as the whole book seems but an aside to what was left hanging in other books, particularly Temple of the Winds.Still a good book, but doesn't really seem to advance the plot of the ""world"" as the other books did."
3,not the best of the series,"Goodkind spins the same tale as always, and I am getting bored of Richard and Kahlan. However, Goodkind's grasp of suspense kept me reading until the end.I like Goodkind's use of the Old World politics and the way that it reflects on governments of our world. It made me think about social policy, and especially the merits/demerits of extreme socialism."
4,Anxiously awaiting the next one....,"While it is true that this installment does use some stale storylines, (some elements are familar) it is still worth the read. Enjoyable as a stand alone novel, or as part of the series. I have read all, and I've enjoyed every one. Looking forward to the next in the series."
3,"Decent book, not great","I found this book to be reasonably well written. However the plot developement really wasn't what I was looking for. The characters added weren't too terribly interesting and it could have been written much better. Overall, still worth a read."
4,Faith of the Fallen,"Goodkind has done a great job on this book. I did not expect much out of this book because of how bad Soul of the Fire was, but this one is definitely a great write. Buy the book it is well worth the money."
3,Okay... but not great,The first book was genius. The second book was nearly as good. And then it all went downhill. There's only so many times you can use the same storyline with different settings. Also (this made me laugh) the book seems to just be an excuse for the author to rant against two things he apparently dislikes--Organized Religion and Communism. Oh well. I enjoyed it. It was an easy read. Does anyone else out there have a strange misprint in theirs where Chapter's 33-37 are printed twice? I might just have a collector's item if no one else out there has a strange mutation like this...
3,The main failing...,"All sci-fi fans are aware of the fatal flaw that seems to dog these oh-so-promising authors. THEY NEVER GET TO THE POINT! The story seems (at some points) to meander aimlessly as though the author is merely using the novel as a sounding board for his socio-political theories. Despite the rambling style Goodkind has chosen to adopt in the Richard/Kahlan saga, I must admit that I do enjoy the stories and Faith of the Fallen is a great deal more interesting than the its dire predecessor Soul of Fire. Richard is the man many wish they were and you have to admire his immense ability for 'goodness'. Goodkind is not always convincing and there's a lot less magic (the reason for this is evident) and your not always convinced by the characters motives but then I guess if realism was my thing, I wouldn't be reading Terry Goodkind in the first place right?!"
1,"Still ripping off Rand, just a different one now","If you've gotten over Goodkind's incompetent and slavish copying of Robert Jordan's literary style and still want to read his books, do yourself a favor and SKIP THIS ONE. Goodkind spends hundreds of pages reciting the plot of Ayn Rand's THE FOUNTAINHEAD, slamming Rand's totalitarian ideals against strawman political after strawman political. Utter drivel."
1,disappointed again,It appears that this series is going the way of many fantasy series and that Mr Goodkind has once again made the fatal flaw of many a fantasy writer - it is important to finish a series before the series becomes boring. Having read all the books and been entertained by the earlier books I was disappointed by the content and the style of Faith of the Fallen. I think my feelings can be summed up a section which suggested that Richard and Kahlan had only met a year ago - it felt reading this book that we had suffered each minute with them. The book accurately reflects torture by a Mord Sith.
1,They can get away with it.,"Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan are writing worse and worse books, and we are willing to accept them. I find myself continually buying these books with the hope that the next one will be better and continually being disappointed. I think each of them had about 3 good books in them, but instead of stopping decided to keep up the cash flow and see exactly what they could get away with. This book is the stupidest yet. TG seems unable to develop the characters' personalities. We have mild insight into 2 characters this book. Richard and Kahlen do not grow as people. They are no longer endearing. They are beginning to come across as arrogant and petty, where they once were sweet and their relationship was mildly refreshing. If you want to read a good series read George R. R. Martin."
1,Hail to the new Piers Anthony,"Faith of the Fallen has to have been Goodkind's worst book. I have been a fan since the first one, although I was disappointed in the last one, and bought this one eagerly. A waste of trees and my time is all I can say for this book. Let me see, how can you describe what he is talking about other than to see him describe his idea of communism? How many times are we going to go through the same ""Richard is captured and lives as a slave, only to charm everyone around him including his captor""? On top of it all, he takes 539 pages to show everyone what he already knew? Piers Anthony died a cold death because of how he ruined his series. Goodkind is on his way to following that fate. I just wish 1) I had my money back, and 2) I had my time back. I could have been playing a Squaresoft videogame - they have more imagination than this."
4,Well Done,"If people do not completly believe in what their leader is doing than you can not lead them. An excellent book. I was really drawn into this book once I started reading it. I found myself getting worked up over what was happening and realizing the truth of it in reality as to what ""they"" were going through. He outlined a story and stuck to it, describing it in the most alluring detail. In my opinion, this book only followed the other books in the series by the fact that Richard was caught again, though this time as with the others the method of capture, story line, and plot were completely different. I see no flaws in the story, whether the characters or the battles. This is truly one of the best series I've read. I hope it continues until I find something better."
2,Complete utter rehash,"Terry Goodkind has written another episode in his amazingly popular series. And like a tv sitcom, everything happens the same way. Again, we see Richard and Kahlan happily together in the beginning. Then they are forced to separate, again. Richard discovers a wizard's rule, again. No one listens to what Richard says, again. Richard goes through torture, again. Richard refuses to quit, again. Richard's beautiful ""evil"" captor changes her ways and falls in love with him, again. (i don't think this counts as a spoiler).So if you liked everything Terry Goodkind has written before, you'll like this one too. However, if like me you are tired of the lack of originality in fantasy today, this books will be a waste of time.Well, there was one innovative idea, which was to write this book as a propaganda piece. Someone should tell Mr. Goodkind that the Cold War is over and capitalism has triumphed over communism almost everywhere."
2,If you like it the same...........,"This volume continous the story of our brave Richard Cypher, and as some other reviewers already told, it is the same as the last five books.The Good:-Written very vividly.-Something importants happens.The Bad:- The cover already reveils a great deal of the plot (I think)- There is a wise lesson of about 500 pages on Communism in this volume.-----We don't need that! And I hate most that Richard seems to be an All American Guy: How cheap!-New temptation for Richard, New depart from Kahlan, New 'impossible Task'to perform, New foolhardeness', New Magic Rule and a lot more New. But the problem is that it is not new, but it goes on and on and on, each volume, every time the same.The Ugly:Geeeeez, Richard is too close to the Creator: is he immortal?? George R.R. Martin would have killed such a guy a long time before.Anyway, if you read this series you'll probably buy it anyway;'for the always developing story'.................."
3,Richard Rahl meets John Galt and Howard Roark,"This book is very, very different from the previous books in the series. This book has much in common with Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. There are so many parallels I lost count. The story wasn't as engaging as the first three books and wasn't all that original in terms of Richard's moral struggle with the Order (similar to Rand's stuff).I hope that the next book lives up to my expectations, as this one did not."
3,Ayn Rand Rides again!!,"So, I liked the book - it moved well and was well characterized. And it was kind of a nice change of pace.It suffered from the same flaw that Atlas Shrugged suffered from - it was very preachy. I mean, do we really need an anti-communism book?And there wasn't that much in the way of interesting magic - though some large plot twists and some good small ones, too."
5,Goodkind does it again!!!,I just finished reading book 6: Faith of the Fallen and I have to say that this was one of the best if not the best book in the series so far. Very compelling story and I was at the edge of my seat for the last 100 pages or so and couldn't wait to finish it. I wasn't disappointed. Mr. Goodkind knows how to draw you in and really feel for the main characters and their struggles and triumphs. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series. Thanks Terry Goodkind for a very rewarding book to read. I look forward to the possibility of some of these books being turned into an actual movie someday the likes of Lord of the Rings. The TV series is decent but a movie would be awesome.
5,A good read,I thought Faith of the Fallen was a wonderfully written story. I loved the first part that delt with Kahlan's recovery. I especially loved her recount of the struggle she had to regain her will to live. I also loved the battle scenes - Kahlan comes across as a true leader. The character of Nicci was one I came to like as well. Her backstory is interesting and the payoff at the end made the journey worth it. This series continues to impress me. I hope after it is over we will have another chance to revisit some of the characters!
2,Ayn Rand + George Orwell + Sword of Truth = Nothing New,"The absolutely transparent plagerism of ""Atlas Shrugged"" and ""1984"" was so distracting that I found it hard to concentrate on the original material in this book. I've read the whole series, and to say it's getting tedious is an understatement. Every book, Richard discovers a new talent he never had before, a new form of magic, does something of legendary proportions, and gives away more of his empire.It's getting old. Every book starts the same way, something they did in the last book didn't turn out quite right, so they now have a bigger problem than before. Ugh... and book 7 just came out..."
3,Still hooked...,"Richard Rahl is a John Carter of modern times. A super-hero as unbelievable as Superman, almost silly by adult standards. The writing style is light-hearted. The lectures are too long and repetitive, and too many times throughout the whole series I say 'just get on with it!'. But it's easy reading, and it's strangely addicting.In my opinion, this is the weakest book so far. It wouldn't even have rated my 3-stars except that the ending is just as riveting as I have come to expect from the series.If you're looking for a new series to get into, I recommend that you pick up the first two books and read them straight through, and go from there. If you've read the first five books and are wondering if it's worth hanging around, it's probably time to quit. I won't be quitting anytime soon, though!"
3,Not the best of the series but worth reading,"Since english is not my first language I cannot judge the style or the quality of the prose so my opinion goes only to plot and characters. As the title recites, I think FOTF is not the best book of the series, so let's start with the flaws: - same plot lacking originality (Richard and Kahlan parted and then reunited); - author insists too much in providing his vision on economics and society, not that a writer should't do that but Goodkind is too much direct in his opinion and besides depicts a world far too simple - Nicci, though being probably the most intriguing character of FOTW, lacks introspection and her redemption comes too easily and it's not well investigated - the end lacks of credibility and resolves everything in a too simple wayNevertheless FOTW is a good book that has the typical Goodkind's qualities: lots of interesting and not monolithic characters, intriguing plot, good balance between magic and feelings."
2,"A Dissapointing ""Must""","If you are into this series, then like me, you have been waiting a long time for this book. Unfortunately, as much as it is a ""must"" read for us addicts, it is really disappointing and the plot seems to be going very stale. I will not be wasting my time, waiting for his next book in the series. I've had it and feel really let down by Goodkind."
3,Mixed Emotions,"While reading this novel I experienced an odd mix of joy & disappointment.Joy, because, once again I was reading about the adventures of my favorite hero & heroine. Disappointment, because I felt that MORE WORK could have been put into the development of this book. The plot was not fantastic and certainly had nothing new. I was expecting new twists & variations, but no such luck. Having started this series from the very beginning, way back in 1994, I couldn't help but say to myself: ""seen that before..."".I do hope that Mr. Goodkind finds the determination & inspiration to finish this series with a novel that can rival the story that began the Sword of Truth saga: ""Wizards First Rule"". I fervently hope that we finish with a BANG!"
3,Good secondary character,"Nicci saves this book. Richard (the hero) and Kahlan (his wife) are one-dimensional. Richard is noble and self-sacrificing. Kahlan is brave and good. Nicci is evil and well-meaning. She loves pain yet lives to save others. She also kidnaps Richard, drags him away from his wife, and holds Kahlan's life over him like a club. Way to go, Goodkind by developing Nicci."
3,Good but preachy,"Faith of the Fallen is better than the last few installments of this series. Still not up to the standards of the first two, but better. I almost had to force myself to finish Soul of the Fire. I can see now how it fits with the big story, but at the time it seemed a sidebar at best.Goodkind gets unusually ""preachy"" in FotF. It seems every few pages he has a character off on some thinly-veiled diatribe about socialism and welfare. Somehow, as I read the book I kept picturing Goodkind hunkered down in a compound in Montana gleefully asking himself what other political commentary he could pose as fantasy writing and fool the masses. I do also wonder a bit about his psyche as I read the torture elements in each and every story. (kind of interesting coming from a writer named Good/kind, eh?)But still, a good story that at least nudged the overall story a bit further along."
5,Still Can't Stop,I have never read this much before. I can't stop reading this series. It is so good. The rest of the series better keep up with the books I have already read.
1,truthful review,This is simply my opinion and i understand that many blind fanboys will disagree.This is how it goes:If my dog took a turd and that turd had sexual intercourse with a cat and the offspawn from that cat and turd had a retarded cat turd baby and then that horrid baby wrote a book with no knowledge of the english language i can assure you that the retard cat turd baby's book would be much more entertaining then this crap that terry crapkind wrote.
3,Does Richard have ANY flaws!?!,"My god, he seems to somehow get more and more perfect with each book. He's the most powerful wizard; he's the smartest and most insightful character; he's evidently incredibly good looking; his swordsmanship is good enough to kill 30 master swordsman attacking him all at once; every woman and her mother falls in love with him; he's an incredible leader; he gets the most beautiful and unattainable woman in the series; and suddenly we find out that he is a master artist too? What, does he do windows too?This series started out really well, but come on now. A strong and powerful character is all well and good, but when you make them too perfect they stop feeling human, and are thus less interesting.I give this book a rating of 3, but the series as a whole deserves a 5."
1,Goodkind comes down with Jordan's disease,"The Sword of Truth started with such high hopes. I liked the first three, the fourth started the downward slide. The fifth left a lot to be desired and this one...the 6th is a total waste of time and money. Goodkind has now joined the Robert Jordan club of has-been writers. Both started with great ideas, then through greed kept churning out mediocre and then awful novels. Jordan's Rand and Goodkind's Richard started out such strong and interesting characters and evolved to the point that I no longer care what happens to them. Both also started their series with interesting and strong female characters. All of the surviving women in the Wheel of Time series became comical caricatures and Goodkind's Kahlan is fast joining that group. There should be a Writers' First Rule...no epic can go beyond 3 volumes. Philosophers should write philosophy and fantasy writers should write fantasy...the two don't mix. At least not for Goodkind."
1,Arrrgh!,"How much do I have to take this? The series are getting worse and worse! And this book like the last one is a piece of junk. Don't we dezerve something other than a stupid presentation of the communism and capitalism? No we don't dezerve! We dezerve this book where there's nothing itneresting. I doubt that Goodkind will become better in his next books like Jordan - from 7 to 8 not so good, but book 9 was great. And I doubt that ""Pillars of the Creation"" will be better than this junk, but who knows maybe it's even worse!"
5,Completely redeems the series,"To be honest, I was extremely disappointed by the ending of Soul of the Fire. It seemed as if Richard and Kahlan were giving up, and the story didn't seem to be complete. Faith of the Fallen turned my disappointment into elation. It not only stands as a great work by itself, it also turns the end of Soul of the Fire into something brilliant. If you are a follower of this series, please don't let Soul of the Fire make you give up. If you aren't a follower of the series, read it, just so you can experience this book."
4,Pleasureable Read,"First, let me say that Goodkind is an incredible writer and one of my favorites. With that said, let me say that FOTF is not on par with Wizard's First Rule or Stone of Tears. As always, Richard and Kahlan are vivid, well-drawn characters, and the story line and world building are some of the best in the field. Goodkind has a way of transporting the reader into the story and making the reader experience along side of the characters. The continuing story of The Order's progression into the New World is fascinating, and several of the battle scenes are gripping. Unfortunately, the wrap-up is too rushed and contrived, and the storyline is a basic rehash of what Goodkind has written before. Will I continue to spend my hard earned money on the next Sword of Truth book in hardback. Most likely, but I am really looking forward to Goodkind producing the type of book he did early on in the series: fresh, exciting, and compelling."
2,"not as bad as the last two, but...","If you survived to reach this book, you might allready know that each book where Richard and Khalan are togather, the book is bad and when they are seperated the book is good.The good news is that most of the book they are not togather, so it's not as bad as the fourth and fifth, The bad news thought, are that the idie of the book seems to be taken out of a fanatic anti comunist book from the cold war.Don't belive me? don't say I didn't warn you..."
2,Same as it ever was.,"If you have been reading this series, then you know the story. Boy loves girl, boy loses girl, boy gets tortured, girl cries alot and kills people, against all odds they find a way to each other in the end. Come on!!! This is what book 20 or something, and has the same structure to every book. If you have read the other books than this one will be absolutely predictable. The more deliberate interjection of politics into Goodkinds writing is becoming loathsome. We get it already, controlling people is bad, freedom is better, now get on with the story. The only difference between this book and the others, is that Richard doesnt save the day with some great magic that is never explained. Istead he saves the day with... are you ready... A CARVING!! UGGGHHH!"
1,A Big Disapointment.,The first books of the series were good. I read them because they were very interesting with lots of action and surprises.The Faith of the Fallen was very dull though. I had to force myself to finish reading it. The first couple of chapters were good until Richard was captured by Nicci who took him to the Old World. Here the book really gets worse and worse. Basically Richard travels with Nicci through the Old World and this goes on and on and on. Nothing major happens. They just struggle with daily life in the Old World rein under the Order.In my opinion Terry Goodkind suffered from lack of imagination while writing this book. He published it capitalizing on previous excellent books from the series. I'm not sure if I ever read another new book from the series. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.
3,Did Ayn Rand write this for him?,"This book makes me wonder if Terry read Atlas Shrugged and the Fountainhead (and maybe We the Living for good measure) for the first time before starting it. While kahlan's bits are still his normal style, the whole thing with Richard and Nicci in the Old World was like reading Rand's books all over again. Hank Rearden's mother is reborn in Nicci's mother, and Nicci herself... all the most unpleasant characters in Rand's novel are reborn in Faith of the Fallen, and Richard has suddenly become an amalgamation of Hank Rearden, Francisco d'Anconia, Jon Galt, and Howard Roark.Thankfully, Kahlan only channels Dagny/Dominique on occasion.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Atlas Shrugged for what it was... and I can see that the plot needed a bit of what it had... but Terry lays it on somewhat clumsily, with a very thick trowel. Maybe he should have hired Richard to edit, instead of one of the old world carving folks who ""needed the work""."
2,It was OK,"I find that I have become addicted to reading the Sword of Truth series. I love the books and once I start reading them, I cannot stop. However I did find that I skipped large chunks of paragraphs while I was reading this particular volume of the series. Apparently repeating the same message over and over again despite the fact that it is the same message that has resounded throughtout the entire series was how he choose to fill the pages. For those who are considering reading this volume, I would save your money. You won't miss much of the story line."
4,Surprised,"This was the first Goodkind's book I've read. I bought it by chance, expecting yet another sword'n'sourcery flick. To be fair, there is plenty of that, but in fact one can safely call this book a Manifest Of The Libertarian Party Of United States Of America. It does way better job of propagating ideas of Objectivism than the Ain Rand's books, particularly among the youths. As such this book has great value, I believe.Being completely different, I find interesting parallels in the books of another Terry - Terry Pratchett. Objectivism, even in disguise, seems to be very popular among Terries of the world. :-)"
2,Same Old Whine...,"Goodkind's books are beginning to read like Danielle Steel novels--same old story, different dust jacket. Again, Richard is spirited away against his will, this time by the Dark Sister, Nicci. Again, Kahlan the Mother Confessor is used as leverage to ensure his good behavior. (At this point, readers will think, ""Kahlan really needs to jump off a cliff, we're sick of her!"") The story plods along as Richard's innate goodness is the catalyst that inspires the downtrodden to rebel. Can Goodkind stretch this storyline any thinner? One good thing about this book, it is slightly more readable than the last book in the series!"
5,One of Goodkind's best!!!!!!,"I have been a fan of Terry Goodkind from the very begining. His magical world emits so much emotion and realism at the same time that you could almost believe it to be real. Though I was slightly Let down with Soul of the Fire, I believe that Mr. Goodkind has truely made up for any previous shortcommings. The book was absolutly beautiful in it's portrail of humanity's most precious gift--life. I would recommend this book to any one who loves fantasy and believes in the nobilty of the human spirit. It was a truely inspring book. Well done Mr. Goodkind, Well done."
4,Very Enjoyable,"For all of you ""critics"" out their who want to bash this (and other) books because it's a 6th book, or the characters are not developing anymore, or because it may be a little formulaic in parts, this what I have to say....GET OVER IT. Read this book for what it is, and that is a fun fantasy novel.Ok, this book may not be a ""masterpiece of modern literature"" but what the hell....it's an enjoyable book. That's what counts. The story is fun, and fantastical. Maybe it is a little cliche or formulaic in parts, but who cares when it's enjoyable to read and you care about the characters.I give this only 4 stars, because 5 should be saved for those aforementioned ""masterpieces of modern literature""Here's hoping that we don't have to wait another year for the next one (I know, keep wishing)."
1,Bad. Just Bad.,"This book was one of the worst written fantasy books I have made the mistake of paying money for. The plot is nothing more than a poorly-conceived stab at political commentary, and I think having teeth pulled is more fun than wading through it. What a terribly disappointing installment in a series that started out brilliantly, then went downhill from there. If you want to read a real fantasy author, try George R.R Martin, and leave Goodkind behind."
1,A Complete Travesty,"You know, there's a real problem with this rating system: You can't give a book 0 stars. If I could I would. Faith of the Fallen is a strong candidate for the worst book I've ever read. To state all the problems would take well over 1,000 words. So I'll put it like this: If you like books that preach the same message eleventeen times, that are clearly bigoted and closed minded, that have completely one dimensional characters, and that have literaly no climax this book is for you."
4,"MUCH better than the last two, as good as the first.","This book has the series back on track (at last). I thought the series, while still better than average, had deteriorated from the lofty excellence in the first two books. This one is right up there. The preachiness of the message did not detract from the tight storyline or great characterizations."
4,"Great book, but let us get to the end","I have been a fan of Goodkind's work ever since my freind gave me a copy of A Wizards First Rule. All these books keep the intensity and the conclsion comes in the last 40 pages of the books. I think that the only reason that i did not give this book the five stars is that it is about time that Richard makes some headway with his character. I mean that the series needs to end with a bang. I am getting tired of Richard getting beat, when it is obvious the most powerful being in the world. Terry, if you read this, please let Richard go and defeat evil in the last book."
2,Get The Book,"This is far from Goodkinds' best work. The writing is stilted, repetitive and full of political message. The narrator sounds like he is reading The Three Bears to a pre-schooler. I stuck through the whole unabridged thing from a fondness for the characters and the previous books. Would be much better to get the book so you can skip over the anti-communist/socialist message."
4,"Another great book, but what else do we expect.","I started reading this book and felt, Oh No, here we go again. Same dang plot we've seen before. But because I have enjoyed this series immensly, I kept reading and WOW did I change my mind about this book. Terry Goodkind turned me from immense hatred of Nicci to immense pity. This book is an emotional powder keg. Yes, we have seen this before, Kahlan leading a smaller army against incredible odds, Richard being taken from her to far land. HE SUCCEEDS at this. Some reviews complained this story is not moving. HOW WRONG can they be?!?!?!?! This book was great."
3,Tribute or ripoff?,"First of all I think it's a great story and I really have enjoyed all of the books in this series. My problem is this: There are so many obvious parallels between this book and Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, I can't decided if Mr. Goodkind is actually paying tribute to Ms. Rand, or if he's just stealing her ideas....I'm inclined to think it's the latter because there are also many similarities to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.Terry Goodkind's obviously a talented writer and a great storyteller. I just wish he write something of his own."
4,"Risky for Terry, but excellent anyway","After the last two books I was reading just to see how it turned out. I felt that terry had gotten bored with his characters, which made it boring for the reader. I was surprized that I loved this book, It was refreshing right when I was starting to get really bored with the same old stuff. Mr. Goodkind could have included a couple more windows on what our favorite lead characters were up to, (this seems to have upset quite a few of his readers) but overall I enjoyed the change. If you hate change, even change for the good then you will hate this instalment in the series."
4,Goodkind back on track,"I think that the first two books in this series are still far and away the best. In the past couple novels Goodkind has gotten away from the characters and the story line , but in Faith of the Fallen he returns.He stays away from the Kahlan and Richard love affair, which at times is sickening, and he concentrates more on developing the plot and the storyline. I rather enjoyed the symbolism and the objectivism that Goodkind has portryaed in this novel. I wonder if he has any inklings towards Ann Rynd.He has developed good characters and he has a talent for developing tension at very preceise moments, when you aren't expecting it. He is also finally becoming comfortable enought to lay waste to some of the mainstream characters which I think is a wonderful thing to do. It shows that he is not afraid to create more characters when these become boring.I cant wait for the next text out this year.RECOMMENDATION: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
1,The Cure to Terry's tax bill. . .,"You would think that in the year 2000, ten years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and about 25 years since any successful form of state socialism existed, Terry Goodkind would not need to spend his entire book derailing collectivism, socialism, liberalism and the Bismarkian social compact.I can only guess that Terry's tax bill was a bit high from the success of his usually great Sword of Truth books. Well Terry, this rediculous diatribe in the form of a fantasy novel is the cure for next year's tax bill. I, for one, am not coming back for more.We do not need a fantasy counterpart to Ayn Rand.I believe in helping others!"
2,Thinly veiled Ayn Rand book.,"I don't know... this might be my last Goodkind read. It felt like he read a bunch of Ayn Rand, or maybe just some Objectivist philosophy, and said ""Hey! I can write that!"" Because that's pretty much what this book is. Not that there's anything wrong with that, really. I mean, I'm a big fan of The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged. But it felt to me like he really wanted to write a book with that theme, then had to try to figure out how to wedge his characters into the scenario that would let them do that.So I guess I found that part kind of disappointing. It seems like the fairly rich potential Goodkind's characters started with is being squandered at the sake of a message. I understand the logic, but the result, for me, falls flat. Oh well. At least it was a fairly quick read."
2,Typical Goodkind,"As we've come to expect from Goodkind, dear old Richard can do anything and everything... and do it better than anyone else.Kahlan was developed a bit in the book, showing her flaws and frailities. In others, being human.Goodkind beat us over the head again with the Communism Is Bad(tm) stick.I always feel robbed after reading one of these books.. Goodkind tantilizes us with intriguing villains, but fails to follow through with them. Same head true in this book with Nicci, Jagang, and Narev. Why is Narev such a zealot, Jagang so polar, Nicci so dispassionate?? The author just glosses over these aspects of the characters."
3,"Love Goodkind, but.......","I have read all of Goodkind's books from the first and I have to say that they were all fantastic, execpt this one. While I fully understand the plot behind this, I think it could have been portrayed a little differently. It was most definelty like re-reading Stone of Tears with a new twist, Richard is abducted, Khalan leads a small army against a larger one, they get reunited and live happily ever after, until the next book. This book seemed to be missing something, I found myself skipping over pages of boring Imperial Order philosophy and Nicci's childhood(which was mostly unnessary, I picked up on everything i skipped just by reading the rest), in search of the meat of the story. It seemed to me that this book needed to develope some new characters, and kill off more of the old ones. It just seemed to be stagnant as far as that went.I recommend this book to those who are fans of Goodkind, but I just thought you should know what you're in for."
3,"It's good, but wait for paperback. DON'T buy the audiotape!","There is a lot of good to say about this book, and many of the other reviewers have said it. But, Mr. Goodkind needs an editor that will cut some of the things he says over and over and OVER. If you read the book, you can skim over some of the nonsense of ""man's duty to the less fortunate"". When you listen to the tape, you're kind of stuck. At one point, I felt if I heard one more word about ""duty"", I was going to throw all 20 tapes out on to the freeway. Also, I'm getting very tired of a series about magic where no one can ever USE their magic. Listening to a duck quacking would have been better than book 5. This one is not bad, though. But if there is a book 7, can someone PLEASE use a little magic????"
3,Give us more of what we want...,"While this book was fairly entertaining it left me somewhat dissapointed. I, like many other fantasy junkies, love larger than life characters who overcome the odds by their prodigeous skills and courage. Goodkind's latest left me wondering whether he still has the same vision for his characters. Example, Kahlan beats Richard in a mock sword fight? What!?!?! Isn't this the same guy who defeated all those blademasters earning the title ""bringer of death""? Also, Richard STILL doesn't know how to use his magic. After 6 FAT books he ought to know at least something about how to use it.Anyway, I realize that this review might sound a little jaded and might be taken as a warning not to read the book. Not so. Read it and find out for yourself. My suggestion to Mr. Good kind... Give us the original Richard back. Not the OVERLY esoteric and moody Richard who for some odd reason seems to be and expert in Philosophy. I still don't get that."
4,I have faith for the fallen,"It took about 250 pages for me to really get into it and then everything happened so quickly. Important characters died, over a year goes by, the end. Characters who I felt could/should of been in the book were not (ie Chase and Rachel). All in all, it was better then the Souls of Fire, but not as good as the first 4. If the next book shows the same improvement that this one had, it should be of the same quality as before."
2,Anotjer rehash...,"I'll admit that I really enjoyed the first two novels of this series, but in my honest opinion, Kaylan needs to be killed off. All she ever does is betray Richard, doesn't listen to him and basically is a spoiled woman. I mean, how many times is she gonna feel that Richard is cheating on her? How many characters are going to be so stupid and dense (Nicci in the revelation scene about Richards doings in the Old World). Come on , Terry, bring back the old excitement. I'm not going to buy the next book, I think I'll just get it fromt he library. I truly believe Terry has no idea how to end this story. Each book is just a retelling of the previous one, with a few differences. Even the characters are the same., No development what so ever."
1,JUST AWFUL,"I can only liken the people who praise a book like this to the mindless brainwashed people in Wizard's First Rule who were slaves to Darken Rahl. The writing is pedantic, the plot is a rehash of earlier SOT books [how many times is Richard going to be captured and tortured, for pity sake? How many times is Kahlan going to betray him?] and Ayn Rand's vastly better work. I am sick of buying books that wrap right wing political theories in the guise of fantasy. ICK."
5,I Love this Book,"I have read all of the Terry Goodkind series and I must say: ""I love it."" Goodkind's character development and interesting storylines keep me reading all night. This book was no exception. I would say this is the second best book of the series. Though this book doesn't advance the story greatly the interesting insights into the minds of the characters and the great ending make this a great book that I would certainly recommend as either a standalone reader or read with the whole series."
5,The Spirit of Reiki: From Tradition to the Present,"An excellent reference book for Reiki practitioners. Very well documented and researched. I highly recommend this book to anyone serious about Reiki, and for those who are interested in learning more about Reiki."
4,Foundational,"If you studied Reiki in the US, you most likely have the ""story"" that was attached to it that has a lot of controversy and little proof. This brings you the REAL story, and the proof alongside of the history of Reiki, it's origins as well as how it morphed into what it is in the west. I found this book very informative and helpful in separating truth from fiction. It's helpful for my clients as well, to know that it really has a valid origin."
4,The Spirit of Reiki,"A great book for anyone who wants to learn more about Reiki. The book covers the way Reiki interacts with Chakras, meridians and other spiritual beliefs and practices. Detail on the history of Reiki is really interesting and dispels a few myths. The book explains the many levels Reiki works on and how Reiki works. Recommended for the beginner and experienced channel who want to learn more about Reiki."
4,nuts and bolts of reiki,"Excellent source of information on reiki and reiki techniques. Doesn't just go over the origins and symbols, but creatively includes many treatments previously not mentioned in other manuals on the subject."
3,Run of the Mill,"This is just like so many other books on forensic sciences. The real interesting reading is Dr. Baden's first book, ""Unnatural Death."" This isn't a bad book, as Dr. Baden has had a very interesting career, it's just not the fascinating stories he's told before. In fact, most of the book is about his colleagues."
5,VERY COMPELLING!!!,"THE INSIGHT OF DR. BADEN, COUPLED WITH HIS UNIQUE EXPIRIENCES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE SUBJECT MAKE THIS BOOK A MUST READ. VERY COMPELLING STUFF.JAMES CADY"
4,Fascinating overview of the forensic science community.,"The authors of this book were not looking to write an in-depth, step-by-step list of how to determine cause of death, but more of an overall glance at forensic science in recent years; who the major players are, what the current technology is and what it can do; and what forensic science should and should not be.In this sense they did an excellent job. They mention several recent big-name cases, such as the OJ case, and lesser-known but just as interesting cases, many involving death row. It does tend to drag in some parts where details are given, but those details for the most part end up being relevant to understanding the overall case.All in all, it's an excellent book for what it wants to cover, though if you are looking to find out a definition and to-do list for forensic science, this isn't the book for you."
2,Just downright BORING!,"I was a huge fan of Dr. Baden's HBO series on crime and forensic pathology, so it was with eager anitcipation I waited for this book. Once I received and read it I was dumbfounded. The chapters contain very little that is interesting, or better yet, entertaining. Overall, many, many references and indictments of the poor job done by the LAPD in the OJ trial! It's everywhere in the book!!! Over and over he harps on it. Not much more tothis book than a soapbox for him to complain about OJ, and bland stories of other experts in the field."
4,Great Book for Future Medical Examinors,"I am very glad to have received this book. It has allowed me to get closer to the idea of becomming a medical examinor. This book brings up many great questions and ""rules to live by"" for forensic pathologists. I like this book because of my personal interests in my future career but feel it would be enjoyable to others also. My overall impression is, it is a great book, and is very well written, it does drag on at times but is definitly worth it."
5,Precise and Accurate account of forensic methods,"I have no problem recommending Dr. Baden's books to anyone with an interest in the forensic sciences, as someone who works in the field, I find it refreshing when someone with his experience can relate his work to both the casual and informed reader. He is descriptive in a way that easy to understand and not boring. The book is great and it was hard to put down."

3,I love the fragrance,"This eye cream smells great, just like a spa treatment. It moisturizes nicely too, but the price was a bit steep. I have not seen it ""wipeout"" anything unfortunatley."
2,still have dark circles,It is an ok eye cream. The main reason I got this was to help get rid of my dark circles around my eyes and unfortunately I still have them.
3,Okay,"This is a great company with some great products, but we did not notice any difference using this eye cream."
2,This is not Original,"This book here is not original, it is a false re-wording of Divine Healing of Mind and Body [Paperback] byMurdo MacDonald- Bayne , the anonymous writer, whoever that is, did a bad job of trying to destroy a good work by adding his/own prejudice to it...The Original book Divine Healing of Mind and Body By Murdo MacDonald- Bayne was a book written to all humanity without prejudice and not written to anyone in particular and not even to christians but this anonymous writer of this book is a a very prejudiced writer,a christian who turned a global work into a limited work... turning another man's work into his own and that is the main reason they couldn't show their name....http://www.amazon.co.uk/Divine-Healing-Murdo-MacDonald--Bayne/dp/0852073321/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid;=1318121491&sr;=8-7"

I can open the sound and picture files individually, but I cannot launch the program. There is a version 2.0 available that you may want to try instead, but unless you're running Windows 95, I don't think this is going to work for you."
3,A little large for a netbook,"I bought this bag to carry my netbook and a few accessories. It is well padded and I was actually able to carry my netbook, headphones, car charger, wall charger, a 24-dvd case and a book all without making it even look full. So, for travel it worked great. I would, however, hesitate to buy this if you were looking for something sleek to just carry your netbook in. I'm sure there's better alternatives out there..."

2,"Nice, not great.","Just got the watch. Nice looking, but there are design flaws.The LCD screen is very dim. Little contrast. Hard to see in daylight, very hard in dim light.The LCD back-light is pathetic. Barely helps at all even in complete darkness.The crown to set the time of the analog display is too touchey and too easy to pull out. Pulling it out resets the LCD and turns the analog watch off.Too many silly flaws. I would not buy it again."
3,Great Grappelli...,"But the audio is atrocious! The mic job on this recording was hideous. The music is wonderful, as usual but the sound level is on the floor."
5,Highest quality.,"Wow, this thing is heavy-duty! Easy to install, with numerous holes to mount it into the cabinet. I think it will last longer than the house!Only complaint - the mounting screws were too long and came out the bottom of the shelf. Had to find shorter ones."
1,no psych book ever received.,"Still waiting for psych book. All books arrived except this one, so I can't rate it. I prefer the book vs a refund."
1,This is not the book you are looking for.,"Despite what the title says, this is the study guide, not the actual book. I hear the book is great, but now I guess I'll have to go buy it from the bookstore instead. Amazon fail."
1,Not what i expected.,"This book was not what i expected. It was described to be in very good condition, but there was heavy highlighting and handwriting. This did not interfere with me getting my work done however i believe that it was overpriced for the condition it was in. This book should have been priced at about $20-$25 and no more."
3,Should have called this a steak knife,I ordered some of these that were 4 for 3 on sale (70%+ off) knives for Scout Camp. The blade design does not appeal to me and the blade is thin like a fillet knife. But the handle is nice and they would work well as steak knives. Arrived sharp.
5,Great braking bite right out of the box,"I was not satisfied with my OEM brake pads on my 2005 Honda Odyssey, or the replacement Duralast Golds that I purchased from Autozone. My wife drives the van and transports my kids, so I wanted better and more reliable braking performance. I performed a lot of on-line research before buying these Akebono pads (purchased front and rear set separately), and it paid off. I have done quite a few brake jobs in my time, and I have never had a set of pads seat so quickly and ramp up to full bite within a short drive. Braking is good, wet or dry, and the pads appear to be wearing well. I expect 60,000 miles or more before the next pad replacement. As a bonus, the Akebono pads actually do produce less brake dust, as advertised, and the dust is light in color. Honda ought to use these pads as OEM."
4,Good system,"Overall, I like this product. Sounds good, a breeze to set up, and at the price I got it at, I couldn't go wrong. Good starter or second system."
4,Almost excellent...,"Overall, I'm very happy with this system. The setup is easy, and it sounds great. It does a nice job of upconverting my normal DVDs to my Sony Bravia television. That being said, there are a couple negatives:1. No HDMI in... so unless you run this through an HDMI switcher, if you only have one HDMI in on your TV, you're screwed! I have a PS3 and this system, and they don't play nice together.2. The speakers are nice, but they all have a custom plug on the end that goes into the theatre system. So unless you get new wires, or cut these custom ends off yourself, the speakers won't plug into other receivers.Overall, this is a very nice system, especially for those of you who aren't very tech savvy. And the speakers put out nice sound, and match with my Sony Bravia TV. But if you really want to get your HD devices to play nice together, you need to buy a receiver with at least 3 HDMI in and 1 HDMI out."
4,A very good starter home theater,"I bought this for my small one bed room apartment and 32"" tv. I can say that I'm impressed by the overall quality of the speakers and sub. The set up was painless and easy. There was a lot of included speaker wires that was more than enough for the satellite speakers. The included little microphone was fantastic. Just make sure that you have the cables ready. I had to get a set of audio cable to hook up TV out to the receiver and a HDMI cable to connect the receiver to the TV. There is only one rolled up video/audio input so using it as a true receiver for many devices is painful (unless you get an expensive source switch). The quality of the DVD player is sub par. I mean it's pretty good playing DVDs but it doesn't support USB media or Divx. Overall and excellent set that doesn't look cheap and a great starter set for some one who really wants the surround sound experince."
5,THE BEST,I bought the Sony Bravia-DAV-HDX500 Theatre System from Amazon because they had the best price.This system is nice. The sound is excellent and the set was easy. Cords are color coded. Instructions are easy to follow. They even provide a Quick Setup. I would recommend buying this system from Amazon.
3,"sounds great, but ...","The system sounds great. The sound fills the room, but the setup is too complicated. The instruction book is thick, hard to read, and full of technical stuff. I'm using this with a Sony Bravia HD TV, a Dish satellite HD DVR, and a Panasonic VCR/DVD, and I'm still trying to figure it all out. I like the sound very much. I use it every day, but using it can be difficult."
4,Alternative Country?,"Producer Gil Charron has gone beyond the present limits set by the Country Music industry with this one, producing a sometimes Classical, sometimes Jazz, and definitely underground Country style to Paul Henry Dallaire's haunting lyrics.I found it quite original and fresh, and truly enjoyed it!Kind of like Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen all in the same melee, with a new age ambience..."
1,Exceptional work-out routine! VHS copy badly degraded.,"I purchased the VHS (not available in digital). It was greatly degraded and bearly watchable. I threw it out. I wish there were a digital remaster of thisclassic work-out program. VHS only cost a couple of bucks. But, I guess you get what you pay for :("
4,Nice set,"These candies are a treat for toffee lovers. You'll find some not quite wrapped in the individual tins, but they still taste very good. They are a public candy dish award winner!"
1,Mokery of Whitch Craft,"This book is what i call a fun book. It has no real spells to cast as it says. If you are looking for a book, keep loking."
2,Its not to good.... A little fake i would say,"This book is not what I would call a good book, it is not something I would consider on getting from the title, (spells and such). I am a Wiccan and also a practitioner of magick, this is not really what it is like"
4,Belkin ST-LC Fiber Patch- One ST Was Quite Tight,"Package arrived quickly with no issues. The cable itself looked to be in excellent condition, however when I went to connect it to my fiber patch panel, one of the STs would stick, but no twist. It worked fine because it was a tight enough fit to where the ""twist"" and lock wasn't needed, but not quite what I'd expected. Other than that, no complaints."
5,Great reporting but painful to read,"This book was very well written but some chapters were too painful to read through especially when these freaks were irradiating prisoners' gonads. I can't understand why anyone would ever trust the military after reading about MKULTRA, Operation Northwoods, JFK and the Plutonium Files yet I see they are still one of the most trusted institutions in our government. These guys (by this I mean the Joint Chiefs, CIA and other black op wizards are sick and paranoid and they yield way too much power with unlimited budgets they think they can do anything to anybody and they do."
4,c. peace rated by me,"My feelings about Paul Pickerings fable,""Charlie Peace"".To make it short and to the point,Paul Pickering makes this a somewhat depressing but exhellirating story of a modern day mistaken identy of a man thought to be Jesus A. Christ.And if the son of God were to return how we as,less than prefect humans would more than likely crucify his ass a second time.A great thought jerker!"
2,Jones on Skid Row,"Three years in the making and not exactly a robust sounding Jones, it still has it's moments. For completists only."
2,soul searching,This book wasn't what I thought it would be. It was full of statistical research and not enough reference to scripture.
5,Review of Soul Searching,"This book is a very interesting and thought provoking look at teenagers and religion in todays society. I was impressed at the variety of the interviews and the responses and how very different and varied teens view spiritual topics. As a Youth Director in a small rural church I feel this was a very eye opening book about how we are falling short as parents, teachers, and church leaders. We have a huge responsibility to the Christian youth who are the future of our churches."
4,One of the best rock records in a long time,"I think the title says it all. This is a band that has some amazing capabilities. I got this CD after hearing the first 2 tracks on the radio, and let me assure you now, the rest of the album is just as good. Starting with #4, the songs start to get a little redundant, and a lot less memorable, so that explains the missing star. Overall, I'd say that the first two tracks are worth the money you'll spend on this CD."
5,best CD 2000,"This is the best disc of 2000 because every song on it is a winner from the opening two track's ""First Time"" and ""Drag You Down"" on through to the amazing intensity of ""Famous"" and the finale ""Stay and Drown"" if you don't have this cd get it now! Just because you will not hear a band like this anywhere in the alt rock scene their combination of emotion and songwriting is unmatched lyrically they are on top of it plus they rock and if you have all four of those elements you are golden in my book. Another excellent track is ""For The Ocean"" with it's breakneck opening to the extrodinary chorus. This bands emotion is for real, believe me it's getting harder and harder to find real rock these days let alone good rock that stands out from the crowd and this cd is more than just a breath of fresh air it may end up being one of the best records you'll ever buy."
3,Deep And Dark,"The album start off with ""First Time"" a great song with an awesome and catchy beat to it. The second song ""Drag You Down"" is in my books the heaviest song soundwise on the record, followed by ""Suffocate"". A very deep and dark album, with a mysterious side to it. If you have a dark side with a mysterious side, pick up this album, you two will get along perfectly. Scott's lyrics are very dark and mysterious. A lot of his words makes me wonder. A lot of people may not know exactly what he's talking about, but that's the cool side of it, it makes you wonder. It's all up to your imagination as to what most of the lyrics are about."
2,"Starts good, then fades","The 1st couple of songs are pretty good, but the CD really drops off after that. Did they run out of good ideas, or are the last 8-10 songs on the album representative of their real sound? Not great."
4,Canadian band's rock,Finger Eleven's The Greyest of Blue Skies is one of the best C.D.'s I purchased this year.Not a bad track on it.The single First Time is one of those never gets old songs that just stick out in your mind as great.If I love so much why 4 instead of 5?Track 2 doesn't seem to fit to me. With all the other tracks it kinda sounds like KoRn or something still one of the best C.D.'s of the year. So far Canadian Rock bands are better than most from the U.S.A. They have the same producer as Our Lady Peace (also Canadian) and are almost as good. If you liked their first disc Tip or vise versa check this out.
4,I love it,"Rich guitar licks, backed by a great singer. Intelligent lyrics, though bogged down by repeativeness every once in awhile. (only downside) Another one of my discs I have bought out of curiosity. I was genuinely pleased. A band that deserves credit for what the've done."
5,Quit Dissin' Finger Eleven,"I was reading these reviews and just had to put my two cents in. Finger Eleven is my absolute favourite band. I noticed that most people don't like Drag You Down and I feel an urge to defend it. I admit that I didn't like it at first (it's definetly heavier than their usual work) but it quickly grew on me. This album is amazing and consistent all the way through. The only thing that might possibly be considered a bit of a let down is My Carousel, which is okay but not up to their standards. Sick of it All would be my favourite song on the album. Anyways just buy the record (and Tip too for that matter) because you'll never find a band that has such amazing songs all the way through. I guarantee you'll love the entire albums and never feel the need to skip past any of the songs."
4,Better than I expected,"If you're one of those people that like to classify music by placing it in a genre with other artists, you won't be able to appreciate this review. The thing is this album does bring reminiscence to Korn or even Our Lady Peace, but that in no way says that it should be likened to their music. Personally, I think this band a greater achievement than Korn for its deviation from swear words, which tend to be used more as an fill-in for creativity than artistic expression. I think the only thing that makes it like OLP is the band's origins, in Canada.But the music here is really a triumph. It has lyrical quality that keeps you interested, and the musical skill is definitely there. Listen to First Time, Carousel, and Walking in my Shoes. You won't be disappointed."
5,Better Than Tip?,"While ""Tip"" most likely introduced the gut crunching band known as Finger Eleven to the world, ""The Greyest of Blue Skies"" tops the great sounds of ""Tip"". It is an emotional rollercoaster, tossing the listener from the more joyous sounds on the CD to the sullen. This is definitely a great buy if you are looking for some good, hard-nosed rock. Some Finger Eleven fans may not notice, but ""Suffocate"" is also on the Scream 3 soundtrack. That song is the whole reason why I bought the damn thing. I normally hate sound tracks, but the Scream 3 features great bands like Powerman 5000 and Creed. Creed has 2 great tunes on it. They are both very well done songs. Getting back to Finger Eleven...they sound so much better on ""GoBS"". There were a few tunes on ""Tip"" that I didn't especially enjoy listening to. Not so with Greyest of Blue Skies. There is not a bad track on this CD...WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!! Pick it UP!"
5,rock amania,This album was amazing in 2001 after hearing first time and drag you down on dbz lord slug and stay and drown on dbz coolers revenge i was like wow i have to get this album and i did it was strong and passionite this album is tottally worth it it was great.
5,Great sophomore album,"Finger Eleven are one of those bands that keep growing on you until you just wish they'd put out a new album every month. ""The Greyest of Blue Skies"", F11's second album, finds them progressing their sound. They get a bit heavier on this album, and still stay very melodic. This is definitely a hard band. They basically stay with mid-tempo rockers...there's no real fast driving songs. ""Drag you Down"" and ""Suffocate"" come the closest. The rest of the album is just heavy guitars, great vocal work, and powerful song writing. The closest comparison I can give to F11 is Our Lady Peace back in their ""Naveed"" days, but with a much heavier guitar. Finger Eleven rocks to say the least, and you won't be disappointed by this album at all. It's melodic and heavy, a combination Finger Eleven work to perfection."
4,OK - you already have an idea what the plot's about -,"so you may be wondering if this book is worth your time.'Beyond Suspicion' is a quick-moving book and is a sequel to Grippando's first published novel 'The Pardon'. I read 'The Pardon' many years ago, but reading the first book is not a necessary requirement - Grippando sets the stage very well in this book so it can be a 'stand alone' novel.I shot through this book very quickly - the plot drags you in pretty well and Grippando's writing style keeps the book moving along at a quick pace. The main character is fairly average and his world is suddenly turned upside down by one case and its connections to the underworld. Murder, mayhem and one family crisis after another keep it interesting. Grippando fills this novel with a multitude on interesting characters, any one of which would be strong enough to be the main character in a book.A good solid read - a great summertime novel."
3,Not a good sequel,"Albeit the theme's book is kind of new, the viatical story with the Russian mob, the book loses itself in overly Miami descriptions. It also makes the love story of the first book ""The Pardon"" a phony one because in this book you'll know that Jessie was distraught since she were nine. So many of the situations in both books were because of Jessie, not because of Jack.If you read this book first than the other one you may like it because of the brisk pacing of the story. But that won't happen if you first read ""The Pardon"""
5,A real Suspense Book,Another Jack Swyteck mystery. James Greppano keeps Jack finding troubleafter trouble in this suspense mystery. It will keep your interest throughtoutthe whole book.
2,X41 - Prepare extra money for a replacement battery,It was very frustrating me that the battery shipped along with this latop lasts only an hour without powersupply. Having contacted to the manufacture and they said this is the way it is.
1,Boring and lacking dimension,"I prefer character-driven fiction and, as such, have enjoyed several of JCO's books. This one, however, was a disappointment. I forced myself to finish it.Most off-putting was the first person narrative. This could have worked OK, however, the dialogue and interaction were ineffectual and too infrequent to balance the over-abundance of introspection. This exposition provided insufficient relief from the seemingly endless narrative and resulted in a character with limited dimension that failed to evoke either empathy or engagement with the reader.I suspect Oates wrote this as an example of first person composition for her students. As an academic exercise, it probably delivered. As a novel, it was a major yawn. Not recommended."
2,Sloppy writing,"An author of Oates' experience and stature should not be so careless. The details of 1963 are wrong. Cans of Tab and Coke on the floor. First of all, there were no cans in 1963. Everything was in bottles, and most required a deposit and were to be returned. Disposable cans didn't arrive until years later. I don't even think ""Tab"" existed in 1963.The maid cleans up and puts trash in her plastic trash bag. Not in 1963 she didn't. There were no plastic trash bags until the 1970's.This kind of sloppiness indicates Oates is writing her formulaic, repetitive books without even thinking them through. If she can't be bothered why should we be bothered to read them?"
1,Ho-Hum.........,"I was looking forward to reading this book based on the plot and the author's reputation, but after reading it I just don't think it was worth it. The character of ""Anellia"" was interesting but tiring. How does someone so intelligent fall in love with a man that is mentally abusive and even physically abusive towards the end? I know she had a bad childhood.....oh I guess that's it....she's emotionally damaged so of course she wouldn't fall in love with a ""normal"" guy. Vernor, her ""lover"" (but there was NO LOVE!) was drawn as a character with a pseudo-intelligence that's masqueraded as a philosophical genius of some sort but as geniuses go, he is a social misfit. Yeah, very compelling (hear my sarcasm?) He was boring and couldn't say much other than endlessly quote philosophers. The sex scenes were without feeling and totally demeaning.The book was short but really, if it went on any longer I would've quit."
3,meloncholy,"You can hear the despiration in this womans story. The want and the need to be accepted, cared for, and loved. But what I liked most about this book was the woman's strength. She refused to let that stop her from fighting for that love. Although she was an outcast who was cast out she fought her way in."
1,Oates uses her powers for evil!,"I haven't read any of her other work. I'm sure the writing is just as beautiful and sensitive as it was in this one (and it was), but how could anyone take such gifts and use them to do things like describe first love as a disease? I felt utterly horrible the whole time I was reading this. It was depressing, without any sort of emotional reward.The character names sounded fake.I'm not saying the book was bad (the star ratings, I noticed, have to do with how much I enjoyed the book), but it takes a certain type of reader to deal with protracted melancholy. There's a certain tension that comes from a character seeing herself in a situation which she finds uncomfortable from day one, and then just staying in it until it ends horribly. This is just fair warning to people who like to actively solve problems."
4,Just Like the International Blend in '81,"Adams Avenue Theater, North Park Lion's Club and Fairmont Carpenter's Hall.This was Mod in the 70's and 80's - all the way in San Diego? Who'd have thunk it? Less than 15 years after the end of the original Mod sound, these kids were turning their backs on the oP shorts and puka shells of the native environment and wearing blue mohair. Digging ""beat"" music...This disc captures what it was like for the ears in those converted spaces and unlicensed cafes - without the miniature roar of Italian scooters!Get this, and anything you can find by the Crawdaddys and Unknowns."
3,A tragic Waste!,"Ok, that may be overstating my point a bit much, but I think we've all come to expect more that a dungeon crawl from Mr. Salvatore. There was a little substance to this one, but so many lengthy battle scenes. Jarlaxle and Entreri have a fascinating dynamic, but that was definitely underemployed in this novel."
5,Finally...what I've been waiting for!,"After much anticipating and hoping that Salvatore would write a book following post-Drizzt Entreri it has come to pass. A wonderful read, even though at times I wonder just how good the editor was as there were more editing mistakes (particularly words out of syntax and what not) than I have seen in any other Salvatore book. Needless to say, I can't wait to see how Entreri and Jarlaxle get out of their next predicament...lol"
1,ugh,If you're interested in reading a dungeons and dragons adventure module in novel form this is for you. If you're interested in a fun read this isn't.Salvatore looks like he is phoning it in this novel. The writing and editing are not very good and plot development is very predicitable. Get this book at the library and don't waste your money.Compared to George Martin Salvatore is minor league.
4,A change of heart,"Although it doesn't contain my favorite character, Drizzt, I did find this book an interesting read. Alas, I didn't read the first book of the series, going directly to the second. But I didn't feel too lost while reading this book. It really makes you rethink your initial feelings towards certain characters. After reading this book, I felt that I actually liked Entreri a bit more -despite his previous actions. We get to see him in a different light - as he learns more about himself. The ending threw me for a loop, although it was a very interesting ending! I can't wait for the next book in the series!"
1,"Not a book, a video game","I like this universe of characters, Salvatore has created (and really liked his first book in this Jarlaxle-Entreri series, ""The Servant of the Shard."" However, this book was terrible. It starts with a scene that could literally be in medias res for a 1980s video game, then continues downhill from here: new characters with no depth or development, no plot, little dialog, etc. Just a series of descriptions of characters navigating video game obstacles (some of them even get a replay).As least I bought this on a Kindle and did not waste any trees."
4,Good guided meditation,I used to listen aeoliah but this cd was different by the way Very good CD and guided meditation I like it
2,"It was okay, but I've read better by this author","While reading this book I felt disappointed in the writing. To me, there was too much background detail and talk about Byron and Nick obviously both wanting the lead character, Miranda. The author also decided to throw in way to many other characters like the agent, the publist, the 2 other girls in the contest, the bodyguard, etc. It was distracting to the story with so many characters in the room trying to talk. The ending was predictable and I wasn't surprised at the end. Some of her other books like ""Silent Stalker"" and ""Someone At The Door"" were a better read."
2,A huge disappointment,"This book might have appeal for people who haven't read any other books by Richie Tankersley Cusick, but as someone who has been a big fan ever since Fatal Secrets back in 1992, I was very disappointed by this book. It definitely wasn't up to her usual standards; the entire element of suspense was simply not there. I'm also disappointed by the fact that this author seems to have dropped off the face of the planet so far as her books are concerned, devoting time to writing up screenplays from Buffy the Vampire Slayer instead of writing her own original books. What ever happened to the book which was supposed to come out after Starstruck?"
3,"""Fascinating Plotlines?!""","Fascinating plotlines are what drive you to read Cusick's work? I don't know about that...while they are wonderfully fluffy ways to spend an afternoon, I have to tell you a secret. They are predictable in their ""deviously"" written plots. There are *always* two love interests of the surprisingly beautiful and strong female lead. The one who protects her the most is always the one she needs to be saved from by the other guy (Mr. Brotherly) at the end of the story. Cutesy fluff, yes. Fun read on a rainy day...yes. But fascinating plotlines? <laughs>"
4,The fire from down South,There banging with real tight beats and rhymes. I'm feeling the fast rapper and what they are doing.
5,Perfect decorator knob for antique finds,It seems like a small purchase but I just painted my powder room black. it's great but i needed a special accent knob and I found it.
3,"not a ""must read"", but enjoyable","This is his first book I have read, so I don't know how it compares to ""Unbearable Ligthness of Being"", but overall I found the book easy to read, and enjoyable. He is good at describing the feelings, and putting into words the emotions of an emigre who is in conflict of going back to his/her mainland. But I found him poor in terms of scheduling the events. Also some of the characters and their meanings are not very well cooked.That's why I give him 3 stars."
2,Sorry for such a low rating,"I am truly sorry for having given such a low rating for this book. But my conscience didn't allow me to give a rating higher than 2 stars. Having gone through 2/3 of the book, I decided that I should not continue my reading. This book did not bring me the excitement I had when I was reading his other magnum opus. This book is about the return of two Czech emigre and what these two people, certainly a man and a woman, encounter on their native land. Kundera, as usually, mixes eroticism in his work. He also employs his usual way of constructing stories: writing about how each of the main characters thinks and feels in each one's own perspectives. But written in French, this book doesn't have the brilliance of his other books...I don't think he truly masters French as well as his own language."
4,Nostalgia,"This short book describes the feelings and perceptions of a Czech that emigrates to France during the communist era who returns to her homeland after many years. It will surely be a delightful read for those living away from their home countries.But the issues are universal: How does human memory work? What is the difference between what we remember and what we would like to remember? How do other people remember us? Are we freed by the future or captured by the past? Aparently simple questions that Kundera magnificantly puts to the readers throught this beautiful novel.I doubt this is Kundera's masterpiece. But it is short, interesting, and enjoyable. Recommended."
4,This Book is a definite must!!,"This is a great book and covers many many areas that are very useful to know as a jazz singer, from phrasing, endings and intros to organising your charts and working with a band, tempos etc. etc. It's definite must!"
4,Really helpful and well-written,"A great resource for people just starting out in jazz vocals. Is written very clearly, without talking down to the reader. I'm a non-musical mom who's helping guide my quite-musical daughter through the college decision/application process, and this book gives us so much to talk about ... it helps me help my daughter ""get"" a song by reviewing the lyrics, while also stressing the importance of musicality.My only complaint is that the standards she chose to highlight didn't really ""speak"" to either my daughter or myself. I didn't really understand why those particular songs were chosen."
2,Three Strikes and You're Out,"Only one CD with music, and that is essentially Rhino's ""Baseball Greatest Hits."" All songs have been previously released on other compilations. Steeerike ONE!Packaging comes in box that looks like a base. Not very clever. Steerike TWO!Overpriced!Steerike THREE!Fans will appreciate nostalgia evoked from listening to radio play-by-play calls, but THREE CDs are filled with radio calls, interviews, etc. Too much! More songs!For baseball music, other options include Diamond Cuts (Vol. I through VIII) and ""Baseball"" documentary soundtrack."
4,BIZZARE ELECTRONIC BASED MUSIC,"Love this album!It's really varied, with my fav tracks being 'The Gabbler' with the crazy rambling stories and the quirky funky ""chorus"", 'So Where did You Hide?' which is a very cool jazzy, funk rock song with a great female vocalist & 'Interest Free' which is a beautiful piece of music with Indian Sitars sampled throughout.The other tracks are just as different from electronic music to funk and jazz - each with their own unique twist."
4,An all-time great romantic crooner.,"This classic album from 1979 is one of Mr. Mathis' best albums of the 1970s. Best known for his breathtakingly beautiful duet with Jane Olivor (""The Last Time I Felt Like This"") and the minor Disco hit ""Gone, Gone, Gone"" this CD offers a truly enjoyable listening experience from beginning to end. Johnny's ultra-smooth renditions of the standards ""As Time Goes By"" and ""Begin The Beguine"" are beyond any reproach whatsoever while the pleading, anguished ballad ""How Can I Make It On My Own?"" is simply one of this album's best-kept secrets. A classic album from one of the 20th century's smootherst and most iconic male vocalists."
1,Probably my mistake,I already have this on cassette tape. I thought I was ordering a CD and did not pay close enough attention that it was actually a cassette tape I was ordering. More angry at myself for not reading more closely. I really like this Mathis recording and wanted it on a CD.
5,Pefect Symmetry,"I got my video some time ago and I have to say Wayne Edwards kicks ...!! He's a real martial arts man that teaches down to Earth techniques with great realism. He does not suggest you try to ""fly"" through the air like stunt men in movies on a rope. His techniques really work. I hear he has quit a history as a bodyguard even though he wont talk much about it and he's pretty darn cute too! It's a great workout, and great self-defense video from a man that in real life would kick most ""martial artists"" ...! He's the real deal. I'll take him against a young Chuck Norris, Segall, Blanks, anybody. Try it for yourself."
2,Readable - but not a must have,"The story of an unexceptional childhood - mild neglect, some poverty and a very filthy home - neither sordid nor tragic nor eventful enough to be compelling reading. Especially for a person raised in India the dysfunctionality level of childhood/family seems average. The only redeeming feature is Lorna Sage's writing style. Witty and insightful. Normally this should raise a book to atleast 3 and a half stars but somehow this one does not quite make it past ""interesting enough to read when there's nothing better to do"". To use review cliches since they work so well in describing a book, it is readable but far short of unputdownable."
5,"Yowtch! This is a hilarious, wicked, killer of a memoir","Holy moly! You wanna talk about a dysfunctional family? Here it is. It's during the years of WWII. The author's father is off fighting for God and country, and her mother is having a delayed adolescence, so author Lorna Sage is shipped to her grandparents house somewhere in rural England. Her grandparents are weird, weird, weird, but it is their very faults that ultimately make Sage, a well-known and powerful literary critic, into the person she becomes.Her grandfather is a debauched, intellectual, furious and infuriating vicar whose idiosyncrasies were seemingly limitless. Her grandmother's rage at her lot in life and the man who was responsible for it (and by extension, ALL men) never once abates - and you almost champion her for her constancy.Bad Blood reads as wicked fun with a strongly feminist underlying message. I loved it."
3,Not too bad. Not too good.,"I purchased, and read this, because I had to for an assignment. It was an easy read but I kept expecting something exciting to happen. Something exciting never came and I was left feeling a little disappointed. However, I did take away from it a little bit of an idea of life in that era and geographical region so it was not a waste of time reading it."
5,Hearing the Classic,"This recording is an awesome presentation of THE ILIAD. Derek Jacobi doesand excellent job. The Iliad is suppose to be heard, not necessarily read. This CD is well worth the price. I listened to half of it on a trip and it was enthralling! jdm"
3,This is a good book.,"The Iliad of Homer was a good book but you have to be interested in reading it. It is very difficult to read, but what I did understand, I thought was very interesting, exciting, and educationial. The book has meaning and power. The hero went overseas to fight in a war and then struggles to make it make it back home to protect his throne and his family.The book is suspenseful and exciting and is a good book if you are into Greek mythology. Although the names and places are hard to pronounce, I give this book three stars for its brilliance."
1,Not Homer,"Yes, it reads easily, but please do not be deceived into thinking you are reading Homer's Iliad. This is Lombardo's Iliad, and he has taken incredible liberties with the original epic. The hard Parryists-- those who would have you believe that everything in Homer is essentially derivative metrical 'filler', thus expendable, may be satisfied with this butchering of the poem, but I would rather let it stand as it has been read and appreciated for the last, oh, going on three thousand years.Lattimore's translation is still the best. It's getting a little old, and may sound a little archaic, but if you want to read what Homer wrote (and don't have years to spend studying Greek), it's the best thing widely available. Read Fitzgerald if you want, or Fagles if you must... but this version is best left on the shelf."
1,GREAT BOOK - AMAZON DELIVERY SUCKS,"Amazon should be ashamed of the confusing and complex methods needed to download this audio book to a simple Kindle.Audio books are large, but the expectation on the wireless system is that it will download in a few moments, not in hours.The secondary download system provided by their other website (why? It makes no sense to have a separate website) is even more user unfriendly.This audio book is excellent and well worth the price.But Amazon should really be ashamed of this atrocious delivery mechanism. Slow, too complex, and no help from customer service. By the way, where is Customer Service on this site - dont go looking for it you wont find it - only lists of endless deflecting answers."
4,The Iliad,"The Iliad was a very powerful book. The storyline is kind of hard to follow, at first, but once you know the characters, it's a much smoother read. Bernard Knox's introduction was very informative and interesting. If you like stories about war, or if you're into Greek Mythology, The Iliad is a must read."
5,"Of all the versions, the one I prefer!","I've had to read The Iliad for a variety of classes. Literature, Greek culture, etc., etc. Each professor used a different translation of The Iliad. Now I am Deaf and English is as foreign a language as I want to get. I do not have the linquistic background, or the patience for that particular venue of study. However, I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Iliad this time around rather finding it as a task I had to get through. Maybe it is just being older, but I think a lot of it had to do with Fagles' fine translation of this classic. They continue to use this version in many classes at the University of Pittsburgh, and when I have friends who have to read the Iliad, I tell them to go look for this particular translation. How accurate Fagles is I will leave up to academia to argue over...all I know is that I got an A+ in the class thanks to him. Karen Sadler, Science Education, University of Pittsburgh"
2,Hard to get through.,"Glad to be done with this one. Not a fun read. Felt much more like a school assignment. I might have enjoyed it if I was into Greek mythology, or animal sacrifice, or gory battlefield carnage, or women being treated as objects to be won by victorious armies. I don't know, call me crazy, but not my thing!"
1,Homer for the crude and ignorant,"Renders Homer into modern language, profanity and all. The problem is that Homer would never, ever have used equivalent language in his time especially given the context in which this epic poem was read. This is more like ""Homer Simpson"" than Homer the Greek."
3,The Iliad good and boring,"The Iliad is a great book about mythology in ancient times. I thought that the book was well written, but it had a lot of extraneous information throughout. It takes a long time to read for it seems as if the story flows slowly. Since I found it was taking a long time to read I was getting bored with it. It's not like a book where you pick it up and can't put it down. It has a lot of good vocabulary in it and is good to read for an English class. Overall it was a good story but it was long a drawn out too much."
2,it was ok i guess...,"i heard my translation was more poetic than this one but since the fagles translation isnt carried by this site, ill put my $.02 in here i guess... honestly i didnt like this book much the first time i read it (over this past summer for a 10th grade reading list) i found it boring and at times gory. but then we started reading it again in class and something strange happened , i started to actually understand what was going on and i strated to analyze the characters more deeply and i started to almost like it . im not going to go as far as saying id read it again on my own free will cause i definetly wont, but if you read this book read the odyssey as well i liked it better ..i dont particulary recommend this book or this translation but if you really wanna read it , search for the Fagles translation , itll make it less painful"
2,One sick puppy,"The Illiad was one of the hardest books that I had to read all year. It consisted of words that i have never heard, much less being able to pronounce them. The story line was an adventures one, but was hard to follow as i read since it was in a poem format. The scenes of death were preety interesting. The way Homer tells you specifically how each character dies is cool, but also a little disturbing. I encourage people who are into the whole greek mythology to get into this book. As for me, I don't ever want to read this book again."
2,What is the big deal?,"All the zombies kept telling me to purchase the Iliad and were raving about how intellectual it was. The age of it should have been a first clue. Really a rather boring read that is tripe with inept ideals. Homer Simpson was named after this guy but I believe that he has more insight into the subject matter than the original home boy they call Homer. Good for using to set your coffee mug on and start a fire with in the fireplace, but beyond that it is really a lot of rubbish. I wish Penguin Classics would actually publish classic reading material instead of a lot of blah blah."
1,Abridgement? Why didn't Penguin say so on the box ???,"Like some of the other readers offering reviews, I was disappointed to learn that this is an abridged version of such a great work. The fact that ""abridged"" appears nowhere on the box will makes me more cautious when buying Penguin audio books in the future."
3,"Audio great, but error in contents","I work at a Library and ordered this specifically for a library user. He paid for it and then donated it back to our Library after listening to it. He did enjoy it, but somehow misssed that CD #5 was in the package twice and there was no CD #6! By the time he gave it back to me for processing, it was too late to return or exchange it. Too bad for us. So, check the contents carefully if you choose to buy this CD."
3,Audio cassette version is abridged,"Note that the 1992 audio cassette version featuring Derek Jacobi is an abridged version of the Fagles translation. The reading omits books 5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17, and 23. That said, the basics of the story and much of the poetry are preserved, and Jacobi is enjoyable to listen to."
5,"I mean, you HAVE to read it...","What's there to say? It's the Iliad. The most important war novel, nay, the most imporant NOVEL, of all time. Timeless characters, amazing story, and a thousand and one side plots [used] by every hackeneyed fantasy author in the last 3000 years. There is no substitute for Fagles translation. He makes verse read like prose without sacraficing the rhthym and flow of Homer. Simply put, any intelligent (or pseudo-intelligent, like me) person MUST read this at some point, and Fagles book is the best out there."
5,One year overdo,"I had ordered the Odyssey for my son two years ago. He absolutelyloved hearing the story read. He said he got so much more out of itthen when reading it himself. I was supposed to have ordered TheIliad last year, but reordered the Odyssey by mistake. This yearhe finally got The Iliad. He said that hearing it read adds a wholenew level of appreciation to the book. Would highly recommend it toanyone who is reading it. My son is an adult. Had read the books inhigh school, but never gained the appreciation of the stories untilhe heard them read outloud."
4,Avoid the Introduction,"I liked this version of the Epic but I do still prefer the antiquated versions. I had a hard time imagining Homer using the same kinds of language that Lombardo used. He takes some liberties but if you are reading it for the first time, or if you can't comprehend Shakespeare, then this is a good starting place. If you don't mind older English, then I would recommend an older translation - the language seems more fitting, more poetic.Aside from the content, the introduction is really long and it summarizes the entire story. Don't bother with it unless you have to. Just read the story and skip it. There is nothing in there that you cannot read in the content of the story. The introduction seems to read as an essay that tells you the plot, what the best parts are supposed to be, and what you should think of them. It is tedious and really serves no purpose unless the book is an assigned reading and you just don't have time to finish it."
5,Praise from a classical literature novice,I don't know much about classical literature but this translation by Robert Fagles is so clear and easily accessible that I enjoyed every minute of the Iliad. The anger and the tragedy come across in all the burning glory that I guess Homer intended. My favourite read of 2006.I am tempted by Fagles' translation of the Aeneid now...
3,"Readable, quasi-poetic, inaccurate","I just finished an extension course on The Iliad, and had the luxury of picking whatever translation I desired. I tried many, including Fagles, and a bit of the Greek original, and came to this conclusion:Don't be misled by poetic or quasi-poetic translations. These can never do justice to a language incompatible with English, and miss the concision and power of Homer. If you want poetry, read Christopher Logue's reimagining of the epic in his several books.Instead, get the best literal translation. For me right now, that's Hammond. Fagles tries to combine both worlds, and is unsatisfactory in either. I must admit, the packaging is handsome, but Fagles takes too many liberties with the text. For instance, when the text is repeated in Greek, it should be repeated in English, but Fagles doesn't do this.At least Fagles is readable, unlike Lattimore, whose English does not trip happily on the tongue much of the time."
1,Too Much is Cut,"Where is Book X? One of the most exciting and heroic stories is cut from the reading: the night raid by Odysseus and Diomedes. Although the reading is well done, the absence of so much of the poem destroys the original intent. Pass on this one.Also, Penguin Press is misleading in that Jakobi is not the sole reader. There is a woman who reads as well. It sounds like this one was pieced together. A shoddy job really."
5,Great Version,"I thought that this was a fun read despite being made to for a class. I found that even though this was an abridged version, it held plenty of detail for my taste and I understood the story fairly well all along. It was a great story already, and being able to have a clearer picture of what was happening made the story more enjoyable. I would recommend this version to any one interested in reading The Iliad."
3,The Illiad,This is a classic poem for all history buffs. It teaches about the Trojan War and how many people will trick others to get what they want. It teaches people to never accept gifts from strangers.
3,Abridging Homer. Why?,"However splendidly Jacobi reads the work, it is still not what the poet (or translator) had in mind. An abridged version isn't worth the time."
4,If only...,"I actually enjoyed reading it. I hated reading this in college. The translation I read in college was pure torture, with a stiffness/stuffyness/fussiness that could not have possibly reflected the original epic. It must have been something like this translation, how else would it survive all these milennia if it did not at some time hold one's interest?I gave it 4 stars because there are only so many descriptions of how many ships, countries, how many troops and how many animals were cut up and burned that I can read before I start skipping when I see them starting and repeating over and over again (and skipping did not detract if you are not interested in Greek sacrifice techniques or who was who's brother or the son of which minor god).It is a true novel of war. It is very violent. Just because it is old doesn't mean it is florid and sweet - just the opposite!"
4,The story of the Trojan War,"I read the Robert Fagles edition of the Iliad. I read it after reading the Robert Fitzgerald translation of ""The Odyssey"". This book is very important. It was Alexander the Great's favorite book. The subject of the book is the Trojan War. The book has various gruesome descriptions of battles. The book ends with the death of Hector. Unfortunately the story behind the fall of Troy is not given. The sequel, ""The Odyssey"", gives brief references to the Trojan Horse and also references the death of Achilles (Odysseus meets him in the Underworld).The Iliad is really long and at times gets dull with the endless descriptions of infantrymen killing each other. It is still well written and is essential reading for a knowledge of ancient Greek mythology. The book addresses the sadness behind war."
2,"Okay, if you don't mind not getting what you paid for.","It skips, it's mislabled, it misses parts that it claims to include...otherwise the reading is excellent. Perhaps it was my copy...I don't know."
2,Read this BEFORE you buy!,The cover is very pretty thanks to Penguin books. BUT.. this translation is seriously lacking in elegance. Trust me. Look into buying Robert Fitzgerald's tranlation or my personal favorite -Samuel Butler's tranlation. They are far more poetic and descriptive than Robert Fagle. I recommend picking up two translations and comparing the same few pages from the same chapters. I honestly don't know why Robert Fagle got such high praise for this. Take my advice and get Samuel Butler or Robert Fitzgerald's translation.
3,Audio version is abridged,"Derek Jacobi is incredible in the reading of Fagles' wonderful translation. His voices and acting make almost all audio recordings sound amateurish. However, no where on the label did it say this was an abridged version and I for one am appalled that it was cut and the buyer did not know. It mentions it on this amazon webpage but not in the stores. So five stars for the reading and the translations, one star for the abridgment."
2,Not that great,"Seriously. Homer wasn't all that, and I'm so thankful to Amazon.com to allow me to give it only two stars.Homer's boring, and he's totally overrated. He's always using the same lines- ""bit the dust"", ""rosy-fingered dawn"", ""the wine-dark sea"", ""night filled his eyes"", ""Achilles swift of foot""- Homer needs to be more original. And what's with the one name- ""Homer""- who does he think he is, Madonna?"
3,Open package sale,There is nothing wrong with the Freud bit but the package was already open and shaft had some scratch marks assume it was used a few timesT
5,"Great ablum, often overlooked indeed.","This is a great album by The Clash. Many of my favorite songs originated on this album. Guns on the Roof is a very powerful song, with great lyrics and strummers yelling to boot. I would very much suggest this album."
2,Not too good.,"This album is not very good, but nobody's really to blame. There are really only two good songs, Safe European Home and English Civil War (the live version of which is much better than this one) and a load of mediocre to awful ones.But this was a transitonal album and it was on the tour for Give 'Em Enough Rope that _London Calling_ was born, so one can't complain too much.For Die-hard Clash fans, this is, of course essential. But for everyone else, skip it and buy the Boxed set!"
3,'Pon my soul....,"but this recording shall be for completists only. Any man who is supporting the first album and is serious about the group shall but this for the trilogy of safe european home, english civil war, and tommy gun, because the rest, unfortunately, is unsalvegeable toss.This can be blamed on the Blue Oyster Cult producer Sandy Pearlman, who, if he has not died from heart failure and/or obesity, should be caught and crucified (unless he is too flabby)."
5,My fav clash album,"This has to be my favorite clash album because you can see the transition from their debut to London Calling. It has some punk s, reggae, some pop songs it has it all. All the songs are pretty awesome but i guess the other two albums are great too. If you're getting into the Clash this and the other two albums are all you need. Get this album just for the first three songs and ""Stay free"" which are probably among the Clash's best."
1,XP COMPATIBILITY,"Not really compatible. Will work with Win Xp cmpatability wizard set to Win 98 and visual themes disabled. BUT, the desktop will not return to original settings upon closing and Kid Pix 3 leaves programs running in the background which must be manually closed through Win Task Manager. A sad situation in a K-12 education setting attempting to use up to date Windows and preserve their software investment."
3,"Good product, but needs update","My niece introduced this software to me and I bought it for my kids, who use it for hours. However, the Mac version will only run under OS 9 or in Classic mode under OS X and stability under Classic can be shaky. Broderbund needs to do what most other companies have done and update the software to run natively under OS X."
5,I was thrilled!,"I was so thrilled when i loved this software on the computer for my so. it took a bit to load up and i thought to myself, I probably won't have enough memeory to run it. But it installed fine and started up quickly. My son loved it, there's so much for him to explore and create with. We played together to learn some of the tools. he picked up on it right away. so now he plays with it by himself. He's only 4 and I know this will last quite a few years entertaining him!i would definitely recommend this product!"
2,This is not intuitive and is not like our school version.,"The Deluxe 3rd edition of Kid Pix is not like the Kid Pix version we have at my children's school. It is not intuitive and in fact when we sat down to type some sentences for a report, we ""lost"" our page and had to retype them and on the second try, we ""lost"" them again and got some kind of error. I would like to sell this version and get the standard version."
1,doesn't work with Windows XP,"Don't waste your money. This version doesn't work with Windows XP, I tried several times to install it with no success."
2,kid pix,"Great idea,when it works, but it crashes on my computer all the time, have to re start. There are no directions."
1,Installed but will not open - no help from support,"My child raved about this program from school. So I bought it and installed it on a computer that had the correct requirements. It seemed to install, but it will not open. It has a ton of error codes, none of which are in the knowledge base at the software company's site. I contacted support and explained the issue and am still waiting for a resolution or even a response of some kind."
1,Think twice before buying this product,"I bought this version for my daughter after reading the negative reviews about Version 4. She loves using this at school and wanted Santa to bring it. He did, and it has been nothing but a frustration...it keeps sending multiple Windows errors (we have tried on several versions on Windows)....and shutting down....debug errors, etc. Their customer support is only on line, closed until Jan 3rd and the FAQs were not helpful at all. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Doesnt work,"Dont buy this! I tried 4 computers all apparently compatible according to the box but the disc is expired. By the time I got around to trying them all and realizing it wasn't user error, the return window to amazon expired. Dont waste your money."
1,Frustrating,"When I (the grandmother) first installed the game, it worked well. Then it seemed to ""kick in and kick out"" all the times after that. The kids ( 6 and 7) were frustrated that they could not get through want they wanted to do without the game ""knocking off.""I have uninstalled it and installed it again, and this did not work! Apparently this is a defective disk, but it does not pay for me to return it, since the shipping would be almost as much as the disk itself.My feeling is that it is an ""old"" disk.I will not order from your company again.Thank you.Pat Sweeney -[...]"
3,Works in XP!,I think this is a great program! Runs under XP SP2 with no probs! I gave it a 3 star because I Have a Mac OS X and it runs exetremely slow and quits by itself alot. But it is still a great program on XP computers.
4,2nd graders love kid pix 3,"We have been using Kid Pix Studio Deluxe in our school for over 3 years. I bought this new version to try out with my class and they thought it was great. They all wanted to try out the new features, which they thought enhanced the program even more. I will definitely use this use version with my class in the fall. I use it to get my students interested in learning computer skills and to have fun at the same time. I gave it a four because I had to really spend time learning the new setup ,because it is so different. One big plus,I don't have to set the video settings at 256 colors."
2,not very user friendly,"I think I'm going to enjoy using this program once I get over my HUGE initial frustration that comes with learning a new software program that doesn't have adequate instruction! The manual has to be printed up; I would have preferred to have had an actual BOOK to refer to -- I guess software companies don't do that any more? It's very frustrating, to say the least. I don't see how kids can figure things out on their own with this program. It's a pretty intense experience to guess at what to do. Call me computer illiterate, but that's the way it is."
1,Software doesn't work,"Running winXP and software will not work on it. Has an error with QTime, no matter the version. Says that Qtime is required during installation but errors everytime. Tried it on 2 winxp PCs, still would not work."
2,NOT FOR OSX 10.5 Leopard,"This is a very old version of KidPix from 1999 and will ONLY work within the classic layer of OS X 10.4 or earlier. (Hence the cheap price). If you have Apple's latest Operating System 10.5 or newer and/or if you want to run the upgraded version you will need to purchase KidPix Deluxe 3X with a SRP of 39 dollars. The box looks almost exactly the same, so be sure to look for that tiny ""X""!"
3,Dissapointing ending,the story was great! until the last chapter! it just didn't make any sense!I was truly disappointed
3,Should have been a better read,"In a word-disappointing. The story line had promise, but the execution left something to be desired. I wanted to believe in the plot, but it was just too hard to do. Also, Moms will have a hard time with the final chapters."
2,for aspiring gourmet chefs only,"Based on this book's title, I believed I would get simple, delicious recipes. Instead, I found recipes for meals that I would expect to find on the menu at a gourmet restaurant. I have a four-year-old step-daughter to consider when I cook, and I know she wouldn't touch half of the meals this book contains. Additionally, many of the recipes contain obscure ingredients like tapenade, lamb's kidneys, and goat cheese. Am I the only one who doesn't have these items on my grocery list? I guess I might use one or two of the main dish recipes if I were trying to impress a dinner guest... I will say that the soup, salad and dessert recipes look inviting, but I wouldn't make those either unless I were entertaining. All in all, I don't suggest buying the book unless you're an aspiring gourmet chef."
5,Fill the Bathtub; Fill Your Heart,"Splashes of Serenity by Elaine W. Miller is a book of comfort and love for mothers with a foundation of Scripture guiding each family story followed by a restorative meditative passage. As warm bathwater soothes our tired bodies the one page stories and meditations soothe one's heart and soul. This book is written for moms and urges us to stay focused and work through individual situations no matter how difficult that might be. However, anyone could benefit from reading the love-filled one page passages."
4,A very good example of 19th century organmusic in NL,"These disks (4) give a broad view / sound to what organmusic was about in the 19th century. And not only that, but also a very good example of the organs built in the central netherlands in this period. When you're hearing the sound, you will be impressed by the very special sound of Witte."
3,Umpires: From those who made the call but aren't remembered,Stories told by former umps -- some of whom were considered marginal umps. That fact makes it interesting reading. It is a good research tool. But better reading can be found in Gerlach's book.
4,good death metal,"Don't get me wrong I'm about as big a fan of Six Feet Under as any casual metalhead, but when I had heard Swarm! I knew that change was a good thing. They actualy sound very similar to that of Six Feet Under, but it's just the whole feel of it as an album is so good. The standout tracks are definately ""Funeral for the Masses"" ""Obsessed with Homicide"" and ""Heading towards the Butchery"""
3,Disappointing,"I quickly ordered this book after reading the first five pages on Amazon.com, convinced that I would love it. However, I was sorely disappointed. The characters were likeable enough, however too much of the plot was given away on the back cover of the book or by foreshadowing within the book itself. The few details of the story that weren't so easy to guess (or read on the back) were not very exciting. I found myself simply wanting to finish the story, and was never really absorbed by the plot. Very unsatisfying. On a positive note, there were some very amusing parts concerning the main character's daytime jobs -- reminded me of a few of my summer jobs in college! All in all, it was simply average entertainment. I am not sure if I would call it a waste of time, but it was pretty darn close!"
1,Not Impressed,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, sadly I was unimpressed. The Divorce Remedy is all about the author...it is a book specifically designed to allow the author to mention herself in as many paragraphs as she possibly can. She derides other therapists and sets herself up as some kind of messiah.Perhaps she does have the answers but I got so sick of the narcissim that I stopped reading it."
2,TRUST ME READ THIS!!!!!!!,"Listen I know a lot about electric scooters and dirtbikes. About 6 months ago I purchased the Honda minimoto maxxi it was great and all until it broke. Then I got the minimoto go kart that piece of junk broke also. I took it back to Toys R Us and they said that the go kart had motor trouble. The circuit breaker kept popping because of too much power being released into the motor. Soon after that I took my minimoto maxxi in and it had the same problem. Trust me dont listen to other reviews. My cousin has this thing and its not worth it. I mean think about it would i write all this if i was lying? Go buy the razor dirtbike its called the razor MX500 dirtbike and (...)its 500 watts 36 volts PADDED SEATS wich the minimoto dirtbike has plastic seats, and the razor MX500 dirtbike goes up to 17 MPH NOT 15MPH like the Minimoton dirtbike. TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!"
2,dont waste your money,People if you go to the nearest Toys R Us near you ask them to see this dirtbike. It is a piece of junk. Yes the picture does look cool on the internet but it is really not good. Its like sitting on a rock that moves. The shocks are horrible and you feel every bump. It is built pretty good but the seat and shocks and overall duribility is awful.DO NOT BUY
5,A profoundly beautiful story,"The Cat Who Went to HeavenThe original illustrations are better than in the newest edition. Profoundly beautiful and wise. Lovely story about a poor Japanese painter and his housekeeper and what happens when she comes home from the market with a cat instead of food. A window into a culture that is disappearing. A Buddhist story but transcends Buddhism. Touching, positive, poignant. For reading to children, probably not for under 6?? I only was given this book as an adult but treasure it and re-read it every year or so.If the original illustrated version is not being re published, I would grab these used copies."
5,Great Owl Puppet,"I got this for my wife because she collects all things owl these days. Pretty small, even compared to the picture displayed. Well made, so it looks like I have a few years to sleep with him above our bed!"
5,Precious,The is a fine collection of Karaite writings. The volume gives you an ample survey of Karaism's finest scholars and their works on scripture
4,As good as they get!........,"I believe the trailer for this movie stated ""it will have you laughing, crying,dancing in the aisles!"" Or something to that effect. Well it did just that to me! And to be honest the soundtrack is better than the movie! Holly may not have even come close to sounding like this live,but you'll think he did!You will HOPE he did! The guys (Busey,Smith,Stroud) Bring life to the music. Stand outs include: That'll be the day, Rave on, Oh boy! and others. If your a Holly fan you WILL enjoy it! If your a REAL rock and roll fan you'll love it!"
5,Outstanding on Vinyl,"I'm lucky enouch to own a vinyl copy of this, which I'd strongly recommend. The #s are packed with energy in respectable tribute to the spirit of the legendary Holly. I'm not sure if the CD measures up to the fiesty 50s flare that long lost vinyl is able to reincarnate. Long live Buddy, wherever he may be!"
4,good album' all in all'.,"well this album is a good album but its need'ed more songs to me way to many were left out like cryin waitein hopein it dont matter anymore. bo didley and thats just three i could say rite off the batt. but like i said way to many were left off the album. but all in all i guess the album is still a good album. the best one is maybe baby in newyork. kelly,"
4,This book helped me to heal,There was one particular chapter in this book that contributed to my healing process. Sometimes you cannot reconcile and I learned that it would be okay. I'd read too many books that made me feel like I wasn't trying hard enough.
1,The irony is unbearable,"How handy! Having bought for my daughter the book that practically destroyed our family (A Courage to Heal)on the recommendation of her inept therapist, now that my daughter is waking up from her nightmare of starvation and drug-induced hallucinations and recanting the horrifying, bizarre and provably false accusations she made under the influence of her therapist and a lesbian-feminist-incest-survivor support group, we can now buy the book that will put us all together again - from the same author. One stop shopping! One thing I'll say for Laura Davis - she sure is entrepreneurial.I picked up this book in the bookstore, began reading through it and wanted to rip it apart. In this book Laura Davis almost suggests that she is prepared to admit her memories of her own incest may not be entirely accurate. Wow. That's just great. The person I feel truly sorry for (other than all the people damaged by idiot therapists using Courage to Heal as their manual)is Laura Davis' mother."
3,works ok if you know its limtations,"I seriously doubt that the alarm is 86 db. however, it does make a sound and it lights up if the power goes out. If you're a light sleeper and need it to monitor power in the same room with you, it might wake you up. Or if you just want it for the light if the power goes ont, it's good for that. I have it right by my bed to let me know if the power goes out, and I'm a light sleeper so I've heard it chirp when, say, the refrigerator or the heat pump kicks on. So it's very sensitive, I'll give it that. But I wouldn't trust it to monitor power in another room or in the basement or shed.The manufacturer ought to put in a better speaker so it could live up to its claim of being an alarm. You get what you pay for; this unit is a lot less expensive than some other devices I've seen advertised, that proport to do this same thing and have generally better reviews."
2,Terrible alarm.,"I moved fron the apartment into a used RV (1999 Hitchiker Premiere) in August 2012.The RV has a 30 amp Circuit box and we are frequently losing power like every time the heat pump and water heater are on at the same time. I bought this at another site and everything works (well sort of).The light works fine but the power off alarm is so weak it is pointless. First the alarm sounds much like a Cricket, and the volume of the alarm would never wake me in my sleep. It may wake a light sleeper but would never wake a sound sleeper even If the loss of power alarm was plugged in an outlet in the bedroom.The developers need to increase the decibel level or change the crickets sound for a real alarm clock sound or better a siren,"
2,I hope it wakes me,I hope my subconscious wakes me up from a sleep if my power goes out. It might be better than nothing (I hope).
2,Weak alarm!,"I'll be honest, for the money, this isn't bad. However, if you are any distance from the alarm when it sounds, you might not hear it. If it's in your garage or in a closed room, I highly doubt you would be able to hear it. If your alarm clock was this loud, you would be late for work on a daily basis!!So, if you need a nightlight-style of device to light your way in the event of a power outage, it might work in a pinch. But if you need you rely on it to alert you to a critical loss of power for a freezer, water pump, etc., I'd look elsewhere."
1,Poor communication,"The device we ordered and paid for quit working after a few days. I have emailed the address given on the invoice about replacement and have received NO RESPONSE from the company.The device is supposed to beep and flash when current is off in the house....no current has been off since Oct 20, 2009 when it was purchased....but it beeps and flashes constantly when plugged up.I really don't like it when an email for support is given and no one will answer. I asked that it be replaced or for someone to at least contact me, but nothing has been done.Thank you."
2,More like 20 decibals of sound. No way is it 86 decibals.,"The light flashes and works well when the power goes off. But the company's claim that it gives off 86 decibals of sound is just a flat out lie. It probably is something more like 20 decibals, a sound like a softer version of an electric alarm clock ring. This worries me that I can sleep through a power outage with my cpap mask on."
3,Not loud enough,"A handy device, but the alarm is not loud enough. It cannot be heard outside whatever room it is placed, so this is not for that garage or basement refrigerator."
2,Power failure alarm,This item is greatly underpowered. I would buy something that would wake me next time.
1,useless,I planned to use this alarm on my basement circuit for my freezer. The light is bright but the alarm is so queit that I could never hear it upstairs. I put it in my bedroom but I don't even know if it will wake me in the event of a power outage. Looks like I bought an expensive flashlight.
1,None of the functions described worked at time of delivery.,"So disappointing. Mostly because I have to go to the trouble to repackage and return this defective device to a warranty dept. that will either ""repair or replace"" the same item. Great. I don't have much faith. I should have read more closely. I NEVER purchase unless total refund is an option. In addition, I am stuck with the money to ship the thing for repair or replacement. My bad. This will not happen again. Recommendation; DO NOT BUY"
3,Should not be labeled as an alarm.,"Works fine as a backup light when the power goes out so you don't fumble around looking for a flashlight if you're caught with no power at night. The beeper is no louder than a watch and is near useless as it wouldn't wake most people up (which is what I bought it for) I'm a manager of a convenience store that is down the street from my house and was using this to alert me if we lost power so I could go in and help shut down the store. However I found myself having to purchase a new device because this would not wake me up. Also its somewhat large and does consume an outlet. However, having the light available if the power goes out does make this device worth it."
2,Two of Three received devices do not alarm nor provide light!,"I ordered three of these units after reading the reviews and understanding that the alarm is not very loud.One of the units was to replace a similar device which did not include an alarm and the other twounits were additional units for additional locations. I plugged all three units into live AC receptacles andlet them charge for a week. The dim green 'power on' indicator was lighted on all three units. Today, I decided is was time to see if they worked.Only ONE OF THE THREE units alarmed and provided light from the three LEDs. The OTHER TWO units did not work at all!I purchased them from one of the sellers here on amazon.com. Today, I called the seller and they promised to ship out two replacement units.They do not require that I send the defective units back. I like the fact that the AC Power prongs do not fold. I have had problems withfolding prongs arcing and burning the metal which they contact on the mating Printed Circuit Board."
1,Way to quiet.,"I have very good & sensative hearing. I bought 2 of these. However, I had this next to my bed & did not hear it alarm. In my opinion it is to quiet. Its great feature of the light is a plus. However, hard of hearing or deep sleepers would not hear this alarming. Items were returned."
4,THP207,Works as stated. Alarm volume is too low to place anywhere accept near the bed. It is as loud as the alarm I use to wake. I have a water well and this product gives peace of mind during cold temperatures as I use a heat lamp. I would reccomend to anyone who has a freezer also.
3,"Not an ALARM... a little beeper, perhaps","For something that's supposed to alert you to something as important as an electrical failure, this isn't very ""ALARMING."" I read others' reviews here and decided to try it anyway. Well, they were right. Imagine the weakest battery-operated digital alarm clock you can imagine. That's the sound. Little tiny beeps. Almost like from one of those LED alarm wristwatches! If you're in the same room, it would work. But forget it if you're not. Mine is in the garage in an outlet with a side-by-side refrigerator/freezer. I tested it. Can't hear it at all inside the house... even right outside the door. But since we're in and out of the garage many times a day, we'll catch a power outtage within 12 hours or so... and this will be heard as soon as we open the door. It's far from ideal, but not total crap. The light is pretty bright. They should have put more thought into the, er, ""alarm."""
5,Works great...,"I haven't really had to use this yet because the power hasn't gone out, but just from tripping the GFI, it seems like it will work fine. Have it for my garage freezer that we don't use too often, but has lost electricity twice, ruining all the stuff in it."
3,Power alarm,"The alarm works as it should, I have it plugged in safe-garding my freezer outlet I wish the alarm was a lot louder"
3,Its okay,this is an ok product. i thought the alarm would be louder. i dont think it is as loud as an alarm clock by any means. works as described.
1,dissappointed,This alarm sound was too low in volume to be effective. A big disappointment. A louder sound is needed to wake one up.
3,alarm? NOT!,"Unless you have super hearing, this will not work as a PF alarm in a garage. As loud as a conventional alarm clock? NOT! More like as loud as a small battery operated wristwatch alarm. Luckily, it plugs in upside down or it would have blocked the refrigerator plug."
1,Completely useless product,"I bought this hoping it would warn us of a power failure on the circuit to our chest freezer. The light is cute, but the so-called alarm buzzer of 85 dB is a joke. it may be 85 dB if you place it right next to your ear, but from a distance of 20 feet, it is barely audible. to make matters worse, our unit broke in less than 3 weeks. I would not recommend this to anyone; I wish the star ratings allowed an entry of zero stars"
1,Power fail alarm,"I don't feel that the device performs as advertised. The alarm was said to emit an alarm sound of 86 DB, if I recall correctly. The alarm sound could barely be heard across the room and information I read concerning sound levels said that a sound level of 86 DB would damage your hearing if exposed for a long period. I wanted to use the alarm to alert me If I lost power to my freezer in the garage and this unit certainly would not do that. I returned the unit."
4,Good Power Outage Alarm/Flashlight,"This product performed as advertised during a recent power outage. As others have stated, the alarm is not very loud. The volume is similar to an alarm clock and worked for us, but it probably would not be heard in a remote location of your house, e.g. garage or cellar. It does meet our needs though."
3,Great alarm but not for the hard of hearing,"This is an excellent warning device for people with normal hearing. Age and years working in a high noise environment has destroyed my high frequency hearing. This device is barely audible to me at five feet - I cannot hear anything above 10,000 cps. Be aware of your physical limitations - it is not a product deficiency if you can not hear it."
1,Don't bother,"Great idea -- lousy execution. The alarm is about as loud as a cheap travel alarm clock. Can't hear it in the next room even. Does it do what it advertises? Yes, EXCEPT it is not loud enough to be useful."
3,Not bad...Could definitely be improved.,"So far, it seems fine. Like others have said...the alarm will barely wake someone up. I was fine with that since I knew from the reviews before purchasing. However I do wish it functioned as a nightlight to have more usefulness."
4,Reliance Controls THP207 Plug-In Power Failure Alarm with LED Flashlight,No power outs yet...hard to review at this time. Compact & easy to plug in. Hope it works we don't want anymore flooding!
1,NO WAY IS THIS ALARM 85dB.,I PURCHASED THIS BECAUSE OF THE ALARM FEATURE. WELL WHAT THIS IS IS A POOR 3 LED RECHARGEABLE FLASH LIGHT WITH AN ALARM THAT IS NOT AS LOUD AS MY ALARM WRIST WATCH. BAD PRODUCT. AMAZON SHOULD RMOVE THIS FROM THEIR INVENTORY.
4,works as advertised,"It works great for my needs, monitoring a circuit with an 12 amp electric smoker plugged into it. My only complaint is that I wish it was louder."
2,Not Much of An Alarm,"I was disapointed with this alarm. The audible states 72db, no way this is that loud. The Light works as stated, overall, I'm not happy with this product. I will be returning it and looking for something louder."
2,THP207,"The idea for the THP207 is great and is needed but the siren output is not loud enought to awake most sleepingpeople. Had I known, I would have invested a little more money into a model that provides a louder output.The unit would be more useful if the output frequency of the siren is lower.thanks,John Embrey"
2,Alarm is a faailure.,If it were on a pillow next to you it might wake a person. A very light sleeper might be awakened by the light in a normal dark room. Product was discarded as intructed.
2,Very nicely made but has a big problem.,"I wanted a device which would awaken me when the 115Vac would be OFF for whatever reason. Well this device does not quite do it. The buzzer which does come on in an ON-OFF fashion runs at a frequency which only young people or dogs can hear.If you are older then you may only hear it when it is about 10"" away from you.The device is extremy well made and performs as advertised. However, if you want to be certain you are awakend by this device be sure you hear audio within the 1,500-3000 frequency range."
2,not loud enough,I purchased this power failure alarm to wake us up in an event that the electric would go out. We run a fish farm and if the pumps are not running then we loose fish which has happened in the past. The item works but the alarm is not very loud. This is the only complaint and not sure it will help us. We have it plugged into our bedroom outlet. The light works fine.
4,Interesting Concept,"This is the 2nd pair of THP207 that have been purchased for our home. They work well and aren't an eyesore on the wall, (we had some really ugly ones before these). I think it's bizarre that an alarm will go off on it (optional) if the power goes out. Although this is to help people reset their alarm clocks so they don't oversleep, I'd hate to be woken at 4 in the morning for a power outage. My suggestion, get a alarm clock that has a battery backup or use your cell phone alarm."
2,Not much louder than an alarm wrist watch,This item works as described but is not nearly as loud as the advertised 86db. It is not much louder than an alarm wristwatch. My alarm clock is much louder. I was awake one night when we lost power and this alarm didn't wake my wife who was sleeping about 20 feet away. And she's a light sleeper! If you want a real alarm try another brand. This may wake you if it's right next to your pillow.
2,Reliance Controls Plug-in Power Failure Alarm,Alarm is very low in volume. Will not be able to hear alarm if I lose power.
1,A tedious read with a limp finish.,"If our gallant author wished to rehash the drug inducedsixties, why did he distort the story with an unbelievableand childishly tangled murder plot?"
3,Six hours worth listening to,I just completed listening to this book. I really enjoyed the characters. I thought Turow did a great job. I could really picture the court room in my mind. I could see the lawyer's at their tables. The witnesses on the stand. This book keeps you on your toes. Keeps you thinking. It was a great way to pass the time while on my eight hour drive on the interstates between NW Iowa and NE Illinois.
5,Scott Turow Commands the Literary Landscape,"The intelligence and insight of Turow cannot be matched by many. Not only does he spin a powerful who-done-it here, but his literary expertise and masterful insights are throughly thought provoking. I really enjoyed this novel, perhaps more than Presumed Inoccent. Don't let the nay-sayers who applaud the likes of Grisham let you miss out on a top rate novel."
3,A Mixed Bag,"While giving the reader twice the substance of a Grisham novel, Turow also manages to deliver half the suspense. The book is filled with complicated characters who wear out their welcome after the first three hundred pages. Even though Turow has many clever and even humorous moments, the plot simply runs out of steam by the end. This is quite unfortunate since a streamlined version would have been powerful and memorable. As is, it is only marginally satifying."
2,"Sloppy, dull","I agree with others who find this over-written. I was also SO annoyed with the typos and grammatical errors that riddled the book. NOTE TO TUROW - learn the difference between ""which"" and ""that."" I returned it to the library only half-read."
4,"Flawed, but Turow's gifts carry the day","Presumed Innocent is a classic, but I disliked Burden of Proof. This book was long, and the Sixties sections were overly talky, but the way Turow wove many of his past characters into an intricate, compelling plot was masterful. Turow has a gift for capturing dialogue, especially in the scenes in the projects. I could not put this book down because I wanted to know what really happened during the opening crime scene. It is so far beyond the typical quality in this genre (Grisham, Patterson), that I am surprised by the bad reviews here."
4,"Less than Presumed Innocent, but better than Grisham.","Yes, this book is complicated and long. But for those with a keen literary eye, it delivers. I've been so disappointed with recent John Grisham novels that I found the weightiness and substantive content of this Turow novel very satisfying.I would agree with those who say that this book transcends the genre. This is no mere courtroom drama or legal thriller. It's really several novels in one; the flashback sequences to the 60s could even stand on their own. As a post-60s Gen Xer, I was intrigued with the seemingly eyewitness account of what life was really like back then.It is possibly true that this book may be a bit long. Yet I was so impressed with Turow's narrative voice and the authenticity of such a diverse cast of characters that it held my interest. A good deal of thought and research went into this one, and it really warrants a more thoughtful read than your average formulaic legal drama. Two thumbs up."
2,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"After reading such novels as PLEADING GUILTY and BURDEN OF PROOF, I was looking forward to reading the next installment.But, this novel was was of a lesser quality: flatter characters, not as much pacing and, just an overall lesser sense of emotional resonance.Note that this was after reading about 40 pages, but, my feeling is: if a book can't hold me after 40 pages, it isn't worth reading."
1,Didn't bother finishing it.,"The author tries to put himself into the characters by talking like them (speaking in jive and street for the brothers) whenever they're in conversation. It makes the book hard to read and follow when he jumps back and forth from one to the other. And Scott, white boys are incapable of speaking street, (there is a survival element ingrained that a pale man in America will never know) so you failed miserably (don't start wearing your hat backwards).. I just wish there where a return policy with Kindle.. I like all of Scott Turow's other books, so this one was a real disappointment."
1,Boring and long and boring,"This is one long, long never-ending story - which has some elements of thriller and courtroom drama - boring for my taste. There are too many flash-backs embedded in the main story-line; difficult to keep track of time or the main story as you skip the pages. Excessive is the word I would use to describe plots and sub-plots of this book. Skips chapters when you feel that the chapters don't go anywhere!Don't buy and don't read."
3,A baby boomer might enjoy this more than me...,The story is interesting and complex. I feel like I am missing some kind of understanding because I was not yet born in 1965. I guess I am having a hard time identifying with the main characters. But it did keep me intrigued enough to read through the end.
2,It gave me a headache!,"This is definately not Turow's best novel, I loved Burden of Proof and Presumed Innocent, but found this one to be long, and slow to progress and confusing with all of the jumps from past to present. Twice I put the novel down and read another book in between and the only reason I finished it was because I refuse to not finish a book I start!!"
4,A great flash back/flash forward read!,"As I completed Scott Turow's bestseller from 1996, I found myself thinking about how interesting it would have been to have grown up in the 60's and early 70's. Not that the mid 70's and early 80's were anything boring! Having read this well-written book, I found that not only was I reading an extremely compelling work of fiction but also a story entrenched in true non-fictional historical settings and events. The only fair comparison that could be made for a novel that did as good a job, if not better, of capturing the history, turbulence and romance of the 60's and early 70's would be Gary Drake's debut novel ""Silent Bell"". For any fan of Turow's ""Laws of our Fathers"", I recommend this novel as well!"
3,"three stars, but I still really liked it!","Meaning that five stars would be something that was among my favorite books of all time, which this certainly wasn't, but it was still a great read. The thing I really took away from it is how strong a writer Turow really is. He can easily write circles around Grisham, though this thought never came to while reading the book, only after reading other reader's reviews. There is really no comparison between the two. The writer whom Turow reminded me most of while reading this was Ed McBain, who also uses a fictional city, and who also has an encyclopedic knowledge of law and legal procedure, but, like Turow, does not make it seem encyclopedic. I was drawn into this book, and found it enjoyable throughout. I'll go so far as to say that Turow is better writer than Ed McBain. Just not as prolific"
1,Awful,"Boring, poorly written, too much offensive language. I'm not interested in ever ready Scott Turow again after this experience."
2,"Boring, boring, boring","I agree with most of what's already here--that is, with the reviews that gave it less than a 5. I wanted to add this: It's the only book I've ever read that I put down with 10 pages ago and didn't care to pick it up for about a week. Finally I finished it just to get it off of my bedside table. For a Turow book, this is amazing. I just didn't care at all what happened to these people. I feel like an idot for wasting my time. Perhaps if 200 pages were cut out of the book it could have been something. Maybe the novelization of the movie script?"
1,So disappointing,"I have loved all the author's other books and looked forward to reading this one; but what a disapointment. After reading these other reviews, I find I'm not alone. I'll look forward to his next release and hope he gets back on track."
1,"Plodding, ridiculous, uninteresting, unreadable.","After plodding through the gibberish of the first chapter, I was astonished about the confusing and unintersesting pages that followed. Is this really the same author of the previous books"
1,Why is bigger always assumed to be better?,"Wordy and digressive, I found this book both over-written and tedious reading. It lacks the focus of Turow's earlier books, seems an exercise in self-indulgence, much like The Big Chill"
3,Lengthy...,"Lengthy novel that has some good courtroom scenes but Turow's depiction of gangsta talk is laughable, and distracting. Read one his other books before this one and you will see why Turow is a favorite."
2,Don't Bother,"I bought this on a Hawaii vacation. I liked Presumed Innocent, and the book jacket showed promise. This guy is like many initially successful authors. They become full of themselves. This book is full of tangents and gratuitious nonsense. The story and plot line go straight downhill. He should have hired a consultant for the gangsta slang. It was unintelligible. I'm surprised I finished it."
2,"Watch 'Thirty-something"" reruns instead","My wife warned me. She said not to waste my time but having loved all of Turow's previous novels I sallied forth anyway. Being a child of the 60's, I was intrigued by the book's premise.How do children of that time cope with adult life? All I got was a bunch of whining similar to the recent series Thirtysomething except not as interesting. This book is too long, there is not enough story, and has unsympathetic characters. Unless your literary forte is characterization only, don't waste your time with this book.How can someone who wrote something as fresh as Presumed Innocent produce this drivel? If you want to gove Turow a try, try any of his earlier works! This one will scare you away from him permanently!!!!!!"
2,"Great build-up, poor finish","The story builds well with a fascinating court case, sprinkled with flashbacks to the main characters in their early years. The whole story comes apart in the last 25% of the book, and never recovers. I like Turow's work, this is not his best."
5,THE VERY BEST OF SCOTT TUROW,I understand the comments that this book is overly long and needed some editing but for me this is the prize of his fictional writing. I read it on visit I took to Italy and the book coloured the whole trip - in a good way.The story - characters - the sense of the time - all expertly drawn.I regard this book as one of the best I have read - and its fragrance stays with me -many years later.
1,A real sleeper,"I've read 100's of books to help clear my head before going to sleep at night. This is by far the worst book I've ever read. Slow, boring, most nights I can't get more than 2 pages before I fall asleep. I guess I'm getting my money's worth as a sleeper book. Don't waste yours."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but reading it was a chore","There's probably a good 300-page book hidden somewhere in this bloated 500-page tome. The idea of reconciling crimes and causes of the past with those of the present is an interesting one, there are some clever plot twists and the flashback scenes are fun. But every time the story switches to the present, boy, do things begin to drag. The characters bear little resemblence to their former selves, and it is hard to work up much concern about what happens to them. They tend to drone on and whine about themselves for pages and pages and pages. When the end finally comes, you're just glad to be rid of them"
2,Boring,"This book is confusing, slow, hard to pick up and in need of a good rewrite if not total trashing. The story constantly jumps back and forth in a very confusing manner. The narrator changes, sometimes confusing the author as he forgets who is supposed to be telling parts. It is not worth reading"
1,Is there a way to give a book a minus number?,Read his other books.This one is boriiiiing.Don't see the movie! Don't buy the paperback
1,What a disappointment!,"I expected another great Turow book & got nothing, but bland, long-winded drivel. There are very, very few books which I just refuse to waste my time finishing. This was one of them."
4,Yes and No,"I loved Presumed Innnocent. I like The Laws Of Our Fathers. I believe that most of these critiques are too harsh, and I want to adderess that. I think that Scott Turow is a great writer. Emphasis on writer. The story itself I had a problem with. Some of the people complaining about the book seemed to confuse the two. I do agree with the person who said that he was confused about the genre. But the writing is still superb, as are the insights and the way they are expressed. It may be the style that people object to. I do understand that it is a story told from one point of view, but I was in Vietnam, and I did sympathyze with those who objected to the war. I was there for my own personal reasons. The only view presented was one sided, and that is Ok. It is the story, and I'm not offended in any way. Only a little dissapointed. The WRITING is still great. Please keep it up."
2,Wish I had read these comments before I bought the book!,"Amen to those who thought this was overwritten. Was it a mystery, a social commentary on the 60's, or a love story? Turow tried to juggle all three and none of it was strong enough to keep me interested for over 800 pages. One of those books you get half way through and wonder if you should just give it up. By the final page you know you should have."
2,At least the first 1/2 of the book is boring,"I got to around page 260 and found I was bored by this book. I did not particularly like or dislike any of the characters, and the story line was meaningless to me. I skipped forward a couple of hundred pages, and it was still the same old same old. I quit. I have enjoyed Turow's other books, but I will not run out to buy his next one."
2,Disappointing,"History buffs of the `60's might find this one interesting, but that is about all there is to recommend it. The murder mystery is not strong enough to support the rest of the story. It's an in depth study of several characters who are linked together in the `60's and their reunion in the `90's around the murder of one of their group. The characters are mildly interesting, but again, not enough to carry the story. Mr. Turow's editor should have been more free with his pen. A struggle to finish."
3,"Written With Insight and Witt, But Never Clicked For Me","The Law of Our Fathers is an ambitious work, taking on several meaty, hot button issues from the last 40 years: war protesting, the Holocaust, political activism, recreational drug use, gang violence, poverty, grief and oh lets see, unhappy childhood/unresolved parental conflict/middle age divorce.Scott Turow writes such total insight and witt, its hard to believe that a writer can create characters with that total depth and rich history. This is a lengthy novel that takes time to journey through given its sheer size. The story itself unfolds as two parallel universes; flipping between the past and the present, with the breaks coming at times of suspense, so there is motivation to read on. However, the story can be boggy. And the characters themselves? I can't say I really connected with them. But I do appreciate a well written story with a complex plot.This is a typical work of Turow, just not my favorite."
4,Engrossing character studies with intellectual twists,"Mr. Turow proves himself again to be largely beyond comparison in the genre. I imagine that many of his contemporaries will read it with some sense of nostalgia for a bygone era. The characterizations are rich and complex, the story line engrossing. The reader who can follow the thickening plot to its conclusion will be richly rewarded with the surprising twists. I must say that I was highly impressed by the lucidity and passion of this text -- highly recommended!!!"
3,Not sure I'll pick up another Turow novel,"The book was rewarding only during the mid section. The ending was a surprise, but only because it whisked by unexpectedly without much importance. I think I'll reread ""Presumed Innocent"" before I buy another Turow novel. The paperback is 817 pages, quite a time investment for a book I don't think I'd read again."
3,I have read better books by Scott Turow,"I so enjoyed Scott Turow's other books (Burden of Proof, etc.) that I raced to buy this book and looked forward to reading it. This is book is confusing and difficult to follow. The plot is not all that exciting or interesting. I was very disappointed in this book."
2,"I really tried to like this, but...","While I am an admitted fan of Mr. Turow, this offering almost made me rethink my committment. Yes the characterization and dialogue are first rate, but the work as a whole failed to capture my interest. Every time I started to get intigued, another interminable episode of whinery made me lose any sympathy I might have had for any of the players involved. This is the first book I failed to finish in nearly 14 years"
2,Started out great...,I liked the first half of this book but feel that it got waylayed in the second half. I am glad that I listened to it on tape rather then taking the time to read it. I lost intrest at the pivital point of the book (won't say and spoil it for the people who have not read it) and just never got drawn back in.
3,People's Park Redux,"Flashback is a well established device in books and movies. Today its use is trite. But Turow uses it as an expedient to reveal changes of character rather than development of plot. Sure the failings of 30 years ago still influence the actions of today. Yet, people can change. Can a sinner become a saint? It probably depends on the collective bias of one era compared with another. Turow is a fine writer and frequently presents a beautiful descriptive phrase. The problem with this particular effort is that none of the characters gain much sympathy from the reader. Mass Freudian identity crises are not enough to hold your attention. It is easy to put the book aside, and an effort to pick it up again. It would be interesting if Turow used a nom de plume for his next foray. Expectations seem too high and too narrow under his current authorship for him to achieve anything deemed ""original"""
1,What the heck was that all about?,"I've read all his books, and this was a major disappointment. I got the feeling he was trying to saysomething, like look what we were like in the 60's and look how far we've come. And? It would have been more effectiveas two books, one about the 60's and one about a murder in the 90's. It just sort of petered out at the end. Such bad food and such large portions."
1,A disappointment.,I have read Scott Turow before and had high expectations of a great read. Presumed Innocent was a 5 star mystery and unputdownable. This boring book took me twice as long to finish and failed my expectations miserably.
1,I really hate to do this fella's,"I hate to bring down an average like this, but my opinion is just as valid.Why do YOU like ELO? The sassy pop? The layered vocals? The hooks? The futuristic themes? The out of this world vibe that can only be hand delivered to your heart via the great Jeff Lynne? If you answered YES to these questions, you too should stay away from this cd. Perhaps come back to it after you have purchased all others and have money to throw away.Ok, there is one great song. The song ""10538 Overture"". However, I already had that on a compilation making this cd a near total loss. Queen of the Hours is almost good.I do realise that this disc is ""pre ELO"" in a sense, being that Jeff's vision isn't quite in place and is shared with Mr. Woods, however, that doesn't make this any more bearable to actually listen to. I still do not understand why Overture turned out the way it did and all the rest just didn't even come close to that quality."
5,A World of comfort for the soul.,"I had been sober and in recovery for two years ,when i hit a very rough spot in my life . A friend and fellow recoverer gave me this small but huge book of knowledge.It brought me such great comfort and peace that i would dearly love to share it with so many others ."
2,Whats the fuss?,"I thought this movie was boring. Not going to go in depth of the synopsis, as morgoth has highlighted that in his review. Yeah there's action and training scenes but the story was weak. I was not the least bit drawn into the movie nor the main lead. Dont get me wrong, Cliff Lok can move and is very agile. I liked the interviews in the extra section more than I liked the movie, if that should tell you something. Even if the picture was better or if the subs were redone and not burnt in, I dont think this movie could have improved. Ko Fei couldn't save this flick for me either. This is among the least of my favorite Rarescope releases."
5,A Fitting Tribute,"I first heard this entire album while standing at a listening station in a record store. I couldn't stop listening to it. Ms. Nyolo's voice is light and mesmerizing, and her songs held me from beginning to end. The first cut, ""Tribu"", begins with her deft vocals in her native tongue of Eton (Cameroon) over the whoosh of ocean waves. It is delightful. Ms. Nyolo wrote all the songs, which range from the celebration of the birth of a friend's child (Shana), to tributes to prodigal sons (Ndongo) to observations on love and womanhood. The rhythmic tunes are powered by handclaps and guitar riffs that flow like water. The songs are foreign and exotic, yet soothing and familiar. I LOVE this CD."
2,Sounds like music from a kindergarten,The music is done too straight-up. Sounds like a presentation for a kindergarten class. Disappointed in the presentation.
5,A Joel S Goldsmith Legend,"I don't know why this title is listed under Eileen Bowden. She wrote two short paragraphs in the Foreword, but didn't write the book. That said, however, as any book by Joel S Goldsmith is a 5-star lesson, this book is no exception.What are 'Metaphysical Notes?', I wondered.In this book, we are guided, gradually, into the realization of where we've been, and where we're going in our journey of Oneness with God. The publisher has done an excellent job in compilation of Joels' notes that will be a blessing to all who read the book. Of particular interest is the Question and Answer section.I have so many of Goldsmith's books I could open a Goldsmith store. He was a mentor to me after discovering 'The Art of Spiritual Healing' in 1982.Gail Gupton, Author: The 31-Day Diet of Spiritual Enlightenment and Seekers of Truth"
1,EDITED AND ALTERED,"This is a wonderful early book of Joel S. Goldsmith. The original was a classic for any serious student. If you are a casual reader of Joel, then this book will be fine for you. However, if you are a student of The Infinite Way, you will need to look for the original version, before publishers changed the content."
5,A DARING book!,"This book is a must read for anyone daring enough to check their social programing at the door and think for themselves! Firestone pins her readers eyes open and makes them take a hard and scrutinizing look at the nuclear family structure. Her book is more daring now than ever as we enter an age in which the ""post-nuclear"" family emerges and technological advances such as ""in vitro fertilisation"" become a common reality rather than the stuff of science fiction. Even though this book was written in the 1970's it was far ahead of its time because of the insights and solutions it offered into the abolishment of a patriarchal caste system which still exists today. Her ideas on childhood as a social construct will have you shaken up! Down with childhood indeed, Shulamith Firestone's book will definitely get the wheels turning up there!!!"
4,Amazon's free super saver shipping SUCKS,"I purchased this text for one of my classes. I chose amazon's super saver shipping while buying the book. It took ages for the item to arrive!! By the time it arrived my class had already covered a lot of stuff that I had a real hard time to catch up with.This super saver shipping really sucks! It takes as many as 5-6 days for amazon to get the item out if one chooses super saver shipping. This makes no sense. When you are providing this super saver option you should be conscientious about how it would best serve your customer.I must say though, I have no complaint about the item."
4,FOR THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW THREE 6 MAFIA,"You for sure remember this guy, K-Rock is one of the tightest rappers to come out of Memphis. On Three 6 albums such as Prophet Posse and Ch. 2 World Domination he shined, I was really excited to hear this cd. It features Labelmate Indo G and a few not so known artist such as Pistol, Destineal and Steph. If you remember who K-rock is, your not even readin this cause your already ordering it. His quick flow and amazing lyrics are awesome on this album, he icludes all the lyrics he did with Three 6 Mafia and Tommy Wright iii. While listen to this I figured out there is a huge story behind this album, GOTTA CHECK IT OUT, It even has a Three 6 Mafia sound to it, I gave it 4 stars, cause there was a 1 or 2 not so good song, But I'm thinkin now 5 stars, It's Phat2def for sure, (Includes bonus track off Saint Nicks new album Ft. K-rock). Ya'll Know what time it is, Order this cd NOW, The outro on this cd is even slick."
4,RARE CD FROM MEMPHIS VET!,"2000 RELEASE FEAT.DESTINEAL,NICK SCARFO,PISTOL.VERY RARE!I HAVE 1 LEFT FOR SALE FOR DECENT PRICE.****EMAIL**** FOR THIS ONE AND LIST OF 100`S OF OTHER RARE,OUT OF PRINT CDS AND TAPES!"
2,not as good as expected.. simply put...,"the snippets are basically the highlight of the album. the album ain't that good, and i wasn't impressed. K-Rock and T-Rock were the most talented 2 out of Prophet Posse, but damn, K-Rock has fell off... T-Rock is just on another level.."
3,"nice cardio, but not in rhythm","I agree with the other reviews of this product that a) it is a great cardio workout (it is very reasonable in length) and b) that the music doesn't necessarily match the moves, and it is very frustrating when she says something like ""feel the music!"" I am a decent dancer in general and know how to do bhangra actually, but this workout dvd/video makes me feel inept!!!"
4,One of my favorite videos,"Ever since the first time I did the Masala Bhangra workout I was hooked. It's so different than anything else, and it's so much fun. This video is good for beginners. My mother-in-law has a bad back and knees and she could do all the moves without pain. Jain is very energetic, but she doesn't give you much time to learn the moves. Don't give up - you'll catch on after doing the video a couple of times. The reason I only gave this video 4 stars is because her timing is off for most of the video. The moves don't go with the beat, and it made me a little crazy when I was first starting to learn it. I never dred doing this video."
3,Good...but not good instruction,"As a workout, I found that this video provided plenty of cardio. However, if you're actually looking to learn bhangra, this may be a poor introduction. The instructor doesn't really teach or break down any of the moves so it's pretty hard to learn for those of us who are not familiar with bhangra or aren't naturally endowed with dancing talents. Oh, and one thing that really annoyed me was that the moves didn't move with the music (if it could be called that, since it was the same background track going the entire video)."
2,Not as advertised,"I expected to have a great ""hip hop"" style workout from this DVD, but I don't get that. Plus the quality of the DVD was so bad that in the middle of the session, it went back to ""warm up"" session again. And the picture will not stop shaking during the whole 45 minutes. Very disappointed!"
2,Bhangra,"I did not like this one nearly as much as I liked Volume 1. Some of the moves in this video were already covered in the first one and in her All-Star Workouts routine (which I wish was also available on DVD). Additionally, the production quality was not as good as it should have been. I will be getting Volume 3 eventually, however, because I am interested in learning as much Bhangra as I can."
3,It's ok for a change of pace.,"When I get bored with my routine, I like to do a little bhangra. This dvd is not bad at all, but not great like I thought it would be. It did seem more repetitive than most dance/exercise routines. It will make you sweat and she is exhuberant. I worked up a good sweat. I just was hoping there was a ""little more to it."" Amazon delivery and any interaction was terrific. I always trust orders from Amazon."
4,"Very different, very fun!","I bought #2, Hip Hop style based on earlier Amazon reviews. Its great! I didn't find it too fast at all, I have purchased two Hip Hop DVDs before this and Jain's instructions were so much easier to learn and follow than classical Hip Hop. She almost always return to her ""Basic"" move, which allows you to catch up if you fall behind.The moves are not complicated (although the head wiggle isn't as easy as it looks!) so by the 3rd time through most people should be able to do basic Bhangra smoothly. And her sequences make for easy transitions.Lastly, I have bad knees - had a meniscus repair a few years ago from over aggressive skiing. So I had to give away a DVD by a ""celebrity"" hip hop dance person because I couldn't do any of the low moves or squats. This DVD does not make my knees hurt. So its a keeper, especially if you aren't as limber as you used to be."
4,"fun, dance workout","really fun, dance workout if you like this type of music. the instructor shows you the basic moves then puts it all together for routines that move quickly but are still good for a beginner. somewhat mid-DVD, she walks through the steps so that is one thing to look for. it is a an ok workout but a lot of fun and gets you moving and who knows maybe you will learn a dance step or two! enjoy!"
5,Fantastic!!!,"This video is so awesome. I HATE work out videos, they are always boring and stupid...But this one is great! I worked up a good sweat and didn't even realise it! I have always been fond of the indian style of dancing and the instructor makes it easy to follow along. This is the best work out video ever,I completely suggest buying it! (even though it isn't the most economically priced) This video would be really fun to do with a friend too!"
1,Boring.....,I guess...it is said that meeting ones hero and then learning what they are REALLY about can change ones life...for the good....or not. Being proud of Mr. Blass being from Indiana...our most famous designer....it was sad to read more about his twisted personal life instead of the things that really inspired him to become what he was...a great designer. I met him as a kid at the Herron School of Art when I was in H.S. and got to ask him questions about fashion design...he was cordial in that setting....but I could tell he was less than interested in answering a 16 year old kids questions.....Wish the book had been as outstanding as the legacy of design he left behind.....
4,BLASS From The Past,"The narrative lacks intimacy that typically one would find in a memoir. Bill Blass is very conscious of what he is writing, he presents what he wants as an image. It is in no way written in a blasé manner which would have been much more telling and intimate.There is very little personal feelings or personal thoughts in the dialogue which I am greatly disappointed about. However it is Bill's legacy and he is entitled to that. I'm not sure why this book was written, possibly for people that may have known him or as an explanation for some of his actions. It is very detailed about fashion and the life of a fashion designer and seventh avenue and the business but defiantly must less personal.This book is great not because it is Bill's memoir but because it is a reflection of a time in fashion that no longer exists. It is a preservation of American history and the American Dream is woven within it.Blass is a classic American icon that should not be forgotten."
4,Interesting book for fashionistas,"My only regret from reading this book is that I will never get to meet Mr. Blass. What a really swell guy he must have been. Many situations he describes are laugh-out-loud funny--particularly his encounter with the mysterious ""Ms. Fitzgerald"" at Bonwit's. And just to set the record straight--my mother grew up in McMinnville TN and knew Miss Sedberry of the Sedberry Hotel--it wasn't a brothel!!"
2,Makes AutoCad harder than it is.,"I would not recommend this book. There are other Autocad books better at teaching autocad. If you want a good book on AutoCad try ""AutoCAD 2004 and AutoCAD LT 2004: No Experience Required""."
3,Kirk goes it alone to save the Federation.,"In Star Trek there are different levels of ""saving"" that the characters must accomplish:1. Save yourself or crew mates2. Save your ship3. Save a planet4. Save the Federation5. Save the Galaxy6. Save the UniverseRenegade is the save your friends and several planets scenario."
3,"2nd album starts out good, but suffers in the end.","2nd album by Eddie Money ""Life For The Taking"" #17 in 1978. This album started off fast with the sturdy album rocker ""Life For The Taking"", followed by ""Can't Keep A Good Man Down"", #63 a solid rocker, ""Nightmare"", is a strong number, Eddie and Jimmy Lyons at their best, ""Gimme Some water"", a classic rock staple, it gets it's due, a good song. ""Maybe I'm A Fool"", #22, AM single, strings and sax. And the good fast paced tune with good guitar ""Love The Way You Love Me"". This album might of been a little harder edged than the first, but the last 3 songs kind of grag it down. *** 1/2 overall. 1980 brought us the mediocre ""Playing For Keeps""."
4,big anthem rock songs,"this is eddie money at a creative peak! gimme some water sounds so awesome driving in a car , it's a powerful beginning, middle and end story.. it rocks! ( the opening is the key ) life for the taking is a great song too! eddie plays this song at all of his concerts now and is one of his most popular true life hits! can't keep a good man down! we hear this in all of our daily conversations with people we know! i buy the paper every day but i ain't got time to read ... there ain't no jobs in there for me anyway! we all have said that verse right? maybe i'm a fool has a disco twist and is a nice tune , rock n roll the place is about eddie singing for his fans and partying! the great thing about eddie money is all of his big songs have a real life story!"
3,old school,I bought this on cd since I wanted to hear it again my copy used to be on vinyl. Has some good classic songs.
5,A Second Great Eddie Money Album,"LIFE FOR THE TAKING is Eddie Money's second great album in a row. It contains several great songs, but the standouts are ""Can't Keep A Good Man Down"" and the outlaw anthem ""Gimme Some Water."" A few songs are obvious filler, but there are enough good ones to make this a 5-star album."
4,Need met Quickly and economical,"Very solid quality product, it cut very satisfactory, very high finish on product and extra sharp ground cutting edges eliminated any tear out of material it was used on."
2,Sooooo disappointed,"Initially, I was excited to read this book. Though not a Sherlock Holmes fan per se, I LOVED Ahab's Wife and am always on the lookout for books that take common ""folklore"" and look at it from another perspective (e.g. Wicked by Maguire). Anyway, though the beginning dragged, eventually I got into this book and was happy to read along to its conclusion. But at the end (which luckily came quickly - a fast read), I said to myself, ""so what?"". There were themes of feminism and magic and friendship that weren't well-developed. But I guess that is good - otherwise the book would have been longer and I might have just put it down."
2,The Opposite of Masterpiece,"This is, by no means, a good or great pastiche. And, without question, it isn't even in the same league as much-finer and more accomplised efforts by the likes of Michael Chabon, Mitch Cullin, and Laurie R. King. Even Caleb Carr's somewhat lackluster Holmes novel is a more valid effort than this one. Masterpiece? No, sorry. However, if one reads this novel without any knowledge of Holmes, Watson, the Conan Doyle canon, or the handful of fine Sherlock pastiches that are out there, it probably wouldn't be so bad. Otherwise, you'd be better served to engage yourself in Laurie R. King's very enjoyable Mary Russell series, Mitch Cullin's haunting and beautifully written A SLIGHT TRICK OF THE MIND, Nicolas Meyer's classic THE SEVEN PERCENT SOLUTION, and Michael Chabon's wonderfully realized novella THE FINAL SOLUTION."
4,Best sherlockian Pastiche so far.,"I just got this book yesterday at the bookstore. I thought of putting it back at first. I'm a devoted sherlockian, and I always saw those new Sherlock Holmes books as pathetic, even sacreligious (I know i get carried away, but I once saw one called ""Sherlock Holmes vs. Dracula."" Get my drift?). But I got this anyway, and I must admit it's quite good. Sure, it's not Doyle, but one of the better ones. But, it's still a little to modernly feminist and bizzare."
5,A clear view of a better alternative for our business life,"The ""Real Power"" is a wonderfully clear interpretation of an ancient and wise book. The authors describe useful and sensitive ways to deal with the everyday events of business life. The excerpts from the Tao Te Ching that open each chapter are well worth memorizing. The short, concise chapters quickly enlighten the logic of the quotes and reflect a human view of leadership with real life applications to enhance company's and leader's ability to strengthen peoples performances. This book has reinforced my belief that a self centered, cut throat business approach breeds contempt and mistrust and ultimately destroys the satisfaction we should gain from our work and our lives. Mr. Autry and Mr. Mitchell have given me an alternative to the ugly, self centered and rude way of doing business. I highly recommend this book and suggest it be read with an open mind. Keep ""Real Power"" on your desk and carry it's wisdom with you every day."
1,Colors do not match scale,"I ran out of InstaTest 3 test strips and purchased the Aqua Chek 3 locally (not through Amazon). The colors on the strips do not match the scale on the bottle. Once this bottle is depleted, I am going back to InstaTest 3 strips."
4,Saving the summer for winter days,"We used this little item to save our vegetables from our garden. I shopped around and this was the most flexible for the best price. It has lived up to our expectations: any size bag, from 1/4 cup to 2 gallon with the ability to use the vacuum for dry items or not for liquids. The instructions could have been a little clearer. I did have to read them twice before really getting what they said, but overall this was a great buy!"
3,Vacuum Sealer not as powerful as I hoped it would be.,This is a good product but the vacuum was not very strong.
1,virtually worthless,Do not buy this. The vacuum is not strong enough and the plastic too flimsy. You will get better results by squeezing the air out of a zip lock bag by hand.
1,Wrong product,"Even though the cd case I was sent was for Moonpies for Misfits, the cd inside was a different album from Hot Water Music; therefore, I sent it back. Would love the have the correct cd if someone actually has it."
1,switcheroony,"This is not a very interesting CD and particularly because it has the same name and cover art as a different CD. The other CD has many wonderful tunes, tunes of Francis Lemarque, Juliette Greco, and some interesting modern groups, but there was no Volume indication to say it wasn't the same CD.There should be volumn indication.I received the CD quickly, but very disappointing."
2,Not bad... More Traditional,"This wasn't quite what I expected when I bought it. Labeled ""The Greatest Songs Ever"" I suppose I was expecting some great, contemporary songs. This CD encapsulates a very traditional side of France and the tempo is quite slow. Just be sure you listen to it first to know what you're getting into."
5,Nice option to plate joiner.,I bought an inexpensive plate joiner for a moderate sized project. It was not well designed and not useable. I returned it and purchased this set for my router. It was a very good decision. The router provided more accurate depth and horizontal alignment than the plate jointer. I also was allowed to create longer slots than the buscuit required. This made my joints very easy to assemble.
2,Kawaipunahele Remix,"I am a big fan of Keali`i Reichel's music. I have all his albums so I wanted this single when I saw it. I do not care for it. The driving beat is uncharacteristic of even his more up tempo songs. His vocals on some verses sound as if they were being broadcast through a very bad speaker. Keali`i Reichel is an extremely talented songwriter, composer, and singer. I think the ""Kawaipunahele Remix"" was a misguided attempt to sound more contemporary. Keali`i, I say stick with your tried and true; life experience, issues you are passionate about, ballads, chants, and traditional Hawaiian songs.The original version of ""Kawaipunahele is a very enchanting and beautiful love song. I recommend you get the album entitled ""Kawaipunahele"" instead. Along with the title song, there are many beautiful songs."
1,Wrong CD,"I am very unhappy with thebookgrove. There was no picture of the CD and it did not label it as a ""Disco Version"". I opened it to try and see if it was tolerable, therefore could not return it. I was told I got what I ordered. Disco Version was not advertised. It sounds awful! It destroys Keali'i beautiful island music. I have never had a problem ordering anything online until now. I will donate it to a local thrift store."
1,Was not for me.,"This product was not for me. After taking it for about one week, I noticed that I was getting anxious. I gave a few to a friend and she felt the same way. If there is one thing I don't want to feel is anxiety."
3,Still Assessing,"I have not made a definite decision yet on how I like this product. I have only been taking the product a little over 2 months. The label advises that you may need to take the product in excess of 3 months for the full benefits to be felt. I will be reordering and continuing the product for a second trimester. If at that time I don't achieve optimum results, I will discontinue use of the product."
3,a book with a lot of information from experience,"I have read the book 3 times, that I am the the first grandson of the author himself. It is very emotional and strong and at the same time can have you wondering what will be happening next later on in other chapters. Dr. Jefferson Wiggins has done an exceptional job writing about racial diversity in the '60's the book was also adopted by President William ""Bill"" Clinton for his committee on racial diversity."
3,Easier to 'Roll your own',"This is Castor Oil and Olive oil. The purpose of a preshave is to soften heavy beards for a closer and more comfy shave. This can be achieved for a fraction of the price with the following ingredients:Castor oil - This is the emollient (beard softener)Olive Oil - This is the surfactant(allows the oils to 'cling' to your face)Lavender Oil - This is used as a scent and anti-friction and anti-burn oil.The first are available from your supermarket and the latter from your pharmacist.Mix them as follows:For 2 1/2 spoonfuls of castor oil add one spoonful of Olive Oil, then add one drop of lavander oil.Depending on your skin type and beard growth, you may not even need a shaving cream with this, and you can buy a nice bottle at your local gift shop (i got a 100ml blue one with a glass stopper for six bucks). Should work out at around two bucks for 50 ml and it works a treat.Finished shaving? then use the above as an after shave balm (skin calmer), again works great!!"
4,Solid product,"This definitely makes shaving a smoother process. I wouldn't recommend it for cartridge razors, as it will likely clog them up. But it works great for my safety razors.Because of its high price, I don't actually apply it everywhere. But I definitely use it on more sensitive areas, such as around my mouth and Adams Apple."
2,Good but expensive for what really is!!,This stuff works really good but if you make it yourself is cheaper and better!!
1,Very disappointed,"This product is labeled as being unscented. That is not true. It has a very, very strong unpleasant odor. I try to use as many fragrant free products as I can. This one is mislabeled. I am sorry I spent that much money on something that I will never use ."
3,Not really that usefull,save the 22 bucks... your shave will be the same as if you didnt use the pre shave oil... i do get cut using it also...
2,It's OK - Not to RAVE too much about this,"Smells more like ""castor oil"" (rather than sandalwood) which is a primary ingredient. I compared the result with applying castor oil instead of this and the result is almost same ! It's a question of whether to pay so much for a small bottle of castor oil - I would have rated this higher atleast if the fragrance was living upto the name on the bottle."
1,Not because of the product.,"I ordered a three piece set. I never got the pre- shave oil. The company Art of Shaving ship me two shave creams and the after shave instead.The set was shave cream, pre-shave oil and after shave cream. I can't forgive a company that can't put the right products for shipment to make up the set they advertise. This is easy to do."
2,Not worth the price!,"Its ok but definitely not worth buying because of the price.It does not do anything awesome to your face before shaving. Yes, smells good and a nice brand but not worth buying it because their may be better products available if you are ready to spend so much money.I will not buy it again."
1,WAY OVER-PRICED!,"I like the product, but these folks are GOUGING. You can see from the other reviews that you can MAKE this stuff for pennies! Don't be fooled by fancy packaging and retail stores in upscale malls. It's clear that the EMPEROR has NO clothes. These guys would do fine if they cut their prices by 80%, but until then, don't waste your money. The product is GOOD but priced ridiculously!"
2,Gives me acne,"Oil feels low-grade, and it gave me acne until I stopped using it.I recommend looking elsewhere for higher quality face oils."
3,"Okay, but too thick and not slick enough for my tastes","I am regular user of the Art of Shaving shaving creams, but I find their pre-shave oils to be too thick. The end result for me is a slightly tacky/sticky feeling on my beard, not a slick lubricated surface."
2,Unnecessary and overpriced,"I've shaved with and without the pre-shave oil for over a month. I notice no difference what so ever. I was hoping this would make my razor glide a bit better, and it definitely didn't help with that. I do like the after shave lotion though."
2,Don't waste your money....much better pre-shaves available.,"If you like the smell of AOS Sandalwood, that is about the only thing going for this product. Really there is more scent coming from the other oils in the product as compared to the sandalwood essential oil. The other thing is this is an oily product that is thick and sticky. If you like to wetshave with water rinses in your sink, you can bet this will leave an oily very sticky ring on the sink after only one shave.I recommend using Proraso Pre as it is just as effective, picks the hairs up better for a shave, and rinses very cleanly. Do a pre-shave for effectiveness not scent as any scent is not going to make it through the soap lathering, rinse and resultant aftershave anyway.I've also used non-lathering shaving creams like Kiss My Face ad Cremo Creme as pre-shave alternatives with very good results as well."
3,Bottle leaks slightly,I have bought many bottles of this product and they all leak slightly. This is only a problem when traveling but then it is a nuisance because it requires putting the bottle in a plastic bag.
4,surprisingly impressed,"I was on a business trip and realized I forgot my shaving cream when I saw a free sample of this in the airport lounge. After I used the three products (pre shave oil, shaving cream, and after shave) my skin felt amazing and I had a really close shave. I usually don't shave on the weekend because shaving during the week is hard on my face even with changing razor blades frequently. The only thing I think made the difference was the pre shave oil."
5,AOS Pre Shave Oil,"I love the oil. Combined with a fine brush, shaving is almost pleasurable. Taking it an extra step, I use $5 coffee mug warmer to warm the oil prior to application. Heaven in the AM."
2,Works but is too much of a mess to clean up,"This stuff does indeed give me a closer shave and helps cut down on razor bumps. That being said though, it leaves a nasty sticky film on everything it touches from skin to razor to brush to sink. I guess I'll use it when I'm doing something that I want a really close shave but it is way too much of a mess for daily use."
3,Why did the author have to mention the Mideast?,"I really enjoyed this book until about halfway through, when discussing some torture equipment, the author threw in a comment about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. No other politial comments, no other mention of any other countries' torture practices in the entire book, but he had to say that Isreal had invented this device to torture Palestinians. Did nobody else notice this? I would have thrown this book away except that I had gotten it from the library."
1,The author should have researched Chinese adoption first,"This book misrepresents Chinese adoption beyond recognition. As a parent of a daughter adopted from China, I have found the Chinese government to be reliable and predictable. The situation described in this book is ridiculous and offensive. Perhaps Mr. Ball wanted to seem contemporary by seizing on the current trend of international adoption. His ignorance of the subject is staggering."
3,Cutting edge this is not don't buy for over 2nd 3rd grade,"I just bought this at Staples, (a sort of impulse purchase) I homeschool and always look for extras to do on computer. I must say I just installed the Reading and am a little disappointed. This is not cutting edge at all. Some good basic games and mediocre graphics and a horribly annoying sound bytes for right and wrong. Thank goodness you can turn the music off. There is no way to choose grade or ability levels. I think my K will get the most out of it but I would say the reading is not beyond a 3rd grade level. I don't hold much hope for the rest of the cds."
4,Yeah Baby!,"This is an interestin' visual concept. Woman on Woman. The photos are very tasteful, yet provocative - hence the title! I would recommend it if you're into that sort of thing. (I know I am!) You might even hang it at work and see what kind of responses you get ;)"
4,Both the story and the pictures are whimsical,This is a fun book! Don't forget to study the illustrations thoroughly. The scene in the doctor's office is worth the price of the book all by itself.
4,Still Pertinent,"This is a fascinating insider's tale about the history and ""business"" of opinion polls, particularly those involving politics in the USA. It's a bit dated, having been written and published in the mid-1990s, but it's still an important and pertinent book, offering an illuminating look at polling and the mistakes that are often made by these so-called ""experts"". This is a must read for anyone who has doubts and reservations about the accuracy and ramifications of the ""science"" of political polling."
3,"Interesting, but terribly dry",A good book for anyone who enjoys the mechinations of the political process. Moore's writing style doesn't lend itself toward a quick read. It doesn't do much to separate itself from the pack.
1,I wish I coud give this NO star,"I was VERY open-minded to watching the movie but everything from the pilot, cast, directing, and everything else, the movie was not good at all."
1,Hate It,"The movie IS TERRIBLE!!!!!! Poor writing, poor casting, poor acting, poor directing, poor camera shots and filming. I literally tried to sit throughout the entire movie but I couldn't."
2,Really!?,"I saw this movie late one night when I couldn't sleep and there was nothing else on. This movie is horrible. As one commenter stated the pot of this movie was ridiculous! It was full of stereotypes and asinine clichés. The black women were portrayed as loud, manipulative, and vindictive while the white woman was portrayed as meek, too understanding, and easy to control. This movie was predictable and undeveloped.I actually like the actors and actresses but they could do nothing for the poorly developed script and the script did nothing for showcasing their talent.I'm giving it two stars because it did entertain me during my time of restlessness and Marcus looked great shirtless."
1,the worse!!!,The story had potential..but the roles were stereotypical and the characters were all over the place. The roles were superficial and it was hard to empathize with the characters. Good story but poorly acted.
5,Remarkable/Relatable,I saw this movie last weekend and it instantly attracted my attention. A Black Man at the very bedside of his ailing Black Wife. He Only gave up when he was told there was no hope of her recovery. To lose the Love of Your Life is undescribable as well as unimaginable. You NEVER stop Loving him/her or for that matter being in Love with that Special Someone. But sad to say you must go on with your life as he did. But in the end TRUE LOVE prevailed. I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone because in some way we all can relate whether We Do or We Did.
4,Cherie Johnson is hidden in plain sight...,"This is one those ""Let the movie make your nite"" kind of dvd... 1ST the casting was ""outstanding"", It was an who's who assembly of supporting actors.., Each carried their own weight... The script & budget needed some tweaking for those who like to haggle over those things.., But the actors brought the story thru, everyone was likeable, I'm sorry it took this long to add to my collection... Cherie Johnson is hidden in plain sight..."
3,Confused,I thought the movie was okay but it confused me a lot. The start of the film was really emotional and seemed quite serious but then contradicted itself with the rest of the storyline. I couldnt tell its genre and a lot of what happened and how characters reacted to things seemed pretty unrealistic. Still was just about enough to keep me entertained though.
2,Kathy Kaehler Total Fitness Workout,"I too, was disappointed in this video. The excercies are mundane and I feel bad saying this, but I have hard time looking at her. She has more of a masculine body and actually does not look like she is in shape. Personally if I am going to follow an instructor I would like them to look better than I do. I have recently purchased several DVD workout videos from a variety of instructors that I really like alot. I know I will never play this one unless it is absolutely necessary."
2,Total Fitness Workout,"I really enjoyed the part I was able to do which was around 30 minutes of the DVD, then as soon as the last part of the program begins, the DVD freezes. I have never been able to go further. The DVD was defective. I was disappointed in getting it in that condition."
1,Worst EVER!!!!,I workout everyday for about a half hour somedays cardio some days just legs and abs. I am in fit but not disgustingly. I felt that the workout started off good but was boring and she talks to you like your a child when she explains stuff. I hated this and am very angry I spent the money because I will probably never do it again!!Even though she is annoying (you can put you on mute) Denise Austin tapes are great!!!
4,Kathy Kaehler Basics - Total Fitness Workout,"I think this is a great ""basics"" workout video. The segments are 5 minutes each and hit all of the trouble spots....arms, legs, abs, butt and cardio. They are simple and can be done in your own home with the only need being a couple of weights. I first saw and taped a week long 5 minute series of exercises by Kathy Kaehler featured on the Today show, which I used religiously until my husband accidently taped over it. This tape is very much in line with that series.I would recommend it for anyone looking for an all around basic workout. It really works for me."
3,Hawthorne Heights gone softer,"If only you were lonely is definitely different from Silence in Black and White. It's a lot softer, more mainstream sounding. They threw all of the screaming parts at the end of the songs, whereas in Silence in Black and White it was mixed throughout the whole song. If you wanted Hawthorne Heights to go more ""hardcore"", this CD is definitely not for you. The vocals are good, but a lot of the songs sound alike. All in all, I think they could have done better."
4,Nice edition,"Coming off of the ""vibe high"" from their first album, Silence in Black and White (which was fabulous), I played the first track of If Only You Were Lonely. Wow, what a sophomore edition.Follow me for a second. Their first album, Silence, was like a young choir boy with smoothness. In Lonely, it's like that same boy smoked a couple cigarettes, then went back to the choir.Hawthorne Heights has matured, and for the better. Their sound is edgier and more agressive. I was at first shocked with this, but have then come to enjoy the sound i was at first shocked to hear.the duel album cover is a marketing ploy that gives one no advantages or diadvantages for buying A or B.Exact same songs.Overall, great sound and mature lyrics make this album. I love Hawthorne Heights, and the only reason i gave this CD 4/5 stars is because the disc is still growing on me."
4,"Not bad, HH, not bad.","This CD is OK. It's not bad. It's worth getting if you liked the first album, just don't expect the first one all over again. It is different. And I know this is a short review and is bound to get tons of negative reviews, but what is it with Victory plugging on ever commercial I see for this album the fact that we need to buy BOTH LAYOUTS TO GET THE WHOLE STORY! I like the Layout B that I got just fine thank you. No need to get another one. The CD: B+BTW, the CD artwork is freakin beautiful on my layout (I don't know if all the discs are the same or if they are particular to the particular layout). It looks similar to the little girl on the Silence in Black & White case."
3,"Great Songs, HOWEVER . . .","This is a great sampling of ELO's early and mid-70s career, before they got slicker and hugely popular. But why oh why did they have to ruin this CD by only putting in the horrible radio-length edit of their wonderful 8-minutes-plus magnum opus, ""Roll Over Beethoven?"" This is one of the great goes-on-forever jams in rock and roll and clearly it would have fit on the CD. What's really embarassing is that my VINYL version (you know, vinyl, more limiting technology, can't put as much on the record)DOES have the full-length song! What a waste . . ."
3,OK,"They are okay. They tear sometimes when you pull them out of the container, but they are not flushable. You would think being that thin they would flush down the toilet. They are not moist enough to last long in one of those wipe warmers. The last 25 or so wipes got carcoaled in my wipe warmer because they dried out. Over all ""okay"", but Huggies are better. The best part, my baby's bottom did not break out."
2,Slimy film,"I've used these wipes on my son and I'm displeased with the residue Pampers wipes leave behind. It's slimy, and though it might dry, I have to wonder how that effects the baby's skin. Nevermind it being cross. The wipe was moist, but thin as some value brands you can purchase. Not good for my money."
1,Similarly irritated,"Beware: Pampers Sensitive Wipes are not the same as ""Pampers Sensitive"" -- the Pampers Sensitive Wipes contain citric acid, which can be an irritant, particularly for younger babies."
1,This toy is horrible!,"I have taken it away from my daughter! She has such an attitude and is so disrespectful. I wouldn't allow my child to speak that way, so why would I allow her toys? It has the valley girl attitude, saying ""Hello"" and ""Excuse me"" with great negativity. She just has an attitude in general. My mom tried to get her the car also, which after hearing tires screach she says ""Watch where you're going"" with the same nasty attitude. Horrid, just horrid. I dont see how parents can let their kids play with this, then again, people let their girls play with brats dolls. Come on parents! Is this how you want you children acting?"
3,Pixel chix,Really fun to play ( even for parents). Would have liked it better if the options for play didn't start over every time it is turned off for a while. The options only increase the more it is played with. I don't really like my daughter playing with a hand held toy for hours.
3,"Great sound, painful to wear","Bought these headphones when the KSC-50 were discontinued. Same excellent sound as the over-the-ear model, but with a behind-the-ear band.<br /><br />That band grips your head like a vise and puts pressure on the base of your skull like some sort of shiatsu torture device. I ended up snapping the plastic in an effort to stretch them out.<br /><br />Shame to have broken such a nice-sounding pair of headphones, but they really left me no choice. Now I hang them on my ears and let the mess of wires and snapped neckband do what they will. People feel sorry for me and my ghetto headphones, but I don't need their pity!<br /><br />I'd recommend the KSC-75 from Koss instead. My wife stole mine for her MP3 player and raves about them."
3,the agony & ectasy,"Great sound, excellent bass response. Some distortion with quieter passages. <br />They are unforgiveably uncomfortable! Did Koss test this product on humans before selling them to the public."
5,Best headphones for exercising ever,"Okay,I'm an ""audio enthusiast"" borderline audiophile. I have some pretty nice headphones from Grado, Alessandro, Beyerdynamic, Etymotic, etc. These are the only headphones I can tolerate working out with. The sound is as good as it gets for a headphone at this price point. They will stay in place no matter what you're doing. They will be slightly uncomfortable for the first few hours that you wear them, but the band will conform to your head over time and then you won't even notice them. The newer versions with the earclips are nowhere near as good because they don't stay secure for exercising. Outside of grado/alessandro I feel like these are the best sounding supra aural headphones period.Koss, if you're listening, please start making these again!!!!!The downside to these is that the headband will brake if you put too much pressure on it. I have two pairs right now just for this reason."
3,Ditto the others,"As others have said, great sounding headphones using Koss' famous drivers (found on KSC35 for example). 'Don't know who the genius was who designed the headband, however. Way too tight and even if not tight, the design makes it difficult to lean one's head back without creating even more pressure. C'mon Koss...these dogs don't hunt!!!PS You CAN improve the tightness issue by submerging the plastic band in a pan of boiling water (hanging the actual headphones up out of the water obviously) for several minutes, and then CAREFULLY putting them on your head. They will cool to a far better ""fit"" than before. This was the only way I could make these headphones tolerable..."
4,Accurate and true,"The 99-270 bit set I purchased took a little getting used to. When I first opened the package and studied the profiles, there was no way these bits would match. Or so I thought. After some practice cuts and a little trial and error I was on my way. The bits are of course Freud quality all the way. Mine unfortunately were assembled incorrectly from the factory. (4 Stars) One of the cutting heads on one of the bits was installed up side down. This made for an interesting first cut. After correcting the assembly error, I had no problem making all the parts for a divided light window. You will however, have to use mortises to assemble your project. Overall these are a great addition to my Freud collection. Solid as expected!"
3,Aight,this cd was aight..not the best rappin 4-tay album... it cannot measure with off parole for instance... buy it only if u are fote fan
4,"Significant studies, but significant liturgies?","Bryan Spinks offers a well thought collection of essays about two new liturgies. The essays themselves are as carefully crafted as the liturgies they review and include significant thoughts about the art of worship. Alas, while the Episcopal Church of Scotland once generated the liturgy that became the American Prayer Book, it is doubtful that such lightning will strike twice. The liturgical study in this book is significant. These Scottish liturgies no longer are."
2,inconsistent characterization hurt this book,"My feeling as I read this book was that it COULD have been a great book. It had an interesting story line, an interesting setting, and even the potential for interesting characters but the author portrayed the main character as a mishmash of stupid vs. supposedly clever. She's supposedly this tough as nails prosecutor back in the states - a loner that's been through hard times as a child and yet has become a great lawyer through hard work and intelligence. Then for the practical part of the book, she proceeds to make stupid choices never bothering to think of the consequences while everyone around her gets bumped off. It's as if the author sat down and wrote Lara's background and then disregarded most of it to further the plot of the book. I can't help but feel this book would have done better as a spy/thriller/mystery if it had been given some pointers by Agatha Christie and John Grisham."
2,Knew the killer from his first appearance,"... It's is a quick read. No big Russian words to slow you down. I haven't been in the former Soviet Union, so I can't speak to how accurately the author depicts things since the fall of Communism, but it's easy to see which side of the 60's he was on. The main character, Lara, is sort of like Alex Keaton from Family Ties, but without the personality. The detective, Yuri, reminded me of Sgt Wojo from Barney Miller.As soon the Killer made his/her first appearance, I knew s/he was the one. There's misdirection after that, but it doesn't work.I guess you could say this book is a classic instance of trying to force current, enlightened, multicultural, liberal, post 60s, flowerpower, warm, fuzzy, American values on another culture. Even the defense attorney, Nina, has to be made a minority so the reader can know that she's alright. Throw in a little gay action and some disabled people for window dressing, and there you have it!"
3,Great Beach Book!,"Very readable. Not great literature, but then I wasn't in the mood for that much involvement anyway, so it was a perfect match. Complex enough to keep you wanting to see how it turns out, and well enough written not to irritate me out of enjoying the story. A perfect match for a vacation or a lazy Sunday when I don't want to solve the world's problems - just have a nice long lazy read."
3,"A page turner, but very hard to believe.","Most mysteries are page turners, and this holds enough interest to keep going, but this one lacks a great deal of credibility. The story is definitely far fetched (bad ending)"
2,there oughta be a law,"despite lofty title not a legal thriller. a wonderful opportunity to compare american and soviet and post-communist justice systems is woefully squandered in a sturm und drang saga where the heroine's spunkiness conquers all.566 pages of drivel on the tundra. a real chore to finish, if you don't buy into the mindless escapism."
4,Good story,"This is just a story of two friends. It is not complex but it is a very fun read. It is not written as a catharsis, like into thin air was, it's basically the coolest story your grandpa ever told you."
2,Not completely wireless,"We purchased this item because we needed some of the speakers wireless, however, with this unit they must still be wired to a separate unit that transmits to the stereo."
1,Equipment defective,"The instructions are well written and easily understood. Unfortunately the unit does not work at all. The menu on the Dav500 does not recognize the Sony WAHTSD1 Wireless transmitter when it is plugged into the recepticle in the back.This is particularly upsetting after spending $3,000 for the Bravia 46 inch LCD HDTV and $400 for the DAV500 home entertainment unit."
4,Product performs as expected,The product performs as expected. It was easy to install but took a few adjustments that were not too hard to figure out. It was received in a timely manner in good condition.
2,Nice but not working!,Got it and hooked it up in a few minutes. After it not working at all in the beginning. I unplugged everything from outlets and then plugged back up and it worked fine. Then after two days it stopped. Moved it around and it worked for a few hours. Unplugged again and moved infrared to different spots and still not working. It comes and goes and is only nine feet away from transmitter to receiver.Makes no sense cause it is really making me mad!!!If anyone knows how to correct this issue let me know please!
2,Sony Wireless,Didn't work for me. It's not real clear in the description that it only works for Sony products. I returned it for an LG wireless system that is great.
5,Ontzito,"Mini Spotted Owl Finger Puppet is loads of fun! It's soft, well made, and quite robust. You can put it on your thumb or on any other finger and .... make it come alive!The puppet is made to look like the Mexican Spotted Owl (that can be found in Grand Canyon area), and for us, it's been a travel companion during our stay in the United States, appearing in our photos as a new member of the family :-)"
5,great for reading!,I purchased this finger puppet to use with struggling readers. My students are so excited to read and repeat with this little puppet. Excellent prop!
5,Christmas music,Hennie Bekker's Christmas Spirit CD came in good condition and in a timely fashion. Thanks. I enjoyed the music very much.
4,Great for school kids,Excellent old Norse story. The book reads like one written in the 1950s with sentences that are needlessly convoluted. It will stretch grade schoolers vocabulary and help them to realize that fantasy was being composed before Pokemon. Highly recommend if you want to stretch a child's imagination. You may want to ask your children to draw the various characters in the book or make up their own story.
1,Serious problem: biased toward Dr. Lee,"I have read through this book. The most serious flow is that the authors despised Dr. Wen Ho Lee in some obvious tones. For example, the authors described Dr Lee as a ""mediocre talents with hard work"". If this is the case, how comes he stayed in LANL for almost thirty years. The authors hold a standing point from white ethnicity and obviously deviate from the subjectivity in general. Like his counterparts such as those from New York Times who failed to report the story through a thorough scrutiny, the authors did not undertook a multi-perspective viewpoints over the whole incident. The most significantly, most of his materials are more from sources in the mainstream white people rather from the Chinese or Asian ethnicity."
1,Biased by authors own limitation,How can the authors write a story without knowing the subject? They may know more politics than the case itself.
5,A balanced account from objective investigators,"Stober and Hoffman are professional reporters pursuing the truth, unencumbered by political ambitions or personal vendettas. Their rich descriptions of the many players and settings paint a colorful picture and make this serious drama come alive. I was amazed at so much: from the liberal flow of visitors and information so directly related to our Nation's defense to the bumbling incompetance during the investigation.A must read for an objective and compelling look at this not-so-proud moment in American history."
5,Review from The Economist of London,"The Economist (London, England)Feb. 11, 2002""Dan Stober and Ian Hoffman have produced a lucid, gripping and revealing account of these events in 'A Convenient Spy.' By contrast, Mr Lee's own attempt at self-vindication, 'My Country Versus Me,' is badly written, sanctimonious and dull."""
2,Mixed Results,"The unit works as described, but the picture when using the PC is fuzzy and there is low-level static in the sound. I bought it to hook up an old PS2 to my monitor and that seems to work just fine for that (although that picture may be a bit fuzzy as well, but it's been a while since I've seen PS2 games in action, so it's hard to judge.)Bottom Line:There has to be better VGA box than this."
1,This thing is pure and utter garbage.,"This thing is so bad it should be illegal to sell.I tried playing a PS2 game on my monitor using this and it looked worse then my awful TV by A LOT.It uses a method of conversion called pixel doubling, there are alternatives to VGA conversion like the XVGA2 and while more expensive at least they work as they should."
4,Great soothing music...,This is a great classical guitar album: the performers arranged many of the mainstays of the classical repertoire for the guitar strings in a very pleasant way.
5,Best darn gloves for spear fishing & lobstering,"I bought a pair of these gloves about 10 years ago on my buddy's recommendation. I'm only replacing them now because I lost one. Otherwise, they probably would've lasted another 10 years. Last pair of gloves you'll ever buy (unless of course you lose them, lol)"
5,Great subtle seasonal listening,Excellent selection from various artists. Very soothing and easy to listen to. Well worth the money. Subtle seasonal tunes you might recognize but are freshly delivered.
1,sulca brush,The bristles are very stiff. If you like a softer flexible bristle this is not the sulca brush to buy. In my opinion you should not be using stiff bristles on the gum line.
3,I gave it a four star.,I am very happy with the product. It is slim and I can now clean the inside bottom teeth to remove coffee stain. My dentist is going to be happy with me and I can enjoy my coffee withouout worrying about my next dental cleaning since my dintist scolded me everytime because of my coffee stain.
4,"music, time travel and human indecency","a very entertaining and thoughtfukl treatment of time travel, music and the way that culture views thing over time. the cast includes a plagarist musician, a murderous engineering genius and a very wellknown 19th century composer well worth reading"
3,Experienced Musician Learning Correct Fingerings,"The trombone was my first instrument that I learned in school. I taught myself the recorder and later taught myself the trumpet. I happened upon a used clarinet and decided to learn it. I was able to play it by ear like a recorder, but I didn't know what fingerings go with which notes. That is why I bought the book. In my opinion the book is very good at teaching the basics. A child could not follow it through on their own, but the information is complete. The songs that are included are fun to play and get quite challenging by the end of the book. It is a pretty good beginner book."
3,Remaster is a HUGE Letdown,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great collection of songs! I love them!I owned the vinyl, I bought the Gold cd remaster, too. I think the problem lies with the poorly recorded basic tracks, especially the drums, which are mostly distorted, and lack any dynamic range (cardboard boxes?). Drums, bass, guitars, and synths sound as if they were squeezed onto one track in order to make room for more guitar, synth, voices and string overdubs. I was hoping that Jeff would RESCUE and RESTORE this album, and free up all those elements with a nice stereo mix. Have you heard the restoration on 60's Beatles tracks that make up the remixed/remastered Yellow Submarine? Pet Sounds in Stereo from the original Mono? The awesomely improved sound of Aqualung? Who's Next? My G-G-G-Generation? It HAS been done. The sound is a bit better, but Jeff Lynne, I am disappointed, sir!"
3,Flawed gem,"Buy this one for Nightrider, an irresistibly quirky and intelligent tune which wouldn't be out of place on an early 10 CC album. There are some good tracks on Face the Music but it lacks the overall consistency to make it a classic."
4,My fave college album,"At college I was a DJ in my senior year at the school radio station - for my show my intro was Strange Magic and my exit music was One Summer Dream, both from this album. In my opinion, with this album ELO really started to click, paving the way for their following successes."
5,Another Great From ELO,"I love all of ELO's work, and wonder why they are not in the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. My other favorites including Queen, Pink Floyd, and Led Zeppelin are all there. Something needs to be done about this. Jeff Lynne is a creative genius."
4,It's a winner from start to finish,"While there's only eight songs in the original release format, they are all very good. This is a case where the non-hits are the real gems - Poker rocks, Down Home Town is a funny take on the southern US from a Brit's perspective, and the lush One Summer Dream wraps up the package nicely. I had a chance to see them perform some of this material live in a small theater in Chicago and it was one of the best rock shows I ever saw. They were having a great time performing and it showed. Later I saw them in a large arena during the ""Out of the Blue flying saucer"" tour and it wasn't quite the same at all."
3,evil bong,"This was an alright movie, chong is only in the last 30 minutes of the movie .acting was'nt bad ."
1,"Dude, This Movie Sucks, Bro!!!","This was a very dumb movie about a possessed bong named Eebee. Whenever she is smoked by the stupid pot-heads, they are transported to a world with hot women. That's pretty much all there is! If you have an extremely low IQ from smokin weed all freakin' day, I'm sure you'll love EVIL BONG!!!"
2,More Band then Chong.,"Only thing I thought was cool about this movie was how Band mixed a few of his other horror movie characters in it. I think reviewers are focusing on Chong too much when this isn't really a Chong movie. Chong is on the cover to get some sells. It wasn't like he was in the entire movie. He came in towards the end to put an end to this disaster of a movie. This is a Charles Band movie, and like many of his movies they're only good because they're so bad. - And this comes from a Puppet Master fanatic!"
2,Pot Head Horror,"Full Moon studios number about a group of friends who every time they smoke pot from a bong they pass out and are ""killed"" one by one in a dream sequence. Until at the end someone sets them all free. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Bad shipping experence !!!!,"The first stand was damaged and motor is and was not right.A second stand was sent it to was damaged.A second motor was sent, it doesn't work at all.Amazon told me to deal with the company, they said after a week that they will take care of the problem I am still waiting to see what is going to happen. Your company needs to deal with your shippers, both UPS and FEDEX were used and all of the damage seems to be a shipping issue.I will be very carefull on what I order in the future. I have very little confidence in these shipping companies to deliver anything undamaged.Scott"
1,Not for students taking human anatomy,I am a sophmore in college and bought this product thinking the flash cards would help me in my Intro Human Anatomy/Physiology class. What a disapointment!!!!!!! This product might be good if your going to be a massage therapist. Not for the typical student like me just wanting flash cards to help w/ studies there isn't one single card I found useful. Also it's not ring-bound it just has a single punch hole through them and the language/description used is like masters level overall this product was a huge dissapointment and since you have to open it to see what the product is I can't even return it a huge rip-off!!
3,Not as comfy as they would have you believe,"I love the style, and the padded footbed is nice, but with the heel heighth and thong, this is not a comfortable shoe! While not as uncomfortable as one without padding, the thong still rubs a bit (more so than other pairs I have) and as with all heels, your feet feel it after wearing them for awhile."
5,4Him's Magmum Opus!,"This is more than an album. It is a testament of praise and worship to God & Jesus. These guys sing so well. I have 3 of their works (The Ride, Obvious and Hymns) and this one has the most varied sound. There are many instruments used and the studio artist chosen for this disc are excellent. Their vocal arangements are second to none. All four (Andy, Mark, Marty & Kirk)seem to have sung an equal amount on this disc. Standouts are It Is Well, Oh sacred Head Now wounded, Be Thou My Vision and The Love of God, Great Is Thy Faithfullness. Another plus is this CD has all the lyrics and background information about these Hymns. This album is a must for any Christian music fan. Acually, its a must for any music fan."
4,inspiring,"The old-time hymns are arranged in a creative way that is inspiring and wonderful. They are not dry and dead but, alive!"
5,Fabulous Movie,"This movie is wonderful. I don't know how many love stories could withstand a 20 year coma. I own this on video. I have also seen it many times on Lifetime. I was happy to read the info on the movie which has been corrected for the DVD, On the video's jacket, they have the name of Lizzie's husband wrong (Alex)I am not sure why. Glad to see this was corrected for the DVD."
5,Reba shines like never before,"Overcoming superstardom to become a respected actress apart from the vocal talents that made you a legent may be impossible. For anyone that is, except Reba McEntire. She became Lizzie Brooks to me. Her other movies were nothing like this. I forgot it was her up there and got really involved in the story. It has everything: drama, comedy, family. The supporting cast was very well chosen and a wonderful chemistry was achieved. In fact, I am going to watch it again right now!"
5,This is a knock out movie!!!,"Reba McEntire is a great actor, singer, wife, mother, and friend. She not only deserves full credit for this movie, but she deserves all the attention and drama this movie has. Tim Matheson is wonderful in here to, you can actually feel all their emotion and heartbreak that they share. The CBS showing of the movie was excellent to. Reba is phenominal. We love you Reba!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,McEntire Cannot Act!!,Let's make this short and sweet. Miss McEntire cannot act her way out of a paper bag. What could have been a good movie is marred by her performance. The story lacks credibility and is not helped by her amateurish emoting.
5,IT WAS JUST WOUNDERFULL,"Reba has established her self as a good actress.In this movie she shows that agen.Reba is a vary good singer and in her songs she is able to make you cry,laugh,sing,and go throught all diffront kind or mentions.And now she has learn the art of makeing you fell that way when she acts.So from where I stand I will just say way to go Reba you have done it agen."
5,BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!!!,"I just got done watching this movie, and I have to say that it's one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I was skeptical at first, but by the end of the movie, I was thrilled my family rented it. The plot was fantastic, and the love story between Alex and Lizzie was magical. It was bittersweet and utterly romantic. This movie is timelessly brilliant!!"
5,Reba does it again,"I don't know how she does it. Reba makes you feel like you are in the movie. I saw it when it was on CBS and I loved it. On ever break I would call my friend and we would talk about what just happened. I was smart enough to tape it when it on CBS, but I would love to have another copy so I can lend it to people."
5,Excellent movie,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Reba did a wonderful job portraying the woman in the movie. I recommend it to anyone that wants to see a good movie. I can't wait till the price goes down and I will definitely get a copy.
5,"Movie was excellent, would recommend to anyone, and have",Reba did an excellent job in this movie. I'm not a Reba fan and would recommend this movie in a minute (and have).
5,Forever Love,"well,i love this movie because it has reba in it and i LOVE her.This movie is sad but very romantic.I really like this movie because,i dont know ,i cant excpress it .(:"
5,The Bad Boys At Their Best,"While Classics Live II and A Little South of Sanity may be cleaner recordings, this album gives you the ultimate song selection. Nowehere else on a legal album will you be able to hear live versions of ""Chip Away at The Stone"" and ""S.O.S(Too Bad)."" This is the band playing live during their 70s peak. Raw family fun for all to enjoy."
4,Better than Classics Live....,"I think this album is great, better than ""Classics live!"", but in my opinion ""A little south of sanity"" is the best live album of Aerosmith with all the respect to the other fans."
5,Warts and All!,"The inclusion of Mother Popcorn from the bootleg 1973 at Pall's Mall in Boston is worth the price of admission. Tight, Funky, Greasy, Raunchy, Raw, Rock & Roll.I like this live album because it shows the band as it was, warts and all."
5,Great,"This CD has the best versions of ""Back In The Saddle"" and ""Walk This Way"". I have the original LP and even that sounds great."
2,Bad in the saddle,"Like Aerosmith? Me too. Like Aerosmith early days? Me too. But this album is not for me. Poor cover versions of James Brown and The Beatles, awful ""Back in the saddle"", terrible ""Train kept on rolling"" and sick ""Sick as a dog"" made me sick of it. Easier to mention the good titles: ""Lord of things"" is made here much better than in ""Get your wings""; ""Walk this way"" is also good and ""Dream on"" is great. Nothing more to write about, besides the bad sound recording. Poor album of a good band."
4,Competent Live Album,"By the time this 1978 live album was recorded, Aerosmith were already falling into a steep decline, and the album plays testament to that. Several times on the album the band sounds completely fried, and Steven Tyler messes up the lyrics quite regularly. The band sounds out of rythem sometimes, and ""Back in the Saddle"" sounds REALLY off (although the heavy bass sound of the studio version is quite difficult to duplicate live).That said, this is stil pretty good. The band on the whole perform decent renditions of all the Aerosmith classics, as well as a few rarities. The set list is pretty solid, with no huge holes in the canon of Aerosmith classics (though ""Train Kept a Rollin"" is sadly abbreviated).Overall, this is a solid purchase for a fan of '70s Aerosmith. While it may not be great by any stretch of the imagination, it is competent enough."
1,More Like Dead Bootleg,"Go back, go back, the other folks are being sentimental or loyal. From an Aero-fan from way back when, I can tell you that this album, which sounded like it was recorded in a shoe box, is awful. It's worth it for a few things that may strike your taste, e.g. a recording of ""Mother Popcorn"" in which the band is outshined by the guest saxophonist, a raw energetic studio run through of ""Come Together"", a nice performance of ""Chip Away At the Stone"". Otherwise, buyer beware, the boys were chemically imbalanced and it shows."
2,One-season timer,"I purchased three of these timers in 2008. They were easy to program and worked well during the first season in my drip system. In the second season they started failing one by one and are now useless. The problem is incomplete opening. I've taken them apart and cleaned them, but it doesn't help. The tech I spoke to at the company was friendly and said that they would replace all of the timers."
1,Dribbles,"Used in a drip-watering application, the valve opening is evidently too small to permit enough flow to sustain the 15-psi minimum required for the drippers"
1,terrible,"I bought two of these, hooked it up and left last summer. When I got home three months later, my plants were dead and my trees were dying. Apparently, I didn't tighten the hose up to the device well and water leaked inside the battery case and killed it. That was the one in the shade. The one out in the sun melted in our 120 degree desert heat. Funny, these timers are for watering outside and they didn't hold up to the elements of water and sun."
2,Exceeded Expectations,"Works well and is easy to program. But it is VERY EXPENSIVE when compared to similar timers--which I didn't do until after purchase.Addendum: Bought several of these. One inexplicably quit working after being stored for the winter. I used it just ONE season. Reading the other reviews, it appears product failure is quite common. I retract my recommendation of 5 stars."
2,Waste of my money,I am going to Botswana in a few months and heard the Kalahari is the best place in the world to see stars. I was hoping on learning someone about what stars I would be seeing with this book but that isn't what the book is about at all. It's about different astrological labs and old astronomers from the nation of South Africa. I don't find it to be interesting at all but maybe you will. And I was so excited when it was delievered!
3,Lots of options,It's nice to have a variety of choices when designing a project. This book has great diagrams and directions and a good variety of types of stitches to choose from.
4,A Great Story!,"This is the second book in Donna Kauffman's ""Delgado's Dirty Dozen"" series and a great romantic suspense read.This story revolves around John McShane a rugged operative for a government agency called The Dirty Dozen. He flies to the Caribbean on a rescue mission in answer to Cali Ellis's plea for help. Still deeply troubled by the way he handled Cali after her husband Nathan's (John's partner and best friend) death, ten years ago, he knew this had to be serious in order for her to seek him out. John and Cali work together to uncover the truth behind her husband's death. Their lives are in danger and this draws them closer together.Cali is a strong female character and John is a wonderful alpha male. It is also interesting to read about the other characters that are part of The Dirty Dozen.This novel is full of suspense, romance and passion and I look forward to reading the next book in this series."
5,it took me weeks to find my replacement thank you so much. i was lost without my purple stapler,"Thank you for the prompt shipment, exactly what i wanted. I am truly a happier person now that my replacement is here. Thank you"
5,Cool stapler,I had one of these before and it dropped and broke so I had to get another one! This will staple multiple pages (not too thick) without any problems and is a really nice looking stapler. I would recommend this.
5,The most beautiful soundtrack especially the shower scene score,"This is my all time favorite soundtack & i have quite a few... I ordered the CD special when i was 17 in 1997 and i'm still listening to it even put it on my iphone to listen to when i'm bored i'm at work. Katie Irving, Amy Irving's sister, who sings two tracks on there is absolutely beautiful. Even the scores where scary stuff is happening is enjoyalble. Everything about this soundtrack is great."
1,Steel Blues? I know why!,The only reason this blues recording is named Steel Blues is because it sounds as if it was mixed and remastered in a large steel drum! What a wonderful mix of artists in such a horrible and VERY bad recording. Do Not waste your money on this. I am tossing my copy in the trash.
1,Sins of Omission,Skelton has left the skeletons buried deep inside Cosima's closet.Once again we have less than full disclosure in the quest for the Great Wagnerian Myth.A comparison of sources reveals that the reason for the breech with Richter was due to his marriage to a Jewess. [This omitted in the abridgement].One of the more fascinating aspects of the Cosima Wagner diaries are many of the dreams that she records Richard passed on to her.The not-so-tidy subject of self-flaggelation with candles is tidily omitted in Skelton.Caveat Emptor.
3,These are NOT Quadra-Cut bits,"A Freud Quadra-Cut bit has four cutters, Amazon is shipping older models that have only two cutters.A Freud representative told me that Amazon bought a lot of old two cutter inventory and that is what they are shipping.I received two of these before I gave up and ordered it elsewhere."
1,SHEARING,GEORGE SHEARING IS USUALLY TERRIFIC; ESPECIALLY THE LATIN ALBUMS.THIS MUST BE THE WORST ALBUM HE RECORDED. DO NOT BUY IT!
5,Great Book!,"This is a wonderful history of Sarah Schenirer, her students, and their vision of providing formal education to Jewish girls. A must read for anyone interested in women in Judaism."
5,Makes great dipping oil for home baked bread!,"I really don't know how this spice is used traditionally, but a friend of mine introduced me to Zahtar. I mix this spice with cold pressed olive oil and a bit of salt to make a dipping oil for my home baked bread, and it's awesome! This was priced really good compared to ethnic food stores, and the amount lasts me for couple months."
3,Just Meh...,"The Za'atar I used at Le Cordon Bleu (made fresh) and prepackaged one used at the restos I have worked at are far better than this one. It's dried thyme, white sesame seeds, and sumac. As an addition to home cooking, say a roasted (brined before hand) chicken breast, I guess it works fine. But the flavor is almost stale and somewhat boring. Other items from Zamouri (Chermoula, Ras El Hanout, etc) were more flavorful, although nothing can beat making these spice mixes fresh."
3,Spice,"Nice quality, not particularily inspriring. Packed well, came quickly, would do business with this company again. Looks just like picture advertised."
2,Dried up,I recieved this item today and the gel mask is dried up. The other items in the set are fine. Gel mask is useless now.
5,SIMPLY TERRIFIC!,"My original copy of this album was a cassette, which I managed to wear out. This remains one of my favorite CDs and I am the proud owner of over 700 CDs! I have purchased all of Ms. Olivor's CDs but Stay the Night is definitely the best! Every song is great! Her voice is spectacular--I could listen for hours! It would be wonderful to hear more from Jane Olivor!"
4,I remember Jane,"In the late 70's my then girlfriend and now wife of 30 years, discovered Jane Olivor and her romantic songs. When recently listening to Linda Eder a new young talent bursting to stardom, we thought of how Linda Eder is a refreshing blend of Carol King, Jane Olivor and Streisand. Check our Linda Eder if you're a Jane fan or check out this album if you like Linda Eder.Great music either way"
1,More like a reader's peril,"If you're collecting the Shatner/Trek series, skip this one. There are a few glimpses into the early days of Kirk on theoriginal Enterprise and you can see--barely--the command crew starting to form but, other than that, zilch. It reads as if it has been padded or stretched. On a scale of 1 to 5 with ""Ashes of Eden"" being a 5, this is barely a 1. Get over the Kirk/Picard forced friendship. This is where I stop on the collection, put it like that."
3,Woop! Forget Something?,"This novel is average at best. The ending of the main story is interesting, but the secondary ""flashback"" story is simply dropped. It is odd when you read something for a couple of hundred pages and then it just disappears. Very strange...like something is missing. I can't say much more without needlessly giving away too much information.The character of Picard is treated poorly. He comes off as a somewhat scared, play by the rules flunky to Kirk's ""damn the torpedo"" persona. Both characters are represented poorly. This continues the later Shatner novel characterizations which is unfortunate since the first novels were so good.On the positive, the main story is vaguely interesting if you are willing to put up with yet another ""murder mystery"" Trek novel.In the end, the novel was an ok read but nothing to right a review about...oh wait, too late."
2,Swing and a Miss,"Well another step up to bat and another miss. From reading Shatners books I see an author or authors trying to do too much and cover too much in one book. Give it a rest and just tell a good story.I was sad when they killed off Kirk in the movie, but maybe Shatner should just leave him buried till he can write a good story."
1,Sick Of Shatner & Kirk.....,"Having been a Star Trek fan/reader since the beginning, I've finally had enough of Kirk (and Shatner's writing thereof). It's been a long time since I read an original Trek story I liked, and Shatner's writing is lacking the warmth and depth of character that I used to enjoy in Trek novels.I know that all the Trek TV series are on-going stories of the characters but why do so many of these novels have to be series (trilogies, etc.)? Other than just for pulling in more money. I've wasted plenty of time (and book money) on 1st volumes....It's time to move on.... Where have all the stand-alone science fiction novels gone?"
3,Not Bad But Not Great,"The setting of this most recent Shatner Trek novel is on Bajor. Picard and Kirk are orbital skydiving and just recreating while on shore leave when they discover a possible murder and some sort of conspiracy. I have vague memories of the details since it took me about 3 months to get through this, having to give it back to the library and such. It starts off pretty well with the Cardassion battle but then as the book progresses it goes down hill. It seemed that Shatner delved a little to much into the conversations and chattering between Kirk and Picard instead of focusing on interesting and engaging plot and storylines. Still, it was ok, I guess. Shatner is supposedly making this into a trilogy. If that's the case, I hope it improves with books 2 and 3."
2,Don't Bother,"With the latest 'Shatnerverse' novel it might be time to consider putting William Shatner's Kirk novels out to pasture. This is the first title in a planned trilogy but it not only fails to hold the readers interest, it's down right ludicrous in many ways.Set on Bajor after the Dominion War where Kirk and Picard are taking a joint vacation planning to explore an archeology site they find themselves caught up in a web of deception that has escalated to murder. Through flashbacks Kirk remembers a missionearly in his career as captain of the Enterprise. The flashbacks are meant to set up the subsequent books but long before the end of this novel I found myself losing interest in the long-winded narrative.If you're a die-hard fan and will read this title anyway, wait for the paperback. This book is not worth wasting your money on."
3,"Good concept, bad execution","If you've got access to the 2nd edition of Talislanta, this book adds a lot in the realms of Magic and provides a few interesting plot hooks and story lines. But the book is little more than a rehashing of a favorite game with a few illogical rule changes and a couple of new sketches."
2,Shock of Tha Hour sounds more like a demo,"I believe Seventh Vision deserves recognition for their effort at making a blistering rapcore album. After all, with so many bands producing music like this, it is hard to produce a powerhouse album. For the listener who has not experienced any rapcore before, this is a nice, raw album to start out with. My taste is more for a polished product though. And this is not a polished product. If you want a Christian rapcore album that rivals the hodgepodge of secular rapcore out there then I would suggest P.O.D.'s The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. I exchanged shock of tha hour for that and am a happy listener. I'm sure Seventh Vision will mature as they release more albums and in the future I look forward to giving a better review and hearing a better album."
3,computer cd review,"Im sure the product was a good one, but i will never get to know. The cd required a 64 bit compiter capability and mine only had 32 bit. Oh well."
3,Not compatible with Vista,"Have tried just about everything to get this to work, but cannot get it to work on a Microsoft Vista software. So beware! Seller was prompt and no problems there, just an older version is required to work this. :o("
5,"Haier 15"" LCD TV",I bought this tv for my bedroom. The TV sits about 3' away from me so it is a nice size. The tv handles the digital cable input quite well. Though the tv is HDTV ready I don't have HDTV service. The picture is great and sound is pretty good. The wide screen aspect ratio is great for watching DVDs. DVDs look fantastic as the tv can handle the higher resolution (you need to use an S-Video cable). I bought this on sale for right around $135 delivered so it was quite a bargain. I highly recommend the tv.
5,"Yo, this is like my Great Grandparents music, but it's jiggy","I'm jiggy with' dis. It all cool baby. Perry Como is so out, he's in. I especially like the novelty songs, he badder than Snoop Dog. Even if you think ya Grampa's music sucks, this music is cool, maybe Gramps had good taste in music afterall, yo yo it all cool babydoll... Dis' music rocks, it da bomb, it's phat, it's da sh*t!!!"
4,Best Of Perry Como,"Again I enjoyed this CD's as it had a number of Perry Como's hits from the 1950's, such as Catch A Falling Star, Round and Round?, etc. He was a popular singer who had his own TV Show for years."
3,A decent introduction that skims the 150+ hit singles Perry placed on the charts,"It's a nice introduction and a convenient package. As one other reviewer said, effectively, this set is another update/reissue of COMO'S GOLDEN RECORDS, which dates on Lp from 1958+, and at the price point a principal reason I purchased it--it's a convenient player on the speakers (when I don't want to pull an Lp). Sound quality is decent, mostly mono tracks, as they should be.I give the set three stars due to the schizophrenic inclusion of the final two early '70s hits from late in Como's career that stand out in some stylistic contrast to the 1945-57 playlist from his peak popularity. It's akin to having, say, an Elvis hits comp that would have 20 (round number) 1950s' rock 'n' roll tracks and then closing the set on a couple hits from the '70s.Convenient, nice price."
4,Four Recently bought CD's.,"All four of the CD's were bought as gifts for someone else, and mailed to her some 500 miles away. She loves them for the most part, particularly the Perry Como one. She doesn't know the songs to the Josh Groban one but likes it anyway. She loves the Anne Murrey one, and is still making up her mind about the Sarah Brightman CD."
4,The Very Best of Perry Como,"This is much better and has more recent recordings than the set of 3 cd's titled ""till the end of time"" by IMC Music, year 2000."
4,Still Mr. Casual...,"This cd is worthwhile because Perry Como still represents some of the finest, coolist vocalizing to be found anywhere.Today's singers could learn a lot from this gentleman of song. For me, his singing of ""Impossible"" is worth the price ofthe product. The only thing that prevents me from giving this a fifth star is that it also includes a couple of nonsensical""cute"" songs that also marked the 50s and 60s. Perry is the greatest."
3,Remaster vs Original CD,"I've just bought four remastered ELOs, and already compared two of them, new Out Of The Blue was clearly worst in every aspect. This edition is almost identical to the original CD EXCEPT that it is COMPRESSED!!! WHY? Digital era made almost all producers wanting to sound louder, rock mixing doesn't have a standard loudness as movies. So each decade albums are more and more compressed and less and less musical. As an example, ending of first song (King...) has some pizzicato at peaking at -15db, new version is at -10db (5db louder), so dynamic range has been lost. All pianissimos are loud. Musicality has been lost because of this, I'm afraid all new remaster editions has been heavily compressed.Original CDs editions have a very good sound quality, I would stick to those versions unless you want bonus tracks.I give 2.5 stars, 4 because of the music and 1 for poor mastering."
5,Three's the charm.,"I assume you already know what's on this recording or you wouldn't be here, right? Don't you probably have a thirty-year-or-so old vinyl copy of this that you haven't listened to for years because it's dusty and has scratches and pops and who listens to that stuff anymore anyway?Well, I won't review the music here because others have done better than I would, but I will say that listening to this remaster through a high quality set of headphones (Sennheiser) has enabled me to hear this as if it were the first time. It's totally worth the money to get this new version, and the bonus tracks just make it even more fun."
4,Third Time's A Charm For ELO,"With their third album, 1973's ""On The Third Day,"" the Electric Light Orchestra continued to evolve into a terrific symphonic rock group. Although their first two albums certainly have their share of gems, ""On The Third Day"" is, in my opinion, the band's first truly good album, with Jeff Lynne & company finally hitting their stride. Wonderful ELO tunes on this one: the classic hits ""Showdown"" and ""Ma Ma Ma Belle,"" as well as other fine prog-poppers like ""Ocean Breakup/King Of The Universe,"" the instrumental ""Daybreaker,"" the excellent ""Dreaming Of 4000,"" and an awesome re-working of the classical favorite, ""The Hall Of The Mountain King."" Great melodies, production, performances, and strong lead vocals by Lynne combine into a masterful ELO disc. With ""On The Third Day,"" the Electric Light Orchestra were finally on their way, and their music would only get better. A highly-recommended ELO album."
3,"I hate to drag down the average customer review, but....","Let's face it, this is a nice little transitional record for ELO. It obviously has some high points. For instance, ""Showdown"" is the first really good ELO single, and ""Dreaming of 4000"" is just great. Also, ""Ma-Ma-Ma Belle"" rocks and it is certainly a good song, even if it is somewhat derivative (of a Mott the Hoople song, I can't remember the name of it, though).The first side suite is solid, but it pales when compared to what Lynne would accomplish on ELDORADO or even on the ""Concerto for a Rainy Day"" from OUT OF THE BLUE. ""Bluebird is Dead"" probably the best song from the suite.So, over-all, this is a good, but not great record. But, hey, it was released only about 10 months after ELO II. Jeff and the boys would really hit their stride on the next album."
2,WORTH A LISTEN,"I say worth a listen if you are a hardcore, buy everything ELO fan, but for beginners who are just starting to listen to ELO, this is an easy pass. Granted the re-mastering sound is great and there are parts of this album I do kind of enjoy, but I find most of it hard to ingest. I can't really seem to want to listen to the album as a whole, just parts of it. Giving it 2 stars may be a little harsh. It's not a bad album or horrible by any means. But it's just about average at best for me. I guess I just prefer that soon to come ELO sound after this. But it is worth a listen. Maybe give it try, you may like it better than I did."
5,wild orchestra and rock mix.,"This isn't my favorite elo cd but it's a great one. I must admit that I like side two or the last tracks better than the rock opera on the first side. That being said you know that elo is a prog rock band and you expect things like that from that type of band. Elo makes music that should last far into the future because it's just great. You get two 'hits' here the top forty 'showdown' a real classic radio track and 'ma ma belle' which also was a hit. that's very good for any cd however unlike most cd's this one isn't a collection of songs only, the first group of songs are interconnected and run on a theme. This band could always pull off grand ambitions and that just makes ELo all the more remarkable. I like the remasters on all these elo releases and I would say those who harping on sound issues aren't listening to the same recording I heard. At least in their own heads."
1,Incredibly repetitive,"I hate this type of music more than anything, let that be known first. My friend enjoys this horrible band however, and after listening to them i wish i was deaf. Every song sounds the same, the lyrics are from a 12 year olds journal. Terrible."
2,If Only You Were Lonely,"Hawthorne Heights is just a horrible and desperateattempt in trying to fit in with the whole emo trend.The lyrics are WAY to simple and pointless.This CD isn't completely horrible, but I would stillreccommend that you buy another CD such as:*Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge - My Chemical Romance*Define The Great Line - Underoath*Liberation Transmission - Lostprophets*Hours - Funeral For A Friend"
4,First!!,"3.75/5Ive always hated this band and thier last album, but this is much better. Much better than I thought it would be, but still not great. Catchy stuff."
1,this is as punk rock as a little pink dress. stay away at all costs!,"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
4,Do they write their own music?,"I enjoy music written and performed by the artist who saw their baby through from its conception. anymore I get the feeling that music is too watered down, ""mainstreamed"" or corporate-ized to the extent that it is no longer ""music"" but more closely related to a commercial for distraught youth; playing on emotions and fads written by a ""think tank"" for the ""label"". I feel that for a band to be a genuine band they had to have known each other outside of their ""professional"" relationship to create CDs. I say *forget* all that other stuff and stick to the creator/composer who has had a garage band and the hunger to attain a record deal through their quality music. I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket but I can sing any of Ashlee Simpson's songs as well as she can... could I get a $5 million record deal with royalties and be on MTV for a week so when its ""reveiled"" i cant sing ill be a celeberty anyway? Rock on Cobain."
2,Just so so,"I love Hawthorne Heights, there licks and everything are sometimes catchy, sometimes not. If only you were lonely is something that you really cant appreciate as much as you would like to. Saying sorry just blows every song on the album away. I dont know about you, but I personally cannot stand when bands start a song the same way as another song, let alone with the same note? Come on, you couldnt of been more creative? That sadly happens on this album. HH I'll give you more credit when the songs start sounding like you wanted to write every song as if it were your last. Either way they keep rockin.. Rock on!"
1,Hmmmmm.....,"You know.... I just got to say that this band sucked then and they suck even more now.... With the same, lame, boring vocals with no emotion at all... Some turd in the background screaming like he's got a cob shoved in you know where... And all the songs sound the same.. Same notes, same lyrical concept.... It's like you've taken a big steaming pile of poop and blended it with some cottage cheese... It's bands like this and Silverstein and anything Victory Records puts out that make us actual music lovers want to puke.... They say pop music is dead.. No it's not.... It just sounds even suckier than before.. And this is it.. The ""new"" pop music..... How's that Steven....???? You suck as a VJ.... Where's Metal Asylum???"
2,ughhh...what is this?,"geez,im listening to this on itunes,and thinking about how much better other bands are then them.im completely against flooding with 'This band sucks!!!' no,i own this Cd and i listen to it...and the songs sound the same!!!i listen for the guitars and music,and the songs vocals and riffs sound like the same old ideas being repeated...seriously,like 'pens and needles' and 'this is who we are' begginings sound like they just took a guitar or two out.Listening to this,i just keep thinking 'havent i heard this song before!?' i havent heard their entire other album,but the tracks i heard were way better than half the repeats on this album!!!if your looking for a good CD,i would not reccomend wasting your hard earned cash on this album.Just buy one of their songs and play it over and over,and you will have this album!!!"
2,Would be better if you could tell the difference between the tracks,"Almost all the songs sound the same, I see why you can listen to the whole CD from start to finish, it's like one big song.Can anyone tell me why there is a version A and version B when it looks to like the only that's different is the album art. What kind of marketing ploy is that??"
2,Not as bad as a lot of the reviewers rate it,"The musicianship is so-so. A lot of the songs and the material sound the same. Quite a few of the songs get annoying after hearing them multiple times.I pretty much got sick of listening to every song on this cd except for ""Dead in the Water"" this afternoon. The drug addiction undertones, aside, I think it's performed reasonably well, it paints a picture, and it's catchy.As an afterthought, I think the screaming is overdone and a lot of it can be taken out. In places, I think it's used well as emphasis of lyrics but only when it's done over the regular lead singer."
5,Great CD,If you don't like Hawthorne Heights or their genre clearly you will not like the CD. SO DON'T BUY IT AND LATER COMPLAIN ABOUT IT!!!! I really love this CD. I liked their old one also. Every song on this CD makes you want to jump around and rock out. Definately something I listen to a lot. If you are a pop punk and Hawthorne Heights fan buy this!
1,disgrace to rock music,"i can't stand the single ""saying sorry."" the commercial is on every 3 seconds and the fact that the song is so bad completely turns me away from even touching the album. god-awful."
4,yep...,"Honestly, I thought their first album was poorly produced,and kinda boring. My band, Better Known Enemy...(www.myspace.com/betterknownenemy) opened for them soon after they were signed to Victory and I was blown away by their live sound, but the cd was unsatisfying. The new album, however, is much happier...less monotony, and it keeps my attention. The lyrics could be better, but hey....this isn't Thursday."
1,If Only You Were Lonely...This CD is just [...],"When I first bought Hawthorne Heights 'If Only You Were Lonely' I had alot of anticipation for it but after listening to it I was just completley disappointed. There is only about 1 maybe 2 decent songs on the entire album. Each song, I think, is poorly written, JD the lead singer sounds and sings horendous, and overall it is just a bad album. I wouldn't recommend 'If Only You Were Lonely' to anybody."
2,If Only You Were A (fill in the blank),"Over all, not a terrible CD, if you can get past the screams. (Not good enough to release two versions of the same CD, however, even if it did have different artwork and DVDs inside.) Personally, the screaming ""thing"" doesn't add to the songs because it's such an OVERUSED device in several types of music nowadays, so it makes me want to skip ahead and see what's next rather than listen to the song finish. Guys in H.H., if you ever read any of these reviews, look for a different gimmick than ""Emo-Screamo"". If you want to wear your hearts on your sleeves, that's fine, but when you blend in with everyone else, your music will get lost in the shuffle. That's not a good thing, right?As far as the screaming ""thing"" goes, a guy sounding like his [...] are being squeezed in a bench vise WHILE an unlubricated watermelon is being slowly inserted in his [...] is NOT singing, I don't care who is doing it..."
1,"I have to agree with everyone, it is a bad album","I do not like to diss or put down bands, because I myself am a musician. But I also hate to get rip my money off, by bad material. I imagine if I hate that, you would too!I bought this album, because some people told me that this band was a good emo or some type of progressive rock band, but it was a DECEPTION. There is not one song I can say I liked from this album. Good thing i bought this cd for $9.00 at BEST BUY, but it is not worth that money. I just have the CD lying somewhere, probably lost already. I do not recomend this Album. If you feel like wasting your money on this band, waste it on their first CD, ""The Silence of Black and White,"" it is better than this CD, but you better keep in mind that it will not be the greatest CD you will ever hear.My Point is dont buy this CD!"
4,people..,"Look everyone, we all have different views of this band obveously. That doesn't mean you should be saying the band sucks or that they don't have enough life experience. There more successfull then alot of other bands out there. I saw them in concert and they were awesume. I have to admit that they aren't the best band of all time, but they do not suck. This CD was really good. Better than their last one. For people who are saying they have no talent at all, obveously they do if their selling their CD's and have sold out concerts. Just because you don't like them doesnt mean that they're neccessarally crap. I see that some people may dislike them, but this band is screamo/emo and if you don't like them don't listen to them. Personally i dislike rap music, but that doesn't mean i think it's crap. I like music with words that mean something. This music says alot of things. I appriciate that in a song. So i guess my point is, please don't say a band sucks if you don't really know them.-Jenna"
1,Sissy music for sissy kids,"I can't even think of anything really nasty and vile to say about this. It pretty much speaks for itself. Talentless, over hyped, over popular, homoerotic bullsh*t.Remember kids fads don't last so don't buy in. Laugh at the one's who do buy stuff like this. Show them it's not alright to be a media drone. As for this particular waste of circular plastic disc, I had the misfortune to experience a few tracks from it. I never want to experience that ever again.This cd gets a 0 for offering nothing worth hearing.This band gets a pink fluffy sweater for their homoerotic tendencies."
2,If Only You Would Grow Up,"I know it never turns out well to give a negative review to a band like this, but this band is helping perpetuate what should be a dying genre. These guys are to screamo what Toby Keith is to country, namely an artist who has the public eye but sadly misrepresents the other lesser known but better acts. Their lyrics are too cliched and the music lacks creativity. Sure, they can be catchy here and there, but as a whole they just sound too much like a band that came along after the scene got stale. Meanwhile, a band like Thrice makes an effort to evolve, and they are met with mostly jeers. I mean at least Thrice is trying. Before you buy this, I'd recommend checking out the Blood Brothers, Neon Blonde, Further Seems Forever (especially How To Start a Fire), Gatsby's American Dream, and maybe even Test Icicles. Then, if you find you still crave mediocrity and sameness, you'll know Hawthorne Heights is for you."
2,Best is yet to come,"If HAWTHORNE HEIGHTS is taking over the world, then it's the end of life as we know it! I mean this band loses so much of it's great promise by being a group of teenagers gripping & moaning over rock music that life isn't fair or someone hasn't done them right. They could be so much more then they are with A LITTLE MORE LIFE EXPERIENCE behind them. However to whom much is given much is expected. This will be a band to reckon with in about 5-6 years if they can stay fresh and not drop out of sight.With bands like Fall Out Boy that might be hard to do."
1,"mmmm, not so good","it has a sizing problem, my mom and I measured my hands and it said size M, but it is too big and when I swim with that it did not work well.I have to organized all time and I can not swim goodI am so sad, because it was so expensive and I can not use it :("
4,I feel so speedy!,"I use these for surfing. They are comfortable and do what they are supposed to do, i.e., give you a bit more zip in your paddle. They also have the added benefit of keeping your hands a little warmer and even more notably, helping keep your hands from getting scratchs, pinched or otherwise injured from the board or leash. It does take a bit of getting used to, because you have to train your body to do the opposite of what it was trained to do before (keeping your fingers spread, as opposed to cupping tightly without gloves). Also, I experienced a bit more arm and shoulder muscle fatigue, because I'm moving your water and pulling harder, but that only lasted a few outings.Since I got them, I have not surfed without them."
2,Glove serves purpose,"Gloves serve purpose. I use them surfing (occasionally) & you do notice much more power in each stroke. They do fill with water which makes the a little cumbersome & heavy increasing fatigue.I wouldn't recommend these for swimming training (pool), I've used plastic hand paddles & they work far better, but, as said these provide grip when out on the surf board & keep you hands slightly warmer."
2,"Not a guide, per se","This book is not a practical guide to getting a job or succeeding in academia, but rather the perspective of an emeritus professor looking back on her career. It's well-written and inspiring, but tends to veer dangerously close to trite and sentimental."
4,Swinging Hard,"A superb session, with the leader in top form and Kenny Garrett taking it to the peak.One star deducted for Tain's (dismal) vocals on the last track -- someone *should* have stepped in and persuaded him to stick to the drums.An important correction. In most on-line sources, the guitar player is listed as David (or Dave) Gilmour, and assumed to be the British guitarist (born 1946, Cambridge, England) of Pink Floyd fame. That is a mistake. The guitarist is, in fact, the American David Gilmore (born 1964, Cambridge, MA), who can be heard as leader onRitualism(Orchard, 2001) andUnified Presence(RKM, 2006)."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this thinking it was the women from the PBS special. It isn't. Don't be fooled! This isn't nearly the calibre of Celtic Woman with Chloe, Meav, and Lisa."
5,termendous,Celtic WomanI saw for the 1st time on a TV specialNEVER HEAR ABOUT THEM...I loved ..So surfin on internet for others ..HUM..I found the CDUAU..!!!I got it ..instantly.now the girls are on my CD_ChangerGo..buy it ..it's wonderfull...after a dinner.....smoking a cigar..a class of Gran_Manier..Do it ..it's lovely-----Silvio --Orlando/FL---56 yo.
3,new celtic woman cd,"I was disappointed with this cd only because I had thought the music would be in a more traditional celtic style. Although the musical and recording quality is quite fine, most of these sections are in a pop/rock or folk sound. The selections that are more traditional celtic sound include only those by McKennitt and Ni Dhomhnaill. If you're looking for a contemporary vocal female sound in general, you will probably like this recording but the composers could be from a number of Western countries besides those of Celtic origin."
5,An Awesome Combination of Celtic & Folk Music,"I received this CD for Christmas this year, and I love it!At first I had expected it to be much like my other ""Celtic Woman"" CD (the one with the blue cover and the picture of the red-haired woman) - which I also love. However, this one is different... While listening I was trying to figure out what was so different between the two, as the songs on both tell a story, and you can definitely hear the celtic-type voices - what I realized was that many of the songs on this CD could be categorized as ""folk"" music, whereas on the other CD, it was clearly celtic... I hope that makes sense (smile)...So, if you love ""folk"" & ""celtic"" type music, you can't go wrong with this CD. I know I'll be listening to it for many years to come!"
2,"Celtic Woman, Vol. 1",Nothing of what I believed it to be. Do not recommend if you are looking for music similar to the Celtic Woman Video.
5,Celtic Woman Vol. 1,Fabulous traditional Irish songs by young women who have the voices of angels and the instrumental talents which make this a treasure.My girlfriend and I love the Celtic Woman CD!
5,Snug and tight; good and right!,"Fits well for my 13.5 laptop. Small and compact with places for my chord and assorted ""stuff."" Glad I bought it."
3,nice bag - quality not so great,"Bought the bag - like the size and style. However, stitching on the shoulder strap unraveled in the first week - no question its a manufacturing defect. The warranty is a ""you pay to ship our defect back to us"" warranty. Meaning its pretty much useless - they take no accountability for their mistakes. My wife will fix the strap and we will chalk this one up to experience. So purchase if you like the style and be ready to fix the defects yourself - their quality control does not appear to be that good."
3,too few distinctions,"Like another reader, I found the lack of distinction between mentally ill and simply ""obnoxious"" siblings too reductive. Those of us with mentally ill sibs have a whole other set of problems to deal with -- including our fears for our own sanity and for our children. More specific books, such as ""Mad House: Growing Up in the Shadow of Mentally Ill Siblings,"" address these family issues in much greater detail"
3,"Could have done without the tempest, but good anyway","I found this book painfully true. I like how the author is not afraid to tell it like it actually is in the family when one is mentally ill. I admire how she can take all the emotion out of herself and write the facts of the situation about her life, it shows a strong spirit. Many of the stories and theories did not apply completely to me but a few were dead on. For a person who rarely cries and cried during reading a book, it says something right? The "" Normal One"" says much of what so many people are afraid to think and say aloud. I am 16 now and I'm sure this book will be one I read many more times in the future. I recommend this book to everyone, especially people who know a family such as this. It opens a window to the outside world that cannot fully comprehend the turmoil. And of course to the ones that suffer each day from a sibling being completely mad and driving us all up the wall at one time or another."
3,Its okay.,I was not expecting to read mainly about mental illness as the book indicates.So it was not the best read.
2,bibliotherapy for the author,"I found this book infuriating. The entire first chapter is basically the author feeding the reader a predigested, much too reductive analysis of her family background. She seems overly invested in her status and her perception of herself as a ""sensitive"" person. This permeates the entire book; it's self-referential in the extreme and seems to have been written as bibliotherapy for the author in order to make herself feel better.She also lumps together the disabled, mentally ill, and simply ""obnoxious"" (!!) siblings as if there is no difference in who they are and how they have an impact on their families.I do think that this is an important subject, and has needed to be addressed in nonfiction for quite some time. (Authors of fiction have gotten there first; for example, Cathi Hanauer's MY SISTER'S BONES.)Finally, and, most important: what exactly IS ""normal""? Who defines it? And why is it so important to be ""normal,"" anyway?"
2,The history of Kwanza was good; the storyline BAD!,OK! Let's sum this book up. Happily married couple. Husband abandons family. Husband returns two years later with stories of espionage and secret undercover government conspiracies. Wife shoots husband. Family forgives husband. Town rallies around husband to prevent the bad guys from getting him. Husband & wife go on the run to clear name. Wife saves husband. Family lives happily ever after.Give me a break! This book was really fictitious. I could not beleive half of the things the characters were saying or their actions. I appreciate the lessons of Kwanza and giving me an understanding of how to incorporate this holiday into my own family but I think more time should have been put in character development than the push to get us all to celebrate Kwanza.
4,A very complete love story with intrigue and resolution,"In reading this book, I was very pleased with the way the story kept my interest. Like most people, I enjoy romance novels because they have a way of transporting you to another place,time era ect. That's the main reason I especially enjoyed this reading by Monica Jackson. To me, this was a very good book and I would recommend to everyone."
1,"Looks poorer than the online picture, and cheaper than its price","I had planned to have it as gift to my friend, but when I received the product, I changed my mind. It doesn't look that good. The digital part is hard to read and it doesn't match the analog reading. Awful."
3,Pulsar Two Tone,"Nice watch, nice looking buy heavy, can't hear the alarm and the band is for a football player and needs adjusting-big time! I still like the watch for the price."
5,What an incredible after shave!!,"This product is amazing. It is the perfect ending to my shaving routine. It has a wonderful, cooling sensation that helps to even out and moisturize my face after i shave. I have got all my friends hooked on this product and they all love it as much as i do. It does exactly what it says and is pure shaved ice with no typical after shave balm burn. My skin has never looked or felt better due to this line of skincare. Take my advice, try their whole line of products. You will feel energized and everyone will notice the difference. Thanks, Billy!!"
3,its... ok,"Let me start by saying I love the Billy Jealousy Liquidsand cleanser. For that reason, plus the high reviews on this Shaved Ice balm, I decided to splurge and buy some. My experience has been that it is just ok - not great, not bad by any means - just ok. Like anything, it surely has to do with your preferences. For me, I like a creamy type of balm, one that soothes and moisturizes. This one is like a thin gel and just doesn't feel that great to me. It has a pleasant scent, but leaves me feeling like I just used hand sanitizer on my face. Furthermore, the ""shaved ice"" effect isn't what I expected -- it was very mild. I get MUCH more of a cooling sensation from Proraso pre/post cream, which is what I'd currently recommend."
5,Billy Jealousy Shaved Ice After-Shave Balm,"I ordered this aftershave balm because it had won a number of awards given out by Men's Health Magazine and I can see why! This balm smells great, and absorbs quickly and cools and sooths my face after shaving. The scent is citrus. The company donates a portion of its profits to what they call ""Human needs- the environment and the arts."" Nothing wrong with that! The seller Luxury4Him was unbelievable and they only took three days to deliver after my order, and the shipping/handling was free. Fantastic."
5,Awesome After-Shave,I've tried a number of premium products but I like this the best. It quickly cools and moisturizes my skin after shaving. It really feels like the cool rush you see on those Dentyne Ice commercials. I love it.
4,Surprised,"I was pleasantly surprised. The balm does have a cool sensation, but the citrus smell is wonderful. Given the lower price than department store balms, I was expecting to have to use more of it for each application. Not the case. It is indeed less expensive per application. I will use other balms to get variety, but Billy Jealousy Shaved Ice will continue to be part of my rotation."
1,Awful,"The entire story was a bore to me. The plot was contrived to the point of the ridiculous. The method used to 'execute' one of the characters impossible to carry off.The repitition of paragraphs of miles of text--re-worded--- put me in mind of an author desperate to stretch a short story or an essay into a multi-hundred page book to meet some deadline. This has been a routine complaint of mine for several authors.Short version: The story of Ripley was lightyears more believable, fun to read, and suspenseful."
2,I didn't like this,"I did think this was a little better than ""The Falcon & the Flower,"" the 1st in the series. I'm glad I read it or I wouldn't have understood the history as well. It was still too much history for me & not enough of the love story. I won't read the 3rd in the series. Overall I wish I hadn't wasted my time on reading either of them, but I already owned the 2nd so I felt like I ""had"" to read them."
5,The Dragon and the Jewel book,"I absolutely LOVED this book! I have read it atleast 5 times. I love the story of Simon and Eleanor. I agree with another person's review though. I also think that the story should have continued on to tell about Simon's later battles. If you love this story, you will also love ""The Falcon and the Flower"" by Virginia Henley, which precedes this book. I haven't read a Virginia Henley book that I haven't loved. ""The Pirate and the Pagan"" is also another favorite."
1,Don't like what happened to one of the characters in the sequel,"Spoiler Alert: Loved the book and then found out what happened to one of my favorite characters in the sequel - sorry you never do that in a romance novel. Went back and gave it 1 star. My advise is read this but if you like the main characters do not read the next book Marriage Prize. It's been a week since I read this book and even thought I haven't read the sequel, finding out what happened to my favorite character means I will never read the Marriage Prize. I was reading one of her books the other day and researched the book first to make sure the main character doesn't die later on. Not cool...in the words of Mr. Knightly in Emma ...""Badly Done"". I know she had to stay true to history but too much reality for me...."
2,Save some time- don't bother reading the second half.,"The story of the child bride blooming into the beautiful and intelligent wife of William was interesting, but her transformation into the willful, jealous and shallow Countess of Leicester is near painful. Some of her antics are reminiscent of a bad ""I Love Lucy"" episode. Other characters are very one dimensional and uninteresting."
1,Sadly disappointed,"I've been an avid Sci-fi/Fantasy reader for a long time. I'm one of those people who usually wouldn't go near the Romance aisle of the bookstore, but this book was on a countertop display. I made an impulse purchase, and now regret the waste of my (money). I found that despite her attempt at a strong, roguish leading man, the author ended up with the embodiment of why we needed the feminist movement. I found his behavior disgusting. I also disliked Eleanor intensely. Yes, I realize that she was royalty and spoiled etc., but after about 50 pages filled with whining and pouting, I just had to go talk with someone mildly interesting so I didn't go nuts. If this is a romance book, then apparently it isn't the genre for me."
1,Deception,"I gave them my 4Runner model information and they recommended to me this item but no coincide, well I lost my money because I live outside USA"
3,Boxed set wanted,"It was alright, but I would rather have a full 24 hour version from beginning to the end. Myself, I didn't know that when I turned my tv on at 6AM, (or whatever time it was) that I would be able to start seeing the countries from start to finish celebrating or I would have been prepared with video tapes. I also am driving myself nuts looking for all the states celebrating. Why can't it all be put on one boxed set?? The full 24 hrs. around the world and our own States, like philadephia did a great job!.. very impressive, now I'll never be able to see it again. :-((( I've called the stations, getting no where fast though. Everyone wants to make money, but they don't want to give us what we want!. If anyone hears of a boxed set coming out, by all means email me lynda@ptd.net"
5,A Great Read,This book was a great read. It's a well crafted story that kept me immersed from first page to last. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a surprisingly good western.
1,watchband,The watch is excellent although after careful review I would have preferred a different watchband and also a stopwatch function. It may have been my own mistake bur I wish the products would have more specific pictures of things like function and band types. Additionally being able to order different style bands would be awesome for the style I have.
3,Shame about the prejudice,"Interesting way of looking at Christianity, and for the most part pretty right-on in the way he approaches the faith and evangelism. A little disappointing however that he chooses to drop in so many little sexist remarks (God created Eve to tidy the place up??) and his dismissal of homosexuality as something which only happens in the form of one-night stands in bars was just ignorant - surprising considering the rest of his message was pretty good."
1,What has happened to Christianity?,"Chalk me up as one of those dumb ""fundamentalists"" that just doesn't get it. I thought the Bible was to be our authority of how we reached the world. It is sad to see so many people rate this book as being good when the author would talk about our Saviour like this...Page 30At this point in the story, God is thirty years of age and a classic underachiever with no wife, kids, stable career, or even much of a home. But apparently God is fun to hang with, because he and his posse get invited to a lot of parties, including a wedding, which is basically a week-long wine and dance party celebrating some lucky guy's attempt to get back to Genesis I and 2. This would be the first of Jesus' many parties.This is so wrong to talk about Jesus this way. People may like this book, but I believe God is not pleased."
2,"Interesting concept, poor execution","This is less a book about how the church relates to its' subjects, and more a long-winded write-up of Driscoll's life, views, slams on other churches, rampaging homophobia and so forth. There is also a heady undertow of misogyny; only a few pages into the book, he compares prostitutes to cattle, saying they are ""big dumb meat."" His assessment of other women is no less problematic. I make it a point to finish reading books, even the ones I don't like, but it was a straight up struggle to slog through this one. Avoid, avoid."
4,Loved this book!,"I just finished this book and highly recommend it! I bought it several months ago and did not have the inclination to read it until last Sunday - the only thing I could muster the energy for was sitting on the couch so I grabbed this off the bookshelf where it had, admittedly, been collecting some dust. Memoirs can be a little iffy, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But Kaplan is very talented at weaving in the melancholy with the sardonic, the optimistically humorous with the reaslistic drudgery that sometimes characterizes our day-to-day lives. I'm kind of surprised that she hasn't turned to fiction writing, given her skill at setting the scene and her smooth, clear rendering of the small details that make her stories come to life.This is a great beach book, not because it's such a quick read - which it is - but because it has more weight and substance than what you might otherwise pick up, without feeling heavy or preachy. Happy reading."
2,A disappointment,"I was hooked on this book when I first started reading it. The first few chapters were hilarious! I laughed out loud a few times during the first chapter alone. Then around the time she stopped talking about her childhood and moved on to her adult life, I lost interest. Very quickly. I began finding it a chore to finish each chapter. I would read a few pages, put it down, then not pick it up again for a couple of days. Usually I would finish a book of this length in one night, but it took me almost two weeks of on and off reading to complete it. I recommend that you do not pay for this book. If you think that it looks interesting, go to the library. I regret paying the small price that I did for it. I wouldn't want someone else to make the same mistake."
2,I don't get it.,"I have never written one of these reviews, but I was so dumbfounded by the attention for this book that I felt compelled.I have NO IDEA why Amazon mentions Cynthia Kaplan along with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs. As I read it, I kept thinking she's probably the sort of person who writes funny e-mails, so all her friends tell her, ""You should write a book.""I was mildly entertained and nothing more -- well, no, actually there *was* something more. There was white-hot rage that this profoundly mediocre book not only made it into print but had been RECOMMENDED as something I might like, which had me traipsing over to my favorite used-book retailer to pay $2 for it. Which was $2 too much for something so absolutely ordinary."
1,I didn't even finish this book.,"Okay, I ordered this book because it sounded funny and entertaining. I could never get into it...I guess I was looking for something more solid. I could never get hooked on it. There might have been a few things that made me smile, but overall I couldn't flip the pages fast enough. I read about 100 pages and then I just gave up. I mean what's the point of this book? Just because there might be a few funny things that happened to you in your life doesn't mean it will make a great memoir. I wouldn't recommend this book because I thought it was boring and there was never a moment where I felt compelled to keep reading."
1,Why I'm Like This...,"I can add this book to the list of books that I have started to read and cannot bring myself to finish. I ordered this book because the author was compared to David Sedaris (an author that I read because he was compared to Augusten Burroughs - who is the funniest) but found out that she is nothing like Sedaris unless you compare her to one of his earlier works-which are not funny either.Not only did I find this author unable to make me laugh, I did not smile once or even find a mildy amusing sentence. I cannot even give you an instance of a stupid anecdote because they are ALL so boring that I cannot remember one.Save your money - borrow from the library. I picked up ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" the other day and find it extremely interesting and well written - not funny but worth a look."
3,"It starts out really funny, but...........","The first half of this book I was laughing out loud at parts. Kaplan is a very witty writer and shockingly honest. The book does get a bit boring when she gets to the baby part though.The only thing I thought was downright not funny was the part where Kaplan writes about her days in summer camp being mean and bullyish to Lisa. Lisa was so shunned by Kaplan and her friends, that she ""let"" an adult camp counselor rape her. I got the feeling Kaplan hasn't grown up yet and feels no remorse over how Lisa was treated.But as a writer, Kaplan is talented and funny."
2,"funny, i guess.","I'm sort of unable to figure out why Cynthia Kaplan was asked to write this book. I mean, it's cute and amusing, but I always got the feeling she wanted for us all to be bowled over by her talent, which isn't at all overwhelming. In particular, the chapter where she discusses wanting to get pregnant, I could never stop thinking about her going through the experience and thinking about how she could best come up with a clever way to put it, for her book."
2,Good for New Mothers and Already Married Women,"As my title suggests, this is a ideal book for either young mothers, married women or both of the above, other than that, I could not stand her constant mentioning of how great her David/ the authors husband is. Oh my goodness it did not lighten up one bit. Please, spare me the intricate details of your happiness...as a near 30 year old woman myself who is practically terminally single and have had many more awkward moments than this woman has in two years I could certainly sell more books & keep single girls hopes up as well by writing my own tome as she has done. Again, great book if your married, a mommy and unbelievably happy with your life but it is certainly a let down if your in you are in limbo like me, waiting for the bad things to just let up a little bit in your daily life & you are eventually hoping to meet someone remotely interesting who is not already married, engaged or on Americas Most Wanted criminal list. A deflating book, pass."
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"Although this book was interesting and tried to delve into issues that make a person who they eventually turn out to be, in some cases I found myself skipping entire paragraphs due to the details. It was almost painful to keep reading on and on about one event...just didn't seem to add to the story. I did enjoy the book somewhat...not an entirely bad read."
2,"like this = self centered, shallow and annoying","A lot of this book was familiar to me having grown up in the Northeast. The embracing of the self centered, shallow and annoying character traits was exhausting. I kept waiting for her to pick up a mirror, say ""Ew"" and then gain at least desire for depth. Reading the acknowledgements made me want to slap those folks for encouraging her and myself for not noticing the ""USA Today"" aka McPaper was the source of the ""Knee-slapping hilarious"" review. I even paid full price for it!!!!"
3,Has its perks,"I liked this book more than I thought I would. She writes about family, love, teenage popularity, summer camp, motherhood, being a waitress/actress and grandparents. She's funny, witty, insightful and, at times, wise. Yes, there are times when she is shallow, self-absorbed and makes jokes that misses the mark, but she's never malicious and she pokes as much fun at herself as everyone else. A delightful little book that's not to be taken too seriously."
