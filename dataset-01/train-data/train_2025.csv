1,Not new puzzles,These puzzles are not new as stated on the front cover. I ordered them on 11/23 for a Christmas gift given on 12/25 so now I have had the game to long to return it. A useless purchase.
1,another bad movie,another bad Jim O'Rear movie he acts the same in ever film at least Christian Slater my act the same in all his films but he is easier on the eyes Jim please stop making films everyone now a days think they are a film maker or a actor to all the film makers if you do not make your money back on a film it is only a hobby the only one that is getting paid is people like JIM o'Rear
4,Overall Good,"This splitter did its job. However, if you have two devices plugged in, both need to be on and set on the input for the splitter, or neither device will work. That is inconvenient for me because I wanted to use it for my tv and computer at the same time. So right now, I just have the computer plugged in. Otherwise, it works well."
3,Worked great when needed,"Worked great when using both displays. However, if one of the displays is turned off it would create feedback artifacts on the other display. This may have been a result of cable lengths, but I did not take the time to debug the issue."
3,"Works well, but not for what I needed",I bought this to split my TV and Wacom tablet with my computer. It would send the signal to the TV just fine. But not to my Wacom. I couldn't get both to work on this splitter. I haven't tried to use it on two TV because I don't need it for that now. I'm not exactly sure if other splitters would have faired any better. So it just might be what I was trying to do this and the splitter just wasn't designed to do that. I'm rating it at 3 stars for those reasons.
2,Works.. but doesnt work.,"I was told I can plug this to my computer and output to two monitors with ease. I did it, however only one picked up, when I unplugged one the other will come up, and vise versa. I had an expert take a look at it as I thought it was more of a computer set up I needed to fix, but no. Just the adapter didn't work. But hey it does give me at least one display.. oh well."
1,Doesn't work,"Sent the first one back, because of a picture full of static. Second one did the same thing. Word to the wise, buy an HD TV with at least 4 HDMI connectors."
1,DOES NOT WORK,"This product quite simply does not work. As soon as you attach the 2nd cable (even with the source turned OFF), the signal gets scrambled. A big waste of money."
1,buy another splitter,if you're buying this for the same reason i did (which is obvious) it just lacks in quality. buy something else. i should have read reviews before i bought this.
1,Not clear that this doesn't extend displays...,"... it only allows for cloning. The problem is in the terminology - ""splitter"" could be taken to mean ""it splits one port into two ports with identical signals"" or could also be taken to mean ""it splits one port into two ports with separate signals"".The listing should specify whether it allows for extending displays (takes the two sets of digital connections of one DVI port and splits them into two ports) or only allows for cloning (just taking one of the two digital connections in the DVI port and wiring that up to both of the ports). While this is the Windows terminology, and DVI is OS independent, it would save a whole lot of confusion and disappointment."
2,"A ""Practical"" (??) guide","The title of this book indicates that it has some some of how-to information in it. But that is not the case at all. It has lots of information on the nutrient solution, but it not really helpfull if you are buying yours premixed.The book totally lacks conclusions that is needed for decisions when setting up you own system. In other words not a how-to book, so only two stars since I'm so disappointed"
2,SHREDDED,"Amazing - I read so many reviews about the paper being torn but I could not believe that it would be so consistent, so given that I could use Amazon prime I still went with this order. It was shredded in the packaging - the packaging was not torn, so it was put in this way. There were about 8 tears that went fairly deep, rendering much of it useless. It's nice paper, so I will still order the brand, but someone is doing something wrong along the way and they need to fix it. On to Adorama or B&H."
5,See Review of Season 2,"I bought Season 1 of Sanctuary, to fill in the story line, since I had not seen the beginning of the series. My review of Season 2 covers my reasons for choosing to purchase Season 1.This is a well written series, with plenty of plot twists and turns to keep the watcher's attention, and a great underlying message about how we treat those who may be different. Not a new message, but one worth repeating until it's heard."
3,So-so,"After watching Warehouse 13 I was looking for another fun SciFi V series, so I thought I will give Sanctuary a go. It misses substance and is too dark a series to enjoy in my view. I watched the first 5 or so episodes of Season 1 after I moved on to Haven."
5,Sanctuary season is great.,I enjoyed watching the complete first season of Santuary because it brought me up to speed on the series because I had missed some eposides.
2,Not what I was hoping,"I was hopping that this was the season with all discs in a sleeve of some sort. Oh well, you get what you paid for."
2,Problems with dvd,Dvd freezes at certain places. Returned set and got new set. New set also freezes at same spot on same dvd. Some DVD's ok. Some Not.
2,boring,"Admittedly I could not make it past the first 30 minutes, so this review doesn't reflect the show as a whole.I'm a huge fan of Stargate and Dark Angel so I figured this was worth a try. I like Amanda Tapping but her English accent is unbearable and the show just took FOREVER to introduce the few characters that I did see. the main character is mediocre and I just couldn't take it anymore.Maybe I'll give it another chance later if it doesn't die."
2,I hate wait until next year endings,"I bought this product because the premise sounded interesting. It still is and while the actors were good in their parts, in my opinion, with the exception of a few episodes, the series didn't live up to its potential. AND I hate shows that end a year with wait until next year before you can get closure. What happens if the show is cancelled?I won't be watching season two. Season one didn't do enough for me to hold my interest."
3,Amazon.com Bargains,The quality of Amazon.com is always top of the line. The only thing that really upsets me is that whenever I purchase over 2 items when my account is charged Amazon.com comes out with a special on those specific items. Example: I just ordered and received Sanctuary: The complete first season $24.99 and The Hunger: The Complete first season $34.99. Now I get a message that this 2 DVDs are now offered for the two for $44.99. That is $14.99 cheaper than what I paid. Why wasn't I notified that some of those items would be going on sale? This has happened before. Has it ever happened to you?
1,Do not spend money on this one!,"We just finished Fringe and True Blood and while we wait for the 2 seasons to come on dvd, we bought Sanctuary. What a waiste of money. Horrible low budget, poor acting and the story is just too thin!!! The effects are not good and we could not finish the first hour. We just gave up."
5,"Fantastic Series, Remarkable Actors.","This Series Give You Something Different On Every Single Show, ans As Always Amanda Trapping Puts In A Stellar Performace Along With The Rest Of Her Crew! The entire show borders on reality, with the saving of rare creatures, and their species. It's About Time I Say! If This Show Were To Get Even A Few More To Think About Saving even One creature, Then in my opinion it has done its job. Just watch an episode or two, and then you will see it is great!Please EnjoyBrian R."
3,Haven't watched all of it yet.,"Jury still out. Not a driven cast and the story kinda spill secrets all over the place. Only episode 3 and everyone's history has been told and secret fathers, etc,etc. Arcs you would expect to last a whole season are abbreviated and resolved in one episode."
3,Weak,"The CG is amateurish and the acting is OK. Canada is trying,like with Murdoch Mysteries, but I bought one set, no more"
2,Dissatisified with product,"I absolutely love the show and the different creatures displayed on the show.I however was disappointed the way the dvds were packaged by using a different way to hold dvds in the tray.The company should have used the old format with the center hub to push the dvds out of plastic tray.The other disappointment was the 5.1 audio broadcast,because I had to literally turn the volume up to a ridicilous level just to hear the voices.The other bluray dvds I bought and own never had that problem,I have a bluray home theater and had to turn the volume to 25,while the other dvds was load at volume 20+.In my opinion the manufacture should go back and redo the complete set to satisfy the consumer considering the cost of the set.Best Buy does offer the set for $29.99 and season 1 for $32.99 but with the inferior product you still aren't getting the best product for the price anyway.Dissatisfied customer,Michael Lee/Denver"
2,Not very interesting,"Maybe I didn't give it long enough. Admittedly, I've watched only five episodes of the first season, but while watching I can't resist the impulse to go do something else. The show just does not hold my interest. The characters are likable, but not in a way that makes me care what they do next."
3,CG Could be better,"I have recently watched the new series with Amanda Tapping ""Sanctuary"" I think it has the possibility to be a good show, with some great ideas, felt a little weird listening to Amanda with an english accent, but wasnt too bad. Only thing that i would mention is that I think that by now CG work would be a whole lot better, being associated with those who worked on Stargate, the CG work was a little sloppy and if it was such a good idea to do so much green screen stuff, it looks a little amatuerish, would love to see it in more a live stage situation and less CG orientated stuff. But characters all seem good and look forward to seeing where it goes.Mr B"
1,Awful just awful,"As a major lover of British TV, I was so looking forward to this series. Awful is really not an accurate enough term to describe it. Fake, unrealistic, self-important. Awful, just awful."
3,Ludicrous entertainment,"First, it's compelling. Sure, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense - a staff of what, five or so? The action sequences, especially shootouts, are poorly done - Magnus just stands there shooting, for the most part. Ludicrous. The CGI, at least in this season, is not great, but it's the stories that carry you along - some are quite surprising and complex, especially the one with Drawing Boy. The characters are great fun and well written, what with the James (Sherlock) Watson and Jack the Ripper and company. I wish they didn't kill off main characters with such frequency, but it sure makes for real suspense."
4,If you like History you will love this show,This show does a great job of incorporating history into the storyline. The cast is awsome and the plot and episodes are too. Two thumbs up!!
4,great,"I live in the netherlands and have seen sanctuary for the first time on SCFI_europe , its a great story with good actors. In the future i will definetly buy other seasons of this."
2,Intelligent and well-done?,"A friend recommended this, saying it was the best of the genre he'd seen. I skipped to the Tesla episode to give it a fair try; the only way it could be seen as intelligent, perhaps, is by comparing it to earlier episodes."
3,"Good, but not great","I decided to check this out, having seen Amanda Tapping's work on Stargate Atlantis. There's no denying the concept for the series is interesting, but it drags its way through many episodes. Plus, it relies a bit too much on the makeup gimmicks that helped sink the second season of ""Dark Angel"" (Remember the dopey looking half man half dog? Well, Sanctuary has one, too, and he feels just as fake.) I recommend scify fans check out season one, but don't buy it. Otherwise, it will fill space in your closet best reserved for really good DVDs."
3,Pleasantly Surprised,"Not having cable, I decided to take a chance on the show. I thoroughly enjoyed the mix of detective style drama and supernatural. I would recommend this to fans of either genre."
3,Could go either way...,"Having only seen Ms. Tapping in the Stargate series (followed it for maybe a season and a half), I was quite impressed with her role here. She does quite well and carries the show through its rough start. Season One ended stronger than it started, but Season Two will really determine whether watching this season was worth it.For Tapping fanboys, this would be a ""must buy"", as she really is impressive."
3,Decent CGI Show,"First, let me say that I am not a big fan of CGI. Honestly, there have been some movies and tv shows that use CGI well. However, they are few and far between. The CGI, and green screen effects, used on this show are okay. It's not bad, but it could honestly be a lot better. I must admit, however, that the story line of the entire season is great. However if it weren't for the story line, I wouldn't have watched the entire season. This is why I gave this season a 3 star rating."
2,Sanctuary Season One,"I am a great fan of the SciFi genre and especially of Stargate and Stargate Atlantis.Unfortunately, Amanda Tapping does not shine in this series. The accent that she affects is very off-putting. The individual shows are very slow to develop and don't have very much oomph.The series saving grace is the fact that it is shot entirely in front of a green screen but has not overwhelmed viewers. In fact, most times you forget that it the show is so heavily special effects. Although, even some of those special effects are questionable. The mermaid is slightly fuzzy and doesn't appear to focus on the person she is interacting with.I'm hoping that the second season will improve but if it doesn't this will mean that I won't be returning.Sanctuary: The Complete First Season"
2,Torchwood 'wanna-be',"The premise for Sanctuary is exactly the same as the British series ""Torchwood"" and very similar to ""Threshold"" another ""let's protect the aliens among us from the bad US Gov't"" show. If that topic appeals to you then you might like this show. The characters are all likeable but I found the stories slow, and uninvolving--its just a matter of taste. I cancelled my order for season 2 about halfway thru watching season 1 as their are just too many good shows out there to watch something that's just ""tepid""."
1,"Horrible--deserves a ""zero"" star","I really, really wanted to like this series, but it's just too cheesy. Bad acting, bad special effects (beyond bad) and plots that are so thin you can predict each step along the way. Season 1 was worse than Season 2, but it's like comparing two piles of garbage that are rotting in the sun...which one smells worse?It was a terrific concept (santuary for all) that was executed poorly. In Season 2, Will seems to be told ""ok, act tough here"" so he leaves his lower lip hanging as though seeing his teeth tells us that he's now a rough and buff toughie.Don't waste your money on this one."
4,"Good Bounce, Good Stand","The stand is solid and easy to move around the house and practice wherever.The pad can be a little loud (not nearly as loud as my snare drums) but it does make sound which can be loud, depending on how hard you're hitting/playing it.10 inch size is a good size for me as I am practicing hitting it on the same place (center) every time. It was recommended to me by another drummer."
4,drum pad,I have 6 year old son and he's really enjoying the drum pad . Now he don't have to worry about him on our pots and pans .
3,Why double sided?,"The house DVD set for season one is on double sided discs, I am sure that this was to save money, not only is it confusing, but is very easy to scratch. This is the only reason for the rating of 3. As for the price that I got it for and the hours of hilarious entertainment that I got from it, it was worth it. Hugh Laurie with his quick wit and candor is something I wish existed in the world more, especially with doctors."
1,House season one,"I got season one and four and both of them skipped through the whole season, I miss half the season if not more cause the disc were scratched and skipped alot"
5,Fantastic,This DVD box set of season one of house was remarkable! Everything from the box to the playability of the DVDs were excellent. I would recommend purchasing any DVDs on your want list from Amazon!
2,Not anamorphic widescreen!,"Although mentioned other places, I think this needs highlighting - the House episodes are NOT presented in anamorphic widescreen. That means if you have a widescreen TV, you get letterbox on all four sides of a small picture - letterbox on the sides because the pictures on the DVDs is really 4:3 (not 16:9), and letterbox on the top and bottom because it's part of the DVD picture. Some widescreen TVs can ""zoom"" this to fill a widescreen TV, but you're just throwing away resolution that way.It's even more insulting because the MENUS are anamorphic widescreen! The quality of the over-the-air HDTV broadcasts are much better than this DVD set. Had I known it was not anamorphic, I would not have purchased it. Very, very disappointing offering from Universal in 2005."
4,I Heart House,"I love House, but the special features section is a bit sparse. Otherwise, a great addition for anyones collection."
5,An Amazing Show,"House is, as my title says, an amazing show. I, like all the other people who have written reviews here, am sick and tired of cheesy sitcoms, so I never watch TV. But one night I happened to catch House, and I was instantly addicted. Hugh Laurie is wonderful as Dr. House, a man you hate to love, because he's so cynical, but you have to feel bad for him. The show treats the viewer as an intelligent being (concept?), and is refreshingly funny and touching in turns. The supporting characters are well-cast and excellently thought out. They are a diverse group from different backgrounds, but unlike other shows, they are not exaggerated characters from bizzare walks of life...who all just happen to be doctors. The show moves quickly enough to be entertaining, without losing credibility, and slowly enough to give you time to enjoy character development, but not so slow that it becomes boring. Without a doubt, my favorite show. The first-season DVD is definitely worth it."
3,"Could be better, but okay","The plot line was perfect, the drama was fast paced but could be better. All creative vehicle like serial dramas always plummet and run out of ideas. The stories are very predictive, except for the diagnosis and there are no history to Dr. House's colleagues.Please, divert a little in the up comming season- The stories are simple- it simply tells us an infectious disease is discovered, Dr House and his team cures it after troubleshooting the issue.Let's see better story lines. Remember there is no fahion statement, no real beauty to hold attention- please lets get something rivetting and mind blowing, something that will keep the audience racing for more.Well I have not finished the complete 1st season, because it does not attract me to watch more episodes. well, it's a good one if compared with the likes of ER, Chicago Hope, then it surely rates first class and unique."
3,"Entertaining, but why so expensive?","I have not purchased the DVD. I rented it for about $2.50 from the video shop. House, MD Season One consisted of only about 5 episodes. Why is it so expensive to buy? If you haven't viewed the first season, save yourself some money and borrow a copy from the library or pay a small amount to rent it for a couple of nights. I'm crazy about Hugh Laurie (who plays Dr. Gregory House) and have very fond memories of his role as Bertie Wooster in the ""Jeeves"" series. He's pretty wonderful here as well but since I know my way around hosptials I gag over the situations depicted in this fictitious medical center. I just have to keep saying to myself, ""It's only entertainment"". Then I calm down, am no longer nauseated and am well entertained."
4,Worth one's time,"The personality of the main character, Dr. House, is a breather from having to be PC all the time and it based on the notion of being brutally honest. That the main character does not make allowances for diplomacy is based on the notion that he has no time for stupidity. Therefore some people find House tiring and overly caustic, but it makes for great entertainment. The medical info is always challenging and I enjoy googling it afterwards. The series is one of the more intelligent ones on TV and one can actually learn from it."
1,house first season video Amazon Verified Purchase,Very poor video quality. It will not play on a blue ray player. Locks up requiring a restart several times while playing.
5,"Great puzzling cases, thrilling moments, I love it","The guy who knows everything, but is wrong often enough to keep us all guessing. I enjoy the contrast of House and his cadre of young fresh faced colleagues, complete with starched white lab coats, who struggle as much with their professionally imposed constraints, and sense of decorum, as they do with his personality."
5,House in a breath of fresh air,"I have not watched t.v. since I was a child beause of the lack of talent and lack of interesting plots. House delivers both. Very witty dialogue, cast works great together, I have been hooked since the first episode!"
4,good show,This is one of the best-if not THE best-medical drama in years. Hugh Laurie is brilliant in the title role. He plays the cynical Dr. House to perfection. Try to imagine Ted Danson's Becker as a dramatic character. He also works brilliantly with the other characters in an impressive cast. House's brilliant yet flawed character will be very memorable. I am glad I got this collection to catch up on it.
3,House Season One,DVD was fine - just a bit overpriced as only a week latter - the same DVD set and seasons 2 and 3 were on sale at Target for $24.99I overpaid for the DVD by $10.00. This is the last time that I will purchase DVD from Amazon.
1,NO SUBTITLES,Do not buy this - this has no english subtitles. How can we with hearing impairment or hard of hearing can follow this excellent series without subtitles.Very annoyed buyer. - got refund though!
4,Great show deserved better DVD treatment..,"This review is for the DVD set. I give it 3.5 stars because the episodes are not shown in anamorphic widescreen, and the special features are lacking. I got this set as a gift, but if no one had given it to me, I'd have still bought it because I'm a House addict. The special features are good, but very short so there aren't enough of them. It's great that I now own the DVDs of one of my favorite shows, but I hope there is a better re-release of this season in the future."
4,Taken with a grain of salt,"While my interest in the show definitely transcends a simple enjoyment of fluff, it is important to take all situations and characters with a grain of salt. It impossible for a character like House never exist in the real medical world. For instance, a relationship like the one he has with Cuddy, though realistic, would never actually occur between a doctor, however brilliant, and his boss. It would be interesting to research how accurate some of the strictly medical scenarios on the show are."
1,Horrible show... fans of this have no clue what good TV is. Check out Jersey Shore instead...,"Sup sup y'all.... I love good tv shows and movies just like everyone else these days but last week someone really irritated me when they said 'Jersey Shore' was a dumb show and I should watch good tv shows like 'House'...So I hopped on my netflix account and lookd for this show...Oh lord! This should'nt even be considered a TV Series!Take my advice.... avoid this show and stick with good television series like ""Jersey Shore"" and any of those MTV teen mom shows.. if you want good TV viewing.. peace out folks!"
1,Do not buy if you have a 16/9 TV,The video contained on this DVD set is NOT anamorphic. It will not fill the screen of your 16/9 tv properly without zooming on the image. A very sloppy release. My review is not a statement on the show itself but on this poor dvd release.
5,House Season One in Anamorphic Widescreen,"Ok, you may have read that House: Season One originally was released without being properly formatted for widescreen TVs. This is true. However, search on Amazon for House Season One and you will get two matches. One is released on August 30th, 2005 and the other on February 10th, 2009! The one released in 2009 is a repackaged anamorphic version. This is the one EVERYBODY should buy, because even if you still use an old tv, someday you'll get a widescreen tv, or loan this set to somebody who does. Either way, the quality is better"
5,Wow-mazing!,"House is by far the most mind bending and completely unpredictable show on tv today...that's why I think its ""wow-mazing""!"
5,Sarcasm At Its Best!,"Have you ever been to see a doctor who was probly one of the rudest people you have ever met? Well I'm sure that he/she has nothing on Dr. House. Dr. Gregory House is both loathed for his blunt comments but also loved for his incredible knowledge of the human body and how people are. He can basically do what he wants because he is so good at what he does that the hospital he works for just looks the other way. I loved this show from the moment I saw it, although I did not like the character House. After seeing all of the episodes in season 1, I have learned to appreciate his sometimes twisted point of view. His motto is everybody lies. Many of his patients insist they are telling the truth, but they find themselves telling the real truth if it means they could die. This series is suspenceful, witty, and brilliant. I love anything dealing with health & medicine, but this show takes it way beyond that. You'll soon find yourself loving loathable house."
5,Best written show on TV!,"What's not to love about this show? Great writing, great acting, and the most delightfully snarky protagonist you can imagine. OK, the medicine is sometimes a bit off, and occasionally story arcs persist a bit longer than necessary (eg., the Vogler entanglement). But the show is smart and funny, and assumes its viewers are not idiots. And Hugh Laurie, in the title role, is absolutely compelling.The added features are fun -- interviews, tour of the set. The only thing that was not included, that I wish was included, was the unaired version of the pilot episode. As you may recall, DVDs of the pilot were distributed in TV Guides, and these versions of the pilot contained some scenes that were not in the aired pilot. Not a big deal, but it would have been an obvious choice for a special feature -- if not the whole episode, then at least the deleted scenes."
5,More Addicting Than Vicodin,"I have just recently become interested in the show - I've only seen a few episodes of the second season, but that was all it took to get me hooked. Between that and watching the season one reruns on USA, I knew this show was awesome. My sister bought me the first season on DVD as a graduation present and I watched it all in marathon style - it just gets better and better! I like this show for the relationships, dry humor, and just different perspective on the whole medicine field. It has yet to turn into a soap oprea like Grey's Anatomy, but allows you to get to know the characters more than on ER which seems to have a new cast every episode. It's just awesome. I HIGHLY reccommend it; you will NOT be disappointed."
5,Brilliant medical show,"I just graduated from medical school, and my classmates and I thoroughly enjoyed this show (although we recognized that a team of doctors having only one patient for an entire week or so was ridiculously unrealistic!) But the extra time that the lack of patients allows for good character development (or great, in the case of Dr. House). Most of all, I like that the show's creators have created a character that demonstrates that a doctor doesn't need to be a perfect person to be an excellent physician - Dr. House is devoted, damaged, chronically ill, heroic, and a brilliant and effective doctor, all at the same time. THAT is my favorite thing about this show."
5,Favorite Show,"House is one of my favorite shows. =)DVD version is not as clear as HDTV, but it is great not having to worry about commercials."
4,Maybe too much,"The show's plots start to look alike toward the season's end. In addition, the sarcasm gets tougher week after week--cruel more than funny."
5,House Season One,Highly recommend this series and any of the others. I truly love this show and would highly recommend it to anyone.
5,Well worth it.,"This show is just so good all on it's own but to watch it in high def is even better. The only issue I had was that it changed from high def to low def a few times more than I expected it to. All in all, a great purchase."
4,Great Stuff!,"I bought the collection to fill in the episodes I missed, but the added material alone was worth the price. Hugh Laurie's audition session is amazing. Of course, just listening to him speak naturally with his English accent is spooky."
2,Widescreen Screw-up,"House is a great show and Hugh Laurie gives us one of the most interesting characters since Jeremy Brett's Sherlock Holmes. So why did Universal give the DVD release such slipshod treatment?The series was shot in High-Definition. The DVD box is labeled ""Widescreen 1.78:1"". Yet these DVDs are scaled down to the width of a 4:3 picture, losing 36% of the visual detail of an anamorphic DVD. The video looks like a postage stamp on widescreen TVs--thick black borders on all four sides!. What were they thinking? Was this a technical screw-up or was Universal so desperate to squeeze it onto three DVD's that they just threw quality out the window? I can't believe executive producer Bryan Singer would have signed off on this."
1,Can't believe people are supporting this!,"It blows my mind that people would encourage Universal's carelessness by buying this inferior product. I love the show and cannot express how deeply dissapointed I am that Universal did not bother to make this anamorphic widescreen. There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of laziness in this day and age. Anamorphic content has been available for OVER A DECADE NOW! Furthermore, it costs the studio nothing to process the video in this manner and it creates a better picture for everyone (not just 16x9 TV owners).If you are a fan of the series, do everyone a favor and don't cave and buy this DVD set until they release it in IT'S ORIGINAL (AND INTENDED) FORMAT!!"
1,Widescreen owners BEWARE!,"Anyone planning on watching this on an HDTV or other widescreen needs to know that season 1 was issued as 4:3 letterbox DVDs. This means that instead of filling your screen, the picture will be the proper ratio only taking up about the middle 3rd of your screen. Otherwise, it will be stretched too far wide.Also, maybe I'm just sooo used to the HD on TV, but the quality of this master is horrible. All of my other movie DVDs look much better. There is very noticable noise in the blacks (and all colors) on season 1. I should note that my setup is calibrated and I have NO macroblocking issues.It is a HUGE SHAME that they butchered such a fantastic series when putting it on DVD. I'd rather watch a 4:3 Seinfeld on my HDTV anyday. Pray they release it on BR/HD or download HR rips online (after all, you own those episodes!)."
5,DR. HOUSE IS HOT,Thanks for offering the best TV show ever on TV. I wish I could find a real doctor as hot as House!! Thanks Amazon!!!
3,House Season 1,Don't know. I never received it but it was returned to Amazon by whoever did receive it. I'm sure it would have been great.
1,Letterbox not Anamorphic Widescreen,Letterbox only not Anamorphic Widescreen. I will rather wait for their proper format release.
3,Bad News for Widescreen TV Owners,"Just to make something clear that isn't really obvious in the item description (or on the packaging itself)--the show is presented here in non-anamorphic widescreen. That is, it is NOT formatted for viewing on a widescreen television. Viewing on a 16 X 9 widescreen TV, you will have to choose between a picture that is distorted and stretched horizontally or one that has black bars on all four sides--top, bottom, left and right. Sadly, Universal's unfortunate and outdated decision has caused the quality of this DVD set to suffer."
2,"Great show, hate the box set though","I love House. It's a great show, but I'm not here to review the show. I'm here to talk about the season 1 box set. I was lucky to get it for an excellent bargain, because now that I have it I'm a little miffed. My major complaint is that these are double sided discs. They are so very easy to scratch. It's hard to hold the dvds without touching at least one side of them. I've already gotten a tiny scratch on one of the discs that now makes one scene skip. I don't even know how it happened. My advice is not to buy these until you have the capability of copying them. Then I would store away the originals. I hope with future releases they will have normal one-sided discs. My other (much smaller) complaint is that there is a lack of bonus materials. There are some, but I was hoping for a little more. It's a great show though; there's no doubt about that."
5,House MD rocks!,House is one of the best shows on tv today. My son and all his college age friends are addicted to the series. They enjoy watching the DVD as many of them are too busy with college and studying that they can't watch when the episode is aired on FOX. Great TV Series!
5,Love it!,"We only started watching this show recently, so having the whole first season has been great!"
3,"Like ""Quincy"" meets ""C.S.I."" in the ""E.R.""","Fans of ""E.R."" and ""C.S.I."" might find that ""House"" is the perfect intersection of their interests. A drama with a sense of humor, this show is a wonderful mix of all that makes up life, and with Laurie in the lead role, its well-acted to boot. The DVDs have to be labeled as disappointing, thanks to the non-anamorphic transfers and minor extras, even if the show itself is great and it looks and sounds very good. If you're a fan, you'll want to own these episodes, and if you've never seen ""House,"" you'll want to give it a look, as it's one of the best shows out there."
5,The best show on TV,"This is the best show on TV right now. It has great acting, great writing and a skewed timeline *g* Hugh Laurie is great playing Dr. Gregory House, a cranky middle-age man with a ""Vicodin Plan"". He doesn't care about the patients (or so he says) but is always intrigued by the diseases. The DVDs are excellent. Three Stories, Detox and The Socratic Method are three of my favorite episodes and I'm very pleased to be able to watch those episodes with DVD quality. I was expecting more Bonus Materials though, like outtakes or something. I can't wait for the next season!"
3,House M.D. Series 1,"Wonderful star, witty scripts, but the same story every time -- Dr. House comes up against some mystery sickness, and after three wrong diagnoses, gets the answer right and saves the life of the patient. Hugh Lawry is capable of much more than this, so the writers should pull up their socks and give him storylines that are not only witty, but also less repetetive."
5,Not your Run-of-the-mill Medical Show,"Doctor shows are a dime a dozen. What sets this one apart is the acting! Hugh Laurie can say more without using any words at all than a boatload of your usual TV fare. I've loved him as a comic actor - who'd have guessed that his real talent was DRAMA?!His talents aren't limited to acting - check out his first novel ""The Gun Seller"" a strange blend of comedy/thriller. It's available on Amazon.(Be warned though - the price for a paperback is outrageous!) And I hear he has another book due out next year. What talent!"
4,Addicting!,"I watch this show all the time now that I have the dvds. I am hooked! This order arrived promptly, was inexpensive and exactly as described! I was very pleased! Thanks!"
5,HOUSE SEASON ONE,ANYTHING WITH HOUSE IS GOOD I WISH HE WAS MY DOCTOR QUESTION FOR YOU WHO ON HOUSE HAS SAVED THE MOST LIVES? RICHARD SKAADEN
2,NOT new as advertised by Amazon.com,"This season of House MD was advertised as new by Amazon.com. The case was beat up pretty bad, it was obviously used. Be cautious when buy DVDS from Amazon. The product was also sold by Amazon not a user seller."
5,house dvd,I started watching this show in the second season and I really enjoyed it. I didn't know if the first season would have been very different. It really wasn't even from the first show. Just got to enjoy more episodes of one of my favorite shows.
5,"commentary about Dr. House, the series","The program is just amazing in the fidelity and accuracy of the medical details, so much that I am using it as a review for diagnosis of medical disorders.It is really like be present during a staff meeting for many diseases, including some of them that are not very well known by most physicians. It is just wonderful.Highly recommended for physicians who wish to improve themselves."
5,House is great,"Despite some geographic inconsistencies (as a former NJ resident, trees will not still have green leaves in November), the show is well written, well acted and Dr House is quite comical. Highly recommended!!"
4,Best of the best,"it's amazing.An exciting series, with a lot of adrenaline and suspense at all times. the quality of video is very good. The first actor shines at all times and suggests some uncertainty about their appearance."
3,Could be better,"The quality of the video could be better, other than that it is an OK box set, nothing really special about it that stands out."
2,Quality control is poor,"We listened to the first two episodes of ""Dr. House"". On each there was evidence of scratches on the surface of the DVD (there was hesitation in the video). Rather disappointing for a virgin product."
5,House MD,"absolutely loved it. once i started watching the beginning, i was instantly hooked, and addicted. i watched the whole series in about four days. as a medical student, i love all of the mystery and pathology, without the drama as such series like ER and Greys Anatomy. i would highly recommend this item to any future doctor! if you have any questions please contact me about the item! id love to give anyone my input!"
5,Addicted to this Show,"It takes a lot to get me addicted to anything on television. I barely ever turn the tv on, but this show is just such a great blend of dialogue and storyline highlighted by Laurie's brilliant performance week after week that I can't stop myself. I haven't yet purchased the dvd, so I can't speak for the quality, but I can speak for the quality of the show. It's worth it (I say as I hit the button to complete my purchase)."
5,"my teen age daughter's charmed by House and I like it, too.","I had never heard of Dr. House, but was introduced by my 14 year old daughter. The acerbic humor, dark wit, quick back and forth and medical diagnostic puzzles are engaging and fascinate my daughter and her friends. House is an anti-hero, rather sophisticated and establishment-challenging. Cliches frequently get poked at, if not punctured, in the course of the show. It's interesting to have a key character who is in chronic pain, addicted to meds., highly intelligent, morose and neurotic. Other characters are shown to have facades; they lie, and they cope with life in a relatively probing, morally complex and conflicted way. It's a more thoughtful show than I've seen in a while."
2,"4 stars for show, 2 for dvd set","I love this show. The second season was a 5 star as far as I'm concerned. The writing and the acting is tremendous, and if grading on a curve, it's perfect to me. The dvd package seems very good but those double-sided dvds just didn't play well and have already given out on us after a few viewings. NO GOOD FOLKS. I have the second season on the way, I think they are one sided so hopefully that won't be a problem. I can't recommend this 1st season set though. Cross tape or burn copies. They don't last. I just wanted to say that and leave the actual ep to ep guide to other reviewers."
4,"Great Show, Bad Format","OK, explain this to me. You take the time to remix the show into 5.1 surround, but you only provide a letterboxed widescreen, not anamorphic? You heard me right, this is not in anamorphic widescreen. What was the thinking there? I realize the lead actor is from England, but do we need to use British production values to make him feel at home? Nevertheless, the content is wonderful, so you really can't help but buy the DVD anyway."
3,"Great Series, Poor Quality","This is one of my favorite TV series. I would easily rate this as 5 star. Unfortunately the DVD Quality is poor, that is, not really anamorphic widescreen. Well, at least it doesn't look that way. I watch the show on HD widescreen every week, and the picture quality is amazing. But here, the video quality cannot compare. Its presented in letterbox widescreen, and images are stretched out. Other series I've owned/watched, including Alias, 24, Lost, etc.., the quality difference/drop between the series and HD is not really that noticeable.So its a big disappointment. If you're watching this on square tv, maybe its not that bad. But if you're used to the widescreen treament, its sad. I certainly hope subsequent seasons of this show are treated better..."
5,"Great show, greater star","This new drama has it all: strong story-telling, complex and witty scripts, intelligent acting by a roster of compelling performers, and a gutsy, mesmerizing turn by British actor Hugh Laurie in the title role. Unlike most of the scripted shows on TV this season, House commands your full attention, rewards repeat viewings, and leaves you breathless with its courageous combination of humor and drama. Get this, get addicted."
3,Great show but BSwidescreen is annoying,"I'm happy to watch these DVDs because I enjoy the show immensely, but I've reduced my rating in protest of what I call BSWidescreen, where they have delivered a letterboxed 4:3 image rather than an anamorphic widescreen disc. To label the product ""widescreen"" is BS and a ripoff. Sure, we can fill our screen up by using the ZOOM mode, but then we are watching a lower resolution picture and the top and bottom picture clipping will be imperfect on some TVs. Too bad, since the show is otherwise good."
2,No holds barred,"If you hate political correctness,love dark humour and believe every [...]has a golden heart,this is the series for you.Amazing that such a product came out of the current climate-because most producers would be very careful with the blunt,opinionated dialogue and the crusty character of House,a brilliant,bitter ,diagnostician.He watches General Hospital in his spare time,loves rock music and torturing his highly educated interns.Half the time I kept thinking that this is the doctor I would like to have...the other half I dreaded meeting someone like him at the hospital.Totally original.."
2,slow delivery at express prices,"Ordered the DVD as an out-of-state gift. I paid for expedited shipping, but the package took 11 days to arrive. Even then, it was addressed to my name, not the recipient's I gave in the shipping address. I wouldn't use this vendor again."
2,Still Waiting,This seller is great and I know it is Christmas time but I am still waiting for disk one
5,"Great series, great price!","My son and I are House addicts. For his birthday I bought him the first season...so I can watch it, too! Great price! Great gift!"
5,House,I love the show! I can't wait to see the other seasons!! This is a must have for any House fan!!
4,House will work it out!!!!,"House is the doctor I want when I go to a hospital. I enjoyed it alot, only one gripe is that every episode seems to run on the same baseline, someone is sick, then they seem to get better, then they have a cardiac arrest, then they nearly die, but then then House saves the day. But still would recommend it highly."
5,Get Ready to be Addicted,"Powerful and interesting medical drama, smart comedy, and many diverse running subplots make this one of the best television shows to ever grace the airwaves. I am still surprised at the number of people I know who have never watched House. Once they've seen a few episodes from this DVD they're hopelessly addicted. We spent a good part of the holiday season watching all of the episodes from seasons 1 and 2. I don't watch much TV anymore, and when I do I shy away from the major traditional networks with so many other choices on cable in this day and age. Shows like this give back new credibility to the networks. There is a perfect chemistry working with all of the actors involved. The only reason I've heard that make people dislike this show is that they have a problem with House's personality, which happens to be the funniest part of the whole show."
5,"The Doctor is in, but are you sure you want to meet him?","Given as a gift for my spouse, I never thought I would become so attached to the series. My first thought was, ""great, a surgery show"" but turned out to be quite interesting. What Dr. House lacks in bedside manner he makes up for with mental acuity. He's the Sherlock Holmes of the medicine world and isn't afraid to cross the line now and then to get the answers to save someone's life. Best part of all - no commercials!"
5,House Rocks the House,"I absolutely love the House, M.D. series! The first season starts off rolling and doesn't stop. The season finale'... it'll leave you hangin' on the edge of your seat, so excited, you can barely get the season two disc one in your DVD player! I love it!! Only minor downfall... I'm not a big fan of the doublesided DVD's, however that was changed to single sided discs in season two."
2,not a bathing suit!,"We ordered this for my son, who has a summer job as a lifeguard. He has other Speedo suits which seemed to be of good quality. This one was very disappointing! Cheap fabric quality with no mesh liner. We returned it immediately and ordered from Lands End."
3,Tarp Clips?,Did not work as expected but may need some experience in proper installation of clips so they do not slip while driving 60MPH.
1,Mel Gibson Lets Jesus Have It...Again...And Again...And Again...,"Genre: Religious Exploitation FlickThis is one of the most unrelentingly grueome movies ever made. Mel thinks if he can shock, disgust, and disturb you with hideously graphic depictions of unimaginable brutality and extreme suffering, you'll feel so horrible, you'll accept Jesus as your savior. It's not reason, it's not eloquence. It's exploitation."
4,Very informative & detailed!,"Having become a fan of ""ER"" late in the game (the second season), I was glad to have something to help me know what I had missed. It explained a lot about who everyone was, where they are coming from, and why they are the way they are. I thought it was helpful also to understand some of the medical terminology and know what the abbreviations stand for. I would have liked maybe a bit more information on the backgrounds of the characters, but that doesn't keep very much in the tradition of the show, where we learn about the characters as we go through the seasons, much as you would learn about collegues. Overall, I think it's a great book for someone who came to ""ER"" late in the game and wants some help catching up! It would be great to have additional supplements for the years following the first season!"
2,"full of medical details, but not much else","If you're interested in all the medical details andminutia of every episode, then this book is for you.I was disappointed in the lack of behind-the-scenesstories or cast biographies. If you've taped allthe episodes, there is nothing in this book thatyou don't know."
2,"Too much about the patients, not the doctors","ER is a show about the doctors, not the patients. All this book has is detailed summaries about ""the woman with abdominal pain"", ""the child with the broken arm"", etc. If you like hearing about every single patient that was on ER during the first season, and don't mind reading half a chapter about them, then this book is for you."
3,"They know their stuff, but not presented the best","This book is more about the ""Duh"", and less about the interesting insight as to WHAT is in our food, which is what I was hoping to learn about. I wanted to know the ""inside story of the food industry"" - essentially, what exactly is in the food, how is it processed, what are its effects, etc. etc.If you've seen the movie ""Food, Inc."", that is more of what I wanted. I suppose I should buy the book that goes along with that movie. =)This book was basically a regurgitation of the obvious state of the country...and a long one. Yes - people are fat b/c they eat too much and don't exercise at all anymore. It is heavily focused on obesity in children, which makes sense, because that is where it seems to start these days."
2,Fine product while it worked !!,"Very nice designed mp3 player with many good features for its price. The only problem is that it lasted 3 days !!!The manual reccomended to update the device to the last firmare version available at RCA's website, I performed the procedure and the device went dead with no recovery.I'm waiting RCA to give me a new one..."
2,Unhappy with companies service,"Just a warning. I ordered this item and it arrived promptly at my home. However, the package contained only 16 stays instead of the 28 promised on the package. I called Jos A Bank customer service and spoke with a rep who promised the 12 missing stays would be sent out right away. After waiting 2 weeks I sent an email to Jos A Bank customer service department and have waited 2 weeks and have not received a reply. The stays themselves are fine, but I will never do business with Jos A Bank again."
5,Perfect for making your shirt collars all pointy,"Three lengths! Love them. They make my shirts pointy and straight, much like, well, me. Three different sizes which is perfect since each company seems to make theirs different.only thing is if you only order one item from Jos. A. Bank, I think the shipping is more than the actual item. Oh well."
4,fine product - does the job!,"Size, weight and color was just as advertised. Product was recieved in a timely manner."
1,Never showed up!,This product never showed up...luckily i called and amazon.com refunded my money but i would have liked to try these little guys out....recommend amazon.com but a little wary of jose a bank..hehe
3,"classics, but...","Two of the best movies ever, but you should definitely get the remastered versions with outrageous soundtracks by the Alloy Orchestra."
5,The Only MS Exchange 2003 Book you need,"This book is packed with everything you need to know about Exchange 2003 to attain a very advanced understanding of the product. It includes information on designing the environment, managing, opimizing and troubleshooting (including disaster recovery planning and methods). It has all of the material you need to know to pass exams 070-284 and 285 for MCSA/E: Messaging credential, so you don't need to buy any other books! The CD ROM has the ebook format plus tools and resources that you can use on the job. I have around 60 MS Press books in my library, and this is easilly one of the very best written as well as more useful."
4,IMPORTANT,In this review I will speak about how important the DANCE is as essential to the training of FOCUS. In my career of STAGE AND SCREEN
2,Very little resin,The repair kit only includes 3 oz of resin. I thought that it included at least 8 oz since there was 8 oz of stabilizer. The description did not include the amount of resin and now I understand the reason. It sure fooled me. Unfortunately I bought 4 of these so I will have to go to the hardware store and buy more.
1,shaky,The quart of the Elmers filler was mostly in the box sealing the rest of the products in place. It had apparently been jostled quite a bit.What was left in the container worked very well. I was able to purchase a pint of the filler at Lows to finish the job and it cost more than the quart that was all over the shipping box.
5,Much better than the movie.,Read the book and fill in the blanks or the questions you had after viewing the movie. The book is so much more. Icouldn't put it down.
3,Good for Beginners,"This is a beautiful book--visually pleasing, and probably very good for beginners. The information is presented through examples of problems individuals were having and how they were resolved. This format got to be a bit much after a while--story after story after story with no real narrative about feng shui principles. I was wanting a reference guide, which I sort of thought this might be.If you already have a pretty good grasp of the subject, it's way too basic. But it would be fun for a novice. Her other books are much better and MUCH more useful."
4,Great Detail,This map seems to have great detail for navigating the island of Sicily. I will find out how accurate it is in FEB '06!
3,"looks good, took me a little bit to figure out","took me a little while to figure it out, maybe i was just tired, i dont know..but it took me about a half an hr to figure out what parts i needed"
2,getting near to baby is a better choice,"i liked the idea of reading about a family in distress, as mine was when i found this other book years ago. i also found this one, but the other one, with much of the same subject and even some similar details, was the one I found helpful.Getting Near to Baby (2000 Newbery Honor Book)"
1,??????????,I read almost half way through this book and I could no longer stand it. This book was mostly deatails and no story. Details about what this looked like and what that looked like and what she looked like and he looked like. Get on with the story. What a waste. 100 pages of this book can be summed up in 2-3 sentences.
2,"Memory Jug, it's too descriptive and uninteresting.","I read Memory Jug by Patricia Martin and i gave it two stars. I rated it two stars because the plot was pretty weak. The story dragged and was very uninteresting. The author went into way too much detail on describing small things. She spent about five pages describing the christmas tree in the story and only one on something more interesting like the memory jug itself. The characters were pretty believable because they did things like playing in the snow, going sledding, and they showed sadness."
1,Terrible,Bite me this is my review and my money that I am concerned with. This item was of no practical use at all.
3,no instructions,"I purchased a 3 tier shoe tree and loved it. Decided to buy the 2 tier (from another vendor) and there were no instructions. I figured it out, but probably did something wrong because the top tier is uneven. Can't imagine why they didn't enclose instructions. The product is great for getting your shoes organized in a small space."
5,Introducing techniques of 17 artists,"17 artists shows their tools, methods and works. The author tells, ""The book has been designed to work for you as a workshop and as an inspiration. The goal was to show different approaches taken by many artists, not to give one definitive view."" All the instructions are proofed by the author.The presentation styles are different from artist to artist. Some artists show the detailed process with photos. There are a lot of tips and ideas in this book. I'm interested in the method to apply handmade paper to basket and molding. Even paper making beginner like me can apply some methods. I'll try to put my handmade paper to a basket.Unfortunately most of photos are black and white though includes some color photo section.If you are not satisfied just to make paper, this book is for you."
2,unfeeling,"This story of the author's year as an intern comes across as a monotonous recitation of events with little insight into the author himself. We learn that he learned a lot, likes to criticize nurses, and apparently made no mistakes in his intern year.Strangely, the book comes alive in the 20-page epilogue, in which the author narrates his pre-med school work in the remote areas of Papua New Guinea studying kuru. The author opens up his feelings and experiences with a fascinating story of the contrast between the cultures and medical practices, and kuru itself. If you come across this book, skip the first 222 pages and read the epilogue...."
5,Summarizers,"Book was in great shape, better than advertised. The book also arrived BEFORE the estimated arrival time. Would definitely use this vendor again!"
4,Fun!,This was easy to use. The henna kit had good instructions that kids could follow. And the dye lasted just the right amount of time. We will be buying more of the refill.
1,No Markings,"Perhaps my skin is too dark (a surprise to me), but this henna didn't work at all for me, it didn't even leave any red markings on my fingertips from applying it. If nothing else, I usually end up with something on them. So my search for a potent product continues. Cheers."
4,"""What Me Worry?"" - Worry not, you'll love Mad Season 1 Part 2","Being a BIG fan of Mad magazine, I gravitate towards anything with Alfred E. Neuman's face on the cover and Mad Season 1 Part 2 is no exception. If you're like me then you will enjoy the magazine's various parodies of movies, televison and popular current news events and personalities. If you enjoy Mad Magazine's various articles by the usual gang of idiots, you will find the live action versions of SPY VS. SPY, Sergio Aragones marginals, Don Martin's cartoons and Mort Drucker's great caricatures of popular movie and television stars as they leap off the screen rather than the page in full colour accompanied by music and dialogue which is perfectly matched to the characters and situations they are depicting.Treat yourself to both Mad Season 1 parts 1 and 2. You won't be disappointed!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL MAD FANS!!"
1,boring and untrue,This so-called book is not about Ingrid Bergman. It's about her first husband who must have paid a lot of money to the writer. While I was reading it I had the feeling that Leamer wanted to show how great a person lindstrom was by trying to make us believe that Miss Bergman was a selfish and cold person who didn't care about anything but her career. The 'book' is based mostly on lindstrom's perception of the truth and on the 'writer's' speculation about Miss Bergman's behaviour during her life. It is pathetic. There were parts where I couldn't help laughing out loud because it was sooooooo obvious that what was written was a delusion of the writer. Sometimes Leamer used experts from Miss Bergman's autobiography just to make us believe what he was writing was true.It doesn't deserve any star and I'm really sorry for the trees that were chopped out because of printing this. Complete waste of money and time.
3,nice book for those who like this extrordinary actress,"""As time goes by..."" is an interesting and well-writen book about Ingrid Bergman'life. In fact, it brings the reader some corrections in Bergman's autobiography. My reservation is that the book doesn't go further Bergman's life and most of the information are well-known by some reader that knows at least something of her life."
3,"fun to watch, don't let my rating fool you","If you are watching this for Lucy Lawless, know this: her cameo is less than a minute. HOWEVER, I love this movie. The lead character is cute and loveable. Diehard fans of Hercules and Xena will recognize quite a few folks from both shows, and seeing Micheal Hurst as something other than a sidekick is nice. Also, no one uses any fake north american accents! YAY!Neither the video nor the audio quality is great on this, but I just love the story. If you are totally into XWP or HLJ, then go ahead and splurge. Those who want to see Lucy in something other than a leather warrior outfit might just want to borrow from a friend."
5,Hairy Maclary & Zachary Quack,This is such a nice book! My 3 year old grandson really enjoys the stories written by this author! Pleasurable reading!
5,Such Fun to Read,This book is so much fun to read. It has such a wonderful rhythm and the artwork is gorgeous.
4,sweet book but slinky malinky wins,"Again, another lovely book by Lynley Dodd. My 2 year old enjoys this one but not as much as some others. We also have Slinky Malinky, and she absolutely adores that story. I think the others are more memorable and enjoyable to read. The pictures are nice and story line is cute, but I would try a Slinky Malinky if this is going to be your first Lynley Dodd book."
5,My Favorite Lynley Dodd Book,"I have three little boys, and they all love this book. The rarity of the Lynley Dodd books is that not only will children be mesmerized my the writing and the sweet pictures, but parents love to read them out loud too. It is rare that I truly enjoy reading out loud, but I will read her books over and over. This particular book has to be my favorite, with Harry playfully trying to steal away for a nap and Zachary chasing after him like a little kid. The repetition of the line ""Pittery pattery, skittery, skattery, ZIP round the corner came Zachary Quack!"" is so much fun and it won't be long and your 2 year old will be saying it with you. The illustrations are delightful. Lynley Dodd's books are treasures and I give them away at many a baby shower."
5,Lynley Dodd is GREAT!,"I first learned of this author when we lived in Australia the first year of my daugter's life. I'm so glad I was exposed to her work. I bought 2 books that have 5 books in them for a total of 10 Lynley Dodd works. I love reading them to my kids as they are very fun and rythmic. When they let me pick the books, I always pick a Lynley Dodd book. Zachary Quack is one of their favorites out of the 10 we have so I thought I'd review this one. Adorable book, a gift to the kids and the parents!"
3,Muddled in Places,There was a whole lot of potential here. Spider Man and Ghost Rider vs. The Hobgoblin. This could have been really good. Sadly it comes out all preachy. Ghost Rider seems totally lost and Spider Man spends the whole comic whining and preaching. The fight scenes are tough to follow and there are sections that just don't make sense.
2,Disappointed,"When you spend $300.00 on a product it should be of good quality. The sprayer arrived with missing washers and bolts, broken spray nozzles and it leaks where the hoses are connected to the tank (factory assembled; not by me.) I work hard for my wages as many others do. I should be able to expect quality for my money."
5,jewlery box collection,"My granddaughter absolutely loves these games but the only problem is, it comes with three games but two were the same games, so there was a mistake when it was sent. So, be sure to check to make sure it is right."
4,Scholarly history and a joy to read.,"Knowing little of Venetian history, I picked up this book with no particular expectations. I left it fascinated by Venice's unique place in Mediterranean and European history. Venice's history, like Venice itself, pulls together very different peoples and customs and makes of them something not quite describable in commonplace terms. I read this book anticipating a trip to Venice and am sure it will make all the difference in my appreciation of that city."
4,A superb read,"Often, this book reads like a novel. There are the inevitable slow patches because the history of Venice, with periods of feverish action and decades of lassitude. Nevertheless, Mr. Norwich keeps the action moving along and presents the history of Venice in all its glory and vainglory. While Mr. Norwich clearly loves his subject, he does not permit his feelings to prejudice a fair and evenhanded treatment of the rise and fall of the Venetian Republic. I highly recommend this book to lovers of history and Italy."
4,A Really Good Read,"As a new comer to Venice and its history I fond this book comprehensive and a relatively easy read. There could be more, and more comprehensive, maps."
2,Venice in black and white,"This is a dull read - one doge, pope and sea battle after another. It's missing the life and romance of one of the world's most beautiful and unique places. Very little content about music, art, or the daily life of the averge citizen.I give it thumbs up for covering the span of history from swamp land to Napoleon. But Ruskin's Stones of Venice would be more interesting for the traveler."
1,Neither history nor literature,"Sorry - this simply is not history. There's maybe one fact every 30 pages -- the rest is repetitive thumbnail characterization, wallowing in shallow ""historical forces"" analysis. No historian today would call this anything but story-telling. But it's terrible story-telling -- void of thought, narrative or interesting detail. The opinionated tone is maddening -- who cares if this author thinks a Doge from the 9th century was dull, incompetant, feckless or brilliant? How can you libel someone 1,000 years from your experience? What is the value for the reader? None. I love Venice, and I have patience -- I read manuals for heaven's sake -- but I cannot force my way through any more of this. I stopped at 60 pages, and I wish I'd stopped earlier."
5,Everything it is cracked up to be,"The other reviews are very accurate and I won't repeat them. I want to make only two additional observations. One, this is 99% a political history, a history of war, diplomacy, statecraft, empire and government. There is virtually nothing regarding art, culture, society, economy, daily life etc. The other more pragmatic note for potential buyers is the font of this edition is on the small side which makes for a long read for older eyes."
3,Nice basic kit,"For a serious competition shooter, this might not hold up all that well but for a hobby marksman, it's everything you need but the spare pads. Get a small box and toss it in and you're good for a day at the range."
4,True to the books,"As a long time fan of Terry Pratchett books, I was very please with these two animated versions of the books. Definately worth the buy. If you want an even better Terry Pratchett movie, try Terry Pratchett's Hogfather; it's done with live actors."
3,This is a little flat...,"To start off, I am a big Discworld fan...But these movies left me wanting more. Like others have said, the cover makes it look better than it is. The animation almost looks 2D vs 3D. The animators don't use up to date techniques. ""Soul Music"" is better than ""Wyrd Sisters"", but could also use some updating. I expected more from the cover and from Pratchett. The movie does bring the series to life, which is entertaining in itself.On the other hand, the movie ""The Hogfather"" is not animated and is AWESOME. I hope that any future Discworld movies are either live action or have much better animation than ""Wyrd Sisters & Soul Music""."
3,Okay,I purchased these for the sake of completing my collection of Terry Pratchett inspired movies and while the story is good I think these are too long and the animation too poor to warrant repeated views.
3,Wyrd Sisters/Soul Music dvd's,"This pair of dvd's are quite good, but not as much in the Pratchett style as Colour of Magic and Hogfather, with real people doing the acting! Worth getting to complete collections, perhaps, but not to enjoy as much as, say, Going Postal. The work is good, but at an angle to Pratchett philosophy, in my view."
2,Discworld Collection,"I did not expect that this would be an animated version of the stories. Much, if not most, of the wit and humorous allusive references in the books were absent from the script."
3,Love Terry Pratchett's Stories,"I am just thrilled to see Pratchett's works being turned into movies, animated and live. They are staying very close to the books as they make these, so I don't think that true Pratchett fans will be disappointed in that regard. What won't make them happy is the poor animation and the failure to really capture the personalities as created by Pratchett. I think that actors, even voice actors, should have to read the original material before taking on such well established characters."
4,"Oh, come on! Give a little!","Okay, I know a lot of people are bashing this cartoon, but come on! It's a cartoon! The graphics are fine, but a little old style. I think that might have been done on purpose. Magrat wasn't portrayed exactly, but it was pretty close. A few things need to change when you break down a book into an hour and a half cartoon. Sacrifices must be made and I am completely satisfied with these cartoons. I liked Wyrd Sisters best, but both were great."
4,A guide to drawing by Duane A Wakeham,"The book is a very precice book. there are many chapters covering many of the major subjects of art. My skill have improved a great deal from reviewing this book. The book is a very long piece but its worth the time if you need too, or want to improve your artistic skill in every which way."
5,Great condition- came in a very timely manner,Great condition- came in a very timely manner. Will definitely buy from seller again!
3,Werner is a brilliant musician! but this CD is a bit much!,"80% of CD is wonderful, however, Werner verbalizes on the life-dance-freedom idea of ""Music from the Space,"" the last track and a 12-minute-plus romp through introspection, orchestral notions with amplified strings. The CD looses me here - truly an adventurous spirit is present but too adventurous for my taste."
4,Nice bright red!,"I actually bought this color first at the store, not online. My hair is medium brown, I've been coloring it for many years, so it wasn't ""virgin"". Just before I got Red Hot I had some highlights done and they turned out looking like a rust, which I didn't like. When I colored my hair with Red Hot, it made my highlights vibrant red and the rest of the hair nice dark red. I have no idea how this color would look on black hair, but it is certainly works VERY WELL on medium to dark brown hair (given you use it correctly)."
2,Does not work on black asian hair,"After reading so many positive review on this product i was very dissapointed. I have black asian hair with blonde highlights in it. I use hair developer vol 30 with this product. Results, can only see tint or red under the sun. Maybe vol 40 might work but i have read lots of remarks vol 40 will fry the hair...hrmm.. i might try again since there are several review stating that second time might work!"
3,Not good for dyed hair,"So I had done loads and loads of research on how to get my hair from dark brown to bright red (well, deep red like Ariana Grande) and this product kept popping up everywhere. It had great reviews so I decided to get it, when I realized you can't get it here in Ireland i ordered it. Now I knew a couple of people in reviews were saying that it doesnt really work on dyed brown hair but i thought, why not. My hair is naturally dark brown but i had ombre like a year ago so it has been dyed over with dark brown dye a couple of times. When I used this the first time, I can't lie I was disappointed. It made my hair red, but not vibrant enough. It really will only be bright bright if your hair is virgin hair. Nonetheless, it is a great idea and a good product, you just have to make sure its going to work. I have another box here that probably will not be used."
2,not red!!,"I was so excited to get this color, i put it on and followed the directions perfectly. The color is NOT bright red or a red hot, it turned out more like a weird brick color, it was only slightly red( more of a weird brown-ish red color) I can say that i will never buy this color again, and i really hope the collection isn't like this."
5,Excellent Dance DVD,"This DVD features performances of Flamenco and Middle Eastern dance. Sometimes the dancers dance separately and sometimes to the same music, which gives you a nice idea of how the different dance genres interpret the same music. There are two Flamenco dancers who dance seperately and have a ""skirtfight"". There are three Middle Eastern dancers: Cory Zamora, who put out this DVD, a plus-sized female dancer and a male dancer. The Middle Eastern dancers each have at least two solos and dance together on both an indoor stage and an outdoor stage. There's a cane dance and a sword dance. All the dancers are excellent. I really love this DVD for the variety it shows in dance genres, in dance styles, in settings and in the dancers themselves. I highly recommend it for that purpose."
1,Do not buy this DVD!!!!!,I would rate this as zero stars but Amazon do not give this as an option. There is little or no Flamenco or Bellydance on this very low production value piece. The dancing of either style is very limited with some OK moves in the flamenco and one adequet bellydancer. I know and love both these dance styles and am angry that there are those who put themselves forward as dancers and charge for productions such as this.
5,One of God's most gifted pianist,"Anthony Berger had to be one of the most gifted piano players ever. He could play any type of music. He accompanied the Bill Gaither group for many years up until the time of his untimely death. He passed away at a relatively young age and is greatly miss by all,..all of his music is wonderful and some is very unique..I own almost all of his CDs and DVDs. You could never be disappointed in any of the albums and DVDs, of this very gifted man..Once you try them I think you will come back for more.."
2,Poor WATERY colors ...,I bought these based on some online reviews. I currently use 140lb Arches paper and W & N Artists' Sable Brushes. I found these very water and have poor pigment. I would not recommend it.
4,Great for Women going to Dubai,"Not know much about Dubai when I was first asked to go, I learned a great deal from this book. I learn about different areas, where to go and what the culture was like. Specificly I found the section on ""women traveling to Dubai"" very helpful. It pointed out how to expect to be treated when going out to eat, what to wear, and where to stay.I highly recommand this book and even more so if you're a woman."
4,LP = Awesome,"LP hits another grand slam. I have not bought one LP that wasn't great. I own about 12.Keep up the good work.This one has alot of great information on this amazing city. The maps are a little dated, but what can you expect when youa re mapping the fastest growing city in the world."
3,"Great infuser, but I'm not entirely pleased","The Good: arrived right on time, well made and durable, excellent design, works great, clean-up is easy (just dump and rinse).The Bad and the Ugly: #1 - shipping charges were more than half of the price of the infuser. The infuser is $12 and the shipping (to me - in the same state as the company) was $6.95! Unacceptable. The thing weighs only a few ounces! #2 - MADE IN CHINA - also unacceptable. Not to mention the made in China stickers on each of the two pieces that had to be peeled off and the residue cleaned thoroughly before subjecting the infuser to hot water.Come on Davidsons, you can do better on this product. Look for an American manufacturer will you? If it's not your design or patent, design one yourself and have it made exclusively for you here in the USA. Because as it currently stands, this is most certainly NOT the ""ultimate infuser"", to me anyway..."
2,I wouldn't recommend it.,"Big, a lot of polital mumbo jumo I don't know or care about, I just wanted a book telling of him growing and his wife and kids."
4,Certainly interesting!,"Since there is no book description, here it is!""1817. Off the coast of South Carolina lay Pirate's Bank, a small island as mysterious and intriguing as the legendary family that lived there. For amid the lush greenery and sweet fragrant flowers was an exotic mansion hiding a forbidden past that would forever bind English beauty Rebecca Trenton to two brothers.As the mystery of the island and its inhabitants deepened, she was drawn further into a heart-wrenching secret, and only the searing passion of the man who had captured her very soul could show her the ecstasy of a love that promised forever.""This was my first Patricia Matthews book, and I really enjoyed it. It is definitely different from many of the books I have read. However, I felt that it concentrated too much on the family secrets and not enough on the romance. It was worth a read, but maybe not a second time."
1,Men's watch?,"If you have not seen this product in person, be prepared. This is the size of a traditional woman's watch. I am not sure what Nike considers ""midsize,"" but this does not seem to qualify as such in my book. I immediately sent it back and had to eat the postage for returning it. I had an Oregon that I liked very much and it fit perfectly. I didn't realize that I had what Nike considers the ""super"" size of watches. Moral of the story, pictures don't lie per se, but they don't always show the truth."
2,Cool watch but band breaks,This is a great watch in many ways and draws a lot of attention. But the band attaches to the watch without pins and breaks frequently. I've been through three of these. This is my last one. Time to go to something less sexy and more practical.
1,Buyer beware!!!,"I purchased this item, and it was delivered to me today. I would excercise caution when buying this particular item ... because it is not the same as the item in the picture. It is the new version which features Darth Vader's helmet coming off revealing Anakin Skywalker... it also has a differant stand from ""Return of the Jedi"", and not the base shown in the picture which is from ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Be carefull, and make sure you get what you want when you order... Good luck everyone! ..."
5,This is not Hendrix,"I always laugh at the way people review any release by a Black guitarist. They almost always refer to comparisons with Jimi Hendrix. Please understand this and here are the comparisons...Mr. Ulmer is a guitarist and he is Black. THAT'S IT. There is no - AND I REPEAT - no comparison with Hendrix. Any first time listener will hear this. So don't be sucked into thinking this is Hendrix-like music. It is,however, mind blowing stuff and there is really no way to describe this music except listen and have an open mind and you will play it over and over again. If I had to describe it, it would be Black Martian Funk. That's about it. (And if you want Hendrix comparisons look for Ronnie Drayton, the second guitarist on this album.) Cannot wait until they finally release it on CD."
3,IF YOU NEED 1041 YOU ARE STUCK WITH THIS,"I have used the personal Taxcut for years and love it....I needed to file a 1041 for a family trust beginning last year so I looked into the business version of Turbotax and Taxcut...Turbotax didn't list a 1041, so I had to get Taxcut Home and Business....The 1041 form was buggy and frustrating (save your work often) but I managed to produce the forms and attachments eventually even though inexperienced in trust taxes...a word to the wise: don't wait until the last minute to download upgrades (you get a program ""shell"" in the box and almost everything must be downloaded from H&R Block)...I had to file for extension --not a major hassle since it's automatic and for 6 months with business taxes-- because I couldn't get the upgrades pre-April 15th."
2,this year is harder than ever!,"I have scarcely two weeks to file my corporate business taxes, yet Tax Cut serenely says: NOT APPROVED FOR PRINTING across the top of the form. Ye gods, I can't even print out a sample form to help me file a hand-written form!This cannot be right.I have used Tax Cut (Home & Business) for the past three years because I have both personal, corporate, and trust returns to file, and the Tax Cut version is far less expensive than TurboTax, which peddles separate software for each use.Like others, I find Tax Cut for Business buggy and not intuitive, but I have previously been able to work through it. But this year's experience--not being able to print a return in time for filing--has really soured me on it.The online help is pretty shabby too."
1,Stay Away From This Product Please!,Worst product ever. Difficult to navigate with vague and limited help library. After completing the form had to wait for an update that was predicted to come a month later before I could file???? Like an idiot I waited and no update??!!Took the Turbo Tax route and instant gratification with easy to use support and intruction. Never again Turbo Lax!
5,"This is classic, fantastic, Liv Taylor.","Listen up, this is classic Liv Taylor, at his best, and during his early years. If you are a fan at all you will appreciate this CD. I have this record and have been waiting for this to be reproduced, as with his other older albums. Buy it now, you won't regret it!"
3,AN OK READ,"THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A COLLECTION OF PLAYERS WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT IN THE BIG LEAGUES TO PLAYERS WHO ARE RETIRED. IT COVERS CAREERS OF A COUPLE OF ROOKIES IN 1983 TO KNOWN PLAYERS LIKE BILL WHITE, CATFISH HUNTER AND FERGY JENKINS. THE INTERVIEWS ARE WELL DONE AND IS A NICE EASY READ. A NICE BOOK FOR THE CASUAL FAN."
1,Flimsy,"I ordered 3 pairs of these chairs to match my existing table. I was very excited to assemble them when they arrived. It was fairly easy to put them together, but the hardwares that came with were low quality. You pretty much have to do it right the first time as the hexagon wrench screw turn into round! I was very happy when I got them put together. They looked great with my table, however after using them for 2 weeks, the chairs were wobbly and the screws were loose. I tightened them, no big deal. However, after 3 weeks of using them, while my 8 yr.old son was sitting on it, one of the chair's foot broke at the corner where the screws meet. My son was alright, but the chair was not. It is now in the basement waiting to be trashed.Bottomline not recommended for use with kids. Looks great but not sturdy."
2,picture not exactly what we received,The picture shows that there are supports between the legs on each side. We wanted that as it's nice to use them as a foot rest. Ours did not come with this and it's not that pieces are missing... just a different chair. The fabric wasn't exactly as shown either. Ours came cream colored with dark brown boxes on it. Otherwise chairs look good... contemporary and such. Not much cushion though. Seem to be functioning well so far.
1,don't order from this seller,I ordered this earpiece and it was subpar to say the least. It was horrible quality - there was constant static. It was very frustrating!
1,Vendors are a bunch of rip-off artists,"This book had no French along with the English translation.But their greatest sin of omission was the way they advertised it. 'Opera in 5 acts' - but the book only contained the first three acts!They also charge a ridiculous shipping fee - $10 for a wafer-thin booklet!I think they had a damned hide selling this item on the net in the first place!I'm not going to much around with trying to get a refund, etc, because I would demand the pricks reimburse me for my postage in mailing the thing back (in AU dollars, which is above the US $ at this point!). Not worth the effort!"
1,Remember putting Kool-aid in your hair as a kid? That works better.,"Don't waste your money on this stuff. It's water thin so it makes a huge mess, runs, and permanently dyes everything except hair. I tried this twice and might as well have used strawberry Kool-aid, it was gone after 2 shampoos in platinum bleached hair each time and I let it set covered with heat for more than double the suggested time. Manic panic or Jerome Russel's colors are worlds better for about the same price."
3,"Looks great, Works fair","I have a 1940's double side wash tub. The original's spout mount was infront of the pipe inlets, the new one is inline limiting the spout's swing travel distance because of the pipes.I had to reverse the Left and right valves, to change ""turn on"" to up lever, not down."
3,Good for middle school,"I purchased this product for use with high school biology and physiology classes. I have not been able to use it, however, because the cards are geared more to a middle school level. It would be good for that age group."
5,essential reading,"This book is the most profound, deep work that has ever been done on this book. As practitioners of Chinese medicine we allways read and give attention to the two books of the Huang Ti Nei Ching,the Su Wen and the Ling Shu. The nan Ching is a must for every Chinese Medicine practitioner. This book gives many aspects that made me think again on theories and practical aspects that I use every day as teacher and practitioner.It is pointless to mention the vast knowledge and contribution that Pro. Unsculd bring to the field, saying that it is allways has been great to read his books."
4,Just what we wanted,"We were looking for a backpack for our two-year old daughter and this was just the ticket! It is a great size for a 25+ pound little girl who wants to be like her older brother - and for the price we paid, it is excellent."
1,slow,game is a slow one. I think that it is not worth the cost. shuld be more like 10 dolars. not that much fun. needs more action.
5,Gettysburg,"""This is a rockin' game! I would recommend this game to people who like historical wars."""
5,awesome,this is the best game ever it is very challenging and i wonder why so many people don't like it its such a great game!
4,Light just where you want it.,"I had an artist friend of mine paint the base and the vine which appears to be growing out of the base. It took a lamp that was already extraordinary and made it really stand out. I'm very happy with my purchase.SINcerely,Adrian Alexis"
1,Midway Ripoff,Do not buy this item from Midway because they are ripping you off. Adobe's price for the Mac version 4.0is $80 and the upgrade price is $60. I gave this item a 1 star because of the Midway price. The actualproduct is a 5 star.Check out prices before you buy. C Jones
4,"Very cute set, but even better with Shopping District add-on...","The ""Dinner and a Movie"" set pictured here is also available as part of a much bigger set, and as I type this review, the bigger set ($40 retail value) is on sale for $10. I think the bigger set is being clearanced, so hurry, first come, first served. I got the set I refer to when free shipping was available, but for $10 + shipping, it is still well worth it. Do a search for the following item code- B0009PY6JCHope it is still available when you search."
4,Good CD,"If your a Kitaro fan, you will probably like this one as well.It's not all thatmuch different than a lot of his other ones."
1,Try something else,"A friend of mine let me borrow this book. Real Estate is in the genre of business. Business actually has scientific principles governing it. The only way to make money with business is to pull out more money than you put in. The book does not describe how to go about doing this. It makes some fanciful overtures, but in the end, all it is doing is describing some lucky dice rollers. These people got lucky. Their success is luck and won't apply to you. The rest of the book is advertising. If you want a quick way to make money, affiliate programs are the only means to make it happen. Even most of those are [junk]. Anyone interested in learning real business science can e-mail me. And I won't charge you. ddogslanina at hotmail dot com."
1,GARBAGE,"Mostly the author is trying to sell you his other junk. When he does actually talk about real estate, its just pushing worhtless ""no money down"" techiniques. He thinks you should just get out there and start buying. No mention of numbers and if these purchases will be able to pay for themselves or make you any money. What a joke."
1,Get a different book,"I tend to agree with the other reviewers, the self-promotion is at an embarassing level (although I haven't counted, I would bet that there is some form of promotion of his newsletter or other product on one out of every four pages). Mr. Hicks does hit on important concepts, such as leveraging and no-money down deals, and definitely stresses importance and usefulness, but never gets into the nitty-gritty details of doing it. I felt like the whole book was a ""fleshed-out"" table-of-contents, with the main items, but no meat to how to get it done.There are plenty of good books out there, I would suggest getting one of them instead of this one."
1,Not realistic using his method,"At the end of the book he gives you the plan to make it. It boils down to finding extreme good deal one after another in increasing value and using the equity of the last deal to finance the next one within a month repeatedly. Extreme good deals like those may happen a few times in your life and it is possible but expect to visit over 600 properties in between before finding them and give yourself a couple years in between not one month to prospect. It is possible to do it but it is geting more difficult, requires a lot of knowledge, time and endless amount of work."
3,OK...so it reads like an infomercial at times,"By page 3, upon reading ""if you decide to come visit me at my office, give me a heads up..."" I knew I was in for a laugh. The guy comes off as some kind of naive country bumpkin / used car salesman at times. True. Nevetheless he does lay out some interesting Real Estate financing methods, most of them real long shots though, but hey who's counting...Table of ContentsWorld's Best Borrowed Money BusinessPick your type of Real Estate IncomeMortgages and the Funding you NeedPrivate LendersSelf Starter Real EstateBad Credit / No Credit FinancingNo Money Down FinancingProperty AppreciationThe ""Wrap-around"" Mortgage"
1,A pure waste of paper and ink.,"This book is simply one of those late night infomercials in print version. It's all TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!In order to not put any money down, the author recommends that you try using every single credit card that you own to purchase a building. (If that's what it takes!) Is this guy for real????He also spends too much time talking about his testimonial letters from the people who have tried and succeeded with his methods. Furthermore, he finds every opportunity to mention his get rich quick newsletter with the hopes that you will subscribe.On a serious note, my advice to you is to stay away from this book! These ideas are way out of this world, and simply DANGEROUS!On the lighter side, read it, and die laughing!"
1,The Worst ... in Publications!!,"Very Vague! Hicks refers to other books and publications for the reader to buy. Why book another book when we bought this book seeking answers? There is no way to get a house with zero out of pocket cost. I am a Loan Officer and I handle loans all the time. Even 103% financing requires the buyer to pay for an inspection report and appraisal. In the state of California, $500 to $1000 deposit is required just to open escrow. This book is a bunch of bull."
1,And monkeys might fly out of my...,"This is hands down the most useless book I have ever purchased. My discernment must be waning with age. To illustrate, let me quote the book so it can condemn itself. This is great material, truly laughable:""Everyone who has ever built a a million-dollar fortune in real estate says that the results are worth all the effort and problems!""Wow. Need I say more? The entire book is peppered with similiar profound insight. I wonder how the people who unsuccessfully tried to build a million-dollar fortune but ended up declaring bankruptcy felt? Hm?The sheer volume of exclamation points and bullets should have been a huge waving red flag. The enthusiasm is numbing. And how can one feel justified in creating so many of his own acronyms? Who is this guy anyway? It's written like a [junky] motivational infomercial.Alright, I am done venting. More than anything I am annoyed at myself for my lack of discretion in buying this bonified piece of [junk]."
1,i agree--there needss to be a zero star option,"If you want all the ""information"" in this book pick up Real Estate Riches by Dolf De Roos. It contains everything useful in this book and only enough hype to get you excited. This book on the other hand is a thinly disguised info-mercial for a lot of other drivel that Hicks will make a profit if you purchase.Please by something from a useful guru (ie. Peter Conti and David Finkel, Dolf de Roos, Russ Whitney) and save yourself the dissapointment."
1,please don't waste your time or money,"I read this book from cover to cover and was highly disappointed. His principles are based on non-professional opinions, and simplified beliefs of the future. ""Find a property, buy it for $0 down, rent it, repeat"" was the entire premise of the book. I felt that this book was a 257 page advertisement for Mr. Hicks other services, which, unfortunately, are the only action steps given in this book. This book was so disappointing that I can not justify the purchase of it an will be returning this book. There are other books that are more worthy of your hard earned dollar. Sorry for such a negative review, but this was truly a worthless book."
1,Not worth it!,The book is basically one big ad. The primary thing the author talks about is subscribing to his journal and buying is other books. The few points that his does make are simply repeated over and over. The entire content of the book could have been contained on 10 pages.
1,This book is one big ad to buy his other material,"I bought this book after scanning it at my local bookstore. Now that I've actually sat down to read it I can say that this book is useless, vague, and a waste of paper.Approximately seventy-five percent of the book is either a testimonial of someone stating that a particular money method worked for them or an attempt to get the reader to subscribe to the author's newsletter or his other books."
1,"I could not rate this 0 stars, so I chose one star.","This book is really THAT bad. I finished reading the book and I know very little more than when I started! This is literally an infomercial in a book. The instructions are so vague it is not funny and the author constantly refers you to his previous book for more details! What I learned in his book was: 1. Buy his newsletter for $24 a year. 2. If you want to be succesful, buy his two books for $90 each. 3. If you want actual details, buy his previous book. You may think I'm making mountains out of ant hills, but trust me. Read the first two chapters in the book store and you will see. Even his valued letters, sent from several of his faitful readers, were thanking him for his previous book and not this one! Do yourself a favor. Stay away from this book and look for one with actual steps. This one is so vague that I learned much more in two hours of reading Internet forums than I did reading this book. I hope you will not waste your money."
1,I am now dumber for having read this!!!,"I am shocked that a friend of mine recommended this book. I just read the first 50 pages and I am honestly considering burning this waste of paper. This book would insult the intelligence of my cat. I only wish I had taken the time to read some of the other reviews prior to buying this ""book"". Be advised!"
1,I paid for Mr. Hicks advertising of his other books!,"If you are an experienced real estate investor, this book will give you some good insights and thoughts. But if you are a beginner trying to buy a real estate, DO NOT waste money on this book even the book does not cost that much. I'm sure there are plenty other books you can find. From the front cover to back, Mr. Hicks repeats over and over ""how to make Millions in real estate with no cash,"" but does not exactly show how to go about doing it. He gave very good details on how to buy his other books and magazines though. I am very diappointed with this book."
2,"""Where's the Meat?""","I am happy that I didn't buy this book and borrowed it from the library instead. I wanted to read this book with an open mind and get past the self promotion and really learn something about investing in real estate. But my open mind was shut with Hicks' self promotion over and over again. He encourages all to subscribe to his newsletters and buy his other programs.There were a few questions I had before I read the book: one was where to find property that would provide me with a positive cash flow. I never got that answer. I also wanted to know about where to look for government programs that give grants for rehabilitation. I never got the answer, but I'm sure that if I subscribe to the newsletter and buy all of his kits, I may learn something, but unfortunately I want to spend my time and money investing in real estate not books."
1,Little information ---too much hype,This book by Hicks is nothing more than quick and glib sayings and pie in the sky real estate dreams. Save your money. (...) This book is a waste of spare time.
1,Where's the info??,"After reading this book you never find out how to get 100%+ financing. They get close with vague information and then reccommend more books. About every 5 pages you are asked to subscribe to Ty Hick's Newletter or a $... book.Ty Hicks might know how to make millions in real estate, but he never tells you in this book.I reccommend REAL ESTATE RICHES by Dolf De Roos put out by Rich Dad.com books instead. Dolf actually gives you info and you can read the book in 2 days easily."
1,Complete Waste of Time,One should know that buying books with such a title is usually a disappointment. Much the same as that prymind program attended when one was younger and more guliable.From start to finish this book was used to advertise the authors other products while providing only the most broad and common sense views available on investing. Fuffy and non substantive.I would not buy from this authors other titles. To be completely honest a book with such a title I am embarassed to place on my shelf. I guess this one finds the inside of my trash can.Who could believe that WSJ actually can place it on it best selling list.
2,Shameless Self - Promotion,"Title says it all... end of story! Shameless Self Promotion - this guy uses this book as a billboard to promote his other courses and newsletters. Although any information is better then no information, this book is better serving me as a doorstop I turned it into after reading it. I will say that the methods that he makes mention to ARE valid - it's just that you will have to go elsewhere to learn how to actually IMPLEMENT them, as he never really ""gets to the point"" In short - this how to book never shows it's readers ""how to"""
2,Front cover and blurbs set you up,"I bought the book and got really excited that this was going to actually show you how to go about accomplishing this. The book does give some valuable information to get your mind thinking.But it seems that the author is more interested in getting you to order his courses than actually writing what was advertised.""the old bait and switch routine."" But it sure does give the creative real estate investor some points to ponder."
2,NOT good for true beginners,"Ultimately, I think if you already have a decent understanding of basic yoga, this video would be a good work out... I hope to work up to it. But if you have really never done yoga before and do not know much about it, this video is too fast and does not spend time on basic poses and correct form. I need something slower, that spends time on getting the poses right. Eventually, I think this would be a good every day routine..."
5,Yoga DVD,I am very happy with this yoga DVD. I am doing the lunar part and am able to perform all of the postures. Desiree's voice is very soothing and gives excellent cues so that sometimes I can do the postures with my eyes closed even though I just started doing it. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!
3,Good Pace for Me,"This is a good paced workout, probably a little fast for beginners though. The only problem I had with this workout is that Desi does not do the exact same poses for each leg. During the first series of standing poses, she says ""lets do this on the other leg but it was a completely different routine. The rest of the workout flows smoothly after that. Seems that they should have caught that during editing."
2,Toast well; But,"I loved the style, functions and even toasting of this model! Too bad the slice rest are a little flimsy; made of cheap metal. After three days, one bent, using the high-lift feature. Which caused it to get stuck down and not raise anymore; If Oster would use a different type or grade metal; it would be A Great Toaster! Needless to say I had to return it to Wal-Mart yesterday, and I searched for a different make with sturdier rest. Respectfully Submitted, John W. Adam"
2,"It toasts. Otherwise, not impressed.","This toaster is made cheaply. It takes two or three times to get the lever to stay pushed down so that it will toast. It seems like one level burns a bit while the next notch down makes it not quite toasted enough. It feels very cheap, like I'm about to break the lever each time I use it. However, there is one good feature: it allows you to pull up on the lever to raise the toast up high enough that you can pull it out without burning yourself."
3,The comment track is the only thing that makes it watchable,"Man, this is one ripe turkey, complete with a voiceover by Mother Nature. A freaky temple, vague geography, incredibly bad acting and a plot that is given away by the artwork of the opening credits all contribute to this train wreck. The Film Crew does a good job with this one but I still like Hollywood After Dark better.Once again, if you loved MST3K you'll get a kick out of this show as well."
4,This one mildly hurt,"The Crew is back in classic form with this one, and I really enjoyed the lunch time sketch with my being a geographer. The movie is pathetic, and colorized! At least it looks colorized. I won't rate this outing as ""severe hurt"" because the Wild Women of Wongo just didn't have much going for it since it dispensed with acting and plot, and most of the memorable moments comes from the Crew.Still, a great way to kill off a couple of hours, and I'll definitely watch it again."
5,DANCE!!!DANCE!!!!DANCE!!!!,"SO far my favorite by The Film Crew. This is the perfect film that was just bad enough to be watchable with the crew's humor. The guys from MST3K bring you their next project The Wild Women of Wongo where mother nature has separated the beautiful women on one island to be with brute and and the pretty men with the ""non"" beautiful women. One of the women reminds us of Chris Farley. The skits are a little dry as usual but most of us get it for the commentary anyway. The group also has Rifftrax. Downloadable commentaries for mainstream movies if you like the idea but find it too difficult to sit through. The DVD is exactly what it is, a bad movie with funny commentary to make it watchable. And remember Dance....Dance.....Dance. You will have to see to understand.... then again I still don't understand, and I am OK with that."
2,Headphone Output is Terrible,"Returning it as the headphone output is very bad, otherwise very nice model. Sad I can't use it."
3,returned,"bought as gift but didn't give it, returned instead, sorry I can't give a review, seemed like a good deal."
5,A Good Scanner,"This is a cool looking scanner,plus it scans police,fire,and taxi cabs exc. very well.It has good sensitivity plus an AM FM radio and alarm clock. With the quality andall the features this is well worth the scanning fun money."
2,no good to us now since codes are scrambled,"when I purchased the radio, I was unaware that the codes were to be scrambled Jan 31st, 2013, so now I paid that kind of money for a clock radio"
3,Receives well,"When I finally managed to get the receiver on the desired frequency and put on hold, if does receive well. Either my unit does not work properly or the instructions are completetly inaccurate as regards to how the device works and programs. I suspect the latter. The programming seems unduely complex and I never was able to accomplish any desired frequency storage. Using the supplied manual it simply would not enter the frequencies when the provided instructions were used."
4,gave this as a gift,"I was told that of all the scanners my father has owned this is the best in features and reception he's owned. It picks up bands the others never did.Even though I gave it to him early as a christmas present,I couldn't take any more about his Radio Shack being a pile of junk. Now we'll all have a Merry Christmas. You all have one too!!"
3,Programming,This item is difficult to program. Need all kinda reference books to program. Radio reception with loop is poor in our country. FM reception is poor
2,Uhiden Bearcat Scanner,I think this would be a good scanner if I could figure out how to set the police and fire channels. I once accidently found a local police station I could listen to--But then accidently lost it. The clockradio and weather channel on this unit are good. But I kinda wish I had sent it back in the 30 day timeframe. I have a 4 year college degree. I thought surely I could figure out how to use the scanner. But there are very few instructions on this in the booklet. And I'm not psychic.....so....I'm stuck....with something I can't use.[ASIN:B000EVWC9C Uniden 300-Channel Clock Radio Scanner]]
4,Scanner,"i think this is a nice product, i have little exp. with scanners so it was a little difficult for me to figure out."
5,Wake up America!!,"The Ballad of Carl Drega is one of several important books which every library should have. Along with other eye opening titles such as Molon Labe! and Unintended Consequences, these are must reads for those who have an inkling something is rotten in the state of America. Despite it being a series of essays, it flows quite well and never lets up with telling the truth of the danger we find America in. It is worth every penny, though if you cannot afford check out your library."
1,Lamp went out on 4th day of ownership; terrible warranty,"On the fourth day of owning this TV, the lamp went out completely!! After talking to consumer relations, we found out that even though they will send you a replacement lamp, you (the customer) is responsible for replacing the lamp; they do not send out their service people to do it even while under warranty. Furthermore, after calling in to open a case, they give you a confirmation number and you have to write this number on your receipt (proof of purchase) and fax it to them before they will send the part out. What a HASSLE, not to mention the poor quality of the TV's lamp to go out on the FOURTH day of ownership."
5,"Mitsubishi WD-73732 73"" 1080p DLP HDTV","Excellent TV with an abundance of input and output jacks. Excellent picture quality even better than my plasma set. Compact in size from earlier models (200 LBS vs 400 LBS for previous 65"" model). The only thing that this set did not come with that my previous Mitsubishi set had was a PIP audio output. Really miss that feature but otherwise extremely satisfied with set."
5,Great TV,"Had this TV for about 30 days now and remain impressed with the quality. One word of warning... I had a credenza I planned on using that had close dimensions to the matching stand that is $449.00. After recieving the TV it was clear you really do need the matching stand to fit the TV properly. I ordered it locally from a Mitsubishi dealer for $295.00. Also when I bought this TV it was $2799.00... it has gone up and down from $2799.00 to $3499.00 over the past month. I have no idea why it keeps going up and down. Again, the picture is great and setup is very easy. I have it hooked to HD Cable and a PS3 ... the Blu Ray PS3 movie screen play is stunning. I dont think you can go wrong with this TV."
4,Nice big screen but there's a lamp problem,"The big screen is rewarding and enjoyable to watch and gets as good a picture as the Plasmas however, the lamp went out after 2 years of use and when I ordered another one off the internet, that only last about a month. I just hope this isn't a continuous problem. Purchased January 2007."
4,"Pleased with product, Be careful to order correct side.",It wasn't much fun to install. I ordered the wrong side the 1st time. instead of returning I decided to replace both sides. Order was shipped promptly and worked great.
5,Good for the soul!,"Watching The Ride was time well spent! An honest, funny and adventurous journey that is more about human compassion and inspiration than bicycles. Good for the soul!"
1,"Annoying, loud, and lacking soul","Right from the get-go, the Peewee Herman and Roger Rabbit music bothered me. I watched 10 or so minutes and the music stayed awful. As another reviewer put it, this documentary lacks soul. I wish it was a bit quieter and not just fun and games an annoying soundtrack more fit for a fun feature film than a cycling documentary. I couldn't finish it."
5,Riding for a cause,"I was fortunate enough to share in a tiny part of the ride with Phil Keoghan in Iowa, and had followed all of the daily video blogs online during his 40 day, 3500 mile bike ride from Los Angeles to New York. Seeing this amazing documentary (filmed in HD) still exceeded my expectations in every way. I'm living with MS, and my sister is as well, so my motivation to meet and ride with Phil was based on the inspiration I received from his incredible adventure on behalf of the ""cause"" that I live with daily.I love that the story covers far more than a bike ride. It's about dreams, relationships, friendships and growth, and it's told with a perfect mixture of adventure, humor and real-life serious challenges.Phil's personal philosophy is ""No Opportunity Wasted,"" and ""The Ride"" is a documentary movie that should be on your must see NOW list!"
2,So they made it.,"If you are looking for a documentary about people exploring the US by bicycle, this is not for you.If you are looking for a documentary about how a somewhat famous person gets sponsored bikes, police escorts, and a support crew, then crosses the US to attend fundraisers for Multiple Sclerosis: this is for you. I'm amazed at how they managed to keep such great time so consistently. Talk about hard work for a great cause!It will not inspire you to go on a long adventure by bicycle, but it may entertain your wife on a Friday night."
5,Great documentary! Must see!,"The Ride was inspirational, hilarious and engaging. It has built-in suspense and adventure, while also being funny throughout. You feel like you've known Phil your whole life after watching him ride through his journey and hearing his commentary about his experience and his relationship with his father. It's extremely personal, yet I feel it will reach a very wide audience. You can't watch The Ride and not want to do something physical afterward, especially for charity. And I agree with the other user's review--the camera work was fantastic! I highly highly recommend The Ride!"
5,"Positive, Inspirational and Motivating Movie!","I had the opportunity to see this movie twice. I first rented the movie from AMAZON thinking I would not have the chance to see the movie in the theatres, and then luckily experienced it LIVE with Phil Keoghan commentating on the documentary in Philadelphia. I was very moved by the film and Phil's endurance on his trip. The amount of people who participated nationally for the MS cause was incredible and heartwarming. Most of all, and MOST importantly, this movie is very positive (Unlike most these days). It shows human spirit and love for one another. I would highly recommend this film for everyone. If I could I have, I would have brought my kids to the theatre showing, but it was an 8 hr trek. We drove from Syracuse to see it to Philly and back in a night. Thank you Phil for an excellent ride we will not forget!"
2,Lucky Lanes...not so lucky!,"Bought and sent to my grandchildren. One of the pins sprung a leak shortly after they received it. It cute, but not worth the money."
1,Wow surprising bad..,"From what I read of other viewers this American version was cut and was supposed to be much better than this. But wow!! I have not given a 1 star for a film in a long time. The film does not have any continuity and makes absolutely no sense at all. It now makes all the more sense when the others who have watched the uncut versions, to see how butchered this film is because it makes absolutely no sense at all. THe only good thing I could say about this is it does have some humor in it that will totally make u laugh but its not enough to make up for the ... of film this is. If I could go back to the past in a time machine, I would tell myself this was a mistake.Good points: some humor that is uniqueBad points: choppy story, bad plot, boring film, no actionOveral grade : F-"
1,SO BAD IT HURT TO WATCH,"I rented this movie tonight and just finsihed watching it. I thought I would write a reveiw to save someone from buying this awful movie. Thank god I only rented it. Until tonight I thought no move could be as bad as ""The Jersey Devil"" (another movie to stay away from) but this movie proved me wrong. I watched the whole thing from beginning to end and I couldn't tell you what it was about to save my life. It skips from scene to scene and never explains ANYTHING. I don't know what idiot let this movie be released but he should be hunted down and tortured! Whatever you do, don't rent, buy or watch this movie. It will only make you angry that you can't get back the time you wasted on watching it."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE,"Please do yourself a favour and do not spend money in a movie so edited and cut that it's impossible to understand it. I bought the movie because I believed it had something to do with vampires (if you see the cover you'll understand), however it is far from it. Anyway, I cheched the ""Making - of"" documentary and found all the escenes that I didn't see in the movie. I believe they cut almost 15 minutes of the film. It might be a good movie, but not in this condition. It should have never been released like this. REAL PITTY."
3,Despite the Bad Reviews...,"Ok, so it wasn't the movie of the year. It doesn't however necessarily deserve all the bad reviews. Perhaps, the plot could have been slightly more developed, rather than handing us snipets of the stories motive. The reason that I say this is that if it were simply a slasher style film with little plot that would have been sufficient, but the storyline for this film required that the viewer have more knowledge of what the events leading up to and occuring in the film concerned. High points of the film included the following: decent acting, and subtle dark humor, as well as a few moderately entertaing action sequences. Of course, the highest point of the film...actress Kimberly Liebe. Her acting was comparable with the acting of the other cast members, but her beauty was the most memorable! I give this film 3 stars."
1,Legion of the dead,"How can I put this? ""IT STINKS"". It seems they spent the majority of the budget on the cover then on the actual film. The movie makes no sense what so ever. It jumps from scene to scene without continuity. What was this guy thinking This is not even worth renting. Save your money folks, this one is not even boring enough to be called a sleeper."
1,"Horrible, Terrible, Horrible... Atrociously Horrible","Why is there no ZERO stars rating option? Because this movie needs it. This movie is absolutely terrible. I can't even begin to explain how rediculously and absurdly bad-bad-bad this movie is. Wow. Bad. No plot, no reasoning, just a cavalcade of bad actors attempting to act like something other than bad actors in bizarre, randomly spliced-together scenes leading nowhere.Plot: nonexistant.Setting: unknown.Characters: dull.Conflict: undefined.Story setup: none.Action: bumbling.Horror: weak attempts.I rented this movie because it looked awesome, and the title reminded me of one of my favorite Testament songs (""Legions of the Dead""). When I returned it I asked for my money back."
1,Worst waste of my time DVD,"I have never seen a more stupid excuse for a movie in my life. Not one person can act, all the effects are really bad, and the plot is even more stupid. None of the scenes match up with each other. The Legion is never really explained, and neither is most of the movie. This movie was the most retarded thing I have ever wasted [$$$] and 2 hours on."
1,So much to say... but a 1000 words?!,"I'm very glad I got to see this movie for free. If what the previous reviewer says says about the unedited version of the film is true, then a lot of people will be led astray watching this film, thinking they've rented From Dusk 'til Dawn or Evil Dead. Get the unedited version if you can. I'll be looking for it as well."
1,Ugh,"Yes, UGH! This movie is not worth the effort of thinking of a proper title for my review.Inane, headache-inducing horror aspires to be another FROM DUSK TILL DAWN but fails miserably. The plot revolves around a pair of Satan's minions who are roaming the desert searching for souls to add to Hell's army. Though LEGION OF THE DEAD has numerous scenes sure to please gore hounds; the movie chokes on its very ineptitude. Kimberly Liebe's beauty is the film's only asset- but her performance is one of too many liabilities. A horror in every sense of the word and a picture to be avoided at all costs."
1,From Dusk'till dawn RIP OFF !,"Very bad acting,bad SFX, bad lighting, no plot, no story except the one they stole to From dusk'till dawn. One star for the retarded guy who made me laugh. This is CRAP ! To avoid or forget."
3,COULD BE BETTER,"Whilst this dvd is quite enjoyable, full of great artists and vocal treats, why is it limited by the quality of soundtracks. Music and Dvd companies are milking our hard earned dollars and giving us second rate sound tracks, are you listening SONY If Blu-ray is so... great with HD picture and true HD sound,where is it, whoops! no HD sound, no DTS sound, we get second rate sound, i am now refusing to buy anything that does not have either true HD sound or a DTS soundtrack in Blu ray. Wake up and stop ripping us off."
4,Worth buying,Chris Botti live blue-ray video has an excellent picture and very clear sound. If you like Chris Botti or smooth jazz this video is certainly worth buying. The blue-ray quality is just like being there.
5,What a concert!,"I'm sorry to say I was not familiar with Chris Botti when I first watched this DVD in Oct. 07, but I am an avid fan now. What a show he puts on. This DVD is so entertaining, he is just wonderful and his guests are out of this world. If you like Sting, Burt Bacharach, Gladys Knight or Paula Cole, you will love this concert. Chris Botti has me hooked and I now want to see him live. Buy this DVD and have a party to watch it. Enjoy!"
5,Chtis Botti Live w/Friends,"As I am an avid fan of Chris Botti, this CD and DVD Bonus Pack is the ""BOMB"""
5,Smooth jz1,Great disc the talent on this disc is just fantastic.Not one average performance Chris has established himself among the giants.
1,Botti tape,We were disappointed..Not because of the content (we had heard it in a bistro and had to have it) but we thought we were getting a CD. We tried every means of getting it to play to no avail. There was no indication on the packaging that it wasn't a CD. Can you enlighten me? Time for returning had expired..
1,BLUE-RAY Technology,The one star is because I apparently do not have a Blue-Ray DVD Player. I selected the Blu-Star version of the DVD because it had more content. The description of the DVD did not indicate that you had to have a Blu-Ray DVD. I have seen the Cable version of this show and I rate it at 5 STARS.Pecos
5,Masterpiece,This DVD is a pure treasure and work of art. Chris Botti has assembled a cast of artist that has made nothing less than a masterpiece. I highly recommend this DVD to all jazz lovers.
3,"Pretty good, missing one important song","This is a great cd- the performance, the audio quality, just about everything.I was very disappointed though that he did not include his most popular song Indian Summer. This song is what even got me hooked on Botti's music in the first place.This would be a 5 star for me, except for the very notable omission. If that song doesn't do much for you, then you will really enjoy it."
1,Didn't know it was Blu-ray,"I guess it was my fault when ordering but I didn't know it was Blu-ray so I didn't play on my DVD unit hence the rating which I'm sure is way off base. I expected it to be at least a four star from me. I have the CD and have played it over and over again. Just wish it hadn't arrived as a Blu-ray. I really don't hate it as a DVD, just didn't have any other choice to write the review. If you have a Blu-ray, get it. I already know the music is great."
5,Get it,"If you are a fan on Chris Botti or if you just enjoy Jazz, the quality of his music and trumpet playing is excellent. His guests as usual are spectacular. This is Jazz all throughout, beautifully performed, If however you want a slightly more varied musical experience as a first exposure to Botti, get his performance in Boston."
5,Great DVD,If you haven't seen this you are missing out on the greatest music on DVD. It's one of my favorites of all time.
1,Buyer beware - Blu-ray version is NOT hi-def,"This is a great performance by Botti, but the Blu-ray version is NOT hi-def video. It is clearly 480i upsampled to 1080i, and mastered poorly at that.I own both the DVD/CD combo pack and Blu-ray versions. Using an Oppo BDP-83SE and Pioneer 101FD, the DVD version upsamples much cleaner to 1080p. The Blu-ray version is soft and has many artifacts (halos, lacks detail, ringing, etc...). The audio is 96/24, but sounds no better than the DVD version. The packaging says ""High Definition video and audio"" but no mention of ""1080"".Branko Vekic was mistaken in his review, this is not the Botti reference Blu-ray. Botti in Boston is the reference version and really shows what Blu-ray can do. It is 1080i/24fps with Dolby TrueHD....a must have to show off your system.If you'd like to purchase this performance, your best bet is to get the DVD/CD combo version on sale."
4,Chris Botti Live (Not In Boston like I thought),"I thought I was buying the ""Chris Botti -Live in Boston"" DVD/CD combo, so I love Chris Botti, but was disappointed in the wrong selection. Your service was excellent, though. I'm now still waiting for an 'overdue' reorder of the correct title...bought from another vendor, ""I think."" Thanks"

2,A lot less inspiring than you'd think from all the reviews,"I don't have much to say other than I bought based on Home Theater magazine recommendation. Pretty dull concert. Too much formulaic Botti blowing long, sensitive notes, much like some concerts nod you out when everyone has their obligatory solo. Well, Botti gets an obligatory blow every song. A couple of the songs wake you up, but it's a lot of protocol and not enough emotion. At least for me. All that talent for guests and you never had a sense they jelled and jammed."
5,BEST I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME!!!!,"I HEARD THIS DVD PLAYING IN A BEST BUY MEDIA ROOM. AFTER HEARING IT, I IMMEDIATELY WENT AND PURCHASED IT. THE LINE UP WAS INCREDIBLE!!! JILL SCOTT, PAULA COLE, GLADIS KNIGHT AND STING!! WHAT ELSE COULD YOU WANT!! THIS IS TRULY GREAT, GREAT, FEEL GOOD MUSIC. ONE OF MY FAV'S IS, ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!"" IT'S PREFORMED BY STING AND IS ABSOULTELY AMAZING!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR!!! GRAB YOUR WALLET AND YOUR WIFE!! GO BUY THIS DVD NOW!! THE BOTH OF YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!!!"
3,easy reading,"I've used this as a textbook for a college level history class, and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. Schwantes' writing flows, and reads more like a story rather than a textbook. I could and probably would read this book on my own time as a source of entertainment. He does not dig very deep into the subject, but as stated above, he simply gives a brief oversite of the history of the region. If you have a casual interest in the PNW, buy this book. You may find it cheaper in a book store though. I paid less in a college bookstore!!!"
4,Must Reading,"In my opinion, this is the basic book for those interesed in psychodrama. It contains the fundamentals and is worth reading for both beginning students and seasoned therapists."
3,FIRST MISTAKE LAST MISTAKE NEXT MISTAKE...NO MORE MISTAKES!,Carla Harris a beautiful but not so successful actress from L.A. Witnesses her husband killed. She travels to her parents home in the mountains ALONE(BIG MISTAKE!) Their she is harassed and raped by a bunch of locals(BIGGER MISTAKE!!)

1,Bargain basement film making with no redeeming qualities,"""In the angry tradition of DEATH WISH and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE"" comes this piece of inept garbage. Think I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE without the creative cinematography and with DALLAS star Deborah Tranelli in Camille Keaton's place. Visualise the dumbest redneck scumbags that make Eron Tabor and Richard Pace look like suave Bond-style megalomaniacs by comparison. Eliminate everything that made I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE disturbing, shocking and taboo breaking and you have NAKED VENGEANCE.After being gang raped by backwoods hicks, Tranelli predictably seeks revenge, though she is fully clothed when she does so, despite the title.Personally I love revenge movies, but this one really scrapes the bottom of the barrell. Check out MS .45 or STRAW DOGS instead."
1,NAKED VENGEANCE (VHS),"THE WORST CONDITION VHS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. TRIED ON THREE VHS PLAYERS, NO LUCK. PICTURE JUMPS, ROLLS, DISTORTS, ETC. SOUND CONTINOUSLY GOES HIGH THEN LOW, AND DISTORTED.UNABLE TO TOLERATE DISORTIONS. THREW IN TRASH. NEVER BUY FROM THIS VENDOR. UNABLE TO CONTACT VENDOR."
1,Garbage,This radio is not worth the money. The weather band does not pick up signals and the alert does not work. This is a dangerous radio if you are relying on it for alerts. I have returned 2 of these and still had the same problem. The people at GPX did not seam to care about the problem.
1,this radio is crap,dont waste your time...I live in georgia and frankly have tornado sirens go off a few times a year...radio never works...nada...silence. Dont bother spend a few dollars more and get something worth it.PB
3,Incomplete?,"Since I don't get the paper edition anymore, I've been wondering how complete the Kindle edition is. I didn't really expect graphics, since most other Kindle periodicals don't have them or leave most of them out, but I was shocked when the latest issue of Atlantic in the Kindle edition had a list of the contents of the Election Special, but not the Special itself. Bummer."
3,"Great Magazine, but incomplete","As much as I like the Atlantic, the Kindle version pales in comparison to the physical magazine. There is no reason photos, graphs and other visual elements should be left out.I also dislike the index, which is just a listing of sections. I would much rather have a link to each individual article and a description of what the article is about. Nowhere is there a brief description of the contents of each article and the titles aren't always descriptive. Clever maybe, but not descriptive. So, I end up reading a paragraph or two before I decide whether or not it's something that I'm interested in reading. Occasionally this means I expose myself to something I might have skipped over, but I would still prefer to have some better cues.The cost is low for the Kindle edition, but I would rather pay extra for the full experience."
4,I love the Atlantic in any format,Yep I miss the color pictures but it's still the Atlantic and with the Kindle version I tend to read every article.
1,Atlantic Mag.. Ben Bernanke Mouthpiece,"Wow... Thanks Atlantic Magazine for making up my mind NOT to subscribe to your publication. Obviously Atlantic magazine is the new official mouthpiece for Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve.Tore up the check I was about to send you ... No problem making it out to Rolling Stone Magazine instead.What a contrast between your recent cover puff-piece on helicopter Ben, and the national hero Matt Taibbi has become at Rolling Stone. ( re his new article on Bank Of America).Can't wait to see your next issue... wonder what financial criminal will grace that cover?Thanks, mt keller"
4,Great for a basic kindle,"Unlike the New Yorker which can't be used with a basic Kindle, the format of the Atlantic lends itself nicely to a Kindle display. As for the actual content of the magazine, it's a great read overall."
2,Inconsistent delivery,"I enjoy reading the Atlantic when I receive it, but as other reviewers have mentioned, there seems to be a problem with receiving new issues. The claim on the subscription page is that it will be delivered as soon as physical copy hits newstand -- don't count on it."
4,"The focus is the text which is all there, but...","The Atlantic has many strengths as a news magazine. They translate to the Kindle adequately. But one thing about the magazine should be known before subscribing, and it's rather misleading of Amazon to leave this out of the description: The Atlantic is not, strictly speaking, a monthly magazine. Sometimes they have dual-month issues. So, you aren't getting a full 12 issues a year. This may explain why the subscription price is significantly lower, per month, than the single-issue price."
2,Kindle Edition leaves much to be desired,"The content of The Atlantic Magazine is quite good. I tried out the trial subscription for the Kindle fire. I read ""The Ally From Hell"", about Pakistan, in the Dec. 2011 issue. It was a pretty well balanced and thorough look at that country's relationship with the U.S.My big problem with with the format and navigational problems with the Kindle edition.A stroll bar at the bottom of the screen allows you to find articles articles fairly easily.The pages are formatted to fit the Kindle screen. You have to resize it in order to read without straining your eyes.Unfortunately, using the touch screen to move from column to column is difficult. If you swipe left of right too quickly, you end up on the next page (which returns to the smaller page size). All in all, it's a fustrating way to read an article. You would be better served by subscribing to the newstand version."
1,"Great Magazine, But No Delivery","The magazine is great, nicely formatted. But after I received the first one, did not receive the second at all. After 2 weeks, cancelled and got a refund."
2,Paying 12 months for 10 issues,"I like the magazine, and was satisfied with the version you get here - but I'm not happy that it says ""Delivered Monthly"", and you pay 12 times during the year, but you only get 10 issues - which apparently is all this MONTHLY magazine publishes. But I could not find anything on this page that says that. I could not find anything on the Atlantic web site that says WHEN they publish. So - if you think of it as $23.88 for 10 issues, paid in 12 monthly installments, then you should be happy. I wasn't."
3,formatting lets it down,"Given the impracticalities of getting a print edition of ""The Atlantic"" to Dar es Salaam, I really appreciate getting a reasonably priced edition delivered to my kindle. However, the formatting of this edition is disappointing, not least because there are no pictures after the cover."
3,Interesting articles but it is too short.,I like articles about modern philosophy but I would like to get it more. Jurnal is focus at US. I would like to see more authors from Europe.
2,Incomplete Issue,"I love the Atlantic Monthly and getting it on my Kindle is a real treat. But the article called ""The Idea Factory"" in the October 1, 2011 issue is not all there. It makes me wonder what other content I don't get via Kindle. Please fix this!"
3,Late Delivery,Signed up in November....where is my December issue?Can't think of any reason to get the ebook version late.
1,Time to cancel,"Was it just my copy, or was the feature article ""Making History"" mostly removed from the Kindle edition of the January issue. My feature contains the editorial summary, but none of the four promised essays. Since I have to go to the website and read what should already be on my Kindle, I see no reason to keep my subscription. The Kindle edition is definitely an ignored child, longing for the attention that the print and online editions receive."
4,Good Stuff,"Look forward to reading this magazine every month if and only if they have an article or two especially by Jeffrey Goldberg, Robert D. Kaplan or Mark Bowden. Other than that I do not buy this magazine. The new issue that had Mark Bowden's review of US Air Force was magnificent. They should have more Christopher Hitchens material too. All in all, 4 stars for this magazine."
2,Wrecked by bad format redesign,"I've taken The Atlantic for years, but am on the verge of canceling my subscription. Its latest redesign has made it cheesy and clumsy.Yes, I know the new format was created by a noted design firm (Pentagram), and their circulation has inched upwards.But it's still ugly. It makes me less likely to read the content. And that makes it a waste of time and resources.Most of all, it's a squandered legacy."
2,Really disappointed by the content,"I was really disappointed by the quality of the articles. There is very little logical argumentation and even less facts to back those arguments up. Opinions are OK if they are coming from the guru types, but it does not appear to be the case here. Frankly, authors seem to be guys like you or me who just happen to live in the major urban center on the east coast and got a gig of writing article or two.Halfway between Newsweek and The Economist."
3,Too Long Wait Time,"I purchased the Harper/Atlantic combo from Amazon on Dec 5th, 2007.I received 1st copy of Atlantic in April 2008. To say the wait was unreasonably long would be the understatement of the year. Amazon directed me to call the subscription service ""Magazine Express"" to find out what happened with the subscription. I called several times and each time I was informed the publisher was notified and my case was escalated to a higher priority, etc. The ME customer service was responsive and courteous on each call - except this didn't change the fact that it took almost 5 months to get the 1st copy of Atlantic Monthly delivered.By contrast, Harper's that I purchased through another service at the same time frame, arrived in about 30 days."
1,more hassle than savings,"Amo offered this mag dirt cheap. I bought a subscription, in the 1st week of Nov. The Oct. issue came. Nov issue had not shown Nov 20, went to my acc.>to orders sent request. got email. 2 weeks later the Oct and Nov issue came in an envelope. Now Jan8, still no Dec issue no Jan. I have had many problems with mag subs from Amo. 4 years ago the billing that was trans universally being sent through Uzbakystan or some place was double price. 2 yr.s ago a sub to Mental Floss took 10 emails to get. I am going to order mags from the publisher from now on and shun my eyes when 'amo' sends ads with great deals that will surely pizz me off, boring hassle that saves me $2.25 cents over a years time."
1,Pretentious and boring.,"This magazine is really horrendous--long, wandering, and pedantic articles guaranteed to make you sleep. The most recent issue has a rather pointless story on what kind of debaters Obama and Romney are and how they will most likely fare against each other. After endless paragraphs we finally learn that Obama is a pretty good debator, by God, and that Romney is too. But here's the big dramatic point: Romney sometimes gets flustered when he debates. Stop the presses!A second article goes over familiar territory: if you're against Obama, you're a racist. Except in this case, the writer really means it. You can't say anything bad about Obama because he's black and most likely you aren't. So stop complaining about him. Because if you do, you're a racist.Why would anyone pay a subscription for this kind of stuff?"
5,Great movie,"Very cute movie, all of my children enjoy this movie and watch it over and over. They are 9, 6 and 3! So it is a good movie for the whole family."
5,it has an all animal cast,"Tom Sewyar was never better then in this fully anamated spectacular that follows the adventures of Tom Sewyar [a cat],Rebel [a frog],and Huck Finn [a fox]. Tom falls for Becky Thacher[a cat]who just moved there,which makes his old girl friend Amy Lawrence[a cat]jelouse because she still loves him,but much later Amy falls for Huck.also listen for the all country music sound track."
3,Worth a look,Not an animated classic but a cut above a lot of the stuff that's out there. Nice animation and at least one good song (One Dream).
4,"Wonderful production, fairly faithful adaptation.","Mark Twain's beloved novel has once again been adapted for film, with some subtle changes (Injun Joe becomes Injurin' Joe) and some not-so-subtle ones (all of the characters are animals). However, this new animated version, brought to us by MGM and the same people who made the direct-to-video films ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""An All Dogs Christmas Carol,"" remains a fairly faithful adaptation. It is very, very well animated with a memorable score by Mark Watters. The voice casting, comprising of mostly country music stars with a few veterans like Betty White and Don Knotts, is right on the money. Rhett Akins as Tom Sawyer is simply wonderful. Add to this a selection of great country music songs and you've got good, clean family entertainment."
3,"Good Overall, but expected more.","When I ran into this CD while surfing on this site, it caught my attention based upon the fact that this cd was in an mixed an unmixed formats. Personally, I don't even try to buy mixed cd's anymore because as an amateur DJ is always very hard to use the material to make your own mixes, so I decided to give this I try, probably I expected a sound more like Hed Khandi's Twisted Disco, but overall without being a great cd is good enough to listen to. I personally recommend the first two songs of cd 1 and to be patient with CD 2, it will take some time to digest the music. The problem with the music herein contained is that in four months from now, probably nobody would care about it and the price will drop significantly, so only if you are a die hard fan of this kind of music, give it a try, otherwise, wait a couple of months and get it cheaper."
2,Music,"I found I have not been able to use this cd in class yet as I teach at a primarily large ballet school, the students want to keep away from ballet type music out of ballet class. This CD is full of ballet like music. I would have thought it would be more piano. It is good music, just not suited to what I need."
1,Generic cartridges should be cheaper,"Without a chip, generic cartridges can be bought for as little as $2.00 a piece and most places give you instructions on how to take the chip off an old cartridge and how to fool the printer. If you're going to spend more than $2 or don't have the old chip, get an original. Don't ever spend this much for one without a chip."
1,Please stay away from this product!,"NOT COMPATIBLE WITH IP6600D. AMAZON, HOW COULD YOU LET THIS PRODUCT RUINED YOUR REPUTATION AS THE BEST ONLINE STORE.Just get an original Canon ink. In this case I like to save money but what I got is a hand full of messy ink!"
5,Great Stuff,This really works. Makes your hair thick and is easy to style. A little goes a long way. Great providor. I had it in short time and it was packaged great. Would higly recommend the gel and the providor
5,Hair Care,"This gel is so lightweight. But very, very strong. Keeps my very fine hair bouncy ALL day long ... Love it! Excellent price for the amount of product received."
1,Too good to be true?,"I had to return it. It wouldn't hold a charge and when it did the unit didn't work well. The AM band would pick up a station with a strong signal, but when you changed channels that station could be heard in the background. Wall outlet charging took a long time and when fully charged the performance was poor. Even the spec sheet says 3.5 hours of light life, but it died in a very short time. The details given on the product description here says 7 hours, no that is not true. I gave the solar panel a try and for 2 days on the window sill in direct sunlight it didn't hold a charge and the radio quit working. The spotlight came on a few times, but the flourescent bulb only flickered. I contacted Gama Sonic and they said they no longer carry the unit even thought it's listed on their website. I wish it worked as describe, it would have been nice to own such a product."
1,Save your money,"If you can learn anything from this video, you don't need it. It looks like a VHS version digitized. There is no printed material. The fingering and pick motion are nearly imposible to follow."
5,Freedom's Frontier Re-Visited,"Finial someone is telling the untold story. This DVD is a great documentary on the former East - West German border. I found this DVD both informative and interesting. Maybe this is because I spent 30 months in Bad Hersfeld with the 3rd Recon Sqdn 14th Armored Cav that took part in the border patrol during the Cold War. The DVD is of high quality, well worth the price. I have put a link about this DVD on my web page free of charges to the company ...... http://thedeitz.com/"
1,"Cute, but dysfunctional","I spent a half hour trying to help a couple friends pull footage off a Canon HDDV camera. Not having worked with this camera before, we went through a ton of settings in Final Cut Pro trying to figure out why it wasn't recognized. I glanced at the setup, ""Is this the FireWire cable? What the... it's not shielded is it?!""After swapping in a standard cable, all was well. Dealing with cable voodoo is bad enough already without this madness. Don't torture yourself by buying 'cute' cables."
1,Not to swift!,This was really not good. This is what u find on youtube for free. and 20 minutes over a finger? Paleez.
2,beware!,Beware films with reviews written by the relatives of people on the cast! Of course they are going to give it a high rating!Overall I found it to be kind of amateur. I found myself fast forwarding a lot. I felt like it could have been more than it was. Take my review with a grain of salt as I am a very difficult person to impress.
1,Dead House,"I do love a good haunted house story.Being this one was based on true factsI had high hopes.So here is my review in two words ""Don't Bother"".I rented it then I deleted it.If you want a good haunting storygo with ""Paranormal Witness"".Don't watch at night, alone."
3,decent little cookies,"I was hoping these were WHOLE wheat, but they aren't. (my bad, it never actually claims that on the page) Nevertheless they are pretty good. You do not get much in a package so I'm not sure they are worth the price. They are not too sweet, more like a shortbread, but I like that so I'm not counting it as a negative. They are rather pricey tho."
1,It is no safe,"They dont say that this medicine has cylitol and fructose , that ingredient have a low impacton blood sugar levels"
3,My Child Does Not Care For The Taste.,I can not tell you if this product works or not due to the fact my 5 year old child would not chew these because of the tart taste.
3,"Pleasantly surprised. -Update, not so fast...","We decided to try this product for our 7 year old boy. He is on his way to an ADHD diagnosis. I must say that this product has helped. He never used to be able to entertain himself for very long. Now he will sit and play with lego's ect. He seems more calm. We didn't tell his teacher that we started him on this because we wanted an unbiased opinion on his behavior. Well, our suspicions of improvement were confirmed by his teacher. It doesn't cure everything and children should be allowed to have some hyper moments but it definately helps. Would also recommend a good EPA fish oil as that seems to have some benefit as well.Update one year later:It appears that the attentive child is just not enough of a solution. Although there was some noticeable difference early on it just isnt enough for or son. Hope others have more longer term success than we did. I've dropped the star level to reflect my current opinion."
3,Use with Caution!,"The product definitely worked to help our child pay attention in school, as others have reported.But every child is different. For some, this supplement can cause unpleasant side effects, including anxiety, mood swings, and gastric symptoms. You might want to do some research on the side effects of the ingredients before you begin using this product. If you decide to try it, I would advise you to be cautious, watch your child carefully, and discontinue the use of Attentive Child if you find that overall your child is unexpectedly getting worse instead of better.After being told of the side effects, Amazon kindly refunded the purchase price on our last bottle.***Update: After about 4 weeks of being off Attentive Child, I can confirm that he is feeling like himself again. I could not be more glad to have him off this stuff. Caveat emptor!"
2,very chalky taste,"i bought these at a vitamin store to help with my sons attention span in school. We tried for a week to get him to take it straight. I crushed it clumply and mixed it in yogurt, after he couldn't chew it due to it being so chalky and that didn't work either. I paid a lot of money for them to just go to waist. If your child does not like chalky things, do not purchase this."
2,not really effective,"I did not really see a difference with my child's attention problems. Unfortunately, our family had to resort to a prescription."
1,it didn't work,"I had really high hopes for this product, but it just didnt' work, i'm still very ADD.. :(. I have been taking it regularly for the past month and nothing... I also ordered PS, and i feel it works somewhat.. but ultimately i think it's about self training with ADD... *sigh* the search continues :/"
2,Didn't help us much,"e did't notice much difference with our son, but I don't doubt it may help some other kids. He was originally taking trace minerals and we noticed a difference but things at school were getting worse and it just didn't seem to be enough. We tried the Attentive Child hoping it would be the answer but it wasn't any different than the trace minerals."
2,tastes horrible,"my kids are not big on sugar and this is super sweet ans sour. after the first time, i couldn't bribe them to take it again."
2,no change,I haven't seen a change. And my son been on it for a month. So I decided to go another month and see what's it going to do. If nothing change I will not be purchasing it anymore.
2,So far not so good...,"I purchased these from GNC as an alternative to the Kids Calm we were using, for ease of administering and to ease the whining from the horrible taste of the liquid vitamins. There is a marked decline in my daughter's behavior since the switch. I've been waiting to see the specialist for the inevitable ADHD diagnosis, but Kids Calm had made a noticeable difference. I saw the good reviews here on these wafers and thought we'd give it a try. I'm not impressed. We're back to impulsive and aggressive behavior. I'm sad that I'm out the big bucks I spent on a bottle half the size listed here. I will likely go back to kids calm and begging her to take it. While these taste better and are easier to give, the results just aren't there."
4,Good results,My 8 year old daughter is the pickiest eater I know and taking things like vitamins or medication is always a fight. She does not like the flavor of these vitamins. I tasted them and they have a sweet and sour taste that has a peach flavor. They actually aren't bad if you like peaches. We have a fight over these at night but she will take one tablet. They do make a difference and I am getting good reports from her teacher. We have tried other things that she likes the taste of better but I feel like these deliver the best results. My husband is interested in an adult version of these. You should get great results if you are able to take these and take them consistently. I think consistency is the key. I would highly recommend these to anyone.
2,Evidently it doesn't help everyone,"I've been giving 2 to 3 pills of this product regularly to my 10 year old son on a daily basis for a couple of months or more. I can't tell any difference in his attention span, nor his behavior. I've read great reviews by other Moms and will try anything to help him as long as I know it's safe. This particular product may help others but, just didn't help in our situation. Omega 3 fish oil capsules are still the most effective product we've come across so far. They are well worth the money, but I won't purchase this product again."
1,No Difference :0(,Really dissapointed to say this has had no affect on my 7 yr. old ADHD son. He has been taking 2 wafers per day for 2 months. I'm going to try one more bottle out of desperation & if I see improvement after that I will edit my review.
2,Not Palatable for my child,"I tried this supplement for my 6-year-old boy, but he claimed it made him feel like he was going to throw up. So, I have no way of knowing if it would help him or not. I had high hopes for this product, but if he won't take it, he won't take it. He takes other vitamins just fine--multis, vitamin C, omega-3 and a similar product to this one by another manufacturer. I tasted it and couldn't see what the big deal was. He usually isn't picky. I wasn't able to really elucidate if it was just the taste or the way the wafer made him feel. Hard to get a kid of this age to really pinpoint such things."
4,Attentive Child works,My [...] daughter has been using this product for about six months. She is much more focosed when she is on this product. We have also seen a improvement in her school work.
2,not worth it,Did not do anything to help my son's attention. He did however enjoy the taste; would have liked a childproof top. Big disappointment.
2,I really wanted to like these!,I had very high hopes for these- and unfortunately they have absolutely disappointed me. We are homeschoolers and have BIG problems with focus. These really really really taste terrible. My 7 year old will choke one down and my 5 year old will do it with LOTS of complaining but my 2 year old LOVES vitamins and he will NOT eat these. I'm sad they cost so much or I would just trash them. After we choke down this bottle we will not order them again.
2,Tastes bad,Bought this for my son with ADHD and he hated the taste. He refused to even chew one wafer and threw it out. Money wasted.
4,"Good, but big","Two of these big wafers takes my 6 year old a long time to eat, but this really seems to help him focus."
2,Not All Originals,"Beware -- only a few of the songs on this CD are the original versions. Others are re-recordings, many lacking the excitement of the original recordings."
3,Delivery as promised.,"Good delivery time. Not excellent. Shipping and handling was a bit high.If I had not absolutely needed immediately, I would have kept looking."
4,Gorgeous Voice,"Hard to go wrong with a gorgeous singer with a gorgeous voice transporting us to another time and another place with bossa nova, light samba, or Portguese ballads ... about the only complaint is the CD could use more tracks ... other than that - great."
3,"Good set, poor selection","They could have seperated this set into Greatest Villians of the 80's and greatest heros of the 80's. Alot of talented stars- Ted DiBiase, Randy Savage, Mr.Perfect, Rick Rude, Road Warriors, British Bulldogs, etc are left off. This set could have been a 20 disc set and I still would have purchased it."
3,Disappointing,"First off, the Wrestlemania III match between Steamboat/Savage is NOT in this set. All you get is the little highlight package (which is exactly the same one included in the Wrestlemania XX DVD in the 10 Best Wrestlemania Matches).The matches are decent, not great. The WWF in the 80s had great stars, but the matches weren't of the best quality. What really comes across in this set how much better NWA matches were than WWF matches. The only real gem in this set is Flair/Steamboat from Chi-Town Rumble '89. An incredible classic.What's really disappointing are the pieces on the individual wrestlers. The one on Ricky Steamboat is nice, and it's great to hear from him in interview form, but the rest of the stuff is just rehashed from the old WWE Confidential series. The stuff with Flair is either from his DVD or from WCW.Overall, some decent stuff here, but it could have been so much more."
3,where were these?,"where were these in the best of the 80'S?Slaughter vs. Shiek - bootcamp matchHogan and Mr.T vs. Piper and Orndorf wm 1Hogan vs. Andre WM 3 (how can there be a best of 80's without this)Hogan vs. orndorf CageTully Blanchard vs. Magnum T. I quit CageSavage vs. Steamboat wm 3Savage vs. Hogan wm 5The only real good ones are the dog collar match from starrcade and the chi town rumbble- Flair Steamboat.I didnt buy the dvd, too dissapointing.They leave out all these classics and put in garbage Like orandorf vs. some jobber, urgh they really screwed this one up like they did the road warrior dvd"
1,"what a JOKE! where is Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage????","I'm wondering how far Vince McMahon's hatred of Randy Savage goes? How in blue blazes could he leave him OFF this compilation of 80's greats?This is fun...lots of cool stuff and fun bio's and matches...certainly many retreads from other collections but again...Macho Mans absence is ridiculous!Thanks goodness greed prevailed and Mr McMahon has released the ""Macho Madness"" 3 dvd set..."
3,It looks good but is full of holes,"WWE has the greatest archieve of wrestling footage in the world..why do they keep on handing out crappy dvds? This dvd could have been spilt into two sets-early and late 80's. I was thinking of purchasing this dvd, but reading the matches makes me sigh. Sure, they are classic but alot of stars are missing from the set. Sometimes WWE is hit and miss with there dvds, this one seems to hit for alot of people but not for me. They are scheduled to finally release an Undertaker dvd set, im just praying they actully make it good and not waste 3 discs of matches from the 2000 and up Undertaker."
5,Same as Daniel Epps,"I to was suprised to see this dvd set at a local Wal-Mart. I only paid around $20 for mine after a friend that worked there got me a discount. I hope they come out with a ""Greatest Wrestling Stars of The 90's"" next. This is a must own for any loyal wrestling fan and dvd collector."
4,Relive Childhood Memories,"WWE produces good quality documentary DVDs (I can't always say the same about their raunchy live shows). This is another well-made, interesting, and entertaining WWE DVD.It brought back lots of memories for me. A lot of the 80s gimmicks seem corny and overly tame by today's standards, but they seemed pretty dumb to me at the time, too, and I was just a kid.One sort of sad thing is to see Bobby Heenan's commentary. He doesn't sound or look anything like he used to. He appears gaunt and withdrawn and slurs his words. He says with a touch of sadness in his voice that he misses the days of going out there and entertaining the fans (realizing, I'm sure, that he will never again be a personality on any wrestling programming)."
4,Good not great.,This was a very good DVD. It was just missing so much stuff. I really liked the way they did the superstar's biographies. Very informative. Would have liked to have seen Jesse Ventura and others though.
3,Could have been much better,"Ok, I am a HUGE Ric Flair fan and crave any dvd with his matches on it. I bought this dvd set to have the Chi-Town Rumble 89 match with The Dragon. However, wwe made strange choices to include the million dollar match with Dusty. Hech, the match only lasted 15 min and was stopped early because of a cut to Dusty's eye. What a joke! WWE should have included the match where Flair wins the title from Dusty in 81..The Fourhorsemen Interview is killer. Any fan will love that. The retrospective on Flair is mostly on Flairs 3DVD set, BUT the retro on Rick Steamboat is way cool with lots of references to Flair. Another bad choice by the WWE was not included the full match from Wrestlemania 3 with Savage and Steamboat. The DVD only gives ""highlights"". Maybe they are saving that one for a Savage DVD set??? I also liked the stuff with The Hammer and with Piper. So, overall this dvd has alot of hits and alot of misses.."
2,Nothing New,I purchased this book hoping to hear something new but unfortunately most everything in the book has all be told time and time again. There are also some poor stretches for an easy memory tip. For me it was a waste of money.
5,Another SMASH Hit for Westlife,"The best thing in this album is the song I HAVE A DREAM. Just to say that if you hear them sing this song then ""YOU'LL BELIEVE IN ANGELS"" and they're called WESTLIFE."
4,seasons in the sun,"I find the group to be good in their music and presentations. Matured music, as compared to other boy bands."
5,This is an epidemic that we need to know more about,"I used this book when researching my thesis on columnaris and adhesion. It is very important, especially for freshwater aquaculturists, to get this book and learn more about columnaris. It strikes salmonids as well as channel catfish in the southeast. It hits all life stages, sizes, weights. And there is still so much to know... But this book is an informative place to start."
2,I felt ripped off.,"I own the 1995 and 1996 editions of Holt's East and West guide books. Recently I bought the ""2002"" editions. Other than the cover and correcting a few errors, they are the same. The books themselves are of average value. A better choice is the Flyfisher's Guide to Montana."
3,Reprinted not Updated,"I ordered both the East and West Books by Holt. The copyright was 1995 and 1996. I called Lyons Press and these are the most recent books available. Lyons Press just reprinted them in 2002, but nothing was updated or rewritten from the original books. So beware, the content is 10+ years old, even though the covers are 2002 vintage."
4,SABINA en DVD en el Gran Rex de Bs.As.,"El concierto en el Gran Rex es bueno, me hubiera gustado que el Maestro Sabina publique un DVD basado el disco Nos sobran los motivos, grabado en la gira del mismo nombre. el cual es un material semi-compilatorio del Cantautor, imposible de llamarlo una compilacion de grandes temas cuando estos son incontables.El audio del DVD no es tan bueno, siendo en estereo, pero la maestria de Sabina y sus musicos compensa cualquier falencia en el sonido."
5,The best Holiday CD around,"This is the best cd to play during the holidays. The music is lively, easy to listen to and puts you in that cozy mood...so let it snow or rain, with Clairdee singing you're assured of a mellow holiday."
5,Awsome!!,"A great book for an Quilter, or beginner. She explains the patterns with clear instructions and fun pictures. For some who have never Quilted before or have some experience. If you are a hard core quilter,this is not for you. It is for beginer quilters. But all around, awesome!"
5,wonderful to have,"you can trust that patchwork place to get a fabulous book in you hands. now the projects begin! simple to read, cutting directions are great and the layouts are beautiful. this will be a well used book in my studio!"
2,Sofa Side Table Review,Disappointed that item arrived damaged. One of the leg braces was almost completely separated from the table top. I had to glue brace as best I could. I did not want to go thru the hassle of trying to return it. This is the second item I have purchased from Amazon that was delivered damaged. FYI - Box did not indicate that it was damaged during shipment.
3,Too much of the same,"Well... I know the works of James Horner. I must admit he's one of the best but, lately, he's copying himself in his scores. Hearing this score, you can find lots of similarities with Bravehaeart or Titanic. To be a good composer, one must be original..."
2,FYI:Piano Duet,"the name of the piano piece that ""Little Miss"" dueted with Andy is the Berceuse from Gabriel Faure's 'The Dolly Suite.' This piano duet was written for the child Dolly Bardac, whose mother later married Claude Debussy. Titles of other movements include lighthearted references to Dolly's cat (Mi-a-ou and Kitty-Valse)."
3,Answer to question,"In answer to A Music Fan's question, the female singer in the movie is Paula West. She has a couple C.D.'s out which you can find on line at Amazon."
5,This is NOT another Titanic,"Anything Celine Dion touches turns to gold. She again tackles a movie song and it's written by the same guys that did ""My Heart Will Go On"" for Titanic. Why that song was perfect, this one is beyond that. ""Then You Look At Me"" is one of Celine's finest. It's criminal that it wasn't up for an Oscar but those who listen to it knows that it should have been."
3,A must for new shooters.,"Book is well organized and provides a good summary of one man's experience. It is not however, the last word on all aspects of loading black powder cartridges. A beginning black powder loader will find helpful information on all aspects of loading black powder cartridges. The book leans heavily towards .45 caliber but the information is equally applicable to .38, .40, or .50 cals. The book recommends many specific products and provides addresses from which the reader can order. Altogether, a valuable reference that even experienced shooters will find enjoyable."
3,the LI scene is getting old,"What can i say about the cd? Its far from great. The singers voice sounds like a mix between the taking back sunday singer meets glassjaws singer meets the singer from die trying.At first i hated it but after some time had past i got over it. the lyics are not anything special but they have their moments. The verses seem to be the best part of the song. The music is not the best but ok. I sugjest u DL this cd. I mean this band could be taking back sunday, glassjaw, and even die trying. I think the singer has a crush on the guy from die trying cuz he copys him to a T. He even does the come ons. so yea DL this cd dont waste ur money on it. but if you do listen to it and let it grow on you so u wont feel like u wasted ur money."
3,Great collection fo music and artist information.,"I, like many states-siders, remember only three songs by the Tremeloes. This is a collection of 48 songs that were released as singles through the 60s and 70s The tracks are in chronological order so you can hear the band grow and mature. The liner notes that come with the two disk set is short and to the point but very small print. My only complaint is the sound quality. They maximized the volume to the point of distortion. It is almost un-noticeable unless you have one of the old vinyl recordings to compare it to. It still sounds better than the scratches and clicks on the vinyl. I would give it five stars if the fidelity was a little better."
5,A great film about the power of forgiveness,"This film is strait up about forgiveness and the power that it has to set you free from anger, oppression and hurt. It's from a Christian perspective and though some people have a biased opinion against that perspective, the film speaks for itself. An amazingly uplifting story."
5,Insights into Fascism,I wasn't really expecting anything as good as this when I bought the book. I mainly was interested in reading about a Christian's understanding of Christianity and a Christian's understanding of fascism. This book provided 100 times more insights into both Christianity and fascism than I ever expected it to.Highly recommended.
1,ET PHONE HOME - Crap!,"I purchased, activated and registered this software and now it FREEZES MY SYSTEM every time I try to use it unless I let the son of a _____ phone home to momma on the web. This BALL AND CHAIN software licensing stinks and should be brought to a halt by refusal to purchase!"
1,Avoid Nuance,I never did use this. It was way too buggy. I have found that to be true of every Nuance product I have purchased. They seem to buy okay programs/companies and then milk them year after year with poorly tested updates until they finally become unusable.
1,Doesn't even install!,"Don't even think about buying this software. It's a waste of money and time. My copy didn't even install. It threw up an ""AddPrinterDriver"" error. My machine is a standard Windows XP SP2 machine - nothing special. Just pony up the few extra dollars and buy the Adobe product. You'll be much happier. Now I have a $90 software package taking up space in my trash can."
1,Useless,"It worked horribly, if it worked at all. The main purpose I bought this is to convert pdf document into MS Word. The word file is barely useable - the formating is messed up, the font is changed, etc. If you want to generate pdf from word, it does not work well either. Some figures are completely messed up. ScanSoft software is a big joke for any serious use. It is not even worth $10."
2,Better than Version 2...I hope!,"Version 2 of this product was highly overrated in my opinion, with PDF-to-Word conversions fair at best. Format preservation is usually mediocre and requires significant post-conversion editing. Upgrade rebate/cost is an insult to users who were, and will be, ScanSoft's beta-testers. Supplied macros often cause Microsoft Office applications to load slowly and/or crash. Updates and needed fixes to Version 2 rarely materialized during its life-cycle."
3,Not Windows XP64 compatible,In the search for a good pdf software I tried this. The box does not specify which XP verisions it is compatible with. Well it isn't 64xp. On contacting tech support they have no plans to support Windows 64XP. They did refund my money. Sigh...
1,Where's the upgrade rebate?,"Where's the upgrade rebate for the loyal customers that bought the prior version, which is not as good as the claims? Oh, but this is the company that charges you money to tell them of a flaw in their own program. Incredible how poor these clowns run this company."
2,Why you should avoid this product,"The advertising hype about this software sounds great. The truth is far less. Trying to convert PDF to Adobe there were so many errors, I could have typed it from scratch faster! Plus once it installs and takes over as your main PDF reader, WATCH OUT! Many pages won't load at all, others load much slower than with Adobe. Some just come up blank.Deal around this waste of money and time!"
2,Product is fine. Paying for support is not.,"The product is fine when it works, but after a while it crashed my system. I tried to get support from the company - they wanted to charge me $10????I paid, but it left me with a bad feeling. I would probably look for an alternative if I did not already own this."
2,Not a great CD Mastering,"In my humble opinion, there are only 2 truly great recordings of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D Major - Haifetz with the Chicago Symphony and Kung-Wa Chung's. These are the only peformers who capture for me the gypsy spirit of this magnificent piece. The CD mastering of the Heifetz version in this recording is terrible. Even on a good system, it is screechy and irritating. I have a Time-Life LP recording of this performance which is much better, crackles and all. Lovers of this masterwork who like to hear it played with a full range of emotion would be better advised to get the Kung-Wa Chung version which has been recorded with more up-to-date technology. This CD does no service to the great Heifetz."
2,"Bird Bath looks good, that is about it. Amazon Purchase.","I purchased this item as it looked very nice. Three weeks after having it the finish in the bird bath bowl started lifting and peeling. As it is only plastic paint over a plastic bowl and stand,the water sitting in the bowl is causing the paint finish to lift. So with time the whole bowl will be black in color. I guess I will have to put blue glass stones in the bowl so the birdies will know what it is. For $30.00+ including, keep you money in your pocket is my recommendation!!!!"
1,Gardman bird bath,"This bird bath is very light weight. It's attractive, but not fit for the Colorado wind. Also, the birds did not come to it."
1,terrible quality/overpriced,bought this exact item in March 2011 it is BARELY worth the NINE dollars that I paid for it - but not worth more than that. The top does not screw on - we gave up trying to put it together - we are just using the bowl part on the ground for the wild critters and birds in the flower garden to drink and bathe from.
4,Nice But the Color is Deceiving in Picture,"This is very nice and it was easy to put together; however, the color shown in the picture is deceiving. To me, the deciding factor was that the birdbath appeared to have some blue coloring in it. I was disappointed that there is no blue at all; the birdbath shown in the picture is filled with water that has blue coloring added to it, making the appearance of the birdbath more colorful than it really is. Besides the color issue, I'm very pleased with the birdbath. It is sturdy, came with some spikes to keep it attached to the ground, and is a very good value."
5,Very pretty - pleased with birdbath,"Yes, this is a resin birdbath, which is good for us because we have rambunctious dogs and live in tornado alley - no broken birdbaths on the horizon! You can fill the base with sand if you want to keep this on a deck or you can stake it into the ground with stakes that are provided. It's a pretty bird bath and easy to clean as well."
2,Bad Experience,"Maybe this was just the seller's bad packing because this arrived in torn up package (item box only, no padding or outer box) and would not stand up straight. I had it on a level surface (checked with a level) and the water markedly shifted to one side. It was also missing the anchors and is NOT 2"" deep.If the depth is not an issue for you, I suggest ordering from someone else. The seller made me pay the return shipping even though the product was not as discribed (not 2"" deep) and either defective or damaged."
3,It's plastic!,"Beautiful bird bath and I kept it instead of returning despite the fact it's made of plastic. It doesn't weigh much and the stakes for stabilizing it are too short. I'm also worried about chemicals leeching out of the plastic into the water the birds bathe in because it's always out in the hot sun here in Florida. It's beautiful, but it's PLASTIC!"
2,Antique copper?,"I realize I probably should have read the description a little more carefully so that I would have seen that it was resin, but I'm not a huge fan. It seems pretty cheap. With shipping, it seems a little steep for 30 dollars for how cheap it seems."
1,Plastic,This thing sucks. It is not advertised properly. It looks nothing like the picture and it is not copper. Its plastic. I was extremely disappointed with it. I had bought it for my future mother in law and couldnt bring myself to give it to her. It just looked so cheap.
3,Looses its finish,"I purchased this bird bath about a year ago. It's functional because it holds water and the birds use it some but not as much as my larger bird bath that is deeper. I know it's recommended that the depth of the water not be more than 2"" deep however my larger bath is deeper and gets more visitors. The water drips over the scalloped edging of this bath when the birds use it, thus requiring more refills. Also the finish on the inside came off and lost its antique copper look. There are ridges on the inside which also makes it difficult to clean. I still use it during the summer but I wouldn't buy another one."
4,i like it but...,looks great fairly easy to assemble but the paint peels off at the waterline inside the bowl. hopefully the rest of it won't peel off too.
1,Terrible product,After having this bird bath for only 3 weeks all of the paint had peeled off and chunks of it were floating in the water. Amazon should not be selling this product.
4,"not a bad bottle, but better to buy in a store","I like that this sippy cup gives measurements, unlike their other 10 oz sippy cup and I like the handles, not that my son cares about or uses them yet. I do not like how harrow the opening is - I have to use a funnel to get the formula into the bottle without spilling it everywhere. But as a sippy cup and not a bottle, a lot of people probably don't use it for formula anyway. And I do not like that Amazon gives you no choice in color - they sent me a purplish pinkish bottle, that is a bit too feminine for my taste."
2,Okay But Error Filled,"Adam Webb has done a good thing by bringing attention to Dennis Wilson's wonderful music. But this book needed some decent editing and fact checking in a big way. Webb continually makes mistakes that even the novice Beach Boy fan would catch. For example by stating that Dennis was not at the ""Surfin"" sessions. It is well documented that Dennis was there, his voice is obviously on the recording, and he sang a lead line on the B-side ""Luau"". Webb also states that Dennis sang lead on ""Catch A Wave"". No. That was Mike Love. Webb states that Brian's song ""Lay Down Burden"" was on his BW solo LP when in fact it was on his ""Imagination"" LP. These kind of annoying errors are rampant in this book. It takes away from the believability and enjoyment factor in my opinion."
2,"Good intentions, not-so-good results","Besides the lack of fact-checking mentioned above, I was bothered by the lack of basic writing skills Webb displays. The occasional misplaced apostrophe I can ignore, but this book is rife with mistakes, the most annoying of them being the author's habit of using incomplete sentences.However, if you're not bothered by that sort of thing, this book is a quick and interesting (if not particularly accurate) read."
5,games,I bought this game for my son who loves gumby. He plays it alot alomst more than the modern games he has. It works like a new game. It was packaged very well.
5,3 boys love this toy!,"Our nephew and two sons love this game and are constantly waiting their turn to play it. They are all under the age of 8, but it is definitely a favorite for the three of them."
3,A depressing film,"A good one for masochists. It is actually quite well done, but if you are not interested in fallen heroes, don't bother. If you want a good clinical analysis, buy it."
3,Star-studded,"It's a decent, entertaining film, filled with star cameos. However, as is often the case, the plot veers off wildly from the original book by Philip MacDonald, which I enjoyed much more. In short, while I would (and have) re-read the book, I have no real desire to see the film again."
4,Farcical and Fun!,"A fun little mystery to unravel with a bit of something for everyone . . . spies, murder, intrigue, romance, ancestral homes, steeple chases . . . it's like discovering a long-lost Alfred Hitchcock does Agatha Christie!"
3,"JOHN HUSTON, OPUS 21","Good mystery thriller filmed with some distanciation by John Huston. as the post final credits sequence confirms it. Joseph MacDonald, in charge of the photography department, proposes two or three scenes that could have been found in a Val Lewton production. Robert Mitchum is the only star I recognized among the cameos. So if you want to pass an agreeable evening, take a look at this rare little gem. Recommended."
4,Good old movie,I had seen this movie many years ago and thought it unique. It was enjoyable to see it again and would recommend it for anyone who hasn't seen it. Great plot twist.
4,The List of Adrian Messenger,A very entertaining movie with lots of stars in cameo roles (goodluck finding them all). I had been looking for this movie on DVD for years-be aware that it will not play on a DVD player which also records-not a problem since a play only device can be bought very cheaply.
5,marvelous mystery,This is a fantastic mystery with incredible cameos. Both a great mystery and fun on the way to finding out who did it and why.
3,This Messenger is a Massage,"The List of Adrian Messenger is a gimmick film. Can you spot the heavily disguised stars--Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Robert Mitchum and Frank Sinatra? Unfortunately, if you're of a certain age, you can detect the one central to the mystery, alas. The film is based upon a classic of the same name by Philip MacDonald which I should reread. One gets considerable pleasure watching this rube goldberg assembly. George C. Scott is not quite credible as an English detective, but is always fun to watch. One wonders why Dana Wynter's career failed to flourish. The identity of the murderer must be buried good and deep and to do so a number of characters must be buried good and deep as well. Will the old gentleman and the young heir be dispatched by the villain under the cover of fox hunt accidents? Will Wynter's frost yield to the Villain's heat?Will Great Scott prevail? It's a fun ride. Tallyho! all."
4,THE MASTER JOHN HUSTON CRAFTS ANOTHER WINNER,"THIS MOVIE, WITH ITS ASSORTMENT OF WONDERFUL ACTORS, BOTH RECOGNIZABLE AND NOT, WILL HOLD YOUR INTEREST THROUGHOUT. THE STORY, A MYSTERY FINALLY SOLVED BY THE AGILE MIND OF GEORGE C. SCOTT, IS FUN TO FOLLOW FROM BEGINNING TO END. ENJOY!"
4,DVD! DVD! DVD! DVD!,"The List of Adrian Messenger is a wonderful change of pace for Mr. Huston. I wish to see it again, but my VCR went up in a ball of flame years ago.DVD! DVD! DVD! DVD!"
4,A Chuckle on Every Page,"If you've had enough of all those nauseating sugar frosted ""self help"" books that flood the market, try this one! A true curmudgeon's choice. Biting sarcasm and satire, (For those of you in Rio Linda, that means it's mocking) it warms the cockles of my jaded heart. There is more than a little truth in these tales for the cynical. In fact, this would be a good primer for those who don't have a grip on reality, but would like to try it. Face it, LIFE STINKS! A few cartoons would have been a nice touch, but you can't have everything.(I won't give up trying to GET everything) For those of you who are offended by this book, I'll speak very slowly so even YOU can understand it, IT'S HUMOR."
5,best book i ever read.,"this book is so twisted. it's way up there on my ""books that rule"" list. actually, it's the top book."
3,"Not hilarious, not worth the money","Several smiles, three laughs out loud. Cute but not all that funny. Dave Barry or the Onion staff would've done a much funnier job. Save your money."
1,"Not thick enough to stop a bullet, but just enough to read","I got this book as a gift in June. I had suffered an accident while unloading a truck. A huge printer slipped and fell onto my leg, which put me into the hospital for about a week while I had a few operations done. I was hoping this book would help me pass the time, but the dark heart that wrote this shed no light upon the world and only continued to showcase all that is wrong in the world. I was hoping it would be a little bit uplifting, but it's not, and to top it off, it's not funny either. The title is witty, but that's where the inventiveness stopped with this book. Don't waste your money."
1,"Terribly lacking in humor, writing skill, and planning...","The stories in this book were advertised as being incredibly funny but they AREN'T. The only funny part was the title of this book. This could have been such a funny and entertaining read if it weren't for the poor planning and lousy writing skills. The writer is lacking in the most important area of all and that's called ""talent"". This book gets a big fat ""F"". It's a safe wager to make that the author, Mr. Fisher, also got ""F's"" on his What I Did On My Summer Vacation essays in school.Isn't it funny how the positive reviews come from ""A READER"" and not Amazon certified ""REAL NAME""? That certainly says it all. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
4,Dynasty 4,I got a little confused this time with so many of the characters having the same name. I would like for the family tree to be clearer. I am really interested in the American branch now.
3,Bored with this one.,"After reading the first three books in the Morland dynasty, I couldn't wait to start this one. It started out promising but by the end I kept checking how close I was to being done. I felt a disconnect with this book and never felt like it was as engrossing and exciting as the others. None of the characters seemed to develop for me as they have previously. I usually feel like I know them inside and out; in this case I kept getting people confused because she jumped back and forth so much. I am starting on book 5 now. Fingers crossed it will be more like the first three books."
5,What wonderful memories,"When I gave up all my vinyl, this was one of the albums that I regretfully said goodbye to. I love Livingston Taylor and his music. I still remember having every word, note and nuance from this album memorized during my high school and college daysFrom the folky version of ""Over the Rainbow"" and the dynamic ""Loving Be My New Horizon,"" Liv's voice has that wonderful rich Taylor quality that inspired me to sing to my children. It's good to see that I *can* replace my old vinyl and share my memories with my kids."
5,i give this young lady a 10+ on her singing,"i have just discovered jennifer and the jetz music as of last year. i/my spouse really enjoy her music, easy listen music to listen to on your way to work or when going out. dancing to is even better. i see jennifer as another selena in the future. keep up the good work. think positive always and keep going forward."
5,Great Tabouli,"I love Tabouli this product is great, I make mine with diced cucumber, and dices of the tomato 'meat' minus the seedy soggy center. I have to watch it, as I could eat this stuff all day long. SO GOOD!!"
3,It's ok.,But for [the price] there are others much better than this. The songs are mostly 2 minutes long and are not mixed. So the trance element isn't there.
2,Good songs,But not mixed. That takes away from the trance type of feel of flowing from one song to the next.
2,Missing the good remixes,"""Wonderful"" is one of the better tracks off Annie Lennox's ""Bare"" CD, and both this and ""A Thousand Beautiful Things"" topped the Billboard Dance Chart in 2004. However, the good mixes for these two songs are missing from the CD singles.These are the two mixes you want to look for -A Thousand Beautiful Things (Peter Rauhofer's Beautiful Strings Anthem)Wonderful (Dave Aude Mix)So far, not to be found on any CD release."
5,The best Cd I have ever heard!,"This Cd is the best Cd I have ever heard.the first part of this beautiful Cd are real Jazz songs like ""Protocol"",""Daddy's Blues"",""A promise kept"" or ""A waltz for Emma"" and the second part is a real 2000 funk . I have never heard such funky songs like ""What are you doing later on"" or ""The night is still young"" or especially ""Slammin"", there you can hear that Alphonse Mouzon is a very great pianist and he plays not less than 14 different instruments and he plays them all super. In the third part there are Africian and Brasilian influences.For me ( and I think also for you) that's the best Cd for a drummer you can get! Not less than 5 solo parts /songs are included on this WORLDBEST cd.BUY IT!Thanks to Alphonse!NIKI"
4,Wish there were more Instrumentals,"Not because he cannot sing, because he can, and very well. I have heard the 2 instrumentals on the local Smooth Jazz station and during Art Good's Jazz Tracks show.I have always been a fan of Ray Parker Jr. His music with Raydio (RELEASE THESE ON CD!!!!) is awesoms. Songs like You Can't Change That, Rock On & Get Down are awesome and funky. His solo stuff lags for me but is good. Even his session work (most notably guitar on Boz Scagg's Jojo) is great.This cd is a good relaxing cd. The 2 instrumentals are the best cuts. I wish they were longer and that there were more of them. All i can say is BUY THIS ALBUM! If he sees good sales, he'll release more!I'd also like to see a cd by him of smooth jazz renditions of some of his old solo and Raydio hits. Maybe even covers of songs like Jojo that he played on.ROCK ON Ray Parker Jr.!"
1,2nd Review,"Apparently Ray doesn't like negative reviews because my first review didn't get posted. Here it is again. This album is terrible. The only reason there are so many positive reviews is because an email was sent out by a ""friend"" asking people to create fake reviews in hopes to bolster the album sales. Guess what! It's still a bad record! Don't be fooled - just sing along to your old Ghostbusters audio cassette and remember the good ol' days."
4,Pleasant entertainment.,"Don't expect any help from this book. It's a very pretty picturebook of soft-core porn, the sort of thing you'd give to your fiance on Valentine's Day. Enjoy it for what it is!"
3,i like classic r\b,aryhur has some of the otis redding sound and does a good job of keeping you enthused throughout each performance
5,"INCREDIBLE, FEARLESS, REFRESHING TRUTHTELLER OF REAL HISTORY - PURE OBJECTIVITY AND FACT","Nice article on one of the most courageous writers of history today. Norman Davies has established himself as purely credible and fearlessly going against the grain when necessary: bravely challenging the distorters of truth.

4,Genuine and unique,"If this movie were Hollywood-ized, it would have been terrible, forgettable, and a flash in the pan. Luckily, the creative team behind this movie stuck to their guns and made a genuine film about grief and two sisters trying to reconnect. What sticks out most is the realism aspect of the drama. A couple minor flaws here and there, but overall it's a beautiful piece and highly recommend you watch it. :-)"
5,Awesome,I received this product super quickly and had it installed in an hour and a half! I increased fuel economy by 2 MPG in my 03 Explorer. The sound is mellow and quiet at cruising speeds. Perfect.
4,Gibson 319691 Single exhaust system,"Have to agree with the bigbadhawk, did not fit well over rear axle. Heated things with a torch and with a little persuasion, things fit better. Have had no problem with rubbing on the rear diff. Along with the K & N cold air kit, have achieved an increase of over 3 mpg highway and 1.5 mpg in town. Nice rumble at lower rpms, barley noticeable at highway speeds."
2,You get what you pay for.,"the fit over the rear axle isnt very good, rubs on diff.Not much louder than stock muffler.Chrome exhaust tip turned goldish in color in two days."
2,Interesting but relatively basic overviews,"Easy to read and interesting, but I think the title of this book is deceiveing. Although the book has good info, it is by no means an ""advanced"" manual for repairing cameras.Many tips and techniques are just overviews, without specific step by step instructions. I was left longing for more detail.I understand that to cover all the cameras listed in total detail would be an enormous and impractical task, I think it would be a better book if it were to focus more specifically and in more detail on one or two cameras."
3,Good if book applies to your cameras,"Book 1 was more for advanced beginners-intermediates. It covered mostly older, mechanical cameras. This book covers a lot of electronic cameras. Good repair shortcuts for advanced DIY camera mechanics. Not for beginners or those afraid of getting into a camera's innards. I liked it because it helped me fix one camera, thus more than paying for itself. It's not for everyone-it's not a universal book. Neither was Book 1, for that matter. Not useful if your camera isn't covered. VERY useful if it is. Check table of contents carefully before you order."
2,camera repair,"too few illustrations, too much ""figure out the construction"", too much ""make notes"", that is not helpfull"
5,one of the best pieces of fiction i've seen lately,"this book was excellent, the story of a psychotic, pedofile priest and his insane delusions, highly reccomended"
2,Over arranged and dated,"I loved Patricia Kaas in ""And Now Ladies and Gentlemen"" and I hoped to get a CD of her piano bar style as seen in the film. Unfortunately, this CD has horible arrangements and orchestration: echo-y, with a real dated sound of synthesized keyboard and electronic rhythm. Patricia Kaas would sound fabulous in a more ""unplugged"" version- ala Diana Krall, featuring her alluring voice and a simple piano, base and drum arrangement. This CD makes the songs sound very cheesy. Very disapointing!"
5,Thanks for great service and just the album I wanted.,Anything Patricia Kaas does is great! She is the consummate jazz/pop/torch singer. Her choices for material are always great and she works with some fabulous musicians to back her up.
1,Can put you to sleep very easily....,"As much as I love Patricia Kaas' voice, I must say that the monotonous beat of this album, from first note to last, can leave you wishing for an espresso bar instead of a Piano Bar.This is a very self-indulgent album, that only the French might consider ""Cool.""Do yourself a favor and buy some Burt Bacharach and Elvis Costello and some Cohen. At least those songs leave you with something to think about, much like a self-induced hallucination acquired by night at a hookah-smoking Piano Bar."
1,Disappointed.,I'm very disappointed that almost entire CD is in English. She sounds so romantic in French.
3,"Don't expect much, these are from tape...low quality, but they are on dvd!","For starters, Code Red just wanted to get these two lost classics out. The negatives must be lost, because these are from tape and it shows. These are low res that is one grade better than VHS. White Rat looking the worse (if its possible). Not truly disappointed, these movies are decent for what they are. Do not spend a whole lot of money on this title. Can't believe Code Red would release such inferior product. Amazon should have stated that these are bad prints, then let us decide if we want them or not. The 1.33 framed movies are decent enough, they are the reason for the three stars. The DVD gets two stars. BUY WITH CAUTION!! You have been warned!"
1,not compatable with my dell latitude D520,"got delivered fast. put it in and my dell latitude d520 would not recognize it. i called dell, no help because it wasn't from them. called the battery company, they were friendly but could not solve my problem. they also said they'd call me back which they never did. they were going to see if it was possibly just the one i received and get permission to send me a new one. i returned it and they gave me a full credit. i was trying to save $ but i had to order a new battery from dell. that lasted less then 6 months. now i'm using my plug again."
1,Not worth it,"I purchased my replacement battery in February 2009, and it didn't last 9 months. When I checked into the warranty, Lenmar requested that I pay for shipping, insurance, and prepay the shipping of the new battery back to me. By the time you pay for those charges, you've spent about half of what the current price of the battery is. I decided it wasn't worth the trouble for another low quality battery, so I went to my local Batteries Plus store to buy the next replacement."
1,"piece of dookie, and dookie doesn't hold a charge after a few months","If you want to revive your relatively old Dell laptop so that the charge lasts, go out and spend the money on a real Dell battery. It's still cheaper than a new computer!"
4,great deal!,"Very pleased with my purchase, the battery arrived very quickly and so far works great. I'm happy that I purchased the battery through here instead of ordering one from Dell that would have cost way more."
5,Based on Authentic jacket of WW2 Pilot of Marvin Lubinsky,"Marvin Lubinsky, 88, formerly of Port Washington, passed away on April 29, 2009 at Mease Hospital in Dunedin, FL. He was born on Dec. 12, 1920 in Lima, OHHe was a veteran of the U.S. Army Air Force and served his country during WWII as a B-17 pilot in the Eighth Air Force (447th Bomb Group). He and his crew flew 30 missions in Europe. He was awarded a Distinguished Flying Cross.His bomber jacket is on display at the United States Air Force Museum in Dayton, OH. In 2002, Hasbro Inc. used his jacket as a model for one of its GI Joe action figures. In recent years, Marvin took great joy in speaking to students about his experiences during WWII."
2,"Good band, mediocre book","While the book is worth reading once to catch some interesting tidbits, Spellman is a mediocre writer. For instance, he several times refers to The Ramones as ""the Grateful Dead of punk,"" which really doesn't make much sense. Both bands were together for a long time but the similarities pretty much end there. Are there many essential Ramones albums? Yes. Is this their essential biography? No."
1,Save your Money,This book does not provide any useful information about The Ramones. One of music's most pivotal bands deserves more than the brief overview Bressman offers. He has the reader believe that through good times and bad these guys always loved each other-anyone see Dee Dee at the rock and roll hall of fame ceremony?American Band is like a thin sandwich. What you get is a year by year account from 1974 to 1992 with very little to chew on in between.Read Dee Dee's books if you want more information-if you can follow his train of thought. 'Please Kill Me' is a good starting point if you want to get a good overview of the whole punk phenom.American Band's saving point-it had some pictures I hadn't seem before.
2,It irritated me!,Bessman's over use of exclamation points drove me nuts! Joey was tall! They had black hair! They wear leather jackets! See how annoying that is!
4,"Fun, loving look at the Ramones.","Ramones fans will want to read this, it is relentlessly favorable to them (excuses for not-so-great albums, etc.) but we do love them and forgive them, don't we?"
2,"not too bad, but there's better!","cool look at a cool era, but even better is ""High On Rebellion; Inside The Undeground At Max's Kansas City"" by Yvonne Sewell Ruskin, loaded with NY Dolls/Johnny Thunders,Psychotic Frogs,Jayne County, Cherry Vanilla, etc THE REAL SCENE! YEAH!"
2,fooled me on this one!,the trailer on u-tube was the catch. my grandson (17 months)loved the happy train picking up passengers and going on its way. I ordered the cd thinking it would have more of the same but found a sequence of dull sketches that left a lot to desire. My grandson ignored it completely at first and now just waits for the train portion which is at the very end of the cd and only last but a minute. I would have liked to ask for a refund but hate to go thru the trouble.
3,A little less than expected,"My 1 yr old son loved the train animation posted on You Tube. So I bought this DVD thinking there would be more of the funny animations. Unfortunately it wasn't as much fun. I must say the animations are great. But do not really tell a 'story' like the train does. At first my son totally rejected this DVD but after watching a couple times, he pays attention. He does not like it but watches it for a while. I won't say this was a waste of money but isn't money's worth either - at least in my case."
3,It didn't meet my expectation,"I had a a Doodle Baby traler from Youtube which my 1-year old daughter liked a lot. However, the rest of stuff didn't impress her, she got bored and didn't watch the DVD completely."
3,It goes on and on and on and on and on...,"I had to read this book in grade twelve...twice! Once for a Christian Ethincs Class and once for English studies on Canadian Literature. It was quite disappointing, taking a long time to build up to a climax that didn't exist...it was more of an anti-climax. The symbolism in the book makes up for the less-than-admirable plot about a boy deciding whether to rebel against his upbringing and allow war and violence into his life."
1,Jump on the Ground & Roll up your Skirts,"It wasn't that bad. Horrible no-disgusting yes. The son produce by all-of-a-sudden-lust has ""improper"" thoughts of his mother-incest is the correct word. The father-James-attempted-in my opionon-to make a whore outta Lenore. Really it is disgusting-I lies. If all cassie Edwards writing is like this, I highly doubt I will ever read another of her books again."
5,Where would the world be without Randy Grim,Extremely haunting story of one man's determination to help as many needy strays as possible. It opens up a world that one never knew existed (or could possibly exist in our civilised world).A must for any rescue group in any part of the world to read. Thank God for Randy Grim.
4,Inspirational story and great person,"I read Randy's story and was both sad and inspired. What a courageous life he leads, and yet, I can relate to his almost obsessive need to rescue these poor, down and out, neglected dogs. I have a rescue dog from a puppy mill named Daisy. She and I have been through a very long journey (and still have a long way to go). Randy's book was an inspiration and gave me encouragement when I first decided to adopt Daisy. His dedication became mine. Just when I needed it.Good book for all you dog lovers out there.By the way, I am cataloging all of Daisy's progress from puppy mill dog to Wonder Dog at http://daisythewonderdog.blogspot.com/"
3,The Dog Rescuer,"Poignant and disturbing if a bit disjointed. More than talking to dogs, Randy Grim understands their needs and has at times puts himself in harm's way to rescue abandoned, feral dogs from warehouses, abandoned apartments and houses, and fields. He has turned his difficulty communicating with humans into a useful, compassionate, even obsessive need to save these dogs. The stories don't link together very well and I'd like more insight and history into Randy himself, but overall, the book leaves you feeling that you want to help, too."
2,Major Disappointment,"Purchased this unit for a long road trip. Right out of the box, it looked like something was off. The colors (with all settings adjusted equally) on the 2 screens looked completely different - one of them looked extremely unnatural. After about 30 minutes of using, the sound became distorted. You could hear the dvd spinning right through the speakers, then it would change to whirring, then chattering. Overall, the package is pretty nice - nice bag, remote (that didn't work that well either), dvd player separate from the screens (I really liked this feature), but the workmanship leaves a lot to be desired. I brought it back to Target a day after we returned from our trip. Will be looking to buy another, probably more expensive player."
4,Still going after almost 2 years...,"Many reviewers say this dies within weeks or months of purchase. I've had mine for about 20 months now or so and it still works like a champ. It has gone on many car trips both short and far. It has taken all the bumps, drops, stepping on, and other punishment that we inflict on it and it keeps chugging along. The only negative we seem to have is that when it is used with headphones there is an annoying high pitched feedback that sometimes comes through the headphones especially when the car is accelerating, but other than that we are pleasantly surprised with this unit."
3,So Far So Good,"So far we are happy. It arrived on time, we knew it would not be the top quality high profile plastic so we were not surprised by how light and flimsy it was. We hooked it up and it worked fine. Slight blue line in one monitor but it went away quickly. Time will tell."
4,"Works well, but cables are a hassle!","I bought the product for my daughter to use in the car. Works well & has a good, clear picture. The only problem I have is that the cables from the dvd player to the monitors come unplugged easily. I would buy this product again."
1,Very bad experience,"We purchased this for our daughter's first birthday and she loved it for about 10 days until the unit stopped working. We sent it back to the manufacturer about 4 weeks ago and still did not hear a thing. I tried calling couple of times, but no answer. Very bad customer service.The unit would not read the CD/DVD.. It just says there is no DVD in there at all. Very bad experience. I sure hope I hear something back from them. I would not recomend the product to anybody."
1,Terrible! Do not buy!,On the second use the buttons stopped working. On the third use the whole thing stopped working. Returned it after using it only three times.
1,Piece of cheap plastic junk - failed after one trip!,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas, thought it would be great for them each to have their own screen and for me to have the controls in the front (passenger) seat. On our first trip with the players, within 5 miles of our house, the bracket holding the strap on one of the screens broke. Thankfully I was able to rig it together with a band-aid. After the trip, I put away the players (my kids only watch movies on long trips) and took them out a week later for a 2 hr trip. One of the players had sound only, no picture. Completely and utterly broke. Thankfully I bought it through Amazon and returned it because it was defective.The screens and player are so cheap, I would never buy again. I'm now on the hunt for a new dual-screen set, or even better, two tablet-style dvd players.DON'T BUY - it is total junk."
2,poor quality!,in simple words.... I used this product for less than a month & now the DvD player doesn't read any DVD..... the screens are good.
5,Works great just what we were looking for,"This is great we were looking for a system where the player is seperate from the monitor,and this one is it. It connects through S-Video, which is a much better contection than a small AV Plug, but you can connect them that ways also. I also like the fact that each monitor is seperate. and one does not wire to the next."
1,Broke 1/2 an hour into 12 hour trip,Arrived missing one mounting strap. Improvised with a long velcro strap from the hardware store (which works far better than the one supplied)1/2 an hour into the trip from Miami to NC my son lightly dropped his closed juice cup on top of the player and it went dead. Could not get it to turn on again. Made emergency stop at Walmart to purchase another 2 screen DVD somewhere in Georgia to save our sanity and theirs.
2,Not suitable for all ages,"I thought the product itself worked fine. However, we have one child and do not particularly want to watch her baby videos at all times. We ended up returning this product because it would only play one movie at a time. Also, this one required that you have each screen and the player connected to power. If two people watch it it would require that 3 power sources be available. There were wires all over the place which is not very safe with an infant, or any other child for that matter.We tested it and although the picture quality was fine, it was not good enough to keep based on the above reasons."
5,Great way to entertain grandchildren in the car,"I purchased one of these for myself and it worked super, the grandchildren were so happy in the back seat on a long drive! Worked so well that I purchased one for our daughter to have in her van!!"
2,So Disappointed,"I have only written one other review ever, but I wanted to post this. I read all the reviews on the Axion and I felt like it was about 50~50 chance that it was good, but it was a good price. I felt like I had to buy a really expensive Dual DVD player before I got to more positive reviews. We used the DVD player on one trip up to Maryland and it worked great. Then on the ride home it stopped working right in the middle of a movie. I pulled over and tried to replug in the wires (in case something came loose), but not such luck. Thankfully, Amazon replaced it. (unfortunately with the same DVD player) Hopefully this one will have a longer life. I honestly think Amazon shouldn't offer this system to its customers."
5,Works great!,"This product saved our trip to FL. The screens look great.If you are going on a long drive with kids, it is worth the money."
1,Great start...lousy finish,"First the good news......We ordered this product for a six hour car ride. It arrived on time and worked like a dream. Great picture quality and really loved the fact that the actual player was sperate from the monitors. It made changeing DVDs much easier.Now the bad news....On our ride back home, the player stopped working. Just stopped. No bumps in the road to jog anything loose, no power problems, no children handling it...it just stopped, never to start again."
4,Great product for the price!,"I researched these for awhile and came to this one because of price, Its not a very high quality unit, the displays case seem cheap, but its just an LCD in a plastic box. It works great, simple to hook-up and setup in the car. We have 2 cars and move it from one to the other fairly quikly. The carry case it comes with is great to keep all the cables and charges together, The picture quality is very good and so is the sound, each display has a volume control and a plug for headphones. One good feature is the ability to skip thru scenes to get back to where the kids left the movie when we stop the car to take a break. Over-all I would recommend this unit highly, but I've only had it for 3 months, so far so good.JP"
1,Worked one time!,"I bought it for my wifes car. She hooked it all up and played one movie and then tried to load another movie and it cam up no disc. She and I tried several movies after that and it worked off an on, more off than on. I did discover if you turned the whole unit off that it would read the next movie more readly than the way it was suppose to properly work. I have sent it back and I'm going to try it again. I'll let you know how that one goes!!"
3,Great sound too bad both screens weren't working correctly,First time we hooked it up great! Second time the second screen would only show black and white. Think we got a defective unit had to return...
4,Go for it,"I've never owned one of these before so I have nothing really to compare it to, but we just took it on a short family trip (2.5 hours one way) and we loved it! It's easy to set up and easy to use. The picture and sound quality are both good. I do wish it had batteries so you didn't have to start the movie over every time the car was turned off, although on long trips you don't turn if off all that often. We borrowed a portable DVD system (some walmart brand) from my sister before we bought this one and this one feels much sturdier and the sound and picture quality were much better. I also really liked the carrying case is came with. Over all a great product!"
4,Excellent READING!!!!!!!!!!,"The book was recommended by a very good source.Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. If really ""flowed"". The author made reading this book seem as if you were watching a movie. You could picture every characters physical make up, their emotions and every detail in your mind. The only thing that was missing were the refreshments.This book will definitely take you away and draw you in at the same time.I am looking forward to more books from this up and coming author."
5,Good History; worthy entertainment,"In an interesting turnabout, the Revolutionary War is seen through the eyes of a British family to whom an American prisoner of war has been entrusted. Technically the young prisoner is in Uncle Laurence's custody, but the children soon forge a forbidden friendship with him after he nearly dies in an attempted escape. He becomes the Reb and they, his Redcoats. But when they learn of some events leading to his coming to Europe, even Uncle Laurence, embittered by the unjust death of a friend in America, thaws toward him-but this doesn't stop the Reb from scheming to escape. Constance Savery deftly weaves themes of trust and forgiveness into an interesting plot with likeable characters."
5,beautiful solo guitar,"This album has something for everyone. It is well recorded, and the playing is excellent."
5,Joanie's still POSITIVELY THE MOST!!!,"I own the vinyl version of this album, and it's still as vibrant as it was when first released in 1960. Tommy Oliver and Marty Paich each deserve gold stars for their superb arrangements!!!"
5,Very helpful.,"i read this book, and it was very helpful. i have inconince and now i finaly understand why I can't control going poo in my pants. i highly reccommennd this book for anyone who also poos and stuf. Good book."
1,Please don't waste your money!,"This was 18 dollars down the toilet. I don't know what are the proper words to describe this, so I'll just say ""this book sucks"", trust me , you can learn more from youtube videos than from this book. It is very begginer, but I mean like begginer guitar Mel Bay grade one for kids book, begginer for Reggae guitar also. The cd recorded at poor volume gives you the sample tracks but it doesn't have a single play along in it. Let me put it this way, the only nice thing about this book is the colorful cover, I am thinking of ripping the cover apart and donating the book to my local library."
5,An excellent history of the Plymouth settlers.,"In doing research on my own ancestor who was a passanger on the Mayflower and one of the original Pilgrims, I have used over 50 books. This one is by far the best. Very readable, this book provides an excellent narative of many of the events of the first 70 years at Plymouth, and detailed descriptions of many of the Pilgrims. For anyone interested in this era, this book is a must."
5,Fantastic Research Information,My husband & I are both descended from The Mayflower - He from William Brewster & Stephen Hopkins and I from William Bradford. This book has added so much information for our Genealogy. I cannot tell you how many times I have used it to add information to our family history file. It has many years of use.
4,Plymouth Colony and Mayflower Families,"Great information, just not as much information as I would have liked regarding certain family members which is why I bought the books to begin with."
2,This collection ain't right.,"It's obvious to true fans that those weren't the real artists singing on this album. The people singing were similar, but not convincing. Now unless it's just my computer (which I doubt very seriously that it is), I'd say this company was trying to get over on us."
4,Gittler is a better writer than he is a photographer!,"If you're expecting a coffee table book filled with pretty pictures of porn stars, DO NOT buy this book. If you want a well written, engaging, painfully honest account of the porn industry, this is a must read. I really enjoyed this book greatly. I wished it had a few more pictures to correspond with the story though. Still, one of my favorites."
2,Flimsy yet intriguing,"First of all, this is not a coffee table book. It is more like an extended disjointed expose (w/somber pictures) by a Details magazine writer. Although I feel that the latter is true, the subject matter is inherently interesting and it is somewhat cool to experience vicariously the forays of an obviously sexually motivated (as opposed to literary or artistically motivated) man into this secluded subculture."
1,Promises More Than It Delivers,"I was highly anticipating a quality book on a fascinating subject that hasn't been properly chronicled yet. Unfortunately, it still hasn't been. The paper-thin moralizing of the poorly written text combined with okay-but-nothing-more black & white photograpy results in a book that promises more than it delivers."
1,TERRIBLE AND STUPID BOOK,"This book just seems very self-serving to Ian Gittler. It seems that this book is a case of I will go and have wild fun and than write about how bad it is. He had wild sex with one of the hot porn stars of the moment who had some bad problems with life in general and the porn business as a whole but he does not care because you get wild monkey sex with a star. She kills herself and he feels bad.I cannot think of anyone that would keep this book out for guest to see or your children. Well maybe if you are a swinger. The pictures are tactfully done. You may not think so if you do not like nudity or think that it should not be in a book. Let me state that I have no problem with nudity or the porn business as a whole but this book is trash. And it is not because of the pictures or the subject of the book. It is because of the written commentary. I have to give this review 1 star only because of the nudity, instead of the zero stars it deserves."
4,This book was a surprize for me its great!!!,I was surprised at how interesting as well as entertaining this book was I feel sorry for life these people seem to lead but this is an excellent book.
1,Pseudo-Sensitive Yet Ingrayiatingly Macho,"Where does Gittler get off (well, we know THAT part after the book) thinking he can possibly understand and therefore report on such a complex industry. The photographs are standard fare, nothing beautiful and nothing provocative. His text neither adds nor detracts, I have read saucier and more sensitive exploits in Rolling Stone."
2,"Good read, but bad photos.","If you are looking for something to read about the porn industry and the difficult lives that are led by its members, then look no further. This books gives us some insight into a world that most of us will never know. And for that reason alone, the book is a decent read. However, that being said, i would not recommend buying this book. Borrow a friends or go find it at an adult bookstore and browse through it. That is the only way it will be worth your money (by not spending any that is). The photos are pretty boring, and they look like they were done by someone without a lot of photo experience. I feel like i could have done better myself with a digital camera. And the subjects themselves are not all that fun to look at or even attractive. This is not the story of some porn star you love. This is the story of some porn star you may not have seen before, and may not care to see again. In plain english, THIS IS NOT AN EROTIC BOOK."
4,Humanizing erotic film stars provides memorable images,"Ian Gittler delves into the world of XXX like few have before him. He humanizes the pornographic film business while, for the most part, remaining an outsider. The photos add greatly to the drama which unfolds in Gittler's vignettes. The scene in which star Debi Diamond demands to be slammed into a wall is memorable; her revelation that her grandmother's pearls were destroyed in the process is haunting. The book could have used much more written text. For a guy who spent nearly a decade writing and researching this book, it should have been longer. But what is on the pages is unforgettable."
2,A disapointment by the end...,"I was somewhat disapointed with Ian Gittler's ""Pornstar"". Some of the photographs were interesting, but most were cheezy! I felt that Gittler's vision of his book was a good one, but somewhere along the line, Gittler lost his direction. What started out to be a look into the minds of these ""stars"" turned out to be a book of Gittler's own self discovery. Gittler should have changed this book to be an autobiography of himself, because that is how it ended up."
3,I wouldn't want this judge on my jury.,"This was a sad and interesting book with attention to a lot of small details, but I came away with a sense that the author finds his subjects to be less than human and worthy of little or no respect. There is no sense of empathy here; in fact, there are no feelings at all. In the end, I viewed the author as he viewed his subjects."
5,a model for us all,"Clarina Nichols was one of the nation's most amazing women of the Civil War Era--or any era. Any of the hats that she wore--crusading newspaper editor in Vermont, temperance lecturer and political activist in four states, pioneer abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor in ""Bleeding Kansas,"" and defender of abused women--would be more than a lifetime of work for most people. Diane Eickhoff's superbly researched and presented biography Revolutionary Heart: The Life of Clarina Nichols And the Pioneering Crusade for Women's Rights shows us how far we have come in 150 years--largely due to the heroic efforts of women such as Nichols and Eickhoff herself!"
5,for the intellectual,"most complicated pirkey avot yet, but excellent. Get your copy while you can-Learn to be a real mentch. gut luch"
4,nice and sturdy,A nice silverware storage box. It accomidated my 7 piece service for 12 along with the hostess set.Stores easily in closet or where ever space is an issue
5,Perfect for a large set of flatware!,"I ordered this flatware chest after doing much research online, and I am very pleased with it. It arrived in just a few days, was well packaged, and is perfect! I have a 16 piece flatware set, and it holds everything, plus a few of the serving pieces as well. Great value and quality!"
4,Good Product,"I have had this shower curtain for years now. Love it, as it allows light in through the plastic which is great if you have a small bathroom. If necessary, it will wash up very well and rehung to dry."
2,Not the color offered!,This curtain is a pale yellow or cream. Definitely not a beige. Beige is tan or light brown. Might be a good curtain - don't know because I didn't open it.
5,Django Reinhardt collection 1934-1942 recordings,"This is a very good CD. In addition to top class playing by Jango Reinhardt there are many pieces featuring excellent solo and duet work by Stephane Grappelly on violin. There is rhythm, drive and freshness to the pieces included. An altogether fine addition to a tradional jazz library!"
3,Terrorism Today,"Informative, but sorely needing some editing and certainly updating.Distracted by too many spelling and grammatical errors.Topics were carelessly composed and rambling. In light of today's world events; glaring omissions of factual content is evident.Couldn't help feeling that the authors were rushing to get some details published as quickly as possible.Examinations, and study questions, also seemed to overlook important facts, yet brought up some useless points that had little to do with the expressed purpose of the subject matter.I can only give credit to the authors for attempting to outline an overwhelming historical source of evidence highlighting the facts dealing with the International world of Terrorism. I am looking forward to a serious effort in updating this textbook, and a better understanding of the historical significance (past and present) behind the problems facing all nations suffering from threats of terrorism."
2,Poorly written and documented,"I purchased this book as required for a graduate class. I found it to be rambling and filled with personal opinion and undocumented exposition. The authors appear to be very experienced, but used this forum to tell their own stories, rather than to provide a scholarly work that could be relied upon for accuracy and fact."
2,Poorly Written,"This textbook has the focus you expect from a high school research paper. The only difference is that the authors of Terrorism Today use elevated language and esoteric, arcane references, so uncovering any points in this book is extremely laborious at best. Most of it is nothing more than a series of polysyllabic ramblings. One of the most upsetting aspects of it is that the authors make outrageous claims about the motives and psyches of various groups, but they don't back up their claims, and they're obviously not psychologists. I generously gave it two stars because it does contain well hidden bits of information here and there; good luck finding them."
2,Very small and the face is ugly.,"I bought this as a baptism gift for a friend's baby. I am usually impressed with the Gund brand but not this time. This little lamb is very small and the face looks like a possum (sp). Not charming at all. The ""Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep"" recording, which plays when you press the tummy is sweet but overall this toy looks cheap and unfortunately unattractive."
4,Actually pretty clever,"For me, this is a clever movie, subtle and dry, hard to believe it's German. It is for all those people who have seen all the deep French films about sex. The story concerns a woman who wants to make a film about sex which is not pornographic but explicit, trying to reveal the 'secret' of sex. Really, a fitting commentary. Can't say anything more without ruining it."
1,Weak film at making a film...,I was truly disappointed after watching this film. It's a disjointed film about making a film which never materializes. Not worth more than $7. Save your money!
1,For adults Only,"This movie should be rated at the least, NC-17, it has explicit sex scenes, that border on triple X.My own personal opinion, the movie was hard to follow, vague at best in regards to an actual plot. And beyond boring."
3,"Elbridge A. Stuart, founder of Carnation Company","I am using this as a support book for my genealogy of my grandfather who worked for E.A. Stuart, and from this I have been able to contact the Carnation Co. and give them old photos they do not have."
3,Broke after less than a month,"My 15 month old daughter LOVES this book. She always brings it to me to read and says ""bye bye moon"" at the end. But within a month after purchase the light stopped working. When I pulled the back panel off to change the batteries they were all floating around inside and the battery connections were broken off on both sides. They were made of a thin plastic with no reinforcement. I'd hoped she wouldn't noticed that the light doesn't come on anymore, but she keeps touching the moon when I read to get me to turn it on. I don't think I'll get another one."
4,Great bedtime book,"We read this book to our 7 month old every night and he loves it. He could be in the worst of moods but once I push the moons face and start the story he immediately calms down and starts smiling. We have been reading this book to him since he was 1 month old. He loves the book and he loves looking at the light that the moons face gives off.Problems to Note:This is actually the second time buying this book because the first book broke within 3 months. The lights timer stopped working and, while reading the book, the moons face had to be held the entire time. Hopefully this second book will last longer than the first. If not, I will probably change my review from a four to something lower. If it weren't for this problem I would definitely have given this book a 5 star rating."
2,Leaking batteries---didn't work,"I bought this book quite a long time ago for my (then) two-year-old because of developing fears of the dark. When it arrived, the batteries were not only dead, but leaking into the compartment. So, of course, the ""moon"" did not work.I immediately looked for more batteries, but found them to cost as much as the book itself. I boxed it back up with the intention of sending it back to Amazon, but never got around to it. (I have four children.) Recently, I re-opened the book and gave it to my (now) three-year-old, but she's not interested.Guess I will just buy the batteries and try it with my one-year-old. I just hope it works because of the leaking batteries. Make sure you check the batteries when you get this item!!!"
4,Very Cute Book,My 2 yr old daughter loves to take this book to bed with her. We've had it for a couple of months and have not had to replace the battery yet. Would also make a nice gift.
3,good night book,"We love this book,in fact we have had two. The light isn't very durable one push in and the batteries don't last long."
2,Problems with light!!!!!,"I too have had this light quit on me several times. The first time I got a free replacement from the company. This time I think I'm just going to look for another book with a similar feature (perhaps by a different publisher?) My 3 1/2 yr old daughter does love the friendly moon face and gentle story, I just hate when it stops working and she's disappointed! If it was a longer lasting product I'd give it 5 stars, as it really helps keep my daughter feeling safer at night. Re: the review about the story being an ad for the book itself, that's kind of true! And I also thought about the mirror in the mirror type weird experience. But in a way I don't mind that it's selling itself, because in a way I was trying to sell it to my daughter as a sleep aid too.Anyway, those who have bought this and had no problems with the light, you're very lucky!!"
1,Light doesn't work,That is the second time I buy this book and the light doesn't work. Very frustrating.
1,Lame but could have been a cute book,"I was disappointed with this book because I don't like reading a book that is about the book you are reading. Not even half way threw the book the little boy reaches for ""The Moon In My Room"" book and the rest of this book is about the book itself and how great it is. Well it could have been great if it wasn't an advertisement for itself."
1,Horrible condition of book,"I have purchased used books for my son on amazon all the time. He loves to read so we have a vast collection of used books. And yes, I know that used books are not in perfect condition. But this book was awful. It looked like someone had vomited in a couple of pages and stuck them together. It was disgusting. Even my husband thought it was gross. I cannot believe someone would actually sell this book. There was crusty film all over the whole book. Seriously?! Gross!!!!!"
1,Disatisfied,(The moon in my room night light book) The book came to me unwrapped with a slight damage to the cover and the night light dont work.shouldnt be!.
5,"Cute Book, Excellent Customer Service","We also had a book that quit working after about a week...we replaced the FOUR batteries, only to find it was the book, not the batteries that needed to be replaced. I contacted the publisher, and we were sent a free replacement. We didn't even have to pay for shipping...customer service such as this is a rare find these days. The new book works perfectly so far. My son loves to read this every night before he goes to bed."
3,Cute but not great story,"The story is ABOUT the book. Like ""My favorite book is about the moon"" and it shows a realistic image of the book being carried by the little boy. I find it weird, sort of a mirror in a mirror in a mirror type of existential issue. The moon is cute and my daughter loves to make it light up. But I wish the plot was about the MOON not the book itself."
3,Over long drivel,"It's hard to recognise Daryl Hannah, there's so much plastic surgery there to be able to pretend that it was a total stranger.The whole idea was totally ridiculous, I can't say any more than that."
1,For retired people only,"Well, I was expecting a dynamic dance lessons. Instead, two 50+ (or 60+ ?) instructors dance in a slow motion. If you a retired person, this DVD is perfect for you, otherwise it's a complete waste on money."
2,romance of a plain man,"too wordy, didn't even get thru one fourth of the book and then I just deleted it from my kindle"
3,BRIAN BORU,"If, I'm not mistaken, I believe it was the king, Brian Boru, who was given credit for uniting the ancient Irish. The ancient shrill of the Irish pipe is almost surreal to the human ear, but too much of it can become irritating.The recording of this music seems to lack clarity and at times, even the speaker system in my car shivered from the poor quality of these sounds.If, Brian Boru is credited for uniting the Irish, I fear that too much of this CD will ""dis-unite"" them.Sorry, I was not overly pleased with this CD."
5,New York City Magic From the 1950s,"This is a book that definitely should come back in print!My favorite book as a middle-schooler, it introduced me to fantasy for children in a me (to me) truly exotic location--New York City. How exciting it is to remember Merlin the black cat, who leads young Jill and and her brother Ronnie on magical adventures in Central Park, in a medieval dragon-""infested"" castle, among the constellations, with Indian head pennies come to life, and much more. And it's funny too!"
4,Imagination Piqued,"I took this out of the library when I was about 9 or 10. Had to return it before I was through reading it. However, it piqued my imagination so much that in my late 30s I sought it out at the library and read the whole thing. It enchanted me as much then as it did when I was a child. For over 50 years I have thought of the 13th of the month as a special time and wish that I could rejoin the world where the Wallabys reigned. When I discovered that my local library had ""purged"" it, I regretted that I had not reported the book as ""lost"" when I had the chance and added it to my collection. I do wish they would reprint it with the original illustrations."
1,Do not buy this for use with a PC,"I bought this as a 2nd gaming monitor for the PC (my first was the Kreissen 30"" version) and was sorely disappointed.Although the screen has a native resolution of 1280 x 768 pixels it does not appear that the internal circuitry supports it. In fact the manual actually tells you to set your PC settings at 1024 x768. This was confirmed when no matter what I tried, I could not get it to display either through the DVI or VGA connector at 1280 x768.In contrast the 30"" version of the Kreisen which I also have worked flawlessly at this resolution.I ended up returning it and exchanging it for the 30"" Kresisen which is a really good value.If you are buying this for use as a TV only this review may not apply, but if you are planning on using it with a PC pass on this one."
5,"Orange Tabby Tested, Orange Tabby Approved.","I bought this TV based on the great reviews it received. Well, here is how great it is. I took the TV out of the huge box it arrived in and set it on the stand. I walked over to my bed to get the cables for it. I looked over at the TV and my wacky Orange tabby cat was sitting in front of it in the jumping position. I began walking over toward him as he leaped forward to try to jump on it. He grabbed the top of it with his paws wrapped over the top. When he grabbed it, the whole thing fell forward and it hit hardwood floor and bounced. I thought, ""Oh crap, my new TV is broken."" I hooked it up to check it and BAM - it worked like a charm. That was a week or so ago and it is still going strong. Great sound, great picture - high quality. Execellent. Thanks Kreisen."

5,WHERE THE HEART IS,ONE OF ELIZABETHS LOWELLS BEST. A GREAT LOVE STORY. LOVED THE CAT NAMED NUDGE AND THE BOA NAMED SQUEEZE. I WOULD TAKE THAT LITTLE BOT ANYTIME. THEY SHOULD KICK HIS MOTHERT TO THE CURB
4,Great Alphonse Mouzon album!!!!,"""Back To Jazz"" is a very good album ala Mouzon! Sonny Rollins's ""St.Thomas"" is interesting arranged. It sounds a little Hawaiin influenced to my ears. ""The Next Time We Love"" is one of the greatest songs and the absolute killer cut on that Cd. The band works so great on that tune and Jeff Daniel does a wonderful piano solo. Alphonse's drum sound is incredible and his playing is awesome as usual. Nice version of Mouzon's classic ""Poobli"". On ""Peace on Earth"" Mouzon's two sons Jean-Pierre and Alphonse-Philippe sing. The next killer cut is ""Just Because of you"" which has Alphonse doing ultra-tight grooves and fills. Just get it and you will hear...."
1,"Original Artists, Not Original Singles,","Original Artists, but many of the songs are rerecorded,not the original version, Watch Out, Many Of these compilationare rerecorded versions by the original artists."
5,Get these while you still can,They are a STEAL for $20.00. They are very comfortable and with a style that is endless...you can't go wrong. I got a pair in brown and one in black. Can't have too much of a good thing.
4,Nice Shoe!!!,"Very nice shoe, true to size. Comfortable, however, do not wear for long walks (more than 1 mile). Would definitely recommend to others."
3,"The lyrics ruin it, but the music is excellent!","This is unquestionably some of the coolest and most original music that I've ever heard in my life. (So original, in fact, that I can't think of anything comparable - except to say that it's jazz-fusion-rock with a heavy emphasis on the jazz element...steps beyond The Graham Bond Organization.) At times this music is breathtaking. As for the lyrics, though, as one can tell from the song titles, yes, they're rather occult/new age-oriented...and...well...one often wishes that these were instrumental albums!I do have to agree with the one reviewer and say that ""Moving Towards the Light"" and ""Time to Die"" are incredible works!"
4,Excellent album,"These two albums are very different from the strongly Ray Charles-influenced sound of Bond's mid-'60s recordings with the Graham Bond Organisation, closer to a sort of progressive jazz-rock, but more restrained than that suggests. Some people dislike these records simply because they are different from the GBO, and some dislike them because of the occult orientation of the lyrics (based on Bond's study of the work of Aleister Crowley, whose ""Book of the Law"" describes the star on the front cover of ""We Put Our Magick On You"": ""The Five Pointed Star, with a Circle in the Middle, & the circle is Red""). Granted, the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram is not exactly hit-parade material, but the album is still very strong musically and is worth hearing. There's nothing else quite like it."
5,Still Mighty After All of These Years,Graham Bond was one of the most influential artists of the 60s and early 70s. His untimely death in 1974 ended what would have been the path of a legend.This recording demonstrates his devotion to Magick and to his father Aleister Crowley. This is REAL new age music. It is powerful. I highly recommend this recording to any who practice Thelemic Magick.Bond was the very best at what he did. Thanks to this recent reissue he will now live forever.

1,spooky? maybe. goofy? definitely,"being the upstanding man of integrity that i am, it would be blasphemous for me to hold someone's beliefs against them. however, when those beliefs lead to tripe like this from more-famous-for-whom-he-played-with-oh-and-by-the-way-he's-EEEEVVVIIIILLLLL graham bond, it behooves me to speak up. this is as far from bond's better-than-perfunctory early blues work as california is from london. its occultic mumbo-jumbo mixed with healthy doses of hippie jazz and throw-it-at-the-wall, maybe-it'll-stick nonsense. i wanted to be spooked out by this. instead i wasted a good chunk o change. its not even silly enough to laugh at. DISAPPOINTMENT..."
3,Cheaper From Source,This product retails at $799.99 ($800) from Marantz. I don't know why it costs so much here.
2,One of the slowest Fantasy novels ever...,"I felt this book never took off. The characters were shallow and uninteresting. The underlying message was good, but the way he went about it was bad. The motivations for a lot of the characters were questionable. The ending was too contrived. Jilseponie didn't come across as a hero. The solution was basically just dropped in her lap. Very little action."
2,The POV jumping was jarring.,"Let me start off by saying that I am huge RA Salvatore fan, so I decided to read some of his other works. I was very disappointed in this story. After awhile, I just didn't care about the plot, but I continued to read hoping it would get better. It was difficult, until the very end, to determine who the main character was (Spoiler Alert: It's Pony). The author jumped randomly from one person's point of view to another to the point where it was jarring. He introduced new characters frequently all throughout the book and their point of view, which didn't bring anything to the story and subsequently didn't hear from them again. It was also difficult to care about any one character. With the exception of a few minor characters, which I liked more than the main character, most descriptions were at a surface level. I just expected a more interesting story and characters that a reader would care about."
5,A Great Read!,"After the losses in the last book it was hard to see where this tale was headed. R. A. Salvatore has broken new ground and pushed this already character rich world a little farther. I must admit for the previous readers of the series that Brother Francis ( as hard as this may seem ) somewhat steals the show. The novel itself takes the reader into some dark areas where one must judge the STRONG decree of the Abelican church to preserve itself vs. the ""Common"" man's idealistic beliefs. One can even say this conflict is even reflected in the world of his elves as well. Salvatore backs up all points of view with very powerful reasons for all of their methods. I honestly can say once you pick this book up, you may wish to cancel any plans you may have. You won't want to put it down till you finish!"
2,Salvatore has gotten off track,"I have bought and read most of the demonwar series. Some was good, but it went rapidly downhill after Elbryan died. The plot became convoluted, hard to understand , and Jilsiponie became a character who was driven by the plot, not part of it. As I have often said about Movies, I hate it when stupidity is necessary for the story to continue. I believe that entire story could have been well told in two books, and without the stupidity, could have been resolved much quicker. Some books let you know how it will finish, and you don't care, because the book is good. This series let you know how it would finish, so I didn't care to plow through it to read it to the end. Let's get back to Drizzt!"
5,Riveting,"This is one of Salvatore's greatest books to date. He truly put his soul into this work , and you truly feel the pain of Jilseponie as she tries to get over Elbryan the Nightbird's death. A lot of loose ends are tied up in this book (although they are opened again in Asendance), and it makes you feel pretty content to see that everything just might work out for the best."
4,Definitely not his best ... but that's not saying much!,"I found Mortalis to be a reasonably good Salvatore book, and defintely not a deterrent for reading the next Demon Wars saga. My complaint is that the entire thing seemed awfully predictable. Plot lines were creative and exciting, but ultimately far from the mysterious ""what will happen next"" story-lines we're used to seeing from Salvatore. I get the feeling that he is setting up his world of Honce-the-Bear for a great series of books in his second Demon Wars saga, which makes Mortalis more of a transistion than a heart-thumping thriller. However, the amount of hate Salvatore inspires for his evil (and not so evil) characters as well as the love he inspires for the good ones will keep me reading as he churns out the next few books. My recommendation of the Demon Wars saga as a whole is 5 big stars!"
3,Somewhat slow...,"The first three books in this series were incredible, and I really enjoyed the read. This being the 4th book, really started to slow things down. The plot was not that interesting and it seemed more as if Salvatore was writing to continue the series. The books lacked his usual grander intertwining scheme. Although the book is still well written as is the norm for Salvatore, it definitely is not his best. The entire series is still worth the read, but it does get a little drawn out."
4,Coyote Steals The Blanket,"A greedy coyote thinks that he owns everything. One day he comes across these beautiful blankets but before a little bird had warned him not to talk them, but the greedy coyote took them anyway. The rock chased him all over and there was no way that he could stop it, unless he returned the blanket. I like this book because it teaches a wonderful lesson that I believe all children should learn, that you should not take what is not yours. I think the author did a great job getting that lesson across in a simple enough fashion that young children can understand."
3,The Periplus Of The Erythraean Sea A review,1. There are problems with the print and quality of paper used. Some pages have very light print barely visible. I bought the book for its invaluable information on sea trade flourishing on the Indian subcontinent at the turn of the 1st century.2. There is an invaluable map in the older editions . Though it is listed in the index it is missing from the copy I received. I would be grateful if it can be mailed.
5,Thank You Laurel Burch!,"I had admired Laurel Burch and her work for over 20 years. It wasn't until I went to her web site that I realized she had passed away 2 years ago. I was very saddened, she was such a wonderful, colorful, creative person and artist. It is such a great loss to us all.But, we have her legacy of amazing work to enjoy, this book in perticular. If you love cats or just love color, this book will bring you great pleasure. This beautiful hardbound book is full of examples of her work, and the designs, wow! Even if you aren't an artist, this book would be a keepsake for your visitors to enjoy. Talk about a fabulous ""coffee table"" book.Don't hesitate to make this purchase, and get to know more about her, go to her web site. Learn of her amazing strength battling her life long health problems."
4,Montclair homecoming,"Very nicely written, enjoyed it very much. Absolutely loved the other 14 books. I hated to see the books end."
2,stop please,I agree with the first two reviewers. The downfall in her books came when she started putting more than one bride in a book. I'm just sorry she didn't want to finish the series with a good book. Mabey she just got bored. Too bad.
5,Really Pulls It All Together,"I have done a lot of online research regarding APS. While most sites have nice information, it is usually only a page or two, highlighting bits and pieces. This book really pulls it all together, clearly linking symptoms to help define the ""big picture"" - both historical and forward looking. It is also in an easy to read format that covers a good amount of information without being overwhelming. Nice credibility with the Foreword by Dr. Hughes and Dr. Roubey. This is a must have for APS patients and family!"
4,Easy reading,"This book is easy reading and informative. Although I have done my own research on APS, it is nice to have a small book with some basic information. The personal stories are helpful. I wish there was a more detailed book out there that went into more detail about autoimmune disorders. Overall, I would recommend it."
1,"lack of support, proprietary USB cable make this useless for me","my fault for losing the USB cable, but Lubix does nothing to assist in finding a new one. the cable is NOT a standard USB as the small connector is proprietary. I have searched the manual, their website and generally on the internet, but cannot find support contact info, replacement part info or anything that would help me replace the cable.based on this I give the headset 1 star, though the sound wasn't bad while I could use them they are now garbage I must dispose of just because I cannot replace the cable.I would suggest to anyone purchasing online to check for support information PRIOR to purchasing. If you cannot contact the manufacturer you may regret your purchase in the future.I'll be throwing these away now as I cannot charge them"
1,cheap tape,Cheap tape and weak magnetic tip. it's too thin to use if you need to measure something out far from your reach.
4,Rollicking good fun,"A post 911 antitode to the blues: happy tunes throughout with standout numbers by the entire ensemble, most noteably a reworking of When You're Smiling by Julie Michels, and a standard sounding original tune called Who Wouldn't Care For You by charming songbird Alex Pangman. Leader Bee is right on target with this uber uplifting project, and to further diversify the record employs the sultry Lyne Tremblay to purr the French version of Sing Sing Sing. An enjoyable set of bubbley tunes played by some top flight Canadian musicians including Richard Underhill and Peter Appleyard."
2,Racist!!!,"I guess the Quebecois are a few decades behind on the portrayal of minorities. This otherwise charming video has Annie Brocoli in Chineee makeup going ""Ching-chong, bing bong"" and then dressed up as a lazy Mexican scientist, snoring away and having to be awoken to talk in a drawl, and finally, in blackface as an African with bones in her hair going, ""Ooga booga, ooga booga."" Incroyable."
4,.Satisfied,"The thermocouple is exactly what I had ordered. It would be a much better fit if it were 1/4"" longer but it does work so I am happy."
1,Swiss tech made in china,I just this one.It really doesnt cut.Its called swiss tech to make you think its a high quality swiss made clip.Its made in china and the quality is worse then all my 3 usd clipsfrom super markets.
4,Ultar nail clippers,"The Swiss tech is a little bulky for a nail clipper, but I have found some the added features useful. Rather trhan keeping it in the bathrrom, I have it on my desk and it tends to come in handy."
1,Tight teeth: fuggedaboutit,"This is fluffled floss, much thicker than even standard floss. The idea is that when you pull it, it tightens and gets thinner. The reality is that it constantly gets stuck in between tight teeth, in my case my back molars. Even the old trick knotting the floss to try to get out the stuck bits wouldn't work. I boughtOral-B Satinfloss Dental Floss, Mint 55 yardsto get out the stuck bits of the Ultra Floss and in the process discovered my new favorite floss."
2,Not for all teeth,"It's a pretty tight fit between most of my teeth and because of this fact I did not have a good experience with Oral B Super Floss. This product is noticeably thicker than any other floss I've used and is not a great choice for people who lack space between their teeth. Additionally, the floss has poor durability, thus far I've needed two pieces of floss to get though my whole mouth because the first piece routinely breaks. I can understand making wider floss, that's probably much better for some people even if I'm not one of them...but floss that breaks? That seems like if violates a fundamental rule taught in floss manufacturing 101."
1,Disapointed,I guess I didnt realize 5 Simple Steps meant that this DVD was also so short in its content. Pretty much know and have used all that was discussed in the DVD at the basic level but the content also seemed over simplified. More targeted to the very beginning dressage rider and DVD production quality was average at best. Not what I had expected from the earlier DVD reviews. Okay effort but in my opinion did not get anything out of it and is not for the intermediate or advance dressage rider unless you need a complete refresher course on how to use your seat.
2,New stereo recordings,"Except for Why, The Wayward Wind and Baby, I'm Yours the rest are new recordings. Fortunately for me the song I purchased it for was the original recording. I wish products would put this new recording information in large print instead of the tiny stuff."
2,Ultimate documentary colllection,"The advertising for this product is a bit misleading. Actually, most everything on the disks is documentary or US military training films. Very few movies as in ""Dramas."" I was kind of disappointed. When I hear ""movie"" I personally think of entertainment with actors, actresses, plot, story, dramatic presentation not narrated pictures of bombed out buildings and endless air and ship attack footage. I like that stuff too, but if I want a documentary I'll buy one that is advertised as such."
2,Not Durable,"The bag ripped open after a month's use. Might be OK for a youth league with smaller EQ, but will not stand up to regular use in a select league setting. VERY DISAPPOINTED."
2,poor quality,Iten ripped after one week of use. I have returned it and i am waiting credit. Please advise when credit is issued.
2,Sturdy but overpriced,It's a sturdy cable but not worth the money. You can get the same quality for 95% less.
1,Costly,"Both C-net and consumer reports .org have independently verified that there is no visible difference between the ""spiffed up"" cables, from monster, and the regular one's, from any other brand. A computer may be able to detect a difference but, the last time I checked my computer does not watch TV."
4,Another Diana Gabaldon read,"I bought this book specifically to read the D. Gabaldon chapter, but found that I enjoyed the entire book. The chapter Diana Gabaldon wrote with her son was a very enjoyable short story. I would recommend this book as a light read - especially for women with sons."
3,Better than the Last,I like this better than Echoes. Despite the fact that Liam is very immmature but the story explains factors behind why he that way. But I enjoyed the love story and the different obstacles that they endured. The ending is typical but you will end up liking it anyway. Maybe Miracle will be better.
2,Same story different characters,"I have been reading Danielle Steel for a long time, and it seems to me lately I can guess the plot and the ending long before I get there. Her books are starting to copy themselves, same thing different setting. I really had a hard time getting through this one because she kept repeating herself when talking about Sasha's feelings, the book could've been a lot shorter if she didn't write the same thing over and over. I would not recommend this one."
2,Not her very best indeed,"I read the book , i lived through it, but I admit that danielle could turn very shallow in her writing style she is repeating again & again using boring details.Characters are so undetermined in their lives especially for Liam , he got on my nerves through the whole reading.If you like steels novel just omit this from your list or else your disappointment is big."
4,Impossible,"Danielle Steel writes another romantic story this time about an aristocrat art dealer named Sasha who is 49 years old and falls in love with one of her artists who is 9 years younger. The relationship was unexpected and came at a time right after Sasha's husband Arthur passed away while she was still mourning his death like a recluse.Liam is 40 years old and is separated from his wife and children. He is gorgeous and full of life, although at times is out of control. Sasha knows that the relationship is impossible due to the many differences, but both are truly in love and they try to make it work. The story is passionate and captivating however the storyline keeps repeating over and over."
1,Repetitive!!!,"This would probably be a great book to read if you are in the habit of reading a few pages here and there and easily forget what is going on. To read it a few chapters at a time is almost torture. This book could have easily have been 50 pages if we weren't reminded every paragraph that Sasha is 9 years older than Liam and he is a wacky artist and his family pushed him away and he can't be controlled and she is so very successful...blah, blah, blah. Historically, I have really enjoyed Danielle Steele's books but this is one to skip."
2,Not Impressed,"After reading Danielle's ""Echoes"" a few weeks ago, I was so impressed...I LOVED IT! Then I start ""Impossible"" and am TOTALLY disappointed. It was boring...I kept waiting for it to get better and when I finally reached the end, it never did. It was ok...nothing great and nothing I would recommend. It isn't the usual Danielle Steel. I wish she would take more time and construct better stories instead of putting them out one by one without even bothering to make them good stories."
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO BELIEVE!,"I have been a fan of Danielle Steele's for ages. I just got finished reading ""Impossible"" - and I can't believe what a WIMP she made the character of Sasha out to be! Usually, the women in her novels are strong and independant. I found myself talking out loud as I was reading it, wondering how many times she was going to take Liam back! This was definatly a dissapointment."
1,One of her WORST,"This has to be one of the WORST DS books I ever ever bought and I own them all. The plot was obvious from the first chapter and sadly it happens exactly as predicted, which is totally NOT believable. I am so disappointed as her books seem to be losing their grip and bite that keeps you waiting anxiously to read her next books. The last few have been okay at best but this one definitely a waste of time and money. I hope she is paying attention to our comments as she will be losing another lifelong reader and fan."
1,Terribly written and very predictable (as usual),"I have read all of Ms. Steel's previous books and they seem to be getting worse as time goes on. Any author that pumps out 3-4 books a year is not spending enough time on producing a quality novel. I'm tired of the poor English usage, the incomplete sentences and the overuse of certain phrases throughout each book. If I ever have enough time and am bored to death, I will flip through this book and count how many times she uses the words ""wacky artist"". I'm certain this will be the final book I will read by Ms. Steel."
1,Save your money on this one,"I usually like Danielle Steel. Her books are always a quick read and I usually breeze through them. This one, however, I could not even finish. I thought Sunset in St. Tropez was bad. This one is even worse. She used the word ""wacky"" to describe Liam on every other line. Come on, Danielle, use a thesaurus!! Blah blah WACKY blah blah WACKY - and I'm not exaggerating! She made him into a ridiculous character like a child who never got his way and put him in stupid situations, like barging in on Sasha's business meetings with snooty clients. Get real. I was VERY disappointed with this book. I was mad at myself for not trudging through the muck but I could only take so much ""wacky"" artist. Don't even bother with this one."
1,don't -- just don't.,"if you have fond memories of ms steele, or no memory at all because you're new to her, please... don't read this book.liam looks like a child with his long blond hair; he acts up because no one can control him since that's what his parents tried to do to him; he sees any ""no"" as a slap in the face because once again, that's what his parents did to him.sasha looks like a cold woman with her pale skin and dark hair always pulled back; she is totally concerned about her reputation: ""but what will they think of me?"" and can't stand up for her needs; she refuses to lower her standards, but when liam leaves, she falls into a ""morbid depression"" and goes back to him.repeat for 300 pages...""careless,"" ""self-indulgent,"" ""filler"" are three words i'd use to describe it."
2,Steel is losing her touch,"This was one of DS's worst. If I read the words ""wacky artist"" and ""impossible"" one more time, I thought I'd scream. The plot was too predictable, and redundant. How many times can Steel put the reader through a couple getting together, breaking up, getting back together, breaking up, etc. It was so boring! The only excitement happened at the end of the book, which I only got to because I always finish the books I start. I will definitely be taking a break from DS."
2,Boring,This book never really got started. I kept waiting for something to happen. The main character acted as if she was in high school and having every day fun romance. Save your money!
1,Someone stole my line -- Impossible to read,"This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a ""wacky artist"". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the ""wacky artist"" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- ""looked like a big kid"", ""she felt like his mother"", ""his childlike style"" ""he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are"", ""he acted like a bored schoolboy"", ""pouting"", ""acted out, more often than not, like a child"". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it."
2,Danielle what are you doing?!?!,"If I had three words to come up with to describe the plot in this book they would be: ping-pong match.Why is that you ask? Because the characters go back and forth, changing their minds literally probably a hundred times. Do they want to be together or not? Sasha and Liam spent the book either in passionate lust or dislike. I really didn't see ""love"" between them.I have a issue with how they continue to bring up the difference of their ages (9 years apart), as a reason they're not together. 9 years isn't a big deal, and much of the book you spend saying ""Get over it!"" But they never do.Steel's subjects and story line are worn out - I'm sick of gallery owners, and widowers. Come up with something new that hasn't been done that doesn't involve these two subjects! For now, I'm just going to go back and re-read some of her classics. Don't bother with this book - if you must, wait a month or so until you can get one on here or Ebay dirt cheap!"
1,Too Bad to Finish,"The worst book I've read (actually, I was listening to the audiobook). The characters are completely unbelievable and the book is so repetetive that I found myself YELLING at the tape player, ""I KNOW, I KNOW ALREADY"". I couldn't stand the torture anymore, I didn't even finish it. I have enjoyed some of DS's earlier work, but will not buy another."
2,Same old Story,"This story line is probably one you've already read by another author, and it's very easy to tell how the book will end. The details of the book are original, and it does move along and hold your interest, but it's a repeat of a relationship between two people. I was actually surprised that Ms. Steel would go down this road, and not offer something more original."
4,Very Good CJazz!!!,"Alphonse Mouzon's ""As you wish"" album is good! There're great latin influenced ballads like ""As you wish"" and ""A night for love"". Sax player Gary Meek is outstanding on those songs. On ""It's now or Never"" Alphonse Mouzon plays all instruments - a great multi instrumentalist! On the last 6 tracks its more for the showcase of Alphonse Mouzon the worldclass drummer. Tunes like ""If Tomorrow Comes"" or ""One More time"" will please you as drummer or drum fan. ""Give the drummer some"" is a great smoking drum solo. This Cd covers everything - great CJazz melodies, Smooth ballads and smoking drum songs with a funky edge."
3,Audio not in sync!,I just purchased this DVD and I must say I am greatly disappointed!The audio is not in sync!!!The audio is ahead of the video by 1 to 2 seconds.I just can't imagine how this could happen with a Warner Brothers release.Being a huge Rankin and Bass fan this was an utter let down.I hope this error is corrected and Warner Brothers offers some sort of exchange.
2,Not for little ones.,"I love claymation, and we have quite a collection. But I just didn't like this one as well, and I thought it was too scary for little ones. Check out these instead: ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" (this one has the Heat Miser song that another reviewer referred too) and ""Jack Frost"". They're very enjoyable."
3,Tedium interrupted by the brilliance of Ethel Merman,"I am certain that someone thought this was a great idea. Let's take two classic holiday cartoons and make a long, tedious, poorly written musical cartoon out of them. There are more plot twists than a soap opera, and they are written about as convincingly. The only high point here is the appearance of Ethel Merman, doing a take-off of her famous Annie Oakley characterization. It is obvious that this project had been re-tooled over many years, as Merman's voice sounds younger, stronger and in complete control through most of the film. In the last part, you hear the age and wobble evidenced in Ethel's voice in her later years. Merman fans will love this; everyone else will snooze."
4,Great Christmas DVD,I loved the DVD. It came in time for Christmas. The only thing I didn't like was the cover was cracked when I received it.
2,Wrong Song,"I couldn't remember which movie had the ""Heat Miser"" song,so I bought this video based on the above customer review. It DOES NOT have that song in it. My kids like it, though."
4,Marching to his own drummer !,"A Personal Odyssey by Thomas Sowell deserves its title !An extended adventurous journey , no question about it.I would recommend the book to all Americans, whatever theirethnic background as Sowell shows Americans with all theirvirtues and defects.Sowell proves to be a man in the mold of Frank Sinatra :"" I did it my way "" or in the mold of Sammy Davis .I read the well-written and engrossing text with gusto.I gave it a 4-star for only one reason : Sowell seems todisplay an emotional antipathy towards the Democrats . NoDemocrat seems to have earned his respect after paintingthe character of Senator Edward Kennedy.He throws some good images of Clarence Thomas but malignedPatricia Harris .Whether you agree with him or not , this book should be readby all Americans to get a better understanding of their country."
5,Now I know Mr. Sowell a little better.,I borrowed this book from the library a month or so ago. I would recommend this for any young conservative who might find himself a contrarian on a college campus.
4,Not profound but enticing,"Perhaps nothing profound is in this book, but itcan lead the reader to suspect that Thomas Sowellhas written other, deeper things. It is full ofstories about various sorts of irrational bureaucratsin academia, in government, and in the military,maybe not _quite_ as extreme as the pointy-hairedboss in _Dilbert_, but definitely the sort who couldhave inspired that character. Thomas Sowell could beconsidered a sort of minor patron saint (or ""patronhero"" if such a thing exists) of the virtues ofsticking to one's guns, calling the shots as onesees them despite heavy pressure from those whodon't understand, refusing to follow any partydoctrine as if it were infallible dogma, and caringabout one's students."
4,Great Read,"As a Native American and Hispanic, Sowell brings hope for those attending school and getting into a profession. I too served in the Marine Corps and had it rough from the start but it took that training for me to appreciate the social sciences. Sowell is a man of genuis and he should be honored as a great teacher. We credit his works. America is stronger for Sowell."
1,Boring.,This book was awful. Wood rambled on and on about absolutely nothing. The plot is slow and the way she writes it makes it slower.Don't waste your time.
5,One of the year's best first books.,"I didn't put this book down until the end. I was sorry when it ended and wished I had the ability to put a really good book down and savory it a little.The characters were my familiar friends and neighbors brought to life in a place much like the mountain village of New Mexico I call home. There is great insight and compassion for people in this novel and a new, poetic style of storytelling that takes the reader far away from the asphalt and the noise and the pace of life.Buy one for yourself and your sister and your best friend. My father read my copy while visiting and loved this book. We are waiting for the next one by this great new author."
5,Wow,"Life changing, because this book is personal, especially the verse ""whom my soul loveth"" - someone loves me regardless of my down falls! Going thru a very hard time in my life and reading this, set me free."
5,Song of Love,"This is the most awesome book, this book changed my life and also helped me have a more detailed knowledge of the love relationship of our Heavenly Bridegroom, Thank you Rev. Hicks for such an awesome book."
1,Good luck trying to read this book in one sitting,"Ok, so I downloaded this and grabbed a cup of coffee hoping to spend a relaxing day off from work and read a book through. Forget about finishing it in one sitting. Its extremely detailed verse by verse. Sometimes the imagery is exaggerated and goes on-and-on. It can seem a bit too poetical at times, too. How many real people get this absorbed with loving God?"
5,Awesome study,"I have read many accounts of the book, Song of Solomon. But none have been written soeloquently to describe the love of our LORD Jesus with such fervor and intensity. This by far is the best book written on the market in terms of revelation and content. The principles are conducive through out the bible. What an awesome read. I would recommend this to anyone who is sincere about biblical study and bibilical revelation. This book is also useful in a continued study of God's word."
3,Reminiscent of the Contemplative Tradition,"It seems to me that this book is written in the Contemplative Tradition of religious scholarship, whereby believers yearn for an ever-closer relationship to God, whom they view as the ultimate beloved. I found this book to have some similar elements to the theologies of Hildegard of Bidgen, Saint Theresa of Avilla and Saint John of the Cross. It's not about ""positive thinking""; it's a serious textual analysis and a thoroughly developed theological stance on the Song of Solomon. It's quite heavy reading, so it may not be for everyone."
5,A Real Love Story,How beautiful to fall in love with Jesus and how wonderfully detailed this book is in explaining what true love with our Precious Bridegroom looks like.
2,"not very technical, and mostly low level when it is","This book will tell you about Brocade's stock price and EMC's corporate culture, and about computer forensics' need of SAN storage, and about FC-AL, but if you need to know the different scalability characteristics of GFS versus StorageTank for your SAN file system, this is the wrong book. I do like the fact that VAXclusters get mentioned; too many books think SAN means Fibre Channel only. ""IDE"" in this context means ""integrated drive electronics"", NOT ""integrated development environment"". Overall, I think the lack of information on how you turn a pile of hardware into a working system is a big drawback."

1,arbogast weedless jitterbug,I too ordered the weedless jitterbug pictured here... I too was sent the WRONG item... the item sent was NOT a weedless jitterbug... it was a muskie size jitterbug with treble hooks on the side and a treble hook on the back... nothing weedless about it at all... I would recommend you NOT buy it unless you want the muskie size regular jitterbug...because that is what you'll get
1,Not weed less as advertised,I got it on time but it wasn't as advertised. It is not weed less and does't look like what they show.
3,"Wrong item, but still useful for me I guess...","They sent a ""Jitterbug XL"" instead of a ""Weedless Jitterbug"", but since I only paid 6 dollars or so I figured it was not worth returning and I could use it anyway so I just kept it.Cool lure for stripers, largemouth, and some other larger fish"
3,Why MGM isn't remembered for its horror films,"Neither of these films is very good. Mark of the Vampire has a potentially amusing twist ending that is ruined by continuity problems and a talky script that makes it seem much longer than an hour. The Mask of Fu Manchu is worth watching only for Boris Karloff's genial performance as the good Doctor, Myrna Loy as his smoking hot daughter, and the campy sets and art design. It also serves as a reminder or revelation to modern audiences of how appallingly racist popular entertainment often was in the first half of the last century."
4,Good Game,"If you own the home system, then i suggest you buy the accessory set. The home system gives you 750 pre-programed trivia questions but with the expansion your trivia knowledge will be expanded to history, music, and tv triavia. I would suggest this because if you love hanging around with your friends and have a good time then buzz time is it. The only problem i have with buzz time,if you don't have the expansion, is that the same questions tend to pop up all the time. You don't have that problem with the accessory set."
4,Buzztime Accessory Set,"Fun for all & A good learning experience while playing!Good questions from the past, but could use an updated question or two here & there!But over a a good time!thank You!"
1,Horrible,"Do not buy from this seller. There are typos throughout, and it is the worst version of a ""book"" that I have ever seen. It was even missing the last several pages of the book."
2,All that glitter is not gold,"This product took forever and ever to ship.Almost impossible to contact them. I could not find customer service phone number. If they care, they should know that not everyone chats on the net.For a tall guy, seating on this chair is like descending into abyss.For me, my muscles cramp while trying to rock this chair. It just takes much effort to rock.Since I didn't have time to return it, I just toss my kid in it.Regrets. Money wasted."
1,"Be prepared to replace parts A, B, C & D = $$$$ when all you need is part A","The price is right, right? Wrong - you will pay later, and dearly. My unit cost about $160. Cracked the nozzle tip - no problem I have seen numerous replacement nozzles - wrong, I have to replace the whole Vario wand attachment - cost $50 plus $17 S & H - this after light use occasionally for just over a year (out of warranty). Three of these and I will have bought a new unit (for a cheap plastic nozzle insert the size of a quarter). Plus the pressure hose and inlet hose fittings are cheap and nasty - you are better off buying a more expensive unit (ever wonder why these seem like such a good deal when all others around seem so expensive). You get what you pay for, very dissapointing from a company I had a high opinion of."
1,Motor kept overheating,"I had this item for about a week before returning it, when I did, the woman at customer service said one comes back each week. It worked great for about 15 to 20 minutes then it would blow the fuse. After tripping the fuse, it worked again for 5 minutes then the fuse blew again. Then the unit wouldn't turn on at all. It did work again a couple of days later, this time for maybe 10 minutes. Then, nothing. That can't be normal."
1,Failure prone,"I bought one a little over a year ago. It failed within 9 months, and the manufacturer had to send me 4 different ""rebuilt"" units before I got one that was OK. Now, past the 12-month warranty, it has failed again. Karcher will only repair these at one shop in Illinois. There is no local service. It's very heavy and the shipping costs are enormous.Never again will I buy a Karcher product. I have learned my lesson!"
1,"Trigger leaks, after 1 use","I purchased mine from a local Sears store late last summer. It leaked a bit from the trigger handle, about enough to soak my shoes after cleaning the patio.Stored it in a HEATED garage over the winter, WITHOUT solution in it. Tried to use it again this week, and the leak has become a torrent. Took apart the handle, there is a 3"" vertical crack in a hard plastic tube that connects the flexible hose to the actual trigger. The crack is in the plastic and not a seam, so I believe the plastic part was either under engineered or made of poor plastic. In total, I've used this unit maybe 2 hours.Tried to get help via email customer service, they were pleasant until I said that can't find my receipt. Since then they've decided to ignore my problem.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY ON THIS. Rent one instead."
1,Some Assembly Required,I was unable to connect the hose to the trigger grip. Instructions said to use a small screwdriver to move a tab on the trigger grip that causes a locking mechanism to slide out. Then the hose is inserted into the handle/trigger grip. The mechanism is then slid back in to lock the hose into the grip. I was unable to move the tab so that the locking mechanism would slide out. The unit was returned and never used. The dealer did not seem interested in demonstrating how this procedure was supposed to work. The failure may have been my lack of assembly skills as opposed to a problem with the product.
3,Color ink ran out to fast,These compatible cartridges are a little cheaper that the HP variety but the colors run out quicker and do not give an even color at the end of the cartridge. ExpensiveLetta Meinen
3,Some good..quality of film poor,"I love IMAX films, however, these weren't their best and the quality is not very good---sound and picture is below average. Difficult to hear the narrator in many of the films---also, film is not bright or as clear. Price was very low but the product was also. Disappointed---maybe purchasing Blu-ray individual copies is best."
2,Disappointed,"When I purchased this item I thought the videos were in 3D since I put 3D movies in the search bar. They are not 3D and with a 60"" wide screen TV all you get is a small block in the middle of the screen where the video is. Make sure this is what you really want or you will be disappointed like I was."
2,Imax,"Disappointed. I look for films under 3D. This IMAX set poped up , ok I realize it was not 3d , why it was there I feel was dishonest , at least blue ray - nope !!! Content good , but it should of been at least blur ray. Anyone , wait till IMAX releases on blue ray or 3D , this is not worth the price, you can see just as good on discovery channel"
2,Good...But Not Great,"There are several DVDs in this collection (~20). My family and I have only watch about five of the DVDs more than once. Besides these five DVDs, there were others that were interesting and/or good to watch. Overall, I don't think that we got the value of our purchase...considering the alternatives."
2,Poor quality,Crappy quality. Fires of Kuwait was blurry and couldn't read any of the credits. Big disappointment. Returned it pretty quick.
1,DVD PLAYER CANT PLAY T,i HEVE BOUGHT THiS DVD COLLECTiON SET BUT NON OF MY BLUERAY PLAYERS CAN NOT PLAY THEM. i HAVE HARMON KARDON DBS600 SOUNBAR WiTH BLUERAY PLAYER SYSTEM AND ALSO HAVE A PiONEER BDP 430 BLUERAY PLAYER EVEN BOTH THEM CAN NOT PLAY THE DVD'S.i ALSO SAY THAT MY BLUERAY SYSTEMS BOTH OF THEM HAVE A MULTI REGEiON CODE FUNCTioN AND THE ERROR that players gave iS UNKNOWN REGiON CODE.i GAVE 0 STARS FOR THAT.i BOUGHT THS SET AND EVEN CAN NOT WATCH THEM!!!
3,California Zephyr-Ultimate Fan Trip LP's evaluation,"The photography was excellent, but there were too many redundant scenes. More time could have focused on the equipment that made up the train."
5,Interesting and Sometimes Funny,This survival tale was interesting and well written. Butler's wife proved to be a great sailor and the way she sometimes express her anger at her husband made me laugh at times. Makes me wonder if all that praying they did actually helped them through their ordeal especially with that flimsy raft for so many days. The story was very descriptive I couldn't put it down.
4,Gripping TRUE life survival of an imperfect man,"I spent a few days on a windy beach in Hawaii reading this gripping tale of survival. As an experienced sailor, I found his tale rings true of the days of monotony, fear and terror that you sometimes encounter in a single 24 hour period on the open ocean.The other reveiwers who rate this low for monotony and the bravado of the author miss the point about the story. The author clearly has personal issues and suffers from a lack of objectivity. For example, he appears very unkind at times to his wifes and children.But Butler is a survivor. It is interesting to follow the tale and try to understand what makes the author tick.It would have been a better book if his wife Simmone had written a parallel account to balance the enormous ego driven Butler. An objective professional writer could have written a better treatment but then it may have been sensationalized and lose the genuine quality of the tale.It is worth a read."
1,"An arrogant, gruff man and his boring, repetitious book","I agree with others who say this is a boring read. Once they are in the raft it is nothing but the two of them arguing about the same things every day it seems. The author comes off as arrogant at best. Save your money or buy some other sailing book. Dumas' Alone Through the Roaring Forties is a good choice, as are the books by Francis Chichester and Bernard Moitessier. Or better yet, just buy your own sailboat and experience the most sublime thing one can do--singlehanded sailing."
2,Overall disappointment,"I agree with whichever reviewer wrote that this was a great story poorly written.I am so happy that the Butlers survived their ordeal. I think that this story had a lot of potential. I know it must have been difficult to fill all those pages with exciting prose, but it does get monotonous after awhile. The dialogue is excrutiating to slog through. After reading about two weeks worth of Simone's whining and Bill's chest-puffing denial, I would have wanted to be eaten by sharks. And if Simone didn't divorce Bill for his behavior before this ordeal, she should have after she read what he had to say about how great she'd look after she starved for a few more weeks on the raft. What a schmuck! As we say here in the midwest, the man needs killin'!Would have loved to have seen photos of the Butlers, their boat, their family, the raft after their rescue, etc. Also would like to know more about why whales would sink a boat and how many times this type of thing has happened in the past."
1,Snore,"I don't like to write bad reviews, but I have to say, this might be the worst book I've ever started to read. I couldn't finish it because:1) It was very repetitious. I naively thought the chapters would move the story along. The only thing that changed was the weather.2) William Butler is kind of unlikable. I felt like he put himself up on a pedestal. He rarely talked of his fears and his self doubts. It was mostly about how smart and brave he was.Read ""Adrift"" intead of this stinker . . . . I mean sinker."
4,Fast paced and exciting even though I found author arrogant,"Even though I found the author somewhat arrogant, I couldn't put this book down. His honest account of their terrifying ordeal made by heart pound.I felt like I was there.I didn't find his recounting of their ordeal monotonous because his detail made it seem even more real. I did find myself disliking him somewhat but I think it's a testament to a writer when you can like their book but not care for their character. I found myself sympathizing a lot with his wife.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."
5,A Gripping Tale,"66 Days Adrift is an exciting story that i read in a couple of sittings, it was hard to put down! Based on a true story, it is a most gripping tale with a bittersweet ending. Buy the book, you won't be disappointed."
1,could use a proofreader,"The publishers intend to print large type editions for those who want/need them. This is admirable, but the execution is sloppy.For example, line 57 of Lycidas in their large print edition reads:""RHad ye been there, S...for what could that have done?""The text (Viking Press edition) is actually:""Had ye been there!- for what could that have done?""The nonsensical extra capital letters, the omission of the exclamation point, and the insertion of an ellipsis all either change the sense of the text and/or are distracting and annoying or both.The blurb on the back of the book is very funny(unintentionally, I'm guessing):""It is a spectacular collection of poems and songs in which Milton's particular dramatic and natural chic is evident.""Milton? chic??"
3,Nancy Drew: Stay Tuned for Danger,"My Daughter loved playing the adventure. It will not work on a Windows 7 computer, but it does great on older computers. She can't wait to get the next adventure."
1,Doesn't work on newer computers,My kids love Nancy Drew PC games but this one will not download on newer computers. Our computer is a few years old and I sent the first game back thinking something was wrong with the disc. The new one I received will not download either. Very disappointed the kids can't play it.
3,What a good but frustrating game !!!!!!!,I think this game is pretty good.The problem is I am stuck in a place in which I don't know what to do!!!! This game is pretty much very challenging.Although it is exciting!!!
2,"Game Gets ""Stuck""","I played ""Secrets Can Kill"" and really enjoyed it. The clues in ""Stay Tuned for Danger"" seem mostly irrelevant and then the game ceases to progress as the other game did. I've tried to reach the company for support but they're not very responsive. I find it difficult to believe that a 10-year-old would succeed with this game without substantial adult support."
1,Stay tuned for Danger,It would have been nice if the seller stated that the game wouldnt play on any new systems. I have Windows Vista and apparently the game is too old for it. All other Nancy Drews I have purchased work fine. I had to toss the game away.
2,"Fun, but Freaky!","While I did find STFD fun, it was quite freaky at times. I found a hidden message in a script, and I felt a chill come up my spine. Her Interactive really messed up the original Nancy Drew series by coming up with these computer games."
5,Challenging and Addictive,"After complaints from my 11 and 15 year old girls that this game was too hard, I decided to try, Stay Tuned for Danger, to see if I could help them advance. I ended up purchasing the Official Solutions Guide for this game because STFD is extremely difficult, even for an adult! If you are an adult who has lots of spare time to spend on an addictive computer game, then don't hesitate to buy this game! Although the graphics and details are mesmerizing, children around the ages of mine will probably get frustrated and give up if they are left to solve it on their own."
5,great game,"this is a fun game, good for mystery fans to solve and for people who are starters. if you are interested in mysteries but can't find good games this is the series and a good game to start with. it is a little difficult, though, but its barely frustrating. the graphics are good, the mystery is good, and there is nothing bad about it."
5,Stay Tuned for a review,"This game is terrific. Although its graphics are not up-to-par with later Nancy Drew Mystery Games, this whole game is still, quite simply, wonderful. The characters are the most complex of any game, and at times you don't know who did what! You are able to visit 3 locations by taxi, and explore them. The settings are vivid and clues and/or red herrings are everywhere.The climax is exhilarating, and altogether, Stay Tuned for Danger is worth buying."
5,Stay Tuned for ADDICTION!,"My son and daughter are both 14 and they even love these games. The picture makes you feel as though you are right in the studio. I recommend it for ANYONE who is in for a challenge and some fun, too. You will love this game, I guarentee! But be warned........... you may become addictided to playing!"
3,12 year old Nancy Drew Software Lover,"I do recomend ""Stay tuned for danger"" to kids 11 and up This was my seconed Nancy Drew game I didn't finish ""Secrets can Kill."" Stay tuned for Danger is easy utill I reached a part where I still can not pass although I do get help from my cosion who is 22. The game starts out that a star from a T.V. show has been recieving death threats. You as Nancy have to find who is causing them."
4,"Fun, but not as Exciting","Overall, this Nancy Drew game was pretty much AWESOME. But there is a qualitiy of a good mystery missing here. Suspense. This game isn't THAT exciting until the end, and I'm not going to tell you what happens there! I didn't like taking taxi's everywhere either. But that wasn't THAT annoying. Otherwise, I recommend this Nancy Drew game as I do all others (except Secrets Can Kill) . Her Interactive scores again! Please tell me if this review was helpful or not. Thanks."
2,a real disappointment,"I was really disappointed with this Nancy Drew game. I have several others and just love them even though I'm a ""grown-up mother of four""! I'm usually so hooked I have to force myself away from the computer. This one was very boring, to me. I wondered if it was an older game and I have become used to the newer releases. I missed the large number of puzzles in some of the other games and the tasks and challenges of other titles like Secret of the Scarlet Hand and Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake. I felt there just wasn't as much to do...maybe I didn't like having to think it through so much; don't know. There also seemed to be a lot of things that weren't essential to the game that really just threw me off. I don't think this is one of the better ND games, but everyone's different! Looks like a lot of other buyers enjoyed it."
5,Wow!,"Here you are again as Nancy Drew now solving another mystery: Why is Rick Arlen, the soap opera star of ""Light of Our Love,"" receiving these horribe death threats? And why is it that everyone in and out of the studio seems to have something against him? You're about to set foot as an extra on the set to sneak around to find out more about the odd death threats. Even clues from cod liver oil to 3D glasses could become important in ""Stay Tuned for Danger.""Oh, wow! The characters are now 3D in the second of the Nancy Drew PC game series. This game was so much easier than the first, no 2-disk garbage, and an amazing story that you almost want to never end! Two thumbs up!"
5,I couldn't stop playing it!,"The second game in this exciting series proved just as appealing as the first. I was kept busy for hours as I snooped around a New York T.V. studio finding puzzles and clues to help unlock the mystery of a stalker sending threats to a Soap Opera star. The game's graphics are terrific, the plot is believable and the puzzles are quite challenging but solvable. The company did away with that pesky two disk system from the last game so everything went alot smoother too. My only complaint is that it was not really possible to deduce the culprit as the evidence seemed to incriminate everyone. However,this is one of the few quality games that appeals to players that want to do more than just blow someone's head off. This game accomplishes everything it attemps to do and is alot of fun to play. Cheers to Her Interactive- I can't wait for the next one."

3,An OLD sleuth revived...,"My younger days were spent with my nose in a Nancy Drew book and I read almost every one the other day I was in the store and saw this Nancy Drew Stay Tuned for Danger game and thought I'd treat myself to see what it was about. I had become so bored with the computer lately!I love this game...it does have it's quirks and I did think I was stuck, but with the help of my 11 year old son, he helped me figure some things out. Today when I talked to him on the phone he was working on solving this although he would never tell his friends he was doing a ""Nancy Drew game""...so while I can't wait to play the next games They would love these!"
3,Too linear!,"This game *is* fun, but too often you have to take thingsin a specific sequence! If you've already solved a puzzleyou shouldn't have to go back three steps and solve itagain (and again, and again) to put it ""where it belongs"".Also, unlike the other Nancy Drew games, navigation is aroyal pain. The ""turn back"" arrow just un-zooms, ratherthan actually turn around; there are too many places whereyou can only turn left instead of right, etc., etc..I give it a ""C""."
3,"Actually 3-4 stars, not just 3","This Nancy Drew game was a HUGE step from the previous one. The graphics were much better and you didn't have to switch between 2 CDs. There's only one this time! This one, I must say, was the hardest of all the Nancy Drew games. You always got stuck and didn't know what to do. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing. But if that ever happens, you can just go to the message board at herinteractive.com to ask for help. Anyhow, the mystery was very interesting and it was a really fun game. I recommend this for all children (although they might need some help). It's especially good for children during summer time, winter break, and spring break. BUY IT!"
1,Not helpful for the current census exam,"This book is useless for preparing for the current census enumerator exam. The practice questions apply very poorly to the current exam and the quality is often ""copy of a copy of a copy."" Pretty shameful stuff.Instead, download the free practice exam from the census. The questions there match the actual exam well and it will help you prepare."
4,Sunbeam/Oster Wall Mounted Hair Dryer,"The hair dryer works well and was easy to install.It was a little larger than I expected.Overall, happy with the product."
4,Convenient little hair dryer,"I use this Sunbeam hair dryer every time I stay at an Embassy Suites hotel. They mount to the wall, so there's always one available when needed and they stay out of the way. The cord is coiled, which means no tangles but it's long enough for my needs. There's a high and low setting but I always use high.The only improvements I'd suggest are locating the on/off button on the hair dryer and not on the wall mount, and it would be nice if the hair dryer had a little more power. I'd buy one of my own, if they could do that. Otherwise, it does the job."
5,Replacement unit,We had the previous model for over 5 years. Worked every day till the heating element broke. So we had to replace it. New unit is only improved. Uses the previous mounting hardware on the wall. We expect great things for this replacement.
5,Very Convenient,I have purchased several of these for both of my houses. I use it in our own bathroom and all guest bathrooms. It is very convenient. The quality of Oster is also top notch. Highly recommended.
5,Third one I've owned - great and clutter free!,"This is a great product. It is really simple to hang, works well, and keeps the countertops clutter-free. We have been so happy with it, we've purchased the Sunbeam one each time... years in-between - it lasts well."
5,Excellent Choice,This works just great by hanging it on the wall it is always ready for use but up out of the way
3,You can't learn a language without audio,"You seriously cannot learn another language without audio. This is very true when it comes to asian languages. The book is good for learning how to write and the proper direction. Along with, additional words to add to your vocabulary. I am glade it doesn't have only romaji on the those words either. But, i could not learn the basics through this book. Too much was going on inside to concentrate on the goal at hand. I would recommend anyone that doesn't use a computer program to get flash cards with audio and even the dumbest user, like myself; can learn the Japanese basics."
2,Too basic; get Let's Learn Hiragana instead,"This is a nice book with many beautiful illustrations and colors, which makes it great for kids, but it doesn't help much with learning Hiragana. All the characters are there with the proper strokes, but nothing is mentioned about important concepts like how to end strokes (tome - ""stop""; hane - ""jump""; harai - ""sweep"") and diacritical marks (changing ka into ga for example). I feel that it is a very limited learning tool.On the other hand, I highly recommend ""Let's Learn Hiragana"" (Let's Learn Hiragana: First Book of Basic Japanese Writing (Kodansha's Children's Classics)) and the other books from that series."
5,Edu-tainment at its best,"&quot;Jimi's Book of Japanese&quot; is edutainment at its best. The Japanese language and culture lessons are so simple, they'll stick to your skull wall like a well-chewed clump of bubblicious! I bought this for my daughter, but it is great for an adult. This is a remarkable book!"
3,Not as exciting as anticipated,"I got bored with this book after going through it several times. It's not as straightforward as a textbook, but it's not as fun as it looks because of the distracting vocabulary entries and sometimes overly extensive facts about Japan. It has the advantage of showing the shape and stroke order of each hiragana character in giant size, so it's not bad for learning to write hiragana. I found it distracting that sometimes the vocabulary words were irrelevant to the hiragana character on each page. The book seemed to get a little too sidetracked. The pictures were nice, but they are repeated at the back of the book, which is unnecessary. It does include a glossary for defining words that aren't obvious from looking at the pictures. It might be best for someone who is just exploring Japanese but not seriously studying it."
5,Jimi's Book of Japanese,"I'm a sophomore in high school and I use this book to help me learn the language easily and quickly. I hope to go on the foreign exchange program--hopefully to Tokyo or Kyoto, or possibly Osaka. I'm writing people's Japanese names and my teacher's too for extra credit. I've been studying Katakana and Hiragana since grade seven and this book has been the biggest help to me yet. Thank you, Peter Takahashi!"
5,Wonderful introduction!,"Brightly colored, interesting information, easy presentation... this book has everything a beginner needs! I am so glad I purchased it, and I can't speak highly enough about it!"
5,B-757,"This book is a great source of background material on the design and building of the 757.Loads of info on the innards of the aircraft, who bought/flys it. Tons of photos of the aircraft in its many liveries."
4,Great if you want to know almost everything about the 757,"Ok this book is a great general guide to the 757. It contains details of design, flight test, airline operations and more. It doesn't delve too much into technical details but you do learn about the engine choices and such. As well you see photos of every origional operator and some secondary operators as well. This book was published a few years back so any new operators and paint schemes won't be here but it is a great starter book if you like this particular model."
5,Incredible film!,"Knowing the budget was limited, I think it's incredible that the filmmakers achieved a $100 million look for the movie! The action is over the top and I only wish Jackie Chan had been in the movie a little longer. I highly recommend ""Shaolin""!"
5,Good foreign Action film,"It is a new age to be able to watch a Chinese film and be pleased it doesn't have funny sounds and over-acting. The view was beautiful, the high quality of the film. I love seeing Jackie Chan even if it isn't a leading role."
2,Audio description is incorrect,"This is a great movie. However, the description is wrong, it is supposed to have Mandarin audio. It does not. It only has Cantonese and English audio. The back of the box also says Mandarin audio so apparently the manufacturer screwed this up. If it had the correct audio, I would have given it 5 stars."
3,More martial arts would have been nice,"Hmmm...I'm not really a super authority on Chinese movies, though I do enjoy martial arts flicks. This movie was good, but I was hoping for more explosive action. I ordered this because it's not bad, but I wish had more action like Ip Man or the Man from No Where. Still, it's very good and not a bad movie to watch."
3,Lukewarm plot but somewhat entertaining.,"This movie is sporadically engaging.I think what I like about this movie is the representation of Buddhist principles of peace, non-violence and a pacifist code of conduct.While the plot is anything but novel, the scenery and cinematography are excellent. The spirit of Buddhism is very well portrayed.On another note, While the movie has a strong component of Buddhist philosophy, which advocates respect for all living things, I did notice that a lot of horses were used in stunts.I am hoping that the Hong Kong/ Chinese movie industry is a believer in protecting animal rights and in ensuring the safety of animals.I am hopeful but am not too sure that this is the case."
3,bootleg?,"When I first tried this video the english subtitles did not come up ( thought it was bootleg). However, after using a different dvd, it finally had english subs. It was just a hassle to change dvds. Otherwise the movie was ok :D"
1,Shaolin,I can not give a review of this dvd as I am returning it. This is all in Chinese with English subtitles only. I thought the description said it was dubbed in English. I had watching a movie in one language and trying to watch the action going on and having to read was is being said in the subtitles. It just doesn't work. You either miss the action or what is being said.
4,Love it,"This is now one of my favorite movies. This was purchased for me as a Christmas present. I am greatly involved in the study of martial arts. It moves a bit slow to set up the story line in the beginning. However, I love it. One of my favorite movies I've watched this year. Jackie Chan's 100th movie I believe. He is an odd part in the movie but he does it well."
4,Great,Another Awesome addition to the Library. Title speaks for itself. Recommend Shaolin for avid martial arts movie collectors! Great fighting scenes and choreography.
1,Too discordant for such a lovely voice,"I loved her voice, having heard a song on TV with acoustic accompaniment. A very leisurely almost swanky jazz song was sang.But this CD is alot of electric guitar discordant tones, I can hardly listen to it...... I will sell it at best, but surely never listen to it again."
2,I hate this album.,1) It's not like The Cardigans to play sound like this. 2) I hate this album. 3) Don't buy this album. 4) This album is totally different from Emmerdale and Life. 5) Emmerdale and Life are much much better than Gran Turismo.
1,what happened????,"I loved their previous two cds and bought this one based on that. I'd offer to resell this one, but it wouldn't even be worth the postage."
2,Is this really The Cardigans?,"Wow! This CD is so totally different from the group's last CD, First Band on the Moon, that I hardly recognised it. If you liked the Cardigans' first CDs, this may not be a great one to buy. The group's former fun-type sound has been basically washed down the drain. All the songs sound very dreary, like they've gotten stuck in a rainy day for way too long. However, it may be a good CD if you like the talent of the Cardigans, but didn't like the upbeat style."
5,Really moving music.,"I didn't really care for Lovefool very much, but after hearing ""My Favourite Game"" on the radio, I thought that I might check out this album. The Cardigans have established a darker and more mature sound with this new album and I cannot stop listening to this. All of the tracks are fabulous, except ""Explode"". This album is for any fan of trip-hop or even alternative music. Anybody who gives this album anything under four stars does not appreciate or recognize good music when it appears in front of them. I hope that those who ripped apart this album with one-star reviews stay away from all other good albums so that they don't curse them - with bad reviews. All ""Lovefool"" fans should stay away also - this new sound is not at all like that annoying top 40 hit. ""Gran Turismo"" is a wonderful and dark way to escape the torture of peppy, annoying music that you'll often find plauging the radio stations."
2,"A thin, tuneless, forgettable release.","Overall this CD is really disappointing. Each song drags on with peppy but weak drum loops, random guitar gibberish and whining, incredibly tuneless vocals that make the hum-drum sound even worse. It takes a lot for me to dislike a record, but this CD has all that and then some."
5,Brilliant,"This CD is so mysterious, beautiful, and strange. I concur that Sweden has the best bands in the world. Nina has such a well i don't know how to describe voice- childlike innocence yet dark? You just have to listen to this and experience top notch music."
3,one really good song,"Bought this after hearing Erase/Rewind in the movie ""13th Floor"" (very interesting flick). Thought perhaps other songs will be good too - was disappointed. Some songs were OK, but nothing really strong on this album. Should have just bought the one song..."
3,the lyrics are sort of stupid,"They tried to change their sound into something like trip-hop or pop or whatever... but the music is okay... kind of depressing. Don't even pay attention to the lyrics, they don't make sense and its like they do it on purpose so it makes them seem cooler."
5,Beautiful vocals blend with surreal melodies.,"""This is where your sanity ends..."" with those words, the Cardigans define an album that could easily be a soundtrack to a dream underwater, where you drown forever... Electronic rhythms blending with wistful melodies allow the manic in each of us to react, while lovers wait on bleak shores as the vocals cry out to us from an icy, surreal depth which the Cardigans base Gran Turismo on. No matter what music you listen to, this CD is a must for every music listener."
2,This is definitely not much your standard Cardigans album,"I bought this album at the closing of a certain store. However when I listened to it I was like this can't be The Cardigans! This album was the hugest disappointment I have ever had to face. It's not as if there are no good songs on this album such as the title song ""My Favorite Game"" for example, but there are nearly no good songs on this album. There album ""The First Band On The Moon"" was much better and this really stunk!"
1,absolute trash from the formerly brilliant pop group,"life and emmerdale are two of the most magnificent and exceptional albums of the decade. first band on the moon, while not as fundamental as its predecessors, was also a very great record. brilliant b-sides, wonderful live performances, and charming personalities only enhanced an already perfect combination of pop smarts and musical genius. so what in heaven's name happened on gran turismo?! gone are the melodies, the backing vocals, the shining 60s moments of pop perfection. instead we're privy to hookless throwaway tunes and (gasp) ineffective trip-hop! this would be an unlistenable album by anyone but to hear it with the memory of the cardigans' undeniably brilliant first two records in your mind is downright nauseating. i don't know when i'll be able to digest solid food again."
3,hmmm....Not a favorite,"This CD isn't too awful. It actually has a few great tracks on it. However, if you're a Cardigan fan, purchase with this in mind: the sound in radically different from their earlier albums (all of which I enjoyed much more than Gran Turismo).Once you get that straight, you can appreciate this Cd for its artistic merit. But you'll probably be a little dissapointed anyway."
3,Not bad,"The album has a few good songs on it. The new sound of the band is not as dark as others have suggested. However, like other Cardigan albums, there are a few songs that are not good at all. This is a little more than half a good album."
4,The Cardigans Change Their Wardrobe For Gran Turismo,"The Cardigans have come a long way since ""Lovefool"" and ""Been It"". They were: 60s-sounding happy pop band who were darlings of radio and MTV in the late 90s. They are now: experimental, thoughtful, and a little edgier. Change is good. Without it, Alanis would still be playing the Nickelodeon audience. On Gran Turismo, The Cardigans get trip-hoppy; with a Portishead/Bjork feel, all done with the casualness of their lounge-pop days. Nina never sounded so jaded and beautiful, and on such in your face tracks like ""My Favorite Game"" and ""Hanging Around"", she brings down the house. While the album doesnt break much ground, its quite accessible and worth a spin.Way too underrated, this is one band we may need to watch out for."
3,so so,"I have only ever hear the Cardy's on the radio. I borrowed this from the library as I wasnt that confident to buy it. Sure, she has a sexy voice that can transform a dull song into bedtime listening!!!I am writing this review for only one reason though. Explode/Implode... ermmm... how they didnt get sued for copying Stairway To Heaven I will never understand.One more reason, Erase/Rewind - great track. The rest of the album is listen and shelve it.Cheers"
2,JUST FOR TOURIST,"First listen: "" What?...Just ""My favourite Game"" is good? no, here must be another good song""Second: ""Ok, now i know this is a waste of time""third: "" Do you believe"" ""Junk of the Hearts"" "" Erase/Rewind"" and maybe just maybe ""Paralized"" could be so-so tracks.CONCLUSION: I want my money back.The entired cd is so slow, calm, and i was waiting some strong tracks, whit fast rythms...but i got this. Nina Person ( The blond singer) have a nice voice, but whit this album i was fooled like a tourist in a foreing land."
3,"""I don't know what you're looking for...""","The Cardigans album Gran Turismo is very interesting and strange to say the least. Lead singer Nina Peerson's vocals and excellent songwriting keeps this album shining from start to finish. Standout tracks include: My Favourite Game, Higher, Junk of Hearts, and Erase and Rewind. This album isn't perfect but it is a mellow and enjoyable disc. Decide for yourself on this one."
1,Big FAILURE,"I got this CD few weeks ago. I did not like it AT ALL. I decided to give it couple of weeks to see if the songs would grow one. But there was nothing good I could find. Their last CD was much better, and this one should just be forgotten. 0 out of 5 stars from me."
2,Why did they change?,"This album was terrible. I mean the lyrics were good and everything but the lead singers voice does not sound good against deep dark electronica. Maybe if they decide to stay with this type of music they could get someone else.. although I would miss her. Also this cd has the shortest number of tracks than there previous ones, and really, I think they tried too fast to put out this album. Don't judge the cardigans by this cd.. judge by there older music. ""The first band on the moon"" and ""life"" are two of my favorite cd's... and I'm into rock. But I suppose every cd has its good songs.. even if there are few. I did like erase/rewind, hanging around, and I guess my favourite game was standable. Although ""Nil"" the 11th and last track is only about one minute of piano music which sounds scary at first look but then becomes beatiful the more you listen to it. By the way I looked Nil up in the dictionary, it stands for nothing-zero. Kind of like this cd compared to there older ones."
3,I'm undecided,"As brilliant as this album is, I can't help but note the Portishead(who I also love) in almost every song. I love Nina's voice, it's hard not to feel like you're being wrapped in a blanket with her vocals, but I was hoping for more of the Sixty-ish happy tunes, like Tomorrow from Life or Lovefool from FBOTM.Turning to darker music with depressing lyrics has just made them like a lot of other bands. Almost every song you hear on the radio today is depressing in some way. I'm not saying they're bad songs, and I'm not saying the songs on this album are bad, but I miss the happy summer tunes that make you feel good about the world. That's how the Cardigans started out; why couldn't they have stuck to that?But anyways, pick up this album because it's still great, but don't expect it to be like Life. And if anyone gets offended by my review, I'm sorry; this is just my opinion. I still think the Cardigans are great."
1,only one great song on this,"Don't get me wrong I love the Cardigans but the only song I ever put into my iPod is ""My Favourite Game."" Like much of the Cardigans catalogue, there are a lot of less than stellar tracks. They're a singles band really."
3,This CD.....,"Okay this cd was good but the only word that I can think of to summarize it is morbid. The songs are defenitly depressiing and have a melancholy feel to them. Also, after listening to this CD for a while the songs became bland ( the later tracks of the CD that is ). To be honest I prefer to listen to the more upbeat songs on their previous albums like "" carnival "" from their album life and "" lovefool "" from their album First Band on the Moon. I mean I became a fan or their music because I admired their unique upbeat music style. Gran Turismo was kind of a shick to me."
4,Not bad,"I liked the CD. It was really ""dark"", but I liked it. If you are looking for more optimistic and lively songs, try The Cardigans' previous albums. Either way, they rock!"
4,The music finally matches the message,"I have been a fan of the Cardigans for a while, and I've always been a little annoyed that people listen to Lovefool and assume that the rest of their music is a clone of the ultimate happy-pop of their biggest hit. In much the same way that Brick, Ben Folds Five's biggest commercial success, was unlike anything else that they did, Lovefool was not at all what The Cardigans were about. True, the music was similar, but if you listen the words, you'll realize that there's much more going on than the music lets on. Their music has always been a little disturbing to most of their fans, and with this offering they finally figure that out themselves. This CD is amazing. I gave it 4 stars because I rarely give anything 5. This CD is usually what I turn to on miserable days."
5,Great as gifts!,"Vintage, retro, and classy, as always, by Bon Appetit. The 4 booklets come in a case. Classic, recommended."
2,You are making a MISTAKE!,"Not a good product. Recommend Sony products. This product produces ok surround sound and ok stereo sound. But the subwoofer on this item is a joke. The subwoofer face fell off as i was taking it out of the box, and it produces a distorted sound that i dont think anyone would enjoy."
1,not good,"I bought the 4"" x 6"" photo paper and found it had a perforated tab.What's this dumb tab for? I can't get it to come off clean.Before the HP paper I used Canon and Canon is far better!I'll never buy HP again."
4,Photo Paper,I've found the HP Premium Photo Paper to be very easy to use and it allows me to produce good quality photos from my computer photo albums.
1,Why perforate at all?,"I have used many photo papers over time, and only a few of them have the weird perforated tab you have to remove after you print. It didn't bother me because I needed printer paper, and EVERY OTHER brand I have ever used tore off cleanly. Not this paper. 8 out of 10 pictures I print tear on one side. Easy to cut off, but very irritating, and it does affect the look of the picture as it looks like cheap paper. The tab is useless, and causes more harm than good. I can't wait to be out of this paper so I can buy the superior Kodak that I prefer to use."
1,Produces mottled prints with Canon Pixma printers,"I own a high end Canon Pixma Pro 9000 photo printer. I bought a bunch of HP Premium photo paper because it was 2 for 1. Big mistake. The prints had a mottled pattern which was quite ugly. I thought my printer must have clogged jets because the print quality was so low. I cleaned my print heads and tested the alignment, but I kept getting same lousy quality. So I got on the phone with Canon tech support which immediately suspected the HP paper (apparently HP papers are a known problem). They had me print the same photo on Kodak paper I also happened to have on hand and it was beautiful. The Canon tech support person told me that HP, unlike most of the other manufacturers use a different process with the result the paper surface will swell as the ink is applied to it causing image problems. I think the problem occurs with ink formulations which have water in them, but not 100% sure.No more HP paper for me."
1,Will Not Print Correctly on HP Printers,"I have an HP Photosmart C7280 printer that will not work with this photo paper. There is a code on the back of the paper that is used for the ""Auto Sense"" feature. This is designed so the printer can recognize which direction the paper is loaded (in case you loaded some sheets the wrong way). Unfortunately, it is more of a problem than a help. No matter how the settings are changed on the printer, it will always print on the perforated tab and leave a blank bar at the end of the picture. I spend about an hour with tech support and they could not get the issue resolved. I strongly recommend against this product. Purchase photo paper that does not have the tab on it."
3,"Decent printing, especially when on sale!","Amazon recently had this item on sale for $6.99 ... which is a good price for 100 sheets compared to other brands I use (Canon, Epson, Kodak). The paper printed fine on my Epson R1800 printer. I'd hoped to buy more, but I see the price is now higher. The paper isn't quite as heavy as the Canon or Epson or Kodak papers, but they run about double the $6.99 price. I had no trouble with smearing or ink not acting properly. I use the HP paper for 'routine' or snapshot type prints or proofs of my RAW processing before printing in larger sizes."
1,huge decrease in quality from former paper,"I bought a large quntity of this paper not realizing there had been a huge change in ""premium plus"". The quality of the prints are not usable for my work now. I called HP and asked if there was any of the old paper I could buy and was told they would ship some to me. They shipped about 15 sheets of the ""advanced"" type, not Premium Plus. Very dissatisfied and must find other paper to use now. No one seemed to care at HP."
2,"This is 4x6.5"" with a perforated edge!","WARNING: The paper is nice but it is actually 4x6.5"" with one of the short edges having a perforated tab.This was not shown in the screenshot and I am really disappointed in my purchase since I was misled into thinking this was a normal 4x6"" sheet with no tabs or preforated edges."
2,"White dots on HP Premium Paper, Glossy","I also encountered the white dot problem with HP Premium glossy photo paper on my HP PSC 2355 printer. I even changed my printers at Best Buy, thinking that I have a defective printer, but still the same result. The pictures look good, but the white dots are quite annoying. They are virtualy imperceptible on lighter colors, but are glaring on dark colors, especially black. I would not recommend using this paper if you have an HP printer similar to mine (2355, 2175, 1315, 1350, etc.). Premium PLUS paper indeed corrects this problem, but it is almost twice as expensive. (If one looks very intently the white dots are still present even on Premium plus paper, they are just not conspicuous.) Because of this, I am now thinking of returning my HP printer, even thought the overall picture quality, as well as the product reliability, is quite high."
3,Why The Tear-off Tab?,"Other brands of photo paper and even the trial suppy provided with my HP printer were 4 X 6 and printed as expected. I didn't realize that my latest purchase of HP photo paper had a perforated tab until I noticed the stack of borderless photos I had just printed were white on the edge. Not the perforated edge! So, I looked into it and discovered that a tab was intended to ease handling of the wet prints. I then inserted the paper with the edge facing out(tear off tab outside the printed area of the paper). But the tear off tab was not presented after printing - it was positioned deep in the output tray where it was inaccesible. After tearing away the perforated tab, several photos retained jagged edges where the tab did not separate cleanly."
1,Boring Photos,"The photos did not inspire me at all. Too many individual plant pics, too many boring or small pics. Better to just get a free plant catalogue."
3,Rent it,"Not a bad game, lots of cool effects and interaction. The shooter perspective gets a little dicey in tight spaces, tough to shoot foes from corners. Rent it first."
3,Meh,"After many serious attempts to play this game and give it a chance to suck me in, I ended up selling this game. It was OK... not terrible and not great, just OK. There are too many great games out there to justify spending any more time with Cold Fear. Maybe it was just not my cup of tea, maybe others enjoyed it much more than I did. Meh."
3,not that happy,"The product was purchased at a great price and delivered on time, but when I received it, it looked like it had been a display model for 10 years. the box was slighly worn and some of the perfume had evaporated. I would not had cared myself because the price was so good, but It was a christmas gift, I would rather pay a little more and know I'm getting a better product."
4,"Fun, Entertaining Read","In If Cooks Could Kill, Joanne Pence continues the story of Angie Amalfi and her love interest, Inspector Paavo Smith.

4,The Most Precious Gifgt,"I read this most sensitive book about the lives of both a brother who donated his kidney and his sister who was the recepient. The book reveals how the transplant effected both of their lives. This is a timely book since there are many more transplants today than when they went thru their ordeal. The book should be read by those who are about to be a donor, and those who will be a recepient. In addition it should be read by any close relatives and friends. There are many sensitive,revealing and beautiful passages The book was well written by Mr Liebling and is easy to read.."
3,Was there an end?,"I like her books, but I seem to have missed the end of this one. It was an interesting concept, and her love scenes are usually pretty good, but once the extremely long love scene ended, I was ready for the storyline to continue. I was really shocked to find the book ended at that point. What happened? I really don't think it was worth the price."
2,Disappointing,"I was quite excited when I first started reading this book, I thought I'd come across an author as good as JR Ward - how wrong I was. After the first few good pages the main couple start having sex and that's it. No story, just sex. The sex wasn't that hot, there was no tenderness between the couple and without a good story became boring. And, the ring was just yuck. Books like these are 10 a penny, I was gutted because there was the promise of a really good book in the first chapter. If you want a good read try JR Ward or Sandy Blair or Julie Garwood or Sherrilyn Kenyon."
4,Incredibly descriptive story of murder set in Ireland,"This novel really gives the reader a feeling of being in Ireland, touching a bit of their unique culture. Combine that with the suspense of trying to figure out this ""Who done it"" makes it a great read!"
1,2 big problems in under 8 months,"I don't use it for more than one dvd every day or two, but after a couple of months it started making a terrible noise. Its fan was sticking and stopping, which caused the player to turn off. I oiled the fan and it worked for a few more months, untill the ""f61"" error. Now the machine wil turn on for only one second and then turn itself off.It was easy to use and good for movies, not loud enough for music. I think the player is ready for the trash now in under a year. Too many people on the web blogs are getting the f61 (your machine is dead) error."
1,Broken out of the box,"After reviewing CNET and CONSUMER REPORTS for their recommendations, I settled on the Panasonic SC-HT440 Home Theater System. I followed the set up instructions and kept getting an error code. I called Panasonic Customer Support whom refered me to Universal Electronic for repair! After a month in the repair facility, they had to replace the fan unit on it. I will look at Sony for my next purchase."
4,sounds very nice.,We are very satisfied with this system-it sounds very nice and is rather inexpensive compared to others.
5,GREAT Magazine,"I LOVE Cooks Country. An unusual and really useful as well as a very attractive and interesting magazine. I have even given it as gifts,The price was much better than through the inserts in the magazine itself, too."
1,"If you buy, what your renewal dates.","I purchased Cook's Country and Cook's Illustrated and while I enjoyed that magazine, they seem very dishonest. I would get a renewal notice months before my subscription was due. When I complained about not getting my full subscription, they tried to tell me I got my subscription in Aug/Sept of 2011, I didn't pay until Feb of 2012. Now it's July 2012 and they are saying my subscription is over. I told them to cancel it; I am not giving them money for magazines I will never receive. They told me to accept any magazine I might receive with their complements. Are they kidding? I paid for every magazine I ever received. They are so insulting. I should be getting magazines until the end of the year. But they are canceling me early because I refuse to pay for magazines I never received."
5,Awesome and Practical,Simply explained. Helps you figure out the 'why' of cooking so you can create your own recipes or just follow the excellent recipes they have. Doesn't use hard to find ingredients and lists substitutions.
4,Cook's Country in print,"I have enjoyed seeing episodes of Cook's Country on television. This magazine replicates that series in print. One modest plus: there is no advertising!As with the TV series, there are a couple features that would be familiar: equipment review; taste test (one of the best tasting brands is the one that I use!!). Some other nice features: kitchen shortcuts (such as keeping marshmallows fresh); Ask Cook's Country (e.g.,What's the best way to grease a Bundt pan?)' Cooking for two (in the issue I'm looking at--pulled pork for two, a yummy looking recipe); Slow cooker recipes; etc.The heart of the issue, though, is recipes. Recipe cards--with a picture of the dish on the one side and the recipe on the other--make up a good portion of this volume.And so on. Anyone familiar with the TV series will feel comfortable and right at home with this magazine!"
1,For the nostalgic person,"I am a long time subscriber to Cooks Illustrated and love it - so I tried this. I think it's a waste of money. Too many glossy recipe cards (where are the environmentalists on that staff???) and the size is too large for my collection of standard size cooking magazines. The consumer articles are on kitchen sponges vs. the real cooking equipment you find in Cooks Illustrated. Skip it. I had hoped for something that did good meals for families and find a glossy thingy that seems entirely aimed at the nostalgia market. There are numerous better choices, including the fine Cooks Illustrated, Cooking Light or Fine Cooking."
1,Poorly Illustrated and Difficult to Follow,There are simply better country cookbooks available. This one offers nothing new to a country cook with modest experience.
5,A cheap brick collection,This collection consists of the same DVDs from the entire 4 volumes of the MS Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory series. This is a brick package - a thick multi-disc keepcase. The initial batch contains a limited edition foil art cover.
2,Inferior to the original Mobile Suit and Zeta Gundam.,"Being new to gundam, I decided to start from the begining: Mobile Suit Gundam. After watching(and enjoying)the original movie trilogy, I decided to watch this series before moving on to Zeta Gundam. This way I would be watching them in order of the timeline. Anyway, I found this series difficult to get through. Cheesy, one dimensional characters with a weak hero(He cries often), and juvenile story-telling. This series ranks FAR below the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and just as far below Zeta Gundam. The animation is better because it is newer, but that is about it. I could barely finish the last disc. The positive reviews here are misleading, in my opinion...Oh, and why are all of the explosions pink?"
2,OK,"Ok I bought this product after reading the reviews which most are 4-5 stars. All I have to say is most of the other people on here are seriously deprived when it comes to a good story line at within a series. While the action is ok it is a far cry from top notch and the storyline I would call immature at best. I was generally bored watching this and basically watched the whole series out of sheer curiosity on whether it would get any better, I was seriously disappointed. Damn why couldnt have Bandai messed up the discs on this series like they have done on the other ones? At least I wouldnt have wasted my time watching the rest of the series. Anyway save your money on this one."
2,bad product,"ok first id like to say gundam 0083 is a good show to the gundam series. when getting this product in the mail i was excited to watch it i got to the fourth disc to find out that the same episodes on dick 1 are on disc 4 too. so i didnt get to see the last three episodes. disc 1 has four episodes, disc 2 has three episodes, disc 3 has three episodes, disc 4 has three episodes but my disc 4 had four episodes on it . i found out that episode 1-4 was on disc 1 and 4 someone didnt copy the right episodes on the right disc. this problem need to get fixed asap. i think the product needs a recall or a release with no dvd problems. also i didnt get a refund :("
1,amazon should be ashmed to sell this,"this cd is a sham and amazon ought to be ashmaed of itself when you punch in ktel original hits by original artists this comes up and they are not the original hits,I wonder how many people buy this and do not even notice the difference."
3,This CD is good considering how long ago the songs were.,"This CD quality is pretty good considering the songs were made in the 1960's. Even though the songs were not in their ""original version""; what songs really are? The same lyrics, tunes, etc were all there and it had me singing!!!I would recommend this to anyone who likes the ""Golden Oldies""."
5,Energizer Eveready 02141-539 6 vol J Size Alkaline Battery,This battery was the perfect size for my remote control for my television. I am very pleased I purchased two so I have a spare.
3,Not His Best Collection,"The highlight on this one is the uptempo rockabilly tune, ""Under the Hood"". The soft, mid-tempo ""How's My World Treating You"" is also very good, & ""Time For Letting Go"" sounds very similar. The collection also includes the radio hit, ""Busy Man"". ""Rock This Planet"" is a pretty standard 50's-style rockabilly tune. ""Touchy Subject"" is a pretty good bluesy rocker. The rest are so-so ballads. I think STORM IN THE HEARTLAND (if you can find it) is easily his best album so far."
1,Boring and Typical,"There is nothing about this album that distingushes it from the rest of the pack. The new single ""Busy Man"" could have been sung by anyone and when I first heard it I didn't know who it was. The songs are mediocre and I don't recommen this album."
5,shot full of love,my daughter and i met Billy Ray at a local store ! He is the greatest man you would ever want to meet .He was very nice to all of his fans! To my Daughter and me there is only one singer who we have all of his cds and that is Billy Ray Cyrus keep up the good work and God Bless you and your family we love you Billy Ray! you cant go wrong purchasing this or any of Billy Ray's cds ..we love you thanks Mary and Hope
4,BRC is Back,"Well, although I wouldn't call this Billy Ray's ""comeback"" album, it certainly shows some evolution in his sound. True country fans, look somewhere else, but BRC fans, this is the place to turn. With tons of novelty BRC songs like the opening track, you'll find that his song choice hasn't changed much. However, he puts his heart and soul into singing these songs, and his voice has matured greatly from the days of ""Achy Breaky."" The sound he opts for is more of a ""Storm in the Heartland,"" and it works. With obvious style flair like on the not-even-close-to-country rocking title track and the swinging, shades-of-Setzer ""Rock This Planet,"" it is indeed a fun album. But comeback? No. His true comeback is Southern Rain. I recommend both for the true BRC fan."
5,shot full of love-easy on the ears,"This is one of my favorite collections of his songs- Hows my world treating you, you gotta love it, the lyrics alone are such that we all can relate to having been there and wish we could have put it so elequently. Billys has the ability to vary his vocals according to the theme of every song he sings- and then change the tempo and still make it sound completely different yet equally appealing. The man speaks and it sounds like music to my ears."
2,chrono buttons a problem,"The buttons that operate the chrono have been very difficult to operate. Have a tendency to stick after which they will activate inconsistently. The watch is nice to look at, but overall a big disappointment because of the chrono."
4,Great Watch!,This is a fantastic product with a very beautiful style. The watchband fits in any arm. It is weightless and has many features for people who use the chronometer! I'm rating this product with 4 stars because the watch doesn't have the backlight. It is not a good watch to use at night.
4,"Excellent Reference. Theory, helpful figures, some apps.","An excellent reference. This text provides a comprehensive review of the subject, stressing the theory and limitations of operations.Sometimes it reads like the cart is beore the horse, but with a little patience everything becomes clear."
3,British authors and research,The topic of this book is of interest to me but the vast majority of the material has quite a British slant to it. The author makes some very good points..one being that we have developed many intuitive programs to help children learn money responsibilities but unlike other areas of development have done no research to see which kinds of parent teaching methods are most effective. The writing is broad in spectrum but I must admit I found my interest waning with the studies of pocket money in British children. Also I felt some of the material was a bit dated but I must give them credit for producing a well researched book on the topic. Now if only some US psychologists would write a comprehensive review of the topic. Dr. Mary Gresham Atlanta Ga
1,Not for Linux,"I got this card to run under a Linux system and ATI's support for Linux is pretty poor. Have had LOTS of troubles trying to get it configured and working and the ""Linux tools"" that are supplied by ATI for it are undocumented and difficult to understand. I strongly recommend not buying ATI cards for Linux systems, nVidia is far better supported."
5,"Great product, great price","After installing into my computer, this card has made a huge difference in the quality of my online gaming experience. I would recommend this product to anyone. I have an older computer and wasn't sure if it would fit but it does. It's a great card and great price."
4,Thougths after over a year using...,"I had originally tried a cheeper ati card, the 1300 i believe, which had worked fine with games but my benchmark was the visualizer on itunes at high resolution. The 1600 has enough power to display the complex animations without skipping frames most of the time at 1280X1024. (My pc is an hp p4 3 gig machine). I had also discovered later that if i wanted to upgrade to a 30"" monitor i could because this card has two video outputs, a definate bonus.The only drawbacks i have found are that the fan goes on high when playing games, and have had a crash from the video card, once maybe every 6 months. I have a feeling it is related to my fiddling with the settings for overclocking the chip in the software that is given. I don't recommend overclocking the video card for that reason and to ati's credit they do warn of some possible problems by overclocking it."
2,Not for gaming,"To be a 512 mb ATI, I am very disappointed. I have to play with low graphics. It seems Nvidia has better graphics cards."
5,Are these tracks right?,"I own a vinyl copy of this album and none of the songs listed are on my album, and none of the songs on my album are listed.Is this info correct?"
4,Its Grease What can I say,No problems but what do you say about grease? I used it it worked fine looks and feels like grease
5,Perfect,Perfect for my Legacy L1305 Workforce Mini Grease Gun for 3 Oz Cartridges.. Just the right size for my needs.
3,OK Grease Cartridge,"I purchased this 2-pack of cartridges to use with a mini-grease gun. The cartridges are 6"" long and contain 4 1/2"" of grease. They fit into my mini-grease gun perfectly. I have no idea where this grease originated. The container indicates that it is distributed by an outfit in St. Louis but the origin is not disclosed. For this reason I will not buy anymore of these when the grease runs out. I prefer to do business with companies that do not hide information. I try to avoid purchases from countries that include harmful chemicals in their products. Hiding information is the main reason for the 3 star rating.The one helpful aid that could be provided is a pull-tab to pull out the covering over the grease so that is will flow into the gun. The way it is set up now is to poke a hole into the covering and then try to find it and fish it out of the spurting grease. A simple pull-tab would make this a much easier task. It is no big thing but just a helpful hint."
5,awesome,Awesome if ur a wresting fan from start to finish. Will keep you keep you very busy for awhile.
5,Wrestling Must Have!,"This DVD is another example of how the WWF (not WWE!) is bring back classic wrestling to long time fans. This DVD chronicals the history of the Road Warriors from their beginnings to end. It is great to see the real inside information on the team straight from Animal, Paul Ellering and others close to them. A great DVD! The only thing I would have like to see more of is the TBS interviews and the time they jumped Dusty Rhoades and put the spike in his eye."
5,"Oooooh, What A Rush!","The interviews are insightful and informing. Animal talks about Hawk and all their great memories together in the business. Recommended for anyone who became a fan in the 80's and 90's.DVD contains tons of extras (too many to list) on both discs... all the way from NWA, AWA, WCW, to WWE."
5,wow its all here,THIS IS A MUST FOR ANT WRESTLING FAN OR ROAD WARRIORS FAN IAM ON THE 7TH HOUR AND CAN NOT PULL MYSELF AWAY IAM AM IN WRESTLING DVDNIRVANA
2,What a dissapointment!,DVD was long and boring.Put a better tag team on dvd like Kane and The Undertaker or DX or The Rock and Mankind.Not no dumb Road Warriors who are as extinct as Jim Ross or The King.
5,Excellent Memoir,"This is a wonderful collection of the history of the Road Warriors. There is so much information that the average fan doesn't know just from watching them in the WWE. This was great first-hand accounts from Animal about his relationship with his partner, how they met, where they worked out, their rise and ultimate fall from glory. EXCELLENT!!!V/RVictoria"
4,Good dvd,I bought this because a friend told me it was good. This was a great video. I love the road warriors and was sad to see them go. But this helped me relive those great moments. Good for any wrestling fan.
4,One of the Greatest Tag Teams!,This is an amazing DVD that chronicles the History of the Wretling Tag Team The Legion of Doom. It goes all the way back from when they were fist training till the last match that they had in the WWE. Some of the Best matches are a part of this collection. Anyone who is a fan of Pro-Wrestling will enjoy this dvd. WHAT A RUSH!!!
2,Bummer!,"Just purchased this printer with high expectations. I didn't realize that it cannot be used directly with my Flash Memory Card. Only works directly with a Memory Stick. I hooked it up to my PC and the print quality was bad, nowhere near the quality I currently get at a photo lab. Oh well!"
1,"Best photo printer ever made, but BEWARE - Sony no longer manufactures or sells the ribbons","Sony created a fantastic printer. The results are even better than the typical local chain drug store's services. However, Sony has DROPPED THE BALL and will no longer supply printer paper and their proprietary SVM series ribbons, so anyone with a printer of this series now owns a very expensive paperweight. Consequently, I recommend that nobody buy the new printer advertised here. Only Sony's proprietary ribbons and paper will work in the unit. I think we should flood Sony with angry calls, so they make the supplies available. Their number is 212-833-8000. Press 3 to dial by name, and key in ""Stringer"" (Howard Stringer is the President of Sony). Unfortunately, they will connect you to their Customer Relations team in Fort Myers, FL, but if they get enough complaints, maybe they will do something about it."
4,Good reading for a MiG fanatic,"I bought this book a long time ago..over 10 years ago. What I loved most was the wealth of technical data about the MiG-21, 23 and 25 along with a very insightful first chapter on the history of the Mikoyan design bureau and the dynamics that go behind Russian fighter design.The chapters on the MiG-29 and 31 were understandably sketchy as at that time, info about these fighters was hazy, but Sweetman does a great job of analyzing the imperatives behind the new generation fighters- the MiG-29 becasue the MiG-23 was completely outmatched by the F-15/18 and the MiG-31 to counter the B-1/cruise missile threat.The one piece I found lacking was more combat info , especially on the Fishbed, which has fought in most major wars, and done pretty well over Vietnam and India. Other than that, a first rate acquisition!"
5,Enlightening!,"Ira Israel presents a natural treatment for depression and anxiety that rejects the pharmaceutical approach to these all too common modern day afflictions. Ira is highly qualified and knowledgeable on the subject and presents clinical information in an interesting and understandable way. The video is beautiful to watch, and Ira's narrative is both instructional and inspiring. Yoga devotees and novices alike will find great value here. You will watch this video again and again. I am a fan."
5,The best film about depression and how to help it that I've seen.,"I love this video. It is clear and concise, explaining how the minds workings can cause depression especially when living in big urban centers. I've done a lot of reading on this subject and it gave me a lot of food for thought. It gives us easy tools that we can use to alleviate our suffering and it is beautifully shot all over the world including actual meditations in real time. I was very impressed with the quality of this video and the content presented in it. I highly recommend this for anyone who is experiencing depression or just wants to calm the mind. Watch the movie and see how you feel afterwards, it really has a calming and balancing effect."
1,"Some interesting points, but not useful overall","The speaker appears to have the impression that depression is just sadness that you can get over by thinking happy thoughts. Anyone who has ever truly suffered from depression, especially long-term depression, can tell you that this simply isn't the case. While he does raise some valid issues, for the most part, his arguments are both facile and specious.That being said, the videography in the various cities was quite pleasant. The audio, in contrast, was poor. Also, nearly half the video consists of shots of the speaker meditating. Really? They thought that was necessary?"
5,Life-changing!,"As a doctor, I recommend this DVD to all my patients! It helped me find peace in such a powerful way, that I don't want to miss any opportunity to share it with others. The tools in this DVD so accessible and profound, that even the simplest effort of using them will provide immediate relief from stressful living! Beyond this, a more dedicated application of Ira Israel's method will carve a path that is nothing short of life-changing. I have experienced this myself and have witnessed it in my own patients."
5,Fresh Context = New Meaning + Invigorating Action,"What makes this a stand-out? Narrator Ira Israel is friendly, informed and poised as he leads an elegant how-to session on meditation and mindfulness. This DVD communicates with words and action: the narrator shows his perspective by sitting, with an easy smile, against an attractive, but hectic, panorama of beloved cityscapes. So many mindfulness videos feature a friendly face in a gorgeous environment -- believe me, I'd feel mellow if I were in Hawaii, too! But here I sit, close to a belching bus, keeping a vexing schedule. I'm trying to keep my cool before I hit that hamster wheel of negativity. Ira Israel promotes the idea that the oasis comes from within, and he offers tools and inquiries that summon a better frame in contemporary, ""real life"", settings. A lovely DVD, well worth it!"
4,Insight and reflection even for the neophyte,"I watched the dvd twice so far. I bought it because I was intrigued by the title. First time I watched it for walk-around to get the feeling of it and second time to absorb the contents.It helped me ""see"" and take a step back and actually start thinking about making small changes by giving myself an opportunity to learn and take time anywhere, I realize it will take me some years to reach Ira Israel's level of comfort but have great hopes, one step at a time (am a working mum of two young active boys). Just having to pause and relax the body whilst breathing, something silly but so essential that ocI now feel I have a tool that I look forward to using and practice.I enjoyed the lovely city settings and recognized a few of them of course, but the variety reminded me of all those mini moments in any city dweller's daily life !I am looking forward to sahring this dvd with some likeminded friends in need of a pause and reflection in their busy life."
3,New respect for rape victims,"I thought this was a very well written book. So many times I've read books with fairy tale endings that I've come to expect it. Truly for Gwen I wanted a fairy tale ending. This book showed me that when you have been raped it's more than just one night, it affects you the rest of your life. I pulled for Gwen and Xavier, but they had too much to overcome. Rape affects everyone around you. It sabatoged every relationship Gwen had. Xavier paid the ultimate price for something he had no control over, he had my sympathy as well."
2,Personal Health Products,"Ordered Fixodent Extra Hold ..got Fixodent Regular Hold[[ASIN:B000FKJQ1O Fixodent Denture Adhesive Powder, Extra Hold, 2.7-Ounce Box"
1,What a load of pogey bait,"As a Marine I find this book totally insulting, inaccurate and in Gyrene lingo: "" a boat load of pogey bait"". If James Brady was in fact a Marine he must have spent a great portion of his service time in the slop chute contriving ideas for a book that only lifetime civilians should be allowed to read. I'm never in favor of banning books but this is one I'll concede to the book bonfire. Save your money and read a comic book."
2,Hard Drive review,"This is the same hard drive that comes with a gen3 i-pod. If you are like me your old drive started skipping (made a clicking noise)and ceased to play music and you are trying to replace it. After ordering this drive and installing it into my ipod the music played perfectly. Then after a week or so the same problem happened again, that darn clicking noise. I know several people who have the same ipod as me that have had the same exact problem. The only thing that I can attribute it to is that it is a design flaw in the hard drive. It is obviously not rugged enough to handle the regular wear and tear of normal ipod usage. If I were going do it all again I would buy an ipod with flash memory and leave hard drives to desktop computers. Hard drives are just not meant to travel."
5,Doesn't irritate the stomach at all!,"We added this supplement to our Doberman's diet after he was diagnosed with bone cancer as a way to boost his immune system a bit. I started taking it too at the same time. No clue if it's really helping him in any way, but I haven't had any ill effects from taking it and I did manage to resist getting a rather ugly cold everyone else around us got two weeks ago. We've been taking this now for about 6 weeks. The main thing is neither of us have had any stomach issues with this product."
3,Ok,Couldn't tell much of a difference while using this product. Overall fair value for the amount of product you get for your money.
4,Really good coffee for the patient,"Bad points first. First, you can't wash the Chemex with the wood handle in the dishwasher. Fortunately, Chemex has come out with a glass handled one that you can. You can buy it direct from the Chemex web site if Amazon doesn't sell it.Second, you have to stand around and feed boiling water cup by cup into the Chemex. Modern drip coffee makers will do the same thing for you.That said, the filters are excellent, and the Chemex pot is beautiful. Simple, elegant, and it really does make very fine coffee in the American style, without the bitterness of French press. An excellent gift for coffee freaks."
3,Great Coffee but Can't do a Proper Pour,I insert the filters properly but when I pour hot water a seal forms preventing air from escaping so it kind of burps air as it fills. This causes coffee to spill out the top between the glass and the filter. I have to lift the filter up a bit by the edges to allow the air to escape. A real pain. I don't see others complain about this so maybe I'm doing something wrong. I use the approved filter and make sure the layered side faces the air vent but it still seals up.
5,Gorgeous & Delicious,Ordered this a few weeks ago and it's fantastic! Beautiful to look at when not in use and the brewing process is very simple. The filter really takes all the bitterness out and makes a really smooth cup of coffee. It's a bit hard to clean without a bottle-cleaner style spongewand but that's easy to find. I live in a small apartment in NYC and didn't have enough space for an electric coffee maker -- so this is perfect!
2,It's basically a massively overpriced Melitta drip cup,"I'll admit it, I was taken in by all of the reviews about how this thing makes the most awesome coffee ever, changes your life and leads straight to total enlightenment. It's basically a very expensive glass vase that makes coffee the same way as those little plastic Melitta drip cups. The coffee tastes the same as coffee made with the little Melitta drip cups. Maybe it's my unrefined palate, but I failed to achieve enlightenment, or better coffee. Get the little plastic one that sits on top of a coffee cup and have the same coffee for 35 bucks less."
3,"long wait, but good","The chemex coffee maker provides good coffee, but the procedure is long. Boil water first, add to coffee pot, wait and wait and wait.That is why I gave it a 3 star. Plus I microwave it in my cup to make it hot enough...Still searching for the best coffee pot."
1,Great....if you like a mild coffee,I bought this item because of it's beauty (I bought the hand blown model...$78). I like a flavorful stronger brew (somewhat like Starbuck bold). This coffee maker produces a milder brew because the hot water does not brew in the coffee beans long enough to produce the rich flavor that I prefer. After one use I went back to my French Press which produces a much better cup of coffee.
1,I could have bought the a 10-cup for the same price,"This purchased turned into a real cluster. I purchased the 8-cup @ around $38 bucks, and right after I received the coffee maker I received an email from the Amazon supplier that my same coffee maker was now $30 bucks, and that the 10-cup model was $38 ! I would have rather had the 10-cup model instead but sure as heck didn't want to go thru the hassle and time to repackage, resend the 8 cup-er.This was just a hassle. Yes, the difference was credited to my credit card, but ultimately thats not what I wanted knowing that I would have had the larger pot."
5,Very impressed,"We decided to switch to a non-electric coffee maker. We wanted something that didn't require electricity and wasn't metal. I found a few reviews for Chemex and decided that we would try it. It is sturdy and well made. For the first couple of days I used two regular coffee filters with my Chemex. They did work but the coffee flow was much faster but I can't say the coffee tasted awful, it was still good. The biggest advantage with the Chemex filters is that they are very large so can hold the wet coffee without tearing. Overall I am very happy with my Chemex coffee maker and wish I had switched years ago. My husband and I each have a 12 oz cup of coffee every morning. The 8 cup coffee maker is just the right size with a little coffee left over."
4,no frills coffee making,the coffee it makes is pretty good.. I admit i miss a line on a coffee pot telling me where 40 ounces of water is so I can pour it into the kettle to boil.. I like conventional handles.. I like a lid that fits and does not burn me when I pour coffee.I feel like a fool paying extra for the lid...and do not dare keeping coffee in the pot without a lid; it is cold in 25 seconds.... I think I miss my melitta coffee pot from 25 years ago..did you see the accesory for $50 that is a long spouted kettle to pour your coffee whose capacity bears no relationship to the capacity of this pot. so you have to boil water 2 times ( but measure carefully each time ) in order to make 40 ounces of coffee.. my goodness..
5,Best Coffee Made Easy!!!,"Keeping this review short because there are many others here, the coffee comes out tasting great and I had success the first time and every time as the instructions are simple enough. The only bad part is if you decide on getting the glass lid for this pot I have to warn you that it really doesn't do the job of keeping the warmth inside as the steam simple escapes from the larger than 1/4 of an inch contour that is part of the pouring spout that runs the length from the neck of the glass to the top rim. Instead of making the lid round, it should have been shaped to cover the groove where the pouring spout is on the container. Still the lid is a nice added design to the overall product. Can't complain too much as I am hooked on this coffee maker and enjoy the coffee making process as well."
5,coffee at its best,Bought Chemex 8 cup carafe at the recommendation of my son.Have never looked back.Coffee tastes better than ever and gadget easy to clean.Its our#1 coffeemaker and we have tried them all!
5,"Simple, efficient, and clean coffee every time.","I have been using this product for about a week now and I absolutely love it. I use the 8 cup to fill up my 20oz. mug, and it is the perfect size. The carafe has volume to spare, but you would have to continue to pour water into it. This would be relatively inconvenient for larger groups. However, if you know how to boil water, you know how to make great coffee."
4,Best coffee maker,Great product for the best tasting coffee ever! I have been buying Chemex for years! Filters too are the best.
3,Good but too much work,"One of the best cups of coffee I ever had was brewed in one of these and the simplicity of this method is very appealing, but after several weeks of experimentation I've concluded that the beans, grind, and freshness are more important than the method. It's not so much that you have to wait for the water to drip through the filter, but that you have to stand over it waiting for the level to drop down while you keep pouring the hot water. To my taste, the french press is just as good and does not require the extra work.It also seems a bit excessive to pay ten bucks for the glass stopper and that the filters are so much more expensive. The hassle level of keeping this clean should also be considered."
5,A Very Good Book,I for one have enjoyed this book for many years. I find the whole plot to be very enjoyable as well as imformative. It gives some information on how to survive and what to do in certain situations. Plus some of the stuff in this book was pretty funny.I highly recommend this book.
3,Good Value for the $,"All Fobus Holsters are of good quality and will secure a handgun well. You can adjust the draw tension through the use of two screws on this side. This holster is NOT suitable for concealed carry....it sits too far away from the body, but for open carry of range use it is excellent. I have used one on my last two deployments for carrying a Baretta M-9 (Model 92F) aroind the FOB. I have not used it ""outside the wire""....a thigh holster fits the bill for that task. Overall a decent holster for it's intended use."
4,Works well,This is the first Fobus holster I have purchased and it does a good job holding the firearm in place.
3,Not A Book For Beginners,This book has been painstakingly researched and offers an unbelievable amount of information but if you are a fabric beginner this book is very hard to use. There is no glossery of terms and if you are not familiar with the vocabulary of fabric it is hard to decipher the information. I have read the book through once and as a beginner I am frustrated because I do not know enough about the subject to understand what is being presented.I am sure that this is book has a lot of information to offer but not to a person who is new to the subject.
3,Vintage Fabrics Identification & Value Guide,"Book was very complete in identifying fabrics, but it isn't set up for a quite check of fabrics."
5,Great computer network cable.,I bought this cable to connect my upstairs computer to my cable modem and router located in the basement of my house and it works great. Can't beat the quality for the price.
4,Great Value For The Price!,"Excellent drill - battery life is great, battery meter is pretty accurate and the recharge is very quick. This drill is made very well/sturdy and so as others have noted, it is a bit heavier than some other drills (my last cordless was a Skil Xdrive, which was much lighter). Case is large but also made well and has room for some small tools. Ability to switch battery location is a nice feature when working in tight spaces. And finally, on-drill storage for two bits is handy... which there was room for a few more."
5,Very nice product,I have had the Milwaukee for a little over a month now and really like how the lithium ion battery holds a charge. I had been looking for a hammer drill for awhile and you can't beat the price. I have already used it on a couple of project and it buzzed right through the concrete with no problem. I would recommend this to anyone.
5,Worth the extra $,"I love this drill. My recommendation for anyone thinking of saving a hundred bucks by buying a girly-man drill is to invest in this machine - you won't regret it. I almost bought the ""highly rated"" Panasonic or something and kept seeing people compare it to this beast, so I decided to just bite the bullet and get a real tool.I like all the extra touches designed to NOT irritate you, like the extra big case you can just throw screw and bits in, without any problem getting the drill in too. I didn't even know about the high-speed button until drilling on some masonry, hit the switch, put it on hammer drill, and it ate through like butter.Yeah, it's loud - duh. Get this and never have to get another drill."
5,Great Drill/Driver,"I have been very satisfied with this drill/driver and love the battery feature that allows you to touch a button to see how much power is left. I also appreciate the area on the handle for storing 2 bits. It was nice of the company to build a plug adapter into the plug itself, thereby allowing you to plug 3 items into a dual receptacle box. Good weight, and nice size battery that is reversable on the drill. The V18 Lithium-Ion battery is compatable with all my V18 Nicad Milwaukee cordless tools from a previous contractor kit. The drill's shell is part metal and part plastic, which appears to be able to with stand more injury then their previous NiCad model. The drill has a very good clutch system with numbered increments. I bought this after my NiCad batteries ran out of juice and a tool technician warned against the 24V model, saying that the 24V batteries are to powerful for the drill's motor. I have no complaints with the output of this 18V model. So, great tool overall."
5,A good book for its time,"Well back in the day when pokemon was popular and everyone and their moms was collecting, being interseted in the craze myself I bought this to know more about how the game is played etc. I read this book when I was 8 yes the whole thing and I showed off my knoledge this book is a very good book that children should buy back in those days the most important thing that this book taught me was how to trade and not get ripped off something a cousin of mine used to do to other cousins so I was not onw of them, but now the book really has no more use in this time and age but I wish to buy it again in the near futrue"
2,Useless tab & poor quality,"I am very unhappy with the quality of this photo paper. I have used HP, Epson, Canon and Kodak paper with my Canon photo printer in the past several years and never had a problem. The lines are blurry and its just not as glossy as some of the other brands. My biggest complaint is the tab, what is it for?? Another review I just saw said that it is for borderless printing. That doesn't make any sense because all other paper and printers can print on an exact 4x6 paper with no borders and with no problems! I have to fold the photo to perforate the tab and rip it off, which leaves a jagged edge on all of the photos. Not to mention, the printer is set to print 4x6, yet some of the picture prints on the tab and gets ripped off, or leave it there and the photo doesn't fit and has a perforated line through it. Not happy at all."
4,Fine paper for the price,"I picked this paper for general use on myHP Photosmart A646. It's a medium weight, reasonable quality paper, producing results that don't wow, but aren't disappointing either.I prefer the results on HP Advanced Photo Paper, which look more vivid to my eyes-- the unprinted paper also looks a little more uniformly glossy. Neither HP paper is as awestriking as the more expensive Canon papers (matched to my large Canon Pixma 9000).But it's hard to complain at this price, considering that, this ""Premium Glossy"" paper is a good choice. Recommended."
4,Fine so far,"I have yet to use more than a few sheets from the package. Those I have used (in a Kodak ESP-C310 printer, using the associated Kodak software) have produced good-looking, quick-drying prints."
3,Great everyday photo paper,"The paper is a little on the lite side but is as described ""Everyday photo paper"". It is very attractively priced and was ideal for my intended use."
3,Fast shipping...not the greatest paper.,"I was hoping it would be more glossy, but maybe that is not possible? It is acceptable but I will purchase another product next time."
2,Good paper But VERY slow dry time,This paper has a good thickness to it and the colors look good but it takes a ridiculous amount of time to dry. A week it says before you can even put it in a frame!
1,This was terrible,"The paper is fine, i'm sure - but I bought the wrong size! I thought it was 8 x 10"" big."
5,Great product,"I like these photo papers, because I don't waste like I would if I wanted one photo and needed an 8.5 by 11"" piece of photo copy paper."
3,The Book is Average,"As can be summed up from reading the 13 previous reviews, the thought on the pages of this work does not have the power to transcend the illusion, Ramana Maharshi. Read the reviews here, they say ""Ramana is the greatest sage. . .,"" ""Ramana is this, Ramana is that."" Please! Where is the Self freedom that a 5 star work would lead one to? Its not to be found in the interpretation of this thought. In fact after reading this work one is left deeper into the illusion that ""I have learned something from him."" So ""SELF"" is left babbling in its own mind about an illusion known as Ramana. 5 stars for that, I don't think so. I give it 3 stars."
1,Multiple tries...still a no go,"I purchased these exact shades (the double pack) as well as a dora the explorer one by munchkin....they are terrible. The suction cups do not work, the shades are too small so they don't even block the sun out. One of the suction cups was torn, the others were completely flat. I contacted the manufacturer and told them....they had me take pictures and give them numbers off the product. They sent me a replacement Dora and one black replacement instead of two. The dora one is actually sticking (fingers crossed it continues) but the black one will fall off. I wouldn't waste your money...you'll just end up frustrated."
1,Irritating and a waste of money,"I bought these and have still not been able to use them. They absolutely refuse to stick to the windows of the car, and if I do manage to get one up, it just falls within seconds. I fear if I do put them up, they will fall on my baby while I'm driving. This is a waste of money."
1,AWFUL!,I usually do not post reviews but this product is awful and I want to save everyone $8. Avoid. Suction is horrible and it just kept falling. If it was possible I would rate it a zero.
1,Simply doesn't work,"These come in a package of 2 and look nice. I couldn't even get them to stick to the window. I tried everything I knew to try...cleaned the window, cleaned the suction cups, wetted them, pressed harder, pressed lighter...you name it. They simply wouldn't stick. If they don't stick to the dern window they're pointless. I had some previous to these (that my son destroyed) and they were MUCH better. He pulled on those suckers with all his might. He pulled the shade right off but the suction part was still suctioned to the window. Now that's a good product. I'm going to look for those again today. He's old enough to be past pulling them off now. Don't waste your time and money on these."
1,Does not stick to window well,"These are cheap. They don't stick well, and keep sliding. I ended up throwing them away & buying better ones."
1,They don't stick to windows!,"I have been trying to stick these to windows for my baby, but they always fall off, sometime onto my baby in her carseat.I do not recommend them to anyone. They do not work! I wish I could return them."
1,Shade does not stay on window... Useless!,"Fortunately, we purchased this product at walmart so we won't have a problem returning it. These munchkin shades look well made, but will not stay on the window for even a short 20 min car ride. The bottom suctions don't work at all so the shade flops around and my 17 month old can reach the bottom and play with it. What a piece of junk. Had the manufacturer used a higher quality suction cup, this product would be excellent."
1,HORRIBLE window shades,"Not only do the top two suction cups not stick, but the lower suction cup will not stick either. Do NOT waste your money! I washed/cleaned my windows prior to putting the shades up and they fell on my daughter five minutes into our car ride."
1,dangerous,"Many reviewers commend this shade does not stick to the window. Well, I cannot agree more. May I also add one more point - if your infant is not riding in the center backseat but by the window, this shade falls off unexpectly, well, should I say more...... trust me, the weight of this shade is not light, you do not want this to hit your baby."
2,Disappointing,I put them in the center of the window and the sun always seems to peek around them on either side. And now the suction cups have lost suction and will not go back on the window. These are terrible. I'm going to have to buy some more window shades but it will not be these.
1,Very disappointed,"We bought these and had nothing but trouble... sun gets around the sides... the biggest issue is the suction cups which are made of a rigid plastic that doesn't conform and stick well to the window...especially the small ones that are supposed to hold the shade at the bottom when it's rolled out. They have been nothing but trouble... I DID follow the instructions carefully regarding cleaning the window... we've tried everything... wet suction cups, clean with rubbing alcohol, I can't even get them to stay with duct tape! These are going in the trash and we are now looking for an alternative. Also note that the same shade is made with branded characters too such as Dora... buyer beware!"
3,"Product is okay,","They (suctions cups) don't seem to stick well to my windows no matter what I try. I have tried cleaning them several times and even wetting them (even though they say it needs to be dry), but they keep falling. Plus, the rolling mechanism is stiff, maybe because they are new? I would buy something else."
1,Won't Stick!!!,"I bought these shades hoping to protect my little one's eyes. I should have been worried about her head - these dumb things kept falling off the windows and whacking her! I threw them away, what a horrible waste of money!!! The suction cups didn't work from day one, even with a nice clean window. Can I give less than 1 star?? DON'T BUY!"
1,Suction cups do not suction,"Product instructions should read as follows:Step One: Unwrap product.Step Two: Place suction cups onto window and immediately watch the product fall as if tied to a sack of bricks.Step Three: Place brand new product in trash and think about doing proper research before buying a different shade.I threw one away before thinking about what can be done to correct it. Since they came as a two pack, I still have the second one. I am going to Lowes or Home Depot to buy better suction cups and will remove the suction cups on the product for a swap. The product is great, it just doesn't stick to the window. Not even for a minute."
1,They're crap.,"The suction cups suck, suck, SUCK! And not in the good way. The spring recoil is okay (though after a year of off-and-on use one of them is slow to recoil completely), but what good is a shade with good recoil on the floor of your back seat?!?! It's not because they're old, either. They never stayed up well, not even the day we got them. As for the white hot thing, it's not a bad idea, but if you're going to get into the car, you're going to get into the car, thermochemicals be damned. Then you just roll the windows down all the way with no obstructions because the friggin' shades already fell off the window! One more SUCK, just for good measure."
2,Would Work great if worked properly,This would be great if the suction cups would work properly. On each shade one suction cup does not hold suction to the window.
1,HORRIBLE! DON'T BUY! WASTE OF MONEY!,"I would actually give this product no stars. I purchased two of these Munchkin products at a local Meijers store. Right when I put them on our van's windows they fell off. I called Munchkin's customer service and asked for a refund since the suction cups do not suction onto our windows, they told me they do not do refunds. I wrote them and told them this is unacceptable. The customer service lady wrote me back and said they could do an exchange for a comparably priced sunshade. Today I recieved my new sunshades from the company, which happen to be the same shades that I purchased previously and that I had said the suction cups DON'T WORK! I put them on my car anyways, and within a few minutes they both are on the floor of my van because the suctions don't work. DO NOT BUY THESE!!"
1,JUNK!!!,"I had a terrible experience with these shades. They fell off on every car ride we would take and I would have to constantly re-stick them. And as another user said, they are dangerous!!! One wide turn and they fly off and can hit your baby. They are not light either, which is why I'm sure they don't stick to the window! I am currently looking for a cling shade instead to replace this junk."
1,Terrible product - not recommended,"I had high hopes for this product, but should have read the reviews first - everyone is totally right - the suction cups don't stick to the window - they fall off in just a few minutes - it really is a terrible product. I don't understand why or how this product made it to market - didn't they bother testing it first? Total waste of money."
1,Wish I had read reviews first!,The suction cups DO NOT work! I followed the instructions as printed on the package and the product still fell off. We received two sets at our baby shower and are unable to return them. You are better off taking the money you would spend and buy lottery tickets. You have a better chance at winning than getting the shades to stick.
1,These are terrible,"I tried to install these shades in our car, but the suction cups were deformed and they would not stick well. I finally got them to stick only to have them fall off several times. I finally got rid of them after one fell off and nearly hit my child. I would strongly recommend finding different shades. In my opinion, these are terrible."
1,Awful product,"Look for something else, this things are too small for my SUV so I installed them in my car, they'll come off very easily even without anyone touching them, they even can fall on your baby, stay away from this."
1,Money down the drain,"My husband and I bought this for our son and it didn't even last a day!!!! The suction cups keeps falling off no matter what we do and the shade doesn't help at all. We are totally disappointed. What a waste. We just got a set of shades from Costco, 2 for the side windows and one big one on the front. It was WAAAY better than these ones."
1,wouldnt stick,these shades wouldn't stick to our carwe tried all the windows and wiped them and tried fixing them when cool or warmresult: they simply wont stay up.they were absolutely useless and didnt work.
1,Munchkin Sun shades are horrible,These sunshades are extremely bad. They do not stick what ever you do. They are heavy and fall on children every time. I do not understand how are these kind of products are allowed to be in market especially when they are made for kids.Munchkin Two White Hot Safety Sunblock Shade-Black
1,I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing....,"I hate to sound like a broken record but these do not stick. Also they don't really block the sun either, I don't think any product like these would. I have tinted window and the sun always seems to find my baby's face."
1,Waste of Money,"Bought this at Walmart when my baby was born about two years ago. I am so glad for Amazon where people can share experiences b/c I was wondering if I was the only one whose purchase failed in any way to perform. It falls off constantly, doesn't cover much light anyway and YES, it is a hazard falling off like it does so near my child. Finally decided to throw it out and find another one here on Amazon."
1,total waste of money,"first of all, they fall off the windows constantly. secondly, the ""hot alert"" button turned red in the middle of sub zero temperatures in the winter when the sun was shining on it. thirdly, the sun shines through around it and my kid screamed anyway.they are now in the dump and i'm out 25 bucks."
1,Horrible Item,"Received these as a baby shower gift 3 months before our daughter was born. Put them in a box with other car items for the baby awaiting her birth. After shw was born we opened them up and 1 of the suction cups for each was misshapen and unusable straight out of the package. Tried using the 2 ""good"" suction cups to hang one and nothing. They won't stick no matter what you do (i.e. clean window, clean cup, use alcohol on window, etc.). Thought it was because it was winter and the cups where made out of plastic so got hard in the cold weather. Tried again now that the temp has gotten better but still no luck. Wouldn't recommend these to anyone."
1,These things suck...,"Seriously, these things were a waste of money. They don't stay on the window, and when they do, the sun stills shines on my baby's face... until they sling off the window and whack him in the head. Yikes.... please save your money and look for something else. These are crap."
1,Does not stick!!!,"These do not stick to any form of glass! No matter what vehicle window it goes in and what position (upside down, sideways, right way), forget about it sticking. If you have an infant/child carseat on the door sides and not in the middle, this product most likely will fall and injure your child. Complete waste of money!"
1,Piece of junk,This is terribly made. It does not stay stuck to the window...very dangerous as it could (and WILL) fall on your child. I contacted Munchkin and all they did was send me a new set... as if i wanted a new set?? Well..the only good thing is that i was able to return the new set to the store and get a refund. Please don't waste your money or put your child in danger. Choose something else!
1,Disappointment,"I was so disappointed that these do not stick on the window. If you somehow get it on, they fall off so easily! They don't work! The reason for my 1 star rating is that although I wanted to give it zero stars, I had to give it at least one or could not post my review."
1,Doesn't Stick to Glass,"Short of duct tape and super glue, I tried everything to get these to stick to the windows and they will. not. stick. Complete waste of money and time. Not to mention dangerous should these hit a newborn in the face or head. Avoid this product at all cost."
1,Suction cups don't stick!,The suction cups stopped sticking after a month. The plastic the cups are made from became hard and inflexible probably from the exposure to sunlight which is what the window shades entire purpose is. Total waste of money. We ended up getting the Britax cling shades and they work really well.
1,A Complete Waste of $. Only Lasts for a Few Weeks,"I initially loved these sun shades. They stuck to the windows of my SUV well, and I loved that they were retractable for times when my boys wanted to look out the windows. After a couple of weeks, we were taking a long trip in our truck, so I transferred them to our truck. They worked ok. They did come off a few times. When we got home, I decided to put them back in my SUV. They would not stick at all. The suction cups were no longer working at all. I tried everything to get them to work. I am SO disappointed in this purchase, and would not recommend these to anyone."
3,Nancy Drew Secrets Can Kill,"This was the 1st Nancy Drew game, and I have played all the games and I know that this is the least challenging of them all.The print-out walkthrough is only 6 pages long compared to 20+ on some. If you're new to Nancy Drew games I recommend getting this one first because it's so easy."
3,too short,"i liked it, but the graphics were too cartoonish and it was way too short, i could have finished it within one day. WAY too easy(...)"
3,"I liked it, but not good either.","This was okay, the new ending was goood but I would not play it more then 2 times. It get's boring really fast."
2,Not my favorite Nancy Drew Game,This was not my favorite. It was almost to easy and you kept having to change disks. That made it a pain to play.
3,it's fun but I did not like the graphics,"I bought this game for my two daughters (6 and 11), both are ND fans. I like the games too. but this one disappointed me with regard to the graphics. if you got used to play the newer games (Capu Cave, Phantom of Venice ) then you will know what I mean. Secrets can kill grpahics are cartoonlike, while the newer games have much more realistic grpahics. But all in all, my kids loved playing it, especially the mini games."
5,The best Christmas present my daughter received....,"After all the presents were unwrapped, this was the one that really interested by 12 year old daughter. We worked on it together, a few hours each day for about a week, until we solved the mystery. I think I enjoyed it as much as she did. It was so much fun to see her so involved, trying to logically figure out this mystery, using all hering reasoning skills. I've already ordered the other Nancy Drew software for her birthday. It's hard to find an item that you and your child both find enjoyable and challenging. It was fun to see her so ""into"" this game."
4,2 discs that had to be changed eoo often,This was a good game. I am an older gamer. I played at the most novice level and I still found it challenging. It really requires you to think and use your imagination. I did not like having to switch the cds so often. I played other games which had a lot more in them and were longer and only required one cd. And I thought the 2D graphics against the 3D backgroung made it look really cute and light. Some others may not like it but it appealed to me.
3,Too Quick!,"It was a good mystery, but it was too quick with the ending. The puzzles could have been a little harder.But this was the first game out of the sieries, so it was pretty good. If you are a beginner with mysteries than I would recomend this Nancy Drew game. If not than Ghost Dogs is more of a challenge and so is the Final Scene."
1,don't buy this one,i really love all the other nancy drew game but this one is really bad. theres two cds which you constantly have to change throughout the entire game as you go from place to place. The graphics are awful. I have a really good computer and it was still freezing it so i had to start over. all the sluething i did during the game didn't really matter by the time i caught.i would really recommend you choose some other nd game besides this one becuase this ones just a dud
3,Just Okay,"This was a good game, and fun, but definitely not as good as some of the later Nancy Drew games. The graphics were not as good, solving it was not as fun, and it goes by faster than the other ones. In this one the people are all drawn, but in the others they are 3D and look real. But it is still fun, especially if you have never played any of the other games and so have no expectations. If you love mysteries, I would recommend this series, but choose a later game. My favorite is Curse of Blackmoor Manor!"
3,SCK,Okay now I'm a big fan of Nancy Drew games and books. I have all of them and beat them all but one. But this game is nothing to brag home about. It was fun.Pros:Good plotNot that hardCons:It kept locking up on my PCThe caraters are cartoon like2 CDsIf you don't mind re-starting your PC and always bending over to put the CD in every 5 mins than I think you might like this game. If you do than you might want to buy someth8ing else with your [$].
2,Secrets can kill,this game is definently a waste of your time! i've played it and it is such a pain to keep changing the disks!! i had to changethe disks at least 100 times and i'm dead serious! the graphics are really bad too! the people are cartoon while the objects around them are not! I would only recomend this game to anyone who needs to kill time or waste it because i sure did!!!!!
2,Warning-Cartoonish Graphics-Don't compare with later games!,"If you have played the newer versions of Nancy Drew games, you will be very disappointed with the graphics. The people look like cartoons. The graphics are not rendered in 3D like the rest of the Nancy Drew games.The plot is good, but the graphics don't compare with the rest."
2,Nancy drew Secrets Can Kill,This game is not very good. There aren't enough places you can go and i hate how you have to change disks every time you have to go somewhere. Also the people are cartoons but the background is 3-D. I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.
2,Ok... not as good as the rest,there are a few reasons why this is not a very good game. Its annoying to have to switich between 2 discs when you go into some areas. Bad graphics - the people look like drawings! i have played almost every game and this one i would say is the worst. I think her interactive could have done better.
3,The Worst in the Series,"This is the worst game in the series.Bad graphics,the story comes straight out of the book.So if you have read the book Secrets Can Kill,there really is no need to play this.Also there are two cds,you have keep taking them out all through the game.Its really annoying.If you want to start with one,start with Stay Tuned for Danger.The rest of the series has little bits from each game.Like magazine covers ,satues etc.See if you can see them."
5,"challenging, but fun","Mom's review: I bought this for my 10 year old daugther, and she loves it. While she hasn't solved the case yet she has enjoyed hours of finding clues and moving through the case.Persistence, and thinking carefully pays off with this game. So do good notes. The graphics are great and Nancy's magnifying glass changes color when directed at a clue or direction in which she can moveKymmi's review: I really liked ""Secrets Can Kill"" It's really exiting when you hear the freaky music when you're alone in one room. The way you talk to someone when you're Nancy Drew is so cool they actually give you choices on what to say. I would rate this Cd rom an eight because it's a really good game but it's realy hard and adult. Because I'm only ten. But if I were 12 or 13 I would rate it a 10."
1,worst one ever!!!,i have played and beaten all the nancy drews and this was my LEST favorit ones.the graphics were cartoons and you dont even get to meet the bad guy.do not ever play this game!!!!!!
3,nancy drew screets can kill,i t was ok the only thing was changing the disc to one at time please the others ones i played was better then this one iplayed mihm great and tfs and dodi and gdoml they much better games thats the truth thanks
1,Lower than the LOWEST LOW!,"This game [is bad]. Period. I would rate it negative 500000 if I could. I mean, you can buy a LOAD of Nancy Drew games and love em all and trash this one. But the teachers lounge IS kind of cool.......... Wish you could e-mail me but I can't give you that vital info. Too bad if you are a challenger seeking a debate."
2,BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I really didn't like this game at ALL! The mystery about somone dead was good and all, and I know it's Herinteractive's first game, but come on! Cartoon characters?! Plus, it was easy and short, and not hard at all. If I were you, I would NOT buy this at all, NAH-AH! I hope this review helped! =)"
3,What??,"Well, I am 12 years old and I own all of the 13 Nancy Drew computer games.I didn't finish this game because I thought it was too confusing. I was scratching my head all the time.I mean I give the company that made this game some credit because you know it was the first game they made after all....I ssoo recomend all of the other games besides this one!"
3,Keeps you guessing,"I have tried to play this game and I guess i am not as bright as the kids now days. The codes have me baffled, the clues seem pointless, and i have decided I need a cheat sheet . And cannot find any clue books for sale or copy.This is a different kind of game, no blood,vulgar charectors,and a plot. Mystery clues, who done it. I just wish I had help to play it through and not get doors slammed in my face. I want this type of game,but with a clue book when i run into problems."
2,swapping disks is no fun,"It's an interesting story, and it's a challenge, but the constant swapping of the disks towards the end of the game really ruins the mood..."
5,good fun,My daughter is currently in the midst of this new game...she really loves it...as pretty much all the mysteries in the CD Rom series....there are lots of twists and turns that will occupy her for hours and hours!
2,Not this ND game,"If you're going to get an ND (Nancy Drew) game at all, don't get this one, at least not until you're done with all the other ones. Because this is the first one out of the entire Nancy Drew game series, it has terrible graphics. The people are 2D and look like they were cut out of a cartoon. It's even worse when the environment is 3D! Plus, you have to keep on switching between 2 disks! It's very tiring and annoying. If you have a fast computer, the likeliness of it is that it'll freeze a lot. That's what happened on my computer and it's fast, but when my friend played it (who has a slow computer), it only froze ONCE. But on the plus side, the whole concept of taking Nancy Drew books and turning them into interactive mystery games for children is brilliant. It's absolutely fun and educating but not to the point that it's boring. I don't suggest THIS specific mystery game, but I do suggest you start playing Nancy Drew games because all of them are fun except this one."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,"I BOUGHT SECRETS CAN KILL AND WAS VERY EXCITED!I LOADED IT ON TO MY COMPUTER,AND I WAS VERY DISAPOINTED!I HAD DIFFICULTY TRYING TO GET NANCY TO TALK!I HAD TO CLICK THE WORD I WANTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE I ACTUALLY GOT HER TO TALK!THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER PROBLEMS LIKE I COULDN'T GET TO THE SCHOOL,AND THE CHARACTERS TALKED VERY SLOW!EVERY OTHER NANCY DREW GAME IS GOOD!BUT DON'T WASTE YOUIR MONEY BUYING SECRETS CAN KILL!"
1,Awful!,"I absolutely DO NOT recommend this game. First of all, it was way too easy. I finished it in about 4 hours and since it is really no fun after you've played it once, I felt that the game was a total waste of money. Secondly, the game contains two discs and you have to keep switching back and forth between them which is positively annoying. Third, the graphics look way too cartoonish. I wouldn't really mind the cartoonish graphics if everything else about the game was cool, but it's not. I would not recommend paying money for this game unless you've played all the other games and are just desperate for another."
3,A conspiracy theory that at least makes sense,"I'm not big on conspiracy theories. Most of those surrounding the Kennedy assassination are pure bunk. This particular one is, at the least, well though-out and somewhat plausible. I don't buy it completely, but if you are interested, read it with an open mind. There may be at least a kernel of truth in it somewhere."
5,Learning,"This is a great video for children. I grew up watching this show and love it. Thank God my Mom woke us up early because this was an early morning show which we watched before school during the week. Charlie the Owl, Freddie the Frog and Henrietta the Hippo are very funny characters. I advise parents today to order this video because it teaches as well as make the kids laugh. Any more episodes?"
5,Fun,This is a guaranteed child entertainer. My nephew can become very busy easily so I thought this would be the great gift for him. He can learn and it will keep his brilliant little mind occupied.
4,Emmy Jo was hot...,"I remember this show. I was very, very young, and this show was my first introduction to sexuality in the form of Emmy Jo's smokin' HOT legs and body.She had a beautiful face and smile, great voice, and every episode I watched with great anticipation to see Emmy Jo in her super-small micro-mini bounce around in hopes of seeing her panties. Or, when she would be sitting with her legs crossed and maybe get an up-skirt shot. Yes, I was very precocious and extremely eager to learn how Emmy Jo's body ""worked."" Although being so young and not knowing what I would do with her if I had her. But, I definitely KNEW there WAS SOMETHING FUN to be done with her.If she was wearing pants in an episode, I put on the Super Friends, or whatever other show/cartoon was on before leaving to go to the babysitters. The only ""lessons"" I remember being interested in, was the fantasy lessons of Emmy Jo's body. Period. It's worth owning for the flashbacks! I highly recommend ALL seasons."
2,Too Dated,"The messages are excellent, but it's too slow for today's audience. The kids like the costumes, but it misses the mark in a number of areas. When the kids are old enough to understand the messages they get bored with the time it takes to make the point, and some of them while good lessons, are sad and ugly. Other shows like Berenstein Bears, or Franklin, or Care Bears to name a few, teach the same lessons but in a much more enlightened manner."
2,Great Guitar if it Wouldn't Keep Breaking,"I've gone through 6 of these guitars, and am in the process of returning 3 more to Red Octane for a replacement. These are great guitars when they are working, but they last only a few weeks before the green button stops working. There are so many different guitar models for Guitar Hero II & III for the Play Station, but guitars for the XBOX 360 are so limited they are impossible to find in a store."
4,why the Explorer,The only real thing i don't like about this game is the Explorer controller (like the shape but hate playing one) like A real one your strumming arm hurts if you play a lot its more of a mettle rock band guitar I wish they made the Flying V instead. Its still A fun game to play I just don't like that they choose a Explorer over the many other Gipson's
2,guitar hero 2 controller,"I'm very disappointed in this company that handled this product! They had sent the wrong guitar controller, and I had to sent it back. But it was at my cost of $12.30, in which they would only give me back $3.99 for the shipping! So I had to pay out of pocket $8.00 for the mistake they had made! Which I think they should have paid the whole thing being it was their mistake!!Now to top it off, I am now not even getting the controller. They had refunded me the money for it! I have a son that is very upset that he is not even getting his controller that he ordered!! So I paid 8 dollars for something that we didn't even get!! How great is that?? As you see I'm very disappointed and that concerns me from ever ordering anything from them again! They have not responed to my email about having this taking care of,besides letting me know that they would only pay the $3.99 for shipping!!"
2,"love the game, but TOTALLY snubs leftys!","ok the game is great, its additive, fun, and the addition of extra songs for the 360 version os very welcome.Thats where the plus's come inNow for the HUGE negative!NO DAMN LEFT HANDED GUITAR!Why, on a game that has a LEFT HANDED guitarist ON THE FRONT OF THE BOX! is there no ""limited edition"" or whatever, left handed guitar released?Ok Ok, I know all about the ""lefty flip"" but with the xplorer guitar the damn whammy is in the way of a lefty's strumming hand (left hand) it COMPLETELY ruins the experience.Before anyone says ""its good enough for hendrix, he played left handed with a right handed guitar"" yea yea I know all about that, ....but you shouldnt have to re train your brain to play a video gameyet more lefty prejudice and ignorance!"
1,This controller is NOT wireless!,"Red Octane, the developer of Guitar Hero, announced some time ago that Microsoft was preventing them from creating a wireless version of the Guitar Hero controller. The XBox 360 uses a proprietary wireless standard which makes it highly difficult for developers to create hardware that use it. Microsoft has also announced that they will not be allowing third-party developers to use the standard.Again, this controller for the 360's Guitar Hero is wired. And according to Microsoft and Red Octane, there can not ever be a chance for a wireless Guitar Hero controller."
5,Guitar Hero 2 Guitar Controller,Guitar arrived within 4 days. It works perfectly with the games Guitar Hero 2 and Rock Band 3. Fun to pay and a great change in pace from playing Halo. This can be enjoyed by a large age group.
4,"Grr, It Stopped Working...","After 3 years! I have gone through many guitar peripherals including the Les Paul GH3, Fender Strat for Rock Band, the original SG, an off-brand Firebird and the World Tour's guitar but I have to say I much prefer the GH2 Explorer. The controller was very durable and lasted me another 2 years even after my dog chewed up the cable. A small strip of tape later and the controller worked again. The FUN is a 5/5 but I am giving it a OVERALL 4/5 only because about 2 1/2 years into it, the rubber part that presses the actual board so that each button hits broke, luckily all I had to do is open up the guitar and replace the rubber parts with an off-brand guitar."
3,Decent controller for the price,"I got this controller because of the price and it did it's job. It's extremely lightweight and feels kind of flimsy. I wasn't crazy about the button layout on the neck of the guitar but that was mostly because of my style of holding it. The newer controllers are a lot more comfortable in my opinion, but for the price it will serve its purpose."
4,Guitar Hero 2 Controller for Xbox360,"This guitar is alot different from the guitar used for the WII. That means that it takes some doing to get used to it. after you're used to it though, I think it's a little better."
5,Addressing an issue...,"To the guy who posted below me: nowhere on this page does it say that the guitar is wireless. Your pointless ""review"" is doing nothing but wasting space on this page.Now, as far as the guitar itself is concerned, I personally love the feel and design. It's much more comfortable to use than the PS2 guitars, although it is a little bit heavier. Also, the controllers purchased separately from the bundle will NOT have defective whammy bars and/or tilt sensors in them. I've had two guitars from the bundle malfunction on me, but the one I bought separately works perfectly all the time.If you're lucky enough to find one, I'd say snatch it up, definitely!"
2,Hamfisted,"After using the Rock Band guitar, this one feels clunky. And the USB cord is too short.I returned it and I'm pre-ordering the wireless version for Guitar Hero III."
5,Flawless guitar,"This guitar is one of the best guitars I have played on and I own the wireless ""Les Paul"" guitar too,but I don't like it as much as this one.This guitar is awesome because the buttons are easy to press and easy to do guitar solos too.I use this guitar on Guitar Hero II,III,and Rock Band,it's nice and responsive even on hard mode.The guitar does come with a cord,but its nice sometimes when you don't have to recharge batteries all the time,I already have to do that with my other two controllers.I prefer GH guitars over RB guitars because the strum on the RB guitars has a mushy strum bar and it's hard to use.I had it for a year now and I don't have any problems with it.I recommend this guitar for GH/RB games and is easier to play songs on hard than the ""Les Paul"" and RB guitars.Pros: responsive strum bar and buttons,guitar is lightweight,easy to hold in hand,durable construtionCons: clicky strum bar and has a cord(not wireless)"
3,"Great game, poor quality control on guitar","Great game, great controllers - when they work. Ordered 2, one bad right out of the box. Tilt sensor erratic. RMA in work, but this just cost me another round of shipping. Manufacturer needs to tighten up the quality control program."
1,Quit working after one use.,Great game but guitar quit working after one use. The button started sticking and I had to return it. Charlie's house of discount was great and didn't give me any problems over the return. Guess I should have bought something that they still make...
4,Still the best all around package.,"NONE of the guitar controllers available for Guitar Hero/Rock Band games get it all right. All of them have drawbacks and you have to pick your poison, but the old GH2 controller gets my vote for the least amount of trouble overall. It's wired, it doesn't have solo buttons or anything fancy, it's a bit smaller than other controllers, the clicking is pretty loud, but it's durable, reliable, and easy to play. The only serious flaw besides not being wireless is that when playing online there will be a constant hum emanating from any headset plugged into this controller (even when the headset is muted!)"
1,Poor service,I did not receive an important piece as part of this package and I do not recommend this seller to anyone as he made no attempt to send me the piece that was missing even after I told him/her that it was missing.
3,Meh,"It's too overpriced for a wired guitar, I should have just waited for the wireless one for the 360... The guitar works fine, and wired does have it pluses, no batteries, computer capability... But the wireless one is far superior than this one... for the x-plorer, the buttons are tall, and you have to hear them click before you actually see the note being played, the whammy bar is delayed (the game doesn't show you whammy'ing until a good couple whammy's later), and the shape is not as comfortable as the wireless.. just spend a couple more bucks and get the wireless when it's released, or ebay it... but if you want a guitar now, you shouldn't be too dissappointed"
4,Durability,"I love this game and the only problem I have with the guitar is that it doesn't last as long as I would like it to. After about a month to two months the strum bar has started to mess up on all 3 of the controllers I have possessed. Every other aspect is still working perfectly it is just that the strum bar acts like I am still holding it down when I just strum it. It is not because I am to rough with it, I do not slam my hand down on the bar and it is not because I play it too much. I've gone for long periods without playing it so I think the internal wiring of the strum bar is a little weak or something to that effect."
3,favorite film,"unfortunately, I now know that there are different video formats throughout the world. I inadvertently ordered this film made for another region, so was unable to view it and have mailed it back."
3,For Art Lovers Only,"A whole lot of time is spent portraying and describing French art and antiques, so if you are not particularly interested in these kinds of things, this film will prove very draggy. Yes, there is a family drama worthy of interest and respect, but these dynmaics are overwhelmingly subordinated to the arcane details of art appraising and dealing--much to the detriment of the viewing experience. And if subtitles are a problem for you, that would be another reason to stay away."
3,It's okay if you like family talks.,"It's really nothing more than the family getting together to talk about what to do with the estate when the mother passed on. I give it 3 stars for decent performance and screenplay but otherwise, not recommending it to others."
3,Quite believable,"It realistically illustrates the variety of motives, interests, commitments that family member have when an parent dies and the estate must be settled. Most of the film concerns the interaction of the siblings and the disposal of the assets. Grief is a minor theme."
3,A look at estate liquidation,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the filmSummer Hours is about a recently deceased woman whose children decide on what to do with her massive estate. Due to estate taxes they sell much of her expensive art to museums and are also forced to sell her home. The film shows the grandchildren spending a final summer in the home with some of their friends.This film is very interesting and the art in the film is nice to look at.The supplements include an interview with the film's director Olivier Assayas, a documentary on the film's production and a documentary about the film's subject matter of fine art."
3,A Tale of Two Directors,"I agree with Robert Holzbach on this one, but I'll be a bit more charitable. Summer Hours is beautifully filmed and well acted, but the story is just not that compelling. Let's face it: a film about liquidating an estate is just not that interesting unless you're an estate liquidator.My favorite contemporary French director is Cedric Klapisch. His recent film Paris is also beautifully filmed and acted and he tells a compelling story of a dancer who needs a heart transplant. Both films feature Juliette Binoche, who is still excellent in her middle years.If you're a fan of the French new wave, comparing these two films is a bit like comparing Eric Rohmer's Six Moral Tales to Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless. Godard wins easily."
3,Good but incomplete,"I suppose if you collect modern comics this book is all you need. Sadly, it all but ignores the earliest comics published between 1900 and 1935. The token list in the Platinum section is better than nothing but just barely. These early comics deserve more space in the guide. My guess is that Mr. Overstreet owns none of these books so he has no incentive to list them."
3,The Art of Profiling : Reading People Right the First Time,"This is an excellent book for beginners who are interested in the art of profiling. It is good because it gives the reader the understanding of how to evaluate people and how to deal with them. That is very important when one is working in big organizations. This book will help you advance on the job. It will do that by giving you an intuition on how to deal with people. With that being said, this book includes exercises to improve one's intuition on the behavior of people. Moving away from all that, I gave it three stars because the book falls short in that it claims that the methods in the book are enough to classify just about any person. I think that the methods are pretty good. However human behavior is much too complex to allow us to classify people into just a few categories."
4,Quick test,This book basicly tells you to study a person and ask question about this person. This is another good starter book but not for someone that has any knowledge on the subject already. Its starts a weak profile on a person then stops.
3,to text bookie but still interesting,When I bought this book I knew Dan Korem worked for the F.B.I. so I thought this maybe would have a lot to do with his cases. It had very little but more on the process. It mainly depends to on what you're looking for in this book. If you want to know the process of profiling this is all you. If you're interested in the jobs that have been done find another one.
5,Relaxing at the cabin,"Very comfortable - low price but excellent quality. This chair had been intended for my family room but wound up at the lake cabin instead. The ability to recline and relax is wonderful and much more comfortable than a sofa or easy chair - with a folding tray to hold a book and a cool drink, it is perfect."
1,not comfortable at all,"The chair is very difficult to recline in, hard to push back. For the price of 149.00 you would be better off with a nice reclining patio chair. Granted, my expectations werent too high for the price. Additionally, it had to be assembled. Too pricey, uncomfortable, and the leather is rough and stiff. The seller did ship quickly though. Would not recommend."
2,In a word -cheap,"Its barely good enough for a computer chair. My main complaint is that its like the grunt of the group; its warped...it barely went together. Also the packaging was a joke...as if it were packed with the extra cardboard and foam laying around...unprofessional at best. The Chair sits one foot off the ground. Stiff cushions. The shiny good quality leather on the picture is misleading, its not quality leather...beware, you get what you pay for on this chair. I probably wont send it back because I don't want to deal with the hassle and cost."
1,disappointed,"i recently purchased this recliner for a special occasion for my husband. i am ""very"" disapointed in the quality doesn't look feel like leather, very uncomfortable and already my husband's elbow when through the arm of the chair. A cut was produced by his elbow, so the so called leather isn't really strong."
4,NICE COLLECTABLE !!,"This is a hardcover book. When you open it, instead of pages there are 2 card pockets.... one side has recipe cards. The other side has blank cards to add your own recipes to the ""book"". 4""x7"" cards are heavy stock... nice. Unique and interesting idea for a cookbook !!"
3,Several good points but use caution,"In this book, Jeremy Siegel continued his lifelong theme that stocks beat bonds in the long run. The dynamic thing he did in this book was change direction by showing that dividends matter. He surely succeeded in showing that dividends matter, and since this book was published a lot of companies have increased their dividends.Critics say Siegel is a market cheerleader although everybody credits him for conducting excellent and useful research. In this book, Siegel predicted that foreigners would continue to buy assets in the U.S. and they would buy American stocks into the distant future."
5,taxes on dividends matter little,"I am a bit amazed at the number of people who have given this book a bad review b/c Siegel supposedly doesn't address the fact that dividend disbursments are taxed -- he does!! He clearly states that they don't impact his portfolio returns much. If you do not believe him, run a simple simulation yourself where you compare a stock's return to that with dividends and without. The result? Not much of a change, actually. Taxes take about a 15-20% bite out of the FINAL value of the investment and their negative effect is simply ovwerwhelmed by getting so many shares on the cheap for so many years. This is the power of compounding in all its glory."
4,Behind the Scenes of government,"Quite an extraordinarily personal description of the passionate efforts during the six year period of 1914-19, when a handful of men banded together to forge the National Park system. This is the personal story of Horace Albright, the young assistant who was suddenly and unexpectedly thrust into the position of leader of the effort when the visionary and director, Stephen Mather, had a nervous breakdown. In deference to his admiration for his boss, Albright continued the work with an integrity and loyalty rarely seen in today's world. An excellent read for those who admire history in the making and the beauty of rugged nature."
2,Bigger than expected,For the price I am disappointed. It is heavy but a bit wobbley. The moving walking service is not tight and flimsy. the read out consol is very high. I can not see over it like the ones in the gymn
4,Good for elderly people,"This treadmill is reasonably priced, my wife and I put it together and I am 80, it has a good safety switch, starts slow and allows one to gradually increase the speed, can be easily stored and does not take up much space, has a display that can be read easily by the elderly and displays the most important things: speed, time, calories and distance. The only weakness I found is that the pulse indicator is not at all accurate but in 50 years of walking on tradmills I have never found one that was accurate. Customer service at both Amazon and Proform were very helpful in informing me when it would be delivered. The assembly instructions are clear and easy to follow but it takes two people to put it together. Threading the wiring to the display panel was a little tricky but worked exactly as it was described in the instructions. I am very pleased with it."
2,Not that good,"I wouldnt say ""Think twice before buying"".. Assembling was very confusing as the materials what they sent isn't any good, I had to use my common sense to assemble it. The treadmill isn't really sturdy. I am 220lbs and I am little scared running on it. Look for other products."
4,OH KL...YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN SIR...,"EXCELLENT. I LIKED THIS ALOT. THE MASSIVIVID STUFF WAS OK, BUT HONSTLY A LITTLE TO POP. I PICKED UP A COPY OF JIMMIE BROWN'S FEARFUL SYMMETRY AND THIS ALBUM REMINDS ME ALOT OF THAT (MUSICALLY)EXCEPT THE LYRICS ARE DEEPER. VERY GOOD STUFF. A LITTLE QUIET IN THE MIX, BUT I SURE WOULD SUGGEST THIS OVER ALOT OF THE CRAP COMING OUT NOWADAYS. HA! GOOD STUFF, THANX KL!"
3,A maze of seemingly useful clues,"""Brain-Compatible Classrooms"" is certainly a more catchy title than the earlier work ""Patterns for Thinking, Patterns for Transfer"" (1989) from which this book developed. The author has certainly done extensive reading in the field. Chapter 1 gives useful summaries of: the physiology and functioning of the brain, issues of nature vs. nurture, brain and mind, emotions, theories of the intellect, memory and learning. Chapter 2 defines the brain-compatible classrooms in terms of the Four-Corner Framework of teaching: for, of, with and about thinking. There are numerous charts, tabulations, graphic organizers, lists of skills and behaviors... Short of attending prolonged workshops, I'm afraid it is just impossible for most teachers to grasp the author's framework of mind and make sensible and good use of the material."
3,Good if you are an absolute beginner,"This book was required for a teaching course that I took, and I was just a little disappointed in it. Although the information is well organized and included practical ideas that could be used in an elementary-level classroom, I had been hoping for something far more in-depth.If you have no background at all in neurology or cognitive science, this would probably be a fine place to start. It would work well in a beginning level survey course. However, if your wish is to get a deeper perspective on brain based learning, I think I would stick to peer-reviewed journals."
1,Quit after writing one disc; expensive technical support,"I bought this to make a dozen CD's of a group bicycle tour vacation photo's - after burning the first CD the drive failed to recognize the presence of any additional CD's. I/O Magic charges $1.79/minute for technical support to your credit card - it cost me over $10 to be told to upload latest software (which they also charge for). Drive still defective and failed to recognize any CD's in tray, so had to return it. Expensive and time wasting lesson in extremely poor customer service. Exchanged for an Iomega that is working flawlessly."
2,"OK, But not worth your studying time","While I found the story in this book quite interesting, I do not think that it significantly improved my vocabulary. By using an ""SAT Word"" once in the book, I did not learn that word. The same words should have been repeated more than once, when possible. Perhaps, as another review suggested, the definitions should appear at the bottom of the page and not in the back - constantly flipping to the glossary was detrimental to my reading experience. I would not reccomend buying this book to learn vocabulary words, although I think the approach has some merit."
2,"Good story, bad format","I just finished reading the book Tooth and Nail. The reason I've chosen to review it is to warn you of the annoyance to come. Yeah, the mystery story line is an Ok touch, but having to continue going to the back of the book to look up the boldfaced words is so stupid and time-wasting. When I first started reading the book, I was learning a couple words because the bold ones didn't appear so often. When there were as many as 5 or more boldfaced words on one page, I got sick of flipping to the back of the book, trying to find the word in the glossary. This really messed up the purpose of the book: to better your vocabulary skills. I think that the publisher should have put the definitions of the words at the bottom of each page that it had the words on. This would have been much more efficent. All in all, I'd say if you can't study your SAT words any other way, this book should be one of the last choices you turn to."
1,interesting to struggling teen readers? puh-leeze!,"As a high school English teacher, I wanted to like this book. Sadly, as with many books that have an agenda, this one suffers from the story serving the message. My struggling readers do not relate at all to the main characters. They chose the book, and now they are begging to stop reading it-at chapter 8! Plus, there are paragraphs with 4 or 5 (or more) target words in them. That is way too many new words to be able to figure out what the words mean in context. (See others for the ""looking up"" problem.) Sorry, but I won't be offering it to other unsuspecting students on the pretext of its being an easy way to learn new vocabulary. I'd rather see someone be given permission to search more compelling pieces of literature that are or could be read in high school for SAT vocabulary and allow that researcher/writer to make up SAT workbooks that complement study of that novel."
1,maybe fun but not helpful,I don't see how this book is supposed to help prepare you for the SAT. It's a funny mystery with vocabulary words in it that may or may not be on the test. Wouldn't it just be easier to study from a normal SAT guide that explains the test? Those books also give you vocabulary words so you don't haver to hunt for them in some story.
5,Great book for kids to study for the SAT,"I always recommend this to High School kids to read and prepare for the SAT and ACT, and college prep.."
1,Horrible,I had to read this book for English Honors 1 but i could not even get past the first 10 chapters. They should have at least included a better plot. They should of also tried to make it less obvious that the book was just stuffed with the most longest words and in the most unhelpful way. The only thing useful about this book is the glossary at the end and all the practice problems other than that horrible. It would of helped if the book had a better plot or story line making it easier to remember the words.
1,Can we stop yet?,"This book is horrible. As being forced to read it for a class, I can't say enough that I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. No matter how many fun voices you put into this book, it gets boring. There are so many other things you can do. Heck cleaning your house is more fun. This book just drones on and on. There is no mystery that we've been able to find yet and we are on Chapter 15. In the first chapter though you can make some sex jokes. Truthfully, this book has turned into a joke. Don't read it if you can avoid it."
3,A somewhat bleak view,"I found this book to be helpful, yet I really do believe that it sounded a bit pessimistic at times. If this was the only book I read about Georgia, I may not want to go there...however, maybe the reality is a little grim."
1,not a very good book!,I thought this book was very out of date! I would not recomend this book to people that want to travel to Georgia.
2,Adorable but too expensive for poor quality,"This is an adorable costume. I didn't mind spending more money than intended because of the originality of the costume. When I received it though I was disappointed in the quality. The eyes on the cap are barely sewn on, the eyelashes are just dabbed w/ glue, & there were 2 decorative green pipe cleaners that are falling off at the base of the eyes. The first washing took care of those. The velcro chip strap was rough & scratched baby's chin, I had to snip the ends. The shell feels like it will unravel w/ any handling.I am pleased w/ the sizing, my son is very tall for his age, & there is still plenty of wiggle room."
4,Adorable but cheapy. Still worth it for us.,"Our son wore this when he was 13 months old and not walking yet. He literally won the neighborhood costume contest with it. People wouldn't stop talking about the snail baby. It was adorable.That said, it is very cheaply made, the material is not really soft and parts of it that were just glued on are falling off. It is definitely a one-season costume. It is possibly too expensive for the quality, but it is definitely adorable. We splurged and don't regret it."
2,not worth the money,"i am not a picky person however when i buy something i dont want it to fall apart before it is even worn. when this costume arrived i was disappointed on how thin the body suit fabric is, in the pic it looks warm and comfy in all actuality it is very close to being see threw and scratchy, most of the costume is glued together so the snail shell started falling off just by it hanging on a coat hanger, I wish i would have bought a blue jump suit and made it myself, and the sizing is off my son is 9 months and will hardly fit in it, he is avg. sz. oh yeah the shell part will all come unrolled if you slightly push on the middle its not stitched or even glued (which i can see that glue is there first choice of assembly) it is going to be fun to doctor this costume up, i gave it 2 stares only due to its originality."
4,Cutest snail ever!,"I purchased this last Halloween for my (at the time) 15 month old son. Everyone commented on how adorable he looked. It was a very unique costume with the ""back pack"" snail shell as the winning element. I received lots of compliments & inquiries as to where I purchased the costume. I also purchased a stuffed animal baby ""snail"" for my son to carry around and that was cute too. My son only wore this to go trick or treating...was the material top knotch?? Sadly, no but for the short time he wore it it was fine. Besides...he wore his own cotton t-shirt & leggings pants underneath so how uncomfortable could this costume be? Overall, I give it 4 stars...it made an impression & my son loved wearing it!"
2,Interesting for history perspective,"Errol Flynn loved Cuba and thought, like many that Fidel Castro was the country's savior. Well, everyone is wrong now and then. The film is about freedom fighters Flynn is backing as a ""journalist"" in Cuba. As a film it is really lame, but has some value as a documentary. worth a look for it's curiosity value."
5,Unbelievably good.,"It's hard to believe they're sugar free. I've tried lots of sugar free desserts, and these are the best. No weird after-taste. I'm the only diabetic in my family, but I can bring these to family gatherings and everyone enjoys them."
4,Good introductory set for little hands,"We bought this for my son, who was 3 at the time. He really enjoys playing with his ""blocks"" and superheroes. This set was a decent value, in that it includes 3 superheroes....the others in this series come with two. He ejnoys playing with this set so much, that he has asked for more blocks so he can build bigger towers and castles! We just purchased a 250 piece tub (with plenty of additional space inside for ""extras""). I've looked at some of the other coordinating sets (the one with the hulk figure, etc.) and some of the pieces seem to be the same from set to set (e.g a tree, a slide, etc.) If you're looking for one set to get them started, I would recommend this one. It has enough to play with for a toddler, without taking over their whole room!"
5,"Excellent ""first timers"" book",THis was a wonderful book. It was my first book from Amazon.com as well as a book for my very first horse purchase. I was curious about small acreage layouts and how to get the best use of your limited space. This book provided everything I could have asked for besides the actual blueprints of the barn. This is a must-see book!
2,Not enough depth,"This book seems okay as a cursory glance, but every time you have a specific question, the answer they give is too superficial. If you really intend to keep a horse, what good are overviews?"
2,SMALL ACREAGE???,"The smallest ""acreage"" in this book was 3.5 acres!!!Try living in CALIFORNIA where most people have only 1 acre or even 1/2 acre for their horse. THAT is what I was looking for...how to manage TRULY SMALL amounts of land with a horse.GEEZ, 3 acres sounds like a RANCH.And the barn layouts. These barns look like the Taj Mahal!No way I have that much room.However, it did have interesting info I can use...like info on daily feed planning (that's in my horse care book). The rest...hmmm. not so useful.Maybe I need to look for HORSEKEEPING in a residential area?"
2,no info on one horse facilities,"stupid that it starts of with 10 acres, should start with a backyard arangement and more in depth information ..."
2,A Little Too Basic,This book would be more for pretty inexperienced horse people just starting out. I was hoping to find more on arenas and footing and things like that since I already have a barn and horse property and have had horses all my life but never built my own arena. It was too basic for me.
3,"Less Lecture, More Substance","To the extent the book focuses on factual information about horses, facilities, design, and management, it's a good book. Unfortunately the author too often digresses to lecture readers about how they should run their operations according to her own unique set of value judgments."
5,"Valuable, Practical, and Very Informative","This is a great book for anyone planning to keep horses at their own facility. A must-have. It's full of useful information on everything you need to know. It's also easy to read, and very interesting."
5,Loved in CD-ROM format!,I just purchased the Master Library CD-ROM and love the flexibiltiy of this format!
4,A Good Vintage Mystery,Blood on the Vine is just the kind of book you want to read on a rainy afternoon. Donald Bain presents a cozy puzzle with all the right sort of villains to keep the reader entertained. The setting in California wine country was a wonderful vacation from the Maine winters. So vivid the descriptions I could almost taste the wine. Including Jessica's friend the Scotland inspector brought a light touch of romance to the plot. I think this is one of the best in an enjoyable series. I recommend it it to all of Jessica Fletcher's fans
5,Mystery puzzles,Beat her at solving them is my goal. I get fooled at times. It is well worth the investment you make.
5,No Whining from me!,"Living in (South American) Wine Country and having visited Napa Valley, I felt at home with Jessica in this book. I would have liked more wine-making knowledge weaved into the story, but it did have the basics. The plot had me guessing to the final pages as to the identity of the guilty party. But overall, I felt terribly sorry for Jessica's (boy)friend, George Sutherland, of the Scotland Yard. He truly had the worst possible of vacations on which everything went wrong for him and yet he never complained. His dedication to Jessica should be acknowledged someday soon, poor guy."
1,Do not buy for PFM,"This is an album by an Italian pop singer. He sings in a sixties pop style similar to someone like Tom Jones, except he is less melodic. I can't understand Italian, so I don't know if his songs have any deep meanings.I bought this album because the great Italian progressive band, PFM was playing accompaniment. This concert comes to 2 years after the PFM album, Jet Leg, and Mauro Pagani is no longer with the group. PFM is down to 4 musicians, who are all still in the group today.PFM just plays in the background music, written by De Andre. They are just accompaniment. They never break out. It could be anybody playing the background music.This is volume 1 of a two volume set. I must admit that I have only heard volume 2. My review is based on volume 2, but I doubt volume 1 is any different."
1,good idea but doesn't work,I have had some success with similar products but THIS ONE DID NOT WORK FROM THE START. The Westek unit works for a few months and then dies. This Thomas & Betts unit required about 10 taps of the lamp to run its cycle. I Disconnected it immediately.
3,Lamp Control,"I had 2 of these for a number of years, which were purchased from Menards. The lamp connected to one of these is used constantly. Seems the bulb/unit/whatever blew out and unit would not work any longer. Replaced with the above purchase. This NEW unit is very tempermental. It did NOT like the first lamp I tried it on - wasn't reacting - which is still working nicely with the old one from Menards. Moved it to the 'constantly' used brass lamp and managed to get it to function. 'Sensitivity' switch had to be on HI. Also by dampening my finger/s, it would react better. I'm not sure what the manufacturer changed, but something is different from 8 years ago!"
1,Did anyone had it working?!?,"Tried on 3 different lamps with metallic bases, in 3 different rooms : at best, when it turned on, all I got was a dimmed lamp but with no possibility of controlling the intensity. The instructions sheet doesn't even talk about the sensitivity switch on the unit?"
1,"DOA, but supplier first-rate","Item arrived in timely manner, but did not work. Contacted the supplier (BIC Superstores), and they promptly sent a replacement--did not require me to return the defective item. Unfortunately, the replacement didn't work either. However, I DO NOT FAULT BIC for this; most likely they got a bad batch from their wholesaler. (I am familiar with this item as I've had one for a number of years, and my old one finally gave up the ghost.) Anyway, item was a dud; but, I feel that BIC is a stand-up supplier."
5,Hustled by Larry Flynt,"I find this book to be interesting.I also find the negative reviews to be telling. Why,again, is the woman to blame?Those may call her a liar, but what about her father? Interviews made with him detail his life growing up in Kentucky of how his first sexual experiences were with a young cousin and a chicken, being raped by a man, his promiscuous mother and drunk father. How about his support for his child-molesting friend who created Chester the Molester? When it comes to what she said,he said stuff, I would wager this one on the daughter."
1,She is a bad liar.,"There are really good liars who can sell us anything, and there are others who should simply not even try because they are so bad at it. This twisted author is one of the worst."
1,Vengeful rantings of a old man....,"This book is nothing more than vengeful rantings of an old man. It is sad that this man feels that he has to air his family's dirty laundry. I feel sorry for him. Bottomline, Don't waste your money on this crap."
1,You Need A Word From The Lord (Vicki Winans),Let he that is without sin cast the first stone.If someone hurts you call on God. If someone hates you call on God. He is the answer to pray. He heals all wounds and he to can heal you. It's not too late to surrender yourself to God.
1,Re-recorded Version--NOT ORIGINALS,"If you want the original versions of these tunes, look elsewhere. They are not here."
5,a good christmas story with values,"a good story reminding young ones that Christmas isn't all about getting presents. It does not have a religious overtone, so if you're looking for something more spiritual, keep looking."
1,Nice Book.... If You're a Pantheist....,"Interesting how a book that professes to be about the real reason for CHRISTmas never brings Him into this story. I particularly disliked the line in the ending carol that stated how they would ""pay homage to the stars above""... on Christmas? To celestian bodies? Interesting.Christ is how Chistmas is saved. A mirroring of the gospel message fits nicely here without a stretch... not some panteistic parable about how good finally wins over bad... and then in our ""oneness"" with this inner good we're compeled to pay homage to stars and such. This book was jettisoned from our collection as have all secular centric Christmas tales.It may seem like an over-reaction however our children are assaulted with the secular [read:worldly] things... no... they are pummeled with them. Christmas is about Him. Don't dilute it.In His Name..."
3,"Mediocre Guide, but there really isn't anything else","There aren't too many guides out there specific to Central Europe. The book was helpful for general reference but, lacked any good detail for traveling. The maps were somewhat helpful, but always seemed to be just limited enough so it didn't show where you wanted to go. The book is great for the tourist that doesn't want to get away from touristy places. If you want to go local this book is not helpful. And what is it about travel books? When are they going to make a travel book that you can seperate out the sections you want? If you don't want to carry around some 10 lb brick of a book and only the sections you need. I know the technology is out there."
3,Unstatisfied,"My boyfriendand I travel a lot, and we usually take a lonely planet along with us.The Central europe one, we've only used it for the Check Republic. It was alright but we think that the tips you usually get in this guide seemed to be missing. For the basics is fine, but we weren't totally satisfied with it. We understand that is not only about one country, that includes other's as well and the information is shortened, but anyway,it was of help only to a point.We hope this information is of help for you,kind regardsLucila Lauda and Ulrik Bechtold"
4,A story with humour,"Completed by Curtis Peebles after the death of Milt Thompson the story of Flying without Wings is told by a pilots pilot. Milt has the uncanny ability to mix the technical engineering side of experimental aviation and then put the reader in the pilots seat for a hair-raising ride from 40,000ft down to the ground."
5,"Subtitle says it all: Before the Space Shuttle, Testing NASA's Wingless Aircraft","Firsthand recollections told with famous NASA humor. Loved reading it, esp. since Milt Thompson mentored my dad. When you live history as a kid, you are oblivious to it. As an adult, I can read back through and appreciate what risks they took and fun they had doing it. Real ""hands-on"" engineering research accomplished with chalk marks on the floor, a souped-up Pontiac, pink flight boots and all!"
4,stilettos aren't everything,"I didn't like it as much as the first one ""Enchanted Inc"". It was still entertaining, but the focus was on getting the man and the intimacy that goes along with it and how you can only do that if you look good."
5,thoroughly enjoyable,"A great fun read! If you like fun fantasy that isn't stupid, this is the series for you. Hope the series continues through number 4."
4,"Smart, Witty & Inventive!","Enchanted, Inc. and Once Upon Stilettos weave an intricate and inventive story of magic, heroes and the battle of good versus evil. I love Shanna Swendson's take on Merlin and Arthur. This is a must read for anyone who wants to believe in magic and the power the most ordinary person. I have recommended this series to everyone I can think of!Also, check out Shanna Swendson's website, her daily blog is always entertaining. According to the website, there will be five books in this series. I cannot wait for Damsel Under Stress coming May 1, 2007. Read the first two now so you can be ready for ""Damsel""!"
5,great read,"Like I said about Enchanted Inc., I loved this book. Once again, an easy, charming read. It is clean, but well written, so there is still excitement and romance. Great job, Shanna!"
4,Very sweet song,"The combination of DJ Bobo and Sandra's vocals works very well together. The song itself is simple and lovely and it reminds me of the type of melodies you heard back during the days of Abba and Blondie. The song has a very sing song catchy hook. It makes me happy. However, the Gens Gad's club mix is horrible. If it was not for the regular version and that I am a Sandra's fan since the beginning of time; based on the remix, I would have given it only 3 stars. The best version of this song is not available on this disc, it is the DJ Rabinu mix for XTC radio. This version is a combination of the regular vocal mix with the instrumental version on this album. It works extremely well and I give it 5 stars. Start your search engine and find this version, it is worth it."
5,Great Resource Material,"I appreciated the layman's terminology and the black and white sketches in this guide. As a Pennsylvania native, I found this field guide to be ""right on."" Easy to understand. Gives the highlights for the flora and fauna of the region. Great resource for the armchair naturalist, too."
3,Granny's HO scale house,"Lots of nice details and at least you don't have to glue the pieces together. However, rather expensive for what youcan get. Adding an interior light helps for night viewing around the train track."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"The X1300 has been a reliable low-end standby for entry-level gaming systems for several years. There's no reason to avoid this card because of Vista issues (or other Windows issues). ATI Radeon cards have fewer issues than nVIDIA cards, overall, with drivers and compatibility, and the X300/1300 line has been and continues to be well-supported even with finicky, demanding games like Sims 2. I have read about many issues with nVIDIA cards with Sims 2, even when used with nVIDIA motherboards (for example).Do your research before you buy any video card, but if you're planning to play a game with your card, research that game's forums - fansites or official - to get the real scoop on drivers and compatibility. Don't rely on an Amazon review that has nothing to do with the card or software and everything to do with Microsoft's less than stellar implementation of the Vista OS."
4,Good card for the price,"I purchased the card from ebay for around $30. It does everything I ask it to do. It outperforms the nVidia chip built into my HP. Any problem with vista seems to have been ironed out. I have had no issues with it, using ATI's latest drivers."
3,Not all it's cracked up to be!,"If I had it to do over again I wouldn't have made this purchase... mainly because there is nothing on this swing to entertain a child other than the LOUD whir of the motor! Yes, the adjustable height is great but not worth the exchange of having something to engage and entertain the child... Maybe the other model with an attachable toy section would have been a better investment! My daughter does love this swing however and takes her morning and afternoon naps in it, in the reclined position!"
3,show & quality,This is a great show. However the dvd had a problem. The 1st one we received had a constant low humming/buzzing background noise. We exchanged it for a 2nd copy. THAT one had the same problem! We requested and received a refund. A bad manufacturing run perhaps?
