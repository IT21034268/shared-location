5,This. Was. AMAZING!,"One day in the wonderful life of me, I got my paycheck! And I decided to buy the complete series of Code Lyoko because I really wanted it all of a sudden. I was told I'd get it in about a week and a half to two weeks. I actually got it, FOUR DAYS LATER! I was slightly hesitant when I bought this because it didn't say anything about the language. I was worried that it might be in French. I do not know French.../= But it is in English!The only downside is that it doesn't fit my widescreen tv. It's basically a fullscreen(square) with big black boxes on the right and left of it, but I really don't care about that. I was just so happy to have it. I guess it also didn't matter to me because I don't have a plasma tv. If you have a plasma and want to buy this, I would suggest watching it on a laptop or a tv that isn't a plasma so the square won't burn into the tv.I plan on keeping this for a very long time and it's worth the money. To me anyways!Code Lyoko, Stronger After All!"
5,Happy,"Arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Not a bad price for the box set either. Glad to finally have this set in my collection, it was one of my favorite tv series as a kid."
2,Tiny!,"Ditto to comments about the small size of this watch, despite it being called ""midsize"". Very hard to read!"
4,good as usual,"Ecko and Chuck Roberson come up with another quality album. It's got the upbeat dancers (""Booty Scoot"", ""Whoop That Thang""), blues (""You Ain't Cheatin' by the Rules"") and slow R&B (""Play on It"", ""Save it For Me""), though the best two songs are two up-tempo Southern soul tracks ""Back Up Lover"" and ""Mr. Lover Man"", both showing Roberson's strong Tyrone Davis influence."
3,m,Works ok not what i thought heats up quick but doesnt get wrickles out like i thought it would especially on my dress shirts.
4,Good value,"Good value compared to others on the market. Not a five star only because it is not as stable as heavier, metal based (more expensive) competitors. Works great."
4,Liked this,This steamer works very well- my daughter needed it for her college dorm and now everyone uses it!!! I would recommend!
2,good for a little while,"This thing worked great for a while. It steamed well, but it was very lightweight, easy to tip. My wife never liked it for that reason. After a little over a year, (and we do not use it much) the hose broke at the connection (plastic fitting). I actually repaired the hose but it was downhill after that. It would stop steaming , got very erratic. It's going in the trash."
5,steamer,works great! Shipment was fast and arrived in less than 2 days. Easy to assemble and woks like a champ.
4,"it does the work, but design could be better.","PROit does what it should do.CONCannot hang heavy stuff on the steamer, otherwise it may flip over.it is not easy to keep it in the storage room because of the pipe.the head brush cannot attach firmly. Always fall off during steaming.Additional Note:My water tank cup is lost during a recent house move. I contacted the manufacture and they send me a replacement part for free. Great service!"
1,first few weeks good only!,My mom bought this product for original price. And for the first week it worked fine but after a while it stops working and the hot water starts to drip from it and it burns. After awhile the steamer doesn't even get rid of wrinkles if.
2,Mine worked until it crapped out,"I have my steamer for little less than a year now. I don't use this that frequently however when I do, I go through quite a bit of shirts at a time. This unit worked well at first, but for some reason it began to stop producing steam after the initial 5 minutes of usage. Anyone else here have that problem?"
4,"After Almost 3 years, it caught fire!","I LOVE this steamer, here's my guarantee that the darn thing kicks butt, but here's the small fault. it started a small smokey fire this afternoon inside it's white shell in the circuit boards...luckily i had spray water available (was ironing a shirt) and was able to put it out quickly. I'd give this steamer 5 stars, but it tried to end my life today after ~3 years of loyalty...amazon made true with their EXCELLENT customer service as usual, and are sending me a new one...AFTER 3 years! now that is customer service."
3,didn't last long,"This steamer worked awesome, but broke after a year and a half of using it. We used it five days a week. The hose ended up breaking out of water reservoir."
3,A little clunky but gets the job done,"For the price, it does what I need. If you need it for more than only occasional use, I would recommend spending more."
1,Didn't even last a year!,It worked decently for the price of the product but I had it for 7 months when it just stopped working. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
4,Is it really Professional?????,"All-in-all I would say yes! I mean it's not like the average dry cleaners steamers, but it'll due for what I need it for. As a wedding consultant/coordinator I found that many members of bridal parties needed the use of an iron/steamer, so I decided to invest in one. It has been a hit as far as making the final touches to the attire spectacular for such a special day! All-in-all, great investment!"
3,not as good as expected,"Although it can smooth some wrinkles (not effortlessly as said in product description, due to the lack of continuous steam). It's not a substitute for an iron."
3,Design could be improved.,Creates steam in less than a minute. Water resorvoir is awkward and hard to drain for storage. Tube from base unit to wand is stiff and hard to store when cool. Steamer works well and is worth the price.
3,Easy to use,"Seems to work best on sweaters. Not for linens.I have to wear gloves to prevent burns on my hands.I dropped the handle, and now it leaks. Made of plastic.The shipping was very fast!"
4,Best clothes steamer for the best price,"Works very well, makes steam quickly, and is ready to use within a minute after turning it on. A shirt or pants takes about 3 minutes each to steam, i usually do all my clothes for the week at once in about a half hour. But we also keep the steamer in the closet and use it for last minute touch up before we go out. I started just using tap water instead of filtered, and have not had any problems. I do drain it after every use though, just in case. There is a handy drain plug at the bottom of the unit. Of course you must use caution with this thing though, it makes hot steam, and the hose is very hot, as it would be with any steamer.Cons: It could be more stable when hanging clothes from the hanger, the unit tends to wobble. The stand is a bit flemsy also, i broke mine by tilting it and had to add a metal bar. So treat it gingerly when moving it."
3,Not tall enough,"The steamer heats up quickly and does a fine job, but the pole that holds the garment is too short and you have to bend down, I wish they offered an extender to make it taller."
1,Lasted 11 Months,"Purchased this steamer on 12/30, it's been totally unusable since November 2011. Used exactly to specifications, cleaned regularly. Completely disappointed, with no recourse (no warranty past 90 days? They must know their product won't last)."
2,Deception,"This thing steams but does not work really well, I was expecting steam to be shooting out from the hose, instead it barely came out! Might as well leave your shirts hanging in the bathroom while you take a hot shower."
2,Poor quality steamer,No continuous steam. Did a poor job in removing wrinkles from a polyester curtain and a horrible job on cotton drapes. Ironing would have been quicker!!
1,"Its OK, but wait to buy it when it goes down in price","I WAS REALLY MAD WHEN THEY DROPPED THE PRICE $12 BEFORE IT SHIPPED, AND EVEN MORE BEFORE I RECIEVED IT. WAIT UNTIL ITS UNDER $50 TO BUY, IT'S ALL ITS WORTH!!This is kind of cheap and standard for clothes steamers like this, I know this because I bought this one to replace a similar one of another brand that I had for about the last two years that was self-destructing."
2,Lawrence Czajkowski,"I ordered this for my wife after reading several of the reviews. I thought it would ideally fit her needsUnfortunately, the item was returned as it did Not peform to her expectations. It didn't get some wrinkles out of her blouses.It was a disappointment"
4,1st time steamer user,It works will. I have never used a steamer so it takes time to get use to using it.
3,Cheap but works,"This steamer works OK, you do need to constantly clear the hose of the condensation water that accumulates or the steam stops. It is also prone to tipping if you hang a garment on the top while steaming."
4,Love it!,"I received this as a gift in April. I love it! It is so much faster and easier than dragging an iron out for shirts, tops, etc. Just be careful not to get your fingers too close to the steam. I still break out the iron for my cotton pants so I can get a nice crease. It works great on graduation gowns!"
4,Fabric steamer,"I got this for my wife. She uses it almost daily with major problems. For some reason, the steam sometimes stops flowing, but than comes back on all of a sudden. User error? Other than that, no major complaints and we are satisfied with the product."
4,It does the job,"I recently purchased this steamer, and it works great. The steam is quick and HOT. I accidentally burned my thumb twice, but my fault. Handle does get a little warm to touch.It could use a longer hose, but is adequate.I had recently purchased curtains for my home, and was able to do every room with ease. Medium tank. Needed to be refilled a few times.Otherwise, did a fabulous job."
4,Great Product and Price,I bought this steamer when my iron broke and I needed to replace it so I decided to get a steamer and an iron. I love this steamer. It saves me so much time and my clothes come out so crisp. I use it a lot and I would defenitely recommend it to my friends.
4,Can't beat the price!,"Prior to this purchase I had 3 similar steamers made by Sharp, but unfortunately each one ended up with a faulty switch. The Steamfast switch looks to be more durable. Heats quickly and works well! (Only comment would be that cord could be longer)...but for the price you can't beat it!"
1,Broke after 8 months,I purchased this steamer to stream my best friends wedding dress and to use on occasional clothes of my own. It worked fine for the first few months but then I noticed it was leaking. A few months after that (approximately 8) the tube that connects the head to the base broke where it plugs into the base. I tried duct tape but it didn't work.Although it was 8 months I didn't use it all that often. It was not a good purchase.
2,Failed Fast,"I was only able to use my new SteamFast SF-407 steamer about 5-10 times to remove wrinkles from photography studio muslin backdrops before it failed. My longest duration of continuous use was about 15 minutes. After each use I promptly turned it off and unplugged it. I was pleased with initial results. It did a great job warming water quickly and removing stubborn wrinkles with ease. However, with no warning it now fails to warm water and produce steam. I used it successfully less than two weeks ago but now when I turn it on the red power light illuminates but nothing else happens. I've followed each of the troubleshooting instructions in the product guide with no success. I must now contact Customer Service for warranty service."
2,Nice Product BUT Low Quality,"I purchased this fabric steamer a year ago and it worked great; however, it just stopped working today, no more steam coming out. With this price, I would expect this product would have lasted much longer. Very diappointed!"
5,Best Steamer,Just love this steamer - so much better than the one I had previously. Steams starts in just seconds and does a wonderful job.Can't beat this steamer for the money. Does a better job than the professional steamer we have a work.
3,I don't think any steamer will ever live up to my expectations,This is a well build product. It puts out a bunch of steam too. I just dont think any steamer could ever be as effective as an iron. I guess buy it if you have really delicate stuff that you need to steam.
5,Clothes Steamer,"I really like this clothes steamer. It does a great job. It is quick, and you don't have to fill the water reservoir all the time like with an iron. The only downside I see is that you can't really press items. It will get the wrinkles out no problem, but you will not get a good crease. This is fine by me as long as it makes my life easier."
4,Cleans well but gets kind of hot,"It is very effective cleaing but I am nervous about how hot it gets. The Wand gets a little too hot. Also its hard to find the product details, but there is no crease attachment. Instead they give you a piece of foam with an insulated cover. The length of the tube is also a little short. Since there is no brake on the wheels, it rolls into you if you are pressing something taller. I wish I'd spent more money and gotten a better model. researched after my previous steamer a Rowenta lasted less than a year. One thing the Rowenta had though, was an insulated tube. The steam tube on this one is a thick plastic/rubber like material, but it still gets hot. I almost burned my legs several times while using it wearing shorts. It makes me nervous around my daughter."
4,Economical steamer,"This garment steamer delivers a strong force of steam, so it does its job very well. I like the fact that with a quick pass of the wand I can remove wrinkles in a minute. The only thing that I don't like is that it has wheels and moves while I pass the wand. Otherwise, it's a good machine for such a small investment."
4,not bad...,"I hate ironing and this is nice to get the wrinkles out quickly without lugging out the board and iron. I'm not sure it works quite as well as an iron, but I still like it. It heats up very quickly and is easy to store out of the way. It gets the wrinkles out of lightweight fabrics great, heavier stuff takes a bit longer."
1,Hose broke after 5 months,"The hose broke. I thought it had just come lose, but the hose had broken. It worked will until then. Just a heads up."
3,broken within a year,"Loved this steamer until...it broke within a year of purchase. I'll replace it, but darn!!! Can't find replacement parts either. I think the hose is too curvy. The nozzle that holds it to the base gets too much stress."
3,Awesome until it stopped working,It wasn't love at 1st slight (ugly design) but it was love at 1st try. It was just the right amount of steam for my work blouses. I still had to use an iron for thicker material but the steamer worked very well on everything else. I had it for about a year ( 10 months) when it suddenly stopped steaming. The hose would get very hot but for some strange reason the steam just wouldn't come out. i guess ill have to buy another but i'll definitely try another brand this time hopefully that wont suddenly stop working.
4,Works well enough. Good for things you don't want a crease in.,"There is a fair amount of a learning curve to get used to it. I don't use it on anything I want a crease in because it is too difficult for me to do. I bought an ""Oveglove"" to see if it would be easier for me to use it to try to get creases and it wasn't. Heats up fast, goes thru a fair amount of water and the hose gets hot to touch so be careful when using it."
3,Careful,Somewhat clumsy. Be careful - it's easy to burn yourself. Storage might be a problem. To fill water - could have been made easier.
4,Good for the price,"The first time I got this steamer, the little plastic ring that screws the hose onto the base crumbled into pieces when I tried to attach it. Amazon was awesome about sending me another one right away and arranging for me to send the broken one back hassle-free. But beware when you are putting it together to not tighten that ring too much.I've had the steamer itself for over a year now, and I have not used an iron since. It works really well and does what it's supposed to. Just be careful not to catch your finger or hand in the steam...ouch! If something is really really wrinkly and a thicker fabric, it is not too effective since you'd have to hold the steamer over the wrinkle forever, but for suits, pants, skirts, dresses, jeans, and shirts that have normal post-washing or wearing wrinkles it works great.Definitely not a top of the line steamer, it's still a bit flimsy, but for the price, it's a pretty good one that has been very useful to me for over a year now."
4,"Great steamer, good customer support","I purchased this steamer about 3 months ago and use it almost every day. It heats up quickly, produces a good amount of steam, and works very well. You can fill the reservoir about halfway (using distilled water) and if you only steam a few items every day the water will last in the unit for weeks. I haven't had any problems with leaking. One minor problem: I discovered the other day that one of the clamps that holds up the telescoping pole was cracked and the pole would not stay up. I just called customer service and they're sending out a new pole right away. I'm pleased that they have responded so quickly to the problem. I'd recommend this product highly!"
2,Hose broke after less than 2 months of usage,Spend a few bucks more and buy a better model. I was very careful with mine and one more steam started pouring everywhere due to the hose breaking off. It's made with cheap plastic and I think the steam melted it down to nothing and it eventually broke. So disappointed.... I was loving it while it lasted :(
5,Super convenient and well worth the price!,"I bought this because of other reviews and I'm not at all disappointed. Just as others mentioned, it heats super fast, and the wide head and large holes make steaming out wrinkles happen quickly with one pass. I owned another steamer before and this works faster and doesn't spit up water. I also love the convenient removable water pitcher. The only con so far (I've owned it for a few months): you will need to buy or use another stand for hanging your clothes as you steam for the one on the steamer is far too short and really seems meant for hanging the steamer head only. Otherwise, wonderful! Well worth the price!"
3,Works well but doesn't last,"Initially I was very happy with this product. It works very well and heats up very quickly. I thought, what a great buy for the money!That is until I've had this for about 3 months, and I started noticing that the plastic on the pole was starting to crack. And soon after, the plastic would not hold the pole extended anymore and I had to permanently hold the pole together with duct tape. I suppose it still technically worked.Now the plastic pieces have gotten so weak that the whole thing is essentially held together by duct tape, and I have to be careful when steaming because the whole thing gets tipped over fairly easily. Time to get a better steamer."
1,didn't work,"doesn't work....have a small hand held cheap steamer that works 100x better than this one. it is also a steamfast so i thought this would be a great purchase. (god, how i wanted it to work...).i was wrong..."
1,Broke before I could try it!,"I wish I could review how well this steamer actually did its job, but it broke before I had the chance. I was connecting the steam hose to the unit and the screw snapped. I didn't realize I was applying any force until it was too late. Good luck and be careful if you do purchase."
3,"More convenient than an iron, but doesn't work as well","After reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a fast way to get the wrinkles out of my clothes. It does, but not as quickly or as completely as I expected. I don't expect perfect creases, but it really takes a lot of effort to get most of the wrinkles out of a shirt. It's OK, and I don't regret buying it, but it didn't work quite as well as the reviews led me to believe."
3,"Decent, but can definately find better","I've had three steamers so far, and I have to say I don't like the features as much. The pole does not retract high enough so you have to bend down to steam your cloths. It's a decent steamer, but there are definately some better models on the market."
1,Worked twice then broke down.,"This thing worked twice, (not very well, at that), and then broke down.If I could leave 0 stars I would. Never again will I buy from this brand.I could probably have gotten a replacement one since it broke within warranty but I was so disappointed with it I wasn't too eager to try it again. It's now collecting dust in a corner of my bathroom."
3,it is ok but not perfect,"shipping on time.hanger will move, it is not very easy to hold it steadily."
2,It doesn't worth your time and money to try,This is the first time for me to submit a review. Just want to let you know that I have to return this and ordered Jiffy Steamer J-4000 instead. It's not powerful enough.
3,"It definitely works, but way too light (weight and steam)","It definitely works, but way too light. Not stable, hose gets too hot, and steam not strong enough.I also bought Maier S18S in China for $70, which is much better than SteamFast SF-407."
4,Steamfast,"For the price, this is a very good product. I bought it to help steam out wrinkles in curtains, dust ruffles and shirts. As others have said, if you are used to having dry clean shirts, this may not be the product for you. For what I needed, it is perfect."
1,Not really good,"Well I don't iron at all, so I decided to buy this steamfast because everyone said it was so much easier to iron, but the it wasn't, all my blouses get wet, and still with wrinkles, is just not working, maybe for things that are not so wrinkle, but bottom line, is not a good purchase."
2,Very disapointed,"I purchased this product based on the reviews and then the price. I couldn't wait to get it so I could start using it. Once I finally received it, I was very disapointed. My clothes were wet alot and I still had alot of wrinkles. It seemed like I was spending more time trying to steam-iron my clothes then when I was using my regular iron! I'm about 95% sure that i will be returning this item!"
1,EDIT after one year use __not recommend,"At the beginning, I tried this on my winter coats -- it worked pretty well actually. But it never works on silk brouse or slacks...!!! I am getting an iron to get wrinkles out of my clothes...!!"
4,less wrinkles,"Definitely happy with the steamer, it works very well. Now when i dont have a thing to wear because its all in the ironing basket, I know I can turn on the steamer and be out the door in no time. It definitely gets out most of the wrinkles in a very short time, but you still have to use the iron on occasion just to touch up. My 20 year old son loves it too for his t-shirts and shorts when he doesnt get them out of the dryer in time.I hate ironing, but i especially dislike not wearing all those clothes I spent big bucks for because they are full of wrinkles.Highly recommend!"
1,Steam is not consistant,"This is the second steamer I have purchased. The first one broke because of my error, I left it on with no water. Anyway, I got this one in the hope it would perform as well as my first one, but it didn't. The steam output was very inconsistant. It would steam for a while and then stop for no reason I could see. I'd turn it on and off to no avail and the next time I tried to use it it would work fine. It only worked about a forth of the times I tried to use it. I returned the item."
2,plastic broke,"I purchased this product in Feb.2012. It is now July 2012... I have had to order a new steamer. The bottom plastic part broke almost immediately! No worries, because it still worked. Until recently, it just stopped working. I have a family of 5, and we use our steamer daily. I have since purchased the Jiffy 2000. A lot more money, but given the usage and the reviews, I am hoping this new one will not let us down. The SteamFast is now in the trash waiting for pick up. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!!!"
4,Great way to avoid ironing,"I was looking for any way to avoid ironing and I think this is as close as I'm going to get. I haven't perfected my technique so de-wrinkling still takes me quite a bit of time. I don't get the crisp look of ironing but this steamer definitely de-wrinkles enough to make my clothes presentable in public. I also haven't tried it for cleaning but I am excited to try it. Overall, great product and I would recommend it."
4,Kicks butt,This thing walks all over the Toby's butt. Takes no time to start steaming and puts out lot's. You have to use distilled water to avoid buildup but that's not a big deal. only 4 stars because the hose is very stiff until it heats up and if you use it to get stains out of the carpet it may dribble hot water on it instead. Great for just about anything you'd want a steamer for.
2,drips really bad,"it says in the manual that it will drip while it starts up and to give it time to warm up. i did this and at first it was great, but when i got to the second shirt, i noticed it was dripping. i faced the nozzle down and a flood of water came out of the hose. then it stopped creating steam all together. i had to turn it off and back on for it to start steaming up again. while it was working it did get the wrinkles out pretty well."
3,Gets too hot,"I researched after my previous steamer a Rowenta lasted less than a year. One thing the Rowenta had though, was an insulated tube. The steam tube on this one is a thick plastic/rubber like material, but it still gets hot. I almost burned my legs several times while using it wearing shorts. It makes me nervous around my daughter. The Wand gets a little hot too. Also its hard to discover from the specifications, but there is no crease attachment. Instead they give you a ""Press pad"" which is a piece of foam with an insulated cover. The length of the tube is also a little short. Since there is no brake on the wheels, it rolls into you if you are pressing something taller. I wish I'd spent more money and gotten a better model."
4,Hate ironing? Meet your new best friend.,"I hate ironing. So much that I would run out of work clothes mid-week. Whoops!I finally bit the bullet and bought this fabric steamer (after reading the great reviews on here). It works great! I used it on all kinds of clothes (blouses, camis, pants, sweaters) of all different fabrics (cotton, silk, blends, rayon) and it works beautifully on all of them! The price is great too.I wish the extended pole was longer and the water bay was bigger but on the whole I love this thing.The steam gets really hot so be careful!"
3,A little overrated,"I looked into a couple different steamers around this price range and I finally decided to go with this one because the reviews made it sound good. When I first tried it out I was not impressed. People say you can steam clothes by hanging them in your bathroom with a hot shower running. That's pretty similar to the result you get from this product. It takes wrinkles out, but does not leave fabric looking the greatest. Also, it takes a LONG time to fully steam an article of clothing. Another option is putting an iron on a steam setting and using a towel to keep the iron off the article of clothing. I have not tried this, but I would venture to guess that it would have better results than just regularly steaming your clothes. This product does what it's supposed to do. It makes steam, but the previews reviews made it sound great. It is mediocre, but not great."
2,Not real happy,"The steamer itself works well. The hose on the other hand, is very stiff and gets very hot to the touch."
1,steamfast,This steamer is very dissappointing. The only thing I like about it is the wheels on the bottom for moving around. The steamer itself gurgles the whole time (even after holding the hose up like instructions say). It spits hot water out on clothes and on the person using the appliance. It does not do a good job at all steaming the garments. I have used other steamers before and this was by far the worse.
1,broke immediately....cheap parts,"I saw so many good reviews, I ignored the bad reviews, of which there are 26. It broke while I was putting it together. The hose that screws on to the base is really poorly made part, and it broke as I screwed the hose on to the base. Really frustating...Now I have to return this giant box to amazon...I should have spent the $10-$150 needed for a good steamer...."
1,Broken out of the box,"I bought this for my best friend for her birthday. She just opened the box to put it together and it broke apart in her hand... Ironically enough, I can't see where to contact the seller. Maybe this will get their attention..."
3,shop around...,"this is an ""ok"" steamer- i'd look around for better steamers. the price is right for this steamer- can't complan!"
3,"Good to use, and easy to use","It's ok for me to use it to iron the shirts, light weight coat, may be there is a way for me to do better with it, still pracing with it."
2,"Worked for about 90 days, then died.","Great product, fast warmup, easy to use. Sad that it died after a few months of using it. Complete failure -- no warning. Had to go into work that day with a wrinkled shirt--awesome."
3,Fabric Steamer,The steamer kinged upon the first use and my engineer husband had to devise a fix. It works now but since we bought this one we saw others that would not kink for less money. Product is made with cheap materials.
3,Just okay,"Does the trick but not impressive. Steam is not always steady, pole does not lift as high as preferred - sometimes get on knees to finish bottom of shirts"
2,Truly disappointed . . . does not work well,"I got this steamer in the mail yesterday, immediately set it up, filled it with the recommended distilled water, turned it on, waited 5 minutes (as another reviewer suggested), pulled a bunch of wrinkled poly/cotton blend shirts out of the closet, and was ready to steam like crazy . . .But to my HUGE disappointment, found that it just doesn't work all that well. Wrinkles don't come out unless you make multiple passes and pull a lot on the fabric at the same time - I kept burning myself in the process. And the wrinkles just wouldn't budge from some fabrics. Seems to do the best job on 100% cotton with only mild wrinkles.I wasn't expecting crispness from a steamer. I was, however, expecting to be able to get wrinkles out with less difficulty than ironing - which just isn't the case with this steamer.In all honestly, I'll probably end up giving it away. It's not even close to a substitute for an iron."
1,Disppointed and returned for refund,"The item arrived with a damaged coupling. Checked it and found that the coupling for connecting the hose to boiler is very weak, Definitely it is a defective design on the materials. Cannot use it and spent time to return it. I purchased a Conair GS7 fabric steamer with slightly lower price, it works as I expected."
2,Nice and Compact--Poor Performance,"Cute size, however, the hose directly above the coil (approx. 3 inches) gets super hot, even intolerable to the touch, hence the steam causes it to bend and overheat. Because this part of the hose collapses when hot, additional steam does not come out of the nozzle. Am I disappointed? Not really. I got what I paid for. It 's worth it to go with an industrial or near-industrial one."
2,Didn't work as advertised,"I had really high hopes for this item, imaging a world where I never had to iron work shirts and pants again. My hopes were quickly dashed, however, the first few times I used this product. If I ironed a ""wrinkle-free"" shirt that was slightly imperfect, the steaming made it look a little nicer. Not crisp like an iron, but presentable. Non-""wrinkle-free"" shirts, on the other hand, were completely unwearable after steaming. An iron was still in order.I also had a hard time making creases. The product comes with a creasing pad, but it was awkward to use and I kept burning myself. Perhaps with practice this could have gotten easier, but after several small burns I didn't want to try anymore.I am returning this item and going back to the drawing... or shall we say ironing... board.Oh yes, and this item did not arrive as pictured. It's very similar, not anything I'd return the item over, just a comment."
3,"inexpensive and reliable, but design is CHEAP","Pros:- inexpensive - only around $50 compared to $100 and up for professional steamers- light- easy to operate, easy to refillCons:- materials are CHEAP. Namely the body is made of a thin plastic and water tank is too thin on PVC. Could be improved easily.- wheels are so tiny and flimsy - they will break off the first serious roll around your house or a store.The metal pole is thin and the connection port made of thin plastic - mine was already broke when delivered (!!), I have installed the pole with no problems though. But the fact says for itself on how thin the plastic is. It breaks way to easily.Good for house? Maybe. But I would rather spend 30-40 more $$ and would buy a better model.Good for store/business? NO. Definitely no.Would I recommend it? No, unless you don't want to spend more than $50 and still have it. Even then I would check your local craigslist for used models."
2,"Decent at first, but hose soon broke off and then steamer just stopped working.","It's a cheap plastic steamer that does an okay job, until ultimately the hose breaks off and the steamer just stops working as other reviewers here have said. You get what you pay for, I guess, but I didn't expect for this thing to crap out in less than a year. The steamer also began to leak, drip, and spit out water toward the end of its short life."
3,Ok,"Smells like plastic when it heats up. The brush doesn't stay on. It also spits a little, but does the job."
4,Good steamer,"Works great. However, it can easily topple, so be careful. Other than that, I love it much better than a steam iron."
5,Great Value!,"I love this fabric steamer! I have steamed curtins, shirts, sweaters, and pants. Works great! Great value for the price, would recommend, WAY better then an iron."
4,Good for the price,"So far, I've used it twice. The 1st time, no problems. I drained the water after my 1st use and stored it. 2nd time using it, it was going fine until I had to refill it. It took a while (like 7-10 min) to reheat and start steaming. Maybe because i unplugged it for 1 minute but still, it was too long since it usually starts to give steam within 1 minute or less. After the 7 min., it was up and running well. I even steamed my bed after that. Overall, I like it.Tip: I use purified water only to reduce chance of build up (also as directed)."
1,Mine didn't work,"This product only worked for about two minutes, then stopped producing steam. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail. I liked the design and ease of it, if it worked. I got a lemon, and don't want to take the chance of exchanging it, so back it went. Amazon makes returns easy."
1,Terrible quality!!! DO NOT BUY,Very very cheap plastic material. It is dead on arrival.Save yourself some money and go with the Jiffy brand.
3,Nice for people who are REALLY short,I am 5'4 and generally consider myself short. But this steamer requires you to be on your knees to steam a shirt. I have used other steamers that held the item to be steamed above eye level. This is not even that. I am going to put it on a box or something to make it easier to use. Pretty rediculous to have such a short extension arm to hold an article of clothing.
3,"The steamer works, but an iron definitely removes wrinkles better","I like the steamer for clothes that aren't too wrinkled; just to smooth them out a bit more if they've been hanging in the closet for a while or something like that. However, I've found that if something is really wrinkled, then an iron is a better choice. Also, on the steamer there is a hook like thing where you can hang your garment while your steaming, but for whatever reason, it seems like the steamer has to be higher than the pipe letting out the steam so you cannot really use the hook while you're steaming. in my experience I've either had to hold the garment up high or hang it on a hook on the back of my door because the pipe cannot be bent really at all or the steam will not come out the way its supposed to. I've tried the steamer about 3 times and it works just ok, but I won't be trading in my iron any time soon either."
4,SteamFast - SteamGreat!,"I must say, I have not used my old iron since I received the SteamFast. I works wonderful! It is easy to use, heats up fast, and takes up very little space. It is super for suit jackets since you can't hardly iron a suit jacket! I love it and recommend it, and I am the type of person that has to have everything ironed. Well, now steamed!"
2,Customer service was great.,"The SteamFast Steamer did not steam and get wrinkles out as I thought it would. The hose was a wee bit short too. Took a very long time for the system to steam and at that time it did not get the wrinkles out of the clothing. I like purchasing from amazon because if there is any problem with any item, they take care of their customers."
4,"1st Steamer, great product for the price","This is my first steamer as well. I have a wedding to attend this week end and thought it would be a good buy to refresh that great looking dress I got last week... I was curious about it as well. I did my homework, checking the reviews between different models and the SF407 (like I call it) was standing out in price/avg satisfaction.I received it this afternoon and of course tried it right away with some curtains and various things around the house.The use of the protective pad to press is great and does a great job.I kinda saw online that steam kills dust mite (cool ! My husband is allergic so I guess it will help for that as well)The main point that bugged me a little is the hose getting hot after about 10 min (they could have a better isolation)Also, they recommend to use distilled water and I am not sure I want to spend a couple of extra $ each time I use it.Great product for the price !"
2,The plastic smell is awful. Save your money to invest in something that won't emit plastic fumes.,"I loathe ironing so I decided to try out a steamer, since I had a good experience using one to de-wrinkle clothes back in the day when I volunteered at a thrift store.Maybe my memories of the thrift store steamer were a bit too optimistic, because this steamer definitely isn't as efficient as the one I had remembered. It does the job eventually, but not without inconsistent steaming. Also, there's an awful plastic smell when you first turn on the steamer, which can't be good for your health.I may keep using this occasionally when I really need a good pressed shirt or suit, but I'm going to keep looking for something better. I don't recommend wasting your time on this one -- save your money for something that's more efficient and not so bad for your health."
2,Great item - stopped working after 7 months,I loved this steamer - it was fabulous - but it just stopped working after 7 months! now it will turn on for 5 mins (at the most) and then stop emitting steam. Disappointing!
3,Price was right for the product,"This steamer works well with getting out wrinkles, however, if youre looking to get crisp shirts, collars, and creases in pants, then this is not the steamer for you. Stick to that good ole iron, steam press, or your local dry cleaners."
1,Broke upon assembly,Plastic nut to attach pole to canister broke as I was assembling it. Handle and steam tube get very hot to the touch. Brush attachment falls off easily. No control over stream release - steams non-stop. Can not recommend this product.
3,High Temp - Good Performance,"Pros:Gets the job done - used primarily on work close, pants shirts, etc of different fabric types. For heavier fabrics you may need to go slower and do an extra pass.Cons: I have found that little black pieces of plastic have been coming up through the reservoir. I tried to flush it out but there always seems to be more. Not a huge sign of quality, but the price is right for a 1500 watt unit - so far so good.Special Note:Watch your hands! This thing is hot!!!! Necessary for a good steamer but if your clumsy invest in a pair of silicone heat resistant gloves."
4,Good but needs wheel lock,"I am pleased with the product and find it suits my at home needs (I'm probably 10 garments/wk). The one downside is on my hard wood floor the roller wheels can be frustrating, so brakes/locks would be great. Also the base could handle more weigh to reduce tipping once water is low. The positive out weighs the bad and a little getting used to it has lessened the impact."
3,SteamFast SF-407,"This SteamFast steamer is exactly as described. I'm a bit disappointed as it doesn't miraculously remove wrinkles from clothes as I had hoped. It DOES work but it would be easier to just iron the clothes, they come out crisper with ironing."
5,steamer,fantastic! worth every penny. I bought cotton clothes now and do not have to worry about taking so much time to iron
4,Awesome product for the price!,"I've owned various steamers, some cost three times more than this one and I must state this is the best of the bunch! It's ready to go in 30 seconds and doesn't require multiple passes to take wrinkles out of my curtains or lightweight shirts and slacks. Best of all I don't have to drag out my ironing board anymore! As for storage this steamer takes up very little space in my linen closet. LOVE THIS!Why only 4stars?I wish it had a bigger water capacity esp for when I'm doing really big jobs like steaming the 35 curtians hanging around my house that I wash every 4months."
1,SteamFast SF-407,"What a disappointment--- 30seconds of steam, sputters, spits out water and then nothing. sending it back. Read great reviews almosst wonder did I get a lemon or are the good reviews rigged..Was so excited to get going with this. Don't bother."
4,Steamfast,Gave it as a Christmas present. My friend said she tried it on two Items of clothing and it worked fine.
2,Great while it lasted,"I used this steamer several times a week, and it was by far the best steamer I have ever purchased. With that being said, less than six months after use the hose broke at the base....there is no feasible way to fix this. I am highly disappointed that this didn't last very long."
2,loved it until the plastic tube broke,I bought this steamer after my highend and overrated steamer went kaput. I read all the wonderful reviews and the great price and decided to take a chance on it. I was not disappointed. I used the steamer constantly and on all clothing and it did everything it was supposed to do until one day the hose came off! I thought at first I just needed to screw it back on but the plastic actually broke off without any effort!! Cheap plastic. Needs improvement. I am so disappointed. Now I'm off to buy another kind which I hope will last longer than this one did.
4,Does a great job!,"I gave my hand held steamer to my daughter. Decided I needed something 'stronger'. This product is a solid steamer; heats up very quickly. Only negative - the hose is only 5 feet which can limit usage if steaming curtains, or anything hung more than six-feet."
5,It's great.,"I read a lot of reviews for a bunch of steamers and noted the negatives. This one had mostly positive reviews, so I bought it. I used it for a very large drapery and it was wonderful. It didn't spit water, come unattached to the base, delay between steam output, handle get hot or any of the other negatives I saw in other reviews."
4,Works well,The steamer works well however the height is for a person under 6 ft tall unless you don't mind having to sit to use it.I had to sit to use it.I also had to refill the water supply to frequently. Every 15 minutes! I was steaming 6 shirts. I had to refill twice.Not that much of a big deal but it would have been better without that added refillCreases back into trousers do not happen.It does take the wrinkles out though.It worked well on all of my shirts that had just come out if a suitcase.All in all it's quite good.I did purchase it at Amazon.
2,Broken before it began,"Pulled it out of the box, put it together, screwed the hose to the base and the plastic nut on the hose cracked immediately. Not sure why there is metal strain relief on the hose when the connection is thin plastic. Unfortunately i have to ship it back before i'd even turned it on. Do not recommend, unless you plan on being very careful to make sure the wand never leaves the holder or your hand."
2,works but holds potential danger,"The steamer works well and is a fast/efficient gadget that gets the wrinkles out. The hose gets extremely hot (obviously) but lacks any insulation or cover to protect. I burned my arm, wrist on it this morning...so beware."
5,Awesome,"Nothing to share, it simply works perfectly and got here quickly. Amazing product, I will never use an iron again."
1,Bad quality,"Bought this steamer in March this year after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, 6 months on and the hose has snapped! I tried sourcing a new hose online and found nothing - so I'm now left with a totally useless machine! I have not been put off steaming my clothes, so I will invest in a more expensive steamer, one which will last more than 6 months!"
5,much better than I thought,"I put off buying this record for a long long time because having read that he was suppossedly trying to break the american market with this album, I just couldn't picture this to be good. But - I was wrong already the opener ""The Teachers Are Afraid of the Pupils"" is sure enough a depart from his usual format of 3 minute songs but it packs as much impact as for example led zep's ""kashmir""good good good I've been listening to it everyday since I bought it."
4,One song makes the remastered album worth while,"Just listen to ""You Should have been nice to me"" I dont know why Morrissey did not include this trackin the original version or put it out as a b side. The song is beautiful and moving. The lyrics are deep and makes you wonder how can some one that once loves you can with time treat youlike garbage."
3,It's a fine line between clever and stupid...,"SOUTHPAW GRAMMAR is good rush-hour driving music. However, I have enough of that in my collection without Morrissey releasing such a thing. It's actually kind of a fun album in a lot of ways. Moz really seethes at his targets (cf. ""The Boy Racer"" and ""Reader Meet Author""), and the hard-rock sound suits the songs well. But the first and last songs are each 10 minutes long, and there's just no excuse for that-- I'll listen to Yes if I want epics. And while the lyrics are, as usual, loads of fun, one gets the feeling after awhile that Moz decided to make a self-parody after the comparatively challenging VAUXHALL AND I. This is alright, but it is kind ""spinal tap,"" knowhutimean?"
2,A so-so showing from one of the greats,"Not what it could have been. While showing glipses of his usual brilliance i.e the last track, this album seem a to be a forced after-thought. As if someone said ""hey Morrissey we need an album, got anything hanging around?"" One would do better to look to the lavish ""Vauxhall and I"" or the playful ""Bona Drag"" as a first encounter."
2,not a good attempt,morrissey...what is this unlikeable music. a horrible attempt what happened to your arsenal or vaxaul...anything plaese
1,Pretentious execution & production kill good melodies,"I don't believe Morrissey will ever live up to the standard Smiths fanatics demand, but on this CD he barely manages a coherent standard at all. 'The Teachers Are Afraid of the Pupils' takes what I can only call an 'orchestral riff' and repeats it for 11 minutes. 'The Operation' is catchy and genuinely swings, but is undercut by offensively dull 2-minute long drum solos. Half of these tunes make no impact whatsoever, except to suggest Morrissey wants to be a singer in a garage punk band. Moz, we don't want you to be Johnny Rotten, we want frilly multi-instrument emotionally direct concise tunes. (Like what you did before this mess, and then did after with 'Maladjusted.') I'm always a fan, but this CD is a career-killer. Only 'Reader Meet Author' works well, and you can get that on the far better 'My Early Burglary Years' compilation."
5,"Folks, its not that bad","The songs on this album were a necessary departure for the time when it came out in 1995,it was after Vauxhall and I people!!-the softest of his albums- this is Morrissey at his hardest. I only wish that they would have included the two b-sides that came out with the Dagenham Dave single: you must please remember & nobody loves us. I have enjoyed it over the years and like it equally to You are the Quarry even though it isnt as melodious as the latter."
1,An excellent coaster for a jumbo beverage,"This album has exactly ONE good song: Do Your Best and Don't Worry. The rest is a failed experiment in arty hard rock. I like Morrissey, but this album is guano."
1,Morrissey:a small talent requires a small review,"""Southpaw Grammar"":They'd not written enough tracks,so they stretched two of them on the Song Rack.Low Point:""The Operation""-back in 1983,did anyone think a Morrissey record would feature a drum solo?"
5,"Epic, wonderful","What a ride! Diamond takes us into a realm of exciting adventures that I haven't known since I was a small child. It's one of a kind. Based on his HAVEN series, it takes you away into the world of forests and the minds of wolves and canines and birds and....well, why not just read it yourself.A hard to get book now (collectors seem to gobble it up) it's worth the time and effort of tracking it down."
3,Just a re-telling of The Haven,"Thought this was was a new, stand alone story in the Haven series, but it's only a re-telling of the original story. Was a major disappointment to me and I wouldn't have bought the book had I known, because I already own a copy of The Haven."
1,"This television cannot display a 1080p signal (Blu-ray, PS3, PC)","I am terribly disappointed. I feel as though I've been lied to. Everywhere in their literature, Sharp touts their ability to display 1080p on this device. Unfortunately, the device doesn't accept a 1080p signal as input. It can accept a 720p signal and up convert it to be displayed as 1080p but that adds no quality, it just resamples the image at a higher resolution, often looking worse than the original source image. I've owned the TV for more than 30 days and just recently tried to display a 1080p TV but I'm still going to try to return the TV."
2,"Program is wonderful, but cannot play blue ray version","excellent program, but cannot play blue ray version, both the Greece and this France dvd. My blue ray samsung player is four years old, so if you have one of the newer players, then BUY!"
3,Crash Bang Pow,"'Horsedrawn Wishes' is a cocophonous mish-mash of sounds, and just like his brother in My Bloody Valentine, Jimi Shields is pushing the limits of rock experimentalism. On the surface is an unconventionally produced 'shoegaze meets Krautrock' combination. Powerful, tense and surreal. The albums strength is in combining opposites: crashing waves of guitars and clanking industrial noises to dreamy vocals, trilling synths, and soothing instrumentals. Overall the sound is as tight as a wound-up ball of musical rubberbands, yet underneath it all, lies some brilliant arranging/mixing. Bittersweet elements that somehow found it's way to harmoniously co-exist with each other. A carnival cavalcade of sounds, and just like any carnival, it's about admiring the lights in the haze, discovering the beauty amidst the chaos."
4,an intriguing listen,"This album could be described as being ahead of its time, or not of any time at all. It combines stream of concsiousness lyrics with swathes of guitar with beautiful melodies as catchy as you will ever hear. The stand out track is ""Speed to my side"". Rollerskate Skinny are well worth a listen , even if they have less than a dozen fans in the world."
5,Sonic Masterpeice! ! ! !,"One of the most overlooked albums of the 90s ,I remember wanting to buy it the date of release and found it in the bargain bin a week later (how Fu*ked is that ?) Its a classic that will one day be fully realised ,this is the next SGT Peppers ! , Rollerskate Skinny were too ahead of their time . Do your ears a favor and listen to this sonic masterpiece at full volume .-------------------------------------------------------(the above reviews are all incorrect )Jimi Shields left in 1993 [he is now in Lotus Crown] and nowhere on this album [thank god]Ken Griffin is [Kid Silver]Steve .M & Ger Griffin (no relation to Ken) are in [Walker]Steve M. is now in [The Radio]"
3,Hmmm?,"I don't have this book, but using the ""LookInside"" feature, I found many typos.For instance, there are three typos in the first entry of the ADC Definitions,i.e. Acquisition Time. There are several more immediately following.It doesn't seem that anyone took the time to proof-read this book."
5,Anonymous,"I have not yet read this, but this author's work in EDN magazine is second to none. If her book is as well done as her EDN articles, this book is a must-have."
5,Gained 10 Pounds,"Best kitchen appliance I've bought in a long time. I'm now cooking more than ever. Great for kneading-potato dumplings, bread, cake-you name it, KA can handle it. Slow start smartest thing on mixer."
5,Accolade 400,"d an artisan before and it was nice, but the accolade is better.It may be loud but it doesnt really matter.I typically do my cooking before my company arrives so I dont see how the noise is a hassle.Blenders are noisy as well as many other appliances,so I dont see the problem with it that the previous person posted as such a big deal."
4,As expected,"Bought this mixer as a Christmas present for my wife. She makes a lot of homemade icing, and we could not find a mixer at the local ""big"" stores that would handle the job. This mixer does great. My only suggestion is to buy a Kitchen Aid Mixer with METAL gears. No complaints."
1,Two strikes and it's out,"I thought ""don't buy the first release"" applied to computer software, not kitchen appliances, but I've learned my lesson. The first time out of the box it was clear something was really wrong with the gears - it went from ""stir"" to way-too-fast, finally shutting itself off. None of the gears worked.I exchanged it and the second one lasted for only one batch of meringues. It developed an evil sounding knock.I don't want to try a third one, and right now I'm thinking about my options.In any case, if you buy an Accolade, make sure you save the box and packing material."
1,DOA,Dead on arrival. No more available. Not Amazon's fault. KitchenAid quality has gone away. Buy a Hamilton Beach Commerical Mixer.... a much better product.
5,Love it! Love it! Love it!,"I recently ordered this mixer in time for the holidays. I took advantage of the great sale on Amazon this month and I have to say I simply love my mixer! I've already used it for at least 6 batches of cookies and just completed a batch of royal icing last night. I already know it's the best investment I've made for my kitchen. I ordered the Cinnamon color and couldn't wait until it arrived. I received my mixer in 2 days! I was shocked and delighted when I came home from work to discover the package had arrived ahead of schedule. I had to break it in the same night I received it. Thanks to Amazon for the sale/speedy delivery and thanks to KitchenAid for making such a valuable product in so many colors! It was hard to choose.The motor is a little loud but w/ the wattage on this unit, I can excuse it. I haven't made bread dough and will wait and see."
4,Excellent Product,"I have used this mixer to make over 2000 biscotti so far and it has performed as expected. It's easy to use and easy to clean. If it included a wire wisk in addition to the regular beater, I'd have given it 5 stars, though, to be honest, the regular beater whips cream like a champ. It has plenty of power for everything I've thrown at it and it's heavy enough to stay put on the counter and not try to walk around while mixing. I definitely recommend it. As usual, the delivery was trouble-free."
4,I'm a little Tea Pot!,"I love, love, love this tea pot. It is sweet and so detailed. I do not use it as a tea pot but collect Pinocchio memorabilia and some tea pots. Ihis is one of my favorites! I'm sure it work well as a tea pot, however!"
3,Spicy but but not hot,It is good and tasty but I wanted a bit more kick. Probably works well for most Americans but I wanted it to have a more of a kick and pepper flavor. But the bottle is already halfway gone - my wife likes it but adds crushed red peppers to make it really kick butt! Buca de Beppos stopped carrying the spicy pizza oil last year and we are still looking for a replacement....
5,Beautiful Case,"I bough this case for my Nikon D80, it fits perfect with the 18-135mm lanse attached and still have planty of room for more lanses, I like it's compact, very prety and classic looking. It's looks much better than the photo on the website, Good quality product from Vanguard."
1,The one CD to get,"I want to change to 5 stars but can't seem to edit it now.This CD has a great selection of Auntie Genoa Keawe's greatest hits.Initially, I got a bad copy that had tracks plagued with rumble and rythmic ticking noises. So I sent an Email to Hula Records and they are going to send me a replacement copy and I'll see if it is better.Interesting to note that I got a prompt personal reply from the president of Hula Records who informed me that mine was the first complaint they have had about that title... so I think it is safe to say that I just was unlucky in receiving a bad copy.Otherwise, I love this CD's songs and the liner notes are good at telling the significance of each song and provide lyrics and translations for all but a few songs. The few that are missing from the liner notes can be found easily on the internet...so no worries.I would say that if you only own one Genoa Keawe CD...this is the one to get. All her greatest hits and all on one CD."
3,Promising Start,"Before honing her skills in the Oahu night club scene, Hawaii vocalist and dancer Sunway debuted with this ""homegrown"" CD release.Marred by a limited budget for production, a relatively weak selection of original songs and covers, and the singer's own young, developing musical talents, the album suffers from inherent problems.Despite the flaws, Sunway's sweet alto pushes ahead with as much aplomb as was possible under the circumstances. As a result, the recording is mostly a vague tease of better things to come, and ultimately ends up falling short of any potential it might have had.Negatives aside, Sunway is definitely a star that has yet to rise. With her exotic good looks and pop-ready sound, there is definitely promise of a market for all things Sunway. Until she releases another CD, however, it is a promise unfulfilled."
5,neostrata,"The woman who waxes my face is amazed at how great my complexion looks. She said ""whatever it is that you are doing, don't stop"""
3,Too Costly,"Pretty good lotion, too wxpensive so I searched elswhere for smoothing lotions & found some.Doe not deliver the miracle dr. oz said!"
2,Not some undiscovered gem,"Sorry, I have to depart from what seems to be the consensus here...apart from the ""hit"", ""Better Than Nothing"", there's nothing here to recommend this disc...it is, not to be unkind, eminently forgettable. A classic case of a one-trick pony..."
2,"Huge fan, but not this one...","I guess I'm the only one who thought this was the worst in her Capitol crime series. Perhaps it was the subject matter, but the entire plot seemed contrived to me. I finished it, but I had trouble. I wish it had been a page burner for me, because I have loved and always look forward to each new book in this series."
2,"She knows Washington, but not Havana","The main problem with this book is its lack of ""Cubanosity"" in the way that the Cuban characters act and talk and behave - they are depicted as the way Truman imagines Cubans would act, and as a result, while the book delivers an adequate thriller plot, her placement of the action in Cuba, without much knowledge of Cuban culture and mannerisms, and social issues (such as racism) gives this book some pretty big holes. For example - Cubans refer to themselves as white or black or mulatto, etc. not as ""Hispanics"" and Truman consistently misuses this term as a racial delimiter (a very common American mistake) rather than a cultural amplifier. The book failed to make me believe that the story was actually set in Havana."
3,Smaller physical book size and print,"Although, this book was packaged and delivered extremely timely, I am disappointment that the physical book and font sizes are small. It will be more difficult to read that the full-size book. I thought I was getting a great deal with its published price, but I will be extra careful next time in using this supplier."
4,Another Excellent Story,"I've read all of Miss Truman's ""Murder"" books. She never disappoints. Ex CIA agent Max Pauling is up to his ears in trouble again. Very fast and exciting read. Celia Sardina was a wonderful foil and she really gave him a run for his money."
2,Not that easy,"i was not happy with this toy, the directions were a little tough to understand, they walls didn't snap in too easily and to top it off, there is no way the roof can snap on, i didn't even attach the roof, i have to try and let my husband attach it but right now its sitting on the shelve.not happy!"
5,Very good,Murphy's Law was a very good read. It was well written and brought to light how hard it was to be new in America.
4,"Good, light mystery","Molly Murphy escapes to the United States after killing a man. She witnesses a murder onboard and tries to save one of her shipmates from being charged with it. During the police investigation, she meets a dashing police officer with a nice romance beginning. The story is predictable in many ways. However, it is quick, descriptive and predictable with a lively writing style that holds the reader's attention throughout. Molly is her own woman who will not be beaten down by her circumstances; this was definitely a challenge in the early 1900s in Ireland and the U.S. I'm definitely looking forward to#2."
3,somewhat unbelievable,"I like the author Anne Perry, so I thought I would give this book a try. The story line and actions of the main character were too unbelievable, unrealistic. Coming to a new, unfamiliar country, no one would consider doing what she did, especially a woman, let alone get away with it without repercussions; her luck never seemed to run out. I read this book in about three hours, don't think I'll be reading another by this author."
2,Murphy's Law,I was disappointed in it. I felt let down at the end. It seemed too pat and predictable. It doesn't compare well to the Maisie Dobbs series which I loved.
3,Disappointing,"After reading many books in the .99cent catagory and often being disappointed with the predictable endings etc, I decided to 'splurge' on a $7.99. I should have stuck to the cheap ones, as this was also predictable, far-fetched and the usual ""gutsy woman against all the odds"" story. Don't waste your money."
2,Interesting... If you run a restaurant or pastry shop,"This book has a compelling premise: capturing family recipes for the best of Viennese pastry. The big disappointment, however, is that the recipes are all scaled for foodservice portions, without reference for reducing them to domestic applications. While I'd love to try an authentic linzertorte, I don't have need most days to make 8 cakes worth. I wouldn't recommend the book unless you run a restaurant, pastry shop or other large volume business, or you're interested enough in the topic to justify reading it as an academic learning experience, without practical application. I sent it back - I wish I had known the target reader group was not the home baker."
3,Big food pairing,"Well, after scaling down the recipes, I was able to make some really good desserts. Don't know if this is for the ""novice"" home cook, though. Paired a linzertorte with a great glass of Austrian dessert wine (Wenzel Saz, found it at www.winemonger.com) at a party to big cheers."
3,Not the light's fault it's just OK.,"We bought this light for a bathroom remodel we were doing to sell our house - and then decided not to put our house on the market. It is not the style I would pick for a house we are staying in, hence ""it's not the light's fault, I don't love it.""The light has a very nice brushed nickel finish with no nicks and came very quickly from the seller (One Stop, in our case.) The shades are white frosted and also had no nicks or unintentional changes in the evenness of the white color. The one drawback to this light is that the shades are short, and therefore if you use the standard energy efficient spiral type light bulbs they will jut down about an inch or two below the shade rim: which looks bad. Meaning, you either have to use regular bulbs or buy very expensive specialized spiral bulbs."
3,BATTERIES AND INSTRUCTIONS NOT INCLUDED.,"It wont help you write horror.I write horror stories, and the process is very simple, but Nolan never gets around to furnishing the reader with instructions to duplicate what he does."
1,Simplistic and Redundant,"I had hoped that this book would be intellectually satisfying. Instead, I found the book to be terribly written, overly simplistic, and adding nothing additional to this area of law.All of the anecdotes were obvious and uninspiring. The book tries to cover too much, in the end, becoming an exercise in intellectual futility and redundancy. If you read the introduction, then you have a concise summary of the book, making a full read absolutely superfluous and an absolute waste of time.This reads like an elementary school textbook. You'll learn more about professional responsibility watching The Practice."
1,If you can't afford Swiss stick with Rollerblade brand,"I've been skating for 20+ years and have extensive experience with Bones Bearings, as well as many of my friends over the years.Bones has had an extremely good reputation for decades as well, so after seeing all the positive reviews I had no problem ordering a set of Reds.Well the bearings I received are looser than any WORN OUT bearings I've ever had! On top of that there is a gritty sound - this coming directly from the BEARINGS, I have not even put them in my wheels!To repeat: These bearings are looser, grittier, and noisier than the worn out Rollerblade brand bearings I was about to replace!I knew I should have stuck with Bones Swiss, but this isn't even a case of ""you get what you pay for"" - I got flat out burned here.Bones makes some incredibly good high end stuff but these economy versions are absolute crap."
3,An okay game,I hired this game and it's good. The graphics were not polished just before it was released because they were working on Conflict Desert Storm 2...was well. You get the great bits from the movie when they were going through that man made tunnel to escape(it's tense if you watched the movie)and the infamous bike cene and when the guy guides the person that was blind in the train and many more.
4,The Great Escape,"This is the best game I've ever played, its so tense that you have to carry on. If it was out of 100% I would give it 99% sucsess and 1% failture so basicly its thumbs up all around!"
2,Letdown,"You know, i am kinda confused by all the positive reviews. i couldnt' get into it from the start because of the awkward controlling scheme. The alternate patters for the controls also were awkward, so that alone hindered it. the graphics are also a little odd, and as hard as i tried, i couldn't get into the story, even though i loved the movie. great idea, just not executed well."
4,"VERY FUN,HECK NEARLY AS GOOD AS MGS3:SNAKE EATER!","The Great Escape is nearly as good as MGS3,to me this game is better than any Splinter Cell game-I ain`t a SC series fan anyway,its better than Mission:Impossible:Operation SURMA-a SC clone.Its just about nearly as good as MGS and Hitman.Its based on the early 60`s movie-The Great Escape.The movie is mentioned in Snake Eater ironically as the Major,Major Tom(i won`t spoil MGS3) names himself after one of the tunnels,anyone who watched the movie would know that ""TOM"" was one of the unlucky tunnels.It weird that some of the movies mentioned in MGS3 have a game,as well as TGE also 007 From Russia With Love is mentioned,.and there is a 007 FRWL game now.Next there will be ""It"" Came From Outta Space game!Bye."
3,A GOOD GAME,"THERE WERE QUITE A FEW NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THIS GAME, BUT BEING A WWII BUFF, I WENT AHEAD AND GOT IT ANYWAYS. I WAS NOT EXPECTING MUCH BUT THE GAME TURNED OUT TO BE VERY INTERESTING. IT IS NOT AS POLISHED AS THE NEW PS2 GAMES COMING OUT NOW, BUT THE GAMEPLAY IS VERY GOOD. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS, MORE SO IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE MOVIE. ITS WORTH ITS TIME."
5,Great Comedy!,This was a great stand up comedy film. It was tasteful and full of laughs. My family and I watched it over Thanksgiving. My sister and I were on the floor laughing. So good. Encourage all who want great comedy to buy it :)
1,A little disappointed,I have saw him on TBN and youtube he was extremely funny. So when I saw that he had a dvd coming out I had to get it. But I was disappointed with this. I didnt laugh much and was assured that I would. But I will still support...
2,Not worth the money,"I heard him in church and thought this man is funny, I'm going to get his CD/DVD and laugh my belly full. Boy was I majorly DISAPPOINTED his jokes were so lame, sound as though he was looking for material while on the stage - I fell asleep listening to him. He's good for sleep deprivation, trust me you will fall asleep within the first few minutes. Not worth spending your money on."
1,Not so good.,"I saw John Gray live at an ATF in Amherst. he was way better there. he threw some of his dvds out to the audience and got us all psyched for his old stuff, but it really wasnt that great. maybe if youre black you'll understand his jokes like most of the old people in the audience, but for real, this dvd was just a sermon with a little bit of ""funny"" inbetween."
1,warning ! rerelease of a 2003 gennita low novel,"oh disappointment, let me count the ways ... 1 those of us who are patiently waiting for a new release from low (can we say, virtually one?) appear to wait in vain, and 2 we're yet again scammed with the rerelease of an old title under the guise of a new title/series. seriously - not okay. that said, hey, low is a talented author. if u've not read her, u should do so. but, me, i'm done with authors who fail to offer truth in advertising. especially, when it's the long-standing fans who pay the price ... literally."
4,Gets better as you go.,"I didn't like this book at first. Readers are thrown directly into a plot already in progress and the relationship between Steve (Stash) and Marlena is almost immediate. It took me a while to catch up, so I didn't start liking it until about a third of the way through. But from then on, it is a good romantic suspense."
3,Really a three and a half,"I recently read Ms. Low's book ""Facing Fear"" and I loved it. So I ordered her first novel ""Into Danger"", which was a prequel to ""Facing Fear"". The bad news is I wasn't impressed with it. The good news is that based on her second book she's improved wonderfully!This book was way too repetitious! Marlena's constant desire to be in control of everyone and everything was way over the top, not to mention annoying! In the real world there is no such thing as control. It's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy how a particular person will react and there are always variables which can change the outcome of any situation. Marlena was way too arrogant and not particularly likeable. I didn't really see a connection between her and Steve beyond the physical. And Steve was just sort of ""there"".It's not necessary to read this book in order to get the maximum enjoyment out of ""Facing Fear"", a book I would highly recommend!"
2,Unbelievable heroine and confusing plot left me cold,"I was baffled at first by the confusing story line. Who did the hero work for? Was he a Navy Seal (too many authors are using them these days) or a CIA agent? Or did he work for a made up branch of the service? And the heroine???? I never did figure out what she was supposed to do for a living. Se was snotty one second, insipid the next and totally unbelievable. I didn't like her or her sidekick friend and I thought the dialogue was too dumb to be real.The writing was weak, with too much repetition of words and overwriting. I doubt I'll buy another book by this author. It was not an enjoyable read."
2,Poor writing skills and a confusing story,"Ms. Low's suspense novel with a Navy SEALs hero and undercover heroine is a trite and confusing read. The dialogue is redundant and her writing skills leave much to be desired. As if watching a train wreck, I kept reading this book hoping for it to get better or simply self destruct. Sadly, it did neither.It was difficult to figure out which covert government agency was training the hero, and I never did understand who the heroine was working for. Their 'hot' love scenes were merely tepid and their banter was silly to the point of idiocy.I will never buy another book by this author, and advise she take a course on dialogue or find an editor who will help sharpen her skills."
5,Awsome story,"I truly enjoyed this book, the character were, funny and with lots of wits. I love Gennita Low as a writer, she create very good characters, I love the heroes and the heroines are not wimpy. Good for you. Keep up the good work."
5,Absolutly Wonderful,This book was great. The characters really drew you into the heart of the story. There was constant action and it kept you guessing what was going to happen next. Both characters have just enough danger and vulnerability in them to keep it realistic. Gennita Low also opened up a new story with the ending. I hope there will be a sequel.
3,A Kid's review,"Nice graphics and the Dinosaurs are Interesting in it and cool but, it's kinda boyish I mean all these sounds. I Didn't like this Game because I am not a boy, but I play Godzilla because I don't Have to Kill humans in it. Just defeating Monsters but in this Game I have to defeat them here and I don't like That. and the game is a little bit too hard. But the graphics are nice."
4,For All Dinotopia Fans!!!!!,I love this game!!! The dinosaurs look and sound real!!! The challenges are'nt that diffucult. Buy this for dino fans!!!
2,Is only a rare game,"Dinotopia is this kind of game rares, not for everybody, but in deep is a good adventure game, if you like dthe underground games, go for it."
1,EWW GROSS I HAVE A PIMPLE,I did not like this game simply because it is like bad man....you know like water? If you were to buy this game and you were to buy a dead cat you would have more fun playing with the dead cat. If that dead cat were to come alive and die again you would be sad. If this game started fun and then sucked you wouldn't care because of the fact that cats don't die. If you are to buy a game look into Final Fantasy! They have LIVE cats and they don't have dinosaurs. Who would make a game about dinosaurs..I MEAN COME ON REALLY!! PEOPLE COME ON!!! You would have WAY more fun watching your grandma burning a popsicle stick.
5,SQL,"had only some time to check it out, appears to be good, Amazon, the only thing is packaging. books were practically out of packet, someone must have opened it."
4,Nice introduction to logistic regression,"It is a long wordy introduction to logistic regression. The good point about this book is that it has a lot of exercises (most of them simiple) that strength your understanding. It also has answers. However, the material can be condensed into 1/4 of its 700 pages easily. Other books like Agresti's books on categorical analysis are far more condensed and more difficult to digest. I think this is a good book for beginners to learn logistic regression or regression in general."
5,Must have,Simply the best logistic regression book I've seen. Concepts clearly and succinctly explained and illustrated.A must-have for all biostatisticians.
5,Logistic Regression,Kleinbaum has done it again. His books are so informative and easy to understand. It is worth the money.
1,It has never been working.,"I purchased this watch in October.After a few days, this watch was mailed to me, but it was alreadybroken.I sent it back to Amazon to get refund, but they did not do anything.I e-mailed and called them several times, but I did not get refund yet."
1,"C++ Plus Data Structures, Third Edition","This is the worst textbook I have ever had. I have no idea how anyone could learn to program from this mess. No complete examples, not very coherent chapter lay-out, extremely unclear. The best use of this book is for firewood."
2,Look Elsewhere for a text,"I found this book unsuitable for my data structures students. I did not like the examples presented, and often thought the author was going off on tangents that had little to do with the actual data structures at hand. The author seemed to get bogged down in insignificant details. My students have strongly rebelled against this text.I would suggest looking further for a text."
1,Boooooorriiiingg....,"Dale should write a book called ""How to make interesting things boring.""This book is:BoringDifficult to followNot really clearFilled with useless pictures and confusing informationAnd you understand concepts only after you learn it from somewhere else, and then you can say, ""So this is why Dale did this and did that.."""
1,I was initially skeptical that this book was as bad as it has been reviewed.,"The assignment for the first week of my 250 Comp Sci was to read the first 120 pages of this text. I stopped at 100 pages. I don't see the point anymore. This can't possibly be a text for a 2nd year student in programing. Advanced design concepts are being thrown at me now without explanation. The only useful portion is the table of contents.More horrifying, is that a professor from the University I wish to transfer to gave this book a positive review. [...]His classes will be avoided..."
2,Sold it back...,"This was a required text for a Computer Science II class at Baylor University. The book was hard to follow, and there are not enough coding examples. I sold it back to the bookstore, taking a lose as usual."
2,Sell it back in Amazon for another student,I had used this book only for a course. I was compelled to sell it once my course was done. I am glad I did.
1,Worst book ever,"I must state that any of Nell Dale's books that I have used I have found very poorly written and organized. The problems can be hard to understand, let alone trying to answer them. It goes into excessive detail when little is needed. I must say that ANY student required to use this book better be prepared for a hard class...because this book will be the bane of your existance until you can safely get rid of it."
1,Unacceptable as a beginning Data Structures text.,"This book is touted as a ""second-semester text"" so I was expecting a nicely organized book with many examples of actual code that would help me transition to a deeper understanding of C++.After doing quite well in the introductory C++ course I was quite dissapointed when I began to read through this text.The first sin of this book is the lack of actual code. Yes, there are code examples in this book, but not many.The majority of this book is theoretical explanations of data structures.The second major problem is the chapter exercises are quite vague in explaining what they want the reader to accomplish. Overall this book has a ""disorganized"" feel with no framework to hold it together. This text is more of a ""novel"" of Data Structures rather than a ""how to"".If you need this book for a course than you will have to make do,but if you are getting this to simply further your study of C++ I would look elsewhere first."
4,Great Refrence Book for Programmer w/ Basic Knowledge,"This book is a great refrence book for data structure. The style might be confusing to some, but the structure and many examples are actually carefully written in most effective way. Reader must understand C++ class, otherwise the structure does not make sense. I read it for AP Com. Sci. exam and refered to it while in college. Recommend to all advance programmer."
2,Night and Day,"Please understand these are not the comments of a bitter student, but an A one, and a good programmer too.If you liked Dale's first book, ""Programming and Problem Solving with C++"", I believe you will be deeply disappointed with this one. Maybe the difference is in the Co-Authors? While ""Programming and Problem Solving with C++"" is clear and concise learning tool with great examples, I have found C++ Plus Data Structures to be difficult to read and full of errors. The examples in this book are somewhat descent but have been ruined by constant errors. I have since read other books that give much better perspective. If you read this book during a second semester course, you are sure to leave still wondering to yourself ""what the heck is a template""."
1,"If there is a hell, This book created it.",The Author of this book shoves down your throat so much information too quickly. The examples are to complicated and are not explained enough. The information that the book should teach is not in the book. If you have a C class your thinking of taking and the teacher picks this book. Shoot yourself first before you even think about taking the course with this book. This book is harder to read than the manuals that come with your compiler. Have you ever tried to read the books that come with your c++ compiler? Its hard. This book is much harder to read than the books that come with your compiler. Unless you are insane or a have a Phd. Don't buy this book. You could spend days reading one page and never understand what this author is talking about. I would not even waste a match to burn this book.
1,Bad book!,The book is really bad and has nothing interesting inside.Do not speand your time to study it!
4,*Telephone 4 U!*,"Into the underworld of yesteryear we go. Set to some nice background music, LR raps a tight game. With the production value high, with nice atmospheric background noises that you would've heard in a fine radio show, its a great touch that makes the record come alive in your imagination. So does LR's voice characterizations.Luckily this is basically about two dudes who hustle the pool room and the card table to make their cash and not about runnin' hoes. This is pure listening fun, with a moral twist at the end. No one, then or now, would like to emulate the journey laid out in this cautionary tale."
2,Mostly of historical interest,"This CD is mostly of historical interest as a predecessor to rap (along with Rudy Ray Moore's albums). Lighting Rod, of the prerap group the Last Poets, does a series of vignettes about a, you guessed it, convention of hustlers. While the background music by the original Kool & The Gang and saxman King Curtis is good and interesting, Lightning Rod's rap is laden with 1960s street hustler argot that would be incomprehensible (for the most part) to modern listeners and those who are/were not a part of the ghetto hustler subculture. Perhaps future listeners would feel the same way listening to today's ""gangsta-rap"" music some twenty years from now."
3,Best of Randy Crawford,"A great collection of beautiful songs that give-off the audience's appreciation for the performance they are experiencing. ""This is a four star rating,not three as you have listed"""
3,Very good... but not outstanding,"I really like this CD because it had all the cuts I really wanted. She has a sweet, strong and unique voice. I love ""Imagine"" but it's a great song in itself, she doesn't add anything spectacular to it. ""Rio de Janeiro Blues"" is also one of my favs on the CD. If you love her voice, it's reason enough to buy this CD. Nothing especially memorable or outstanding, just a good CD."
5,wow...,"This is an incredible book - my new favorite, in fact. I'm not a midshipman at the Academy, though I thought seriously about it before deciding to go ROTC. I visited the Academy, and I saw so many of the experiences related in this book. While reading, it brought it all back to me. The story is not one just for the military type - it's a story about overcoming challenges, a story that anyone can take to heart. The best part of it is that in doing that, it doesn't make the characters perfect, but rather real people with faults and troubles. In fictionalizing the women in the class, it would have been easy to overlook the little problems, but Ms. Disher captures them perfectly. I had borrowed the book from a friend, but I'm going to go out and buy it so the story can continue to inspire me. Thank you!"
2,An Unfortunate Tie to History,"I agree with the Editorial Review by Publishers Weekly: ""This is a disappointing work, with too much adolescent fantasy romance mixed into its history."" I attended the Naval Academy while the author was a midshipman. For that reason only, it was interesting to read. Though some events might be true, the author's presentation and perspective were embarrassing. It makes me cringe that just because there is some truth, or just because the author was a good officer, readers rate it highly. Additionally, some chapter's epigrams seem canned, as if seeking approval by the publisher, Naval Institute Press. The writing is mediocre. The content is what sells it. The perspective is unfortunate."
5,A landmark book covering a landmark period at the Academy.,"""First Class"" portrays the struggles of the individual and the institution accurately and openly for the first time. As a male classmate of Ms. Disher's, I was both moved and shocked by the incidents in the book. Although it occured all around me, it is surprising how oblivious we can be to the trials of our neighbors, and our classmates. Thanks for a wonderful book."
4,Love this watch,I love this watch because it lights up when you press the stem & I can swim with it. This is my third one only because I wear them so much the rubber grip on the cuff wears out.
1,worst game ever,Im a big gamer and i have to say i was excited too play this game but after 5 minutes of playing it i regreted buying it. its really hard to understand. making songs on this game sound fun but its really crappy and boring save your money and dont buy this waste of time game
4,great resource,"I really appreciated all the information in this book. It's written for an academic audience, though - very dry and a lot of repetition."
4,Great comics,Tintin is a great comic series featuring the young detective Tintin. I recommend this book and all the other books in the series for children who are interested in graphic novels.
2,A little disappointing,"The quality of the printing is far from perfect. It smooches on several pages.Also, I read the French version first and the English one is, in my opinion, rather lame. A lot of work would need to be done to improve it."
2,Too small to read,"I bought this book to save a few bucks. I figured 3 books in one, why not? I was shocked to see the text as small as they could print to save money. Very disappointed."
3,Great idea but the font is too small,"We borrowed the Tintin trilogy books from our local library and loved the idea of the books coming in a hardcover as opposed to papercover form because they were supposed to be for our kids (age 4 and 6). However the books we ordered on Amazon, Vol 2 and 3 were, unfortunately, slightly smaller than the library version. This made a difference, as the font size in the Amazon copy is small and fine. My husband and I sometimes have a difficult time reading the text but our kids love the books and they are being read every day since we purchased them Feb 2011."
1,Too Small,ridiculously small font. The smallest that I have come across in ANY printer matter. Period. You should not be selling these.
3,"The Adventures of Tintin, Vol. 3: The Crab with the Golden Claws / The...Hergé","Nice book , I am a TIntin;s fan since 7 . Back then I was use to the paperback one , big and easy to read .This compact book is a little small , kinda hard to read . If you don't mind this issue then this book is great .Can't be wrong with a Tintin adventure ."
5,This was a fun read,"for children large and small, this was a great read. There were 3 books in one so its great to travel with and well laid out."
3,ok,"Wasn't too happy with these pens, they are alot bulkier than the other multi ink pens and the clickers are very flimsy, they wiggle and bend.Plus side, the ink is richly colored and it writes smoothly."
2,"Okay, but not great",This game is not the cute movies you see. It is okay but it has many problems including the controls and the gameplay. I would say stick to a rental on this one.
4,A great look at early Soviet-era poster design,"While mostly confined to the movie posters that the Stenberg Brothers produced in the early years of the Soviet Union, this book still includes enough general history to help the reader view them in the context in which they were produced. Well-illustrated (most illustrations are in full color) with easy to comprehend text, this would be a valuable volume for anyone interested in graphic design. It will also appeal to students of the Constructivist movement."
5,book highly recommended,"While somewhat critical of Saxenian's ""Regional Advantage"" the author has presented an excellent case of how self-perception and mindset of people essentially influences decision-making, which in turn drives an innovative economy up or down.It is a fascinating journey into the makings of both Silicon Valley and Silicon Fen. However, I would say that the author only reinforces Saxenians's conclusions that the culture and the value system shape the strength of an economy as much as technical expertise if not more.The book was elegantly written while it touched the deep underlying dynamics that were responsible for the creation and ultimate degree of success these two regions achieved.I would highly recommend it to everybody interested in regional development and business clustering."
4,A quick reference guide,"A great reference guide for anyone traveling to asia for the first time. The book is broken up by countries which helps in understand a little bit of the history, culture, do's and don'ts."
4,Useful And Entertaining Strategies,"This book has certain obvious strengths and weaknesses. It's very strong in presenting to the intermediate player numerous interesting and useful strategic examples: attack against the castled king, nurture your space advantage, opposite side castling, attack the base of a pawn chain, etc. The author generally uses a mix of new and classic examples. I've found the large number (101) of examples perfect for training purposes on my computer wherein I play the game positions trying to employ the book strategies. The weakness of the book is in the relatively superficial treatment of the strategies, no clear linkage between strategies, and sometimes unclear writing. I've enjoyed this book although I wouldn't say it was ""essential"" as you can generally find in your own books examples to practice using. Still, 101 mini-lessons collected in one volume? Worth buying."
5,By the Book?,"He's (or she's) playing chess by the book' is often a disdainfull remark. But every chessplayer, sooner or later, wants to increase his knowledge of chess. He won't be able to do it on his own: he will need help. Help from '101 Winning Chess Strategies' say. This book is very userfriendly. It has only 128 pages but the most important strategies are discussed. The notation uses co-ordinates (the easiest way it seems to me).Moreover, on every page are three diagrams to illustrate the moves that are discussed. A must!"
1,Disappointing,"I have grown to expect more than this from GAMBIT. This book book presents one example of a different strategic theme per page. There is no overall cohesion or theme to this book. The book was a total fabrication that did not have to be made. The publisher wanted to put out a series of ""101 ...."" books and so decided one would be made on strategy. Dunnington should not have done this. I admire his book on the King's Indian Attack; but this book harms his reputation. It has a ""Cardozo Publishing"" Eric Schiller feel to it. It also ranks ""down there"" with much junk by Pandolfini, Keene, and a few others. Please do not buy this book. It is a shame to waste money on it, when there is so much good stuff out there."
3,A little dry...,"While I think Kaku is an excellent author, this was not one of his best works. It was a little dry, and he jumped from topic to topic too quickly. Some sections were very interesting and theories well described, but at other times he briefly mentions a theory and then moves on to discuss it further without giving the non-scientist reader a quick explanation of what he's even talking about. It's rather hit-or-miss."
2,not as expected,"when I ordered the book, the condition shows ""NEW"", but when I received the book, it's an old book - pages are yellowed by age and there are marks on some pages. Disappointed when receiving it although the book itself is a really good book (meaning book contents)."
3,"Interesting at Times, but Leaves You Wanting More","Beyond Einsten tells the story of the quest to find a ""Theory of Everything"" which would unite the four forces of nature into a single force. Kaku describes the past attempts by Einsten and others to find this elusive theory. He then proposes Superstring theory, which may or may not be the theory of everthing.I found this book is confusing in parts. For example, sometimes Kaku would introduce a new term and not explain it adequately. Then he would go and use that terms umpteen times and I'd wonder what the hell it meant. If you don't have a background in physics you may have a hard time understanding it too. Also, I wanted more information about the specifics of superstring theory. He explains briefly about how it may unite the four forces but is light on details. An ok book, but not as good as his others."
4,Good Work,"Lots of review for the educated, but well put together and very readable. Recommended for all levels."
3,good but lacks depth,"after hearing how strong a book 'hyperspace'was,i decided to take a look at Kaku's new book...to my dissapointment,the book was more like a schoolboy's essay on the subject,lacking any depth or analysis (which i didnt find strange..knowing that the co-author has written about 4 COOK books!!) so if you just wanna know the history of superstrings and previous theories..then buy that book,if you are serious about getting to the grips with the subject,Avoid it."
2,Inaccurate,"I read this book before having any knowledge on high-energy physics. I don't remember too much about this book, but Kaku has a habit not not really giving the right explanation, and making bad analogies."
1,I was disappointed,"Numerous occasions of poor writing and some wrong statements of fact combine to disappoint me. Some of the more egregious examples are these. On page 37 we read ""astronomically small"", which is an oxymoron. On page 68 we read ""billions of chemical compounds that were known to exist."" There are only about 20 million known at this time. On page 82 we read ""...literally picking one's self up by one's bootstraps..."" The bootstrap business is a figure of speech, not a literal statement of fact. (It is also a cliché). On page 136 we read ""The vice-like grip of the black hole's gravitational field is so great that nuclei are ripped apart..."" I believe it is the high temperature, not the pressure, that dissociates the nucleons. On page 185 the aliens are said to reply ""We understand what cobalt-60 is. We know which element has sixty protons in its nucleus."" Cobalt still has only 27 protons. It's hard to trust a book that has such obvious mistakes."
3,Good introduction.,"This book is a well explained introduction to recent speculation in the field of astronomy and physics, more particularly superstrings and supersymmetry. Here lays his hope to find a 'Theory of the Universe'.Most of the book tells us the story of 20th century physics (special and general relativity, quantum mechanics).I missed the swinging style of a John Gribbin for instance. For the content, I prefer the books of John Barrow 'Theories of everything', Martin Rees 'Before the beginning' and Brian Green 'The elegant universe'.I must say that the book 'Visions' by the same author is of another calibre."
3,Ok.,I found that some of the discs skip or will not play right. Very disappointing but not all of the discs do this.
2,Color Fades Fast,"My 2 year old still loves the swing but in less than six weeks, it has faded. Underneath is still the original nice red color but any area that you can actually see is now pink."
3,Walk the Talk,"I ordered two pair of these socks because of all the hype about them. I've worn them with walking shoes when I go out for my daily three-mile walk. I like that they don't slip around but they do seem a tad heavy to me and after wearing them for much of a day, I am eager to remove them from my feet.. I will wear them more but am unsure if I would want to order additional pairs."
2,"Cute, but not so useful.","As a general rule, I think buyers should beware of any product that combines more than two functions. This combination camera/video recorder/voice recorder/mp3 player is a prime example. If it did just one of these things well, it might be a useful item. Unfortunately, it takes mediocre pictures and records substandard video due to its cheap optics. It would have been better marketed as a cheap mp3 player that also happens to take pictures. That being said, it's not completely useless- a kid would probably love this thing. If you want a fun gift for a youngling who's only interested in taking silly snapshots and recording fart noises, this would be a decent choice."
4,"Great present, I loved it but...","This was a present from my son, I loved it and played with it the whole day. Takes nice pictures but....It's taking me awhile to get used to the idea of the shape of the camera. I'm not used to it and I'm having a hard time finding the buttons when I have to use it."
1,Poor Poor Quality,"I bought this camera because I liked the idea of a webcam, digital camcorder, and digital camera all in one. The MP3 player was a bonus, but not a needed one for me. The camcorder was such poor quality that if it was dark outside and I tried to use the camcorder in my kitchen with artificial light, the person or object I was filming showed up only as a dark dark blob. It looked as though I had filmed them in the dark with only a dim flashlight on. The webcam never worked, it froze up everytime I tried to use it and I had to take the batteries out to get the camera to turn off and work again. I am hoping that I just got a bad camera and that this thing isn't really for sale like this! Needless to say, I sent the camera back and won't be trying another one."
1,I would never recommend spending money on this,I was very fascinated when I saw all in one features. I was never able to take a good picture. Nothing comes up when you click a picture inside the house. It is better to spend a little more on a good quality proudct than this.
4,Works great for the price,"I am happy with the camera. I have yet to use all of it's features, but have extensively used it for photo shots and videos. The lighting has to be just right to take good photo shots and the videos can only be taken at a certain time of the day..preferably at dusk. All in all I am happy with it. Being a full time student, I spend my bucks on books, not overpriced cameras, and for the price of this one, it is a great deal."
3,DXG USA DXG-305V 5-in-1 Digital Companion Digital Camera (Blue),"This is a cool camera, I enjoy playing around with all the features like the Mp3 player and the voice recorder. But it does take 4 AAA batteries so it is best to buy some rechargables. The still camera takes good 3MP pics but you can't shake the camera at all or the picture will be a bit blurry. The video feature isn't too bad if you keep it on the lowest res. An SD card is a must have cause the 32MB internal memory won't hold that many pics or videos. I suggest buying a 512MB SD card."
3,"Good digital camera, average video camera","If you are going to buy this camera, don't count on it to be great. You should only get it if you already have a good video camera. But it is pretty good for taking still pictures. It does have all the features of a nice camera, but the quality is pretty bad. If you are going to buy this camera for the price, its not worth it; just spend another hundred on a better camera. Also, you have to buy a 512mb memory card just to have a little over an hour of film."
2,THE BAD REVIEWS WERE TOTALLY RIGHT,"i was thinking maybe it was just other peoples point of views that the pictures were bad, dark and fuzzy. they were TOTTALLY right though the camera has the worst lighting EVER u have to have super lighting just to see on the lcd screen and when u finally do see the pictures/videos show up still kind of dark..i was very disapointed in this camera it should not even be called a camera becuase it is soo bad, but the built in mic is good and when u have the headphones that came with the package plugged in the sound quality is very good so i would call this is a mp3 player and nothing else becuase the camera is very bad and seemed like they rushed making it. im the type of person that likes to have a camera for ""the moment"" AND nice ""show"" pictues and this camera is VERY not that becuase it will all show up VERY black or bearly lit, except for the size and mp3 part. I will NEVER buy from DXG again"
5,The Best of the Best,"An excellent collection of the most exciting sports moments of the 20th century, and it's a collection that will get more valuable over time. While Garner's writing style might be described as simplistic by some, it is entirely appropriate for the subject matter at hand - sports. Here you don't want ivory-tower verbosity, you want simple direct descriptions, and Garner delivers.Any sports fan will be captivated by Garners descriptions, and will relive the passion we all experienced with those great events when heroes were still heroes. For the sports fan in your family, there is no better gift."
4,A spellbinding read,"I found that the simplicity of Garner's writing style is an appropriate vehicle for conveying the power of sports' most memorable moments. He strikes a balance between overintellectualizing and patronizing the reader. He continues the spellbinding tradition of ""And the Crowd Goes Wild"" while simultaneously breaking new ground. This book is definitely a great gift idea for the sports fan in your family!"
3,"Not bad, but I've had better","I've tried many, many, many varieties of gluten-free pasta over the course of the last four years, and this one just doesn't stack up. It's very easy to overcook, and quite bland. Having said that, I've found the best way to cook it is to bring water to a boil, empty the pasta into the water, return to a boil, cover the pot and remove it from the heat. Remove the lid after five minutes and stir the contents. Return the lid to its place, and leave it for another 4-5 minutes. Even when cooked this way, it's still far too chewy and starchy.I've had much better luck with Tinkyada, although I'll try whatever's new on the market. Glutino also makes a pasta comparable to Tinkyada, but that costs a bit more."
3,Easy to overcook,"This product works well if you're very careful not to overcook. We thought it was a little bland though, compared to some of the other gluten free pastas out there."
4,Nearly perfect,"This is a fantastic RPG that forces you to be sensible with battles and strategic with rations. The fighting system is good but IMO could be tweaked a bit. I personally find it annoying that I can sneak up on an enemy and shoot him in the back with an arrow only to have him and his allies immediately realize where I shot from. I wish he would remain dazed for a second or two until he actually saw me. The only other reason to knock a star off is the lack of explanation within the game. There are hundreds if not thousands of items to pick up and use. The trouble is, you have no idea what many of them will do. There are rather vague descriptions, i.e. a bottle of wine will cause you more fatigue and detract from your dexterity. Why the heck would I pick that up??In any event, this is a huge game with a huge map. The variety of weapons, armor, shields, magic spells and enemies is excellent. Definitely an enjoyable game despite the slight combat flaws and lack of explanation."
5,The game is great if you have the time,long game. good balance between action and exploration. it can be easy or hard depending on how you play it.
4,best ps3 games so far,"although it renders only at 720p, the visuals in this game are very promising of what's to come on the ps3. not much to say about the game itself as it's been out on pc for awhile now. a great quest based game."
5,Exellent Game will suck up your life.,"This game is so good it is somewhat dangerous. After playing this game for over an hour I saw how much it really has to offer. After getting some of the initial introductions out of the way the game begins to bombard you with things to do and you soon find yourself with no shortage of quests to complete or places to visit. The graphics in this game are awesome, as is the storyline. The controls are a little unorthodox, but shouldn't be too hard to get used to. I highly recommend this game for anyone who even slightly enjoys RPGs or wants to see what the PS3 is really capable of."
2,Gets boring quick,"After a friend advised me to buy this game in addition to reading the reviews here, I picked it up. At first, I though it was pretty cool. The environments were detailed and innovative, the menus were well organized and fairly easy to use. But the combat really sucks. I can't seem to be able to enjoy it. When creatures are sprinting all over the place and you can't keep a monster in front of you to whack or fire a spell at it just isn't fun. I think the characters are ugly, the dialog gets monotonous, and I just don't care for the evolving plot. I'm going to get the Conan game and see if it appeals to me more."
5,Great value for a great game,"I've owned this game a long time, but never wrote a review. I was browsing the available PS3 games and saw that this is currently available for $19.99, which is an unbelievable price for a game with this much depth.Many other reviewers have said it better than I can. This game combines the free-form non-linear gameplay of the GTA series into a classic RPG fantasy world. Tons of quests keep you occupied and engaged for months."
4,Adventure game,This game is the perfect time killing option for lovers of role-playing quest games. Endless adventures and many beasts to slay although at the beginning some of them are quite tough to beat and I found myself getting frustrated often.
5,The Elder ScrollsIV:Oblivion,"I have receaved The Elder scrollsIV:Oblivion on time. It was what I order I like rpg games this one is going take time to get use too.Its differint from the others I played , I like it!"
5,Seriously Fun Game,I was looking for a reasonably priced game that was like the original Zelda (I'm old). This is so much more than that. I found it on Amazon for under $20 and a rating of over 4 stars. Best $20 I've ever spent on a game! My husband and I fight over who's turn it is to play each night.
4,Hard follow-up to Morrowind,"They really should have left the system alone, as the only thing I really appreciated their doing to the structure of Oblivion was facilitating easy Fast Travel. If you can't top a great game everyone loved, just imitate it... This game has all of the ridiculous and prim dialogue of Morrowind with cleaner, more pastel visuals - their only foil being boring, incessant jaunts into ""Oblivion"" (i.e. Hell).Wait, see, this is what I'm talking about! Because the game is in the series and highly reminiscent of Morrowind, you just nit pick. I still played this game for probably OVER 60 hours (at 50 hours I become embarrassed about such things). I thought it was a great game. I never finished the main storyline, but as a sandbox I highly recommend it. It's just not as good as its predecessor, and will always be remembered as a disappointment."
1,no 3rd person view,"i only rated one star because I didn't play it much yet because it is in first person view. I had read on line that you could switch to third person. now I hear that is only after you have beaten the game. grrrrrr. I do intend to try to make myself enjoy first person, but i don't know if that will fly. If I would have known this game was in first person view i never would have bought it."
1,Open GL and Oblivion!,"The ps3 tries to pull off a pc game. Oblivion just doesnt work on the ps3. With the crappy controls and no rummble feature. Now, the 360 can pull it off with the updated dx9 shaders, and rummble. And all the updates already out for the 360 makes the game look just as good as the ps3 version."
4,great game!,"its a great game, just like fallout it has most of the same elements and is fun to play. and because skyrim cant play on ps3, this is your only choice for a game like this"
3,average,"Oblivion is a decent game. There's alot of things to do. But upgrading is slow. I got stuck on level 1. Also, this is a famous game, so I expected more."
5,A++++++++++++++++++,"LOVED it, totally fantastic and definitely a good buy, make a good purchase with this one and you'll be pleased"
5,Good times,"If you were a Dungeons and Dragons nerd then you will love this game. Hours of fun. The only game I play. If you don't like role playing games, you won't like this game. It's nice and involved with tons of depth to the story and characters."
2,Boring Boring Boring,"I'll start off by saying I'm normally a sports gamer, and I don't typically like RPGs (GTA is great, if you would put it in that genre.) But when I bought my PS3, I decided I'd give this game a shot since the reviews were fantastic and it won game of the year.All I can say is, I'm glad I bought it used. I played the game for a couple of days, trying to get myself interested, but I just couldn't. The graphics are pretty average for todays standards (this game came out quite awhile ago) and you spend an awful lot of time as a character in a mostly silent world wandering around hoping that something interesting happens. In short, it's boring. Very disappointed."
1,good for a while but gets glitchy,For the first few months this game performed fine but recently has started to freeze constantly especially when traveling between rooms/sections and has even started freezing when i try to save/load.freakin nubs
3,semi ok,They are very nice but i had to fix one of the earings because one of the strings weren't attached to the right hook but after that it was ok.
5,"A Legend,A True Star ! HOME TO YOU A MUST HAVE !",Hello I am a fan Of Martha Reeves and this new cd is a must have for lovers of Great Music !!!!!!!!!!This is a true music treat for from a True Music Legend !!!!!!!!!!!Shawn
2,Save your money.,This adapter drops the connection under high CPU load (watching a DVD for example).
5,"The Pinis are back in a great, flaring nova!","In a slightly smaller format than the original paperback volumes, the Elfquest tales that occurred between the great espiodes of the elfin adventures on The World of Two Moons are all presented in full, glaring colors that really blinds your eyes which are more accustomed to the gentler tones of the colorized comic-book collections. Here you meet Strongbow and his wolffriend, Kyavek and her winged boyfriend, Ember and her coming-of-age discoveries, Tyleet and her foster kid, and Skywise and his ill-fated parents. Personally, I feel that the gentle little Tyleet had inherited her mother's child-hunger, so she had a chance to fulfill her aching maternal instincts with an abandoned infant from a nearby human camp. Pretty sappy, in my opinion. But all the Elfquest fans get to unlock even more mysteries about their most favorite elfin characters as well as color-saturated new stories to boot!"
5,Wonderful addition to the collection,"This book is a wonderful addition to the Elfquest collection if not only for the utterly wonderful artwork. It is a collection of stories ranging from when Cutter was young to after the palace returned. Some of the stories lack that adventuristic flare that the series had, but the artwork and the fact that it fills in a few questions I had made up for it. Overall I would highly recomend it."
1,Not as advertised,"I bought this as a gift for a young boy.Product description is:""Product Dimensions: 3.3 x 2 x 1.6 inches ; 1.6 ouncesShipping Weight: 1.6 ouncesIt doesn't say anywhere that it is ENCLOSED in a plastic case and those are the dimensions of the CASE not the car. The item costs $4.98 (reasonable), the shipping costs $5.97 (unreasonable), total cost $10.97 I would ""pass"" on this had I known the actual size which is 1:87"""
5,Bringing Students Back with Rhina,"I've taught Rhina's work for the last two years at a small northeastern college, and the students respond to her as to no one else. They understand her work and love it, and when they're not sure, she intrigues them mightily. You cannot go wrong with ""Where Horizons Go."""
4,memories of Zagreb!,"We were introduced to Styrian Pumpkinseed oil in Zagreb, Croatia this year and I was very glad to be able to find it online. It is delicious and supposed to be good for you!"
5,great new author,I am very impressed with Mr. King's work. He really knows how to capture the reader's interest all the way to the end. He has great potential and his book should be required reading in school. I recommend it.
2,Torn Binder,"I ordered and received two of these two inch binders.One Binder was in great condition, the other Binder was fine on the front of the binder, and it works properly.However, the back cover of the binder is torn & broken at the bottom edge. The package arrived in a larger than necessary box, but it was in good shape....no smashes or dents. So this had to be damaged, before it was shipped to me.I have no idea why AMAZON would send me a damaged item.Not Happy."
4,Perfect for playbills,"Perfect for storing playbills, as long as your not perseving them as a collector. The offical playbill site is so expensive, I just wanted a place to store my ""memories"". I actual cut the covers off and put two in (front and back). Works perfect with 3x Avery Heavyweight Sheet Protectors, 5.5 x 8.5 Inches, Pack of 15. I just wish the binder looked more like a photo album (pretty) instead of something from stables. But there really isn't anything out there this size."
1,Just more banal Hip-Hop junk.,"Rap will never have a clever songwriter (re: ""Beep Beep, Who Got Da Keys To Da Jeep,"" is NOT good poetry) who can write pensive, invigorating songs. On top of that, none of these vacuous subhuman scum can even sing; which again, is sadly exhibited here by Eightball and M.I.G. Oh yeah, that drum machine thud is starting to sound REALLY hackneyed."
5,Love it!,"I have all of Ashley Turner's Yoga DVD's. She's great! All the videos are different, with lots of new moves. I love her gentle voice and calm teaching style. My favorite is the Power Yoga DVD. Its a workout, more so than the weight loss DVD I've found. I like having all the DVD's so if I feel stressed I do the Stress Relief DVD and if I want more of a workout I do the Power Yoga DVD, etc."
2,Too Slow,So very slow. I tuned out a few times. Plus she does not explain the poses and when you zone out you don't hear that she moved on to another pose because she did not say she did. Plus her hair piece was distracting me.
1,Not age appropriate,I have done Hatha and stretching yoga for years. This video asks more of the body than someone close to 60 can accompish.
2,Would not recommend,"Not a very good DVD all together. It was rushed with minimal stretching. There was not enough time given to breathing so you were even rushing for your breath and it's suppose to be for stress relief! Don't get it, there are better one's out there."
4,A wonderful stretching and relaxation program,I did the two programs together after work and found both sessions to be terrific for stretching and strengthening long lean muscles and relaxation after a long day at the office. I have myofascial pain syndrone and yet I could do this program easily. I recommend doing both sessions together for a fuller workout.
2,"The sequences are excellent, but Ashley's voice sounds rushed and the music is annoying","This DVD has great potential. Unfortunately, Ashley's voice sounds rushed. The background muzak is grating on the nerves. Overall, this DVD is not the relaxing experience it could be. I found the sequences to be wonderful and effective, physically. The breathing focus was a nice touch. I found the voiceover and music to be too annoying for me to get any psychological stress relief. I'll just have to turn off the sound on the TV. :("
4,Good deal,"Very happy, I received the product on the time expected. I'm not so sure about the material, it doesn't look like steel and is not so heavy. the product is very good, the delivery was fast and I'm satisfied :)"
3,"A pretty good, it seems to me, book","The feel of Land of Dreams is very similar to the very earliest Blaylock novels, Elfin Ship and Disappearing Dwarf. That means great ideas, great (oddball) characters and, of course, Blaylock's incomparable sense of the fantastic and the absurd -- but it also means some seriously clunky writing at times. (JPB might say, ""The writing, it seemed to the reviewer, was, apparantly, somewhat awkward""). It's an enjoyable book, but I can't work up the same unbridled enthusiasm that I have for later Blaylock novels -- Paper Grail, Last Coin, All the Bells on Earth , Night Relics -- wherein his prose skills are sharp enough to deliver on the promise of his wild imagination."
3,Falls Short of Expectations,"What drew my interest in reading this novel was the setting and time period of Cuba in the early 30's. And I was searching Hemingway in fictional settings. This novel has an abundance of characters. None of which really commanded the lead. Not even Hemingway. I did notice that every time a character gained momentum, the author somehow left them stranded, sent them off packing and faded them out. Only to have them reappear again with the same result.I would recommend this book, though I was searching possibly for a different approach and result.The author did put the characters in an about famous and note worthy landmarks and situations of the era which somehow loosely packaged everything together."
5,A must for Hemingway enthusiasts,"You've read all the literature by the man, all the books about the man, and now you've reached the point of reading fictionalized accounts of the man. It's all part of the natural transition of the die-hard Hemingway fan.""Welcome To Havana, Senor Hemingway"" is a well researched novel that entertains and informs, covering a little known period in Hemingway's life. His relationship with Jane Mason, based on fact, is convincingly portrayed, as is the marlin fishing with Joe Russell on the ""Anita"". The flavor and turmoil of 1930's Cuba are effectively brought to life, giving the novel its greatest strength.Estrada is an excellent, descriptive writer."
1,Never recieved the item,"We recieved the other two books but never recieved ""Welcome to Havana, Senor Hemingway"""
2,Cheap but is it worth it?,"I got the printer after it was on sale at a local store. However, after installing it and using it for a week, I realized that the printer was having some power cycles(lasted for few seconds, even during the night when no one is using it) every few hours. I felt troubled and called Lexmark. They told me to connect it to another power source and that did not solve my problem. My conclusion of the matter is you pay for what you get.I decided to return it to the store because the purchase will not be a long term investment. I was not sure how long the printer will work before acting out. I also feared for the noise and causes of power cycles since this is the first product I ever had that did that."
2,Fast but noisy,"Bought the printer from Staples for $149 in 2005. Bought it because of Lexmark's reputation and my previous laser was a Lexmark.It is fast -- greasy fast -- however it sounds like a tank. Initial powerup takes about 30 seconds. Average time to print for text is about 7-10 seconds. Graphics take much, much longer. It seems like Lexmark, to make the printer cheaper, made it dumber. Printing a document with complex graphics (a picture, PDFs, etc.) takes forever -- it seems.A positive is the 250sheet paper tray. However, when the printer runs out, it keeps spinning a paper grab wheel until paper is loaded. The printer looks nice with a black shell and grey top. . The output bin is poorly designed and printing big documents will result in pages that have to be shuffled and aligned.Oh, the initial toner cartridge is only good for about 2000 pages.Overall, I was disappointed and will probably replace the printer within a year -- and not with another Lexmark."
1,Absolute Garbage,"I support computers for a living and I cant see how anyone can say this printer is good for anything but problems. I have had 4 of these now, after buying the original one BRAND NEW, all it did was paper jam. I was sent 3 more REFURBISHED printers by Lexmark (They seem to think I want a refurb. printer), and ALL PAPER JAM. I went down to circuit city the other day and there was one on display--WITH A PAPER JAM. In the end I have a laser printer that doesnt do anything but jam. And I will NEVER buy a Lexmark anything as long as I live."
5,Impressed with the priting speed,I've set up the printer today and the installation was pretty easy. I have a couple of other laser printers and E232 is compatible with other printers in terms of the printing output quality. I got it with a very good promotion price from staples. I was impressed with the printing speed of the printer. It was very fast and has a large paper holding tray which is a convenient feature. I am very satisfied with the printer.
4,An excelent monotone laser printer,"I purchased my Lexmark E232 printer several months ago and I have been very happy with this printer. I used to have Ink jet printers and I was forever having to clean the nozzles of dried ink as I don't use a printer every day. This printer has razor sharp text and not so bad black and white pictures after sitting for a week. I noticed in the reviews of others, complaints about a noise of something running for a split second while the printer sits idle. Well, this noise is actually the paper roller resetting itself so it doesn't end up with a flat spot when not in use. So don't freak out and send it back, because it is supposed to move the roller every so often. You get very nice prints of anything you would want to print in black & white. I recommend the Lexmark E232 laser printer for the person who prints a lot of text, or someone who doesn't print very much like Me."
1,It hurts. It smarts. It burps. It farts.,"After reading this book, I wanted to quit the graphic arts and take up plumbing. Unfortunately, my wife talked me out of it. So I've filed for divorce. Thanks, Hayden."
3,"Reference, not read-through","It was required as a textbook at Rogue Community College (Grants Pass, Oregon) for the Illustrator course. The course was probably more helpful, and we're likely more enamored of the program itself, but the book has a permanent slot on our reference shelf. Not very readable, but packed full of information highlighting the improvements since the previous version of the program. The authors realize the importance of keyboard shortcuts, for which we are grateful."
2,not for me,"I went through almost a full scale when reading this book. When I started, I loved the premise. Writing was very good - this may actually make me pick up some of his other books. But when I got to the middle, the book got into the lengthy ruminations on Esther, and lots of details on... ehem, sucking, licking, and... swallowing. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude, and sex in books does not bother me, buy enough is enough, and I do not need to know all about... well... sucking, etc. As the book veered away from more interesting topics, I simply got stuck. I just did not see the reason to keep going - there was not enough meet on the bone(r)."
2,Cultural Colossus,"Possibility of an IslandMichel Houellebecq set a high conceptual standard with his book, The Elementary Particles, nearly 10 years ago. Without entering the Science Fiction genre, he was able to do what the Best Science Fiction writers have been trying to do for three generations: Out-do Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World."" The Elementary Particles is a philosophical Tour de Force. If you have not read it, do!The power of Houellebecq's vision is amazing. But, this venture into Science Fiction style writing is weak. The Possibility of an Island can not be saved by Houellebecq's profound human insight or social foresight. His sarcastic pop culture allusions read thinly like Salmon Rushdie references. The lack of conceptual grasp of technological context demonstrated in the sections of the book placed in future time are a distraction at best and damning at worst. I chose not finish this book."
3,Cerebral exercise,"I did like the premise of this book. I think my dislike lies with my dislike of the protagonist. Mankind is nearly extinct. It has been reduced to small, savage colonies apparently returned to the more primitive forms of our past. Neohumans have taken the path of cling into increasingly cerebral beings who rarely socialize, eliminate emotion, and maximize organic potential. The horrors of old age have been eliminated. Neohumanity awaits a perfect race. Daniel, our narrator, is cerebral before his transformation. He is unlikable, and feels this to be a virtue. Ultimately, I say skip it."
2,Not up to par,"Having read ""Elementary Particles"" a few years back and loving it, I was excited to tear through Houellebecq's latest forray into misanthropy. However, I found it to be less piercing and clever than (and more than a little derivative of) his breakthrough novel. Even though I generally appreciate Houellebecq's brand of vitriol (and it's not for everyone), I found ""Island"" to be a dim shadow of its predecessor, rehashing too many themes from ""Particles"" while showcasing the author's hang-ups more than his brilliance. Also, the sci-fi aspect of ""Particles"" felt more original than it does in ""Island"", which seems to pull directly from the wikipedia entry on the Raelians. Sadly, the experience of reading this book had deterioriated into a chore by the time I had reached the end."
2,Little Progress,"I was disappointed by this book after really enjoying Platform, Elementary Particles and Whatever. This is a book that may be good to get new readers in to Houellebecq but overall it's not as compelling as his previous works. The construction of the novel is interesting (alternating between the present and future with each chapter) but it also becomes rather tedious after a while."
2,Boring people find boring people,"Sartre he ain't. The book is long winded, obtuse, and dull. The (very occasional) flashes of insight are not worth the slog. Skip it."
4,Solid quality binocular - Nikon Premier 10 X 25,"I bought the Nikon Premier 10 X 25 a while back and have been very impressed with the solid build and great image. I also have a Leica 10 x 25 Trinovid and the two are very comparable in view and image quality. The Nikon takes a little getting used to the position of the focus knob which is toward the front instead of the rear like most other binoculars. I use my middle and next finger to focus. For me although they are reduntant due to also having the Leica, the Nikon is a keeper because of the sharp image and wonderful build quality."
3,Really good football DVD,Really good DVD about Celtics progression towards Seville. Bought this as a present but I watched some too and enjoyed it.
2,Jar and Can opener,Both the jar and can opener work fine but the can opener lever is built to come apart for easy cleaning but comes off too easily when just trying to remove the can from the opener.Good for people with little strength in their arms and hands
4,The Witness of Preaching,This is a good resource for my pulpit ministry class. It is easy to follow for the most part and is very helpful in writing sermons.
4,A very detailed information on coffee,This book is like a encyclopedia of coffee. It have alot more information where other sources doesn't provide.Its a small yet thick book. Tells you everything about coffee.
3,WARNING: It's not a pack of three.,"I just ordered what I thought (judging by the photo) was going to be two sets of three Vovito candles. The very next day they came in and they smell wonderful, but they were not in fact sets of three. It's $23 for 1 candle! So I just bought two candles for $46. Now that I go back and take a closer look, I feel like I should have realized that it was only one candle per order, but in case you got the same impression from the picture that I did, I thought I'd let you know. Other than that, the delivery was very prompt and the candles are very nice... however not worth $23 a piece in my opinion."
5,Smells So Great!!!!!!!!!,"The Red Currant Votivo should break some kid of candle scent world record. It smells like heaven...in fact, it smells a lot like my favorite spirit, Lichido. I have a closet full of the stuff (the candles and the liquor). Thank you, Votivo!!"
5,Great gift item...,"Ordered two of these candles as gifts (Red Current & Moroccan Fig). They come carefully packaged in a nice box, and the candle is in a clear glass voltive. Red Current is a more perfumey scent with an undertone of fruit, while the Fig is sort of sweet-earthy. A good housewarming/hostess gift."
5,Votivo Aromatic Candle - Honeysuckle,"Onen of Votivo's best candles, it has an aroma most close to Honeysuckle and lasts quite a long time. Packaged lovely, the vendor sends it safely and swiftly. You can't go wrong with Votivo and Honeysuckle."
3,a bit disappointed,"I'm a long-time purchaser of Votivo candles. For some reason, this one didn't smell the way I remembered. It burned at an odd angle even thought he wick appeared to be straight and I trimmed it regularly. Probably just an odd one in the bunch."
3,Smell great but give me a headache,"These candles smell wonderful, but if I sit next to one for too long, they give me a headache. I'm giving mine away to friends with stronger brains."
2,Candle didn't have the usual intense scent,"I love these products however, this particular candle does not have the same, intense scent as previous candles I've purchased"
5,Excellent book,This book was an excellently written. I loved the exercises given. They were extremely helpful to beginner and professional poet alike. I recommend this book to everyone. Even non-poets who are looking to expand their creativity.There is enough background information as well given for the form poetry. I found that helpful and informative.There were so many poem exercises that I will be doing them for years to come.
4,Creating Poetry.,This book is more suited for one who has started writng poetry. There are numerous exercises which may discourage the novice.At the same time it covers well all aspects of poetry. On reflection my original judgement may have been somewhat hasty.
4,Not so much about the ultimate theory but what it should be,"This was not quite what I expected it to be, which was an overview of the latest ultimate theories of physics. The book does go into that topic to some extent, but it is as much about the philosophy of science as about science itself: not just the ultimate theories, but what constitutes a successful theory and what characteristics an ultimate theory should have. As such, it addresses such topics as symmetry (especially the broken symmetry believed to explain the four basic forces), compressibility (the capability of a simple theory to explain complex consequences), constants, laws, the anthropic principle, initial conditions, and much more. It's difficult going at times, and I can't pretend that I understood all of it. However, I think it's a book that will bear rereading, which I will plan on doing. Oh, and the quotes at the beginning of each section are great!"
5,Excellent Virtuoso Album,"This album is a beautiful example of virtuosity coupled with good taste and aesthetics. Every song is both pleasant to hear and skillfully played. I cannot give a technical review of Indian/Pakistani music, but I will say that I have been listening to this type of music for some time and this album is definetely up there. If you are into classical North Indian music, this album will not dissapoint you. Get it...."
5,An Amazing Book!,"This book truly embraces the beauty of Islam, and the teachings of Islam, with respect to all the religions. I highly recommend this book to anyone out there who wants to learn more about, or research in depth the truth about this serene and peaceful religion. Happy Reading to all! :)"
3,Good and Bad,"I accidentally ordered two and was very glad I didn't return the other. The first one broke within a minute or less (the picture wouldn't change). My poor 3-yr-old nephew couldn't understand why I would give him a broken toy. I kept getting asked ""why???"". Thankfully, I had a second one that I could give him. I noticed that other reviews were either very positive or very negative. No guarantee if you'll get a good one or not."
1,bob the i cant fix this,"i got this toy for my brother , who is 4. The buttons were hard to press, the stickers didnt stick, it used many batteries, and it makes noise i guess its supposed to talk but all i hear come out if muffly speaking like a bad radio signal. Save ur money! buy something else!"
5,Bob the Builder Cell Phone,"I purchased this phone for my grandson who is 4 and a big Bob the Builder Fan. This is his second one. It didn't break, he just lost it, and was so upset. He could have had anything else, but all he wanted was Bob's cell phone. We finally found it on Amazon, and he was right there with me placing the order, and everyday he would call me to see if the mail man brought his Bob Phone yet. He plays with it constantly, and keeps it in his pocket at all times. Great gift, for all the Bob fans."
2,boring,"i was not impressed by this movie. it started off so well too. a nice action scene where the kibakichi took care of many foes all at once cutting off one mans hand in the process. i started thinking of this as live action anime. only problem was it took so long to progress from this point. i hope i wasn't expecting too much but the story was just boring. half of the movie was just gambling and not even interesting gambling. sorry, but i just didn't like this movie.if only this movie had a large enough budget to support the supposed special effects then this movie might have had a chance. i would rather resort to some anime then watch this again."
4,Entertaining but slow moving at times.,"Kibakichi has everything I like in a movie: monsters, martial arts and explosions. Unfortunately, mixing all these elements together in a movie is tough, and Kibakichi needed a much bigger budget to make them fit inside this action-fantasy film.People looking for a pure slam-bang action film from start to finish will be in for a surprise since this film has quite a few slow spots between all the blood-letting."
2,Just Plain Weird,"Kibakichi is just too weird for me. It's a very long, slow moving flick. The werewolf and constant explosions look straight out of a Power Rangers episode. If your looking for frustrating entertainment and dig the Power Rangers then this one is right up your alley otherwise stay far away."
1,Booker Prize winner? Why?,"Full of stereotypes and one-dimensional characters, it's hard to believe this book won a literary prize."
4,Beautiful scenes,"The scenes are wonderful. The two countries are too marvelous, especially Bruges. It's easy a pitty the flowers are growing only in the spring."
5,A response from the author&#65533;,"I am saddened that one reader felt this way about THE COMPLETE FERTILITY ORGANIZER. I wrote this book to assist a woman in gaining a sense of control over her fertility, by providing information about fertility, infertility diagnosis and treatment, references, and a centralized location in which she may keep all of her own medical information. There are also sections which assist a woman to explore the emotional/spiritual side of the (often very stressful) infertility process. The book is designed to accommodate all degrees of infertility; it also has a section to track essential information when a woman does become pregnant. Please read my letter to readers (in editorial section above) so you will know exactly what this book contains; and I truly hope you'll find my book, with its comprehensive information and organizational tools, a good value. I have heard reports from many women who have found this book a valuable resource, and hope that others do, too."
3,1968 Firebird 400 Convertible,Not the most detailed book.(Get Fabulous Firebird for that)But for some good color pictures and brief explainationsits fine.A little short on first generation.
3,The author should have focused more on the interesting parts of his life,"I thought this memoir only average, and quite self-indulgent. Fully half of the book is about the author's genealogy and his life before the war began. He devoted a chapter to each of his relatives. This section should have been cut by two-thirds. Things got more exciting when he finally started talking about the Nazi invasion, but I wish he would have written more about his feelings during that time and how he was able to survive when so many died. Meh."
2,Growing up in Riga,This is a very wordy description of one Jewish family and its various branches. The first 80 pages could have been done in 30. After the first part it becomes an interesting description of one person's view of survival. Good book if you are studying the Holocaust.
4,Remove cord between Bob and Scoop,The directions on the box I had clearly stated to remove the cord before operating -- maybe they got a clue! Still having problems getting Scoop to follow Bob though.
4,[...] Really?,"I just bought this toy at a consignment store for [...]. It doesn't have the wire thing, but from the previous reviews it isn't necessary to have, you can still enjoy it. My son is running and screaming for joy playing with his new toy."
4,"Intially disappointed, now happy","We purchased this for Christmas and it did not work. I emailed the company and even though we did not have the package, etc, they replaced it and our 3 yo son loves it. He is a devoted Bob fan, so he liked it even when it did not work, but I am impressed the company replaced their item and helped him have a scoop that works!"
2,"Cute, but disappointing...","Although my son was excited to get this item and played with it right out of the box, it seems to be too hard for him to figure out, and I had some trouble myself. I was really disappointed in this item after all of the publicity it recieved. I don't think we have got follow me mode to work at all, and have had limited luck with the other mode. We have had the most luck getting Scoop to spin in circles to the Bob the Builder theme. Needless to say, this toy is now sitting back under the Christmas tree and not being played with. Maybe when we have more time to figure it out...but this item was geared towards younger toddlers, and I don't think it should be this hard to use."
1,A poorly designed toy,"We originally got this toy for my 4-year old son for Christmas but ended up returning it to the store. While the toy is supposed to work in carpet we found it acted sluggish and did not respond well. One of the wheels did not spin as fast as the other, resulting in the toy slowly spinning in circles, even when it was supposed to be going forward. The follow me mode didn't work, and the scoops didn't lift and move the way they're supposed to--the movement was choppy and sporadic. While the concept it good I am not willing to keep a toy that does not work properly right out of the box, and so we exchanged it for something more useful and dependable."
1,Doesn't Work!!,"I bought this toy because it says it will follow you. It does not! I even bought a second one and it didn't work either. And yes, I am sure I was using it properly. I even called the manufacturer and they just said to return it. So I did!"
2,firearm disarm,"he's gonna get someone killed! the guy has never been in any street confrontationsfrom what I see, no street knowledge!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not as good and could be..,"Queen Bee Of Mimosa Branch is the story of Lin Breedlove Scott, a recenty divorced woman who high tails it back to her hometown after 30 years to re-group and get on with her life after her husband leaves her for a stripper and in trouble with the IRS. While back home in Mimosa Branch, Georgia, she gets involved with a politcal campaign to remove the current Mayor and replace him with a local preacher. Lin also takes up with Grant, a man that she does not particularly like but uses to get back into the dating pool again.My favorite parts of the book happen to have been about Lins off the wall family.. her mother Miss Mamie, her father the General, her Uncle Bedford, and her Aunt Gloria.Queen Bee of Mimosa Branch started off light and funny but took a quick nose dive with uninteresting story lines and charactors."
3,Less Social Commentary Please,"I'm a fan of Haywood Smith, but I was unfortunately recently disappointed with this book. While I find her a skilled, engaging, and humorous writer, I was disappointed by the social agenda being continuously pushed through this book as well as the bitter-toward-all-men feel of the story and unnecessarily high level of profanity. Maybe it makes me a cheap audience, but I just want to be entertained when I'm reading fiction, not feel overwhelmed with social and political statements. I've enjoyed some of Ms. Smith's other books a lot more than this one, and I'd recommend reading Ladies of the Lake to someone interested in reading this author."
3,Queen Bee of Mimosa Branch,"Good novel and very funny in spots, but the ending was a little sketchy. It wasn't what I thought the over-all tone of the book would lead to. Maybe if the conclusion would have been explained just a little more in depth it would have been better. I would recommend this enjoyable read to anyone who likes tales about Southern women. My book club really liked it."
3,"Get this from the library, then decide if you want to buy it","To me, this book didn't ever quite come together. The book had lovable characters and small town charm, but the plot to me seemed very disjointed, and some of the relationships between characters seemed contrived. When I got to the end of the novel, I wasn't quite sure whether or not I actually enjoyed the story or not. I'm not sure what the point was, to be perfectly honest."
2,If you hate men...,"I would recommend this book if you hate men and want to jump on the feminist band wagon. The novel started out great and was very humerous and entertaining. About midway through though, I realized that every male in the book was drastically flawed and I thought, unrealistic. Maybe I was reading this from the wrong angle, but honestly, there are a few good men out there."
3,Great Beach Book,This is a great beach read or rainy day read. You can really get into these lady's lives and lose yourself for an afternoon.
3,Almost Good,"Loved the repartee. Good dialogue, and a subject and lead character that far too many women can identify with. Total disappointment at the end. The whole book led us to lust after Grant -- what over-50-year-old woman wouldn't love to have a front porch conversation with him? Or to be the one who is constantly on his mind or, for that matter, seduced with all the care and attention he lavished. Who was the real ""jerk"" at that point? Obviously the author has some unresolved man-issues that she used this book to expurge. After all was said and read, I totally disliked thebitter Queen Bee."
2,Never came together,"I liked this book in a few spots, but I didn't think it ever came together and told much of a coherent story. The characters seemed very stereotypical and one-dimensional. I especially didn't get the end, with the drama with Lin's best friend squeezed into literally the last few paragraphs. Made no sense at all except to underscore how selfish and self-absorbed Lin was. To the readers who have said, ""Maybe you have to be from the south to 'get' the south"", I think that remark does a great disservice to all of the fantastic southern writers out there. This has nothing to do with geography, it's just a badly-written book. And to the reader who compared this book favorably with ""Welcome To The World, Baby Girl"" - seriously, you have GOT to quit eating those brownies your hippie friends bring you!"
3,I agree middle of the line.,"This wasn't a bad book, per say. It was an easy read but didn't seem to have much of a point other than man bashing and her friendship with Tricia. I am glad for the people of Mimosa Branch though. This book isn't her best, but still enjoyable!"
3,Boring...very boring...,"I love southern fiction and I was so excited about this one BUT while funny in the first few pages, don't be fooled. This story is lacking in PLOT and it never really grabbed me. I had to force myself to finish it!The main character, Lin, is not very likeable and is bitter towards all men because her husband left her. She gets in a weird relationship with her boss, Grant, and things just never pan out for her but it does take a postitive turn towards the end of the book.Overall, a boring story but I finished it ~ yeah! I see there are some glowing reviews here for this book - go figure."
2,"A little TOO quaint for my tastes, ya'll...","I'm typically a fan of Southern fiction, but this was just too down-homey to be believed. Lin Breedlove returns to her small town roots and her life, once a shambles, is magically transformed by her fellow Mimosa Branchians, all of whom are just the gosh-darnedest sweetest li'l folks on the face of the earth. I swan, you just cain't believe how wonderful everything turns out for this menopausal matron.I skipped many a passage in this book to come to the rather bland end. Shallow and irritating characters with just the right sprinklin' of political correctness to make sure no one is offended. Overall, a rather silly, vacuous read that probably isn't worth your time."
4,Lots of fun,"This is a fun book. I loved the main character and her wacky family. I loved that it was about an middle-aged (or a little over) woman and thought it really protrayed the way, we are never grown up when we're around our family. I was a little bothered by the inconsistencies in Grant - the love interest but otherwise found this a perfect, light read."
1,Thoroughly unlikable characters,"A divorced fiftyish woman moves back into her parents' house to rebuild her life, but (with reason) dreads coping with her loony family.Yet another book featuring characters you would run in the other direction if you met on the street. Why do authors think these people are any more tolerable in a book? I didn't get very far into the book before quitting, the characters were just too awful to take any more. Yes, there are certainly people like this in real life, but I don't enjoy spending time with them and I'm not going to waste my valuable reading time on them."
2,Had the good sense to quit reading,"I only picked up this book because of the endorsements by Sandra Dallas and Trigiani. Somewhere around page 80 I realized it just wasn't going to get any better, and I decided to cut my losses and quit reading. I won't bother to reiterate what the one and two star reviewers wrote, except that I echo their sentiments. There are too many good books out there to waste my time with a silly yawn."
2,Racist,"Well, I must say that I am far from a fifty year old Southern Belle. Maybe you need to be from Georgia to truly enjoy this book. I went with it. I finished it. Even found some parts funny. However, I cannot help to think that Haywood Smith is quite racist. She keeps being nostalgic about the way her old Georgia used to be. It is no longer the same she says as she describes all the different cultures that she observes. Don't get me wrong. She does not come out and say it. If you read the book, you will know what I am talking about. It is hard to explain. Read this quote from the book ""An Oriental couple--Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese? I could never tell--hovered close to the register...A young black couple with a runny-nosed baby argued in some kind of an indecipherable rap jargon..."" Wow! I really think that she is going for strictly White Southern Belle middle-age woman as her audience. I am quite surprised she has continued to publish to be honest."
3,Good thing it's not hyped as a romantic novel,"The book probably deserved four stars because it was an okay, even at times an entertaining read, and the female and family relationships were interesting, but the main character's relationship with her ""romantic"" counterpart was totally unbelievable, and I found that very irritating. I mean, let's get real. No one, whether in real life or in a novel, should have to live up to perfection. If a guy is honest and upfront and generally decent but wants to get laid without promising happily ever after, that makes him a jerk? And a fifty year woman acting as skittish as an adolescent virgin? Please."
2,"Bad, boring Southern fiction","I loved the title and the cover, but that was it. The book was full of stereotypes, cliches, and totally predictable (although unbelievable) characters and story lines."
5,Expertly written,One of the best books ever written about air combat. You feel like you're one of the Jolly Rogers yourself !!
4,Recommended,A well-written account of a famous Navy fighter squadron and the under-appreciated F4U Corsair. Highly recommended.
5,UAU ! TOP OF THE LINE !,"It is simple: this is one of the greatest WW II fighter combat books ever written ! THe narrative, even when is not dealing with air combat, is compreensive and important to the history. The technical details about the Corsair are commented without being boring or difficult to understand. THe pilots are ever present and their subsequent fate after the War ere mentioned briefly. Great. It's a shame Blackburn died soon after the book was published."
3,For absolute beginners only,"The title of this course is very misleading. It is far from ""complete"". The author simply plays each interval, one kind at a time, in different places on the guitar and you find them. It does not have anything about relating a note to a key center/note, or anything about chords (type & function). I recommend Ear Training from Hal Leonard for a more complete course."
4,Lessons for on the road,"I recently finished a ten lesson special at the local extension school, Beginning Guitar. I have other books and a nice DVD but Complete Guitar By Ear fills a nice gap for me. Ripped to my MP3 player I can go through the exercises pretty much anywhere I happen to be at the time. Also, since I have a poor ear I do thing the repetitive listening help more than reading from a book."
2,Had high hopes...,I was disappointed in this ear training product. For an absolute beginner we need to know the correct string/fret used. After the first example he doesn't tell us what fret/string he played. It wasn't explained well. I would put it aside for a few months and try again once I'd learned a little more guitar but I didn't trust my ears and didn't want to continue on--if I had gotten it wrong it would take a lot longer later to relearn it correctly. I wish there was a booklet or website to go along with this product--I really wanted it to be what I needed. My search continues...
2,Learning By Ear - Not That Easy,"The advert is better than the product. Having bought two guitar tutorials on the same day along with a number of other pieces of material, in comparison, this was not one of the better purchases."
5,Great Train Book,"This book follows a toy train through a day of hard work in a little boy's bedroom. It's written as a poem and flows easily when you read it out loud. My toddler loves pointing all the various items out to me that are the fantastic illustrations: dogs, cats, fish, princess, bear, engineer."
5,Chugga Chugga,"Our boy already loved Tugga-Tugga Tugboat and My Truck is Stuck, so I had an idea that he would like this book by the same author/illustrator combo, especially because he likes trains.Well, this was his favorite of the three. The drawings are charming, the story sufficiently uncomplicated for a nearly-three-year-old, and he wanted us to read nothing else for weeks. Highly recommended."
5,A great train book!,My son loves this book. He is 18 months old and had shown an interest in trains. I did some research on amazon and kept coming back to this book. It was a great choice.
5,Our favorite book ever!,We Love this book. I have 2 boys - 4 and 2. We were given a copy of the board book when the oldest was a baby. We read it so often that we wore it out and I had to buy a new copy. We went with the hardback this time since the boys are getting older. I'm hoping they won't destroy it too fast. I actually like this copy better. The book is larger and the pictures are beautiful (not in a gorgeous Polar Express kind of way but in a cute kind of way).I've read it so many times I can quote the whole book :) This is a great book for any child but especially for those who love trains.
2,Surprised by all the 5-star reviews,"I don't usually post reviews, but thought I should for folks who rely on these reviews in picking books. All of the 5-star reviews motivated my decision to buy this book, but after reading this book to my kids, I can't believe it got so many 5-star reviews. The rhymes in the book are insipid, and the artwork is just so-so. My train-loving, book-loving 2-year old was not engaged at all, and this book is frankly a chore to read. If you are someone who seeks books that are as enjoyable to read as they are for the kids to listen to, this is not your book. There are books like Smash Mash Crash, Little Blue Truck, Jamberry that I never get tired of reading. Then there are those books that are frankly a little boring to read but that my kids have both loved hearing over and over anyway. This book falls into neither category."
2,Confused about all the 5-star ratings,"Sorry, but this just isn't a very attention-grabbing book, and my toddler LOVES good books. He looked at this once, gave it back to me, and said ""no."". I tried reading it to him, and it was a chore for me to try to get through it.Don't waste your time or money - there are much better books out there. Try ""Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site"", ""Trashy Town"", or just about anything other than this one.Oh - and for those of you who don't like creepy clown illustrations - DEFINITELY avoid this book."
1,Just okay book.,"I really like books that sound good when you read them and have some sort of story. The only part that sounds good is the title. This one doesn't have any kind of story. Just trains. So, if you're child likes trains I would think they would really like this book. But, it's not that fun of a book to read. Just pretty good train pictures."
5,Colorful with lots to look at!,"My son, two, loves trains. We love to read this book together as the words are very simple and short (keeping the attention span of a 2 year old). Also, there are wonderful illustrations on each page with lots of different toys to look at. He loves pointing and naming different things on the pages."
5,My 1-yr son loves this story,My son received this book as a gift for his birthday. The moment he saw this book he fell in love. He is always bringing the book to me so I can read it to him. Plus he will pick it up himself and look at the pictures.
5,Must Read (Again and again and again),"We got this book purely by accident and our 14 month old son LOVES it. He repeatedly asks for it to be read to him. He has worn out the first paperback version, so now we need to go buy a hardback in hopes that it will survive.He hasn't read the words yet, but I'm sure he will.Great book with very vivid illustrations.Who needs Harry Potter, we've got Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo."
5,Great all-time fave,"Both of my children have loved this book. They are 2 and 4, and we read this one a lot. I highly recommend this book, as well asvothers by Kevin Lewis. Really great colors and illustrations, fun flow to the words. Love it."
5,One of Our Favorites,"I just ordered our second copy of this book, as my son loved the first copy to death. I bought it for him a year ago for Christmas, and has been one of our favorites ever since. At 18 months, my son could pour over this book for hours, asking me to name each object in the pictures.The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, and the rhyme is very lively. Just don't leave young child alone in a room with it!If you have a child who loves trains and trucks, I highly recommend this book!"
4,sing a cute book,I love this book and just maybe a little more then my son.. I think if you sing as your read you'll both enjoy it a little more.
5,Great Children's book,All of my children have loved this book. The pictures are great and the story line keeps them interested. This is one of my 2 year old's favorite books. I had to get a second copy because the first one was worn out.
5,Take your train to bed with you!,"The little boy in this story loves trains, and when it's time for bed he chugs his wooden train all around a most elaborate track...under the tunnels under the chairs in the bedroom, around some blocks that might cause a landslide, on a bridge across the river (a fish tank) and onto bed with the tired little boy who settles in with some stuffed animals for the night. It's a soothing and inventive bedtime story, and a pleasure to read aloud."
1,Debunks redlining,"Before buying this slim volume, know that its purpose is to debunk redlining, using data from 1976. The information from the northern cities they present may be true, but do not expect this to be a definitive work on redlining."
5,Gluten Free Orgran Macaroni,"This is an excellant product. Cooks up very well, great with any sauces,mac'n cheese, and also makes a fantastic macaroni salad. The price from Amazon was really a bargain as all gluten free foods are so very, very expensive. I just wish we didn't have to buy so many packages as storage becomes a problem."
5,Children in War,"Over 2 million children have been killed in wars over the pastten years. ""Children In War"" covers four different warzones: Bosnia, Rwanda, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia. The authors interview children of these war zones, letting the children tell their stories in their own words. The authors also include the childrens' artwork to help punctuate their stories. The book is a devastating indictment of the brutality of war and how it sacrifices the innocent and helpless on the altar of ideology."
4,Pentax K10D,"When I first received the camera I was impressed, but then I found out there were some problems with the firmware. There had been two updates to fix bugs found. My camera came with none of the updates which means I purhased a brand new camera that was defective when I bought it. The worst part is that I found out by accident on the internet searching for an accessory for the camera. I bought a new camera camera that was defective when I bought it and was not told. I don't know whether to blame Cameta Camera or Pentax. Other than that I guess the camera is O.K. The green buttons on the camera and on the grip are a little dinky and the menu button has to be pushed a little hard to make it engage."
2,Surprise Disappointment,This book has very little of the enchantment and spark I have come to expect from Mary Oliver. Most of the poems seem off balance and dry. I wish her all the best and hope she recovers from her grief.
5,Poetry for the soul,Mary Oliver does not disappoint. Over the years I find that I go back to her poems over and over again.
2,Deist drift,"`Nature poetry' at its best is matching words and rhythms with life's infinite diversity of sounds and sights. It is a physical struggle of wit and often humour; it is raw, jarring, and at times red in tooth and claw. Mary Oliver has been a master of it - see her encounters with owls.There is inherent danger with `nature poetry'. When words fail the poet he may be tempted to replace her curiosity with wonder, astonishment, and eventually mushy spirituality, or even mystic unity. As such poetry moves from long argument to disembodied deist sentiment it loses dimensions - it becomes kitsch (as Kundera would opine).Mary Oliver's Thirst is the record of such deist drift and the result is disappointing. She does not have the frenzy mysticism of a Rumi. She does not affirm her unconditional love of God like St. Francis Hers is consolative - hence instrumental - poetry in a minor key."
2,Disappointing,Mary Oliver is one of my favorite poets. Everthing I have read of hers before this book was just great. This book was very disappointing and is not at the level of her past work.
5,If only,"Other reviewers have spoken well of Mary Oliver's grief at the death of her partner and her search for God. I want to mention a poem that spoke to me and said ""If only."". If only our leaders would read this poem, be touched by it to move in other directions.Mozart,for ExampleAll the quick notesMozart didn't have time to usebefore he entered the cloud-boatare falling now from the beaksof the finchesthat have gathered from the joyous summerinto the hard winterand, like Mozart, they speak of nothingbut light and delight,though it is true, the heavy blades of the worldare still pounding underneath.And this is what you can do too, maybe,if you live simply and with a lyrical heartin the cumbered neighborhoods or even,as Mozart sometimes managed to, in a palace,offering tune after tune after tune,making some hard-hearted princeprudent and kind, just by being happy."
5,Touching,"I read lots of different material and am rarely touched as deeply as I have been while reading Mary Oliver's ""Thirst."" Her poems have moved me to prayer; for myself, my loved ones, this beautiful world and for the poet herself. Thank you."
5,Profound and Touching,"I have long admired the works of Mary Oliver. Her clarity comes from some deep, mystical spring that feeds her spirit and in turn allows her to feed ours, as well.A joyful read."
4,Tin sign,I ordered this as a gift for my uncle and he loved it! I thought it was very neat. My only complaint was that one of the corners was bent just a tad when it arrived. But it wasn't bad. I would recommend this for the baseball fan in your life!!!
5,this girl rocks,jade is from Austrlaia and over here she hasn't done too well in the music industry i cannot see why not. she has stunning vocals and a talet that i wish everyone could hear. i havent heard this album but i have been impressed by the first 3 singles released. so do a good thing a buy this album she is a remarkable young Aussie talent.
4,excellent product!,"I have long, straight hair. I am not really big on using hair products, but I use just a half- dime size of this stuff. I love it because it is light (it is like i didnt add anything extra to my hair), leaves my hair very silky soft, helps control some of that extra static, and smells great! :)The bottle lasts a pretty long time- I have had mine for over a year now and it a small size."
4,"Good bag, good price","This bags works really well for the pool or the beach. Handy zippered pocket and ID holder with clear panel works great for going to the YMCA. Size is good for an adult/teen. It's a little big for a small child. Holds a lot of stuff...life vest, kickboard, bubble along with a towel, swinsuit, coverup and sunscreen. Seems very sturdy, like it will hold up. Only minor drawback is the top opening. It's a drawstring closure and when you don't have much in the bag, it doesn't close tight enough. Still would definitely recommend this bag."
4,Big Bag,"I swim 4-5 days a week. I wanted something to carry my swim gloves, fins, goggles, ear plugs, swimming cap, and water bottle from the locker room to the pool (and a bag that I could keep these things in without having to worry about taking them out and drying them). This bag works well for those purposes, but it is a very big bag -- bigger than a standard backpack. This is probably good for someone who snorkles but is really more room than a recreational swimmer needs."
3,Good bag.. but defective,This bag is of good quality if you got one with a good closure system. my bag could not close properly as the string was pulling on one side only.
5,Fancy in Red!,"I use this Speedo Deluxe Mesh Equipment Bag to transport my Speedo Kickboard and my Aquatic Exercise Dumbells to and from my Water Aerobics Class. I love, love, love it because of its beautiful, vibrant red color and its light weight. mesh fabric. My wet exercise equipment dries quickly and easily in this mesh bag and so far it is very durable. I received a compliment on this bag from a adult male at the swimming pool. He said that he liked that it was in back pack style (He said it was cool). I love it because it does EXACTLY what I need it to do! Will puirchase another one if I have to. My recommendation is to Run, don't hesitate, get this equipment bag!"
4,nice bag,"this bag is good for a swimmer at the gym, however I only wish it had more inside pockets, it has one, however it is a perfect size and easy to throw on your back and go, also light weight"
4,Simple and effective,This bag keeps pool gear together and allows for quick drying. The mesh material has held up well to pool chemicals and being tossed around in my trunk.
4,Big Bag,"This bag is huge, it can fit my mask, snorkle, booties and fins but the fins stick out the top. Without the fins and booties I could fit my giant beach bag, a camera, and lunch/drinks along with the mask and snorkle."
2,bag won't close properly,"The drawstring does not close the bag tightly, even with tremendous effort. As a result, even large items can fall out if the bag is not kept upright."
3,Missing zippered side pocket you get with the other Speedo equip bags,"I bought this bag in black and neon green also. The pink one, although it is the SAME price as the black and green ones does NOT have a zippered side compartment. It would be one thing if this bag was slightly cheaper, but I had the joy of paying the same price for the inconvenience of a missing side pocket. Nice quality bag otherwise."
1,Black - MADE INCORRECTLY!!!,"I've ordered the black bag, then exchanged it for a second bag since the first was defective. The second bag was also defective. The draw string is stitched into the tube, making it impossible to cinch the bag closed. So sad! This is an extremely well made bag!!!! If only the draw string was not sewed down (you can tell this was an error)!It appears all of amazon.com's stock of this bag (in black) is affected.REALLY wanted this bag. Bummed!"
4,Great bag for your snorkeling gear + wet clothes,"This is a perfect bag to stow and carry your snorkeling gear + wet clothes. However don't recommend it for your scuba gear as I am only using it to stow my short fins, mask, snorkel, towel, clothes, etc. I would have given the bag a 5 star if it had one or two zipped pockets to keep my phone, wallet, keys, etc."
3,"Color ""Silver"" is light greenish gray","... and the edges of the strings are rough. Otherwise good, but a bit too long for a normal wear but too short for the rolled yoga mat."
3,EH.....,"The trench is okay, but hey, you're in a trench for almost the whole film. Kiss is just an early film. DC's much more hip and forceful as an actor now than he was then. Better selection if you like DC is Layer Cake."
5,Great intro to Technical Analysis,"I've read over 100 books on trading, and have to say, this is the best intro to technical analysis I've seen. You can start without any knowledge of technical analysis, and be competent to plan your own trades by the end of this easy-read.Let me put it this way, when my mother expressed an interest in learning more about investing, I bought this book for her."
4,It did the job!!,"I am no car buff. I know that. But I do know a little this and that and when my 1995 Mazda Millenia S sounded like crap after my brother gave it back to me I knew it was the exhaust. Wasn't looking forward to having to pay up for service on that so I checked it out and it was just the muffler and it was rusted half away and only up to the bracket it bolted to. Looked it up on amazon and lo and behold it was here, and only $150. Well that's not so bad so I ordered it up with my Amazon Prime Account and received it with FREE TWO-DAY SHIPPING. Awesome. Had to saw-zaw the old rusted bolts off but this one bolted right on with no problem. Exactly a direct-fit that had some nice chrome looking tips welded on it. It wasn't black like the picture though. Started the car up and it was smooth and quietness again! Hooray, my first muffler job!! Perfect fit muffler and it sounded right on. I recommend if this is the muffler you need. I've had good experience from my Walker Exhaust."
2,"A nice, quick little read, but..","not what I expected, and not close to the ""'can't put this down"" level of Good Bounces. Sorry Ben, you disappounted me."
5,Fantastic music from Hawaii,"Joanie Komatsu writes great love songs set in Hawaii. I don't think she sings much any more; however, on the two albums she recorded, she sings beautifully. If you can find this, buy it!"
3,Great book but..Plaugurisim?,"Ok I love Amelia's books as much as the next person, and two days ago I happened to get both Midnight Predator out and L.J.Smiths The Chosen.IT was then I noticed the simalarities between the two. The main characters: Turquoise (Midnight Preator) is a human HUNTING VAMPIRES. Just like Rashel (The chosen) both have trained since they were young, beacuse when both Turquoise and Rashel were little they witness they're Mom and little bother mudered by a vampire. AND Rashels little borther is 5 and called TIMMY, while Turquoise is 5 and called TOMMY.Also both sneak into a Vampires Lair type thing, pretending to be captured slaves, to kill vampires.They're just too alike to be mere coincidence. AND since Amelia admits to reading L.J.Smiths books, and The chosen was written first..well, you figure it out."
3,"Good, but there's one problem.","I'll admit that I didn't buy this book; I read it in a bookstore when I had a few hours to kill. And frankly, I'm glad I didn't spend money on it, however much Amelia improved. Don't get me wrong, I like her writing style and I think she has potential to get up to Anne Rice's level when she grows older, but there were a few things about this book that bothered me. First off, she really needed to work on the setting better. Like others said, it didn't sound very much like a slave house. She should have made the conditions bad so we could believe it to be a slave house. And secondly, the cover? That kinda turned me off, because you would imagine Turquoise to look like a girl and not like...a man. Sorry, but the cover wasn't that great and the person didn't fit anybody in the book. Other than that, she has shown improvement and I admire her for trying hard. But she really needs to work on setting. It's important. Same thing goes for character development. ..."
4,Mixed Feelings,"With this being the fourth book she has written, Amelia Atwater Rhodes has certainly made a name for herself in the world. I have throughly enjoyed her first three books, as well as the fourth. The story has an excellent plot with incredible detail, but the ending seemed to be lacking. Never the less, I would highly recommend this book to both reluctant and avid readers, as well as readers who have already took pleasure in Rhodes' work."
4,Abusive Vampires Beware!,"Turquoise is a member of Crimson which is part of Bruja. For the past two years she has been a mercenary hunter. Her prey has been vampires. She and a rival have just been hired to infiltrate a vampire slavery den known as Midnight.Turquoise was once a slave to a vampire. It has scarred her physically and mentally. Now she must put herself under a vampire's control in order to carry out her contract.Once inside Midnight, Turquoise learns that not all vampires as a evil as those she has dealt with in the past. They are still predators, but the come in varying degrees.The ordeal Turquoise goes through reads like a rape or abuse survivor. Unlike many in real life, Turquoise gets a chance to take revenge on her abuser.This is a very strong tale that deals with some harsh issues (don't let the vampire trappings fool you). This is a story of dealing with abuse and humiliation. This was quite well done."
3,A Little Too Anticlimatic.,"I liked the book ""Midnight Predator"". Tourquise is a humman vampire hunter. She willing goes undercover into Midnight to take down a really evil vampire.The book was good and the plot was good, I just think that Atwater-Rhodes could have made a bit more dramatic, either emotionally or phisicly, ending. It ended kinda blah...not a great desciption, but it's the only thing that seams to fit. If you want a good book by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes I sugest all her other books."
4,"Good, But not the Best","I'm a big fan of Ms. Atwater-Rhodes, and I've read all of her books and loved them, but when a read this one I was given a disappointment. ""Midnight Predator""'s plot was skimpy, and without much of an ending. Although the plot may have been a disappointment, the characters were not. They were just as realalistic as Ms. Atwater's past books. Each with their own diverse history. All-in-all this book was good but certainly not the best."
4,An excellent read,"I picked this up at my local bookstore, and after reading my required reading for world civ, I picked it up. It was 11 PM and I should have been in bed (I could have put the book down right then and there) but then I read the first page. I couldn't put it down till 2 AM! The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it follows a very similar pattern to all her other books, which is a bit boring. However, the characters were very multidimensional and the plot was very interesting. I would recommend this to anyone."
4,midnight preadator,"I've read all these books to this set,and I have to say it was my fav. You never know whats going to happen to the characters. This is true about the others, but this one gets me."
3,"A good book overall, but with flaws.","Ameila Atwater-Rhodes is a talented writer and i am a fan of hers. However, I have some issues with her work. First of all, she always has a romantic relationship slapped into the story that is never really explored. I realize that her books are ment for a preteen to teen audience but still the relationships seem underdeveloped. Also, in Midnight Predator the 'bad character' is Jeshikah. In Demon in My View the main character was Jessica. You would think that the author could pick a different name for one of them. Anyway, the biggest problem I have with this novel in particular is the ending. I HATE endings that leave you hanging. It always seems like the strings are left untied. When I finish a novel I like for there to be closure so you know how it ends. It always annoys me when authors pull that stunt."
2,Another Clone...,"Sadly, this book disappointed me. It really did, why does she overuse the same characters. It's really the reason not many serious critics give her credit, hell, they don't even bother to look at her books.The thing that bugged me about it was the assassin thing. Does Amelia even know what a an assassin does? They don't play dress up and go undercover like a reporter or cop. What was with the whip? Whips do barely any good use.As for the storyline, there wasn't one. She never came out with the objective. She never does and that's what [ticking] off a lot of people who don't appreciate her work. They are also getting sick and tired of the callous and lonely lead female. For once Amelia could come up with something original.It's sad and despressing. All her books have the same endings with no actual conclusion. Need I say more?"
3,I was disappointed!,"Reading her first three books always left me waiting for the next to come out. I loved Demon in my View, Aubrey is one of my favorite characters. But after reading Midnight Predator, I find that I'm not anxious to get my hands on the next one, unless it surpasses the story line of Midnight Predator. The author, though very talented for her age, needs new ideas. Something past her previous cookie-cutter books. Hopefully the next will be as original as the first."
2,Okay,"It was a good story and well written but I was disappointed because I wanted to read more about Aubrey and Jessica and Risika and Fala and Caryn and all of the old characters. But it was a really good book, I was just wanting to read about the old characters. It wasn't what I was expecting... I don't know... It was okay I guess. It took me awhile to finish it though. But if you're a fan you might as well read it."
2,A Good Beginning,"So much more could have been done with this book. Ms. Rhodes is a very good author but I believe her character development skills leave a lot to be desired. It seems to me as if the end of this book was quite rushed. The reader is left wondering ""and then what?"" There really isn't any closure. Besides this the main point of the book was to kill ONE vampire and we never even find out if she dies. All that is said is that their plan to kill her might work and it might not. This book could have been so much more."
3,At least she changed a few things...,"I have to admit, I'm getting a little tired of the tough-girls-who-fall-in-love-with-hot-vampires storyline. At least in this book, the main character *didn't* get turned into a vampire. But come on - Jessica and Aubrey, Sarah and Christopher, Turquoise and Jaguar - I think we deserve a different story. I'm all for teenagers getting published, being a teen writer myself, but it needs to be something special. In The Forests of the Night was special. That was worth publishing, and - I think - worth the hype. Demon In My View? Everyone could tell it was Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' fantasy about her characters coming to life. Shattered Mirror? An attempt to vary the storyline that failed miserably. Midnight Predator? Another attempt to vary the storyline that could have used a lot more editing before it was published.So go ahead, read this book - from the library."
5,Midnight Predator,"this book I have enjoyed the most out of her books. It kept you wanting more. Atwater-Rhodes is a very good writer, and she's a young novelist. I recommend everyone to read this book, and also the other books she has written."
5,*Midnight Predator*,"I think this is the best book that Amelia Atwater-Rhodes wrote so far.About a girl named Turquoise Draka, and her rival, Ravyn Aniketos, who are on a mission to destroy Jeshickah, the original ruler of Midnight. Midnight is a vampire realm, and the only way to get in is by selling themselves in as human slaves. Helped by several companions; they manage to get into Midnight, but Turquoise's main obstacle is someone that she would of never thought would befriend her.I won't tell anymore, but you should defiantly read this, even if you're not the vampire/witch kind of reader..."
1,Same old thing,"One thing I am confused by, why is it every vampire she creates is a big macho and no one knows about it being the most rivaled vampire in the world?I admit she has only tough girl wannabes who aren't as strong as they appear or act out to be which is annoying.Though her writing has progressed I wasn't interested in reading after the first chapter. The ending was confusing and we don't find out if she kills the villain. That's the whole point of this book.Apparently she has over 200 characters created, little advice stick to a couple. Having so many characters causes plot holes and you tend to forget that much."
4,Good book and a good series,I liked the entire set of 'vampire' books in this series. Quick reads and interesting characters as the stories overlap.
2,Vapid,"When I was in my early 20s I read a book called 'The Third Wave' by Alvin Toffler. It completely changed my life. It made clear the things I felt happening in the world and explained them in a way I still carry with me today. I became a Toffler devotee and read everyone of his 1000+ page books. Then in 1995 he wrote a small 200 word book with Newt Gingrich about the future of politics. It was the worse piece of crap I had ever read. It made no sense. It's ideas were vapid and muddled. Someone recently said that Newt is ""a stupid guys idea of what a smart person sounds like."" I completely agree. Knowledge without ethics, empathy or vision does not make you smart. It makes you dangerous."
3,if you're too busy to read THE THIRD WAVE....,"...then this might be an option, because it's just a rework and condensation of its predecessor. It also sports an intro written by Newt Gingrich; I have no idea why unless he was selected to provide an unintentional but effective example of outdated Second Wave power politics."
2,Loved them but quickly disappointed,"I loved these shoes until about 2 months after I bought them. Sadly, the elastic that holds the button on broke and no shoe repair shop could fix it permanently. I had to have both shoes fixed numerous times until I finally gave up. I really wanted to be able to wear these for years and I didn't make it through 8 months. So sad that I had to get rid of them :0("
1,Poor Fit,"If you like for your heel to slip out and to flop with every step, buy these!I love Dansko, but this one was a poor purchase. I love the design of the wide based sole--great for a stablized step, but there's a defect in the upper build. Too bad because now I can only use them for a paper weight:("
5,this guy must be done...ill stop him in one,fantastic video...beeing a boxer myself i admire his fighting style.
1,Broke in 4 months!,This product is nice to shake polish bottles though it only lasted four months before just dying! It works well though extremely loud.. sounds like a jackhammer while on.
1,dead in 3 weeks,"This product worked great as long as it worked, sadly the material used to assemble it is probably pretty cheap. After less than a month of using it 3 to 5 minutes here and there to shake some vallejo paints the saddle that you set your paints on completely broke off. A cheap product so I guess we get what we paid for."
3,For gel polish,"I got this to shake my gel polishes, but it seems weak. It shakes them very little. Although it sounds loud and appears like it is really shaking well, it doesn't seem to on the bigger bottles like the opi gel, or gellish. I still have to shake the polishes by hand after I leave them in the shaker for 30 mins. This is also the 2nd one i've bought. The first one only lasted aa couple of months, of course no refunds. Already the plastic band has broken on the second one, as well as it did on the first one I got. I had to use a thick rubber band in its place. It's cheaply made but there is no competition out there for this product, so as a nail tech, it's not like we have a choice. It's better than nothing."
5,Good Product.,This is just what i was looking for. I use ink for tattoos. They settle over time. This brings them back to life fast.
1,"Horrible product, even worse customer service","I purchased this item hoping it would work as advertised. Problem is it bounces all over the place when you turn it on. It will not stay in one place. Also, the problem is if this thing vibrates off the table, hits the floor, and paint goes everywhere. I tried to contact customer service and their response was, ""Hold on to it!"" Would not recommend this product or any of Robart's products if that is the type of customer service they provide."
1,shawdy shaker,"I recently purchased and recieved this sorry excuse for a paint shaker! It's very cheaply made the, motor that runs the shaking mechanism is weak and it only shakes ONE (1) jar of paint at a time I have 30 jars that need to be shaken at any given time. So its not faster then doing the shaking by hand unless you only have one jar to shake period!!I think I can invent a better product, heck a blind man could,I call it the ""SHAWDY SHAKER"" bad product,bad,bad,product!"
5,Great Paint Shaker,The Hobart Paint Shaker is wonderful. I use it to shake my nail polish bottles for work. I am a Nail Tech. Would recommend it to anyone.
5,"Helpful, easy to understand, informative",This books goes a step beyond the standard EFT information available on the internet and gives ideas on how you can tailor the tapping techniques for a variety of issues. Her many examples drawn from her therapy practice were very helpful.
3,Accurate,The book shows you the tapping procedure but could be reduced to a 20 page book. The procedure is helpful but is over-hyped as a cure-all. Still it is good to have to go along with other natural helps.
2,Travis gets his foot stuck in a bear trap.,"And that's the thick of the action for somewhere around 10 chapters, I don't know, I lost count. I thought about quitting this book something like 4 times in the past week I've been reading it. Once Travis gets his foot stuck in that bear trap, the action sort of just disappears. He studies for his GED. Woohoo. What fun. OH, OH, OH! And learns his family history. OH BOY. I ended up just skipping all the parts where one of the characters wanders off into his mind about pretending to be some ancestor of his. I sucked it up, finished the 50 pages I had left, and glady returned it to the library. Avoid this."
3,Uneven,"Ron Rash epitomizes the new southern writer, one writing about a south still showing the scars of the War Between the States from a deeper perspective. This novel is grounded in its portrayal of characters rooted in specific time and place, written without irony, old fashioned story telling, but uneven in its pacing. There were sections that took my breath away, and others that I had to struggle with to keep going."
5,Artist review and comments.,"Na Moku 'Eha - The Four Islands was the title song my father David Ka'ano'i taught to me as a boy and was inspired to use as the theme of songs that would represent the four major island of Hawai'i: Hawai'i Nui (Big Island of Hawai'i), Maui, O'ahu and Kaua'i.The back of the album has the illustration of the album song title, i.e. a saying, flower and mountain for each of the four islands. It also included instrumental sound tracks that was used for a Hawaiian Educational TV series viewed throughout the Islands of Hawai'i. A few of the tracks has since been used in various Hawaiian documentaries.Mahalo - Pat Ka'ano'i, Kavika Records, Lvhalau@aol.com"
2,Not that good,"I have read about three quarters of this book and my biggest problem with it is that the testimonials by the boys seem really contrived, as if their words have been doctored up or forged. He has interviews with twelve year olds that flow so beautifully and articulately that it actually comes off as very inorganic and makes you wonder whether or not these kids' words have been doctored up. The vocabulary these kids use is often too sophisticated sounding for their age."
1,Don't bother,"There have been a dozen or more ""boy's books"" lately, most notably the exceptional Raising Cain, by Kindlon and Thompson. Most of them are not worth the bother, and this compendium is at the top of that list."
4,IT CAN'T BE OVER!!!!,I started reading the Saddle Club when I was in third grade and then when Pine Hollow came up I started reading it...I love the series and it was a good book but if it's the end of the series I won't believe it! I mean what kind of ending is that? I want to know what happens to Carole Stevie and Lisa....and i have another question what ever happened to Kate from the Saddle Club????? I mean she was an member of the Saddle CLub where did she go??????????????????????? I wish that Ms. Bryant would answer the reader's questions!
4,Tying Up Loose Ends,"This book tied up most of the loose ends, and that makes me think that it is the last in the series, but there are so many more things that I want to know about, so I don't want it to end. Like Ben and Carole were just getting together, same for Lisa and Scott. Also, what about the new boarder, Kelsey and Jinx the pony, and Maureen and her bad habits?? I want to see Callie and Scooby get competetive, and Stevie was just getting into event riding. This book was awesome. It was a great book, the only downfall is that it might be the last one. Instead of feeling like this was the end, this book gave me so many more things to think about and so many more ideas of what happens nexy. I HAVE to know. I am so afraid this is the end of the series. I hope not, because there are so many more things that I NEED to hear about. Please keep the series going!"
2,"Good Book, dissapointing ending","Great book, but it shouldn't of ended there. It seems clear that Bonnie Bryant isn't writing another book because of how long it's been since this one came out. So, what, the ending of this promising series is that the barn burns down and everyone's upset??? It doesn't seem like the best way to end a series. I'm sorry Ms. Bryant, but I have to rate this a 2."
3,Poor Conclusion,"I found this book really well written and really nice to read. The ending was disturbing though. It doesn't seem like the end to a series! It left so many unanswered questions...How did it start?(you'll know if you read the book, I don't wanna spoil it) Why did they introduce a new character in the last book? I have so many questions that only another book could answer..."
4,Wonderful Overview,"This book covers everything! It has chapters on the history of theater, the terminology of theater, acting, lighting, scenic design and painting, makeup, costumes, directing, and practically everything else. It's clear and easy to read and doesn't talk down to students. There are suggested exercises at the end of each chapter, but I've never used them. The reason I'm not giving 'Everything About Theater!' five stars is that, since it is an overview of everything, it doesn't go in to depth. Of course, it takes a lifetime to fully learn many things about theater. This book is a wonderful introduction!"
4,great book,this was an easy read. it was a touching story about a boy growing up trying to deal with his family and his sexuality. i read this book in two days.i didn't want to put it down.
5,Coming of age,"This is the coming of age story of 14 year old Louis, who has feeling's for a tough guy that stay in his neighborhood. At one point in the novel Louis is sent to a mental hospital because his mom thinks he's crazy, but he's just a confused young man."
3,This Book Was Interesting But...............................,"I can not say if I would have read this book if it was not a selection from one of the members in my book club ""Busara Nayo"" from PA/NJ. I felt this was a good book overall but I have to agree with Edward Aycock from New Jersey regarding the highs/lows. I needed just a little more spirit in the out of home experiences. The issues at home kept me intrigued for the most part. I look forward to reading more from Mr. Wright. I would read his next book because I feel he will work out the kinks!"
4,A Coming of Age Story That Puzzled,"Of all the books we've read in quite a while for our book club, ""Sunday You Learn How To Box"" generated the widest range of critical rankings amonst the members - and lots of discussion. Everyone felt the author through his descriptive writing took you THERE with the characters. Everyone absolutely enjoyed the book until the end, which was too subtle for all except one member to appreciate. As a matter of fact, once it was explained, the rating went up a point for most people. We definitely applaud Mr. Wright's efforts and will look forward to his next offerings."
5,An Excellent First Novel,"I want to thank my neighbor who gave me this book after she had read it and said to me: ""You'll love it."" I did love it. After I read it, I found myself repeating Louis Bowman's name in my head--there's definitely a ring to his name. Wright captures wonderfully the coming of age of Louis Bowman through his descriptions of Louis's family life and life within the projects, as well as Harlem. It's a dynamic world that Louis live in and Wright captures every nuance of it perfectly. The novel was a treat to read, and hopefully we'll see more novels to come from Bil Wright."
1,"Move along, no sorcery here.",I'm a big fan of Dungeon Siege (I and II). So I was willing to give the film a try. Watched the entire 90 minutes hoping that it would catch fire. Not even the dragon could bring it to the ignition point. The only thing positive that can be said is that it cost me nothing to watch because I got it from the public library just down the street from me. Spend your entertainment dollars elsewhere.
2,This movies make the first one look better now,"I never did finish In the name of the King...but now after being tortured by thismovie, i think i will give the first one another chance...at leat it had fighting and lots of cgi effects. \In the name of the King 2, you dont get much ...you get Dolph...brought to the pastbut is unable to change his clothes through the whole movie...you get actors/actresses speaking like they did in the past...but the way it came out inthis movie is not they way they probably expected it. There is lots of talking,yapping but barely any fights or big scenes. The King's part is not very wellacted...(they surely did'nt pick the right actor).What saves this movie from being a total embarassement is at least there wasa dragon that came in the movie near the end and saved me from falling into thatdeep sleep pattern.Dolph Lundgren.....he's a good action character...but for a main character..hummm"
2,Not Worth It,"This movie is not that good and really wasn't even worth the Amazon rental fee. Some are giving it decent reviews because the movie was made with a small budget, but even with that the acting was crap. For Dolph this had to just be a paycheck and it was obvious as he was nearly sleepwalking through the entire movie. I find it amusing how he starts the movie instructing martial arts, but never really does anything related to martial arts in the fights the rest of the movie. Most of the rest of the acting by the supporting cast was stilted as if they were reading their lines off a paper while they were shooting the scenes. This was just a poor movie with a few interesting scenes that made it not totally suck. Lame acting, lame editing, and lame story equal a boring movie."
3,Enjoyably Bad,"After the hilariously and hideously bad first film, this second episode actually doesn't look so bad. Okay, it's still not good, but it's campy, enjoyable fun anyway. Dolph Lundgren is pretty wooden and looking old too, but he's likable and has fun with his silly role. And Natassia Malthe is pretty darn fine. Oh,and there's a dragon! Campy, low-budget fun."
2,disappointing,"Nikki Baker's plots are interesting and plausible but it is a great shame that her main character is such a disappointment. Virginia Kelly is selfish, egotistical, vain and casually cruel - its good to have realistic characters along with their faults but frankly this one is so unpleasant its hard to see why anyone would like her."
2,Low-quality recording,"They show you a lot of basic forms, but the instructors don't seem that into it, and the recording is super low budget and low quality."
5,Great instruction,This is a great dvd but as it says it is for the more advanced practitioner for it does show the more complicated techniches for the kempo karate system this dvd includes Katas pinans demos of the techniches 10 point blocks statue of the crane and combinations for diffrent levels really recommend it especially for the price u have nothing to lose
2,Large and heavy,"The watch is really heavy. I am not a petite woman, but still the watch looks waaay too big on my arm. It looks like a man's watch. It would be okay otherwise, but I never wear mine. It's just too big a heavy."
4,Art is true art!,"Great album for the now gen. Haven't heard music like this. newly recorded, in years. Very good vocalization by the oldtimer! Recommend highly."
2,sort of ok,"Another album of old great songs by another old man. When 70 year olds like Garfunkel Stewart and Macca start singing the old stuff, they have to realise it's all been done before by better singers who recorded when they were much younger. Art has always had a sweet voice, but with these old songs a little subtlety is required, and his one note voice lacks all passion."
2,Pretty Bland,"Just not the ""voice"" anymore. Good standards with only a standard preformance.Altogether pedestrian. Order ""Angel Clare"" His voice sparkles.Hit a few off notes on this one as he sang."
4,Fresh & New of the old stuff...,"The velvety voice of Garfunkel blends in extraordinary melodies of some time ago... with heart-warmth voice tunes, he comes to reach you in a nice romantic evening in which you wish you were having the best grilled lobster with candlelights and the sound of waves crashing near you... just to get you in the mood of something so romantic... that will bump in your mood as you continue listening to this touching songs... Enjoy! And cheers to You Mr. Garfunkel, what a nice treat!"
4,Garfunkels Back,"Art Garfunkel is back with a new cd of standards. Every artist of a certain age is doing this music now, but Garfunkels approach to these songs is different. I knew most all of these songs, but with his voice and the arrangements it was almost like hearing them for the first time. That's a good thing. I loved this cd. His voice being so familiar from his own classic hits, he gives these songs a mellow ""pop"" feel. The only thing that could have made this cd better? His early backup singer Leah Kunkel!! They should do a duet cd."
3,"Good info, but outdated","I second the previous reviewer's comment that this book badly needs a second edition. A lot has happened in coffee in the last five years alone, and this book was written more than 15 years ago. It still serves well as a general introduction to coffee, but the information on coffee and espresso preparation should be considered unreliable. Consider instead: Scott Rao's The Professional Barista's Handbook."
4,"Cute toy, will last through the years.","I bought this for my son for his first birthday. He loves the bucket. He puts everything he can find in it. He's not to into the tools yet, but he will be in the future. He loves to watch me fix things around the house, so I'm sure he'll be following me around in no time with this tool set. I like the soft tool idea, now when he hits himself or others I'm not worried about him/them getting hurt. I would highly recommend getting this for your little ones. It's not a toy I'm worried about him growing out of in 6 months, and I know any other children that play with it wil love it too."
2,soft tool set,"The tool set is cute, but it is almost all the same color, and the actual tools make no noise, not a rattle or a crinkle in the bunch. My son is still too little to do more than look at the set, hopefully he will enjoy it."
2,Duplication of other Cartoon Crazy Porky DVDs,"Caution, this DVD duplicates many cartoons from other Cartoon Craze Porky Pig DVDs."
5,Brio is the best!,If your going to get your kid one of these wooden train sets get a BRIO ! all those others are just knock off garbage brio simply is the best
5,Perfect - Except for batteries,"Great starter set. However, for a 2 year old I would recommend buying a second train without batteries - it will help them to play with the set better. Overall a great buy."
4,Best mistake ever,"I intended to purchase a cart with a flat top to set my tool box on at work.I made a mistake and ordered the wrong cart with the tray top.I was going to return it and reorder the correct cart, but after some out of the box thinking, I came up with the idea of making a plywood top that I could slide on and off when needed for the top of the cart.Works perfectly and is the perfect height to access my tools at a moments notice."
1,Gina Gershon had to ownsomeone money!,"Gina Gershon is one of the best actresses around now and usually makes really good choices of movies. This one wasn't a good choice. The acting, other than Gina, is horrid - although this isn't one of Gina's shining moments. The writing is so much worse than the acting - a 12 year old could have come up with better lines. The end teases a twist but then takes it away and just ends. There are a few too many loose ends that I would have liked to have seen tied up but we all can't have everything. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movieor a good thriller don't pick this one."
2,Just OK,"Just saw this again. The acting is decent, and Gershon is always nice to look at. But the film as a whole falls flat. It's a good premise, but the screenplay doesn't open up enough. You're never really sure who did what or triggered what, and when you supposedly find out ""everything,"" it just ends, with a lot of loose ends left untied. Shame because this could've been a far better picture. The talent was there; it just wasn't utilized."
3,Worth Seeing If You Are A Michael Biehn Fan,"I saw this movie once and even though Gina Gershon did ok, I thought Michael Biehn was the better actor. He is 52 years old now (he was born on July 31, 1956 in Anniston, Alabama). I agree with the person who wrote about Gina Gershon's pout. I saw her in the movie ""Showgirls"" with Elizabeth Berkley and I think she did better in that movie than in any other movie I've seen her in. Michael Biehn plays a cop in Borderline and his character is Gina's character's ""lover"" (at least thats what it looked like to me when I saw this movie on TV. I gave Borderline 3 stars only because Michael Biehn is in this movie. As soon as I can afford to get it, I'm going to buy this movie to add to my already growing collection of Michael Biehn movies (I'm rebuilding my collection because my original MB collection was stolen a few years ago)."
1,Overpriced,I installed in my corvette. The first redtop lasted under 3 years. Replaced under warranty. Replacement also lasted under 3 years. This battery is way overrated and over priced. I replace it at less than 1/2 the cost with a battery with more power and the same warranty. I would not recommend this battery.
4,Does It Matter Whether or Not Its True?,"I've read all of Timothy Good's books;for that matter I've met the guy-he's one of the nicest people on the planet.I have enjoyed all of his books because he's a good writer and because his stories are interesting.Whether or not they're true is something I'm not able to address.Where do you draw the line on stories like these? Other reviewers have shaken their heads over Good's championing of Adamski and other ""contactees"", but their stories, as related by Good,make for pleasurable reading. I personally don't believe that Adamski was being contacted by anyone,but his story was interesting.That's the bottom line.I recommend this book as the best of Good's work and I urge the reader to suspend disbelief and to simply enjoy the book.Pretend that you're reading science fiction if you can't swallow the stories. Most of the subject matter will be new to even a fairly well read student of UFOs and Good's writing style is a pleasure to read. What else matters?"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading ""Alien Base"", expecting Timothy Good's usual level of excellence and good sense. Instead, ""Alien Base"" devotes a deplorable amount of time rehashing the old contactee cases, George Adamski, among others. That Good has choosen to consider those patently ludicrous ""space brother"" fabrications as credible, at least in part, has definitely made me question his judgment.The photgraphic plates were disappointing too, except two shots of aliens, one of which appears to be a dessicated grey.I take the subject matter seriously, but Good's latest book is too uneven, too lacking in analysis, and, at times, presents too much evidence of the author's gulliblity to make for a satisfying addition to the UFO shelf."
1,More of the Same,"Timothy Good's ""Alien Base"" is a bore, with repeated information from other books, and little more than ""stories."" His best defense of these stories is ""Why would these people lie?""I have read his other books and enjoy them, but this one was highly disappointing.I got the sense that ""Alien Base"" merely told people's stories, while citing very, very little evidence. This book is ""more of the same."" Don't buy it."
2,Misleading title & disappointing read,"I was very disappointed with this book. Perhaps it was because I hoped Kirstie would discuss her Jenny Craig experience more, give some insight into her personal struggle and provide tips for struggling with significant weight loss based on her experiences. Instead, she jumped from topic to topic, focused more on her drug addiction history and sex life and barely skimmed the surface of the weight issue. Although her wonderful wit was apparent throughout, the book was poorly written and difficult to follow. If you're looking only for Kirstie's unique type of humor, you may really enjoy it. However, if you're more interested in finding some self-help tips or empathy for the struggles of the obese, forget it because you won't find anything in this one."
2,I expected SO much more,"I have always loved and admired Kirstie in everything I have ever seen her in. I expected a thoroughly honest and entertaining book and feel like I got neither.The diary entries that start the chapters are mildly amusing, and generally have zero to do with what the chapters are about.The references to Scientology are really quite annoying and frequent and seeing how 4 years after she has written the book and nothing has changed for her; makes it also quite laughable.I honestly wish I never would have bought and read this as I doubt I will ever find her as witty as the characters she had portrayed."
4,As advertised,"The book is short and sweet, It is more a compilation of her take on funny stories that happened throughout her life than it is an actual weight loss book. Thus I feel the title is somewhat misleading."
2,Misled,"I was very disappointed in this little book. The title leads one to believe that it will be a journey through Kirstie's public battle with weight.Although there were small excerpts from her journal at the beginning of each chapter regarding her weight and various issues of her daily life, the stories that followed were UNRELATED, but rather snapshots of her early childhood, or some random story about her early life in Hollywood.Kirstie's caustic and ascerbic wit are in tact and although some of the passages were funny, it's not what I thought I was buying.The old adage.....""never judge a book by it's cover"" would have come in handy here.Huge disappointment."
3,"Dirty, But Yet Entertaining","This is a very easy to read book. It is no novel that one needs to concentrate on too much. I am normally a prude, but I found this book entertaining in spite of Kirtie's crude references to her sex life. She swears a lot, but alas, I can't seem to stop myself from doing that from time to time, so who am I to criticize?It essentially reads like she read her journal and picked out the parts she wanted to write about. It's sort of like Fat Actress, but I am assuming the book is based on fact. She mixes in funny stories with some serious stuff, like her drug addiction and anxiety and panic attacks. It's quite the mish mash, but it works for Kirstie."
3,Good effort but could have been better,"I am a huge fan of Kirstie Alley- she is an extremely talented performer who has time and again succeeded. Who else could turn extreme weight gain into an asset? Most of the book is well written and her anecdotes teach great lessons while providing humor. But some chapters seemed forced - as if she had to produce a certain number of chapters so she just threw a few things in to fill it out. Overall, its a good, quick read."
3,"Damn, Mr. Matheson!","I've never flown on a plane, but I think this would be a perfect book to read on one. By the time you've reached your destination, you'd already have read half the book. On the flight back you'd finish the second half, that is if you could wait that long.I read this book in two days, extremely easy to read and very entertaining.There were quite a few times, while reading, that I flipped to the first couple pages of the book to see if Ms. Alley had really written this all by herself. It appears she has. I'm impressed.I definitely reccomend How to Lose Your Ass and Regain Your Life. It made me laugh, it made me think and it was just...fun!I really hope Kirstie writes another book. She obviously is a very talented writer."
3,Wanted more,"I identify with Kirstie Alley. I love her unconventional approach to life and the way she handled the less than perfect circumstances she sometimes found herself in. Her sense of humor is keen.I bought the book because I thought there would be a more specific plan that she used to get control of her eating and lose the weight she had gained. This wasn't there. The only thing she really said about it was that she got there because of her own actions, and she just decided one day to lose it and get back into life. End of story."
1,HOW TO LOSE 20 BUCKS AND 2 HOURS,THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ- WAS ALWAYS A KIRSTIE FAN ......UNTIL NOW! AND I'M ABSOLUTELY AMAZED SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN GET PRINTED! TOTALLY WORTHLESS DIATRIBE- BE VERY RELUCTANT TO HEAR THESE RELUCTANT CONFESSIONS! BOO HISS !!!!!
3,"Funny, but over the top!","The book was funny, but in my opinion, she uses too much foul language when it is not necessary. She does give encouragement from the point of if she can do it, so can you. But the foul mouth got old before I finished the book. I hope she wasn't writing the book just for monetary gain instead of being totally sincere wanting to help people achieve their goals."
1,Did She Let her Children Read This?,"Hands down, this is the worst book I've ever read. I have always admired the author, but was thunderstruck both by the (sleazy) details of her sex life and the language. I cringe for her poor children once they're old enough to be humiliated that their mother actually let this get into print. And were the humping dogs really necessary? Beyond that, there was no diet advice to be found anywhere - except for some vague discussion about Scientology (also yuck). The airline diatribe was mystifying as well. Yes, you were fat. We get it. How did you get unfat? Who knows? I guess I might have expected something this gross from Paris Hilton or some other 20-something, but it is just unbelievable coming from a 55 year old woman. Looks like John Travolta got away just in the nick of time."
5,Even a cynic like me loves it,"I'm a pretty cynical (but content) person in general and tend to pooh-pooh the ""how to be happy"" genre of books probably because of my gritty, punk rock past, but, darned if The Goddess of Happiness didn't help me get through a really heart-wrenching breakup. I'm forever grateful. Now, whenever I need a little lift, I simply open the book to any page and read a little bit. I haven't lost my edginess, but my heart's a little softer. Go figure."
1,2 brain cells or less required,"This book is trite, full of cliches, and has nothing new to offer an intelligent reader. If you seek inspiration in your daily life, check out ""Living a Beautiful Life"" by Alexandra Stoddard."
5,A good read,"What a delightful read. I can feel this goddess connecting from within. I love the way the book is written, with short insightful narratives all tied together into a gentle push toward happiness."
5,What to do . . .,This book is very easy to read. It is very comprehensive. It is very informative. It is objective. It is my constant companion lately. My son's therapist admitted that I know much more about OCD than she does and is now reading the book.
2,There are better products out there--skip this one.,"It's expensive and made no discernible difference to me in terms of energy level or fat burning. I bought these pills to see if they could give me that little bit of extra edge in terms of energy level (which alone translates into a higher metabolic rate, or at the very least, a more intense workout or boost in thermogenesis).My expectations for this product were not unrealistic: I don't sit around popping diet pills, hoping they'll shed fat in my sleep. I walk several miles a week (about all I can do with arthritis!) and do toning exercises with light weights. I am an appropriate weight for my height and not fat by any standard.But these pills simply don't deliver as well as, say, Hydroxycut, Cell-Tech, Stacker 2 XPLC, chromium picolinate, either alone or in some combination thereof."
1,"Works Short Term, But is Not Sustainable","I tried these tablets and in conjunction with a heavy consumption of water and exercise, my appetite was suppressed and I lost a bit of weight (approximately 20 lbs). However, after about a month of taking them, I got sick of the taste and stopped. I continued the water intake and continued to lose the weight.I removed A (TrimSpa) and continued B and C (water/exercise) which leads me to believe that the increased water and exercise really cause the weight loss and not the Trimspa.Maybe I lost the weight due to a ""Placebo Effect"", but I think it would be best if I stuck to tried and true methods of weight loss. This was just a means to start the weight loss process and in no means should be considered a way to make the pounds magically disappear."
3,Not so bad..,Not so bad. But I prefer the original formula. Maybe I just not used to the new version. Still way better than other weight loss products.
5,The best,"Anyone who likes great guitar playing will love this video. I have another DVD by Tommy, but this is ""the best,"" and exactly what I was looking for when I bought the album and the CD. I rate the DVD higher than the CD because it's really hard to appreciate how good Tommy is unless you see what he is doing. He is a very 'visual' performer who puts is all into every song. One of the highlights is when he segues into a sensual ""Waltzing Matilda"" from the finger virtuosity of ""The Tall Fidler."" The percussion rhythm work on ""Mombassa,"" and, ""Nine Pound Hammer"" demonstrate that this musician is a lot more than just another guitar player. The song writing is stunning as well making this simply, ""The Best."""
5,Wonderful Artist,"Tommy Emmanuel is one of the best artists I have ever seen play a guitar. I tried to see him in concert, but he was sold out. This DVD is the next best thing. Turn around the surround sound, turn down the lights and experience the magic."
3,Why,Why does all are series show up in region two and not in us and their stuff show up so slow over hereIve been waiting for this series plus second season of Hex /jeff wayne war/valentina I mean six millon dollar man/bionic woman caqme out in bbc 3/4 year before US got them.
2,"Great premise, disappointing content","I read this book, excited to hear someone talking about how pyschology can be used to study more than just dysfunction. However, as other reviewers have poited out, the author repeats himself unecessarily throughout the book. He also uses anecdotal evidence almost exclusively--which means most of his conclusions or platitudes with little impact.The book Authentic Happines by Martin Seligman is a much better place to turn if you're interested in positive psychology."
5,This Book Really Makes You Think,"I heard the author on the radio and bought the book. What makes this book unique is its attempt to dispute all of these ""facts"" about psychology and health in general. Alot of what is taken as fact by the health community is actually in dispute. If I had to sum up what I learned it would be: 1.Disease and evil exist for a reason in the world and these problems can be used for our benefit. 2. Our reaction to what happens to us is what determines happiness not how much we have compared to others. 3. Having the personality of a thriver will give you health benefits far in excess of traditional measures such as lowering your cholesterol or going to the gym. This book will really open your eyes and its filled with unforgettable stories."
1,"NOT BAD, BUT....","A book full of cliches, with little original insight into the composer. Of course, it seems the author's intention really is not to study the composer's life. The way he renders Beethoven's personal dynamic is bested by three other authors: first, Maynard Solomons' classic BEETHOVEN; then J.W.N. Sullivan's great BEETHOVEN'S SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT; and more recently Carter J. Gregory's historico-fiction, MY ANGEL LEONORA. These are more inspired, but Pearsall is still worth it.Todd Hermance"
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a terrible, unreadable book. I'm not surprised it had problems getting published. It reads like a manuscript that was submitted that needed heavy editing and the author refused. There are long incoherent sentences and the author repeats himself over and over. At some point he starts criticizing the food pyramid and mentions in a very sinister way that it was developed by a senate committee overseen by Senator George McGovern. Huh? And PS: Beethoven wasn't happy."
2,Smile and have happy thoughts,"I expected a lot more profundity about this topic. There are much better works out there than this. The book is evidence that one cannot assume that because a writer has many books published that hey keep getting better, ofthen the revers as here where the audience in mind is simple people who find worn out bromides helpful. Try angel dust insted."
4,Bikini Bloodbath Deja Vu,"Bikini Bloodbath reminded of those ridiculous comedies from when I was young like Kentucky Fried Movie, Airplane, or another lower budget Leslie Nielsen flick.It's absurd; a uniquely quirky genre flick that's definitely worth the watch. There's a Flashdance sequence that's pretty amazing and it seems like the writers put in enough movie references that everyone will get at least a few."
4,soft pillow,"The pillow is a nice size, it comes full of schredded memory foam too much for my taste but lucky for us it came in a zipper pillow case so you can remove some the shredded memory foam material to make it smaller and softer. After the adjustments made it works like a charm, great purchase."
1,Memory foam pillow,This pillow was much too firm. It has no give. I wish I had returned it. I would never buy another memory foam product online without testing it's comfort first.
5,Great BIG sink! And beautiful!,"As all of the above reviews raved. Two things of note: The cutout hole dims could not be found here but the drop-in hole dims from the template are: 32 1/2"" widest (31 5/8"" at narrowest) x 21"" (front/back). The undermount template shows 30.8748"""" (widest) x 16.875 (front/back), w/ 5/8"" radii corners. (This is for the single bowl 511-652.) Also, note that contrary to what the instructions say that come with the sink, apparently you should not use Blancclean on the anthracite sink. Instead, Barkeepers Friend and a Scothbrite are recommended. This is according to a posting/review of the Blancclean product here. Finally, If you're swapping out a stainless steel sink for the Blanco, you'll love how quite the garbage disposer becomes after the install."
5,New kitchen sink,"Great quality, easy to install. This sink is large enough for just about anything, including a baby's plastic tub! Only down fall maybe that it could be a bit more slanted from the far side of the drain."
2,Have a backup plan,"I read an old review about the crack issue, and sure enough I'm in the same boat. My sink arrived, I unpacked it, looked it over, but didn't notice the hairline crack running across the rim and part way into the bowl. But my installer did see it (thankfully), and my scheduled install came to a full stop. My old sink and all connections were already removed and could not be reinstalled. Now we are trying to cope with just a distant laundry sink. A replacement should arrive in two days and we can only hope this one is OK. This crack was hard to see but would definitely be a problem once it traveled further down the bowl. I hesitated to reorder, but I do like the sink and its characteristics, though I wonder if there is an engineering issue with Silgranit 2. The box was undamaged and packaging was excellent. It does not appear to be a mishandle problem."
5,Excellent sink!!,"This is beyound my biggest wishes. The sink is roomy enough for my big cookie trays or even my 2 year old grandson. I can't wait to get into full baking mode with this sink as the clean up will be a snap. The sink was a tight fit but the contractor made it fit and it looks great.Blanco 511-652 Diamond Super Single Bowl Kitchen Sink, Anthracite Finish"
5,Beautiful sink,Wife loves the new sink. Loves the deep and large single sink. Mounted under the counter and it looks great. A well built and designed product.
3,Open box immediately & check sink,"Normally this type of non review irritates me, but in the hopes it saves someone some hassles I'll do it anyway.Please, if you are in the habit of leaving deliveries unopened, perhaps til they are needed, DON'T.Our new sink arrived in a completely undamaged box and had I not read (here) about checking for hairline fractures, we would not have opened the box. If undamaged the contents should be also, right? Wrong! Without even removing the Styrofoam forms it was clear the sink was broken ... one entire side was off and a corner as well, might be more, we didn't look further.As usual, AMAZON's customer service was superb, within 10 minutes we received the return label and our replacement should be here tomorrow. Can't wait to give a review about how wonderful it is"
5,Better than expected,"I was hesitant on ordering a sink online that I had never seen in person before and with the thoughts of damage during transit time. The sink was packaged well, arrived sooner then expected and was easy to install. It is absolutely huge and looks great under mounted. In addition it was about $150 cheaper than similar models at my local stores which was a big plus. The color is not pure white, it does seem to have little grayish speckles in it but I think that helps give it a nice unique look. I partnered it with my St Cecilia Granite countertops and it is a great compliment to them."
1,poor quality,"I recieved this camera as a gift, when I opened it I was so excited because it looks like an expensive piece of equipment at first glance. Once I picked it up I saw that it was very light and flimsy. It uses AAA batteries which concerns me onwhether or not it will be powerful enough or have good battery life at all. It WILL NOT take pictures in an area where the light is dim! Outside it will allow for ok video but to zoom in or out is useless, this camera does not have good focus from any more that 3 feet away. If you intend to use this camera for actual picture taking or video that is not 3 feet close and outside, dont waist your money!"
3,Pleased,"This device isnt spetacular, but it is all around pleasing. Its crap for low light video, but the flash makes up for its camera features in poor light, and what dufass settles for crap rechargeble batteries when Lithuims are the only choice for Digital products. I also dont know to many cameras that acts as a storage device and Mp3 player. That gives it my pleased rating, but it is far from a 5 star spetacular. Besides, now I leave my overpriced Nano home to enjoy music on what I manly use as just a camera."
4,good but could have been great,"This book makes the same mistake most every other book does having to do with game design in that the author assumes the reader has never played a video game before and spends the first few chapters explaining ""game design concepts"" that are beyond obvious and would only benefit someone who has lived in a cave for the last 10 years. When the authors finally get around to explaining how to do game levels, they dont give any particular button pushing instructions, its all ""we did this, and then we did this....."". Despite these shortcomings this book is quite a bit better than the other books on game level design that are out there."
4,"Competitive price, outstanding service","These baoding balls are the stereotyped article: polished steel balls with interior chimes that come in a Chinese-embroidered case. The quality is fine, and the price and shipping charges were competitive. What really distinguishes this order, though, is the fast turnaround I got, which included delivery via UPS and order-tracking all the way.I should point out that at 50mm (about two inches) wide, these balls do not seem large but they are really VERY large for the person who wants to use them for hand exercises. Few if any people will be able to start right out and roll two of these guys around in the hand without clacking them or dropping them. For beginners, the 35 to 40mm range is better. (I believe The Martial Arts Store has a smaller version which they call ""medium."") Regardless of your choice, in my experience TMAS is a fine store to do business with."
4,"excellent Iron Baoding Balls, Poor case....","Delivery time was as expected. The product was well packed. I am thinking of purchasing more exercise ball. However, none of the cases closed properly. I was really disappointed with the quality of the cases. Please improve on the cases and I think you will have one of the best products on the market."
1,My balls are damaged...,"I ordered a pair of the medium iron baoding balls several weeks ago as a gift for my boyfriend. Although they shipped and arrived quite promptly, the box was of poor quality and the baoding balls themselves were damaged. They appeared to be used, with scratches and even nicks in the balls. As each ball was wrapped individually and nestled into the fitted box, these damages could not have resulted from shipping.I am disappointed and am now back to searching for another gift I can get to replace these."
3,"Great Product, Shabby case","The product itself is not something I use regularly. I deal in a client based business, so I bought these to help me find my center if I incur some bad calls. It's been three years and so far the balls still ring true, weight just right, and are polished smoothly with no rust. Since the case is featured as part of the product, I gave it a lower rating being that the fabric has been unraveling since it arrived and the contruction and materials are of poor quality and looks saggy and sad. This makes a simple and affordable gift for friends, co-workers, and clients."
4,boading balls,I had to order a set of smaller sized balls but then with practice have been able to work my way up to using these as part of my therapy after wrist surgery. Working well for me now.
1,terrible,"My book never came. I checked with the post office, like they suggested, and it's not there either. It was imperative that I received this book before school started. The whole process was very frustrating."
3,"A practical, useful book","Originally an American farmer, Colborn is an agriculture journalist who serves on the Royal Horticultural Society Council in Great Britain. His book is practical, and includes how-to illustrations and artful photographs.Segmented into three parts, Colburn discusses the productive garden {kitchen garden, old-fashioned plants, and storing & preserving}, the ornamental garden {flower garden, old-fashioned plants, and exterior decorating}, and the working garden {tools & equipment, propagation, and soil & cultivation}.This book is less of a reference text and more of a book you will want to curl up with to spark plans from. Definitely for the serious gardener.160 pages, including introduction, photographs, illustrations, bibliography, and index"
3,Good info.,"This is a good video on the different Yorkie cuts. However, I think that the special grooming needs for this breed, ie bathing, ears,anal glands,etc. should have been included instead of being advised in the video that an additional purchase would be required to learn the basic grooming instruction/education on Yorkies. This would have been an excellent video had that been included. Educating the owner on proper care is part of the grooming process."
5,Fast data via PCMCIA!!!,This enables the easy convenience of connecting the new Firewire 800 (1394b) right to your notebook! It also has a Firewire 400 (1394a) port!
5,The First Blaze that's BLAZED for me!,"I was fairly new to the Blaze line when I picked up A Touch of Silk by Lori Wilde... and I wanted to give the line one more chance to hook me before I called it quits and gave up on the entire series. But, after reading it, I know I'll be back for more!Not only is Ms. Wilde a very talented author, her characters are well crafted, engaging, intriguing, and totally believable! There is more to A Touch of Silk than a lot of the other Blazes I've read.This book had everything a romance should have... a great plot, amazing, sensual characters, a steamy romance, and deep emotion.I loved every second of it and I can't wait until the next part of her Alaskan wife hunters hits the shelf in July with Duets!This is a can't miss in the Blaze series!"
5,Great stuff!!!!,"My husband swears by this product. Great for African American males with bump problems. He's learned that the company will no longer distribute the product. Oh well, when this runs out he'll be trying somethingelse!"
1,dissappointing product,"Bought this for my husband, he used it for a couple days and then tossed it. Did not find it useful at all. He has some other products we purchased that are more effective. A real dissappointment."
3,"Good, but not great","This is a book with a lot of good information. However, that good info is masked in an unnecessary fixation with numbers. It probably would have been better if the author focused more on the meat and potatoes of explaining how Alexander accomplished his reign. It still is an amazing read I would recommend to anyone interested in logistics and/or supply."
5,An unparalleled study in military logistics,"Despite the somewhat obscure title, this is a great read. Engels traces the journey of Alexander and his army across Asia and, using mostly quantitative analysis, explains how they managed to keep themselves fed through it all. In some cases, as in the Gedrosian desert, they didn't -- with devastating results. I've read many books on Alexander but this offers a fresh perspective, explaining not only what happened but why it happened. If only more history were written this way."
4,Worth it,"Love this addon. I bought both the battery for the camera and for the base station. They do not have enough umph to go all night via battery, but having the ability to unplug either unit and move them around for play sessions in the yard, or activites in other rooms without having to move plugs is invaluable. Highly recommended."
4,rechargeable battery for SVAT GX515 camera,Batteries were shipped quickly and received them within a week. One battery was bad and SVAT replaced it. Very satisfied with product.
5,Great tripod at any price--But the deal is what hooked me!!,"I've been researching and pricing tripods for about a month now, but when this deal came along with free shipping, I couldn't resist. I have looked at the Velbon DF-40 in photo departments of stores and really like the versatility and quality of this model, and when I received my order from Amazon, several days early and in excellent condition, I was NOT disappointed. It does everything I need a tripod to do, and it's very easy to transport just about anywhere because of it's compact size. Super product form Velbon and super service from Amazon--Who could ask for more??"
4,Good for the price!,Paying $25 for this tripod is worth it. It held my Nikon D200 quite well with a 18-200mm VR lens on it. Some moving parts are made of plastic and you probably cant abuse it like some other expensive ones out there...You should buy this tripod and determine how much usage you have before buying the more expensive one.
4,Good stand for price.,"I didn't need anything fancy, and this is much nicer than the similarly priced items at the local electronics stores."
3,Upper level text with a wide array of countries,"This book stands apart from the other comparative pol. books because of its lengthy introductory unit (almost 150 pages in 7 chapters). Some of it is very deep analytical material which is appropriate for very advanced students, but most high school readers will die of confusion if boredom doesn't finish them off first.For the country chapters, they are very thorough, and each is 40-50 chapters, quite a lot of material. It's pretty dense, too. One good thing is that the book includes the usual ""big"" ones (G.B., France, Russia, China) as well as Germany and Mexico, but also India, Nigeria, Brazil, and Egypt, giving much material for the often overlooked less-developed countries."
2,....,very bold title for what you get..its a mixture of architectural renderings of never-to be build structures with 'wannabe' structural engineering book..level of your disappointment will depend on your expectations..i expect more thorough and detailed explanation of tall building-structural-architectural design problems..I didn't give 1 star only because of the author- well known and respected structural engineer.
1,Extremely poor service,"I purchased subscription on December 23, 2006. Trusted Amazon to deliver a good service. The estimate for delivery was 4-6 weeks. Now, it is March 7, 2007; the magazine has never arrived; the provider of subscriptions first kept promising ""any week now"" but now they say I wouldn't start my subscription until mid-April. No explanation why. Cannot cancel and get a refund of $150. Extremely disappointed. Should have ordered directly - another French weekly, subscribed directed from the publisher a month ago and already received two issues. I am not even sure at this point I would receive my paid subscription for Paris-Match. I contacted the publisher and they told me they provide US subscriptions through a completely different agent. So, Amazon, what do I do now about my subscription?"
1,Very disapointing,"So many issues missing. Followed-up twice via Amazon and no actions taken. Will not order a french magazine via Amazion anymore. When ordered directly, things go more smoothly.Very disapointing service over the phone - not at all helpful."
1,Lozy Service,"Be very aware, this subscription service goes thru a third party and all I can say is good luck. They advertised a one year subscription and I received 6 months. No resolution to this issue, very shifty, definitely not recommended for any purchaser."
5,"Easy ""Fresh"" Grated Ginger","This is a great product if you like to use grated ginger but are often in a hurry. It keeps a long time in the fridge, so keeping a supply of unopened tubes on hand is not a problem."
2,"Good information, but difficult to plan a trip","I visited Paris for one week ten years ago. My wife travelled to Paris 3 times for the last few years. So we thought ""Paris Revisited"" was good for us for our spring vacation. Yet, it's not quite. First, most of this book is plain text. It is not friendly as a tour book. Second, a lot of good information does not help plan a trip unless you plan to live in Paris for a month. Third, some practical information has been out-dated since it was written in 2003. One good thing though, was that I enjoyed reading this book at a leisure time if I need not to plan a trip."
2,Well... I bought it.,"So, I recently ordered this disc, and the Advanced copy as well, and I must say. No.I cannot even look at these forms, It really upset me overall the way these forms werebeing done. I practice two martial arts, Shotokan and Kenpo. Shotokan practices theseparticular kata, while my variation of Kenpo does not. But I must say, each form wasdone poorly and was not executed in a manner akin to Kenpo. (I was very nice here.)Next, I'll give you some positives. The Instructor in the disc says to only use thedisc to jog your memory of what you already know, and not to learn from it. He's right,please don't. Secondly, it's super cheap, and I am sure this is why. You get what youpay for overall.For good good Kenpo, especially if your staying away from Ed Parker Kenpo, researchUltimate Kempo by: Jeff Driscol. I found this to be and excellent resource for me."
2,Kenpo Forms,"I was not aware that this DVD is all about Kenpo forms not fighting ""system"".The forms are so much similar to the TKD and Soo Bahk Do forms. I wish thatthe publisher mentioned that this is all that it is. FORMS."
2,Very rough,It was very disappointing... very rough and thin. I found a better deal at a department store.
3,Great Price,"Towels were good size, a little rough for my taste, even after a couple of washes...but for the price, a good deal."
3,"Functional but thin, and the label says ""Utica""...","These are good for $2.24 (per towel) that I paid. They are light and on the thinner side, but the color (slate) is very nice. The label on the towel says ""Utica"", though--since it's marketed as Martex, shouldn't it be a Martex product?"
4,The Cheating Heart,"Hi, I think the cheating heart was ok, however the end wasnt as exciting as others, but the culprit was hard to guess, but it was a really good book!"
3,Copenhagen Ring,"This is a very uneven production of the Ring, it is perhaps the best dramatic version of the Ring, but many in the cast are weak, and this is above all true of Brunhilde who is so foolishly made the center of this production. I regret that I bought this and would be happy to sell it.tjja@verizon.net"
2,A Provincial Ring,"If you are a pro-Wagnerian, you probably don't mind spending $80 for a provincial Ring. If you are a novice, Chéreau/Boulez's Ring is the one to go. If you do mind spending $80 just for The three Norns and/or the discussion of the Queen and the producer, then save your money for a bottle of Bordeaux or single malt."
3,The Feminists' Ring,"I saw this Ring live in Copenhagen, and look forward to this souvenir of the production on DVD. An interesting, modern interpretation with a decidedly ""feminist"" leaning: the whole story is essentially Brunnhilde's flashback on her family history, with her now pregnant at the end but spared immolation.Cast was good-to very good, with the rising Theorin a more than acceptable Brunnhilde (she rises to Isolde this year at Bayreuth), James Johnson a servicable Wotan, and the energizer bunny Stig Andersen a known quantity as Siegfried (and I remember him also doing Siegmund in my cycle). Direction is interesting, if not necessarily true to Wagner.Let's hope they've included footage of the new Copenhagen house itself - one of the real reasons to visit!"
5,Finally RE-UNEARTHED for the FUNK fans,"If you're willing to shell out 40 bucks, try to find one of the Rhino Handmade copies (numbered edition of only 5000). The Rhino Edition includes the ""Jams From The Heart"" EP material, which is terrific. This album shells 'em too, but the 2006 REISSUE on Collector's Choice won't have the EP material on it. It should be available as of late August 2006. A very worthy set for anyone who collects P-FUNK, 70's post-Hendrix guitar jammage, or guitar fans in general."
5,Eddie Hazel is amazing!!!,"All I can say is this CD is amazing! Eddie Hazel and his guitar playing is nothing short of spectacular. This is a CD for all lovers and admirers of Hendrix, Living Colour, Bad Brains, Mother's Finest, and Betty Davis should have in their collection. Listening to this makes you wonder why this genius and his talents have gone almost unnoticed until now. Anyone who is a true aficianado of great music, Eddie Hazel's ""Games, Dames, and Guitar Thangs"" will not disappoint."
5,An interesting peek at post-Funkadelic Eddie Hazel,"I'll never forget the first time that I heard Funkadelic's music, and 20 years later, I'm still listening to it. Sure, the Parliament stuff is what made them famous, but the earlier work is what I like. If you've never listened to it, you owe it to yourself to get copies of the first 3 Funkadelic albums: Free Your Mind and Your Ass Will Follow, Funkadelic, and Maggot Brain. Pure 1970s black soul & funk, intense and hilarious lyrics, drenched in a bath of LSD for good measure. This album isn't of the caliber of his work with Funkadelic, but it's an interesting peek into the mind of a great guitarist before he destroyed himself with substance abuse. This is Eddie Hazels only solo release, and it appears to be now out of print. For those who are interested, get a copy while you still can."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"Ms. Kress has created a unique alien culture, which shares a unanimous moral sense of right, wrong, and reality. Any divergent thoughts are punished by a blinding headpain, and individuals who act contrary to the ""shared reality"" are ostracized. Ms. Kress chose to juxtapose this storyline with a parallel plot about a mysterious artifact from another alien species, and throw in a third alien enemy to boot. The elements of these two story lines just don't work together. Dr. Bazargan is the most interesting and realistic character in the human anthropological team. David Allen is repugnant, and meant to be, but his one-sidedness makes him merely a plot device. The totally unlikely presence of two human infants on the team provides the occasion for a monstrous cruelty, and as such, is a cheap shot at our emotions. I wish Ms. Kress had thrown out this plot outline and explored her idea in a different way."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Humans have discovered ancient alien technology, and have also discovered current real live aliens that really don't like them at all.In the middle of a war that isn't going too well an expedition discovers some possible useful technology.However, the planet it is on has a strange society, their belief in their consensual reality is what drives them, and outsiders are ostracised and more."
3,Interesting Probabilities.,"Probability Moon by Nancy Kress has a good storyline and excellent techie science. The characterizations were good, even the aliens were easy to get to know and understand and so was their alien environment. The banal treatment of the alien's complete conformity was jarring. Among them everybody knew everybody else's thoughts and everybody agreed with everyone else. This created a great contrast with the earthlings who were constantly forced to think out of the box, and one of them was even out of his mind. Good read!"
2,A Surprisingly Disappointing Book,"A whole world where all people share the same beliefs or reality together - without question. This fantastic premise could have generated a number of intriguing scenarios. But the author tried to spice it up with the hackneyed themes of interstellar warfare, supersmart ancient aliens, technologically challenged natives and come up with a novel that leaves you totally unsatisfied. On top of that the Physics described is juvenile fanatsy. The author 's talents lie in divining how genetic engineering can alter society and people. Stick to that larger theme. Wonder if Mr. Nancy Kress wrote the novel and passed it on as his wife's."
1,Beware of Joel Green's postmodern trappings,"After nearly destroying Asbury of its Biblical heritage Green escaped to Fuller. Why this deceiver is allowed to edit this series is beyond me.I am not saying there is no value to be found, but be aware that Green has ulterior motives."
3,More Emphasis on Cultural Information Than on the Text,"Joel Green offers alot of historical and cultural information in his study of Luke's Gospel. He has a lot of information about table fellowship in the Greco-Roman world. He is also concerned with the universal scope of the gospel in Luke, noting the author's interest in women disciples and in the vindication of the poor (Luke 6:22ff, Luke 16:19-31).My main concern with this commentary is that there is too heavy of an emphasis on the cultural background of the text and not always enough emphasis on the exposition of the text. Those looking for more theological reflection may want to consult Joel Green's outstanding book ""The Theology of the Gospel of Luke,"" a book that was so sound that I had to give it 5 stars.This commentary on Luke is helpful for those looking for more socio-historical data, but I would not recommend using it as your main commentary. Pride of place for commentaries on Luke must go to the two volume set by Darrell Bock."
1,Did Iris Really Write This?,"I have read several Iris Johansen books and enjoyed them, but this one is something else! It seems to me that it wasn't even Iris who wrote the book. It was awful! I always pass on my used paperbacks to friends for them to enjoy, but this one went in the trash. Had to force myself to finish it and now I'm sorry."
5,Killer Dreams,I always enjoy Iris Johansen's books. This one was right on the money for a thriller. I am always glad to see new works from her.I recommend her to all my friends.
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"I recently graduated college. Working full-time and going to school full-time put a damper on my recreational reading. I was in the grocery store recently looking at the NY Times' Best Seller List & this was in the top five. I decided to give it a try.I was really excited about getting into reading again for no other reason than pleasure, but unfortunately, this book turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.I normally become so engrossed in a book that I have to limit the number of pages I read a day or I find myself reading into the wee hours of the night. Instead, with this book, I found that I sometimes had to force myself to pick it up just to get through it.This isn't the worst book in the world, but after waiting so long to read again, this turned out to be the wrong one to pick as my first. I was hoping that the NY Times would point me in the right direction. I guess I won't be checking their lists any more."
1,Worse than painful!!,"I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer. Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase ""Sophie said through her teeth..."" I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book. Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this! I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline!"
1,Very disappointing.,"I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly."
2,Disappointing,"I usually enjoy her books but this one was truly disappointing. Such a silly plot. I finished it but kept saying to myself...""Why not just toss this one?""."
1,Unreadable,"I bought this at Barnes and Noble because the jacket copy looked promising, but it was an empty promise. I gave up after about 70 pages. It took that long to get a clear inkling of what was going on, which is not much. More annoying was the constant challenge between characters, even characters who are otherwise friendly with one another. Johansen's characters always seem to be in challenge-mode. No statement, no matter how innocuous, seems to be accepted without a, ""Yeah, but,"" or ""Don't be such a jerk"" sort of reply. That soon becomes old. Much of the dialogue is unreal anyway, but everyone seems to act like macho-man trying to leave a tough-guy impression. Not a fun read."
1,Awful Book--Could not finish it!,This is the first Iris Johansen book I have ever read and I will never read another one. The lady cannot write. Characters are so bad you will find yourself not caring what happens to them and ultimately throw the book away. Somehow she has a deal where her books are in all the major airports so she is destined to get a high volume of sales but sooner rather than later people will see through this mindless babble she is offering and quit reading her books.
2,Yaaaaaaaawn,"I was drawn in by the dust jacket blurb, in the end I was skimming through just to get it finished. Painfully predictable with boring steriotypical characters."
1,bad,"i don't want to read anymore after i read half of it.this book swears, curses...bad writing, bad language, bad storythis is my first book of the author, after this, i don't want any books by this author though some reviews said that other books of her is good"
3,NightScapes,"KILLER DREAMS by Iris Johansen was given to me by a friend and it was a fun light thriller to read on breaks, which reminded me of some Fern Michaels' stories. In the seventies mind control was a heavy subject and lithium was portrayed as being the drug for inducement into a water supply. Bouncing back and forth across the Atlantic with seemingly no other purpose than to eliminate a few innocent bystanders and introduce another zombie killer for disposal confuses the reader.A good book to borrow from a friend or the library, but not a keeper. I may read others by Ms. Johansen, but not until I reduce the stacks a bit.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS and WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS."
2,2 1/2 Stars,"Two years ago, Dr. Sophie Dunston's life was shattered. Today, she's a sleep therapist at a hospital in Baltimore. And...she wants to kill Sanborne, the control freak founder of the pharmaceutical company where she used to work. He has sinister uses for the REM-4 that she had developed as a cure for people with night terrors. When Sanborne sees her on a security tape, he decides she must go. Enter Jock, Royd, MacDuff and the whole gang to protect her and her son and to put a permanent end to Sanborne and his partner.As other reviewers have noted, this is kind of the same old story with new names and a few characters and locations from previous stories."
1,Iris's favourite new words!,"He stiffened, she stiffened, everyone stiffened! People had stiffened seven times by the time I reached page 46. Doesn't anyone edit her work? Another annoying word she uses to death is 'grimaced'. It's very distracting, and I lost all interest and quit reading by page 60. Thank heavens the book was a loaner from the library.I seem to remember everyone stiffening and grimacing in ""On the Run"" as well (which by the way was another terrible book). If these two books are any indication of what we can now expect from Ms. Johansen, perhaps it's time for her to retire. All I can say is ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me!"" There isn't going to be a third time."
2,Great hook... but the actual story?!,"I picked up this story at my in-laws. I read the prologue and was instantly hooked! What? How? Where? What is going on?!The story itself picks up 2 years after the craziness of the prologue, and aside from terrible dreams, we aren't let on to what happened back then. Which is fine. The plot of the story, such as it is, is actually very good.However, the convoluted story telling, the absolutely unbelievable way that characters met and bonded, the snidely-whiplash bad guy, and the overall feeling of ""this story must be continued from a bunch of other books I haven't read"" just made me want to brush my brain after I read it.I did stick it out, not sure why. I finished it. And I won't be reading anything by Iris Johansen any time soon.(*)>"
1,painful,"Silly plot, inane dialogue (characters said ""The hell I will"" at least 7 times in one chapter alone), cardboard characters.... Three chapters and I couldn't take it anymore. Johansen is capable of much better than Killer Dreams. The Search, about search and rescue workers and their dogs, was terrific."
2,ugggh,"I've read every one of Iris Johansen's ""suspense"" novels and have loved most of them. The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish. I read where someone called these characters ""cardboard,"" and I couldn't agree more. The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist. Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class. ""Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after.""I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time."
1,Don't bother,"I normally don't take the time to review books however I felt I must comment in this instance. This book is painfully plagued with ""romantic"" desires. The main character Sophie drove me insane. All the characters kept talking about how strong she was yet she was extremely pathetic. If I had to hear the phrase ""The hell I will"", ""Michael"" or that she was moistening her lips one more time I thought I was going to vomit. Johansen is normally a fantastic author but I was quite disappointed with this one. This book seemed thrown together just to get another novel on the stand. I will say if she had taken out all the silly lust and ridiculous one liners the story could have been much much better. I just started Stalemate and so far it's fantastic."
3,Disappointing to say the least,"This could have been a real thriller had I liked any of the characters or even cared what happened to them. The only likable character in this story is Michael, the protagonist's 10-year old son. The lead woman, Sophie, has little character and few morales, given that she is hounded for sex by her would-be knight in shining armor, and decides to give in to him because ""it's only sex."" From the beginning I wasn't sympathetic with her and by the end I was disgusted with her. Iris Johansen is capable of much better writing than this--just read her early Eve Duncan novels and see for yourself. I'll have to think about purchasing any further novels. I believe she's slipping into ""what sells"" kind of plots. And for a writer of her caliber, that's a shame."
2,Terrible,"This is the most poorly written book that I have read by the author. I picked it up because I have an interest in sleep disorders but I was dissapointed. The repetitive style becomes tiring. We know the principals are going to sleep together if only he would shut his mouth and stop whispering romantic nothings in her ear, i.e., ""am I going to get lucky?"".This could have been a really great book but the author didn't come through. When reading one gets the impression that she just wanted to complete a book and many sentences were there only to make it the proper lenght. The plot was very contrived and the major points were repeated again and again as if to say ""get it!"".I've read Johansen before and she can do better. Much better!"
2,defective tape,not a bad novel but never got to finish because it came apart in my car tape player. It came in good time and the jacket was perfect.
4,Enjoyed seeing familiar characters.,"This may not have been her best novel, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was nice to see some of the characters from her previous novels in new adventures. If I hadn't read some of them I might have been lost with the REM-4 plot line."
1,A Total Clap,"Unreal, flat characters in a class D Holywood movie situation. Sunday school writing. One star is because there's no zero. It's hard to believe she's allowed to publish so many books."
4,Killer Dreams,"I loved this one as I do all of the Eve Duncan series. Even though - Eve and Quinn were only mentioned and not a big part of this book - McDuff is one of my favorite characters- along with Jock...and it shows a new side of Jock that I had wondered about. I love the mystery, suspense but a little too much romance for me. The plot was believable and kept me going from page one. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery."
2,"Gave Johansen another chance, regretted it","After reading 'Countdown', I was reluctant to read another book by the same author, but after receiving two more books by her from a co-worker, I thought, well, it's a free book and maybe this book will be better!... Unfortunately, it isn't. I find the same stilted, sparse storywriting here. This is connected with the aforementioned Countdown, happening after that book and reintroducing MacDuff and Jane. I found the story to be boring and predictable."
3,"Great, but wait!","This book is written from black's point of view and will encourage you to play the Modern Benoni once again. Many of John Watson's (indeed most) suggestions are excellent. However be sure you try them out in some blitz games before staking yourself to a verbatim repetition! A couple are, shall we say, interesting? Especially requiring care are those concerning the dreaded f4 & Bb5+ lines. All in all very worth buying but requiring lots of independent thinking."
1,Bad choice,I was looking for a shoe stretcher. This is definitely Not it! I get the same result putting paper in my shoes as these things.
3,Not great,"I wear somewhere between a 7.5-8 and these trees are way to small to stretch my shoes. I have to shove a bunch of socks to fill in the empty space. Also, the toe part isn't big enough to make a difference in the width of the shoe and I have narrow feet. I wish I would have ordered a larger size."
1,Brash and unpolished,"This book was pretty awful. I expected a thoughtful and well-educated approach to the subject matter at hand. Instead, this book was very brash (and not very well edited).As others have noted, it is good if you want to get an overall understanding of the ins and outs of a medical practice. However, it leaves much to be desired with regard to thorough advice I would feel comfortable following on the specific topics mentioned. The author definitely needs to become more educated in the way of computers, for that section was highly outdated even for 2004 (when the book was published)."
2,The Caustic Guide to Management,"Having started a solo practice after being with an HMO, I'm always on the lookout for new ways to make my practice better. This book, however, isn't one of them. The advice at times to be a little inconsistant, going between doing it all yourself (which is what I'm doing) and hiring a practice consultant. His methods for dealing with employees is quite heavy handed - I'm quite sure I wouldn't want to work for him.His comments on EMR software is quite laughably bad - using Word to do notes is so old and inefficent that I'm willing to bet a lot of things must slip between the cracks in his practice.Overall, its tough to recommend this book because the advice is off on things like EMRs, and the employee managing style is written by someone who obviously doesn't have a lot of leadership experience."
2,"Useful viewpoint, but poorly written","Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this book presents an interesting viewpoint. In effect, the author proposes an extremely hands-on approach to running your practice and esentially makes the case that a solo practice is the only way to go.The reason I wanted to post a review is that I simply could not believe the incredible number of typos and grammatical errors in the book. It was terribly distracting and made the book very hard to read. It seems like it was never reviewed by an editor before being published."
4,Concise advice on medical practice management,"A condensed practice management book. An easy, interesting read, with lots of good pointers and advice to serve as a starting point or food for thought for those already in practice. The author is sharp-minded and witty, if a bit paranoid ('do everything yourself / it won't get done right unless you do it yourself' approach)."
2,Not Helpful,"As an R.N./Manager of a rural clinic, I bought this with expectations of a manual of day to day operations. Scheduling, personnel conflict,(beyond just firing bad employees), how to deal with patients who pose a challenge, i.e. drug seekers. Things of that nature. I realize now that I'm the wrong audience for this text. It is geared more to residents and new M.D.s I understand that, but the thing that made me crazy was all of the typos. Skimming through, I found five typos. The amusing part was the emphasis in the book of cutting staff down to minimum-apparently that goes for copy editors as well.Skip this for pure medical office management-probably useful for M.D.'s starting, or finding themselves confused."
5,Practice Management: A Practical Guide to Starting and Running a Medical Office,"This is very good book. A bit opinionated, but insightful. If you don't know where to start, this is an excellent book for you."
2,more sitcom than scifi,"The time travel and life extension premise is great, but she doesn't do much with it. The rest of the book is full of sarcastic and irritating characters who really are not likeable that reads like a television sitcom. Once I realized I wasn't going to get a satisfying sci-fi experience and lowered my expectations to rock bottom, it was readable in a tawdry way. I might try another one though as the second novel is purportedly much better."
3,Disappointing!,"I picked up this book because of some recommendations from friends on Shelfari. I was greatly disappointed!This book starts out so well, describing the Company, time travel and immortality and then goes to Spain in the 1500's where a little girl (Mendoza) is rescued from the Inquisition and put in a ""special program"" with other children. They are trained and receive a number of surgeries that transform them into Cyborgs. The book then goes downhill from there as Mendoza is sent on her task to work in 1500's England during the end of Queen ""Bloody"" Mary's reign. From there it is painfully dull and very difficult to finish.What also made this book difficult was that the vast infrastructure that was set up underground in the 1500's is very unbelievable. This book is definately not on my recommended list!"
3,GREAT IDEA! Horrible delivery,"I'm sorry to say that Kage Bakers book has a wonderful idea and a well developed world but her writing as a whole has something to be desired. It is a cure for insomniacs... Perhaps this is because I'm a guy and this book was written by a woman with a female main character but I managed to get around half way through this book and decide that watching television was a better use of my time. I'm sorry this book was just plain boring. Once the main character becomes a cyborg and gets her first assignment your hoping for really interesting and cool things. But this isn't the case. Perhaps I'm not into botany enough or don't have enough interest in early English history. I'm sorry to say this material needed a writer that could move the material along, Kage Baker isn't that writer."
1,Interesting idea,"It started off as an interesting idea - physically enhanced humans travelling though time. However, once the characters were introduced, it quickly shifted from a science fiction novel to a romance novel and spend over two thirds of the book in the love relationship of the two main characters. Unfortunately, none of the characters were very well developed and so I couldn't even make sense of what they were doing. As a sci-fi book goes, this is a big dissapointment. It might serve better to be classified as a romance novel."
2,In search of an original idea..,"I really do appreciate how original this book is. Most fantasy novels are very cliche and have a similar storyline and characters in them. This book was truly original. However I had a hard time following in some places of the book because she knows so much about the time period in which she is writing about, that she wrote too many details. I wouldn't recommend reading this to your children :)"
2,A Romance with a Little Sci Fi Thrown in,"I agree -- they should have had a picture of Fabio on the cover so people would know what they were getting into.The first couple chapters were ok, after that it got really slow and painful.If you like to turn on PBS and watch yet another slow English period drama that takes place on a declining English manor/estate, then you might enjoy this book."
3,Original? Yes. Sci-Fi? No.,"Garden of Iden by Kage Baker certainly is original but this is not a Sci-Fi. Except for the few pages in the early chapters, the story takes place entirely in the 16th Century England, evolving around a romance between Mendosa, the heroin and the time traveler and Nicholas. This is a historic romance period. So those who enjoy romance may enjoy this book but this is not for a serious Sci-Fi readers."
1,Eternal Life or Humanity,"This was the first book of Ms. Baker's I have read. It will not be the last. I found it engrossing, and thoughtful both on an ""enjoyable read"" level and a metaphysical level. The victorian language takes some concentration to get a grip on, but the moments of real insight are in plain English. Mendoza faces fear at a very early age, and will be facing it repeatedly throughout her very long life to come. Good reading."
2,"Great Concept, A Little Slow Paced","Great concept, entertaining read, decent characters - but moved quiet slow. Almost more of a romance novel than a time-travel SF novel. The characters are almost *too* powerful with their gadgets and physical upgrades. I guess at the end of the day, I would say it was a flat and bit depressing read."
4,"The point of this book is compelling, for us and the future.","This book takes us through a tour of 16th century England, a time populated not only by people you would expect, but those who you wouldn't: cyborgs with superpowers, not intent on altering the times but with observing and sampling it. One of the cyborgs has the bad fortune to fall in love with one of the ""mortals."" It is far from clear that she learns the lesson that we, the readers, can catch. You may be immortal, and you may have superpowers, and you may have time travel...but that doesn't make you any better than those who don't. As our own technology and our own powers grow, this is a warning for us as well."
3,In The Garden of Iden (Book 1),"This makes for a light, fast read. Probably better suited to a teen than an adult. Its a 'different' take on time travel than the usual. I liked it enough to order Book 2 but hope that there is a bit more substance to it than in Book 1."
2,"promising start, sputters out","The premise of this novel is really good - the mixing of time travel and immortality. But after the first chapter, the book falls flat on its face. It turns into, of all things, a love story taking place in a badly observed counter-reformation universe. Well, to those of you hankering for people that live forever - read P Andersons Boat of a Million Years, or even (oh no!) A Rice's Vampire books. And for those of you who want a modern take on an historical situation, C Willis' Doomsday Book is far superior to this. Too bad. Maybe Ms Baker will hit her stride in the next installment - i.e., use the hook of immortality and time travel instead of forgetting where she started (and why most people who will buy her book bought it indeed!)"
4,Wow! I mean...Wow!,"Simply wonderful. Not perfect, true, but definitely noteworthy, and even moreso for a first novel. Kage Baker's Dr. Zeus, Inc. and their time-travelling cabal is a fun concept, but I am very glad she chose instead to focus on the *story*, and not try to impress us with a lot of ""how clever am I?"" nonsense.Kage Baker has iron nerve, too, as she marches steadily onward to the logical conclusion. Brava to her for having the gumption to pull it off satisfyingly."
2,Valley Girl Meets Elizabethans,"In the 16th century a girl is rescued from the Spanish Inquisition, whisked to Australia for some secret training, and cybernetically altered into a genuis. What would you expect? Author Kage Baker clearly thinks the result must be a valley girl. This makes for a jarring incongruity which the novel never quite overcomes. Neither is it explained why our girl genius never seemed to have any affection for anybody, yet later somehow manages to fall in love. This book is typical of a certain sub-genre of sf which offers the illusion of character while missing the essential truth of the heart. Its first person narrator also provides detailed recollections of what happened to her when she was five - down to the things she didn't comprehend. Given the acclaim given ""Angela's Ashes"", this must now be acceptable even in ""nonfiction."" This reader finds it amateurish."
4,"Who's Afraid of a Big, Bad Bodice","""The Garden of Iden"" is not a bodice ripper, as it was so unfairly described by some readers. It is excellent soft science fiction, firmly grounded in historic detail and human character. Creative and very funny much of the time, it is an engrossing exploration of the unchanging nature of humans, from whatever time and under whatever strange circumstances. Poor Mendoza's tragic romance, hilarious though it often is, is completely predictable based on her horrific background, her age, the human need to connect and mankind's all too predictable need to eat that apple in the garden. It's a delightful story and I'm looking to pick up the next books. I suspect it's denigraded as a ""bodice ripper"" by those who have never picked up one of those silly books."
5,A masterful first novel.,"Kage Baker brings a number of strengths to the genre with her first in what could be a very promising series of time travel/ historical/ futuristic science fiction and fantasy. The premise is no more flawed than any other time travel fantasy, and the application offers many opportunities for storytelling.In this first story, Baker really brings it all together: the characters are compelling, the situations believable, the scenes tautly drawn, the drama is high, the narrative is relentless. Once I started this book I could not put it down.Perhaps best of all, the picture of the dark before the dawn of the Elizabethan era is exquisitely drawn. Baker has excellent command of the language (both contemporary and Elizabethan), and her take on the events at that time in history is fascinating."
5,"Leonard Neeble befriends Alan, travel inter-dimensionally","Life at Bat Masterson High School has been a tough adjustment for Leonard Neeble, who just moved to Hogboro, NJ. Teaming up with Alan Mendelsohn, he meets strange vagrants, cheating bookstore clerks, and otherworldly beings. Mostly, he skips school and breaks a lot of rules, unlike characters in most current young adult fiction. The protagonists of this story more closely resemble the daring adventurers of Mark Twain's fiction, which is most of what makes this book so enthralling. All of the plausible sci-fi, conspiracy and kookdom pull the reader in, but the impeccable humor makes the read stick. I've read it four times and want to to so again"
2,Not as pictured,"The track shown in the bag is the older model, which my son has. The track that arrives is the newer model in a box instead that doesn't fit the original design. I returned it and the customer service for this organization was outstanding. While I gave low stars for product when it's really N/A (Amazon site required stars before review could be posted). I give them 5 stars for service. Even indicated they would try to find the older version."
5,GREAT S0AP,"I WAS SURPRISED WHEN I FIRST G0T IT, IT SMELLS GREAT AND MY B0YFRIEND LIKES IT T00!! THANK Y0U VERY MUCH"
3,It was ok...,"I'm not a film student or anything, but I just felt it was missing something. I love the horror genre.. movies.. books and after reading the reviews I was expecting something more.The concept was interesting, can't say that the whole don't invite strangers into your house thing hasn't be done before.. but at least there were more twists to it than normally seen. I don't think this movie had any real suspense moments where Im looking through my fingers to see whats going to happen next.. it just kind of is what it is.. you think something is going to happen and you are mostly right.Maybe I missed something, but I was slightly confused as to one of the characters. Didn't really explain anything and you are just left thinking.. ok whats the deal? Or maybe it was so deep in meaning I missed it entirely. HAHA you never know.I say its worth the watch for something unique, but don't expect too much."
3,HOMEBODIES,"A deliciously evil performance from Patrick Breen as a psychotic serial killer elevates this grim Indie.Breen exudes a chilling charm as a mysterious stranger who insinuates himself into a deeply disturbed family with dark secrets of their own. Alexandra Chando plays ""Blackbird"", the strange teen who seems more than slightly off center. We soon learn Blackbird is more than a match for her captor.BLEEDING HOUSE deserves credit for a novel approach to the serial killer genre but I felt somewhat cheated by its ambiguous climax. However, Breen--who I remember from guest roles on LAW AND ORDER and THE GOOD WIFE--should definitely garner bigger roles in the future."
3,The Bleeding House - a literal title,"I didnt care for this movie. Its not a bad movie. In fact, its a fairly good movie as far as story and acting and allthat other stuff go but I don't care for medical devices."
1,Dreadful - and not in a good way,We've seen it before. A mysterious stranger arrives at your house and asks to stay the night. What do you do? Ok - add this: you and your family have a terrible secret and you need desperately to keep yourselves isolated from everyone and everything and a mysterious stranger arrives at your house and asks to stay the night. What do you do? Or this: You're a horror fan and your best friend writes a gruelingly bad script and asks your opinion on it. Do you let him raise thousands of dollars and shoot the film or do you tell him the truth? It stinks. Try again. Awful.
3,Great story even though not in great shape,Was not in great shape but the artwork in this graphic novel (thankfully) very dark. Was hoping it would be in better shape but it's complete & satisfactory.
1,Not worth your money,"Frequently demonstrably wrong, and regularly claims ""facts"" that do not seem to occur in any other source, casting serious doubt upon their authenticity. Anyone repeating anything from this book runs a severe risk of perpetuating inaccuracies. For example, the claim in the blurb that ""Twenty people literally ""drowned in beer"" in 1814 when a vat in a London brewery exploded"" is simply not true - only eight people died, all when buildings collapsed, and the vat never ""exploded"", one of the hoops broke and it collapsed."
2,Kinda badly written,"I was expecting it to be a book and really it's like a book of quotations. Some good stuff about the ancient history of beer, which is really why I got it, but most of it is just quotations, that don't even necessarily have anything to do with beer they just have a word in it that relates to it. Pretty disappointed, but there is some good historical stuff."
3,Chilled out deathbeats,"Yeah, ATR... great. The whole reason I bought this cd was for the Techno Animal additional production, and boy, does it show. While his own efforts of illbient are a little hard to swallow due to total bleakness, the hardcore asthetic livens things up to at least a few degress above absolute zero. Sounds somewhat like icecubes being ground up in an enormous machine that tears them apart, and somehow reassembles them, leading one to suspect that they have more icecubes somewhere in the machine. To wit, the best parts of the album arrive on Low-Tech predator, when the crunchy guitars of ATR combine with a decaying siren effect, producing something you might actually remember after popping out the disk."
2,"Not Wendy, but who is?","The drawings are crude, but, for those who keep up with the comics, going back to these rough-ups makes you appreciate how much these new artists have improved. For those who don't keep up? Have faith, it gets better, steadily"
2,Awful,"The pictures are ugly, but a few of the stories are all right...there are attempts at humor...but I would not recommend this book at all."
1,This is an unfortunate edition to the Elfquest series,"I would in no way recommend this book, even to the most die-hard Elfquest fans. The art is uninteresting and usually unrecognizable, the text is flat, and the importance of these stories to the overall series is non-existant. Stick to the stories and art actually done by the Pinis; apparently their editing skills are far below the standard that their creative original work sets."
5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I really enjoyed this book. Seeing different art is sort of strange, but some stories are actually kind of funny."
3,antigone,"I only bought it for a class , but its interesting. It is translated from greek. It is very philosophical"
1,Dissappointing,"While I truly enjoyed the first book of the series (Her Majesty's Wizard), I found this and subsequent books in the series to be a major dissappointment. The main character never seems to learn anything, nor does Stasheff follow up with his leads from the previous book. Whatever happened to Max telling Sir Guy what orders to give? Or Matt realizing, after a year as a wizard in this world, that words have power? Major gaps like this shouldn't happen even in a poorly-written series; a Wizard in Rhyme had the potential to be so much more."
5,"Great concept, terrific novel","The impact of street drugs on the mentally ill or people who are prone to mental illness has surprisingly drawn little interest given the provocative subject matter.The Late Man, a novel by Michael B. Davie, follows one young man's descent into madness after a drug overdose in an isolated cabin in Ontario's north country. We then follow this same young man after he escapes into a world that has changed dramatically, a world he cannot identify or cope with. This is one of the best novels I've read in years. It's well-written and absolutely fascinating."
4,A few hidden gems from the 50's & 60's,"Some of these songs have only appeared on CBS Christmas compliation albums in the 60's. I have not run across the Mike Douglas ""Touch Hands on Christmas Morning"" since it's appearance on a CSP LP for Grant's Department Stores in 1967. Audio quality is pretty decent for the age of the recordings. The shear quantity of the music makes it well worth $14.Happy Holidays."
3,Kick Dis Power Puck,"I bought this item for my 10 yr old son. I wasn't sure it would be something that he would like after I recieved it. He opened it up and it has some charge so he used it right away. I have to say it was pretty cool. You do need to do it on a smooth surface like a hardwood floor or outside but it really hovers above ground and you can kick it around and it moves pretty fast. I don't know much more you can do with it though. He played with it a few times but that's it. I think a bigger space like a basketball court would work better for this item, it is fun but their is only so much you can do with it."
3,Our Daily Bread,"Most romance novels end in ""happily ever after."" ""Boy gets girl, they get married, the end."" This novel takes one inside the marriage, and gives a realistic perspective of married life. I gave it 3 stars because of several storylines that didn't really add meaning to novel, and I feel they disturbed the flow of the story."
4,Great read,I really enjoyed reading this book. Although I wish the story could have been longer. I thought I knew exactly how the story was going to play out but there were a few surprises.
4,Good story,"This was my 1st book by this author and I loved the story! Love, faith, hope and forgiveness is what marriage is all about. However I thought some parts were a bit slow and the funeral was dragged out too much. I would have liked to see the characters more developed instead. But overall a good book. This book is the 1st in a trilogy."
5,Forgive Us This Day,"This is a very good book from beginning to end. Mrs. Barbara Joe-Williams did a good job developing the characters and the issues they faced. The chararcters appear to be real people dealing with real problems. Just as it is in life, just because a person is dealing with one personal crisis does not mean the next crisis will wait until the crisis is over before it surfaces. The two main characters have what it takes to make it: faith and love. Way to go Mrs. Barbara Joe-Williams, keep writing and we will keep reading.Irma ClarkAuthor of A Perfect Match"
5,Wonderful dream....,"Mining the Moon would seem like a wonderful idea. Free energy. The Moon can become, basically, a gas station. You land, refuel, grab a soft drink, a sandwich, and launch off into space. It would be a pit stop to Mars, Venus, deep space. Hydrogen, oxygen, water, all trapped on the Moon, ready for us to come and take it! This DVD shows how it could be done, how we could mine it, what can be done with the material found there!The problem is the DVD is from 2009 and, sad to say, is outdated. So the dream is already, in many ways, dead. The space programs that were developing the next generation of spaceships, reusable rockets, have been brought to a halt by the current President. NASA has been told it is going to Mars. What? Really? How? Without an American space station, or space shuttle, or Moon base? We WERE better off going back to the Moon because, no matter how you slice it, we HAVE to to explore the rest of space. Oh well, dream on."
2,all roads lead to lifetime adoption,"I was disappointed by this book. In general it had some good information,and a ton of internet links. The problem is, far too many of those links lead back to the author's adoption facilitation center, Lifetime Adoptions. They appear to be links to different services and companies, but if you look at the phone numbers and follow some links within those sites, back to Lifetime you go. A bit too much self promotion for me."
1,Two different titles for the SAME book???,"BUYER BEWARE: I purchased this book andAdopting Online: Your #1 Guide to a Successful Adoption(also by Mardie Caldwell) and to my surprise THEY WERE ACTUALLY THE SAME BOOK, PUBLISHED LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS APART UNDER DIFFERENT TITLES! Nowhere did it say that one was a minimally updated version of the other.While the information that these books contain is very good, I find it a very shady practice indeed to publish two books in this manner less than 4 months apart without informing potential buyers of the duplication. It has left me very wary of the author and the publisher. In fact, I would guess the US ISBN Agency would be interested in knowing these books are the same..."
1,You may lose the File you were working on,"I have Documents to Go installed on my Visor handheld. It works OK except for a major problem that you should be aware of. Maybe it is only me, but a number of times I have worked hours on a document and stored it. Then when I hotsych to my computer, the file is lost and does not show up on my PC either. I only get an indicator on my Visor saying that the file contents are not there. Imagine the frustration and wasted time. I am a proficient computer user. I write macros, manage a website, and am starting to learn PHP, but I haven't been able to resolve this problem. Perhaps there is a way around the problem but unless you are prepared to sink a lot of time figuring it out, be forewarned of this."
3,Not so great!,"Finally finished with our case of 12, so back looking for more filters, but not going to order this set again. The quality was really thin. Very affordable, but not a great buy when it comes to quality."
3,Good basic filter,"Since I seem to be changing filters every 3-4 weeks anyway, thought I'd try a less expensive option. These were definitely less expensive - seem to work well at filtering dog hair and big stuff. Not pleated, but not too thin for my expectations either."
3,Sweet and Sour,"The Sweet:The book is obviously well-researched, and the author's enthusiasm for the topic shines through. Each page is nicely designed and chock-full of colorful photos of vintage packages and ads. It's fun to flip through.The Sour:The amateurish writing style, poor editing and number of glaring typos detract from what could've been a real treat. Even a proofreader would have made a world of difference."
2,Candy:The Sweet History,This book has a great cover and wonderful pictures but it seems to have missed both the editor and proofreader. The writing is also mediocre. It's nice to look at but very hard to read especially when one is attempting to make corrections during the reading process.
2,Looks Better Than It Is,"The cutting board is very attractive, but within a couple of weeks of its arrival and use, it developed cracks and became slightly warped. It's still useable, but I'm disappointed that something at this price does not seem able to stand up well to normal use."
5,Another Great Apple Product,Delighted with them. An Franciscan Apple collectors delight. Nice air tight lids.
1,Not very chip resistant,"I purchased these to keep on my counter and house my coffee. I used them daily and they soon looked terrible! The paint on the lids has worn off almost all the way around the edge, and there are chips off the enamel portion as well. I do not recommend these for anyone who is actually going to use them."
5,FLORANGEL--COMO TE OLVIDO?,"ESTE ALBUM DEBE SER UNOS DE LOS MAS MOVIDOS EN EL GENERO DE MERENGUERAS..CANCIONES COMO--A MEDIO TIEMPO NO!EL LOBO Y DEVUELVEME MI CORAZON,SON RAZONES PARA COMPRAR ESTE SU PRIMER PROD.DISCOGRAFICA--FLORANGEL--ES Y SERA UNAS DE LAS MEJORES EN EL MERENGUE!

2,"Nice looking, comfortable, but not protective at all.","For real sparring, this has no nose or jaw protection, it will only protect you from hooks thats about it, do not recommend it."
1,Can't be used for sparring,This headgear offers little protection and fits poorly. If you can't use it to spar there's really no use for the gear.
1,Crappy headgear,"Wish I had asked my coach BEFORE buying this. Most people who use and buy this product will tell you it is crap. Too light, slips on your head easily, and not flexible enough. Spend $30 more and get a nice Rival headgear instead."
4,Lights Out,"Straps work fine and hold up, fits nice and snug. and saved the noggin many times, would buy again when mine wears out"
4,I luv it,This headgear is hot and i mean in a good way its comfortable and looks good only thing is the forehead has swade which means it could start stinking if you don't put like a cloth there.[...]
4,toddler friendly use of the light,"I bought this doll for my one and a half year old who has discovered Bob the Builder recently. It is the only stuffed Bob I could find and my little guy really likes it. Bob carries a flashlight that is easy to operate even for a toddler, all he has to do is squeeze the sides of the flashlight to make it come on. He likes the soft orange glow of the light and the doll is just the right size for little ones. The only thing I dislike about the light is that it does not have a switch, once you let go of the sides of the flashlight the light goes out. Also, the batteries cannot be replaced once they die, there is no way to get to the batteries without cutting the fabric of the flashlight open(unless there is a trick to it that I haven't figured out yet).Nonetheless, my son likes his stuffed Bob and takes it out with him quite often."
5,Bob the Builder-12 in. Soft & Cuddly Nighlight,"My 2 1/2 year old son flipped when he opened this for Christmas! He sleeps with Bob every night and loves that the light is easy enough for him to do by himself- no buttons to mess with, just a gentle squeeze and it lights up. He carries Bob with him everywhere! This was definitely money well spent."
3,A bit heavy but works..,"This thing is heavy, not sure why Gibraltar used a 3/4 pipe to build this instead of the regular size used by toms and cymbal stands, this thing only works on a large Cymbal stand (those used for heavy rides)and does not fit normal tom clamps. Bongoes are not that heavy guys!!"
4,Does the job well,"A good solid holder. A bit time-consuming to mount the drums, and it would have been nicer if it tilted as far back as it does forward, and post is longer than it needs to be (say if you wanted to use it to play bongos by hand from a typical chair). Fits my old Tama tripod just fine. Satisfied with value for price."
5,Great introductory,"I purchased this book to teach myself seismology. It is a great introductory, so it's appropriately named. Shearer writes clearly and concisely, and the book is mostly self-contained."
2,For the more serious student,"While I believe the lessons would eventually teach Czech well, they seemed to be designed for someone sitting down at a desk and repeatedly replaying the CD's while following along the written text. Having said that, I did found the book material excellent for a vocabulary reference. The verbal CD conversations were difficult to follow as a learning device, however, listening and reading at the same time did give a good opportunity to learn how to speak the Czech written words with some accuracy. I did use the text in the Czech Republic while we were there and it was helpful as a reference. I never made it through the CD's to the end. This to me was not a program that I could learn in only a couple of weeks, but it is a good foundation for someone who really needs to learn Czech over a period of time. The two stars are for the intensity needed to learn from the program, not the quality of what is provided."
2,Not for tourists,"I purchased this book for an upcoming trip to Prague, in hopes of at least learning a little of the language. Unfortunately, all I came away with was ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""hello."" The book starts out doing a good job of outlining how to pronounce Czech words and how different accents change the sounds, however, the units stray increasingly far from anything useful to a tourist (including a conversation in which the 2 characters are having a domestic dispute). The book does include the numbers and other basics, but the cd does not cover their pronunciation.This may be a good supplemental cd if you are already in a Czech class, because it gives a good feel for the pronunciation of the language as a whole, however it is not useful for a tourist who needs to learn things such as how to ask how much something costs or needs to be able to read a menu. Thankfully everything in Prague was in English as well, but I would have liked to learn a bit more of the language before going."
2,Take only with supplement,"I find this book a churning chaos. I only recommend using it in conjunction with something like Czech: An Essential Grammar. Without something like that you'll be flipping around crazily every time you use this book. You'll be flipping around anyway of course, but much more efficiently if you have another book. I'm sure there's a logic to the book's organization but it doesn't work for me. The appendices at the back do not make up the deficit. !But! I haven't found anything definitely better.Czech: An Essential Grammar (Essential Grammars)"
2,worthless,"This ""log"" is very small and very cheaply made. The space allocated to describe the purpose of your travel is way too small. I can't believe that this documentation would be adequate for an IRS audit. I sent mine back and just use an 8 x 11 notebook where I have all the space I need. Don't waste your money on this item."
3,too long,"At half the length this would be a dandy group biography. But we see too much of the Lunar Men away from each other, too much of their children, too much domesticity. This drags after a while, and obscures the main point of interest: the men themselves, as a group and a fellowship."
3,An Ambitious work,"Jenny Uglow took on a very ambtious project in writing, ""The Lunar Men: Five Friends Whose Curiousity Changed the World."" She showcases the ambition, innovative spirit, and willingness to take risks that drove the Industrial Revolution by examining the Lunar Society, focusing specifically on some of the more personable members. Although this book was interesting, it was also quite lengthy, and for someone who does not feel the same passion for the topic it may be a bit much. This work is a valuable source of information and I would recommend it as a fresh approach to a subject that is worth examining for someone who would like to read about the more human aspect of the Industiral Revolution."
5,The Lunar Men,A fascinating story about entrepreneurs who discussed their ideas together and hence developed objects and machines that have changed our world today.
3,Herzog thriller won't shake you up too badly.,"A scientist in New England becomes convinced that an earthquake in the area is imminent. No one believes him of course, but fans of the disaster genre should know that that is one bad call to make. A fun read, but nothing special."
5,Services Targeted for Children,"This guide recognizes the fact that many libraries have no children's specialist and offers practical tips on how any library can provide basic children's services. The author covers all aspects of children's services, including storytime, other types of programming, collection development, booktalks, displays, and more. She also describes basic differences between serving children and serving adults. (summary by South TX Library System)This covers the ever-so-important services for children in your community. Although many libraries don't have the budget for a specialist, there are ways to squeeze in the necessary activities and services. Make it easier for yourself, by getting this book to find the way to do it."
5,I love this series,As usual this board book has wonderful illustrations. The graphics are beatiful. The story is cute. I really enjoy reading this with my son. In each book there is one hidden pokemon to find.
2,The PC version is much better,"Unless I'm mistaken, this version of Duke Nukem (3D) came out a couple of years after the PC version, yet the graphics and animation were much better playing this on my old 486dx2-66 at the lowest graphic mode settings. This PSX version is really ugly, and I was very disappointed because I was looking forward to having fun playing Duke Nukem again after all these years. Do yourself a favor and play this on the PC instead -- not only are the PC graphics much better (even on a low-end Pentium) but the controls are much better too (keyboard beats joystick for 1st person shooters any day)."
3,Smoke'm if U Got'em!,"I don't see how any body can't like this game. I remember when the playstation first came out and this was the first game i got. I thought it was the coolest game ever, and i still think it's my favorite playstaion game. And im 17 now. It's a classic duke nukem game, i know the graphics aren't the best and a lot of the stuff is cheesy about the game, but regardless it's fun to play, and is easily a classic. :)"
1,"if you have a PC or a MAC, dont buy the psx version","I have this particular game for both PC and PSX, and the PC version is much better. The playstation version is choppy and has very akward controls. I truely believe that for 98 cents its a good buy, but the most fun idea would be to throw it out of a car bus ect. instead of actually playing it. for a good FPS get The World Is Not Enough, or Quake II"
1,Terribly Disapointing,I've been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time. I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes. Total Meltdown is the most frustrating FPS I have ever played. The speed is so fast it is hard to move. Looking up and down is a chore.You use L1 and L2 to look up and down. Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible. Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible. Sound is bad as well. The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebook(it is funny). The only semi-detailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations. Even the cutscenes are bad. Please try to avoid this game and save some cash.
2,Lower quality than expected,"The cervical pillow's foam is really soft and just crushes easily and the cloth cover is really cheap fabric that is way too big. I guess you get what you pay for, but I ended up buying a much higher quality pillow and throwing this one away the same week I got it. I give it two stars. One star for it being a pillow and the second star for it being round."
2,Really more for lumbar area but...,"This pillow is too thick for cervical area unless you have a really long ""Cinderella""neck or something like that. Plus the foam is not ""dense"" even if used for the lumbar area.I would have kept the item if it was supportive enough for my lower back but it is not. I will be returning the item. Its a shame-I did like the cover that comes with the pillow."
5,Cervical pillow is firm support for kneck,Once I did recieve this pillow I like it. I had to trace the shipping of it due to the time from purchase. But after I contacted amazon the pillow was here ASAP. Nice supportive pillow. I recommend this pillow.
1,Product disclosure misleading,"I am quite impressed with the quality of the product, but the description makes it sound like there are going to be both front and back floor mats in the package...WRONG!!! This is the front seat only. Buyer beware. I have had NOTHING but luck with Amazon, so I am not going to blame them, the box that the mats were in even showed that it had 4 mats (both front and back), but in the very tiny disclosure at the bottom, you will see that there are 2 different product numbers. VERY misleading.They do fit my 2008 Audi A4 perfect, so i am going to keep them, but am VERY disappointed in not having back seat as well.Amazon, it would help if you were more clear in your description!!!!"
2,Consider only if you can't find an alternative,"I teach Sex Education to 5th graders, and I purchased this video to see if I could substitute it for the very well done but now out-of-production ""What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up."" I was extremely disappointed. ""The Birds, the Bees, and Me for Girls"" mostly consisted of a teenager explaining puberty and sex, with only a few (not very helpful) cartoon illustrations. My students would easily tune out the narrator since the topic isn't a comfortable one to begin with and the camera focuses on her face and nothing else for long periods of time.If you can't find anything else, this does touch on many important topics (intro to puberty, sex, and responsibility) and is better than nothing. However, it fails to get into the details of menstruation, which is an extremely important topic for girls. If you can get your hands on ""What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up,"" you'll be much happier despite the out-of-date hair styles!"
4,very very good - 4 or 5 star rating,this recording is really good.most of the pieces are near great.very well played and manufactured.comes with a good booklet.chabrier ranks as a composer.I would recommend this cd.
5,A Must Have,"Awesome-it's not just a good read, it's a learning experience, an added reflection I can add to my own life....."
1,NEVER by Memorex!,I bought a 25 pack of these disks and 6 of them (so far) have fatal errors on the discs. There is nothing so frustrating as to record a show on a disc than to find that the video stops/stutters and then completely freezes so that you can't view the rest of the content. I am going to go to Memorex support and I expect them to make this good with a refund or replacement. I hope they change their manufacturing processes so that their products are reliable or they will NEVER get a return customer and they will be the next business you will see filling chapter 7!
2,Typical Memorex,"I have owned a Memorex DVD player, which fell apart within one year, and I've had numerous problems with Memorex recordable DVDs. Based on my experiences I think the company should have a new advertising slogan;""Is it crap, or is it Memorex?"""
4,It just works,"Nothing special about it, except that it just works in my NEC laptop burner and in my Philips DVD. I am satisfied."
4,False promises,"The product is good. However, the ""what's in the box"" category told me that there will be a two piece case which never arrived. Shipping was prompt but only the product was delivered and not everything that the description promised."
1,Bad Quality,"I just purchased these and all are coasters. I have had good results with Memorex media before (though not the DVD +RW) but I'll stick to TDK, Sony or Fujifilm in future. Sony makes Sony; not sure who makes the TDK; Fujifilm is Ricoh; and this batch of Memorex seem to have been made by Infodisc - obviously a manufacturer to avoid. Anyone interested in doing their own check can Google DVD identifier."
1,Depends on your DVD writer,It definitely is not for LG DVD writers. I have an external firewire model and more than half of these have gone corrupt some time after actually being written to succesfully ! From other reviews here I would say you should check with your vendor for compatibility with this media. Some seem quite satisfied.
4,Good but slow,I have almost used 15 of the 25 DVDs and didnt get any problem but only thing is that it is very slow. It took me a very long time to take backup of my data to these DVDs. My stuff was done without any problem though.
2,MOMOREX Disks,"Had trouble formatting, copying and or erasing some. I googled the brand after and found I was not alone. Won't buy MEMOREX again!"
1,Very unhappy with this purchase,I bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site. I was very pleased with the purchase then. I didn't have one problem with the discs.I bought another pack recently and I've been using the pack I just bought. All of the discs are messing up for me. I can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you. I wish I could send these discs back and get a refund. This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex. I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers. I guess I was wrong. And apparently you get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the good price. You'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn't even be worth using as a frisbee. Find another brand to use and avoid this brand.
1,Horrible quality,I was deeply disappointed for buying stuff from Memorex. Not a single DVD was usable in the pack. Never gonna buy anything from Memorex!!
1,Very unhappy with purchase,"I just bought this set of disks, against what I read from the other reviewers in the page. Was I wrong not to listen!!Out of the 8 first DVDs I tried to burn only 1 has been successful. All the other ones game me some error and interrupted burning in the middle.Save yourself some money! Do NOT buy this product!!! It is of HORRIBLE quality!!"
2,Works only in newer machines!,"Make sure your player is recent, 1 year to 1 1/2.It will not play in older ones!"
1,Memorex DVD+RW,The product was poorly packed and tore open. As a result the disks I have tested will not work.
1,Memorex DVD+RW disks used to be good,"I have been using Memorex DVD+RW disks for a few years. Up until this particular version with the little stars on the disks I had good results.These more recent disks might burn once or twice. After that, forget it!! Burn failures galore.Use another brand."
1,Memorex and Panasonic strike out!,"My new Panasonic DVD player cannot read, write, format or play any of these Memorex discs. Panasonic responds that they ""have problems with Memorex, but Panasonic, Sony or TDK disks work just fine""???? I have hundreds of recordings on Memorex and that leaves me with these two outfits pointing at each other.JW"
4,Avoid at all cost. Click away while you still can!,"Ordered it in March, thinking that it mught be a Ricohjpnw11 but dissappointed to find out that it's actually a Infodisca10.I finally got to using and testing them and found the exact same problem as some of the posters here.AVOID AT ALL COSTS! FOUND MANY COASTERS. 8 out of 25. :(It did not work with my BenQ 1640 or my LG DVD-RAM drive properly. And they are bought late last year!The star rating I gave is in error. Amazon refuse to let me edit it."
2,Lots of Coasters,"When these discs work, they work well. However, there are an awful lot of coasters in this bundle."
2,Please Don't Waste Your Money,I purchased two 25-packs because of lower prices and free shipment but it was a bad mistake. I had too many coasters from the 1st pack. I am about 50% with the 2nd pack which has been trouble-free so far.After some research my next purchase will be Verbatim - based on positive customer feedback.
1,Poor quality,"I bought these recently, attempted to burn three seperate DVD+RWs and all three came out with burn errors. Either I also got a bad batch, or these DVD+RWs are very poor quality, and likely why they're so cheap."
1,Total Dissapointment,"Hi dudes, no products have ever got me as frustrated but this memorex DVD is the first to make me. Waited for a few weeks for these junk to come to me which gives me problems writing, reading or even formatting. Try googling to see if there is any problem with this product.... you will find loads of them. The next day I bought another set of DVD (imation) from the popular store and it works like a charm. An advice to you guys, never ever buy this product."
1,These DVD's would not record,I bought these MEMOREX DVD-RW 25 pack and they will not record on my machine. I bought the exact same product at Walmart and they do record. Unfortunately I bought them in May so I am stuck with them. I had to mark one star to make this go through but this pack gets no stars from me.Memorex 4x DVD+RW 25-Pack Spindle
1,Don't buy these,"So far, the first six out of the spindle do not work. After hours of thinking that my DVD burner on my Imac was messed up, I tried another brand and no problem. These things are junk. Maybe they will work on a PC, but don't buy them for a MAC."
2,Good Price but Many Burning Problems,This item has proved to be very problematic. Half of the disks burned so far have become coasters!I 've been using Memorex +RW and Maxell +R for a long time and didn't have all these problems.Either I got a bad batch or the quality is very poor.
1,Must have a bad spindle,"I have used Memorex DVD+RW disks before (purchased in a 10 pack) and they were reliable. However, this 25 pack has given me many problems; they have many write errors and won't erase correctly. Few, if any, are working as expected and thus I can't trust them for any backup work. MS Windows Live One Care won't accept them at all. I noticed that the disk id is different for these (different manufacturer) than the 10 packs I purchased several years ago."
2,Quality control?,"The second disc in this package was faulty, which I did not discover until I spent two hours recording a movie. There was what appeared to be a half inch bare spot on the outer edge of the dvd+r. Not what I expected from Memorex which purports to be the best.I have switched to Maxell."
4,Some Problems with Memorex 25 pack DVD +RW,"I've purchased at least eight, 25 packs with spotty results. Some of the disks indicate ""disk dirty"" when I finalize them, even so, they do play on a different DVD player and brand(one that they were not recorded on). Recently the last batch of 25 disks however, had two disks that wouldn't even format, and I had to toss them out. Even so the price is still quite good! Several of the bad disks have obvious visual problems when viewed carefully from the recording side. The question I have, is why can't Memorex's quality control catch these problems. It should be easy with an optical scanning system!"
4,Good buy but 10% failure rate is not good,Bought 2 spindles @ 25 each and right from the start had trouble formatting several of them. Finally got them all formatted but ran into disk failures with no apparent cause. 5 out of the 50 not to mention time wasted elimating commercials from a recorded disk! I had bought Sony in the past and found them to be very good with no issues of failure rates of other brands used.
2,Malfunctioned stock?,"I ordered a 25 pack of these DVD+RWs and there seems to be a bad sector or something about 2/3 of the way through the DVD. I have tried to burn several different disks (including full erasing and reburning some of them multiple times), and any data past about the 3 GB mark (out of 4.7 GB) is corrupted and cannot be read. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed about this. The first 3 gigs works fine though..."
2,"Great idea, but poor performance",I assumed these DVD's would get longer recording time but they crapped out on me when i needed them most. A few of the DVD's were ruined and unusuable. The price was great and they will work fine for recording a sitcom or some funny snl skit (if there ever is one again) but i would not use them to record anything of length. They are very unreliable as they get near the max recording time. I would choose another DVD for your important recording.
4,Highly Recommended,"If you have read Lerner's previous book, ""Forest for the Trees"", you already know she can handle any thorny issue with good-natured humor. In this book, she deals with her painful past, her issue of over-eating, and of suicide, and she also manages to write about these uncomfortable subjects with aplomb. It would be easy for these subjects to turn into melodramatic telling of episodes, and grandiose claims of healing, but Lerner tells her story with a light poise. She's a self-effacing writer, who writes for the sake of her reader, and not for her own service. This book will help and inspire many people with similar problems."
2,Disappointing,"Overall, this book was very disappointing. Yes, the author's story is quite poignant, as she recants her struggles in very good detail. It even has its funny parts. The problem is what the book does not do. Honestly, as a person who has had trouble with eating from time to time, I was hoping this book would give me some insight about why people become addicted to food, and some tips on how to overcome it. Unfortunately, I am now much more aware of the author's early sex life than I am of the nature of food addictions.I suppose that one could, after reading this book, come away feeling better about themselves, knowing that they are not alone or others may have it worse, but most readers of this book would probably know that already."
2,Easy read but had some beefs with the content,"First of all, had I known that the author was an atheist, I would not have purchased this book. Although she is entitled to her opinions, I found her use of God's name with a small ""g"" very offensive. She even capitalized ""Higher Power"". I did, however, see her slip (or the editors) and capitalize the word God on p 157. Besides this annoyance, I found the story quite interesting. Because I work in the social services field, it was very interesting to hear about her years in therapy."
2,Lacking in many ways,Definitely one of the weaker memoirs in a long time. She could use some help with her writing.
3,LESS TO DO WITH FOOD...MORE TO DO WITH LOATHING...,"This is a book that gets off to a promising start, as the author discusses her lifelong compulsion to over-indulge with respect to food and the self-loathing that accompanied her compulsion. While the author writes well, the book begins to head south as the author's self-absorption begins to cast a pall. She is a woman whose weight begins to dominate her every thought and her entire life. Who would have thought that one hundred and seventy pounds of avoirdupois on a five foot two frame would be so tragic for someone?When the author is diagnosed with a mental disorder that simply requires her to medicate herself, the reader is relieved that the author's ordeal is over, as is that of the reader. While the author writes with a certain self-deprecating sense of humor, it is not enough to disguise the self-absorption throughout. Therein lies her true gluttony."
2,Left me a bit offended...,"The first half of the book kept me interested and wondering what would happen next but by the second half I was just trying to get through the book and finish. I know eating disorders are complex and personal but I have to say I was kind of offended that the exact weight in pounds that Betsey was (176) that landed her in a mental hospital, is my exact weight now! I think I am okay even though society seems to tell me otherwise. I would like to lose some weight but I found it difficult to understand her total emphasis on weight. I would think the drug use, casual sex and having an abortion would be more damaging. This writer has lots of promise but I can't recommend this book."
1,The worst sort of self-indulgence,"I was excited to find this book, especially after reading another literary agent's (Frances Kuffel's) fine work about fatness. But finding myself 40 or so pages into the book, I realized (1) the author was never truly fat; (2) the author is not truly crazy or suicidal; and most importantly (3) the author is not an engaging writer.Shame on the publisher for putting out this pathetic, self-indulgent little piece. And my sympathy for anyone who paid full price for it."
2,"A quick read, but not too insightful","I was hooked at the start of this book, when Lerner described her relationship with food without self-pity or melodrama. But once her mental illness came into play, I felt like this was just another depression book about how great medication can be. I think many women can relate to Lerner's obsession with and relationship to food and eating, but few have been diagnosed as manic-depressive, as she was."
5,Great book,This is a great book. I found it full of helpful information and very thorough. It seems Dr. Schwartz has covered everything. The text and format is easily readable and it is illustrated with very cute pictures. I would highly recommend this book.
2,Ugh,"A six year sufferer of bulimia myself, I still cannot fathom the selfishness of this woman. Not only did she not care about herself, she couldn't give two sh*ts abut the lives of her unborn children. When you can't manage to stop purging even for the LIFE of a child, then you don't deserve them. The only reason I can give this two stars is because she had the courage to write such a terrible, short memoir about nearly-murderous activities.The book is written like someone inflating some things for extra attention, and desperately needs an editor. I can't tell you how many times there are two sentences in a row saying the same thing (such as ""I had gained five pounds. They said I gained five pounds at the doctor on Oct 5"" or something like that)."
2,Makes me wanna be Straight!,"Great titles, HORRIBLE mixes. Give me the pure and uncomplicated music, the way it was written and performed. I felt totally ripped off. Skip it, boys!"
2,A depressing collection,"I had to read a bunch of stories out of this book for a college course. Most of the stories are super depressing. I guess that reflects on American society, but I can only take so much. It's like watching the news, but more literary."
4,very interesting!,"The whole concept of Kelly Howell's series is based on a lot of research that is very popular in the last few years. I use High Focus whenever I need utmost concentration prior to reading textbooks for medical school and to confirm recall after each session. Users should not be too comfortable (like be in bed) when they use the tapes coz sleep is a close possibility. The rhythm and the music in itself is very soothing and when I come out of each session, I get so much clarity and focus that I am ready to read just about anything!"
4,this works,The whitenoise in this cd works. i am an MBA student who needs to focus a lot on the activities at hand. I found this CD very helpful and strongly recommend it.
4,"Dreamland, here I come!","This is a very good brain wave massage for me. It's not so much of Kelly Howell's talking, (which I happen to like), but this is the second best thing for how it relaxes me and massages my brain enough for me to relax and go to sleep. thank-you for yet another excellet CD from the Brain Sync audios!"
1,The Sound of Crickets,"If you love the sound of crickets chirping, then buy this. However, if you find the sound of crickets annoying, do not purchase this cd!"
5,It's a beauty if you have the counter space,"This block is a beautiful addition to my kitchen, but it weighs about 25 pounds, so it stays on the counter top. If you are short on counter space, be prepared to build up your biceps! It's a bear to put away.You should be aware that this block is not reversible, as you can use only one side for chopping."
3,Not too bad.,This movie wasn't too bad for a low budget horror movie. The fight scenes needed more work though.
5,cyclorama,very nice thanks c. if you go to atlanta be sure and take in the cyclorama and the zoo also
2,pet stroller,Made well and looks pretty. The problem is the latch in front will not keep any animal in.
1,Protesting in the us is childish,"We live in wonderful times. Why publishers continue to publish this kind of trash is beyond me. People who haven't resolved their own problems seem to have no outlet but to hide behind politics... Being cruelly perhaps, ignored as children how many protesters have we seen with tears and emotion now stand up for cause X and scream. WeWill be heard! Its mommy and daddy's fault and you dear childish protester was honestly hurt. The resolution is to attend and heal your pain...not pretend it is an important political issue. Nope u aren't changing the world...ur pain wil just continue if u try and hide it behind slogans like the cover of this farce.I always fear that some publisher chose this trash to publish over perhaps the next Dostoyevsky whom he rejected."
1,less than 0 really,Susie Stalin aka Medea (child killer) Benjamin is a really disturbed maniac and should be ashamed of herself. This woman is devoid of any intellectual honesty. A puppet of the Left she disgraces peace. As anyone know there is no peace without justice. Apparently Ms Benjamin would rather live enslaved in a Communist state than as a free individual.The best I can say about this book is it's comic in its infantile brashness.
3,Predictable,"There are no major points for this book. I quickly figured out who the human ""villain"" in this story was, and the climax was a major drag. It keeps the mystery alive, but it comes across as nothing more than explaining what certain symbols mean. It has to be a lighter version of HALLOWEEN 6, which talked about some of the same symbols. I have the best idea for the final Blair Witch movie. Have all serial killers from the movies battle it out to see who will be the ruler of the woods in Burkittsville."
4,"Good Cookbook, but some experience required","This is my staple Thai cookbook, that I got from a friend who lived in Thailand for many years. He said that the recipes, were the best of all the books he looked at as far as duplicating Thai food. We worked our way through the book over several evenings and dinner parties as he taught me to cook Thai. That said, the first thing I learned was selection of ingredients. The cookbook covers this a bit, but not enough for someone new to Thai. Secondly, there were several typos that were misleading and several of the cooking times were absurdly short-- like potatoes going fully cooked in 7 minutes, it simply won't happen in a frying pan. So, while the cookbook has authentic recipes that are delicious (if you like Thai), it does have it's shortcomings, hence 4 stars. That said, I'm not giving up my copy. It has a special place on my cooking shelf."
2,"Beautiful pictures, unauthentic food, apparently","I showed this book to my Thai boyfriend who poo-pooed many of the recipes in this book, claiming lack of authenticity. His words were ""this is fake"". I can't get a hold of many ingredients, I lack kitchen space to prepare many of these dishes, and looking at the ingredient lists, they'd cost me a fortune in money and time if I could get the ingredients. I know so little about Thai cooking and the flavors used, substitution is beyond me.The pictures are gorgeous, though."
4,A well paced mystery in the Florida sun,"Williams gives a good picture of the seemy underside of South Florida politics, journalism and real estate in this murder mystery. The story plays out like a solid mystery movie with plenty of twists and turns, and of course, the big surprise ending. The novel moves along well and keeps you interested until the end. Overall, a good read."
3,"It's a neat deal, but question its accuracy","Don't know how accurate the speed really is. The pitcher and catcher need to be a specified distance apart, otherwise the reading will be inaccurate for sure. At times the reading will be identical between consecutive pitches that were thrown with different arm strength, making one question its validity or if it needs to be reset or something. On the positive side, it is a neat thing for a young kid who dreams of being a pitcher to challenge himself to throw hard and with control. (just let him believe the numbers are close to accurate and go on!)"
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this for my son for Christmas. He was very excited when he opened it. However, it doesn't work! We have tried everything, even new batteries. Don't waste your money!"
1,Digital Speed Sensing Ball,It never worked! Gave it as a gift to my son's friend. They informed us it never worked. Planning to return it.
1,Terrible,does not work. bought it for a birthday present for my little brother and it stopped working the same day he got it. it always reads the same speed.
2,"Not advertised differential. Only 20 psi, Not 30 psi.","This switch is advertised as a compressor switch with factory settions of OFF at 125 and on at 95 psi, which is standard and is a 30 psi differential. My new switch is getting only a 20 psi differential. I can adjust it up and down, but I can't adjust the differential. A mere 20 psi differential means the compressor comes on and off more often then I wanted it to. I'll investiage and see if others are experiencing this and update if this is user error."
5,Wonderfully re-recorded....,"These re-recordings of Jo's hits are first rate. I'm usually not a fan of re-recordings but there have been times when it worked. Another example is ""The Hits of Kay Starr"". She re-recorded 12 of her hits in that glorious Capitol stereo sound of the early sixties and it was magnificent. That one, however, has never been released on cd.This one of Jo's has been around for a while and it was hard to find but Amazon has 3 copies now from different sellers. Jo's voice in stereo sounds wonderful and Paul Weston's arrangements compliment her voice beautifully. Pick it up. You won't be dissapointed."
4,chance meeting between two record players and a wind tunnel,"Although not the classic that 'Endless Humiliation' is, this runs a close second. The mood here is somewhat brooding and ambient with what sounds like an amplified needle scraping across the record every now and then, just for fun. Two long tracks of this, so grab a blanket and cuddle up to the one you love while Gero destroys these helpless 45sbtw ~ if anyone has a copy of 'Hotel Ultra' they'd be willing to sell me, get in touch ! ! ! :-)"
5,"Good, but not great","This was one of the better mysteries. Claudia gets a job helping the granddaughter of Grandmother Madden prepare to sell the house. Claudia notices that some of the paintings disappear, and some weird art dealers are yhanging around. Also Grandmother Madden supposedly dystroyed most of her work. But Claudia doesn't think so. She thinks there still around. And the only clue she has is a mysterious Japanese woman painting"
2,Not that good,This book wasnt very interesting for me as It mostly talk about art it was also hard to follow. I like doing art but the theory side of it is boring. It talks about that in this book. Also theres not much baby sitting in this book and it was more about art than it was about an actual mystery. I think Ann could of wrote this book a bit better.
4,"A chick book, but for men too.","I got this book thinking that it was going to a book that I would read with my wife, but she would enjoy it more that I would. What I found was that I enjoyed reading how God had touch the lives of all the people in the book as much has my wife. I am a fact and figures kind of man, but there is no better way to teach than by example."
2,average content,this book doesnt contain the amount of information that you might expect.If you have no idea about apreggios then you will learn somthing from it however if you already have a basic knowledge of arpeggios this book wont be very helpful.it does howveer have a few nice superimposing ideas but nothing spectacular.overall i was dissapointed with the book and could of obtained the information from the web . chord arpeggio shapes arnt hard to come across.the book includes a cd but there are no backing tracks to practice your arpeggios
3,autobiography of a spiritually incorrect mystic,Nice book only half is about is life which is suprising as he seemed to talk and do alot.
1,SAME OLD,"ALTHOUGH I WAS AWARE THAT THE BOOK WAS NOT AN ACTUAL "" AUTOBIOGRAPHY "" , I AM STILL DISAPPOINTED IN THE CONSTANT VAGUE RAMBLINGS AND TIRED INSIGHTS THAT THE AUTHOR EVOKES . THERE IS A LIMIT TO WHAT THE PRINTED WORD CAN DO , AND THIS BOOK DOES VERY LITTLE . I AM AWARE THAT THE FELLOW HAS PRODUCED SOME WITTY , AND AT TIMES STIMULATING IDEAS , AND HAS THE OCCASIONAL ABILITY TO EXPRESS CONCEPTS THAT MIGHT CREATE AN INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY , BUT THIS IS WEAK . GAVE IT A 1 STAR FOR THE INTERESTING TITLE ........"
5,Must for Osho lovers,"Although this is not an autobiography in true sense (Osho never wrote his autobiography). This book is a collection from several of his talks that fit like an autobiography. If one is a critic of his views, then he will find a lot of stuff that can be criticised. On the other hand if one is a believer, he/she will get ample dose of Osho's wonderful message.I finished the book in about 6 hours. Once I started reading, I just could not stop myself. I highly recommend this book for all readers. When reading anything by Osho one has to be prepared to face the truth. Osho has a ""in your face"" approach to everything, and that's what makes him great."
4,worth it for the pictures alone,"the osho bondage photos are always so satisfying.a bit rambly, though.but glad to have it."
5,Amazing,"I read this book twice. Even that he is not an amazing writer (because all this book is a recompilation of many talk he gave) the story is really funny and creative. I have always admired him and how he saw life when he was alive, I do recommend to read this book to everyone, not because I agree with him, just because I think he had an amazing happy life."
2,Official guides are never the best,These official guides are never the best but are usually where people start on finding out about college exams. The best book I found can be downloaded off the getyourcollegedegree website and not only gives information on CLEP but also how to get almost your entire degree using exams. I have accumulated over 63 credits myself.
1,WARNING!! Don't waste your money,"I took nearly all of the practice tests in this book, and it did me no good; there are no helpful guides explaining how to score well. There is absolutely no way to know how well one does on the individual tests, as there are no scoring guides. College Board has said that they don't have scoring guides for the practice tests, which illustrates the fact that this book is nothing more than a (...)"
2,Not A Very Informative Study Guide,"This book is just a lot of questions with answers. No reference material, no how, what, where, when, or why, anywhere in this book. If you plan on taking the C.L.E.P. Test find some resource material and study that. If you just want to know the format and what the test will look like then this may be a good book for you."
5,Good Srudy Guide,A great tool to test out of classes. Tuition is getting to high not to take some initiative.
1,A rip-off,This book rips off Tolkien's name. It is got up to look as if it is writen BY Tolkien. In fact it is a collection of largely poorly-written and factually incorrect articles by minor academics.
3,Moonraker Mutiny,"Read this book in Paperback in 1977 while working night watch as a Radio Telegraph Operator in the Coast Guard. I really enjoyed reading about what it might be like to ship on a Foreign ""Flag of Convience"" ship. The Ship Moonraker was doomed when it Sailed from Fremantle, Aus. for Mauritus Island with general Cargo. The Skipper an alcoholic and had fallen from grace in the British Maritime due to abandoning a ship that was still seaworthy in the past. After losing the Main Engine and Generator in a Cyclone and most of the Crew leaves the ship in a life boat, the Capt. is left with his daughter, the stewart, and a passage worker and hopes to redeem himself with the British Maritime buy trying to rig up sails on the cargo mast and sail the ship to port. When I signed on a Singapore Flag Freighter 2 years later, I found that some of these foreign flag ships could be in pretty shabby condition, but I got the radio room organized and it was in good shape before I left the ship."
3,Not for big bottoms,"I read the sizing chart carefully before I bought this jacket. I was really worried about the price but the lifetime guarantee sold me. When I got the jacket (in blue), it was gorgeous. Exactly what I wanted. It fit perfectly...and then I tried to zip it up. Though it says it's fit for a womanly shape, it definitely doesn't include women with big bottoms. The jacket, even though it was in the right size, did not leave very much room for my butt and so it was tight in that area. I returned it and it has taken much longer than expected to get a refund."
1,movie badness,"this was an absolutely horrible movie, bad acting, I fast forwarded through some of it, there is this woman who keeps blood on her face for most of the movie, its distracting, dont waste your money!"
3,They Got Fed off of this movie,"The Feeding is the greatest example of Low quality special effects and sometimes silliness and blury effects. The sad reality is that when a director and producers decide to make what they think is a good werewolf movie, it seem to me they just get further and further away from the werewolf transformations. When Rick Baker and Rob Bottin did there werewolf movie,An American Werewolf In London and The Howling,they did not have alot of money,and of course the 2 movies we're low budget films way back in 1980. The big differents between the 2 werewolf movies and The Feeding is that these we're low budget films and the special effects we're completely excellent. The Feeding is a low budget film and there is not one werewolf transformation effects at all in the film, not even any optical effects. But I will give the director of the film a little credit who also worte the film as well. The writing was different and kinda unique and really a surprise to me."
2,Very familiar monster in the woods,"Hi, I caught this film the other night on the Sci-fi channel.Not really the worst monster movie I have ever seen, but what shocked me were it's similarites to another low budget monster in the woods movie called ""The Haw Ridge Devil"" made in 2003. Even the monsters, in the case of ""The Feeding"" a giant werewolf, looked alot alike. Of course after a while all these monster on the loose movies begin to look the same. Still compared to other movies on the Sci-fi Channel it was more entertaining than most."
4,Using as Text,"Wonderful book! We're currently using it in our beginning studio class. Sullivan has a wonderful sense of humor, good skill building exercises and really good graphics. Highly recommend it for anyone wanting how to draw the landscape."
4,Good book considering how much time has passed.,"Considering that when I tried to order manuals for my used '76 Honda from Honda's supplier they sent me Xerox copies for the same price as this manual, I think its a good deal. The book covers exactly the same information, though not in as much detail as would be needed for a shop. But its a great tool for someone trying to maintain an old bike that a shop won't service. The intro can be a bit simplistic in explaining how a four-cylinder engine works, but the tune-up and routine maintenance information is great!"
5,two thumbs up,"This book is a great collection of archival scientific references for survival of microorganisms in many, many different environments and matrices. It includes sterilization resistance data as well. Somebody stole my copy and now this book is out of print and I can't find a copy or get the publisher to reprint. Contact me if you have a copy you want to part with."
3,Want to make customers surprised?,"Do you know how to make customers always happily surprised? If not, you need to read this book. A better world could be created by making your customers happy and happily surprise. The Brand Manner Approach could give you the directions on how to maintain customers¡ satisfaction and create surprise to customers.The second part of the book provides you with guidelines on how to be confident in making customer surprised. It¡s good for the author to provide guidelines for different role of people like, CEO, marketing director, management, employees and customers. But this part is a bit complicated and not so easy to understand.This book is full of real world examples which are interesting and can help to illustrate the concepts the author wanted to raise. You will find you know more about the companies on the world more after reading and will be more confident in making customer surprised."
1,Approach with extreme caution.,"Notice that this book came out in September of 2003 and as of this date (10/2008) it does not have any reviews. Hopefully, this is an indication that no one has read it. I readily admit that I have not read this book, either. It is a matter of -- why would I want to waste my time reading heresy when there are so many valid and solidly Catholic works available? At the moment I can think of only one reason why one would read this book: to make a scholarly study and comparison to see how much the author got wrong; ergo, approach with extreme caution.For those of you who do not know, poor Father McBrien is a known (formal) heretic and has authored a number of heretical books. Presently, all I can say is -- please pray for this priest and all the priests and bishops who are going down the wrong road. And remember, the vast majority of priests are good and decent men. Amen."
2,"Good, but could have been better","Although both my wife and I enjoyed parts of this book, it was not nearly as good as his previous book on this subject ""In Search of the Ancient Ones."" Too much of the book dealth with conflicts between the participants on this hike. Not enough of it dealt with the ruins they explored and the land that they hiked through. I was disappointed in the book overall."
5,Reliving the moments,"I particularly enjoyed this book because I've canoed the San Juan River many times. It took me back to strenuous climbs up San Juan Hill, where the layers of rock are turned up, as one geologist states, ""like layers of bedding."" ""Baseball Man"" was also an often seen and photographed site. I hope all of the sites that he explored will remain protected from the collectors of artifacts, so that many generations will be able to see them and think on what life might have been like there, more than a thousand years ago."
5,Mandatory for heart rate strap,I was having trouble getting accurate consistent readings with heart rate monitor. This product solved my problem. I have a lifetime supply though...lol.
4,Beginning to understand,"Even though some formulations are still somewhat abstract for the average beginner the concepts of fine art will become clearer after reading the book. It is especially useful to understand the modernist movements, with its complex theories and ideas. The inclusion of philosophies, by ""name-brand"" philosophers; furthermore, helps the reader to tie the concepts together."
4,Spooky!!,This book mixed a little supernatural with a love story that wasn't too sleazy. It also addressed a huge problem in this country regarding what to do with mom and dad when one is sick but they both want to maintain independence.
4,Charming,Great read! I truly enjoyed the twist and turns of the story.Making Tina the bad guy really hard to figure out.
3,Fun to read,I enjoyed my early morning alone time to read this book...it turned out a little different than what I expected...
3,Long time coming,Reasonably average read - not too much effort required. Kept me interested enough to finish the book quite quickly. Good holiday read.
4,Very good,"I liked this book because of the main character, joy. She came across as a very loyal person . I love happy endings!!"
3,Just not my cup of tea.,"It started out really well, until the author threw in the paranormal stuff. That's where the story seemed to lose it steam for me. I'm not, nor have I ever really been into that type of story. For all of you who do enjoy that type of story, then it's probably worth reading. I guess it's just a case of what you prefer.Would I recommend this book? It all depends on whether I know that person enjoys stories involving the paranormal. If not, then no. If they do...I'd tell them to go for it."
1,Don't waste your time.,This free book was worth every penny. I don't understand it's high ratings. You knew the ending after the first couple of chapters. The author has little to say but says it over and over and over....
3,Ok book if you just want something light to read,"The book was too long and could have been much shorter as the author continued with the same theme over and over. Love triangle of Jeff, Joy, and Jenny who died their senior year jn high school. Really got boring. Interesting supernatural events concerning Jenny's home. I would not recommend this book."
5,Great Book,Love the story and how it was written. Would love to read more books written by Edie Claire. You will love this book.
3,Enjoyable,"This was a nice book. Had a happy ending and some mystery but it was easy to figure out who was the ""bad guy or girl"" so I only give it a three star rating. I would read more of her books though."
5,Romance and Supernatural,Loved this book. Could not put it down so much so that I kept reading till a.m. There were some parts that literally gave me goosebumps :)
3,Ok book,"I enjoyed the book for the most part, but Joy was stupid to me sometimes. I didn't understand,why it took to very end of the book she raised she loved Jeff"
1,Captivating,"Very captivating story read this book on 2 days, wasn't too entertained by the supernatural happen but the story did pan out"
4,Entertaining and compelling,I've added a new writer to my list! Edie Claire kept me entertained and curious. I read it in three parts and he last kept me going so I could find out all the mystery and tie up ends.
5,Light easy read,"This is just perfect for me, a little romance, a little mystery! This is the 2nd novel I've read by Edie Claire and enjoyed her."
4,Awesome,"This is a great book , takes you back to some innocent times in your life. Some special some not so special. The friendshipthat at the time you thought would be forever. Until the tragedy of death shakes your very psyche . Then you live your life thinking if you run from the truth it will never find you. Only to find that it's your salvation, and thankfully so. The love you have denied for so long is what has haunted you and also what you needed to remember ."
5,5 stars all day long!,"Let me just say OMG! This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read in my 25 years! Without a doubt it kept my attention from the first page. I can't say how impressed I am of how well the author wrote this book with such realism it's amazing. I always read books and usually find myself saying ""no..there's something missing...or...no way seriously?"" In most books it's so unreal it makes the book a lower rating. But I give this author much applause for making this book very real. I can relate.The characters are greatly created. I loved them all. The way the author describes them fits their roles perfectly through out the book.I laughed, cried,gasped smiled non-stop andeven got the goosebumps at times. All the characteristics a great book should entail. I wish every book was this good. I recommend this to everyone out there. Please give it a chance you won't be disappointed! There isn't one thing I disliked about this book. 5 stars Edie Claire!"
3,LOVE story with a surprise.,"This was a good story. I guessed part of the ending, but didn't see the other part, The supernatural story line was unexpectedAnd a little scary."
2,Liked but not loved,I really liked the story line but it seemed to drag on and on when it didn't really need to.
3,it's okay,The story line was good. Alittle to mushy for me thou not really into unrealistic love but all and all it was ok.
1,NO WAY,"Could'nt wait for this story to end, on and on it went with NO Big Ending. Would never say read this, needs alot of work for a good read.I kept thinking something was going to happen and it will get better but it just kept getting boring, and more boring as I continued."
3,Pretty good but...,"I am not a huge fan of super natural but this one played out pretty good. The chemistry between the characters was great but I became so frustrated with the ""I want him, I don't want him, I like him, I hate him"" attitude of the main character. With that said, I am glad to have read the book."
1,Excruciating,"If ever I wished I could NOT have to finish every book I start, it would have been on this book. It was so irritating! She wanted him, but she tells herself she can't have him....repeat 100 times. Ugh! Even though this book was free I feel like I got ripped off!"
3,Long Time Coming,"This was only ok,It would do for a holiday read,but don't expect too much from it and you won't be disappointed!"
2,Get to the point!,"This book was way too long for the story. I thought it would never end, and when it did......I only wanted too read about Joy and Jeff being together. I can't believe that it took the whole book for them to come together and then the book ended."
5,LOVE this book!!!,"I absolutely love this book. It was my first time reading anything by Edie Claire and it most definitely wont be the last. I just got done with Mary Campisi's books The Way They Were and Pulling Home (two other must-read books) and i was trying to find another book somewhat like it and i hit the jackpot. This book had great characters and a great plot. I read this book in three days and i could not put it down. I would stay up till 1 in the morning reading. I read a lot for a teenager and this has to be one of my new favorite books. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!! Also, If anyone has any suggestions on other books like this one, i would love to know."
3,Good Story,Enjoyed the book . A good read. The writer keeps you interested from biginning to end. The story is somewhat long and difficult to follow in places.
5,Long time coming,I just finished reading this book and I thought it was a fantastic read!! A few things that happen in this book are somewhat predictable however there were also several twists that I did not expect. I found this to be a pleasure as many times books tend to be too predictable. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romance book mixed with some mystery.
5,haven't read it,"Give me a break amazon! I have a lfe - suggest you get one too, etc, etc. etc. etc. etc."
4,Great Characters and Story!!,I really enjoyed this book and caught myself laughing out loud a few times. I definately will be readying more by Edie Clare!
4,good reading,"This book has it all , mystery, romance, adventure and fun.Mental illness is not to blame for everything but some use it as manipulation.Sad book but of course in the end We see the ""happily ever after"" in many twists, and it was all brought together in a fun read."
4,Long time coming,"I found the book to get my interest in the first chapter, which is always a good sign. I will read other books by this author in the future."
5,Engaging,"Loved this book. Had a hard time putting it down. It keep me interested with all the personal enteraction, romance, mystery and suspense. Just as you thought you had something figured out it would add a new twist. Tastefully written. Fun. This book is a great read. I believe the teenagers to the senior citizens will enjoy this book."
3,Poor guy,"The story was pretty good, but I got really sick of her,(Joy) whining and felt very sorry for poor Jeff, because I really liked him. The dialog was good and the story line interesting and catchy, but I sure didn't care for the heroine much. Hard to believe a nice guy like Jeff would put up with her treatment."
4,Good book,The book is a mystery romance without sex or dirty language. My aunts like to read good books but get frustrated by the dirty language that is in most of to days books. This is a good story with surprises and humor. The characters are plausible and the plot is good. Would recommend this book to everyone. Since it is a free book on kindle you have nothing to loose.
3,Heroine tangled in past,"This author is good. Her characters are well-written. I was rooting for the heroine ... in the beginning. As the book went on, I didn't put it down because I did want to find out what happened--the author did a good job of keeping me hooked.That said, I got really tired of the heroine's refusing to see what a gem the hero was. I didn't believe that a friend's death would cause this kind of disconnect, and I was ready for the hero to walk away. I started skipping pages of her inner struggles just to find out what happened in the end."
4,Mysterious,This book kept me interested. Couldn't put the book down once you get started. Written well for all who like a little romance and mystery.
5,Long Time Coming is a good read.,Good story with lots of characters. Each one though connected were all related to the subject of the story. Enjoyed it and the reality of it. It was up to date on the happenings of everyday life.
2,Slow story,didn't find this a very exciting story. Just OK but light enough to read through so eventually finished it - thanks
4,Good book,Easy light reading. An enjoyable read. Recommend for anyone who wants a diversion from real life.Why do I have to put in a minimum of words.
1,Ghost and/or spirits,Not interested in reading about such nonsense. I can't say how the story line goes because it was immediately apparent that this was not my type of book.
3,"Not great, but good","I've never read this author before. She writes good, but not great in my opinion. The book lacks the ''feel good'' element i look for in books i read. A warm, cozy, relaxing time in the story is missing. I feel sleep deprived & frustrated throughout the book, never being able to relax. The only thing i really like well in the book is the old house she lives in. But i could never get an exact picture in my mind of it. It took me most of the book to figure out if the book was going to be para-normal or where she was going in her story telling."
4,Good for the price,"This was the first book I read by Edie Claire, and it probably won't be my last. I enjoyed the story, and the depth in which she goes into for each character. It was a little draggy in parts but overall an enjoyable read - especially for the price."
3,It's O.K.,"I purchased this on by accident, but decided to give it a chance. Not a favorite. It starts out sounding kind of sappy."
3,Long Time Coming,"The story, while engaging, did not have a very good reason why she could not remember her friend's death. Dragged on a little too long."
4,Quick read,I found the story to be well written.The plot was rather predictable though and towards the ending you could see where the storyline was heading.
5,Before you go,Easy reading mystery wrapped around a heart tugging love story...leaving you unwilling to put the book down and yearning to read on....wishing.....hoping....working your mind to put the pieces together...loved it!
3,Long time coming,This was an okay book a quick read.I liked the beginning better than the end .it came to a rather abrupt end
4,Long Time Coming,I enjoyed reading Long Time Coming and would read more by Edie Claire. I really like the book and would recommend it.
4,Long Time Coming,"I really loved the book, especially the surprise ending. It was my first book about possible spirits after the character dies."
4,Free read is great!!!!!,"I was tinkering with my Kindle at found free books. I was kind of septical, but....................A great read. I would recommend this book with no hesitation. Bravo Edie Claire!"
2,Slow going......,I had a hard time finishing this book.I had to force myself to finish it.I found the whole story strange.To me the story was unrealistic. I would not recommend.
4,Could not put it down,"I lost a lot of sleep on this book. I found I could not put it down. To me it was a little predictable, but still a great read."
2,LONG TIME COMING,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK for anyone who likes mystery. It keeps you guessing to the end. I well tell my friends to read it.
3,Pretty good to have been free-,"This was my first book purchase on my kindle and it was a free book. I actually thought it was pretty good. Got a tad cheesy at the end with the Jenny ghost thing but for a free book, I really can't complain. I would recommend it."
3,not what i wanted,"not really memorible, author really needs to describe scenes better, for my taste i like descriptions, surrounding area and , thoughts"
3,Error.,Did not read this. Is it not my favorite genre or style. May have ordered by accident and canceled the order.
3,Started great but...,"This is a hard book to rate, the beginning is excellent, the middle was fine but the quality of writing in the last third was disappointing.This is romance novel with an unnecessary supernatural component. Joy (an odd name for a woman who has none) returns to her home town and must confront the man she holds responsible for the death for her best friend in high school. She has two men vying for her attention, a dying parent, a jealous ex-wife, someone trying to murder her, she is starting a new business, has revengeful business competition and the ghost of her died friend. This is too much junk to carry an effective storyline.It was free on Kindle so the price was right."
2,Surprised at such good reviews,"This had the potential for being a good book. But alas, the main female character was so neurotic and had such wild mood swings she really came off as being somewhat unbalanced. The main male character was too good to be true .. he put up with sooo much crap for her and just kept on understanding and accepting everytime she turned on him, which was pretty much every time she saw him. About half way through the book it was apparent what the big mysterious secret was - it was so very obvious that I thought it must be a red herring, but nope, the obvious was the obvious. As to who the bad guy was? That was fairly easy also. Were the characters written to be more balanced, it would have been a much better book. Glad it was free."
5,Good book,"This was a good book. It kept my attention from the beginning. It also had a wonderful ending, which I liked!"
5,I would have paid for this,"Believable characters, real and sometimes funny conversation between the characters, no bad language, a plot without a villian... this book is an old school GOOD BOOK and a keeper. Highly recommended."
3,Entertaining But Falls Short,"Edie Claire's Novel Long Time Coming holds a classic story line about a troubled woman who due to her aging parents, decides to come ""home"" and confront her past. While the first several chapters stay focused and well thought out, by the end of the book, the author continues to drive her main heroine into repetive questioning and behavior with other characters. The heroine ends up whining and feeling sorry for herself for not confronting her past sooner. Sadly, the plot could have been tightened up and without the miserable subplot attempted assasination. Over all, this book is mediocre and one to read but only because you are out of other reads."
4,not a bad free book,it wasn't interesting till half way through the book. The writing style was not my favourite but the content was not bad.
3,Long Time Coming,"A very good story. I like books written in the 1st person. It moves right along. I'm not finished yet, but I'll say it is a good book."
3,"Too long, too much and just TOO...","The book started off ok and I thought it would get better but there was just too many unnecessary components to make this a cohesive story. Some of the story lines in my opinion took far too long to develop. This was more of a mystery than a romance, which I didn't really mind but it felt like a task to finish this book."
4,Long Time Coming,"I enjoyed the story. It had some mystery as well as romance, plus nice description of the town it takes place in. A typical small town.."
4,Great read!,I completely enjoyed this story. I started reading it one afternoon and finally finished it around 3am...couldn't put it down.
5,Very enjoyable reading!,Enjoyed very much-Would recommend highly.I could hardly put it down once I started it. Will definitely check out other works by this author.
3,Long time coming,Was not a big fan of ghost stories but this one caught my attention. Was a very good read. The people were believable.
1,Not Very Impressed,"The premise of this story should /could have worked well. Long drawn out, too emotional, over and over again. Parts of the book read smoothly, others (read most) frantic dialog. How these two could overcome the juvenile (ness) of supposed adults and have a happy ending beats me."
3,Long time coming,"I really enjoyed this book. I do intend to find more books by this author. I find this book 3 stars but now rethinking it, I might end up giving it more."
5,Long time coming,Fantastic mystery/love story. Couldn't put it down. Would recommend to anyone who wants to get lost in a good story.
3,Good read,"Good read. Keeps you entertained... and while I found some of the plot predictable, I wasn't bored at any point!"
4,romantic read,"loved this story, the characters were pretty well written and i would definitely read another book by this author, good read"
4,"Good, fast, delightful read.","Enough suspense to keep up interest, just enough suggestion of sex and gender give and take to make the story interesting."
2,Easy read,Easy read. Held my interest but became predictable. Would read more by this author. Simple and easy to read. Okay
3,Long Time Coming,"Long Time ComingI found this book very easy to read, sometimes it is nice to read an uncomplicated book"
5,Must read,This was recommended to me by a coworker and I am so glad I read it. I would recommended it to anyone.
3,A decent light read.,"It wasn't bad for a romance. ;-) A little on the sappy side, but that's cool. If you're into romance and ghost stories, this book should make you happy!"
4,Rating of book,It was a great story with just a touch of suspense but too much about ghosts and spirits for my liking.
4,"Nice, clean, read...","This is a clean, quick-moving, nice book. The story is predictable but it's still worth your time. Hope you enjoy!"
5,Excellent book,Well written suspense with a little romance. I could hardly wait for the end. Looking forward to the next book.
3,Long time coming,"I had a really hard time getting in to this book. However , it may have went better had I started it at another time"
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat,"This book took me about 8 days to read little by little. I was not sure what to make of it at first. It is very clean, and seems to fit in with what a lot of people go through in real life. But I was NOT prepared for the ending. That took me by surprise and I just absolutely fell in love with the storyline and its characters. There's some surprises in here as well as endearing traits of the characters that really fit in with what I've seen in real life. AWESOME reading. It does keep your attention enough to keep you wanting to continue reading."
3,Umm. ok,"It did not keep me interested had to put down and keep coming back to finish the book took me two weeks, it was ok, but not all that"
5,Awesome,This book was great. I never saw the ending coming. I couldn't put it down. It was interesting an filled with everything a book should have. Done in very good taste
3,Long Time Coming,"It seemed to drag on and on and I had a hard time finishing it. It's ok the, but not something I would really recommend to someone else."
3,A book you have to really be in,In really liked this book but it took me almost the hole book to understand what was going on in this book. If you really like romance mystery you will like this book.
4,Very enjoyable,This is a very entertaining book. I enjoyed the slight paranormal plotline and look forward to reading more Edie Claire novels.
4,From Sorrow to Love,"I couldn't put this book down, and couldn't wait to find outwhat happened the night of the accident. I didn't see how the maincharacter helped out her parents much, but the slow recovery of griefwas a good basis for the story. Lots of angst, which I love.Bonnie Drury, author of THE ATA BITA PIE CAFE"
4,Long Time Coming,Good book with interesting characters and storyline. Well written with many twists and turns that leaves you guessing what's happening next. Love the vet and doctor angle of the book.
3,pretty predictable read,"pretty predictable read, girl lost friend, tries to find out why she feels the way she does..ends up the same as others"
3,It was ok,"I felt the author got a bit carried away explaining things... she took forever to get to the point . The story itself was pretty good, though."
5,Long Time Coming was FABULOUS!!,"This book was fabulous from beginning to end. The main characters are loveable, realistic and feel real the way they are written.I could not put this book down. It was that good!!! Love-love-loved it!!"
5,Great read!,"I loved this book. It was a a wonderful journey of friendship, forgiveness and healing. I was caught up in it from beginning to end. I would recommend it highly! Thank you for a great read!"
4,Love triangle,"A great story of happiness, sadness, loss and betrayal . Would re amend this book to all my friends ."
3,It is readable,"Which is more than I can say for a great many books of this genre. I do think the book skirts too many issues, does not commit to being a specific type of book. If you try to be all things at once you end up being so-so, and that is my final impression of this book. So-so. Readable, but I will not search out more works by the author."
4,Worth reading,It was a little slow bit was a good story. It was not overly predictable and I did not put the puzzle together until right before the character did.
3,Solid romantic thriller,"Long Time Coming, while not perfect, had characters and situations that were mostly very believable. More importantly, the lead character Joy is likeable."
3,Journey to forgiveness,"This moderately well-outlined book explores the road to forgiveness -- of self and others, while pointing out that motives are not always as they seem."
4,I liked the writer's writing style,I ended up ordering another book by the same author. The book was enjoyable to read on a cold winter's night
2,Long Time.,It took me forever to actually finish this book I actually read another one in the middle of it! I liked the characters and the writing style but the story line fell short everything I wanted to know were in the last 20 or so pages the rest of the book didn't really matter..
4,Another good read.,"I have to admit that I was not sure that this book would live up to the last Edie Claire novel I had read! Meant To Be was a terrific read from beginning to end. So often I am disappointed by a second novel by the same author. Not this time!Again, I was transfixed from the first chapter. Again I found characters that felt real, and warm and a story that was simply exquisite!More please, Ms Claire!"
2,"long, drawn out...","I found the book boring and predictable. I read it to the end because that's what I do, but it wasn't worth the effort"
2,i can't remember this one!,"I am a very avid reader and apparently this book wasn't very catchy because I don't even remember it. I remember the very first novel I ever read, but I don't remember this. That's a thumbs down for me."
4,Long Time Coming,"was a good book, would consider reading more of this author, was good and kept you interested very ,good read,"
3,A page turner,An easy read and a good escape from the reality of this world. It did t waste words with a lot of scenery subscriptions.
1,If you like a lazy read,"I don't generally read these kinds of books. It was ok for a cold winter afternoon when I needed something to do. I have friends that would like this book . It was clean, simple and mildly entertaining. Buy it for grandma!"
3,Long,This book wasn't what I expected but it becomes better and better the further you get into it and the ending was good.
3,I Expected More,"I expected more from this book being that it was rated so highly. I found that although the characters were well developed the story itself drug out which I found frustrating. Being free though, the price was right."
3,Long Time Coming,"With the story line, you almost didn't notice the ghost implications. Great characters with lots of suspense and anticipation. A good quick read."
2,Stayed too long!!,"Glad I didn't pay for this book.Childish and predictable ending.If you are a teenager you might like it, maybe not.!!!"
3,Not bad,"The plot was predictable, but the book was well written. I don't normally enjoy realistic fiction, which this is except for the ghost (mostly I read urban fantasy), but this kept my interest. The level of trauma the main character experiences from the death of her friend is not plausible, but if you can suspend your disbelief of that you will enjoy this book."
4,A great story!,I totally enjoyed this book and it made me smile at the end. If you need a feel good story this is it!
4,Grrreat,I was pleasantly surprised and on the edge of my seat by the story line. Discovering who was behind the plot took me by surprise.
2,"Jeez, get a grip","The heroine in this novel would have benefited from some intense therapy in the 18 years since her best friend died. It's remarkable that so many memories came back in the course of a few weeks, when she was able to lock them away for almost two decades. All the supernatural interference was merely a plot device meant to push the two main characters together. I like mindless escapism as much as the next person, but this was entirely too predictably rote."
4,Pretty good,Made me happy and a bit sad. Kept me going and it was a but surprising. Over all good job
5,Long time coming,Very enjoyable read. Just enough suspense to keep you reading. I could not put it down until I was finished. Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.
4,Nice book,"Interesting and engaging. The paranormal part of it added some interest, and I wasn't able to predict how it would turn out."
4,Good Diversion,"Good enough to keep me reading, A bit of a surprise at the end, a bit predictable. Enjoyed it and would recommend it for good light reading."
4,Long time coming,"This one keeps you guessing to the end while sending you off in different directions. A good read, well written."
3,Long Time Coming,Long Time Coming by Edie Claire was a good read. Liked the slight suspense and liked the ending. Held my interest
5,Comming home,Amazing read. Kept me guessing and interested. Perfect amount of mystery and romance. Would love to read more like this
3,Enchanted,An enchanting tale with a little of everything. A very enjoyable read. Thank you for the chance to enjoy a little getaway from my busy schedule.
3,Outstanding,This book is very good. If you like a good romance check this book out.Looking for a good read you will love it.
4,Really good book,"This is a fast-paced, intelligently written mystery - slash - horror read. It will keep you turning pages to see what happens. I especially liked the normal hometown with the hidden darkness underneath, and the spunky heroine's search for the truth. Recommend."
2,Below Average Horror Film,"Beyond Remedy is a German horror film shot in English, released as a DVD in America. The majority of the cast is German, save for the film's ""star"" Rick Yune, better known as Johnny Tran from the Fast and the Furious.There really isn't anything about this movie that stands out. The story and dialogue plods along slowly, there's an overemphasis on spooky music, and the end monologue by the lead actress is painfully hokey. It's neither scary nor interesting, the only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one, is because of the job done on the lighting and set design.The hospital setting is foreboding, and lends to the vibe that the director was obviously going for. The cafeteria scene is like something out of the first edition of Far Cry, which is something I appreciated. Otherwise, this movie is pretty forgettable."
5,"GREAT INDIE FILM WHICH IS A ""MUST"" SEE!","Watched this film last week. Very well shot, EXCELLENT special fx. This is a good representation for independent film makers! Right on...guys! I would highly recommend this movie."
4,Investors get inside scoop on stockbrokers,Pretty decent book on how stock brokers really operate. Shows how your interests are rarely (if ever) important to a broker. The book is a fairly quick read. Several examples of sales techniques followed by an analysis of each. At the end the author suggests that each of us is better off investing our money ourselves but does not give any additional information on how to do this other than the general comment of going to a bookstore and buying books on investing/personal finance. The author does a good job of not only criticizing the brokerage industry but also offers suggestions on how it can be approved. Overall I would say that it covers the topic well and opens the readers eyes.
4,Eye-opening reading.,"This book offers a very good view of investing from the eyes of the stockbroker and explains why his or her eyes are not necessarily focused on yourfinancial well-being. Chapter six was one of themost informative chapters. It reviewed the ""tricks of the trade""stockbrokers use to close an investment deal."
5,Smart!,This is a great book written with talent and skill smart. I recommend this book to anybody who is considering the stock trade. Cleverly written.
2,Sour Grapes,"Four out of five brokers do not last five years. That is why the ""salesmen"" get weeded from the people who have their clients interests at heart. The author is one who got weeded out. Good ideas to protect yourself from salesmen, but the indictment of the industry is overdone. Brokers do make their living from commissions, but cheating clients is not the way to build a practice. Best advice: Find someone who got past the wash-out phase."
5,Best of British!,A great British series with a superb cast of English actors. Light drama with lots of humour - nothing like it on US television.
5,Fantastic UK Series,"I started watching New Tricks when overseas and was thrilled to find it available for viewing and purchase in the US.It is a great detective type series with the characters quirkiness and interaction, all in a great show to watch, you will not regret it!"
1,Don't buy this!!!,I don't usually write a bad review but I have to in this case.This broke on the very first potato I put in it. I never did get a single french fry out of it. I then purchased the Progressive cutter which cost less from Amazon and it worked great.
1,Not a good buy!!,"I bought this item. All the extra cutting blades were great, but the handle broke the 2nd time that I got to use it. If you are going to buy something like this, I would suggest one that is made of metal and not plastic."
1,slicer,"This item is worthless as an apple slicer, it is to small for the apples to pass through.it was a waste of money. It might work to slice potatos if they are very small. I don't know I bought it to slice apples and it doesn't work."
3,Rock solid Digi Cam,"I have had this camera for over a year now and it still does a ok job. Its very durable as I dropped it onto solid tile floor twice , several times onto the street and all that happened was the battery flew out.The Batt cover does open very easy under normal condition anyway. Barely a dent or scratch. Overall it does a great job taking pictures for the average person.However you do at times see a purple line on the LCD when taking pictures under lots of sunlight. Red eye is also seen in my pictures using the flash at night. Taking video is not the best but does the job. The price is way more now than what I paid back in 2006-$299.00. So maybe the value has gone up?? This Camera would be better priced at the $150 range."
4,Great small compact camera,"I love this camera. My wife had the x50 and unfortunately I lost it while in a trip to DR. So I decided to buy another Minolta but this time upgraded to the x60 and its even better than my x50. The picture seems to be a little brighter and not as dark as the x50. But the camera is sexy and functional. I love the fact it can slip in my pocket and never be seen. But its also the reason I lost my first one because it is so small. But if you want a compact high quality digital camera, then the minolta x60 is for you."
2,Just another diet book!,"I've been taking Armour thyroid for the past year and have been very happy with the results. I have also been eating low carb Protein Power/South Beach style for 2 years. This book told me absolutely NOTHING I did not already know, and the ""diet"" was a mish mash of information and mis-information from all the popular diets currently circulating. What a disappointment. Don't bother with this book-even used. Not worth the money."
1,not what i expected,"The book is good if you do not know anything about thyroid disease, the book was not worth the money that you pay for it"
3,"Good for info, not all of it worth following","I was so excited to get this book and I read it like a bible. I tried many of the things that Shoman suggests. Some work, some don't. I think that's her point--it's all about trial and error for us hypothyroid people and what works for me may not work for you. She merely provides as much info as she's gathered about what's worked for some people. I'm glad I read it--not many of the things worked for me, but it helped me understand my condition better. Recipes weren't great--rather plain. I've been doing Sonoma for a couple of months and have lost 20 pounds--much happier with that diet and it's working! Sonoma fits the guidelines Shoman sets out very well. Worth trying"
3,Great for people new to hypothyroidism,"I got this book after I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, it has alot of great information for people new to this disease, but with all the research out there, don't go by this person's diet....that is something you will have to find out on your own. One thing for instance is the soy products, that is something you will have to experiment with, she praises it, but other medical professionals will tell you to stay away from it if you have hypothyroidism. Also alot of the vitamins aren't really good for you either. Some don't agree with you and some can really do some damage to your system and shake you up a bit so be careful there. This book is good for new comers to hypothyroidism but as for the food and vitamins please be careful."
1,Paid for a list of diets and links !!,"I cannot believe that I just paid money for a book that does little more than presenting thyroid problems, quoting other books, listing diets and web links ... but, I guess, there are a lot of desperate hypothyroid patients like me looking for solutions and for every desperate human being there's someone selling something ! My advice - also to me - if you're going to buy a book rather than look up the stuff online, for free - at least get one written by an actual doctor ! (by the way, all the editorial reviews on the book's Amazon page are on a reciprocity basis, as those people's books or products are all praised in this book....) What a scam.."
3,Thyroid Diet,"I found this book to be ""just okay"". Not one I would re-read or even refer back to (unlike some of my books of this nature). There is some useful information for the beginner thyroid patient. There is no miracle diet in this book."
1,Save Your Money,"All that this book does is suggest various popular diets, South Beach, Weight Watchers, etc. There is no diet in this book specific to the thyroid, so choose the diet you want to follow and get a good book on that diet instead."
1,A waste of money,"The title is deceptive. Most of the book is information about they types of thyroid problems and treatments available. There is no ""special"" ""Thyroid Diet"" in this book. Its simply a rehash of all the diet information out there about fats, calories, the glycemic index, etc., with a little input about some foods which may contribute to thyroid problems."
5,Helped a lot!,"I followed the thyroid diet presented in the book and knocked my tsh back into the middle of normal (I was the high side of normal, and have a thyroid tumor). I have been diagnosed with low level Hoshimoto's. I changed the results of the labs enough that my doctor said, ""how did you do that?"". I found the book informative on understanding thryoid disease and how to improve it. I still have horrible metabolism, so don't assume the diet will change that. It will, however help keep some of the other symptoms at bay. It helped my dry skin and energy level a lot (along with exercise). Low metabolism is not the only thyroid issue, there are issues such as tumors... and this helps keep them stabalized. In general, I just feel better."
3,the beginning of the book is redundant,"this is a good little book, but if you have read shomon's LIVING WELL WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM, much of what she says in the beginning of THE THYROID DIET is word for word redundant.that being said, one would expect from the title, THE THYROID DIET, that the majority of the book would consist of recipes. that is not at all the case. shomon continues giving tidbits of extremely helpful information for those of us who suffer with hypothyroidism. she includes a variety of descriptions of diets one could choose from as well as vitamins and minerals that might be helpful to include.the bottom line is that there is no one formula that works for all of us, but there IS a formula. don't give up until you find what's right for you and what makes you feel good again!!"
1,don't waste your time -- or money!!!,"if your diet consists of big macs, milkshakes and junk food, this book might be of some help to you. but if you already take care of yourself and eat a healthy diet, it doesn't provide any new information. it's all common sense -- cut the carbs, cut the fats, cut the calories. i have to agree with others who've reviewed it -- this is just a re-hash and mish mash of current diet philosophies. take the money you'd spend on this book and go take an exercise class! i didn't learn anything from this book that i hadn't already learned from my doctor."
2,DIDNT MEET MY EXPECTATIONS,I HAVE HAD HYPOTHYROID FOR 20YEARS AND I WAS ATTEMPTING TO FIND A DIET EXCERCISE PLAN TO HELP ME WITH MY WEIGHT LOSS ATTEMPTS. I FOUND IT HAD ALOT OF INFO ON THYROID AND MEDS BUT THE DIET PLAN WAS NOT REALISTIC FOR EVERYDAY LIFE.
4,why only in america!!!!,"I bought this book as i have just been told i have an under active thyroid. No other health problems.I asked if there was anything i could do to help myself, no came the reply, then i ordered this book from Amazon that is written by an American. Much to mysurprise there is food groups, supplements, life style choices that you can make that may have an effect on your thyroid.Surprise suprise, why is it you only find these things out from the Americans!"
4,Much better than her first book I bought,"This one had a lot of information that was well organized and the whole thing was put together very well. She still is very wordy and takes a lot of ""wading"" to get through it all but you will get a lot out of it."
1,Not for me,I realized that this book was not for me and that is 100% my fault. When I tried to return it within the 30 days they imposed a penalty so after paying for postage back I would have gotten about $1.50 back. I'll just donate the book.
5,"The Thyroid Diet - "" A Must Have""","The Thyroid diet is an essential book to buy for anyone who has, would or like to diet or even anyone who is interested in how their metabolism works. As a health care professional and a thyroid patient, I can say that it is helpful for people with or without a thyroid problem. Ms. Shomon's writing is very clear and concise. She also has many years of experience with thyroid problems herself in addition to her wealth of knowledge on the subject so you know you are getting the best advice."
4,The Thyroid Diet,"I found the book very informative. Especially the vitamins that might help lose the belly fat and weight loss. I have invested in the CLA and have had to invest in calcium as I am on active duty right now and have already suffered a stress fracture due the time that I have had to be on my feet. I'm hypothyroid, have had a hysterectomy with everything taken but an ovary and would like to lose the belly fat and tone up in other places.I also explains the adrenaline rushes I have at night after eating too much carbohydrates. Due to the long days at the office during this deployment to a warzone, there isn't much time to exercise and eat like a should."
2,Good,"I expected more info from this book. Should be for people who have just found out that they have hypothyroidism, I already knew the majority of the contents of the book.But quick service, thank you."
3,Thyroid Diet:: Manage Your Metabolism for Lasting Weight Loss by Mary J. Shomon,"Mary J. Shomon's book is more a resource for information on thyroid disease than a diet/cookbook. Less than 100 pages of a nearly 400-page book are devoted to recipes and diet plans. I was expecting this book to be heavier on that information and lighter on the background as I obtained that from reading ""Living Well with Hypothyroidism."""
2,Not a diet,"This is not a diet, it is an overview of all the other stuff Shomon has out. It is a recommendation of how to manage your thyroid, if you haven't read anything or are just finding out about a thyroid problem, it has lots of information, but if you have had thyroid problems and know about them, it is the same stuff you've always heard. I didn't learn anything new, and it really isn't a diet............is was disappointed. No new answers for those of us who are being treated with medication. If weight is a problem, as I have with thyroid problems, this is not the answer.........."
3,Could use more info,"Suffering from Hypothyroidism for over 25yrs. Decided to get to book because I always look to enrich my knowledge about the condition. Was disappointed, I've had more info from my own research over the yrs then they had in this book. Anyone can find the info that is in that book on their own. At least I didn't pay much for it."
3,I'm not sure what to think!,"After reading all 18 reviews posted here I find it disturbing that only one mentioned losing any weight. But to be fair,I don't know if it's right to negatively label this diet as a mish-mash of all other diets. Don't all diets share in common three basics. Proteins, fats and carbs? Unless sources for nutrition have radically changed from the norm then all diets are essentially working with these same three nutritional elements and some repetitiveness is to be expected. Could attention to the fine details of a diets contents help those of us with Thyroid problems to lose weight? I was hoping to discover that as an unbiased answer here before I bought the book. Back to reading in the isles of Barnes and Noble I guess."
3,"Not Good, Not Bad","I ordered this book hoping for a definitive diet for hypothyroidism. I scanned the book and put it on my bookshelf because it wasn't a ""diet book"". I recently pulled it down to look at it again and discovered after you get past the first 200 pages, it is a diet book. It would have been nice if the author mentioned the ""diet"" was in the very last section of the book instead of making us read through a bunch of stuff we either -- already knew or didn't want to know to lose weight. Those of you who read Contents probably didn't encounter this problem. Now that I understand I have a diet book, I'll check it out. This might prove to be a marvelous book but I've given it 3 stars because it is so poorly laid out."
4,Great book!,"This book is a great introduction to Virtual Reality technology. If you've been wondering what VR is all about, this is the book to read."
4,Crock-pot cooking,"This product works well. Good temperature control. Cleans easily. The only negative thing is I wish it was bigger..I got a smaller one than I had 'cause my husband said I shouldn't cook so much food just for the two of us...this, in no way, is a criticism of an excellent product."
1,"Didn't order this item, nor did I receive it!","Don't know what this is about, but I never wanted it, nor did I receive it! Must be floating around in a truck somewhere."
2,Disappointing at best,"This work typifies my frustration with Longman - much too interested in critical exegesis rather than a pastoral concern. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this work. He adopts a very pessimistic view of Ecclesiastes and often finds the author (someone other than Solomon) to be confused and disjointed. Frankly, highly disappointing for a supposedly evangelical author."
2,"Poor Quality, I was expecting more.","The problem with this book is that the author seemed to take the exact questions from his Oracle 8 practice tests and copy them into this book. I even saw numerous questions that said ""In Oracle8..."" shouldn't it say 8i?There is a reason Oracle 8i has its own set of tests, there are new features and added/deleted objectives. Case in point, in the first Network Administration practice exam there are about 6 or 7 questions on Oracle Intelligent Agent. Unfortunately Oracle Intelligent Agent is not covered on the actual 8i exam. Also I found two or three questions in the practice exam that were dead wrong. All this in just 20 minutes of reviewing the book in the store.I don't recommend this book to anyone that is serious about getting their OCP. Stick with the Sybex books and the STS exams(if you really need the extra practice). I did all my studying with just the Sybex books. Good Luck."
1,Don't count on this book for guidance to OCP,"Usually the Couchman books are pretty good and cover the necessary material. Not in this case, though. The actual exams cover a lot of topics that are not even mentioned in passing in this book. You'll be wasting your OCP exam money if you think this book can guide you. You'll have to find your practice material elsewhere."
2,Poor Quality,"The problem with this book is that the author seemed to take the exact questions from his Oracle 8 practice tests and copy them into this book.

4,Interesting thoughts,I think we should all listen to our bodies and this book helps one do that. It is well written and easy to understand.
4,Earth Rising....,"A very good historical overview of the Environmental Movement. It's a little dated today, but it provides an excellent historical context...."
4,Idiots Guide to Understanding Catholicism,"A very informative book and expertly laid out in a fun, quirky, easy to read fashion. There are; however, lots of little details about catholicism that are just plain incorrect and that's unfortunate. I agree with a previous reviewer of this book: If you're looking for the same kind of informative book that is just as informative, easy to read and also fun, check out WHY DO CATHOLICS DO THAT by Johnson. My wife recently converted to Catholicism and this book, more than any other book or even RCIA program, answered so many of her questions and truely was a wonderful introduction the the faith as well as being a good brush up for me!"
3,"Fun to Read, but what's this about Mary Magdalene?","I enjoy the formats of the ""Complete Idiot's Guides..."" and decided to read the one on Understanding Catholicism before marrying a Catholic. Here's my gripe: there is a half-page on Mary Magdalene, the first person to see the risen Christ, yet it doesn't say much more than that she was a prostitute. Despite Pope Gregory the Great's homily on how the sinner in Luke and MM are one and the same, many scholars now contend that there is no Biblical evidence that MM was engaged in the ""oldest profession.""...The Idiot's Guide to Understanding Catholicism is a fun read, and instructional, but be aware that it may have other commonly held-beliefs touted as facts."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"As a Cradle Catholic who became lax in her faith for too many years I have been trying to read things that can help me in my ""recovery"". I saw this book and decided to purchase it. As I was reading it I found many things that just didn't sound right. I asked our parish priest to look at it without giving him my opinion on the book. He returned it to me and basically recommended that I burn it. I will not even sell the book at a garage sale because I do not want it to fall into any one else's hands. Do not wste your money on this book."
2,"Catholic-Lite, Sloppy and Inaccurate, Disappointing","While this does have some useful information, and is nicely organized, this is clearly written from the Liberalist wing of the Catholic Church and is distressingly close to the Libreralist wing of the Episcopalian Church in many aspects. Within one page, the authors indicate Roman Catholics genuflect before sitting in the pews to 1) Honor the Presence of the Lord or 2) honor the altar. Which? I thought is was to honor the presence of the Lord. Another inaccuracy: they say G.K. Chesterton spoke on radio shows in the UK in the 1930s and 1940s - but Chesterton died in 1936. Do they mean C.S. Lewis, the orthodox Anglican apologist respected by many Catholics? This book is ""Catholic-lite"" and I do not recommend it for Catholics or anyone else. Get Karl Adam's ""The Spirit of Catholicism"""
3,Miss Conceptions,"There are alot of things wrong in this book. One we genuflect towards the alter to show respect to Christ...Our belief is Christ is present on the alter, we are not doing this to an empty altar. But the book still helps you understand some of the catholic ways even if some are not correct."
1,"Seems good, but subtle errors","FIrst thought the book would be good and seemed to give a decent overview. Was first cautious however when there was no official ""nothing against faith or morals"" Nihil Obstat mark that usually accompanies Catholic texts. WHile there were many good insights made about the Church, there were also some unfortunate comments about contraception and women's ordination that simply lies outside the mentality of the Catholic Church's official teachings. Making such statements tends to weaken the case for the intent of the book as being a guide. With the popularity of the ""idiots guide"" series, this book unfortunately makes the title more fulfilling than its attempt to do otherwise."
1,Belittles the Catholic Faith,"This book is filled with over-simplifications and errors about the ""tribe"" of Catholicism. It questions the literal virginity of Mary by implying that her virginity refers only to the fact that she is unmarried), claims that tradition chages with time (Catholic doctrine develops over time, it NEVER changes), calls Teresa of Avila a Zen Master (and refers to Madonna as a modern-day mystic). It misinterprets the role that personal concience ought to play in Catholic morality and generally encourages cafeteria Catholicism. Avoid this one like the plage - get ""This is the Faith,"" instead."
2,Limited--not always correct--information,"I bought this book as a new Catholic because I craved more information about the church and my new faith. It has disappointed me at almost every turn because the information given is so scanty, and often what I am looking for is not in the book. In one instance (wish I could specifically remember which subject), I found it to be incorrect. If you want a very broad overview of the faith, this book could work for you. If you want something with depth, steer clear of this one."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am not prone to writing a review, but there's something not right with this book. I bought this book with the intention of using as a ""refresher course."" After reading it, I thought the authors needed a refresher course. For example, the authors consider the singer, Madonna, a Catholic mystic. When you think of a solidly faithful Catholic, does the singer Madonna come to mind? I am pretty sure the answer is no. That is one glaring example of some of the ""mis-steps"" of the authors. I have never thrown away a book before but this book was my first and, hopefully, my last. If you would like to find a book that explains the Catholic faith in a down to earth language and represents the faith accurately consider, ""Catholicism for Dummies."""
2,Useful but misleading,"Reader beware. While this book contains some useful information about Catholic practices, the theology expressed is often misleading and sometimes downright ...wrong. Mary is called virgin because she was ""autonomous"" - uh....no. If you want an explanation of some Catholic practices, this is okay. But if you want an explanation of the Catholic FAITH - go to the Catechism of the Catholic Church."
1,Warning--This book is not doctrinally sound,"PLEASE do not purchase this book if you want to learn about Catholicism. I found an error on the first page I opened up to in the bookstore.Instead, look into getting ""Catholicism for Dummies"" written by solid, orthodox, Roman Catholic priests."
1,Purchase Catholicism for Dummies instead,This book does not represent the church correctly. There are things in the book that the church does not approve of or is stated incorrectly. If you want an easy book about the church buy Catholicism for Dummies instead. It is a great book and very easy to understand Father Trigilio is a priest that helped with the book for Dummies and he knows what he's talking about! Please don't be misinformed by the Idiot's Guide!
2,Potboiler,"I was disappointed in this book. I approached it expecting to find lots of in-depth explanation for Catholic belief and practices, yet I came away feeling as if it was written to fill a gap in the Idiot's series (after all, they know a little about everything). The authors didn't seem well informed and sometimes employed a not-endearing flippancy. There are lots of good books about the Catholic faith that don't take this generic, often erroneous approach and I would recommend the serious reader look elsewhere."
5,fun and informative,i did not grow up catholic but i married one--this book provided great information and insight about a very broad religion. i liked that i could skip around and there were pictures and jokes and an easy format to follow. good work for such a comprehensive topic.
1,Get the Catechism instead,"I haven't read this book (and I don't know why anyone who is serious about learning about Catholicism would), but I have heard from numerous fellow Catholics that it is riddled with misinformation about Catholic beliefs."
5,Thank God I read the book BEFORE the conservative reviews!,"The spirit of the Idiot's Guide is consistant here. The trivia is amazing! Why would the ""Schollar-bullies"" wish to pick a fight with accuracy? I too can split a hair! This is the first ""down to earth read"" I've had in a while, Thanks!"
1,This book is heresy,"I believe Scripture warns us that not many of us should become teachers (of the Faith), for we will be judged more strictly for leading others astray by what we teach. Robert O'Gorman should have kept this in mind before offering his work to the multitudes.This is not a book of Catholicism at all; it is a book about what the author THINKS Catholicism is. Unfortunately for all those out there who will purchase and read this, the author's views aren't in line with the Church. Buy Catholicism for Dummies if you really want to know about the Catholic Church. Buy the Complete Idiot's Guide if your conscience can't take real Church teaching but would prefer to be coddled by watered-down ""teachings."""
5,Excellent and Informative,"This book is incredible. I was looking for a book to read up on Catholicism and the beliefs and rituals of the Catholic church and happened to pick up this book. It was EXACLTY what I was looking for. It is very informative and easy to read. It includes not only the history of the Catholic church, but actually goes through a Catholic mass with prayers and rituals written in the book. It also talks about Catholic beliefs and views of many issues today such as abortion, divorce, homosexuality, etc... It is really good, especially for an RCIA elect or just someone who wants to learn more about the Catholic faith. I highly recommend it."
2,I was hoping for more ...,"I was hoping for a good outline of the Catholic Faith ... but what I got was a good view of Bob O'Gorman's faith, which isn't always Catholic. Other reviewers have pointed out some of the errors -- and there are quite a lot -- so, contrary to my hopes, this boook isn't really an adequate guide for the curious or the prospective convert. Perhaps the ""Idiots"" in the title refers to the authors, not the readers ..."
3,Not the Jersey that is pictured!,"this is actually a ""D.Williams"" Jersey not a ""Williams"" jersey...I asked them to change the picture after they messed up my order and I pointed this out, however they didn't..they seem to want people to buy the wrong thing...don't be fooled like they fooled me >:("
1,Don't buy this for the Iphone,"This is a really cheesy product. The retractable cord is really tight to plug into the iphone. The AC outlet adapter does not charge the phone. 1 out of the three piece work, which is the cigarette adapter, but it was secure loosely in the cigarette port."
3,Multi-Tool Set with NO Power Tools,"My 3 year old loves this set. However, I think it is overpriced. The name implies there are power tools, as well as hand tools. There are not. I should have read the description closer. I thought the photo showed 2 sets. My son is happy with it though and the tools are sturdy."
4,Deluxe Tool Set,This gift was for my 3 yr. old son. He has really enjoyed it and the pieces seem very durable. I love how all the tools go back into the case for easy storage.
3,A Solid Product But Two Caveats,"This product, like all Pyrex, is of excellent quality however, there are two things I do not like. First, the lid is difficult to get off. (I am not physically impaired) Second, the glass portion has handles. While this would be good if you were using it for baking and needed the handles to get the dish in and out of the over, they take up a great deal of extra space in the fridge. If you plan to use the dish primarily for food storage, I would go with the syle of Pyrex dishes that do not have the handles and have the easier-to-use lids."
2,Leaking,"A month ago, I bought a pyrex storage deluxe 4-cup size dish with lid. I really liked it-good size and design, thick glass, no leaking. It seemed to preserve food longer. I wanted to buy more dishes, but 4-cup size dishes were not available any more, so I ordered four 5-cup size dishes. Disappointingly, all of them were leaking liquid because the lids were not enough tight. I've found that lids of these 5-cup size dishes are differently made from that of the 4 cup dish which I bought first."
1,Outdated,"Am I the only one who had a problem with the fact that this is a 30 year old book (1976) that was merely repackaged to look new? Look through it... you won't find a ""best, worst or most unusual"" from any date more recent than 1976."
1,Meh,"Got this from my bargain hunting family one xmas.Anyway i read about this guy named James Bartley who survived being swallowed by a whale (yes, in this book:)) I thought, ""whoa, thats crazy"" I ended up telling a few poeple about it cause it kept coming to mind. Anyway, now that a handful of decades have passed, turns out the tale lacks in truthiness. outdated triva books are pretty weak.Oh, i find the organization of this book to be, well, random seeming. (like this review)One thing this trivia book does have on others though is they are not kidding about ""unusual."" These poeple are right, who are saying, these are rediculous stories. I just wish i could know it was all true. I'll have to double check other parts now."
5,Exactly what I wanted.....,"In the past I've spent lots of money on air filters and wondered if they really work. Recently I was told that those expensive filters do not work. So, I ordered two boxes and I'm really pleased so far with the fact the dust seems to be staying out of the house."
4,Great price and gets the job done.,I bought 3 boxes of this filter. I wanted to change the filter every month since there is lot of construction going one in my new community. This filter does the job and is a great price when compared to other filters in the market.
2,BETTER than Wendy Alec's Work,"The Fall of Lucifer is one of the greatest mysteries of Christian mythology. Milton was the first, and it appears so far to be the last one, to do this subject right. It seems that even though only a sparse amount of Scripture references this subject, too much creative liberty has been taken in to portrayal of the angels and Heaven. In writing from a human perspective, the author unfortunately makes his characters too human. As a scholar of this subject, I find this book horrible.HOWEVER, let me give two important notes of counter-balance.1 - This is a VERY difficult subject to turn into fiction.2 - No matter how much I didn't like this book, it is still better than the version Wendy Alec wrote. And for that reason and that reason alone, I give it 2 stars."
3,Interesting elaboration on Christian Mythology,"Not on par with Milton, but a pretty good story. This was a decent retelling of the Christian myth of the fall of Satan. The only reason that I didn't rate it higher is that it has the typical Fundi Christian mistrust (to downright hatred) of Acedamia and anyone who thinks for themselves. They must be EVIL if they challenge my narrow minded literal interpretations. But all in all, not a bad story -- though not to be confused with historical facts."
1,cant even get through to chapter 3,"i found this book to be very boring, i havent even made it to the 3rd chapter yet, it is totally not what i expected"
1,bad picture,"the white and grey as well black and grey are just black and white! Very dissapointed and misleading! I will keep them, but just post the right picture I don't have money to spend on what I dont want."
4,Eye of the Queen is a very involved yet accessible novel.,"Set in the not-so-distant future, the earth has explored most of its neighboring star systems. A surprise comes when the earth is suddenly visited by the first extra terrestrial species that posesses superior technology. Marius Thorndyke and Tomas Mnaba, contact linguists from earth, travel to the planet of the super race and encounter answers to the ultimate questions of mankind. Very engaging, stunning visuals, imaginative dialogue and characters. Very well worth reading, if you can get a copy."
2,Hit the Spot -- Core Complete,"It's alright. Not one of my favorites, but then everyone has different tastes when it comes to exercise."
1,core workout,"When I ordered this product,I failed to realize that you needed the stability ball in order to do the dvd. I did not want that type of workout, so wanted to return it. I still have the dvd, as Amazon has been HORRIBLE with their customer service and the return!!! I had problems with the return information on the internet, so contacted cust. svc. - they have repeatedly said the only way I can return the dvd is by a return label that they will mail to me immediately. It's been well over a month and I still have no return label, after contacting cust svc. multiple times. No more ordering via Amazon for me."
3,Bored and Confused!,"I am a big Denise Austin fan (or at least I used to be), but I couldn't get into this workout. I wish the moves were done with more reps so that I could actually feel the it working. I usually don't have a ton of problems keeping up with Denise's instruction, but this video was frustrating. I wasn't really sure if I was ever doing the moves correctly. Also, the transitions between each circuit were choppy, and certain moves were repeated. I shut it off after 30 minutes and put in a Jillian video, which kicked my butt. I am giving this Denise Austin video to Goodwill. Sorry, Denise!"
3,You must have a workout ball to perform the routine!!!,"Denise Austin is the best---but, whoever provided the DVD discription failed to mention that this entire DVD is workout ball driven. So, if you don't have a workout ball and/or the space to store it, this DVD is a waste of money...Too bad, because the routines look great..."
3,Good DVD on mute,I had never seen this woman before. She's a female version of an enthusiastic Mr. Mackey from South Park. I didn't find her tolerable to listen to. Good exercise though and good variety.
2,Denise Austin Hit the Spot Core Complete,Disappointed that it did not say you needed a ball for the workout. I never would have purchased this cd if I had known because I do not like using a ball in my workouts.
3,Definite Core Workout...,I had high hopes for this workout but it is definitely more of a core workout. The upperbody workout spent about 5 minutes working the arms and the rest was core while the legs and buns spent an adequate amount of time working those specific muscles.I am glad I did not spend money on this and rented it from the library because it was not worth my money.
5,My favorite workout from Denise,"I would say-this is the workout for fast results. It doesn't seem to be that hard while you are working out, but your body can feel it even in an hour. If you need to get toned fast-get this DVD."
2,OK,This product is good for those who have great balance and have been exercising for a while. I still need more time for this product so if you are a beginner not a good place to start.
4,This does hit the spot!,"I recently received this video and have done the workouts twice, and at first I didn't feel like I was working very hard, but my body said different in the morning! I think this is a good workout if you are short on time. And I know people think Denise is nuts, but I think she's funny and she keeps you motivated while you work :)"
4,Good for Body Sculpting,"Another one of my favourite Denise Austin DVDs. This one is really good for sculpting those important female problem areas. Especially the butt! It also targets the abs, legs, and has a full body workout. The DVD is divided into four different exercise segments which targets each of these areas. The butt workout is my favourite, as I'm always a little paranoid about getting too big there. What girl isn't, I guess.This one is definitely worth adding to the collection for all you exercise gurus.Denise Austin: Boot Camp - Total Body Blast"
3,good book,"this book is very good, and for players 1600+ it may very well improve your game if you work through it thoroughly. Enjoy!"
1,Where is the road at first?,"the writer is writing the book about himself hoping to have the reader to benefit out of his own history... it is not the case really.to start with, the language is not good at al. when it comes to chess the writer is like pouring though chunks here and there."
3,I don't know...,"After having read the reviews I bought this rather pricey DVD. I am a great fan of Boston Legal and was however really disappointed. Indeed, the whole thing is conducted in a really stiff way. One would think that they are at a meeting of the UN council discussing world peace or something like that. Also a writer for Rolling Stone magazine (come on, that is one paper that is over-the-hill and which never really was good with movie reviews)who thinks he is funny and intelligent introduces the whole thing. I mean this is too much. Also some of the actors come over as stiff and much less lively than on the show. James Spader for example was really disappointing: I mean in the show he is fantastic and here...a bore. Buy this only if you must."
4,Very enlightening interviews,"Good questions answered by the cast and crew of the first season. I'm glad I bought it. I would like to have heard more from Betty White and James Spader, but it was good as it stands."
1,Disappointed,This camera has an attractive look and price but it does not take good pictures. I bought this camera for my 12 year old daughter and although she was happy with it (she's happy with anything pink) I was very disappointed at the quality and functionality.
1,Worst Experience,"I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day.I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money.I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option."
5,AMAZING PHOTO CAMERA!!!,"I am so happy with my R1 even now there are not a lot of cameras that can compare to R1 since it's not SLR. Clear photos. Over 23000 photos so far and no problems at all. Have this camera for 5 years and it is great for everything I need. I consider my self mid-heavy photographer and just happy and nice moments with this camera. I would buy it again, no doubt!"
