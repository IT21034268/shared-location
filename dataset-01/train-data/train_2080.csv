5,Josh Groban's first CD,"This is a wonderful CD! I have purchase at least 10 copies to give to friends, keep one in the office, one in the car, one at home and one to take on trips. He is very talented and has chosen beautiful music on this CD. Can't wait for his second CD...or a concert."
1,"Beware of ""bait and switch""","I ordered this as a birthday gift for myself. I already have the U.S. version. When it arrived, I put it away carefully with my stash of rare and precious editions of Josh Groban CD's. 3 months later, I took it out and discovered there was NO BONUS TRACK !!! It has a band of Japanese(?)writing on it, but otherwise it is just the same 13 track CD you can purchase anywhere, but I paid $37 for it. Luckily I had charged it with my Amazon.com credit card and they immediately gave me full credit, but I still would like to have the real thing. Oh yeah, and it was shipped to me by Warner Brothers themselves!"
5,voice of an angel - in a man - gasp!!??!,"Truly this man has the voice of an angel and is the only singer, period, that can make me cry. I was flabbergasted when I first heard him sing and have been wearing out my copy of his CD ever since. EVERY song on this album is phenomenal and beautifully sung. I would just die to have a voice like this. Anxiously awaiting his new album..."
5,WHAT A BEGINNING !!!!!!,"Josh is probably the most dynamic voice to come on the music scene in American since Sinatra. Great album even though many songs were foreign language (English, Spanish) Only criticism is his duet with Charlotte Church on ""The Prayer"". Her voice is so weak and breathy that you just want to erase her track. Hopefully he will avoid her in the future. But otherwise, this is one of the best bets for 2001-2002"
4,Now I'm A Grobanite!!!!,"Josh Groban's break-through is nothing but astounding you can simply tell that all he has is non-forced talent that has been taken care of and well-nutured by years of faithful toturing... Not only that but, despite his new-found fame he remains a very down to earth person. You can tell that there is nothing generic or fake about Groban.I listen and re-listen to his C.D. hundreds of times on my iPod. Each time I listen to ""Your'e Still You"" and ""Home to Stay"" I find myself falling in love with his charming voice. You can tell by his smooth sounds that there is nothing forced about it.This C.D. is great for any easy-listening fan or any good music fan... I love this C.D. and all in all it's one of the best C.Ds I own. Please buy this C.D. I promise you it's more than worth it's price-tag!!!!"
5,To where you are,"I'm 60 years old and can say honestly that in all my years of listening to male singers, Josh Grogan will go down in history as the best male singer. The first time I heard, TO WHERE YOU ARE, I cryed, not just becouse of the song,but the beautiful tenor voice I was hearing. Frank Sanatra and Dean Martin dont come close to this young man. I've heard the three Irish tenors and they will never be in Josh Gorbans League. Thank you Josh for shairing your beautiful voice with us"
5,The Best I Have Heard In Years,"I actually had never heard Josh Groban but had heard of him and decided to buy the cd while shopping. I am truly amazed at the maturity and beauty of his voice. I have not stopped playing the cd. I cannot wait for another and when he tours to Washington, DC. Every single song was beautifully done and moving. Bravo!"
1,Absolute garbage,"This stuff is garbage. Normally, I'd just say oh, I don't like so-and-so's music or something like that, but this drives me mad. The fact that this drivel is selling is a reflection of the sad fact that religious right-wingers are gaining power in the US. Someone once played this for me when I said I liked opera. Nooooo, opera is a classical music form. This Groban is a Christian light rock singer. I know all the Christian rock lovers are going to give this review bad marks, but HA HA...I'm glad to be able to do my part toward decreasing the 5 stars this trashheap got. Wish I could give zero. A sad commentary on where our culture is going."
1,So bad it makes my head hurt,"This guy Groban is a corny kook. He sings sappy, awful love songs. The fact that so many people like him shows how stupid so many people are. When I see him on TV looking all mopey and dopey, I want to punch him in the face. If you like horrible junk like Celine Dion and Clay Aiken, you'll probably like Josh Groban too."
2,At least he's not Charlotte Church!,"Like Charlotte Church, Josh Groban is very gifted to have such a beautiful, mature voice at a young age. The selections here show off his warm, rich, sound, but it is easy to tell that his singing technique is juvenille even if his voice sounds mature. The color and depth of his voice lends itself well to classical music, but the vibrato doesn't spin evenly and there are a few intonation (pitch) problems that are surprisingly apparent. It is obvious that the recordings here are doctored with lots of reverb--hearing him unamplified would be interesting. If he follows the footsteps of Charlotte Church, however, and includes real opera arias on his next CD, he will be well on his way to ruining his voice prematurely. In my opinion, he should have stayed in school and developed a more solid singing technique before venturing out into the recording industry! I'd hate to see a voice like that suffer the same fate as Charlotte Church's."
2,The voice was beautiful but...,He should of saved his money/voice for a good recording studio. Josh's exquisite voice was drowned out by the music..
2,still needs maturing,"The music is fine when you hear it in an elevator or in the supermarket. But any more than that, you will notice that his voice isn't ready for prime time yet. It's good, but just not good enough.Give him a few more years to mature his voice"
2,He is not Andrea!,"Very nice for a young fellow. Lovely voice. He definitely does not have Andrea Bocelli's ""animal magnetism"". Andrea sings in English, Italian and Spanish also, but he can tear your heart out with a beautiful ballad and thrill you with a soaring aria with high notes that just float on and on."
2,He's no Andrea Bocelli....,"Fair effort. It's ok, but that's all. He tries to copy Bocelli's style of singing. Like they say Imitation is the best form of flattery right. He needs to be himself and find his own style of singing. I agree also with the reviewer that says he needs to sing with more emotion in his voice. His inexperience shows but he's young and hopefully will grow in time. For now he needs to practice, practice, practice, like they say."
3,Shining star - of a small genre,"Josh has an impressive voice - particularly considering his age - which will only get better. But dont get carried away with that.As some have noted, the production can get in the way on this album - but not sure if it werent for Foster that josh would even be in the position to put this record together, so you take the good with the bad. And Josh's reliance on other's means that he doesnt have it all yet.His notes are well-sung, though WITHIN THE FIRST TRACK there were notable transitional glitches.Furthermore, remember, he is a cover artist. Hey, I thought the Symphonic Rolling Stones stuff was pretty neat, but I still didnt get too excited by re-doing other people's songs.So, if you already have all the Andrea Bocellli stuff, and everything John Tesh has done (cuz really, that's the genre), then go for this. Really, this album has less the warmth and fantasy of Sarah Brightman (or, heck, Clannad) and more the schmaltz and cheap-trickery of Andrew Lloyd Webber."
2,The Reincarnation of Karen Carpenter?,"Beautiful voice but what schlock he sings. I hope someday he puts his voice into some serious music instead of this sentimental 3-hankie pop. This album gets old fast unless maybe you just broke up with your boyfriend and you're eating too much chocolate.Sweet like those photos of kittens playing with yarn, but I was hoping for a lot more here."
5,Learn C#.net with Harold Davis as Your Personal Tutor,"I've been a fan of Harold Davis for years and have found his programming language books to be not only very useful, but also fun. C#.net is a powerful strongly typed language that fully incorporates the principles of object oriented programming. With this DVD in your hands you have Harold Davis by your side as you learn the ins and outs of C#.net. The features of the Visual Studio.net development environment are carefully explained, and then you are guided step-by-step as you master the features of C#.net. In addition to what may be more familiar programming constructs, you will learn to work with objects and inheritance. Davis doesn't shy away from advanced topics. The chapter on exception handling is a real knockout. At the end the pieces are all drawn together to help you master the use of C#.net in web applications."
3,Good listening,"I liked the originality of the effort, the recording and sound engineering. The tunes and other stuff are more routine. It is worth a buy if you are interested in having an Indian instrument based composition with a fusion of Western influence. Couple of songs are really good."
3,Not happry with one of units,"I recieved 2 units, and installed one of them in our radio studio. CD #1 will not play all CD's and it sometimes will not cue using the shuttle knob."
1,Returned Stanton,"This was a mistake. It was returned, and I believe my account was reimbursed.I HOPE!>"
2,Didn't enjoy the book as much as I thought I would,"The 1960 NFL Championship Game between the Packers and Eagles was the first title game that I ever saw in color. I still remember that day and the game to this day. I was rooting for the Packers.I enjoyed the bio summaries on Tim Brown, Ted Dean, and a few of the other Eagles. Unfortunately though the book was too much quoting of former Eagles and not enough narrative by the author. I didn't know that the Eagles were originally called the Yellow Jackets.An huge Eagles fan of that era may enjoy the book more than I did, but I still don't think the book would merit more than 3*."
4,Good Value for Money,"Goods:1. Easy to use2. 6-8 hours runtime on battery which is higher than most others I researched.3. Features matching with models almost $ 200 more expensive.Not so goods:1. Maps not upto date. Atleast 3 times in as many months that I have been using this, the GPS got confused.2. Voice directions commands are not natural and not very clear. Especially long names.3. Cannot listen to music while showing directions.4. Doesn't work well in downtowns near tall buildings."
2,Magellan Road Mate,"Good product but, takes too long to find the satellite and calculate route.If I was given the choice again I would have purchased a Garmin."
2,2200t,I've had this product 3 months. It would be a good product to get you from an airport to most addresses. I bought it for local use and found that about a third of the time it did not have the roads I was looking for. One time it sent me in the opposite direction I needed to go! There web sight had no updates even though this model had been out for well over a year.
2,Doesn't really have crossover maps,"Like another reviewer, I bought this several months ago based on the promise of crossover maps. I'm beginning to doubt that Magellan has any intention of ever providing them.It does okay on the road, but I had hoped for something that would eliminate the need for two units. I would not recommend just because I don't feel comfortable recommending a product from a company I can't trust."
1,Not As Advertised,"I purchased this unit in early December of 2006, based on the promise and news release from Magellan that the unit could be upgraded to a Crossover unit that I could also use offroad on my ATV. The Crossover 2500 (which does both of these functions) had not been released at that point, so I purchased this 2200T unit based on Magellan's promises. It is now almost eight months later, and still no upgrades are available. Magellan's poor Customer Service Dept. keeps making false promises as to a release date and they have now removed almost all mention of the upgrade from their advertising. If I wanted an on-road only GPS unit I would have purchased a Garmin. Think twice before buying this unit...!!!"
2,Magellan Roadmate 2200t,"Don't buy unless you like outdated roadmaps and poor customer service. Magellan apparently doesn't plan on providing parts for their products. The cradle broke right after I purchased the unit, I went to their website and ordered a replacement. I have been waiting over a month now, I have had contact with service dept. twice, but was a waste of my time. The part is on backorder with status of 'availabilty unknown'. You either hold it in your hand or lay it down to use it. I have a Nuvi 350 that is much better, and the maps are excellent ."
1,Never again!!!!,"I purchased this item about a month ago and had to return it. The unit worked well for two days, then it started acting up. It constantly froze up and had to be reset. When it did stay on it kept rebooting itself for no apparent reason. The POI database is very limited. I just purchased the Nuvi 350, i hope i have a better story to tell about that one."
1,Not worth its price,"I moved to a new town, thinking that with Magellan GPS getting around will become easier. The unit is useless in remote areas. I have used it for a few days and it is a complete flop. Absolute wrong directions. From one point to another the unit freezes again and again and gives wrong directions.The maps and direction are inaccurate. Needs improvement. Does not meet expectations. Buy it from ebay and forget about getting back your money."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"I purchased this Because of Price and learned that going cheaper isn't allways better. I used it three times and now the unit won't even turn on. I've called customer service and get some guy in India who I could barely understand. It's not worth the hassle, Just spend the money on a Garmin.I saw some reviews where they were satisfied with there Magellin.I have nothing good to say about it and won't purchase another magellin product."
2,I dont recommend,i bought the 2200t and returned it after 2 days. it froze on me a few times while in route. The POI database is horrible. I live in the suburbs of a big city and it couldn't find common places for 100 miles. It was very frustrating. I then bought a garmin and have been very satisfied for the past week.
4,No home address.,"Doesnt locate my home address, although in been there for 6 yrs. Instructions very vague at first use, you have to use allot of trial & error."
4,MAGELLAN ROADMATE 2200T,So far so good. Display is easy to see. Directions are easy to follow. Points of interest are sometimes difficult to access.
1,Disapionted,"I was disapointed in the product that I recieved, the Magellan RoadMate 2200T. I did not recieve a car charger nor a home charger for it. Therefor, I do not know if this product works. I've called around my area for a charger and was told that this item is not sold any more. I feel this was a waist of my hard earnd money and if I am not satisfied I will never use this product again and a will advise others not to use it, or any other that may sold by this company, as well. If you have and questions or concerns I can be reached at 254 245 8241."
4,Magellan,I am very happy with my GPS system. I am the type of person who never knows where I am going and that doesn't bother me. But when it comes time to go home I want to get there quickly. My GPS helps me get home.
1,No Manual,"Regardless of what you think of the electronics, consider for a moment that you are about to spend several hundred dollars on a relatively complicated piece of electronic equipment that has several menu layers. Perhaps, the manufacturer would like you to believe that you don't need a manual, but my position is that it should be YOUR choice. As a consumer, if you buy a piece of electronics you have a reasonable right to expect a manual.Should you talk the time to call support, they will tell you they are sorry and send you to the website to print one. Of course, you better have a color laser printer, as it is 56 pages. Then should you want to keep it in your car where it could actually provide value, please keep in mind that that is 56 pages on 8"" x 11"" paper.Very disappointing that they felt the need to cut corners in this way."
4,Great GPS,"I have used this GPS (Roadmate 2200T)for about 4 weeks, it has done everything that Magellan said it would do. The voice is clear and loud. The only thing that I would like the GPS to have is a recall button, sometimes when my wife and are talking, I would miss the first part of the announcement. I guess It really isn't that bad, all you have to do is look at the screen to see your location-The really nice thing about this GPS is that you don't have to look at the screen,(unless you miss the announcement) the announcement has good enough instructions to keep you going in the right direction."
2,Magellan Customer Service abysmal,"I purchased this unit, and it worked well for 2 weeks. Then, problems required the unit to be sent back for repairs.Since then I have been on calls with Magellan's Chennai (India) repair call center five (!) times, and after 6 weeks I still have no unit, nor is the repair center able to tell me when to expect it back. Another call today revealed their entire computer system being down, and no status information being available until the ""system is back up - but we don't know when"".If you even *think* that you might need customer support, do not buy Magellan."
1,Boring in 10 minutes,"This games graphics are possibly the best I have ever seen. Unfortunately good graphics dont make a good game. This one dimensional game loses interest after ten minutes. There is no real goal except for the mini games. If you like depth in a game, dont get this."
4,"Fun, but not at a price!","This is a fun game. Don't get me wrong. I was so anxious to get this game for so long.. I have to say that it is not a game that I would spend more than ... on. The gameplay is repetitive, and there is only 1 level.Have I missed something? I think not..The game has excellent sound and graphics, but fails deliver anything more than the same thing over and over.The physics on the game are not that good.Anyone thinking about buying this game should borrow it from a friend or rent it from your local video store before making the final purchase. It was fun, but not .... worth of fun."
4,"Good Game, but Lacking","I think this game is great. However, there were things that I wish the game had. For example, another city. Now it is possible that because I haven't finished the game, or entered a code, another city hasn't been unlocked. Although, I don't believe this is the case. The fact there is only one city, does make the replay value slighty low.The ""crazy box"" is a nice, challenging feature to the game. The 1-S level, is extremely difficult in the beginning, especially if you haven't mastered the crazy drift. The arcade and orginal modes are also a positive add on.Overall, I think any Dreamcast owner should get the game, even if you think you won't like it. Trust me, the game is very addicting."
3,Fun for a bit but now collects dust.,"This game is fun. I personally bought it because of all the rave reviews I saw on the net about how great this game is. Well, I DID buy it and DID play it and I LIKED it. The only problem is that it doesn't change much and I just find the game very repetitive after a good 10 minutes (I guess thats why there is a 3 minute game option). I guess this game doesn't fall into any certain genre. I can't call it a racing game and it's not very strategic. My suggestions, rent it for a few days. If you can't live without it after those few days, buy it."
5,Crazy Taxi:My Review,"I think this video game is very good.I like the graphics on all sega dreamcast games,but the graphics on crazy taxi were way cooler.I also thought that the realism was unsurpassed.In short this video game is definitely going to be on my christmas list this year."
1,Crazy Taxi...ummmm...Save your money,"Game was great for an hour. With the top limit of a 10 minute game no matter how well your doing. Lets face it racing around crashing into anything and everything gets a bit boring fast...I think Crazy Taxi needs to be put in the garage and taken out when you need to entertain a group of 11 year olds. What is really bad is the graphics are wonderful but the objective of the game is simplistic and overall unsatisfying. Dream Cast has a great potentential, do yourself a favor and pass on this one, unless your under 13."
2,diminishing returns,"The first hour I played it, it was fantastic! Then it just got really old really fast. The same two cities everytime. Slow down in graphics when there is too much traffic. Twisted Metal on the play station is a much more fun car-game."
5,Who is the Master of Crazy Taxi?,"This game is so much fun. I cannot tell you the countless hours my roomate and I have played this game! It does tend to get a bit boring after playing it to death, but the Crazy Box levels (think mini-games) keep the challenge going, as you try to complete them and unlock even more levels. I reccomend getting a steering wheel too- not that it makes it easier, but that it makes it much more fun!"
3,ahh,this game is pretty much the same thing as the arcade version yawn.In fact there is nothing different about the dreamcast version or the arcade version.It was fun in the arcade but anybody who has played crazy taxi in the arcade will find the dreamcast version very boring.For people who have not played crazy taxi at the arcade i would strongly reccomend it but only in that situation.
3,Sorta Fun,"This game is fun in the beginning but it quickly becomes boring, what with only two tracks and a limited number of cars to drive. If you are into sim racing such as Formula 1, or GT this title may put you to sleep."
3,"It's the fun factor, not the depth...","Crazy Taxi is one of the most enjoyable and remarkable games currently on the market. The graphics are cutting edge and it is simply fun to play. The area where crazy taxi lacks in is depth. You will easily complete the trial missions(Crazy Box) and your only other option is to play the original or arcade modes which offer no rewards for completion. Also, there is no actual goal for completing the game and when you get tired of playing the arcade mode just for ""fun"", you will have nothing left except for a plastic dust collector. I recommend this game for people new to the DC or who are just looking for something to pass the time until Resident Evil:CV comes out."
3,"Good game,for a while","This was the second game I bought for Dreamcast, and it was fun for a while. But it got boring. There are three game modes. Arcade, original, and crazy box. Arcade is the level from the arcade, original is one level made just for the Dreamcast, and crazy box is some mini games. When you beat arcade and original nothing happens, it just says game over, and that is basically the end of the game. Once you beat crazy box,there is nothing else to really do after that except keep playing the arcade and original modes again. Which is no different. So this game gets kind of boring, unless you play it with your friends. I'd recomend this game to people who have a lot of parties or a lot of kids over."
5,this game is unreal,I love this game. It has smooth and fast gameplay. Anyone can play it and like it. Even my mom and my girlfriend will play. If you liked the arcade version this is a must buy because it looks exactly the same.
2,Am I the only one that finds this game boring?,"While I agree with the other reviews that Crazy Taxi has excellent visual appeal, I find the game gets old very quickly. How many times can you drive variations on the same person to KFC? I think the game could have used some additional features. First, your taxi should be able to sustain damage. There is no penalty for driving head-on into a semi other than a slight delay. Second, the taxi should have an ejection seat to get rid of unwanted fares. Many of the fares are picked up on accident when arriving at a destination. Finally, there should be cities other than the San Francisco knockoff. The repetition in this game was very disappointing. While I don't think Crazy Taxi is a terrible game, I would simply suggest you play the game before you buy it. I bought this game without playing it first and was very disappointed; I hope this review prevents the same from happening to you."
2,Redundant play,"Once you play the first scene, all others are the same. You have the same type of customers and the same moves within the cities. I got bored after 30 minutes of play. The only highlight of the game were the soundtrack from hit bands, The Offsprings and Bad Religion. One of the bad games Sega had made."
2,game gets old quick,"this game is fun at first, but quickly proceeds to being boring! i'd rather play grand theft auto for a good system, that way you can have the same amount of fun as you do with crazy taxi (you can be a taxi driver in GTA3)!"
3,CRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZZZZZYYYYYYY TAXI !,"This game rocks! Don't take the 3 star rating as a bad thing. I gave it 3 stars for a reason. Now let's start with the pros first. This game is plain fun. You go around and find costumers to get some bucks. Boring? Not exactly. It's auctually really crazy. You gotta get to your destination really quick. To get there in such a short time you gotta smash in to other cars, jump ramps, and go through a one way street. You basically brake every traffic law! Now to the cons. First of all is that the game's too easy. There is no challenge. Plus there are several pop ups and the occasional slow down. But that's not what's annoying me. It's the point that the game is good in the first hour but get's boring afterwards. It's like a one time game. Plus there isn't viarity. You only get 2 cities and it's a one player game so don't get it if you want a multi player game. Overall you should only buy this game if you have a lot of parties or are bad at games."
3,its ok...,"The Sega Dreamcast version of the classic arcade game hasmoremodes which is good. It does get boring really quickly though. It has no point. All you do is drive people places. I reccomend just renting the game and trying it. It has great graphics and realistic gameplay, and if you want you can cruise around and hit cars and people and knock them over. WARNING: Rent before you buy."
4,hey hey its crazy taxi,After playing the arcade version several times I decided with no doubt to get this game. Good Choice. YES! Great game with funny characters and great visusals. Many of the mini games are fun to. Even though the game may get boring it is still great . Multiplayer races would've been nice though. For 20 bucks this is a must own.
4,SOME CRAZY FUN,"this game is really good.the only draw back is it is fairly short.at 20 bucks,its a must have."
4,"Awesome gameplay, great graphics, and a good story","In Crazy Taxi, you play as 1 of 4 characters. Drive through a variety of scenery such as different cities and oceans, this is a must-have Dreamcast game! Crazy Taxi has great graphics and a funny story line that everyone will enjoy. This is an excellent party game..."
3,Alright.......Less than expected.,"Well, it was okay, it just wasn't exactly up to my expectations. There's really nothing wrong with it, but it really is just a arcade game put onto the dreamcast, and nothing more. I just was really expecting like a career mode, like in tony hawk pro skater. So, there's not really anything wrong, it just falls short of my standards. If all you want is not to have to go to the arcade and spend 20 quarters just for a half an hour worth of fun, then go ahead and buy it. But otherwise, I wouldn't recemend it.-The Iron Monkey"
2,Lotsa fun for about a half an hour...,"This game is fun, but after you've got the gist, that's all folks! I will try other's suggestions to play it at a party - but I don't play it by myself anymore."
2,Gets old Fast!,This game looks awesome but should have been left at the arcades. The game is fun for 30 min but after you've driven all over the city two or three times it gets old fast. At best rent the game for a day and I'm sure you'll feel the same way. But if you just want a game to impress your buddies with and have lots of extra cash get it!
5,"If you don't have a Dreamcast, this is a reason 2 get 1!","This has to be THE greatest racing/arcade game ever and I hope it will be ported over to NGPC. The graphics are great, with only a little slowdown here and there, also some pop-up is encountered (especially in Original mode). The sound is great with people yelling 'WATCH IT YOU IDIOT!' when you're screamin' down the road. The soundtrack is great (if repetitive) and you'll be singin' along 'ya ya ya ya ya' in no time. The Offspring and Bad Religion provide some of their greatest 'skate rock' tunes for the game. This game has 2 cities, one being the arcade and another a totally original city. The 'Mirror Mode' provides skewed cities for a (technical) total of 4 cities. Overall, this game is a must buy for the quarter pumpin' fans of the arcade version! P.S.: this game is NOT just a 11 yr. old example like one reviewer said."
4,"It's fun, but I can only get so far...","Admittedly I'm not very good at these games, however I love to drive so this game was right up my alley!! It's fun and for me it took me a while to learn all of the tricks (I don't know them all either.) I have the strategy book, which was of no help. Well the book did have the map of the city.Anyway, if you like wild driving you'll like this. I figure everyone has this classic title so no need in convincing you to get it. Just get it (...)Crazy Taxi 2 has different drivers and a different city. Same fun though."
2,Crazy Taxi Is Not So Good,If you are thinking about buying the game change your mind!!!!! It might seem fun at first but after the first couple of months it's going to be boring.I bought this game because I was intrested and today it's collecting dust.There goes ten dollars down the drain.So take my advice and don't buy the game.
2,DISSAPOINTMENT,THIS IS A GREAT GAME IF U PLAN ON PLAYING IT FOR 10 MINUTES. THIS GAME GETS VERY VERY BORING VERY VERY QUICK. I DONT RECOMEND BUYING THIS ... CUZ THERES NO ONLINE OR MULTI-PLAYER GAMEPLAY. BOOOOOOOOOOOO. I ONLY RECOMEND BUYING THIS GAME IF UR 9 YEARS OLD. (MAYEB IT WONT GET AS BORING AS FAST)... ( I WOULDVE GAVE IT 2 STARS BUT MY GIRL LIKES IT SO I GOTTA GIVE IT SOME CREDIT)
1,D@mn confusing,"I'm a New Yorker, and this book made simple trips seem complicated. I recommend the free map from Downtown Alliance; see downtownnewyork.com. If you're planning a trip to new york, there are dozens of other great free maps--including the very complete one available at any metro station."
3,S'alright,"The problem with J. Niimi's Murmur of the great 33 1/3rd series of books about specific albums, is that it's ironic. Unlike Murmur, which is more a landscape of words set to another landscape built by music, Niimi gets all academic and a bit bloated when attempting to look in-depth at R.E.M.'s first full-length album. In a chapter on lyrics, Niimi criticizes those who try to analyze Michael Stipe's lyrics, and spends pages upon pages criticizing two critics who did. This makes me wonder if all that stuff we're introduced to regarding Southern Gothic and the influence of the New South on R.E.M. holds true.Like the rest of the 33 1/3 series, the best part of the book comes when Niimi tries to reconstruct the making of the album. Other than that, Murmur is a high-falootin' college paper. Not bad, just not my style."
1,mer rumrum,its difficult to appreciate a book written in the style of no-wave dadfa enhanced mutuality before the settlement of refugees.
1,"Sorry folks, too pretentious for rock and roll","This, to me, is the weakest in the great 33 1/3 series that I have read. While the author is certainly knowledgable and learned, the prose is thick and I found myself skimming through long passages. This album was a seminal one for me as well (although I was slightly older than the author at time of release) and so while my interest in the topic was very high, I didn't feel this book added anything to my appreciation of it, other than some interesting sequences regarding recording details. I believe that rock and roll can be written about from a serious and analytical point of view, but this reads like a bad thesis from a general studies major."
4,good reference for intermediate user.,"This is a very good tutorial that covers a wide array of topics in Java. It has excellent audio and video quality. It covers from simple ""Hello World"" application to advanced topics such as JDBC and advanced syntax. However, the structure of the topics is not well designed for the beginner. I like it because I am in an intermediate level in Java programming and everything seems very clear to me. Still, it would be a little difficult for a beginner in Java to learn Java from this tutorial. I highly recommend this tutorial for any intermediate student who wants a brush up in Java."
2,No new features from 1.5,I want to learn just the basics of Java 1.5 Tiger version.Thought it covers the basis 1.2 only not any new features from Java 1.5 version.I like the Author Neil Ford and I do own his books/DVD on JSP and Art of Web Development which are really good enough.This is also good one but not really fair to call as Java 1.5 may be say Learn java 1.2 features using Java 1.5 jre.So if you are looking for Java 1.5 features dont waste your money on this..
2,! This shouldn't be what we getting for 30 Dollars !,I recently purchased java jsp VB xml c# ASP xml.* The Sound quality is terible. They used a very cheap mic. instead of using a directional mic. I hope they will test next time before they release new dvd.* The examples are hard to see on the screen because recording was not clear from their computer.* The content is nice and it covers most details.* It's always good to hear from another instructor.* I recommend you to use headphones if you watch these dvds.
5,A Civil Law approach with a universal flavor,"Throughout the pages of this wonderful work, the author gives a thorough picture of the subject of contract rescission and resolution. Belgian law is scrutinezed, and reference to French and other legal systems are made. The work, devoted to a modern topic of economic contract law, makes useful reading for any professional working or doing academic research on the field, and can easily be understood in its clear french. Most of the proposed doctrines will be applicable to any Civil Law based country, and will certainly show an insightful view on the subject for the common law user. For this reason, the work may be clasified as universal"
5,God heard our cry and answered in this book Sex traps,"was written clean, honest and down to earth authors' motives seem to be to help others. Book was just another reminder that god hears the cry of his children. A wise way to give to love ones is to present it as a gift. She said things in the book that pastors ought to be saying but don't"
3,Sex Traps,"Anyone who is dating, thinking about dating, or been in a sex trap must read this book. Dr. Davis-Turner was candid as only she can be in outlining the old tricks that satan uses to bait us. He cannot come up with anything new because he has been relegated to that which is common to man. She talked about our passions are good but what we do with our passions makes it evil or bad. One thing that stood out was that most sex traps are not about sex, but is orchestrated by the devil to destroy your relationship with God. The devil knows when we are wounded and vulnerable and sets us up with a match from hell to wear you down until you give in then steal your strength and pluck your eyes out so you have no spiritual discernment. This book helps you to identify traps and stresses that if you cannot get the trap away from you, get away from it. Read this book and be set free and stay free."
2,Kind of overblown and a bit paranoid.,"I think the author has had very bad experiences with some of the women in her church and so she now thinks every woman is out to get her man and lay a sex trap. This book was amusing and it's mercifully short but like someone else has previously said, it's not that bad in the church where people are constantly devising sex traps for eachother. And what about the men? She seems to place a ton of responsibility on the women alone. Why am I not surprised?"
3,LANGUAGE WAS A BIT OFF BUT WRITTEN OKAY,"I understand the point the writer was trying to make, but some of the language she used, was not suitable for her potential audience, or should I say would not be familiar to her audience. I suggest she use a ghost writer who is more in touch the audience she is trying to reach. The end result though is that the reader can tell the writers means what she says and cares about the message even if the language is out of date."
1,Not a good example of Gregorian Chant,"Having studied and sung chant for several years, I would not recommend this CD. Although Gregorian Chant can be a rather interpretive style of singing, this is by far one of the more unusual interpretations I have encountered. It throws most of the rules of chant out the window regarding pace. This is clearly a CD for a performance and not a Chant for prayer or meditation. The only way I can describe it is ""bouncy,"" which completely ruins the sanctity of the music."
4,believe the hype,"This is an awesome album. The guitars of TV Sky and Only Heaven are almost all gone, in favor of heavier electro-industrial beats. The electronics are really tight, and the production is as good or better than any of their other albums. In a perfect world, you would hear ""Lucidogen"" or ""Supersonic"" on the radio. Also, Ipecac Records will soon be releasing this in the US, so it might be in the stores and cheaper soon."
2,mere mortals,"A bit disappointing. The Young Gods used to be at least five years ahead of everybody else. They were so far ahead of the game they appear to have lost their way somewhat. This new album is very techno but lacks good tunes. Everything sounds over-processed and stilted. It is also very badly mastered, my tip is to play it twice as loud as normal to get some decent noise out of it. I saw them play it live in London last week and it sounded much better but still very pale against the earlier material."
1,I'm glad Slow Food doesn't taste this bland,"I wish I could say this book was a good effort, but the fact that it's cut and spliced from various articles makes it a very disjointed reading experience. Also, the writing is just plain bad and dull-- some of it is unreadable-- lots of grammar errors.It doesn't seem to be put together in any type of coherent sequence.If you want to actually be inspired into looking deeper at the slow food movement, I would high recommend any book my Michael Pollan, esp ""The Omnivore's Dilemma."""
5,Starting a revolution through the pleasures of the table,'Slow Food' explains the philosophy of eating well and of buying local. Philosopher/Gourmet Carlo Petrini explains the unique movement he created in Italyu that has now become a global phenomenon. this book is a great read for gourmets and people interested in food's role in their society.
1,unfortunatley not what i expected,i was looking for a book about slowfood and of course with some traditional receipts. unfortunatley there is'nt any picture and receipts in that book.
4,"Corner Blitz, a good one",I think this pair of shoes is real good to begin to play football o softball. I recommed as a good one.
4,Good book but short,"The booklet had the type of problems which I was looking for my 7 year old, however it is too short. By the time I got home, he completed all but several pages. The problems are good, but it should have more problems, and it should be increasingly more difficult."
3,It's hard than it sounds,"It's not an easy language but I found myself knowing quite a lot of manadarin after listening to these CD's. You need to listen to them over and over for the language to take hold. I was disappointed that it is made for the US market so I was constantly forced to say ""I am American"" in Mandarin. They don't even give you the word for ""Canadian"". That was a big annoyance. I could have used more practice converting Mandarin to English and not just the other way around. While I could structure a sentence it did not develop my listening skills at all."
5,amazing.,as awsome as this CD is he is 5 times better live. Take this CD home but definetly go out to see him. it's beyond worth it.
5,Wow and WOW,"I am not a huge fan of tenors, and Scott's falsetto is frequently so high as to boarder on soprano but WOW, what a beautiful album this is. It was a nice surprise to find that I enjoyed this album as much as I did.His song selection is quirky and fun. The perfect blend of familiar and obscure. His musical styling is unique giving the songs a personal twist and making even 'Cry Me A River' and "" My Foolish Heart' seem fresh. If 'Maybe You Didn't Hear Me' doesn't bring a tear to your eye then you have no soul. And 'Cry Without A Reason', a sometime staple of cabaret acts, has rarely been done this sweetly. The medley of 'Just Around The Riverbend' and 'Corner of the Sky', is fun and fresh, and the vocal arrangement on Nobody's Side ( a long time personal favorite ) is wonderful. I've had a hard time turning this album off since I got it. I really loved this album."
5,The Voice of an Angel,"Scott Coulter truly has the voice of an angel. Everything on the cd builds until finally climaxing with ""It Goes Like it Goes."" Actually, between ""Cry Me a River"" and ""It Goes Like It Goes"" I thought my head would explode.(This is a good thing) There aren't enough male singers like him. Wait till you hear him. Yea Scott!"
1,Tenor Histrionics,"Good Grief! The music for Stephen Schwartz's In Whatever Time We Have is marked ""flowing, with simplicity and sincerity"", but those qualities are incredibly lacking in this recording. Not only is Coulter's interpretation way over the top, but his tone is nasal, and his vocal technique and musical style are so poor that they distract the listener from the beauty of the words and music. He should listen to John Rubenstein's interpretations of With You and Corner of the Sky from the original recording of Pippin. I'm sorry I don't agree with Stephen Schwartz, whose music I love, but I would pay this guy NOT to sing."
2,Not my favorite,"Unfortunately, I believe this CD is an example of a trend in cabaret recordings. It has become possible to create a CD with a minimal amount of expense and production, so many vocalists are able to put out CDs that could not have before, without the benefit of a major label to ensure quality.This also means that the average cabaret fan can sift through a lot of albums to find the good ones. For me, this was not one.I was impressed to see that Stephen Schwartz had played on some of these songs, but the true test of a singer and any vocal performance CD is the quality of their voice. There is a nasal tone to Scott Coulter that I just can't get past, even though I tried. The choices of songs are all good (Nobody's Side and Get Here are examples of really good songs), and this definitely tempts you, but the results are consistently not as good as interpretations found of the same material elsewhere."
1,What a nasally and annoying voice,"Wow, am I sorry I bought this CD! Scott Coulter has one of the whiniest male voices I've ever heard. He swoops, up and down, vocally, and often for no reason, like a ''Star Search'' reject. This guy can make pretty noises, but Coulter has no sense of what he's singing. He also should've printed the lyrics to the songs, because I can't make out the words on most of them. The phrasing is self-conscious and overwrought. The songs are mostly draggy ballads. One wailing number sounds like another. ''Cry Without a Reason.'' ''Cry Me a River.'' And on and on. There's a song on the CD called ''Maybe You Didn't Hear Me.'' After listening to this album, I only WISH I hadn't heard it."
3,Consider a 64MB or 128MB SmartMedia Instead,"Don't buy this card until you have weighed the options of purchasing a 64MB and 128MB SmartMedia card first.Here are the reasons to purchase a larger card:1. Price. A larger card is less expensive per megabyte. For example, the Viking 128MB card is currently ... cheaper than buying 4 of these SanDisk cards. The 64MB card is about ... cheaper.2. Future proof. In the technology sector it is always better to purchase for tomorrow. You can be rest assured that some new fangled device or service will need you to have a larger storage capacity. Simply look at the way digital cameras are going. Each release the Megapixel rate increases and thus so does each images file size.3. Convenience. You will not want to be carrying around 2-4 smaller cards when you could be just carrying around one (which you aren't really carrying around because it is in your device).Just take a look at the options, weigh the advantages and disadvantages, then make your decision."
3,Good Pricing But Not the Best,"Amazon has a great price on this SanDisk card (the lowest I have seen). In fact I almost bought it when I noticed that the Viking 32 MB 3.3 Volt SmartMedia Card is about 20% less. I decided to order them both and then just return the one I didn't want--sorry Amazon but I just couldn't make up my mind.I discovered that the cards are identical (except for the little SanDisk/Viking label). Needless to say, even though the card worked wonderfully, I returned the SanDisk card and kept the Viking."
2,Not Worth It...,We bought this machine after having the best ever Mango Daiquiri at a restaurant. They used a similar machine but it was commercial quality. This Margarita Frozen Concoction Maker just didn't cut it. It leaves chunky ice in the drinks and not totally smooth like the one we had at the restaurant. Now we have a Vitamix and there is NO COMPARISON in the quality of drinks you can make. We now get the SMOOTH drink quality just like the restaurant. Don't waste your money on this. Put it towards a Vitamix and then you can make anything under the sun... It will amaze you!!! Might seem like a LOT of money but it's worth every penny. The Margarita Frozen Concoction Maker is like a wana be Vitamix... NOT!!!
4,Sanyo 7300 Replacement Battery,"This is the second battery of this type for the same phone that I have purchased thru Amazon. This battery does not seem to perform as well as the first battery. It does not seem to have the same talk time or duration as the previous battery. I bought the second because I loved the first one, it was strong and had lasting power for an older phone. Not sure if it's the batteries fault or the age of the phone. It does charge quickly and does work so I'm not unhappy with it. I will probably purchase another one when this one goes bad."
5,Only If You're Serious About The Truth,This book is for people who are open to the truth about church history and how it has been transformed into what the church has become today with the help of schemers and deceivers.
1,I'll be more careful,"I had to throw out this book when I beganbeing sick reading it. It has one of themost twisted concepts of God that I haveseen in a supposedly bible oriented book.The author is some sort of hyper-CalvinistI suppose. His God does not love all mankind,rather only some of mankind. Ugh!"
2,Don't bother,"Bent the first time I used it. Had hoped to have this as a viable option for small areas instead of firing up the weed trimmer with the edger attachment. Definitely not worth the money, but good idea if it had been more durable."
3,Uneven,"Allister Sparks wrote a brilliant book, ""Tomorrow Is Another Country"" and decent sections in two other books (this one and ""Mind of South Africa""). My problem with this one is that it is uneven in quality, oddly organized, and not straight narrative history. Some chapters, like the one about the formation of economic policy, are as good as anything written about South Africa. Others, like the one about print journalism and the SABC are wandering affairs of editorial commentary. The structure of the book isn't logical as the chapters don't lead into one another or create a whole story. Moreover, Sparks has an annoying habit of inserting himself into stories or situations by providing his own anecdotes or thoughts on the events.This ultimately is a good book, but not a great one. The best post-1994 book on South Africa probably is Ale Russell's ""Bring Me My Machine Gun."""
1,Very disappointing.....,"No matter how little you pay for this dvd, you will probably conclude that it was too much. That's how I feel, and I only paid about $5.00, including shipping. It looks like someone went out with their camcorder & took some shots. VERY amateurish!!"
2,Marlon Brando movie set,"The main movie disc for The Mutiny on the Bounty doesn't work, the secondary disc does. I wrote to ask for a replacement disc, was told none is available. Very disappointing. The other discs are in good condition. Not happy about the bad disc, that movie is why I bought the set."
4,Brando retrospective,A good sampling of Marlon Brando's movie career. Everything from a classic Mutiny on The Bounty to the quirky Reflections In A Golden Eye. Great selection for Brando-philes.
5,The Marlon Brando Collection,"An amazing set of films that I have been waiting for on DVD for a number of years. I think Julius Caesar, Reflections in a Golden Eye, The Teahouse of the August Moon and the Formula are all first time on DVD. Altough thes are not Brando at his very best, they are most important in showing the wide range of roles he could play. The whole set is very well presented and I would recommend the set, not just to Brando completists, but also to those who only know him from his more famous roles, The Godfather, On the Waterfront. The man will be sorely missed and this set goes a long way to showing what a great actor he was. There are not many 'film stars' around today who could hold a candle to him. A wondeful tribute!!"
1,Defective disk,"While the other disks load & play ok, the disk for ""Reflections in a Golden Eye"" will not load into my blu-ray player, my regular dvd player, my stand-alone dvd-burner -- or even my PC! It is most definitely defective-- but I'm just shafted because sending the whole lot back could net me other defective disks as another customer has pointed out!"
3,Mixed Bag,"I purchased the set for Reflections, Mutiny, and Caesar so I am not disappointed. However Teahouse is anunwatchable embarrassment. It may have worked on stage, however on film it is torture, and Brando as an Asian is beyond the limits of credulity. Abysmal was a capital A."
1,1st delivery defective - re-order also defective,Both teahouse & Mutiny would not play. Amazon is great to order from for my money was quickly returned.
3,shocked,Didn't like the fact that Teahouse of the August moon portrayed the Japanese as uncivilized people...particularly Brando's character perpetuated this idea and it was not amusing.the other dvds were ok
5,I'd Add This if You're Building a Celtic Music Collection,"When Grace Griffith sings, it sounds like a lullaby. Her voice is as pleasant as a breeze blowing by.This is a modern Celtic album - more Scottish-styled than Irish I would say. It includes mainly ballads and gentle jigs. It even includes a Loreeena McKennitt piece, All Souls Night, which was very dangerous because nobody can do it like Loreena! But they pulled off the piece in the style of the group's personality - breezy and pretty. And it worked.But my favorite song on the album was My Heart's in the Highlands because it exemplifies what's really neat about this CD. It's a lovely ballad that just flows along and lets you feel the cool mountain breeze in your hair. Like the rest of the album, it's simple and pretty and really transports you to Celtic Isles.This is a pretty CD to add to your Celtic music collection."
3,"Awesome graphics, but little things lacking","First off, this game is visually amazing. The graphics and sound are great, as is the majority of the game play. I do have some minor problems with it. First of all, you can't play a shortened season. I have to play all 82 games to get to the playoffs. 2nd, where are the injuries? If I'm playing a full season, I would expect there to be some injuries during the year. 3rd - why can't I compare my teams stats vs. the rest of the league? In NFL2K, I can see leaders in all of the statistical categories but not in this game. 4th - there are no fights! I know the game says it has them, but I've yet to be in one. I've broken the glass every other game but haven't seen a fight.I hope they get these things fixed in the next version. I still love to play it, just not as much as I loved playing NFL2K (and I like hockey better). Oh yeah, one more thing, why isn't the game rumble pack compatible? It would seem like a perfect fit. Oh well."
3,NHL2K--No better than EA's NHL 2000 for PSX,"I am more than disappointed of this game. The graphics are poor for a Dreamcast game, and the gameplay as such is not very realistic. The fast mode, come on! The extras such as season stats are poorly organized and lack the great stats EA offers. The game has quite some flaws, too. Wrong players go to the penalty box, the volume goes up and down, the arenas are not like the real ones at all, the same speaker works at every place, the coaches don't resemble the real ones. Scoring isn't that easy, penalties hardly ever happen since it's impossible to adjust anything like the ref's actions, etc. All in all, NHL2K is the weakest of the three sports games available for Dreamcast. I love hockey, but this game doesn't do our sport any justice. Last but not least, aiming shots is impossible when you play with the overhead cam. That's sad!"
4,Its not as bad as you all say.,"The game just isn't that bad! Ive played every hockey game since Ice hockey for NES and this one is pretty good. The graphics are incredible, the playing is realitic.People complain that its hard to score, have any of you played or watched real hockey? Other hockey games became too easy, I used to win games by 20 or more. Thats fun for one or two games. The bad things about the game are very small, who cares about only using one team per season, and so what the wrong guy goes into the box sometimes, the game play makes up for that. Besides just think about how much better it will be next year. Its hard to compare it to nfl and nba2k, those games are perfection!"
2,Easy Score,"First the graphics are good, the scheduling needs to be where you can make the schedule to fit the year, if you are really into hockey, and the rosters are just a bit off a couple of years.and the scoring is to easy in the All Star mode with all Penalties and a Strict ref, I averaged 16 goals a game,??"
2,Biggest Dissapoinment,"Two words: goal celebration. That is one of the most exciting parts of attending or watching a live nhl game. There isn't even a horn that goes off when the home team scores. I was expecting with all the features they were highlighting that they would at least have realistic goal celebrations. I played this game for a total of 10 minutes, before realizing that it was a huge waste of money. The graphics are good, the announcer and voice over isn't that great, but what are they trying to replicate... EA NHL '92? I think they even got the horn down in that one. :-("
1,this game is horrible,this game is horrible. The graphics are horrible and gameplay (is very poor). only has 3 game modes: exhibition season and playoffs.do not buy this game. it is a waste of money. it will be boring fter you play it a lot. the crowd doesnt do anything or the glass doesnt break. this game (is very bad). If you dont buy it trust me you wont regret it.
3,Wow its a brouser,once there were rivals that drew in big crowds. Now there are video games that bore people and excite people. NHL 2K is not a bad game but it doesn't compare to nfl 2k2 or nba 2k2 or even their respective 2k1. there are no injuries and you can always score the same way. So it is very prodictable. And gets very boring at times.
2,Not good,"I bought this game last February, couldn't wait for it to come out, a huge hockey fan, I was throughly disappointed. The game lacks what hockey is all about, checking, violence, passing and SPEED. The guys skate like they are in maple syrup. One timers are really the only way you can score consistently. The graphics are clean and up to dreamcast standards, however the game play was not. Why no multi- team season mode??? no injuries??? I haven't heard if they are making a NHL 2K1 yet, but I'd definitely rent that one to try out before buying a newest version to see if it's more like hockey. I have played PS2 nhl2001 it is awesome, with so many features, options and settings and a multi-team season mode, and injuries that right now that game is the one to get if you want a fun hockey game with alot of replay value."
2,Disappointing,"The most interesting and best-developed character in this book was the city of San Francisco, the flavors and nuances of which the author captured beautifully. Unfortunately, I found the human characters flat and uninvolving. There is good dialogue and suspense, but also massive coincidences and dangling threads left at the end. I was sadly disappointed in this book."
5,Sumptuous!,Paul Soberg has captured the richness and texture of his subjects so well that at times I felt they were finely illustrated water colored drawings - certainly no one can capture flowers as vividly as Mr. Soberg has managed to do! I am tempted to get a second copy for framing.
5,Undecided,"I do not actually rate this book a five, it was just used to draw your attention. It is pointless to post these two reviews up about this book. How can you decide with such contradicting comments? If you are having trouble ""Reading Comprehension:In Twenty Minutes A Day"" sounds pretty good. I would like someone who has read this to give a serious well-thought out opinion with some detail."
3,"medicore book -- not terrible, but not good.","The reading techniques that you learn in this book will probabliy have no effect on your reading speed. Yet, I think you might gain an infinitesmally small increase in reading comprehension -- but the change would be negligible."
1,garbage,It didn't even last three weeks. Don't waste your money. The 2$ can openers at Walmart will last longer than this $20.00 one.
5,It actually opens cans!,I have been trying for years to find a can opener that would actually open a can! this one does!
1,Worse can opener I've ever used,Out of the dozen can openers I have used in my life. This is the worst. Does not grip the cans properly. Can not smoothly open a can without reapplying the opener several times.
4,"Mellow and moody, deep and soothing...","Nuit create textures and musical moods somewhat akin to Delerium and Enigma. Lyrically, they touch upon deeper and more esoteric subjects. A perfect album to relax to, or perhaps to play under the moonlight while pondering the deeper meanings of life, the universe and everything."
5,This Router\print server works GREAT!,"This makes networking a BREEZE! I unplugged the cable modem, connected an Cat5 cable from the modem to the router, connected the computers to the router, and plugged my printer into the back of the router. Booted up the cable modem. When it was ready, booted up the router. Then booted up the computers. I set up the new printer port on each computer, and in Internet Explorer Unchecked ""automatically detect network settings"" That was it!! 5 computers online with 576kbs download times, all printing to one printer without all the ""sharing"" set up hastles!I highly recommend this for anyone!"
4,SMC SMC7008BR Cable/DSL Router w/8 Port Switch,"This is a great NAT Router. I will not bore you with repeating all the tech specs, but the install was quick and easy. The chassis is made of metal, and uses a standard PC power cable. (Yep, you don't need an special power adapter). It has a nice large power switch on the rear also. The only problem I had was installing a HP DeskJet 722c printer. The problem is caused by the HP drivers. HP specifically writes drivers so that one must purchase a JetDirect box to network thier low-end printers. Turned out that I had to use 10.1 drivers instead of the 10.3 to workaround this problem. All in all this is a great product that deserves a five star rating."
3,Outdated but still useful--worth it for radio addicts,"RADIO ON WHEELS is now nine years old and many of its listed radio stations have changed formats. But I like the way the book is laid out--it clumps metro area to metro area along the Interstate highways, allowing you to tune from one city to the next. It also lists powerful clear-channel AM stations, which any long-haul vagabond can tell you are priceless at night.I'd suggest buying the book if you can still find it because although the FORMATS may have changed, the FREQUENCIES haven't, and that can give you an added safety and convenience factor if you're trying to drive and tune. And don't miss the book's sure-fire tips for locating NPR outlets!charless@ync.net"
3,"Good account, but not enough perspective and philosophy","Good account of the initial theory. Too much personal references to the author of the theory. One can also regreat some insufficient references to Linde and its chaotic inflation theory, as well as the lack of philosophical interest of the author, at least in this book. Overall, I still enjoyed this book and it opened to me some new horizons."
5,One of the Best teachers!,Guth is one the best teacher i have ever read. he walks you thru the book as a story of history. Wonderful!
4,good book with lots of technical details,"A good book on Inflation Theory and a history of its development. I also like the book for its insights into the life of a Physicist. After reading this book I was glad that I didn't pursue Physics into Graduate School. The competition is very tight for a few academic positions. The book was very good at keeping a good amount of detail without the usual math free explanations that ruin books for the scientifically minded. A good follow-up to ""The First Three Minutes"" and ""A brief History of Time""."
3,Not for the uninitiated,"As an ""insiders view"" of perhaps the most significant cosmological discovery since the Red Shift, I, personally found the process of discovery as described in this book a bit dull. This is no reflection on the author, but rather the tedious nature of the day to day work in a highly abstract field. I suspect that the real excitement is in doing the math. Inflationary theory is something that I, a non-scientist, do very much want to understand on a more intuitive level, but this book left me a bit confused. Although I am very glad to have read it ( I suspect it will become important and essential reading for many) I am left looking avidly for further explanation. Any other recommendations out there?"
4,An Expensive Essential,"I bought this to complement theSafety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter KitI bought for child proofing our living room. Having only one magnet key was a worry in case we lost it or locked it inside a cabinet so a second spare was essential. Yes, it's expensive for what it is but the money is worth the piece of mind."
5,Worth the money and hassle,"These are not the easiest things to install. I did it by myself, without too much trouble but it took some time to get it right. If you are renting, these are maybe not something to bother with unless you'll be there for a while. If you own, these are amazing and so much better than the stupid clips. First of all, no finger pinching with these things. Second, any clever toddler figures out those clip locks after a while and then what good are they? We don't lock all of our cabinets, but the ones that hold chemicals and knives are obviously locked. You can disable these too, so if you no longer need it locked you don't have to uninstall them.Just try not to lose the key inside one of the locked drawers, like I've done. As a sidenote, disc magnets will work, but you have to stack like 5 of them together to be strong enough. But we have them as a backup and they're much cheaper than a replacement key."
3,Not what is pictured but it works...,"We ordered this magnetic key from Amazon because we have not been able to find the Tot-Lok key alone locally. What we received is actually the Safety 1st magnetic key, not the Tot-Lok key. They aren not the same thing. The magnet still works and opens our locks but I am disappointed in the false advertising. We actually prefer the Tot-Lok style."
3,Not all CF cards are created alike,"If you think all CompactFlash cards are created alike, think again!! The SanDisk card is perfectly functional, but read/write times are very slow compared to other similarly-priced cards that are on the market. Check out products by Ridata and Transcend. These cards go for about the same price (or less) than the SanDisk products but are much faster. The only problem is that they are somewhat hard to find."
2,Card failed after 6 months,"My SanDisk worked with no problems for the first 6 or so months I had it. However, a couple weeks ago, after filling it to about 70% capacity with photos and taking it home, it crapped out. The disk reader wouldn't recognize the card, nor would the camera. They would each recognize other cards I had, but not this particular one. It was in the camera the whole time and hadn't been abused.I haven't tried support or warranty services yet, but the bottom line is that if there's something on the card you can't replace when it fails, you're out of luck."
3,Could be better...,"Disk is a little slower than others I am using. Seems to put photos in a different order than when I took them. Maybe it's camera, not sure. Other cards don't malfunction like this one does though. I get errors on this card where others I don't."
4,"Nice, But.............","I bought this 128mg card at Costco and I like it for the most part but when played in my mp3 player, I have some problems with the music flickering on and off once in a while which does not occur with my 64 and 32 meg card. But it really doesn't bother me since I only paid 59.99 at Costco. Its a great deal considering this little piece of memory has like 2000 times more RAM than Apple II's from the 80's!"
1,"This card is an atavistic relic, 128mb, really?","give me a break, these reviews should have been subject to change a decade ago. Who is at the controls at amazon? this is really cheap for 1990's"
5,SanDisk fast in Olympus C-5050,"I have been very happy with the SanDisk card performance in my Olympus C-5050. This is a 5 megapixel camera takes photo files that 2.5 to 3.0 MB size and I can snap off pictures as fast as the camera can autofocus. I also can review photos, even 9 photo thumbnail screens rapidly.This is my fourth digital camera and I have been happy with SanDisk's performance during the past several years I have used them."
2,A slow one...,This card a twice as slow compared to the new cards. Its controller is based on the old technology and I heard SunDisk is going to discontinue them in favor for a new faster Ultra series.I have also Viking 128MB card and it's much faster then SanDiskat the same price. Try Ridata if you want speed.
4,SANDISK 128MB Compact Flash,"Only reason I didn't give it 5stars is that they don't have a transfer speed rating on the package. Different brands of C/F Cards can transfer at different speeds and SanDisk conveniently leaves out this measurement. They also sell a premium version of the same size modules. What makes the premium memory better if they have no measurements to back it up? So, although this works fine in my DigiCam, I think they can do a better job educating the consumer on their product(s)."
1,Card went corrupt on our honeymoon,"Well, this card was working great until my honeymoon recently. Unfortunately the problem only surfaced when we tried to get the pictures off the card. I was able to download the first 12 or so and then most of the rest of the pictures were corrupt. I haven't had any problems with the camera so it must be the media; very disappointing performance."
2,Cant make it through,"And I love Ian McShane. And I love British history, and I love political drama. I don't get it. I just fade out after the first 1 1/2 episodes."
5,This TV Series Regarding Benjamin Disraeli Serves a Purpose,"Should the director and script writer attempted a less ambitious project? Whatever, there's enough here if one finds Bejamin Disraeli of interest. We follow his career from the age of about 32 to his death some 50 years later. Disraeli was a favorite of Queen Victoria. He apparently treated her as a mature and intelligent adult. In many respects, Disraeli was ahead of his time. He also had every intention of dragging British conservatives into the latter half of the 19th Century.Much is made of Disreali's Jewish ethnicity. He apparently perceived himself as an Anglican, almost Anglo-Saxon member of the British establishment. Was he a self hating Jew---or merely someone who considered an individual's DNA as a minor aspect of their life? This TV series suggest the latter explanation as the most accurate. You might also want to view the 1929 movie ""Disraeli"" starring George Arliss."
2,Disappointed,"I think Ian McShane is a find and serious actor. The costumes and scenery were excellent but the story was not put togeather correctly. The scenes jumped from one scene to the next without explaining how it got there. Just because someone in the story might mention something, that does not mean it takes place in the next scene. There were things that were taking place behind the scenes but we did not know what they were and how it affected the picture."
1,Cheap homemade production!!,I purchased this DVD thinking it would hold my attention with interesting graphics and evidence. Instead it consists of a one-on-one monotonous interview in a dimly lit room that drones on forever. A twelve year old could do a better production. Amazon's policy only allows 50% return on an opened DVD. Very dissatisfied to say the least.
2,Sticks,Worked great when I first got it. After about two weeks the no stick surface started to wear and the food began to stuck to the surface. Not recommended.
1,Not worth it!!!,I bought this and was not happy with the small wells. I also thought they looked bigger. I followed the directions for oiling it and the first thing I made stuck. The coating was chipping off when I went to wipe down after that FIRST USE. I found it real hard to clean. I then tried a muffin mix and they took forever to cook through and when they did the top and bottom of the muffin were hard and burnt. The recipes were good though. I sent it back the day after it arrived. I normally perservere but the chipped coating was not a good thing.
1,TEFLON COATING CHIPPED OFF IMMEDIATELY!!!,"The GT Express is a great idea, but is VERY POORLY MADE IN CHINA. Immediately after I started using it, the teflon coating began coming off. I've had it a month now and it is chipping off badly in both wells and in the middle.I would encourage anyone NOT to buy this product but wait until a quality manufacturer makes a product like this one with a teflon coating that doesn't immediately come off.I should have checked Amazon for the reviews before buying this worthless piece of trash."
1,Don't Buy The GT Express 101,"I, ordered the GT Express 101 and I was glad to see that it arrived as promised, but I noticed that the box had beentaped up looked like someone returned it before and then they shipped it to me. Anyway when I was already to used it the next day as soon as I plugged it in the wall, boom it triggered the circuit breaker and there was smoke all over the place. I am returning this thing back to them for a full refund."
5,A collection of rarities that stands perfectly on its own .,This collection of rarities has been long awaited by CJ fans. It's hard to believe that these are the songs that were cut. This disc is proof that every new CJ release should be a double-disc set!
2,Laaaaaaaaaaaame!,This game has blocky and awkward cinematics and the gameplay isn't much better. I played this game for about 4 hours or so and then gave up on it. Do yourself a favor and skip this one unless you're a die hard survival horror fan. -Osiris Z
4,The Complete Trilogy,"Alright...You have ""Enemy Zero"", ""D"", and ""D2""all three are great games, but not for everyone..""Enemy Zero"" (which is a little hard to get hold of) Is a little weird compared to the rest but a great game.""D"" is one of the best.. But slow slow slooooooowwwww moving and puzzle solving game. Very frustrating and you have to sit there and play it all in one shot.No saving... you have two hours to beat it. But otherwise graphics are great the creepiness vibe is awesome and it's just damn cool.""D2"" is a little different.. Really it doesn't have anything t do with ""D"" other than the main character. But still fun and a unque twist on the ""D"" thing...It comes down to this..You know how three's though ""Arthouse"" movies? and thse ""Underground"" bands? the types of media that do not get worldwide recognition and is only known by a few? well, these three games are it for the video game world.. Definetly not for everyone... but for some... check them out..."
3,"""HARDCORE GAMERS ONLY""","""Is this a movie or a video game"". About 75% of the timeline is cinema.The characters don't even talk in-sync,it's like watching a japaness dubbed movie.But yet, i don't want to discourage this type of gameplay,i like to see more of it in the furture, It's cinematic charm is a plus,it's weapons are awesome,it's simple gameplay is entertaning.it took me four days to finish it."
2,If I want a movie I will buy a DVD,This is not a game it is a completely computer rendered movie with good Dialogue decent story and wonderful music. The problem is I play video games to play and this title lacks gameplay in a woeful manner. You switch modes so there is some upclose gun battles alot of em in fact thats all the gameplay really consists of besides wandering around. The hunting mode is fun for about ten minutes until you master it. I would buy this game for under twenty bucks and be happy with the entertainment value I got from the FMV's and the soundtrack both of which are incredible. If you are looking for a scary little movie that you push along you might just like it but rent first.
5,As fantastic as I remembered,"I was recently going through old vinyl records and came across this soundtrack. I remember playing this a lot after having seen the movie. I loved it, so I got the CD to listen to now. I absolutely love it!"
5,A must-have,"This album was my starting point on listening to Mozart. After watching the film in 1984, I knew I had to own it. Needless to say, it is full of the most beautiful melodies ever written. A must-have for every music lover."
5,I found it haunting and mesmerizing....my first opera music!,"I never liked opera until I watched Amadeus. It has changed my whole attitude. Mozart, indeed, was a great artist."
1,"BEWARE, SACD is NOT 5.1 Channel","My low review is only for the SACD (not the music itself). It is not 5.1 channel, it is only stereo. Maybe I missed it somewhere but they should state clearly that this is stereo, and stereo ONLY. Saying it's a hybrid SACD doesn't cut it. There are other hybrid SACDs that are 5.1 channel as well as stereo. Other than that, the music is great. I guess I should have researched it more."
2,...PARTS MISSING FROM THE MOVIE,"...some musics are in the movie but not on the record !!!Where are the ""german dances""""?? //Where is ""Papageno"" aria?? is in the movie, but not on the record..."
1,used Amadeus DVD,This DVD was used. It is incomplete. Significant parts of the DVD are missing. It only runs for 45 minutes while the advertising says it should last 160 minutes !!Very discouraging.
5,It is a companion DVD.,"Dont be mislead, this DVD is not a stand alone version for the Scoliosis program offered in Your Plan For Natural Scoliosis Prevention and Treatment. I highly recommending reading the book and using this DVD to understand the exercises more. I made this mistake and had to wait for the book to get delivered to understand how to use this DVD. Overall both are excellent resources for scoliosis."
3,Not sure if this was an improvement.,I plugged this thing into my RV's PTC start circuit easily.Everything seems the same except the AC is quieter on start.Haven't had a chance to check to see if the cheap generatorwe have will start the compressor.Our Honda EU2000i fired the air conditioner right up beforeinstalling this. Our 5th wheel is 13 years old with a DometicDuo-Therm 13500.I will check to see if the other off brand genset works andupdate this review.
4,Great deal for the price.,"I paid $29.99 for this set on a Lightning Deal, and it is a very good set. I would rate this set in the middle of various J.A. Henckels knife sets, and worth around three times what I had paid for it.They have stamped blades, not forged, but do the job, as long as you keep them sharpened. The set also looks good on our black granite kitchen counter top. I recommend hand washing after each use.This set was made in China, not Germany, but the quality, for the price, is there. If you have the chance to buy this set for $70.00, or less, you will get your monies worth. I would also advise buying a good knife sharpener, because these knives do get dull after a few weeks of use."
3,Good but make sure you don't prefer wood handles,I sorry I guess a prefer a wood handle because these handles seem to be more slippery when cutting meat or anything greasy.Aside from that they ARE sharp and a very good set. A bargain for the money. The handles just don't do It for me. May be Perfect for you!Aside from that this Is quite a nice set. If your not a professional chef these will do nicely. On 4/2/09 I am editing this. I have gotten used to the handles and once you do they are pretty sweet. They are designed nice. I still prefer wood handles but I'd give these 4 stars now! From my 3 but I can't change that! These may last me the rest of my life!I got them deal of the day!!
4,"Great knives, esp. for the price","These are great knives and routinely on sale here on Amazon. If you're stepping into the world of better then target knives, these are a great start before plunging down hundreds of dollars for one knife."
4,Great Knife Set,I've only had the knife set for a month but so far it works great. Very sharp. It comes with directions on how to keep your knives sharp and in good condition. I think that if you follow these suggestions then the knives should be fine.
2,Sloppy Fit,"The knives don't fit the slots made for them very well and theknife sharpener doesn't fit well either, It's almost like the block is not the right one for the knives. I'm very dissapointed in the overall product quality. I was under the impression J. A. Henckel made hi quality products."
4,Nice Knife set,"This is a nice set of knives. I purchased them for show more than anything. My entire kitchen is stainless steel and I purchased this set to sit on the counter and look good with everthing else. What I found when I started to use them was that they are nice quality and hold an edge. Looks and quality, great combination."
3,Mediocre,"These knives are OK. For their price, they're actually decent. But these are, after all cheap, stamped knives. Expect to toss them after a year, and expect to sharpen them often, but not in a sharpener for nice knives.The block is surprisingly good-looking. The set as a whole goes very well in my super modern kitchen. I plan to keep using the block with nicer knives."
2,German Knives made in China?,I was completely surprised to find that the German knives I purchased were actually made in China. I think it is an important piece of information that was missing from the Amazon description.
2,crazy,This book was crazy. Did not make much since to me at all. Thiis book could have work but everyone made dumb decisions. It was just a sad novel.
1,Poor quality (or poor quality assurance),"Due to a misplaced screw too close to the zipper track, the clarinet bag could not be unzipped and therefore was returned. This particular item should never have left the factory."
1,not what i expected,"MY 5 YEAR OLD GRANDSON LOVED THE STORE OF THE 3 BEARS, SO I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE A GOOD DVD FOR HIM TO WATCH,NOT SO. THE ANIMATION IS AWFUL, CHARACTERS WERE UNREALISTIC,OVER ALL JUST A POORLY MADE MOVIE. THE KID NEVER WATCHED IT! WASTE OF MONEY."
1,"Great concept, poor quality","I initially thought this was a great product. The software looked like it had been developed for Windows 3.1, but looks aside, things were ok.After about 1 week of use, the presets went away... then the volume control and recording functionality. I uninstalled the software and drivers and re-installed from scratch only to get the same results. I downloaded the latest software from d-link and installed... only to get the same results.Contacting tech support didn't help either. Their suggestion: reinstall the software and drivers. Gee, thanks. If someone else were to write functional software for this product, it might be useful."
2,It worked - then it broke,"I had this thing for 2 weeks - and it actually did what it was advertised to do - receive and play FM radio through your pc. However, the way the Antenna connects to it's base absolutely stinks!!! They use an RCA plug connected to the extendable antenna via a very, very thin piece of steel. I move the antenna around a few times and that steel snapped, and there's no way to fix it.If you buy this - it will work, but don't move it too much."
3,Not what I hoped it would be,"Several months ago I bought a 12 string (Older Guild JF30-12) and thought it would be fun to listen to some, what would appear to be, vintage 12 string songs. While nice, on the whole, I am disappointed with this disc. Would have saved money by either buying used or downloading the best 3 or 4 tracks from Itunes (not sure if they can be found). Several of the tracks are poorly recorded and sound like they were Muzak from the 60's. Listen carefully to the samples before ordering.Seems to me there was a ""12 String Guitar of Glen Campbell"" disc out there long ago. That'll be my next search.Good luck!Terry"
3,A 12-string guitar album for completists,"Anthology of 12-String Guitar is a good way to understand why there is acoustic music before and after Fahey, Basho, Lang, Kottke and Sandy Bull.For 12-string completists, this album is a pleasant stroll through time. For anyone else, you'd have to really be into early folk-pop instrumental music."
2,Great Text; Iffy Printing...,"I agree with the benefits and usefulness of this book that most other reviewers have written. My only discomfort with the book is with its printing... The Greek section is generally fine, yet the Hebrew printing is often missing some of the vowels and consonants. Some pages have a stronger, darker print quality; other pages have a more faded and at times non-existent print quality. I find myself having to check whether there are certain vowels or conconants even present in this mentioned book, checking with my copy of the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia... I wish I only needed to consult me Interlinear..."
3,Flawed but essential,"I thought I was getting just the Hebrew Bible. Since it was meant for a Bat Mitsvah gift, I had to return it. I have, however, an Interlinear of my own, published by Zondervan press, which appears identical to the one illustrated here.If this is, as one reviewer claims, the only Interlinear keyed to Strong's, it is essential.These are the minimum requirements if it is your intention to read the Hebrew and understand what you are reading word for word: a good Hebrew bible (for readable print), a pocket Hebrew/English, English/Hebrew dictionary (Ben YeHuda's), The Interpretor's Bible, a Strong's, and an Interlinear keyed to Strong's.Its flaws are a poor binding (mine has fallen into folios), and poor print.How many stars does one give a flawed book for which there is no substitute?"
2,Poor typeface,"The content of this book is from the Bible and the litteral translation excellent, however the printing is of very bad quality. I found many better type face on 25 cents books... Sorry, I had to return the book because I could not identify the Hebrew letters on the edges of the text. Perhaps I got a bad copy ?"
4,Great Study Bible,"Excellent Study Bible, it also looks like the Strongs numbers have been fixed, because mine are correct, so far, I still have several thousand to check :)"
4,Excellent Content -- Difficult Format,"As a student of Koine Greek, I find this book to be a valuable resource; I use it daily. However, the print is too small for me, even with the use of a good magnifying glass. As soon as the four-volume edition is available, I will purchase it and sell this book on eBay. Other readers might find the print size tolerable, but my eyes are a bit weak."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this interlinear from Amazon and had it shipped to the UK. From reading the reviews I looked forward to receiving it and using it in study. However when it came the quality of the book was very disappointing. The print quality is very poor which makes the Hebrew difficult to read, and the quality of the book construction itself is also very poor. It seems to be manufactured in the cheapest way possible - what should be a delight to own is rendered frustrating.I decided that I could not live with it and that it would not really be useable - so I have returned it at the cost of 13!! Had it been more readable I might have kept it despite the poor quality - I shall get separate Hebrew and Greek interlinears I think!"
4,Hebrew-Greek Bible Study aid,"A necessary portable complete Interlinear Bible, and a useful study aid. Small print, but that is understandable given the wealth of information in the book. This book would be more useful if it had a Strong's Hebrew-Greek dictionary in the back keyed to Strong's Concordant Numbers. As it is, to use the Strong's numbers in the Interlinear requires you to haul along a Strong's Concordance, (an equally large sized book."
3,Print size,"Due to the print size, even with a magnifying glass you cannot read the Niqqud (vowels) in the Hebrew or the breathings and accents in the greek.It's a brilliant translation, though not perfect.However, I rarely use this book because of the printing issues.It needs bigger print.I'd rather have a larger book than print I cannot read."
4,Great study aid.,"I had never heard of an interlinear bible before. I looked this up and found it on Amazon. I bought it several years ago. It has been a great study aid. I have referred to it often while studying the Bible. I gave 4 stars because I agree with the other reviewers that the print quality could be better. I got it pretty cheap anyway, so it's not a big deal."
1,Interlinear Old Testament seems error prone,"Excited about such a presentation as this interlinear text, I quickly looked up a couple of verses. Since Genesis is available for review, I decided to look there. Genesis 4:1 looked okay. okay now Genesis 3:15 - oops. H7779 (bruise) was incorrectly labeled as H2233 (seed/semen).I'm interested in using a book like this to explore and understand the meaning of the underlying text, but if errors are introduced by the author of this book on the scale that it seems to be based on the sample data, this makes the book, which initially comes across as an authority on the bible, instead be an obstacle to correct learning.How can anyone recommend a reference tool prone to error?"
2,Very disapointing,"If you are considering this reference book it is most likely because you are serious about taking your study to the next level and desire to know as close as possible the authors original meaning. I would recommend you pass on this book. The very first passage I looked up, Mark 3:29 has an incorrect numbering for the Strongs concordance. 166 is numbered as 2496. Going back to the reviews I see others have pointed out other numbering errors. Also important to me was A literal translation. With all its difficulties I wanted as true a translation as possible. This is the worst of any attempt at a literal translation I have read. It seems the author was going more for his own paraphrase edition. Save your money, I wish I would have."
3,needs more wildlife and puppet scenes,"Although entertaining for my child, this video lacks the excitement generated by the Baby Road Trip JUNGLE video.This video would be a lot better if it had more videos of wild animals present in a circus as well as more animal puppet scenes, something most toddlers really enjoy."
4,Nice Gardening Shears Have Worked for Over Ten Years Despite Hard Use,"First of all, I must say that Oxo has a great return policy. Over 10 years ago, I had bought two pairs of these. Both of the springs broke. I wrote them a letter, and they sent two new pairs.They must have improved the design, as I have used the two replacement pairs down to this day. These shears have mostly been used for garden trimming and cutting non-woody flowers for arrangements. As a one-time full-time horticulturist, they have taken hard use and held up. I like the spring action. It is less fatiguing for the hands. However, the red locking clip does fall into the path of the handle sometimes and that can be irritating.As with other shears, I clean them regularly and sharpen them when dull.For kitchen cutting, I use a lightweight pair of Fiskars that can be taken apart for cleaning."
4,I may spray said elephant with paint...,"and it would then be visible. In doing so, I have not ""touched"" it and I would then be able to discern if I may (potentially) be the recipient of an excrement shower.Regardless, my point isn't so much that I'm *right* and Bad Religion are *not*. Rather, that I believe that they are attempting to present themselves as possessed of an intellect greater than Joe Sixpack vis a vis their lyrics, but I find the arguments somewhat less than compelling. Particularly (whether or not it's borrowed from Nietzsche) the assumption that ""If it's real for me, do I have to prove it to you?"" They must...if they want me to see the error of my ways (as they seem to assume I am, in fact, in error)."
5,FASTHARDROCKIN',"This is certainly not a dissapointing record whatsoever, its fast, catchy, heavy, punky, and awesome. Most of the tracks are pretty fast and catchy, and even the ones that arent are great [Broken, Sorrow, Epiphany, etc.) In general, it is a very HIGH ENERGY CD thats bound to keep you interested till the end. Dont miss out on it!!!"
5,This is an awesomely awesome CD,"For anyone who truly loves Bad Religion, this is a tasty treat. IT totally kicks ass...nice sounds, killer lyrics, its just an all around good cd. BUY IT NOW DAMMIT"
5,Totally Blown Away...wow.,"My God.It is to my untimely shame to admit that this is my first Bad Religion CD. I cannot believe it after hearing The Process of Belief.I don't even know where to begin. This is definately the best album of 2002, despite anything ANYONE says. The songs are very powerful and well-organized, beginning with Supersonic, a short, fast-paced, balls-to-the-wall song that kicks the album off in style. Later on there are two songs that should be preserved throughout the ages: Sorrow and Epiphany. Sorrow was the first song I heard from this CD, and in fact was what prompted me to buy it. Epiphany, is the most moving thing I have heard in a long, long time. I could leave it on 'repeat' for hours.If you don't have this CD yet, you'd better have a damn good reason, because you're missing out on more than you'll ever know."
5,LITERALLY blew me away,"well obviously not literally. this was my favorite bad religion for some time, and also my first. it influenced me to get some of their older stuff, which i now prefer, but it has not lost it's impact. pop-style punk it may be compared to early BR albums, but it is set far apart from other stuff given that same label by it's superb intelligent songwriting and melody. i listen to it all the time. 'broken' is the obvious pop track, while more familiar punk standouts include 'supersonic' and 'evangeline'. 'the defense' shows the innovation that still exists within a band who have been around for 20 years and still produce this level of greatness. i love you."
5,They are back!,Bad religion back with Mr brett.Old style Bad Religion with the unbeatable combo of Greg and Brett make this album a very very must have for music fans of all genres!
5,Bad Religion: Broken no more,"If you feel that the previous two Bad Religion albums, ""No Substance"" and ""The New America,"" were lacking the flair that made Bad Religion a sensation on albums such as ""Against the Grain"" and ""Suffer,"" do not dispair: Bad Religion is back, and back to their punk rock roots. Listening through the first three tracks will convince you of this with little effort. After that, the tracks grow longer, but the intensity does not fade. The incredible guitar solos are still there, the deep lyrics, and the mad drumming will resonate in your ears and fill your soul for months to come. Look out Blink 182, Sum 41, and all the other ill-mannered, red-headed, punk rock-posing stepchilds out there: The masters are back, and they've never sounded better."
5,I swear when I...,"when I heard The Defense on the radio I thought Bush had a new album out. But I found out that it was Bad Religion and I was blown away. Anyway, just wanted to share that story!"
3,are ya a punk?,"Are ya? If you want true punk rock, and not snively whiny brats dressed up like punk rockers, get this!"
2,Bad Relgion getting stale,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a diehard BR fan, but all their newest stuff has been done before, and done much better. These new songs start to sound identical, with the same concept and words in each song. You want GOOD Bad Religion, go get Against the grain, or 80-85, or a much more quality album than this. That said it is still BR, and it's their first album with Mr. Brett back, so it's not terrible. Hell, screw this, just go get the new Punk-O-Rama 7."
5,The old and good BR is back!,"The old and good punk rock is back. This album is full of intellectual and political critics, it's like hearing the first BR albuns. The last one (The New America) was too pop... Too commercial. But this one is not. It's worth each dime. The only sad thing is that Bobby is uncapable of doing his good work on the drums, but the new drummer kept the pace and accelerated into a very good rhythm. Buy it [...]"
5,Great All the Way Through,This is one of a few of my punk rock cds that I listen to all the way through. I have two cds that I have to skip to every other song. The songs are short and it is hard to tell when one ends and another begins but the songs make up for that. This is a cd to spend money for it!
4,A valuable resource to those building on line communities,"""Building on line Communities with phpBB2"" is one of the few technical books on its kind that keeps up with what it promises. That is to offer ""practical guidance for someone to get the most from phpBB"".The book provides practical examples and hands on advice on issues like installation and configuration, administration, development of themes and styles, creation of MOD's and more.Beginners with basic technical knowledge will benefit the most since they will be able to start deploying their on line community after the first couple of chapters.As a teacher and consultant to several businesses and organizations i have found this book to be a valuable resource to anyone aiming to build and grow an on line community"
2,Not very useful,This book covers phpBB 2 - the current version is 3. It seems to be quite a bit different. I didn't find it useful.
2,"Over Promiss, under deliver","This book is typical of computer books today, more fluff, half the book is about how to use PhpBB, a fourth is dedicated to a very few of the nuts and bolts of making Modifications to a template to make it met your needs. It as well as a lot of COMPUTER books, is closer to a sham and is a shame for the price. Save your money, I wish there was a book that would definitively tell you what you need to REALLY modify a base template, let alone how to build one from scratch. The back cover like lots of computer books offers to show you the way to meaningful insight on the subject, but alas is to get you to part with your dollars for naught. IF any one knows of a GOOD overview of this subject and a better book please give us poorer( for buying the book) souls a hint."
5,Staple to makeup routine,I've been using this eyeliner for 2 years now! It applies well and doesn't give you panda eyes - I have no desire to change to another eyeliner either.
1,Weak magnet,Very weak magnet. Won't hold alot of paper. Would not recommend for anything more than 2-3 pieces of heavy stock.
2,it says mother not mom,i know a little about Egyption hieroglyphics and i know that the pendent says mother not mom. i know that some people r like so what it means the same thing but i feel that when u spend that much money on something u should at less have the right translation.so for anyone who is still reading this i will tell u about the symbols i know: the fist is a bird(i believe an owl) which stands for M / the second is a rope which is an O / the third symbol(which looks like a U on its side) stands for TH / then the feather looking symbols stands for E (it is also the symbol for I and Y) / the symbol that looks kinda like a mouth is R / and the last symbol is a woman siting which stands for woman. so yea if you wanted to know what the symbols stood for now u know and if u buy it for someone u can tell them what the symbols stand for and look super smart ;)
3,SMALL!!! Don't buy for a child over 6 mos.,"I bought this for my child's Christmas stocking. She was 10 mos at the time. It was waaaaaay too small. This would fit a very small baby, but I wouldn't purchase for a child over 3-6 mos at the most. It is cute and looks good."
3,Mark Kistler's Drawing In 3-D Wacky Workbook,"Mark Kistler has created fun, exciting, and challenging drawing lessons in his Draw Squad and Imagination Station books. Using a few simple rules, he teaches how to draw 3-D scenes, objects and characters. This book, ""Drawing In 3-D Wacky Workbook"", is a companion to Mark Kistler's ""Drawing In 3-D."" When used with ""Drawing In 3-D"", the Wacky Workbook becomes a place to practice the skills and characters taught. I like the fresh, fun drawings he teaches. When used thoughtfully,the book becomes an art journal, showing how you are improving as you go through the book. The skills learned can be applied in many and various ways. The only objection I would have is that it does not stand well on its own, but depends on the ""Drawing In 3-D"" book for it to make sense. Otherwise, it is a fine tool to help children practice their drawing and record their progress."
1,Amazon listed wrong,This was listed as Drawing in 3D. I already had the workbook. I did write the seller and they forwarded my complaint on to Amazon which did not even respond. This may be the last time I buy from Amazon when they do not even answer a complaint.
1,Broken on arrival.....,I ordered this product thinking it was one I have seen before. It is all plastic and arrived broken. I made some modifications to it and made it into a 4 bottle dispenser. This didn't help any....It is too weak and flimsy to hold even four bottles securely enough to trust any good liquir in. It is now in the trash.
1,Olympus leather case a tad small,"The leather case is a snug fit for the Olympus IR500 camera. In fact, it is not possible to insert the camera fully; closing the flap so the velcro grabs is iffy. The IR500 is about as small as digital cameras get so it would seem this case is not practical for the majority of small cameras."
4,Olypmus Leather Case,"It is sturdy and easy access in and out.Having the hand-cord attached to the camera is more tedious than it should be to fit the cord through the cover's hole.I would think that the material liner of the case should be such that it would not scratch the display.Overall, I like the case. I had previously used a neoprene beer can insulator for the case."
1,Too Snug for an Olympus C60,The camera is small but the case is even smaller! The snug fit cause the lense to open while forcing the fit into the case. I do not recommend this case and I ended up buying another one that fit.
4,Adorable Costume/Dubious Construction,"Not too much to say about this, on my daughter it looks pretty much just like the picture. I've had to downgrade my review somewhat as other people in the family have disclosed the number of repairs they have made that I was previously unaware of. I still generally like this product, but the quality is definitely not there. My daughter is a tall, but fairly thin, 4T and we found the fit to be almost perfect. It might be problematic for a child close to the low end of the size range.Let's be honest, it's a costume, I can only give it educational credit for giving my daughter and I a reason to talk extensively about zebras. But, I don't expect a costume to come with a calculus text."
5,Excellent Text,"This is one of the better organic textbooks on the market today. It gives a comprehensive approach to the basics, and also provides a more in-depth view of more advanced topics. This is the text my advanced organic chemistry text uses, and I have been very happy with it. Plus the price was great."
5,Great book for both beginners and advanced chemistry students,"This book provides with a complete review of all the major organic chemical groups and gives a detailed and thorough presentation of their chemical structure as well as their reactivity. It also deals with a series of organic reactions that are considered as the basic ones in organic chemistry with a good overview of their mechanistic pathways.Finally, the writers offer plenty of examples in which these reactions are used in the synthesis of pharmaceutical or other compounds.Without a doubt, one of the most useful, comprehensive and complete book in organic chemistry for both beginers and advanced organic chemistry students."
2,Interesting but basis,Its an interesting read but its alot of liberal bunk too. Its offers alot of problems with the current political system but no solutions.
3,Old school take on corruption,"Drew's difficulty rests in the fact that she is a mainstream media journalist. She simply assumes that policy, poor policy, is passed because of the evils of money. That is not entirely the case you see, as someone's special interests are another's free speech efforts. This is the problem because it forces her analysis to travel through the prism of ""all money is bad."" As a result, she misses the impact of other things that prevent government's failure from being diagnosed. One of the reason that politics is also corrupt is the incestious relationships between those in the political class. This is also another form of corruption because such an environment fosters closed-door deals and agreement based on consensus, which both insulate government from the public's will. So just be aware of what you're getting with this book, an inside baseball view of corruption."
2,"Poor Performance, By Sega","Teh graphics are great, and the......, well that all that is great about this game. The controls you learn to deal with the lack of commentary as well, but the increible good al or computer player will drive you crazy. I find myself only playing the two player mode. It's arcade hertiage really hurts the game, but if you like soccer as much as I do then you just have to live with it till something better rolls around."
2,RIP OFF!!!,"Yeah, this game looked exciting when I first bought it. You don't use the analong stick, but the control pad. I first ignored the ignoring of my forwards stopping when I kicked the ball into my opponents half. Plus you can't dribble in this game, you're forwards are really slow, the upside is you're defenders are pretty fast though !!The defenders will steal the ball from you if you hold it to long!! Then you can never tell where the keeper is if you have a fastbreak!! Then once the computer gets a cross in the middle they mostly score!! So don't let the computer run down the side or they'll score on a very good-looking header or bicycle kick. So DON""T GET THIS GAME unless you're some kind of collector trying to collect all the soccer games for systems!!"
1,Please improve the games,"World Wide Soccer 97 & 98 for Sega Saturn was classic games for a person who really knows about the game of football. So when the Dreamcast came out, I rushed to buy the system thinking Sega Sports was going to give me something even better than the soccer games for Saturn. I was wrong, had to return the whole system and the game. Virtura Striker 2 is like going back in time, way back. Graphics and realistic play are non-existant for the Virtura Striker 2. I have a few little things they could of done to improve a top of the line game like World Wide Soccer, they could of added Italian, Americian, German clubs, added snow, and also more countries.The makers of the new soccer game should of also made it possible to trade players and also made it possible to role play thus enabling the player of the system to control the player of their choice, and last of all improve on the graphics which should be done on all new video games."
2,Virtua Striker not for the complex player,"If you love the FIFA series, this is definently not the game for you. With only three action buttons, the game leaves little room for any hope of trick moves, amazing headers, bicycle kicks, or jukes. I just have one question, is it feasible for EA Sports to introduce FIFA to the Dreamcast?"
1,Bad game,Doesn't play like real soccer. The graphics are good but the play is bad. Don't buy this ... game or you'll end up trying to sell it back!
2,"Oh, the sadness... whimper, whimper","*Sigh*-- with tremendous dissapointment, I have to say that the only real soccer title on the Dreamcast console is a terrible dissappointment. It just doesn't stand up as a game, with horrific gameplay absolutely killing any advance made in graphics for this system. Any soccer fan who was loyal to ISS or FIFA before jumping to the Dreamcast platform should NOT, I repeat, NOT, bother with this game... the worst sports title since Virtua Athlete. Oh, the sadness... Dreamcast, when will you find the soccer game worthy of your platform?"
3,It's got Problems,"This game has ups and downs. i'll start with the ups, it has excellent graphics and the movements of the players and ball is very realistic. From afar this looks like it is better than Fifa 99. The crowds are great the feeling of scoring a goal is great. it is not easy though. the down side of it is that you cannot control anything. it has about a 2 second delay. and it feels more like the computer is controlling than you are. defense you can sit back and do nothing because that is how much control you have. i do not recommend this game to anyone no matter how good it looks."
2,gamer from VA,"I've played a million soccer games throughout my life, and DC is definitely the most advanced system I've ever played on. So, I'm really amazed at the lack of options in the game overall and especially the control of players. I can't believe you don't have the option of manually switching players - this really hurts a game that had a lot of potential. It seems like everytime you're headed towards the ball, the computer switches your player before you can get to it. You can't even use the goalkeeper unless its a penalty kick or free kick. Unbelievable! But, if your into graphics - this is the game for you."
2,The worst soccer game ever. Do not throw your money away!,"The VS Dreamcast version is far away from the one we can play in arcades. The players do not really do what you want at all. Controlling and passing is very bad, and, the teams have nothing to do with the reality. Do not get surprised if you are playing with Brazil (a top team) against Jamaica (one of the weakest) and this ""lazy"" team scores easily and quickly a hard trick. Before purchasing VS2 I was doubting whether to buy this game or Striker Pro 2000 from Infogrames. Now, I know that the ""Info"" guys will certainly not be able to make such as bad game, even if they do their best to do so. The only acceptable thing: Graphics, which are very good. But, thanks, I rather enjoy a videogame by playing it than just viewing it graphics. Now I'm purchasing Striker Pro 2000 and will make the comparisson. PLEASE DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY! There are thousands of videogames better than this one!"
3,Ok Game,virtua striker has great graphics but the control on the players isvery bad and it is very hard i bought it for my son and he doesn't play it anymore becuse it is frustrating for him because it so hard but there is a wide variety of teams like brazil france and usa
2,Rancid,"I bought this game thinking, can't go wrong with soccer. Guess what, you can. I too may have been spoiled on the FIFA series, but it's a shame FIFA isn't coming to the Dreamcast any time soon.What are the problems? Where should I begin... the worst problem for me was the lack of a player switch control. That is, you have to go with whoever the computer thinks you should be controlling at the moment. You can't choose which player you control.Secondly, and almost as big of a problem, is that the stick isn't used at all! The D-pad just doesn't give the precision that you need to play soccer.Also, the graphics are pretty amateurish, as is the sound.Nice pace of gameplay, though. I do like the speed. But that's about all I like about the game."
1,Two words: It Stinks!,Horrible game play. You pass the ball to someone on your team and he stops moving to the ball. It is so difficult to maintain possession of the ball yet the computer seems to be able to do it.I don't like the fact that you have to acquire power before a shot on goal. By the time you do this the computer has already taken the ball away. FIFA '98 on Nintendo 64 is a lot better.
3,awsome graphics,Theres just one good thing about this game and that is the graphics which you should already expect from dreamcast other than that it's just like a real arcade game. If your in to that go ahead get it but I wouldn't reccomend it.
4,thanks~~itz cool,itz just cool....and good shipping.......itz kinda fastgame is just cool.....SEGA ..cool company...make some more games on DreamCast ...plZ~~~~~~
5,XOXO,"From Kristen Bell's perky and cynical voiceover to the nasty but oh so sexy Chuck Bass this series has it all. Tortured, artistic and righteous Dan (or should we call him Dawson already!!) to Blair Wardorf stylish scheming ways no one is immune. Real-life NY locations only add to the glamours backdrop. The Parental units are hot( how old is Rufus?) and play the proper supporting role to rumor, scandal and innuendo that is the GG way. Very well cast, fast enough paced and just different enough to push a few buttons in the classic teen genre. Love it, need it, want series 2"
3,Good show but not like the books,I have enjoyed watching Gossip Girl season 1; however I feel that the series has lost something that was present in the books. The books are layered with corruption and sex and tragedy but the series tries to clean up the books. If you like teen dramas you will love this show. I do suggest you read the books because you will begin to see you rich the lives of these teenagers are in reality.
5,great sho!,the shows is great and the bonus features are a really fun way to get a look at behind the scenes of this show.
5,Gossip Girl Season 1,"I bought this a week ago from amazon.It cost me $20.00 ONLY! i was very surprised when i saw it and i could not say no.Im glad i bought it right away, because i just saw that the price went up again...As for the show, it is one of the best shows out there right now. I would recommend it to anyone specially to the people who loved ""THE OC""."
5,Addictive!,"I bought this DVD set as a gift, and ended up watching it with who I bought it for, it's so good! The actors are talented, the story interested, and the price at Amazon is great - can't go wrong here!"
5,Addicting,I bought this as a gift for my sister. Then I decided to sit and watch the first episode with her to enjoy her birthday present with her. Then I was hooked on the show without knowing it. Good show.
5,PERFECT,Everything came just as promised. I didn't end up saving any money vs. the price I could've gotten it for from a normal store.
4,"Shipping, Condition and Quality","Standard shipping came within 6 days which was nice. The condition came pretty good except when I turned to check the spine of the dvd case. It was a little banged up, but I hope there was no damage to the discs itself. The dvd only came in a bubble wrapped lined envelope, when I was expecting it to arrive in a small box (to really protect the dvd set). We'll see how the quality of the discs came out aswell, if there are any skips or discoloration. But overall very good!"
1,Gossip Girl: DO NOT BUY,"The DVD upon opening looked in great condition, the first disc works great, but after enjoying the episodes I attempted to watch the special features disc and it was unresponsive. I attempted to turn on and off the player, and then I proceeded to check the disc.The disc was sent with minor scratches on the item rendering it unusable. I attempted to contact Amazon, but they informed me since the item is open I would be only eligible for a 50% refund. HOW CAN YOU TELL AN ITEM IS SCRATCHED WITHOUT OPENING THE PRODUCT.BUYER BEWARE. Purchase from a store where there is a satisfaction guarentee, you'll pay a little extra, but you wont get ripped off."
3,Gossip Gird - 1st Season,I did not watch this DVD as when it arrived at my house I realized I had ordered the wrong one.
2,"O Let's teach Gossip, Materialism, Drug Use, and Alcoholism, but","it must be entertaining. You wonder why our country is getting worse when it is being run more and more by attractive, brain damaged, mentally ill children and is being openly promoted to worsen this problem through ""addictive entertainment"". ""Pot"" the ""new cigarette"" and ""caffeinated beer"" the ""new soft drink"" coming soon to a convenience store near you with no age requirement. The Brain is still developing and is permanently damaged before age 25. It's fun being a throw away kid as long as your ""baby parents"" is rich; you have all the world's poor to exploit. Enslave them through drug use, gossip, with a dress, blackmail. Narcissism is the stuff your dreams should be made of."
1,Terrible show,"The purpose of this show seems to be to convince young girls that woman should rip each other apart, backstab, and have a complete lack of morals. And to show them that a young man that attempts to rape girls is awesome and hot and such a great bad boy!"
2,Very disappointed,"I purchased expedited shipping and received it one day before Amazon predicted (but well after the seller advertised). The case was cracked down the middle and panels that hold the DVDs fell out when I opened the package. Much to my disdain, Disk One was missing! That's not even to mention that Disk Five was completely out of it's slot and sliding around.However, the seller did refund me the entire purchase and the DVDs do work, hence the two star rating instead of a one-star."
5,A great series,"This is a great series and will get you hooked. Don't go into this thinking that it will be a profound, deeply moving show. It's a show for preteens but can be enjoyed by any age (I'm in my twenties, and a medical student). It's like a soap but without all the cheesiness. There is still some cliched moments but really the camera work is very artful and my BF and I (he watches it too, and likes it but would never admit it to anyone else) have even commented aloud on the quality of the cinematography at times. Great show, get hooked and with no commercials, it's easy to watch a full episode in 40 minutes!"
4,Informational and Inspiring!,"I enjoyed reading this book. Written for 7-9th grade reading and comprehension level, Sally Hobart Alexander's story of triumph over her blindness will appeal to all age levels, including the adult reader. This book is the sequel to her first autobiography, and follows Hobart's life after leaving a residential school for the blind, where she takes a job as a teacher, and she learns to live her life as a blind adult who was once fully sighted."
1,Review,"I would love to be able to Review this product, If in fact we ever do get it.We ordered the Cradele , on the 14th off last month , when we found the package dumped in our front yard after 2 days off looking, we found that Bargaincell had indeed sent completely the wrong item.At this time , one full month later , we have still not received our Cradle so unfortunatly I can not REVIEW something that we have never receivedLesson learnedBUYER BEWARE"
3,not what I was looking for,"Not what I expected. It is right for very small, not for comercial livestock breeders.I was looking for something more focused on comercial farming, with modern facilities, this is focus on the reomantic old fashined american animal farming."
2,wasted money,I purchased this book and quickly found that it is basically a catalog of plans that are available free online from USDA and others. The web links for the plans are printed right in the back. There is very little detail on how to do any thing. very generic info very disappointed..
5,"Practical Plans, Useful Commentary","This book has clear, measured plan drawings for a variety of housing elements useful for a small-scale farmer. So far, I have adapted two plans to fit my space and materials available, and have been happy with the results. The author includes good explanations of why you should build things the way she says, which really helps when you need to modify one of her plans.An excellent book, should really hit the spot for the new farmer, or somebody adding a new species to their operation."
4,good choice,I wanted to get some ideas for some different kinds of coops. The book did give the design basics for different kinds of housing from small to large. It was sufficient.
5,Getr' done,"Great projects, concise writing, great way to add to your design ideas for building ""homes"" for your ""crew""."
5,"How to Build Animal Housing: 60 Plans for Coops, Hutches, Barns, Shed, Pens, Nestboxes, Feeders, Stanchions, and Much More","I received the book in quick time and well packaged. It is a great book, and will be used well by both my daughter and me.Thank you."
3,The plans included didn't meet my needs,"I was hoping for a book of plans that included small, simple to build shelters for just a few goats and chickens. The plans included were large and the building instructions were not detailed enough for beginners to do themselves (without a seperate how-to-book). If I could have looked through it first, I would not have bought it."
3,Important details left out.,"This is a great book for ideas. It falls very short on important details.This book is about building animal shelters, but none of these planshave a listing of the parts needed. This is doubly important becausethese are complicated plans. I would like to build the rabbit house,but now I am having to approximate what I need. The author needs toremember that someone wanting to use this book might live 20 miles awayfrom the hardware store."
2,A little disappointing,"I was a bit disappointed to find the plans in this book are USDA plans from the 1970s and were not in my view very creative or innovating or interesting. The rabbit house was just a shed of small cages, aimed at someone raising rabbits for food, I suppose, and not in any way pleasant for the rabbits."
4,"Great book, just what I was looking for.",This book has a great array of shelters. I was looking for a couple types of shelters... chicken coop and horse run-ins and found ideas to match just what I needed for both!
2,There are better,"This book flips back and forth from beginner to the expert. A book of black and white drawing without list of materials to order. Many of the pictures are precise while other are left to your imagination of what the author intends. The best picture is the cover. Whole chapters are spent on the very basics of carpentry best left for a basic carpentry book. An example is the pages that are devoted to ""drying native wood"" and where in the tree your board plank came from. This may be useful for those without any carpentry abilites or knowledge. Meanwhile many of the ""plans"" for many of the pictures are left unexplained. I feel there are much better books for you to spend on trying to build Animal Housing. One would best look to animal specfic books, i.e chicken books, horse book etc."
5,Romantic,"This gentleman has a true talent. You can hear his passion, even in popular Christmas music. I have enjoyed this album the best because it highlights his playing with only limited backup musicians. All of his work is worth hearing over and over again."
5,Excellent Update of Swales's work on genre,"This book shows that John Swales does not rest on his laurels, but is constantly updating his analysis of genre. It is an excellent book and an important text for anyone dealing in text analysis."
2,Disappointingly Dated,"Before purchasing this book, I checked to see when the book was published, or at least updated...2004 the copyright page said.How disappointing, then, to discover (after I'd puchased the book) that many of the examples used for the book are outdated. For example, few of the many business card examples display web or internet addresses.How far back do these wonderous examples take us if they were gathered from pre-internet days? I was hoping for progressive examples of the best of today's work, not yesteryear's."
1,"Outdated, only a few good examples.","As another reviewer stated, this compilation is outdated. Rockport does not usually disappoint but they do with this title. Most of the examples are old and very few are well done. Hopefully better work is being done than this!"
5,great looking watch,"Just bought this watch off Amazon. So far, I love it. The big numbers give it a funky vibe -- even as it's a serious timepiece. Adjusting the band to the right size is a tricky process. I tried it myself (bought the $15 tool), but ended up going to a watch store to get the job done right. Overall, a solid, great looking wrist watch."
3,Steampunk Classic,"Morlock Night has the imagination and action I expect from K.W. Jeter after reading Infernal Devices. The ending would have been better received if I had cared more for the main character, but overall it was an entertaining read."
1,and I had such high hopes...,"The idea of the Morlocks using the time machine to menace Victorian London is a good one - I'd like to see someone else give it a shot.I first saw a reference to this book in a science fiction encyclopedia, under the ""Cyberpunk"" entry. But it's not really cyberpunk, or even science fiction. It's a rather poor fantasy novel, with more sorcery than science fiction. If the idea of the Morlock-fighting protagonists, including Merlin and King Arthur, running about London's oldest and deepest sewers, which are actually remnants of Atlantis, in a recovered Atlantean submarine sounds stupid to you, then you'll understand why it was a struggle to make myself finish reading this thing."
5,Great Gaia!,"As a sometime fan of Spidey, i was *riveted* to my chair, shushing my hubby as i delved into this story. I quit reading -Spiderman- shortly after Gwen Stacy's death; this brings it back w/a vengeance ... & now i'd pleased, glad, *ecstatic* that Straczynski took over the reins.Having read some of the fannish buzz around this story arc, i was cringing when i opened it. Then i was mesmerized, and then....I won't spoil this, i WON'T! But ... this was the story that *needed* telling, the tale that ties the man together. I'll never read an older, pre-Stacy-loss -Spiderman- again w/o remembering this dramatic dénoument to the agonizing tale of How/Why Gwen was taken from Peter [O what an ironic statement!] & his adjustment to that loss.If i could, i'd give it 10 stars..."
1,Truly Awful,"Michael Straczynski messes, re-invents and destroys the past history of Spiderman. Gwen Stacy always had a special sacred place in the hearts of Spiderman fans. This story totally rubbishes it and tramples over all the previous great writing on the book (from Stan Lee onwards) It should not have been allowed. The story is shot full of holes and is totally ridiculous"
2,bad story/sucker punch,Gwen Stacy: Mother of green goblin's children. An affair between them?I've decided to imagine I never read this book !
5,The best CDRW in the market,I use this CDRW (8424s-vk) after using more the 20 disks i did not have any errors or any other prob. installing this drive using my scsi 7895 adapter was easy. the software is easy to use and it takes 10 minutes to start back up your system.
5,Nobody Knows: The Best of Paul Brady,"""The Island"" was the main reason I made this purchase.....""The Lakes of Ponchartrain"" was probably the least. I was very pleasantly surprised at the entire CD. And although I have some trouble fully understanding all the lyrics, it's one of those ""put the top down on your car on a sunny day & float down the highway"" CD's. The sounds are upbeat, thought provoking,crisp & clear. Made me want to bounce as I drove!!! Though I'm an avid Irish Trad. person, Paul's sounds are universal. Not the usual Trad lamenting on war & tradgedy.I liked this CD from beginning to end! Nice, very nice!"
2,Ho Hum,"Of all the books in this series which I have read up to this point, I found this book the hardest to get through. It seemed disjointed and rather unbelievable. We never really did find out why Cottonmouth wanted Musselwhite so much that he did all that raiding and pillaging. I didn't feel an affinity for any of the characters except for little Kelp. Even the Dreamers, who are usually the most intersting characters, were poorly characterized. I will read the remaining three books in the series, but this is definitely the weakest so far."
2,Needs Creative Writing 101,A moderately interesting story marred by stilted dialog and overuse of descriptive detail.
5,Great Fun if You're a Golfer or Not,"I laughed my head off when I read this little book. I just couldn't put it down even though I had other things to do that ""seemed"" more important. Think of the possibilities: birthdays, Boss' Day, Father's Day. Makes a great gift for any golfer on your list, male or female."
1,"Wow, just wow",This book is awful. I can't believe Amazon allowed one reviewer to consistently rate it 5 stars over several months and blatantly promote it as such.
1,501 Excuses for a Bad Golf Shot,Did the same person write all te other reviews perhaps?This book is a huge waste of money. It is so terribly simplistic I cannot even say it is funny at any time. The author must really be a poor writer and certainy is not very creative. What a waste of my time. Too bad.
5,Absolutely Hilarious!!!,"I got this book at the pro shop of my course and laughed the entire round. I'm glad I can finally give my dad a good fathers day present this year. Get it, you'll laugh your pants off."
4,Cooper is Great,"First, let me say it must be me in that I could not relate to Dallas and The Wreck of the Mary Deare. However this is a fine collection of Gary Cooper movies and Sergeant York was especially outstanding. The second disk of Sergeant York gave a lot of good information about the making of the movie and was interesting. I would recommend this collection to Cooper fans. Maybe it is just the passage of time that made two movies a little out of date."
5,More great movies of Coop,"On this special edition you get 5 movies of Gary Cooper. With Sargent York you can see the film that GC won his first Oscar, this film came with an extra DVD. The other movies are of the late 40s and 50s. Great edition, all movies come with Spanish subtitles."
1,Springfield Rifle of Gary Cooper Signature collection,This video doesn't work and having a hard time getting the company to replace it. I have emailed them and they sent me a down load telling me how to fix it. I followed all the directions and it still doesn't work. I am tired messing around with this company.
1,Not the same product,I am not very happy with the product that I got. I seen the picture of the 5600 C4 gold reel and I thought that is what I was getting. when it arrived I ended up getting the 4500 C4 that is blue. I bought it as a Christmas present and I feel that my fiance isn't going to be very happy with it either. I will not shop through this place again. I would love to be able to contact them so that I can send it back and get my money back or see if they have the product that is pictured. I have never been so disappointed with anyone on Amazon and I order from this site all the time.
4,Seiko Champagne face,"This watch face is for young eyes. Without glasses or young vision, the face is a difficult glare. With such, it is a beauty of elegant style."
2,SmartMedia Card Reader,"This unit works great. I have never had any problems with it. Now, I would not be without it. The transfer rate is fast, as advertised, and this device is easy to use. I love it."
3,"Beware, Conflicts Exist.","I have 2 of these SanDisk USB readers (they will read only 1 type of memory card, so if you have devices with CompactFlash, MultiMediaCard memory, SmartMedia, etc., you'll need 1 reader per format). They can be difficult to set-up, as the software (in both cases) required an update from their website (nice site, user-friendly) and, more importantly, there are known conflicts with other device drivers you may have on your computer (such as CD-RW drives and Zip drives). While these conflicts are mentioned on the SanDisk website, the solutions they offered were not always helpful. Once solved, this device is great. I have since purchased the Viking reader and have encountered no conflicts at all."
4,Quick way to download pictures,"I own a Canon Digital Elph camera that uses CF cards. I purchased this reader so that I wouldn't have to hook up my camera to the computer (and run down the batteries) each time I wanted to download photos.The drivers installed easily, and I haven't had a single problem with it. I suspect that the other guy just has some weird software incompatibility issue that could happen with any device or software."
1,No drivers for Windows XP,"There are currently NO drivers available for this product for Windows XP.The SanDisk web site simply says ""this device is not supported in Windows XP"" There is no promise for creation of new Windows XP drivers."
5,Works great,This product works fine under Windows 2000. As long as you download the most recent drivers from the website. Why not? Can beat this little guy.
1,"Don't do it, pay for quality","I just bought a digital camera so wanted a card reader to easily get to the pictures. I didn't need anything fancy so went with this one. MISTAKE. As other reviewers have stated, conflicts exist. I couldn't even get the software to install on my Win98 machine and [their website] is no help whatsoever. There is no good information on this error and you cannot even search on their new site without unknown page web errors. You can download the instruction manual, but it is just the 5 page quick start manual which came in my box. Gee, thanks. One reviewer mentioned that he needed a software update, but I couldn't even find that. I am returning this item and going with a more solid product like Viking's. Don't bother with this one unless you want to spend a lot of time with installing it (or are just lucky!)"
1,SanDisk Smart Media Card Reader,"I recently purchased two SanDisk card readers to transfer images from a digital camera to my computers. After several successful transfers, both computers began to freeze-up during data transfer. SanDisk's web site provided an updated driver, which did not resolve the problem. I also followed SanDisk's instructions for formatting the Smart Media card, but the freeze-ups continue. I am now researching an alternate brand of card reader, and other methods of image transfer...this card reader does not appear to be reliable."
1,avoid this device it will cost you more then its worth,I READ ALL THE REVIEWS GOOD AND BAD ON THIS ITEM AND I WENT AHEAD AND BOUGHT IT AND YES I DID EXPERINCE READING ERRORS ON IT AFTER VIEWING A FEW PICS THE THE DRIVE WOULD SHUT DOWN THIS BECAME ANNOYING I HAVE 3 SMARTMEDIA DISK TO OF WHICH CAME BRAND NEW THE SAME DAY AS THE DRIVE WHAT I NOTICED WAS MY OLD DISK WAS ALL SCRATCHED ON THE BOTTOM I THOUGHT HOW IS THIS SO TO TEST I PUT A NEW DISK IN MY CAMERA PULLED IT IN AN OUT AN NO SCRATCH NEXT I PUT A NEW DISK IN THE SANDISK READER PULLED IT OUT AND TO NEW GROVES SCRATCHED IN IT AFTER PULLING MY OLD DISK IN AN OUT AFEW TIMES OVER THE PAST 2 DAYS IT HAD VERY VISIBLE GROVES AND WAS NOW UNREADABLE BY CAM OR SANDISK SO AVOID THIS PRODUCT NOT FOR READ ERROR BUT FOR DAMAGE IT DOES TO YOUR SMARTMEDIA CARDS
4,A Simple Reader For The Desktop,"The unit is sligtly large but un my opinion thats the advantage of it, its sit comfortably on you desk and doesn't slide or get knocked around like other readers. Its a little odd looking though, with an LED on each side of the slot your friend might mistake it for some kind of toy animal!I purchased the reader to work with my Handspring Visor, through the use of a MemPlug SmartMedia Adaptor, and it works fabulously. Setup was very easy on my desktop running Win2000 and I've had no problems. One thing to remember though, you should always right-click on the drive icon (I made a shortcut on my desktop) and choose eject from the menu or else you can end up with corrupt databases that have not been completely transferred."
2,"Fast, but not worth it","I bought this reader a couple months after receving my digital camera and had nothing but problems. We followed the advice on the website [downloaded the driver] and still had problems. Yes the download speed was very fast compared to using the serial port, but the problems I encountered were not worth it. Using the SanDisk caused my computer to freeze repeatedly, I had to reformat my disk more than once, and even lost almost 200 photos once. Now it just sits and collects dust and I put up with the serial port to download to my computer."
1,SanDisk SDDR-09-01 USB SmartMedia Reader,Running Windows 2000 with USB PCI card. Horrible time with the reader. Still not set up. Technical Support in my opinion non-existant although a couple of nice guys there. In fairness to Sandisk problem could be my Windows 2000 or the USB PCI card. Even thinking of going back to Windows 98 to see if solves the problem. NOt sure if sorry I bought device or not.
1,Stability is totally unpredictable,"I have over a year of frustrating experience with this product running under WinME. The thing constantly locks up. The only way I can get it to be even slightly stable is to reboot between reading cards. Otherwise the system locks up whenever going from one card to the next. Horrible drivers. My experience with it on Win2000 was too short to be sure, but having to live with this product has been bad enough. I hardly use it now, but I'm disappointed to see that I'll likely have to throw it away when I go to WinXP. No matter, it's barely worked anyway."
1,Pure Garbage,"This device is pure garbage if you use Windows 2000. Unstable, flaky, and unreliable... this is one of the worst devices I've ever bought. I even updated to the latest drivers, to no avail.The problems weren't limited to my machine, as my friend bought the same device and experienced the same problems.Please, do yourself a favor and avoid it."
1,don't try it if you have W95 OSR2,"both the web site and the documentation with the device say it can be used with W95 OSR2 - I spent much time with much pain trying to make it do so. I have no additional devices on this machine and I don't appear to have any other devices running with known conflicts - no Zip, no CD-R, no other USB. Ugly system crashes. Returned it for the Viking Intelliflash - while that didn't work great with W95 either, at least the machine wasn't crashing. Ended up upgrading to 98 and kept the Viking - which now works fabulously. Maybe the Sandisk would have worked with 98 but I had already returned it and the Viking Support desk was great."
2,Poor technical support,"I was given this card reader by my father that swares by them , I used it on his comp while on vacation and it was great took it home to use it on mine and no go . It says the device does not respond to the drivers . I have contacted the company twice through email and have loaded and unloaded the software too many times to count as well as remove and reinstall my CDR/RW . Conflicts may possibly exist with Windows Me ,if I get a response back I will let you all know ."
1,Not compatible with laptops,"I agree with another writer who said it wasn't compatible with Dell Laptops. I had a similar problem and tech support was trying to get me to change my startup menu telling me too many programs were running at once and causing the problems because there wasn't enough memory which is totally not the case. This thing is crap and I'm definitely returning it for another brand. We had one from Zio that we lost, but it worked much better."
4,This book is very good,"This book is very good, and the way it is laid out is well thought out. Each area of the state is put in to zones that can be pointed to and say, this railroad was here or is here. And that one was down there. I really liked the area that is around New York City, "" The Gateway area."" It tells you where it is in a nutshell."
5,The Golden Age of Hollywood from an Insider,"When Hollywood first started to shine golden, Ed Bernds was there. He knew and worked with the stars, the directors and the writers, and contributed no little himself to Hollywood's Golden Age. In ""Mr. Bernds Goes To Hollywood,"" Ed tells -- with near total recall -- of his journey to the movie capital in the earliest days of sound (which was his speciality) and of his career at Columbia Studios, the King of ""Poverty Row,"" with the likes of Frank Capra, Clark Gable and the feared studio head Harry Cohn. In telling his story, Bernds invokes a bygone era of Hollywood glamor with an inside knowledge that few today possess. Necessary books on Hollywood are few and far between, but ""Mr. Bernds Goes To Hollywood"" fills the bill."
1,Not all stainless steel.,"I ordered these for a wet location, they arrived and the tightening screws are not stainless steel as stated in the product description, the bands are stainless steel. The company made it difficult to return the items, I had to pay shipping."
4,Still Going,"I am reviewing this grinder even though I purchased it years ago. I have tried and tried to kill this thing, but it won't die! Lots and lots of torque. Very happy with its cutting and grinding capabilities. It is kinda huge, and a little scary when it decides to stick, but it does what it's told and I can't seem to break it yet!"
4,Good torque and balance,"This grinder replaced a very old and very heavy 9"" grinder. The DeWalt provides plenty of torque. I have used it with the Blue Boar 6"" core bits to make holes in cinder block and the grinder had power to spare. With a flexible backing pad it makes an excellent sander for decks and other large projects."
1,What item?,I filed a claim two days ago that I had not received this item. I contacted the seller and never heard back prior to filing a claim.
4,Outlook 2003 is the big upgrade for me. Do you need the rest?,"Now that outlook does not download images by default. Spammers cannot tell if you opened up their email. And, for the same reason, if you like auto preview but turned it off because of potential malicious code you can fell more comfortable using it again. Another big help for those of you who use rules but had to keep your entire folder tree open to see if you have new email. Now there is an unread email view which groups by folder. Make sure you flag emails for follow up, because if you start using your unread folder view as you used your inbox in the past, read emails will disappear and you will forget to respond. Not to worry there is a follow up view as well.As for the other apps I have not used them to the extent that I use Outlook. I only run into new features as I need them and I just have not needed any other new features."
2,getting worse over time,"While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office ""think ahead of me,"" they almost always seem to get it wrong. The result is a package that consistently annoys me. It is true that one can turn off the ""helpful"" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business. In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill. As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice. At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun. While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive. I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently."
1,Microsoft Office Pro 2003,Very disappointed because the product key is wrong. My work totally got delayed. Who would thought the product key could be wrong.
4,"...,it isn't Office 2007 thank goodness","If you hate Office 2007, or are in a work environment that demands everyone be using the same version of office. Get this.2003 was a great product.Or don't get it, so when I need a new copy, there are some left."
3,Like the product - not how it is pictured,"The only thing I was disappointed in was that I just received a CD when I thought I was getting the entire package, i.e., the box that is shown in the advertisement with the manuals, etc. If I had know that I was not getting what was shown I would have just purchased the CD off of E-bay for half the price."
4,Works great!,"This product works fine on windows xp and is just as good as the newer versions. It includes all the necessary programs, such as word, excel, powerpoint, etc., needed to get your work done. I bought this because my new dell netbook didn't have microsoft office and it's turned out to be a good decision."
1,Not happy,It took this seller WEEKS to send me an in-stock item. When it did arrive it was in a cheap mailer that looked like it came from someones house. I would not order from this seller again.
1,LIAR (Not Amazon),"Bought this product from a company named ""TeddySoftware"".I had to return it because the CD couldn't be read.Also the picture isn't what I received.The one I received was a office 2003 pro bulk that's suppose to be sold only with a new computer.So this is a fake product picture."
1,Ripped off!,"Ordered product never arrived, repeated emails without response, and a filed complaint with Amazon and no satisfaction leave me feeling ripped off! I'll NEVER order another product for my business through Amazon."
1,Microsoft Office Professional 2003 {OLD VERSION],http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AZJVC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI was disappointed when I found that this version didn't contain Microsoft visio. I suggest that you add to the advertisement the list of software that each version of Microsoft Office provides.
2,Microsoft Office Pro 2003,When we received the software it wouldn't work and we had to return it. There was no problem returning the item and getting refunded. The seller was very pleasant and easy to work with.
1,Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003 ( Old Version ),"While I was pleased with the ease of placing the order of purchased product, I was not happy when I received the order. The product was advertised as new in orginal box. It was not shipped in the orginal container and was not new or was somehow defective. Perhaps the sellars should be held to a higher level of accountability in their advertising."
3,Microsoft Office 2003 Review,"Microsoft Office Professional 2003 [OLD VERSION] To anyone who reads this; I would be able to rate this product if I received it. I was promised delivery of said product between September 26th and October 13th. As of today, October 23rd, I still have not received the software. It would be appreciated if someone recieving this transmission would forward it to someone who could look into this matter. Needless to say, my reaction has gone from concerned to miffed!"
1,Disk didn't work!!!!!,"THE DISK DIDN'T WORK! It was defective & would not load! We had to remove our old version before installing this new one & then THE DISK WOULDN'T LOAD!!We have a home-based business & this caused a HUGE hardship for us!We asked for an immediate replacement, but instead, received a refund a few days later. Not worth the inconvenience, nightmare & downtime! This cost us time & business!I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS SELLER! The only good thing I can say about them is they DID give us a refund after several days of downtime."
2,review of 2003,The microsoft really messed up on this one. This is nothing more than Microsoft Office Professional 2003 [OLD VERSION] warmed over and has way too many options. I found it difficult to use.
3,Vendor issues,Vendor intially sent the wrong product but then sent the right version. The problem is that I had already purchased a replacement. Now I will probably sell the extra one. He made good but should have emailed me right away after I notified him. Windows office 2003 is however the stable version I needed.
1,Aware of Counterfeit Copy,"Please be aware of those cheap office professional 2003. After buying it, make sure you call up Microsoft to verify whether your copy is an original copy. I had mine verified and found out to be a counterfeit copy."
1,Totally Dis-Satisfied,I have wrote several times to this vendor trying to get credit for this purchase or return of my funds to no avail. I have also request a trade for a like product which has also not met with any response from this vendor. I will never buy another product from this vendor and will not probably purchase via Amazon again.
1,Damaged Goods,"Received software but my CD rom would not read the disc! I tried it on 2 other systems as well, so I know it was not my system. I e-mailed the seller and go no response! I am currently disputing the charges with American Express. Seller has yet to make good on this purchase.Joe"
1,OEM Software,"Despite the pictures and what is advertised on the Amazon website, the product sent by Fund-star is merely an envelope with a CD indicating OEM software, which is not transferable between computers and does not include the same level of technical support. Fund-star did refund my money once the CD was returned unopened, but if you are not looking for OEM software, avoid buying from this vendor."
5,Microsoft Office Professional 2003 - Old Version,"Great, it was as advertised, and competitively priced against other products that I saw. I would purchase from this site again"
1,"Liked the 2000 Version better, and no activation","2003 was expensive and with no real features I was after. That said, the disk broke, and,MSFT would not replace the disk. That's why it's getting one star."
1,Bad CD,"The CD was full of read errors. During installation, I kept getting the message, Do you want to retry reading the file. After selecting the retry option several times, I was able to install Word and Excel, but some files could not be read and had to be downloaded from the Microsoft website. The software is great, but beware of Disk errors."
1,Where's my merchandise?,"I will never buy from this company again. I didn't receive my merchandise on time. I contacted them atleaset 4 times and they never responded. I paid by paypal, so they got their money but I never received my merchandise or heard from them. Buyers Beware!!"
1,Induced compulsion to upgrade software,"Why should the average user spend lots of money, which in turn corresponds to a considerable quantity of sweated work time, which in turn corresponds to time taken away from one's own interests, family and friends, just to buy a new version of an Office suite ? The same job of a new version of, say, a wordprocessor, can basically still be done by a word processor of 20 years ago. Do we really need all these improvements, all these animations, these ""cute effects"" etc. when what we need is simply write a letter or a report and spell-check it? In most cases not at all. But software houses are very good at inducing people to buy their products and let them believe the new version will make them save time: but to save that time they have to work more to pay the bill.This induced compulsion to ever upgrade one's systems is becominng an manipulative invisible taxation system. Much better to use free producs: OpenOffice.org or any other."
2,"Good product, but not worth the money","Office 2003 is an excellent program. Despite what people say, it does have some nice features that Office XP did not (spam filter for instance). However, for $400, it's just not worth it. If it wasy say $150, I might be able to recomend it. But with it's current rediculous price tag, I just can't."
4,Only if you're serious,"I have been using Microsoft Office for at least 10 years, pretty much day in and day out at work. Some computer geek in a store convinced me that Open Office on my home computer would do everthing for me that MS did, and it was free. Well, I'm all about ""free,"" so I gave it a shot. Maybe if all you do is type letters and balance your checkbook, Open Office will do the trick. But if you are a serious office product user, Open Office does not touch the functionality of MS. And believe me, I WANTED it to work. I had $500 riding on it! But I finally gave in. Yep, they've got me. I hated to drop the cash, but there's no real competition. So I guess it depends upon how much functionality you really need. I will probably load Open Office onto the other computers for ""incidental"" use, but I doubt I will ever wean off of MS."
5,Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003,This is the newest version of Microsoft Office. I think this is the best also because they have added programs that you couldn't get with 2000 or XP. They include:Microsoft Word 2003Microsoft Outlook 2003 with Business Contact ManagerMicrosoft Excel 2003Microsoft Access 2003Microsoft PowerPoint 2003Microsoft Publisher 2003Word 2003 has really improved and it has much more fonts than the older versions. I love PowerPoint now and I use it a lot with work and just sometimes to fool around with. Outlook has finally gotten a new look to it which looks awesome. Publisher has even more things you can do with it. Excel has become a little bit easier with more things built into though. I love Office 2003 and no other company can even compare to it.
1,Microsoft office professional,Don't order from this personHe hasn't returned my money and he gave me a product key that was inactivethanksjames proch
1,Use Open Office - It's Free !!!,"If you want an alternative to MS Office, that is also compatible with MS Office, use Open Office. You can find it under the Google search term Open Office. It's a free download, and just as good as Office 2003. You get a Word application, a spreadsheet application, and a PowerPoint application. All are compatible with Office 2003."
1,Hard to review what you never recieved!,"I would love to review this product, but you see, as yet, I have not received it. It's now been over a month since the charge was registered on the account. That happened almost immediately! Neither the seller or the Amazon A to Z Guarantee people have responded to my inquiries. And of course, finding a phone number to talk to a recording or even better yet, a live person is beyond the scope of available information. So here's my review, since you asked. Not that it will do me any good, but at least the next customer will have a clue into the kind of experience that awaits. I hope this has been fun! After all, that is what makes for a good review..."
1,Not like advertised,I was disappointed in this purchase. I did try to contact the seller and got no response. The disc they sent me did not work on either of my computers and I needed it for a class. I guess I am just out 90.00.
3,It is what it says it is: a guide.,"If you're looking for a practical and comprehensive guide to daily living as a Jew, this book is excellent in terms of the material that it offers. It covers all the bases, most of the time in sufficient detail that one finishes a section with complete understanding.It is written in sections or chapters which enable one to go from the front to the back to the middle of the book without losing anything by the detours. It's really a cookbook.If it has any serious fault it would be in the fact that the writer, Rabbi Lamm, tends to be a bit wordy at times, to be a bit too dry much of the time, and, perhaps (to mix religions) a bit too pontifical at times.Still, I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know the nuts and bolts of Jewish observance in contemporary life. It offers that, and, in that sense, it is what it says it is: A guide."
5,Great information,"I am still reading it, actually more like studying it. The explanations helped me understand things I had misunderstood all my life. I highly recommend it."
4,Great resource,This book is a great resource for those living a Jewish lifestyle. If you were not raised as a practicing Jew this book is a MUST for you! You will learn about how to live out your Jewish identity throughout the pages of this wonderful book! Nicely written with great Table of Contents. Strongly recommend for anyone new to Judaism or returning to their faith.
1,ewwwww,"this is the most horrific album i've ever heard! he's making comments about how he can't take another clay aiken album, jc should really look at the junk he's putting out. do yourselves a favor and save your money!"
1,Warning,"Warning: Listening to this CD may give you chronic diarrhea, migraines, mental retardation, gas, and a strange urge to stick a knife into an outlet."
1,Don't bother,Do yourself a favor and buy a Craig David cd instead. Craig does it much better. JC Chasez is simply pretending to have soul. Craig actually **has** soul.
1,QUE PORQUERIA.......ESTE TIPO EN QUE ESTABA PENSANDO,"ESTE TIPO ESTA LOCO SI PIENSA QUE PUEDE SER MEJOR QUE SU COLEGA JUSTIN Y LLEGAR A SER MAS FAMOSO CON ESTA TREMENDA PORQUERIA, PONGAMONOS A PENSAR Y DE CADA GRUPO LOS INTEGRANTES QUE SE LANZAN COMO SOLISTAS SOLO UNO TIENE GRAN EXITO EMPEZEMOS......LOS BACSTREETBOYS SE LANZO NICK CARTER Y NO TUBO EXITO LASTIMA ADEM,AS FALTA OTRO DE ESE GRUPO PARA QUE SE COMPRUEBE MI ANALIZIS.......DE LAS DESTINYS CHILD MICHELLE FLOP FLOP KELLY ROWLAND NO FUE TAN MALO EN VENTAS PERO NADA COMPARADO CON EL HIT DE BEYONCE QUE IMPACTO MUCHO..........AL IGUAL QUE ESTE JC FLOP FLOP FLOP.PORQUE NO PODRA IMPACTAR COMO JUSTIN"
1,BRILLIANT CONCEPT!,"LETS HAVE A GUY IN HIS EARLY 20'S GET ALL DRESSED UP AND SING LOVE/SEX SONGS THAT DONT SHOW OFF ANY VOCAL TALENT, THROW SOME UNINSPIRED BEATS AND SYNTHESIZERS OVER TOP OF IT, AND WA-LA! A MASTERPEICE!"
4,better than justin?,"wasn't a fan of nsync, though i did like there later stuff, bought this albulm cause i liked the beat on blowing me up and im not dissapointed. Its not a masterpiece but it is very good and very original! I would say it was better than justin as i still see him as i michael jackson rip-off (although i cannot deny he does have talent - i've seen him live at n.e.r.d, he's good!) Justin's albumn relys on excellent production with help from n.e.r.d and timbaland, whilst this seems to be more of a personal project, and a very good one at that!"
4,Excellent voice holds together refreshingly eclectic album,"I must admit that I have been following JC Chasez's career for many years, and it has been delightful to see him developing from a promising teenager into a mature artist. This CD is the first, but hopefully not the last, expression of his mature talent. Although his music depends on a great many influences, and often borrows from them, he packages it in a unique way- using familiar sounds in unexpected contexts. The album thus manages to appeal to our desire for the comforts of famililarity, while maintaining a freshness and variety which is sorely lacking in many current albums. There is something for almost every taste- from electronica, to 80s pop, to cheeky rock, to playful R&B, to soaring ballads. Holding all of these together are Chasez's voice, which is not only technically proficient, but manages to bend itself to fit the mood and needs of each song and style, while maintaing the distinctive essense which makes it all his own."
4,Surprisingly fantastic,"I took a gamble buying this album without listening to it first, and for once the gamble paid off. The album is well designed, even though the songs are an eclectic mix. Many critics have said the ""music is all over the place,"" but that's better than the alternative where all the songs on the cd sound the same (Madonna's American Life, anyone?)Yes, JC is very reminiscent of Prince both in vocals and theme, but this music is fresh and vibrant. Don't make the mistake of type-casting the album/artist as ""boy band."" Buy it, you won't be disappointed."
4,hot....,"this is good... it jus showcases TALENT that Justin lacked a bit on Justified. They are quite different, but all I have to say is this is good... VERY DIFFERENT N EXCITIN"
3,Sexy And Interesting Effort But....,"I really respect JC for going outon a limb and doing something different.Most all of the songs have a differentgroove. He is not out to ""Bling-Bling""you. Highlights include ""Some Girls Dance"",""Build My World"", and of course, ""Blowin' MeUp With Her Love"". However hot the music ishere, JC is not much of a vocalist. Or ratherhis style is rather non-descript and does notkeep me interested for long. 17 tracks of JCis way too much."
5,JC Chasesz goes the distance,"With ballads like Lose Yourself, Dear Goodbye, and Build My World to playful songs like ADIDAS, 100 Ways and Some Girls this album has something for everyone. Throw in a little Basement Jaxx song called Shake It,a very Sting sounding song called Everything you want and you have one of the best collections of different songs to be offered up on one album. You never have a chance to get bored with the ever changing style of music that is offered here. Well worth the listen."
4,Not your average pop,"Chasez out does himself on this and we FINALLY get to hear the talent that I always knew was hiding under Justin. (Sorry JRT) JC is all grown up and shows his gifts on this CD. I do issue a warning! This is NOT for a young crowd. Moms, listen to this CD before buying it for your kids! It is sexually charged. It is meant for the 18 and up group. Every song on this CD has some sort of sexual innuendo! But, it is great! Every song is very different, from dance to calm and soulful. I bought it the day it came out and it has not left my CD player."
1,"Oooooops, you missed!","This CD is crap! I bought it after hearing the 2 good songs: ""Blowin me up with her love"" and ""Some Girls"". After hearing those 2 songs I expected it to have more of a R & B/Hip Hop feel to it....I was wrong! I know it's called Schizophrenic...but, it's a little too all over the map for me! Which was obviously the purpose of it. But, he cannot pull it off. Not a strong voice & not a very good writer either. Very disappointed in this CD. I expected better. Not worth it!!!!"
1,Disappointing,"I was really curious about this. JC is an amazing vocalist, but this album does him no justice. It';s basicly a look in the mind of a sex-crazed teenager. I read really good reviews on this album, but I don't understand where they are coming from. The songs are awful. The one shining moment is ""Build My World."" Why do these former mousekateers turn into such sexual beasts? Was it a a part of their training on ""The Mouse Club?"" Well, at least Britney and Christina have decent songs. Jc, try again."
2,Very Disappointed,"JC Chasez is a very talented vocalist and dancer. He can hit high notes as well as low notes. I've always thought that he was one of the boys in *NSYNC who most deserved a recording contract. When I saw that he had a solo album, I thought to myself, no surprise. And I've personally always thought he was more handsome then Justin Timberlake. Anyway, I looked over his album, ready to be impressed...but I was everything but that.It's obvious JC has gone over to what I refer to as ""the dark side"". He's singing slow songs that if he didn't sing about trashiness and garbage, would have no appeal. I expected him to turn out better then Justin Timberlake, but I guess I expected too much."
1,His Voice is good but the songs are not.,"I just have one question,where the hell is the emotion on this CD? Almost every song is about sex and there really not even good songs.JC's voice is very good but almost none of the songs actually show his talent. The only songs i really like on this Cd are build my world and blowin me up,other then that it seems to be all trash.I was really excitied about this CD but now that ive heard it, i wish i never wasted my money.Compared to Justified this CD is a joke,Jc needs to go back to singing Justin's backup."
1,ABSOLUTE FILTH!!,"This is one of the most disgusting collections of music I have ever heard. It seems as though every song has a graphic sexual message. As a member of the former cute boy band N Sync, Chasez should realize the fan base he has. It is mostly girls under the age of 16.Chasez is either eager to escape his boy band past..... He needs better songwriters and a greater understanding of his core audience. Chasez is selling a CD of adult music to a non-adult audience. No one over the age of 18 is going to be interested in a teen idol unless they suffer from stunted development.Chasez needs to reevaluate his music options, or risk becoming a cartoonish male version of Britney Spears."
1,"Aw come on JC, just come out of the closet.","JC is desperately trying to look straight after leaving the fab five, but it just isn't working. He sings ""some girls dance with girls"" when you know he's thinking ""some boys dance with boys"" Well, look on the bright side, it's not as gay as Justin's ""Justified"". Now excuse me while I b*tch smack them both."
5,Schizo-phonic,"Brilliant is all i've got 2 say - This album deserves to do as well as JT's Jusitified, but will it? NO, which is a crime. I wont attempt to reveiew the album track by track cos i'll B here 4 EVA. All of the tracks are good and I was most surprised. If your considering purchasing, U wont B disappointed. JC U rock my world"
5,finally!,"After much delay...hi cd finally came out. But I was not disappointed. This is one of the best cds i have heard in a while. JC has such a versatile voice and an ecclectic collection of music that he can pull it all off. forget JT, JC is the new lead singer of NSYNC!"
2,Weak album,"This album is HORRENDOUS, Justin did a much better job with his solo effort than Jc did. pick up JT's album ""Justified"" instead or if you want a hot album get Janet's ""Damita Jo"" in stores March 30th."
1,Worst Album for a Fluff,Vocally others are as good if not better.Why if someone is so great they sound like the greats before him.
1,oh......it's not that good,"This is not a worth CD,the whole style of it is just dirty pop...I admit this guy's voice is not bad,but his music sucks,and it can't be called a complete CD because the songs are not associated well,every song is so separate from each other and the lyrics are bad!don't buy it."
4,100 Ways - Have a Listen,This whole CD kicks it. 100 Ways / Come To Me are very likely to become hits. No overproduction and a nice debut. Exactly what I expected from Mr. JC. The wait was well worth it.
5,AWESOME!!!,"I wanted to get JC's album when it came out and well it had been sold out in the store where I usually buy music. I just got it today and WOW it's really cool his music is awesome and I can't stop listening to his music. You just got to be a fan to like him as an artist and his music. I am a fan of JC and I am happy for him, I think it's better than Timberlake's and good luck trying competing with him but believe me you are both great singers and I hope you guys continue to make music for ever."
3,"Different, average","While SCHIZOPHRENIC is a highly ambitious album, it is average in many ways. J.C.'s voice is thinner than his natural comparison, Justin. One thing that J.C. does do better than Justin is that he allows SCHIZOPHRENIC to be more adventurous than JUSTIFIED was. The thing is that adventurousness comes at a cost. The album is too adventurous. There is too much material (16 tracks is way over the limit in this case) and there is no set genre that J.C. uses as the basis of SCHIZOPHRENIC. Also, the songs just don't have the spark that say JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE'S songs have composition and performance wise. 2 Top picks spring from this merely average album: ""SOME GIRLS (DANCE WITH WOMEN)"" and ""ALL DAY LONG I DREAM ABOUT SEX"". 3 stars."
1,Album should be titled Nymphomaniac,Quick someone get this guy a woman he needs to get laid sooooooo bad!Okay I am a young 22 year old hot-blooded american woman. I like sex just as much as the next person but whoa just about every song on this album is about sex and it gets old real quick (the visuals are terrifying...dripping in the hallway and the kitchen table and such uuuuhhhh yuck!). The songs that aren't about sex do not showcase what an awesome voice this guy has and lyrically speaking this album is beyond poor. I just expected so much more from him...I really wanted to like this cd. The only good thing you can take away from this album is a good laugh... and maybe some nostalgic 80s back beats. Sorry JC better luck next time.
2,What a waste of star potential,"If you truly are a fan of JC then you will be honest about this album. Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex! That is what his album is about. Now don't get me wrong, JC is a very sensual and sexy individual but it seems as if he was tyring way too hard to sell himself in that light not knowing that his voice is the source of his sex appeal. What a shame. I am so disappointed in him as an artist. The best songs on the album seem to be ""She got me, Come To Me, Dear Goodbye, Everything You Want, and Lose Myself"" and they aren't even that great.The fact of the matter is that NSYNC is nothing without each other, not even Mr. Timberlake to whom that fans can blame for the dismnatling of the band. I love you JC but better luck next time if there is one. And for the sake of all your fans and yourself, I hope there is another chance in the future"
1,Simply Awful,"I bought this CD today hoping to hear that wonderfully tender melodic voice from ""Drive Myself Crazy"" from his NSYNC days but instead all this CD is about is chicks and how much he wants to have sex with them. Nothing wrong with that but almost every song had a similar theme with too much electronic studio noise which overshadows JC's incredible voice. He has the looks and the magnetism to go far in the biz but not with this kind of musical style which is better suited to one of the many brilliant African-American male vocalists out there or even Justin Timberlake could have done better with these songs. Keep looking JC you will eventually find your niche but this ain't it."
2,JC IS DA SEX BOMB!!!,"I Have eagerly awaited JC's new album. He was always my favorite in N'sysc. His voice and singing style is awesome. The music on this album is great. Great dance beats, fast and slow. And yet I was very disappointed when I listened to it.The lyrics just have too much sex in it. When I listen to music I always sing along; out loud or to myself. I can't sing along with this album.When I say too much sex, I mean verses like in the song ""Come To Me."" ...Now, while I would defend anyone's right to Masturbate, I simply cannot sing that. Or dance to it. So when I say the album is filled with too much sex, this is what I mean.I am truly disappointed with his work here and if I could return it I would. He is so very talented. Why sing about Masturbating?It's not very romantic.It's not something I would write to my girlfriend in a Valentine's Day Card. ""I want to Masturbate with you! Be my valentine.""I'm very disappointed in this and in JC."
2,Microsoft Access 2003 (Old Version),"The product was missing instructions, which since it was new should have been with it, when I complained to the company it was bought from they had a convoluted return policy. I kept the product only because I needed it. I would never do business with that company again."

3,ehhh,ehhh the item when shipped in was a little damaged bent corners but overall it was alright. with me its the little things that standout but when it it comes poorly ;caged it standout
5,IF you love the STEELERS you will love the Ultimate collection,Amazing just Amazing the ultimate collection will get you ready for any season of the Steelers!!! diff. this year!!! BUY IT
5,"Great product, fast shipping~","Great product, great communication! Thank you! I love it! Great price!"
5,Great software.,I love Microsoft Office software and this title is no exception. It's very simple to use and great features!
2,Photo support is horrible,"I gave this a 2nd star for a support call ms provided. If you do have a frontpage server, and have it set ""on"", it had some advantages over ftp.I bought it for use on our family website which is mainly pictures. I've used 6-8 programs for creating galleries over the years. I think a perl script using Linux' mogrify worked best. This works worst! The free ones w/ the digital cameras beat it. Frontpage is missing the most fundamental piece to view photos- A next/previous button. You can choose from several thumbnail displays including a cool mosaic/colage type thing. Once you expand it, you must remember the shot you were on, back up, and then click on the next one! Unbelievable.I know what I need for handling photos efficiently. Flicr has it- cross-tab indexing of the same photo. I think picassa is close and getting closer. This wasn't worth the cost of Picassa- FREE."
4,Reply for: Not for a large commercial site!!!,This is a typical answer for someone who does not understand how to use the software. Just another case of some person expecting the carpenter's tools to do the work instead of the carpenter having any skills before using the tools.
1,Deserves 0 Stars!,"This program is useless! Don't waste your hard-earned money on this junk. The interface is horrible, the overall design absolutely makes no sense, and the so-called components won't work.Bottom line is... unless you want to flush your money down the tubes, don't bother buying this.Instead, may I suggest Dreamweaver, or NetObjects Fusion; two very high quality programs."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PERSON!!!,"Disk took 2 weeks to arrive, it was cracked (sent in paper envelope with no protection) and had ""NOT FOR RESALE"" stamped on its front. I attempted numerous times to contact the seller to no avail."
3,"Good Product, Terrible Licensing","FrontPage is powerful and easy to use. My gripe is that Microsoft's licensing for this software is horrible. They state that I can have the software loaded on 2 computers for my own use. I loaded it on both my home and work computer. Unfortunately, my home computer was damaged so I purchased a new one, only to find out that FrontPage wouldn't activate on it because I had already activated it on 2 machines. Now I'm facing a computer upgrade at work and will be unable to use this software at all.Again, it's a good web design tool, but I consider it a software rental, not a purchase. I'll move over to Dreamweaver when it's time to upgrade. DO NOT load this software if you plan on upgrading your computer any time soon."
4,pretty powerful,"Given my limited knowledge of computer science and programming i felt FrontPage was a a really big help. I was able to get a website up and running in about 2 weeks which i think is pretty good all things considering. I didn't realize though that Frontpage isn't the cureall for making a website really. Primarily only for WEB DESIGN i.e. if you want to make a website with E-commerce and query searches of an inventory database and the like, you're gonna need to bring in the professional programmers in any event to program in ASP or PHP. But as far as Web Design goes Frontpage can take a novice a long way."
5,You have the right to read this book....NOW!,"I remember at one time I thought about being a policewoman. Even took the test, passed and got a letter to appear for training. Never did follow up on it. Couldn't see myself packing heat in the long run and didn't think I'd be up for horsey patrol right out of the police academy. And after reading this book I know I made the right decision. Being a policeman is no easy job and being a woman cop is even harder, forever proving yourself worthy of the profession. And after reading this book the media only gives half of what is really going on in the streets. This book is an eye opener. It shocked me, sickened me and saddened me but it was never ever boring. It really made an impact on me and made me more aware of a policeperson's life. This is one of my favorite books and I just ordered Crime Scenes so I could read more. Gina, I hope you sold the rights to this book either as a movie or a cable TV series. It deserves it."
1,Not safe for toddlers,"We had this for a while, it worked fine, until our baby got to the toddler stage, and kept pulling on the shade. As a result I found her one day playing with a metal rod she had extracted from the shade!Not very kid friendly!"
5,Good Read,"Very detailed and well-written account of the greatest rock and roll album ever made. To be honest, I would've preferred a few hundred more pages about Exile, but Janovitz crams a lot into this little book. Worth multiple readings if you're a big fan of the album."
4,Great listeners guide to the album,"This book functions as more of a listener's guide than a historical inside look at the sessions. While Janovitz does not unearth a ton of new information on Exile, I found his writing to be quite engaging. He points out nuances buried in this muddy recording that I had not heard before despite having listened to the album dozens of times previously. Janovitz accomplishes what any good piece of rock writing should do, and that is make you want to listen to what they are writing about.I would contrast this book with Andy Miller's book on the Kinks' Village Green album, which is loaded with historical anecdotes and factoids, but is bit dry from a literary standpoint. I struggled to get through Miller's book, but flew through Janovitz's book."
4,Great book for casual Stones fans (like me),"I am not a Stones scholar. If you're one, you'll probably want more minutae about the making of this album, and I don't blame you. A lot of analysis of the songs, rather than the making of the album. Can such a book be done? I don't know, but this was a very entertaining read for me."
2,Not the best....,"This is more of a long critical essay/appreciation of the record than an informative book about the making of the record. Only a few facts are really shared, most are the author's opinions. I mean who cares how this record made him feel as a teenager? - I was looking for more in-depth info about the band, the only first hand info shared is brief and from people from the fringes of the Stones camp. Wikipedia probably gives just as much info."
1,This book is lame,"This ""book"" reads more like a high school term paper. It was so bogged down with bloated quotes from other (and better) books on the subject that you get the impression the author stayed up the night before his deadline trying to come up with enough words to meet his editor's requirement. Short both on facts and insight, this book offers very little."
1,Tough read,This writer is annoying. I could barely read this nonsense. I am going to buy another book and chuck this one. I wore out two LP's of this album.
2,Ran very small.,"This is super soft, but ran small. I'm a 12/14 and it fits too snugly to wear on it's own. Very cute though. Just buy up a size."
2,Inexpensive Chinois,"I returned this item. I was looking for a very fine strainer while this was actually a pierced metal strainer, making it too coarse for my needs. Otherwise the unit was of good quality. The holes are much finer than a typical collander, so it could meet someone else's needs better than mine."
1,Just plain junk !,"I do not recommend this cheap tester, I used this tester 3 times in 2012 and It was very hard to see if the lights are lit when using it. I stored it in my shed over the winter, I went to use it again and it will not work anymore.Wow...it just quits working all on its own by just sitting in a shed ! Unbelievable !!! This is just plain junk, don't waist your money on this product."
4,Does a good job but hard to read in sunlight,"This tester worked fine on my electric fence. It seemed to give accurate readings and was very easy to use. As others probably mentioned though, it is hard to see the indicator lights in bright sunlight. I'd also only purchase this tester if you intend to store it indoors as it is not the sturdiest tool and may rust if left out in a barn."
4,Good book,"This book was very well researched and I found it to be very informative. The author did a good job of presenting historical events in an interesting way. Unlike many historical research books that I've read, the author was able to capture my attention and keep me excited to turn the page throughout the book."
4,Well-written and thought out,"John Robinson's first tale was his best. In reviewing the history of the Peasant Revolt as a preview of modern Freemasonry and the child of the ancient Templars, he really hit the nail on the head. His book is thoughtful, insightful, and, with the exception of a few minor details, well-researched. A truly satisfying read."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"John J. Robinson epitomizes the way historical researchers/writers should present their findings. There was nothing opinionated, nothing imagined, strictly facts and his own conclusions. Written objectively, truthfully, openly. He laid everything on the table for you, presented his own educated guesses where ever there may have been any gray areas but ensured that the reader knew that this was his conclusions and his conclusions only. There was no attempt to sway anyone's opinions or ideas one way or another. Once I started reading it I could not put it down. I read the entire book in two days! A must read. I promise you that you would not be disappointed. One of the best written books I've ever read !"
2,Interesting but unsupported theory of freemasonry's origin.,"Author starts with a few interesting coincidences, presentsalot of circular reasoning, and asserts that freemasonsoriginated as English Knights Templar who went undergroundafter the order's suppression in early 14th century.Earliest documented evidence of freemasonry dates from mid16th century, and author fails to fill in the gap andjustify his assertion. As a sideline, author gives defenseof freemasonry from charges it is antichristian andconspiratorial."
4,Solid and Enjoyable,"Having read a number of books regarding the Knights Templar recently, this book is solid on the facts and presents a balanced viewpoint based on reality. No fanciful speculation. The linkage from the Templars to the Freemasons is established in a logical way. Great viewpoint on the role of the Freemasons in protestantism. Enjoyable."
5,I would have to say it was very inspiring.,"I to would have to say that this is an excellent book. I was presented with this book just before I did my mm proficency, and it made me all the more prouder to become a Mason. I want people to see just the kind of hell MM went through. I have a daughter and she read it, she has more knowledge then most adults when it comes to knowing about what we stand for, and she is also proud that her Dad is a MM."
3,Born In Blood?,"This book by John J. Robinson was a little easier to read. The first half (The Knights Templar) was pretty much an exact overview of ""Dungeon's Fire and Sword"". I was not real happy about that. The second half (The Freemasons) is really interesting and leaves a lot to think about. It really let's you know how the people were persecuted by the ruling church at that time (shameful). Not a bad book though."
5,A book to read,"This well documented book shows us that what started as a friendship alliance to keep all member alive, ends up in a sect that want to control the world, based on unreal stories, not understandable secret words, and all kind of childish games.We think that freemasonry is just in the one dollar bill, but its tentacles spread all over the world."
3,"If you really want to know the history, this is your book.","Though somewhat tedious at times, this is one of the books to go to if you really want to know about the history of the Knights Templar and of Freemasonry.The first part of the book deals with the history of The Templars, the warrior monks, who were one time protectors of the Church, and then became its biggest target.The second part of the book deals with the ties of modern Freemasonry to those Knights, and discusses symbolism in the rituals and rites of modern Freemasonry.Mr. Robinson goes in depth into the story of religious persecution, the Crusades, and their effect on bringing out the medieval secret society that would later publicly emerge as The Freemasons in 1717.Some people may accuse this book of being somewhat anti-Catholic, but the tone really sets up the reasons why Freemasonry came to be, and why one of the fundamental tennants of it is religious tolerance and freedom of persecution."
4,Real History,This book really give a good look at Masons and explains a lot of items. Although it does not reveal any of the secrets as i hoped. It does give good insight and shows that masons are not as shady as you might think. I would recommend this book to anyone that has thoughts about becoming a mason.
5,The Definitive Answers,"As an educated person and a member of the Fraternity, I can whole heartedly say that this is the truest, most fully researched and logical explanation that I have read regarding the Brotherhood. How Mr. Robinson (now Brother Robinson) was able to compile such information is amazing.To the reluctant buyer I would say that, the author himself was not a member of the fraternity before he wrote this work, but was so impressed with his findings, that he now is a Freemason. Additionally, any serious student or member of Freemasonry will understand that the common ""beliefs"" discussed in other books are really a red herring and are correctly explained and disspelled by Robinson.Furthermore, it is understood by the general membership that Robinson, then as an outsider, hit the nail squarely on the head when he wrote Born in Blood.As a member, I can honestly say, ""If you want the truth, the whole truth, read Born in Blood."
4,A worthwhile read,"Mr. Robinson pushes a few of his theories, on links between the Templars and Freemasons, a bit far at times; but when he does he admits it. He has certainly perked my curiosity on the subject (and that of many other folks judging from the reviews here). His writing style is wonderful and makes the book difficult to put down."
4,Good Set,Bought this for my daughter as a gift and she said the first dvd in the series was very basic but the others she found to be very helpful in teaching her techniques she was unfamiliar with. She also stated that the person who is doing the video was going sometimes too fast and she had to pause and rewind.Otherwise a good buy.
4,"Common Destiny: A Comparative History of the Dutch, French,","This work aims to find similarities between the French, Dutch, and German Social Democratic Parties in the early Postwar years. Comparing ideologies, membership, and activities, this work sees strong similarities between the three parties, while also appreciating the differences between them and ascribing those differences to historical experiences. This work is aimed at the professional scholar but could be grasped by a lay person with some background (i.e., a knowledge of prevailing political trends in the countries during the time period covered). A sophisticated and thoughtful work, it suffers only for its lack of cohesion, something to be expected in this type of work."
1,VERY dangerous product,This product ends up lifting the lower lap belt off of the hips and legs and ON to the stomach and soft tissue. In an accident this product could cause a great deal of internal organ damage. Don't buy this product and destroy any that you are already using! Buy a low back booster seat because this isn't a viable safe option.-Lisacertified car seat tech
1,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered 2 of these for my 4-year old twins' booster seats. What a waste of money. The velcro and snaps are very hard to adjust and hardly ever seemed right no matter how much I tried to set them. Worst of all, the seat belts seem constantly tangled and get stuck in the car door. Save the money and use a hand towel wrapped around the belt near the kids' neck... that will protect the child better than these things!"
4,Good for the big kids,"Good for when you child outgrows backless boosters, and they buckle themselves. Keeps the strap off the neck. I have older vehicles w/o latch and boosters move around with shoulder belt, backless boosters put her above the headrest, so this works well to keep her seated. She has been using this for over a month and she will be 7 yrs. next week. She can adjust it herself. Her only complaint, it's not pink!"
4,Helps with Captain's chair style seats,"If you have a minivan with Captain's chairs, many booster type seats won't work with the incline of the seat. And the safety of the Captain's chair belt support system is compromised if you have to adjust the tilt of the back of the seat. This product works well for me. I changed from the triangular model to the 2 part one and it works much better. Also, the kids can do it up themselves and it is much more user friendly as you don't have to try to pry the fastening end of the seatbelt through the small area of the other model. Remember not for kids under 50 lbs."
2,Pain,"I got this for time when my niece was in my car. She was in the habit of climbing out of her car seat when we'd be driving. Thankfully, this fixed that problem because she can't unbuckle the seat belt. However, this adjuster would come unsnapped at the seat belt would push right on her neck.There is a velcro seat belt adjuster made by Axius available in the automative section of most department stores. It is must easier to adjust and I've had fewer problems with it. My niece no longer has red marks on her name from the seat belt and she's still safe and secure while we're driving."
1,waste of money!!,Mom of 3 kids.I bought this hoping it would be the answer to my daughter's seat belt problem. This would not stay snapped and it was impossible to get the top part to angle correctly away from her face and neck. I returned it the same day.
1,Not Secure,"This product constantly came unsnaped and simply did not work. I bought 2 for the 3rd row of my minivan since I often cart other peoples kids around, but ended up having to go out and get the one piece triangular type instead. So far, they type seems to work much better."
1,Warning - Very Dangerous!,"I am a certified child passenger safety technician. This product and all others like it will cause severe internal injury to children in a crash. If your child is under 4'9"" (like the child in the photo) s/he needs a booster. Seat belts are for adults and big kids (about age 9), and will ride up on their bellies instead of the strong hip bones. This causes ""seat belt syndrome"" and can be fatal."
4,Very handy and not expensive,"I bought one for myself after having actually used one, because of its design.Small easy to carry, wet/dry capability, a hose you don't have to roll up or store taking up extra space, and an oval shape makes it easy to store in its own spot amongst the other tools in the truck.About the size of a wastepaper basket, you can carry it one handed into a clients home or office without having to fight with a big bulky unit and hose.With a light weight plastic 2 gallon tank and a 3.5 amp motor,""It is what it is"". . .and a full size ""Shop Vac"" its not.It's a ""Black & Decker"" so the motor is a little loud and whinny, and it could be more powerful.But its worked better for me then the Dewalt cordless/corded vac, and costs a whole lot less!"
3,vacuum with blower,Seems to be a great value if you want a small portable vacuum cleaner with blower capabilities. Wish the blower output was a little stronger though.
3,Very Complete Book of Card Tricks,This book is great in its completeness and organization. It walks you through most of the card tricks. This book is not geared toward beginners or younger audiences. If you are a visual learner this book is not for you. There are very few pictures and diagrams so you will have to use your imagination at times to visualize what the trick is supposed to look like based on the descriptions.
4,Invaluable book for the closeup magician!!,"This book is great! It has so many tricks that can be worked with various decks. The only bad thing, is that sometimes it is difficult to comprehend. I bought this book for $40 in a magic shop, and that is the price in most magic retailers (of course mine is hardcover, which increses the price) but I thought it was well worth it. Now that I see the Amazon price, I think I got ripped off, but it's still worth it. (I guess I'll check Amazon's price from now on, and maybe shop here.) Overall, it is an excellent book, and I used some great tricks from here for magic auditions. That's how great it is!"
3,Good start,"The title of the book gives a good idea of what is in store. Primarily an information source of magic card tricks.Light on useable information so far as performing is concerned, yet good for the historian.Then again, most magicians are weak performers and strong on history, so this book will be a treat."
4,Quite fun!,"This is a fun and swinging blues CD. Good clean recording. Very peppy. Nice harp. Good for parties, either quiet or loud."
3,"Good, but not the best","I purchased this reed case about eight months ago. It has never broken or come apart in my clarinet bag, so my reeds have stayed safe. It works well in the wintertime, when humidity is lower, but now that it is summer my reeds have started to grow mold on them. Gross! I would recommend this case only for someone in cooler climates."
3,ok case,"I bought this for my daughter for her clarinet reeds, didn't realize you had to buy more charcoal cartridges for it. She didn't use it for very long, didn't work as well as we thought it would."
2,Not one of my favorite references...,"I have been doing medical transcription out of my home for the past four years and have amassed quite a collection of books in that time. This book normally comes highly recommended by other MTs (just see the other reviews), but honestly I was not impressed with it. I would say at least 3 out of 4 times I go to look up a word in The Medical Word Book I cannot find it. As such, I have found myself referring to it much less often; sometimes I give it another chance but more often than not I am left frustrated and have to look elsewhere for my term."
4,Good book for transcription,"This book helped me with vocabulary and pronounciation and it was easy to understand. However, for a more thorough look into anatomy and physiology, I recommend:Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations(Volume 1) (ISBN: 097199919)(Volume 2) (ISBN: 097199927)Buy all three books to help with medical transcription"
4,Good buy...,"The price on this book was excellent...As far as being a helpful MT tool, well I should have given more credence to the other reviewers...Not that helpful...Design is difficult to manuveur...only saving grace is that it's in alphbetical order, but even that's not much help..I will be looking for a better book..."
4,medical word book,"Nice resource for medical transcriptionist getting started. Once you develop your online reseach skills, it might not be as useful but still helpful at times. I purchased mine used so was well worth the money."
3,Sloane's MWB 4th Edition,"Impressive bulk, many different sections such as General Terms, Specialties, Guide to Terminology. There are no visible dividers to show you where the different sections start and end. I use sticky flags, or I could use marks on the edge of the pages if I didn't plan to resell it.Otherwise, very useful book."
5,Nice...relaxing...wonderful...,"This is beautiful work. The nice melodies help me to relax. The spirit of the artist surfaces in each piece...I picture a soft person, spiritually deep, wonderfully loving. The music tranquilizes any moment. The notes echo off the mountains. The melodies rest softly like a fresh-fallen snow. I smile."
3,its ok,"picture is grainy could be on my end but i have not had this problem before, i should have bought the cd next time i will"
4,A little something different in this great series.,"Having followed Lennox Kemp's slow but steady rehabilatation from professional scandal and humiliation, this book offers a back to the future plot as his ex-wife Muriel, the cause of his original downfall, continues to complicate his life even after death. A neat plot twist, but the clues are there for the discerning. Given the author's name, its sometimes nice to see the apparently meek inherit."
2,cyberstatnerds overdo analysis,"I find this bill james inspired book pracitically useless. The stats don't even provide rbi, and the pitcher's stats don't have the won loss record. The written analysis of the players isn't bad though. I think it's time to take baseball stats away from people who worry them to death, and just rely on good old observation and experience."

2,Lots of un-needed work,"Item being reviewedMicrosoft Office Standard Edition 2003 [OLD VERSIO)?????????????I was very, very disapointed !!!! Thinking I was buying a NEW ITEM (Paying $250.00) and receiving a SEALED program it would not load onto my computer. I spent hours trying to find out why I kept getting an ""INVALID"" product key number, which was located inside the disc case.If I was the average person today I would have just given up and returned the item. Instead I kept searching and finally got some from a Microsoft Tech that tracked the product key number to a ""TEMP"" program and not a new program. He issued a new product key number and I finally was able to load the program.The program FINALLY loaded and is working -- Will I buy additional programs on line? I don't think so --- Joe Cornell"
1,Upgrade=1 star Product 4.5stars,"I really thought that office was better proir to the whole XP upgrade, but that I will leave to other discussions.This product is your standard Microsoft office products. I am fairly sure that most have experienced their products. There are no surprises and the added bells and whistles aren't worth the upgrade unless your are a VBA programmer.Now, having gone through all of this, I DO NOT rcommend that you purchase this product, but purchase the Student version. Same product - HUGELY different price."
3,Product in great condition but not what was advertised,"I have bought the standard edition but received the basic edition. Hence, I had to return it even though the product was in excellent condition. I have contacted the seller and requested a refund and for them to change the product listing so as not to misslead other buyers and they did."
1,Non-responsive vendor,I cannot review the product as it wouldn't load into the computer. The seller did not reply when contacted about the difficulty.
1,Can you Give 0 stars?,"As a devoted fan of the period piece, I am a sucker for anything filmed in costume. But unless you are a very great fan of Chopin and willing to overlook some VERY bad acting, I would save your money! I honestly threw it away after watching it one time. The characters are completely wooden, the dialog incredibly boring, and the sets, well they look like sets. I have very few requirements when it comes to period movies, but I neither got a feel for the time, got lost in the movie, nor was I able to connect to the characters(probably because the acting was so poor). This is an interesting story, with lots of movie worthy drama and intrigue. However it will be left to someone else to produce a better version."
3,Please re-release in Polish with English subtitles,"The bad English dub on this release almost ruins this film. A previous reviewer believes the acting to be poor. It's not the acting: it's the terrible, low quality dub. I really hope this film will be released one day with the original Polish soundtrack (and English subtitles). Even so, it is definitely worth watching for the music and cinematography. It's even more fun to watch after ""Children of the Century"" which also features the character George Sand."
5,EVEN FOR THE MUSIC ALONE: IT'S WORTH IT!!!; WONDERFUL MOVIE!!!,"The music of Polish Composer Chopin makes this DVD worth it. The story is excellent and truly captures Chopin (I've read many books on Chopin).Cinematogrophy, scenery costuming are so real! With all its great points, again, the music, all by itself, is worth it - so beautiful; so Chopin!!!It will take you away; A must for Chopin fans, lovers of beautiful music and, of course, all piano enthusiasts and teachers. Bravo!"
2,"If you like Chopin, buy a CD...","The movie is poorly done, and hard to follow. The plot makes very little sense.The music itself is pretty good. However, if you just like the music, then buy a CD."
2,Disappointment!,"The movie concentrated on the acerbic, immature and utterly repulsive relationship between Chopin, George Sand, her son and her daughter. It would have made more sense to delve a bit into Chopin, his motivations, and the draw between Chopin and his muse. Snippets of his music were the only saving grace in the film. I came away without sympathy for any of the characters in the movie, unable to identify with any of them, and disgusted with the lot of them, from Chopin's hatred of chicken thighs to Sands being oblivious to the impact of her affair on her family, to Selange's throwing herself at Chopin and to Maurice's immaturity and hatred of Chopin. Talk about a dysfunctional family! And how did Chopin put together his magnificent music and maintain his irrepressible talent throughout all of this? A very disappointing movie."
3,Chopin as George Sand saw him,"If you've read George Sand's novel Lucrezia Florizani everything about this movie makes perfect sense including its unusually melodramatic style. Chances are though you haven't unless your a Chopin/Romantic history buff. It is my understanding that Lucrezia Florizani , though it never mentions Chopin directly is George Sand's scandulous appraisal of their relationship after their breakup. Seeing, that the story is told through her eyes, and that she was such a writer of taudry novels, makes this movie kind of stylistically facinating. The melodramatic style is taken to a squirmingly edgy extreme. I can see what thedirector was trying to do. If you are a fan of the Romantic period in history you would probably like this film on one level at the same time it might push on and possibly even disgust your modern sensibilities."
1,"Language: English, Polish, nope","This review is not about the movie, but about the DVD.On the product page it clearly indicates ""Language: English, Polish"".In my case it can only be played in that ridculously dubbed English and subtitle only in Spanish, not even English!Purchased & shipped from Amazon.com, LLC"
4,great!,"Great! I got it very fast and well wrapped! The kids enyoyed it very much, we've already seen it twice and want to see it again...."
2,Chopin,Disappointed in the whole movie. The storyline felt very fragmented to me. Not a favorite of mine.
4,Good for snuggling on the sofa,"If it fascinates you to learn more of the life of those whose music has surrounded generations of listeners, there are movies that satisfy this need. The original movie on Tchaikovsky (there are 2, the best is Russian w/English subtitles), this movie, and, of course, Amadeus (Mozart) are the finest of the genre that I've discovered. Enjoy a beautiful movie and beautiful music and hopefully, a beautiful evening."
2,Disappointing,"I wasn't able to play this DVD on my player - finally watched it on another and found it disappointing. The music is exquisite, of course, but I have several CDs of Chopin music to listen to without the talking. And there are visually beautiful scenes. But in all, it came across as a cheesy soap opera in an aesthetic setting. There was almost no attention on Chopin's creative process, thoughts about music, etc. It was all about the craziness of Sand and her children in relation to him. One thing I found distracting and annoying is that when we first meet Sand's children, there is a little girl and a son who appears to be in his 20s but behaves and is treated like a 12 year old. Then the story jumps to ""years later"" and the daughter (different actress) is a young woman and the son (same actor) looks and acts the same as before. It adds to the obsurdity of the story. A lot of artistic talent went into the making of this movie - it just wasn't put together all that well."
3,Disappointing,"The photography is excellent. The acting is excellent. But I was disappointed in the story line. It didn't come close to reality. Perhaps it wasn't supposed to. Maybe it was intended to be just a turbulent love story using the characters of Chopin and Sand as hooks. Chopin's life was more involved and tragic than this film presented and had the story line followed his life more accurately, it would have been a much better production. Also I expected to hear more of his music but appart from the Op.10 #12 etude (played by Listz) and part of the 'Heroic' polonaise played by Chopin, there were just snippets of other works. Most of the 'mood' background music was from the same nocturne. This was very disappointing.I thought the film would find a place in my 'masterpiece' achive but it didn't. It was quite entertaining but not worth viewing more than once.A pity, it could have been much more."
1,Save your money,"Attempted to upgrade from 97 to 2003... bad move... none of my access 97 programs work now... in fact I, I brought home a 2003 access database from work to see if it was an incampatibility problem between the two versions... nope... the upgrade just didn't work.....had to purchase a full version to set things right... save your money on this product..."
3,Re : Internet Activation Policy,"To the previous reviewer regarding Internet Activation Policy.I can tell you that I recently purchased Office 2003 Pro, and I was allowed to activate the product twice. It is stated in the licensing policy that the product may be installed once on a permanent computer, and once more on a portable computer (ie: notebook, tablet etc.). This is exactly what I did. If the second computer was not portable, I don't think they would know this, and therefore you could actually install twice.Hope this helps."
5,Worked,Worked as advertised quick delivery. I used it to upgrade from 2000 because it had an additional backup feature that we needed.
5,the best series on contemporary art ever!,"I am a faithful follower of this series, and use the dvds in my contemporary art history class. The companion books make wonderful text to supplement the television series."
4,get the DVD too,This book was required for my Contemporary Art class. Great pictures....the accompaning DVD goes into more depth about each artist and provides more info about each artist than does the book.
3,Not as pretty as picture,"The pencils looked so cute on amazon, but it real life, their not as pretty. In the picture, the body of the pencils looked slightly translucent, but in real life, they're fully white. The patterns are also darker than they appeared in the picture. I also kinda wish the top was shaped more traditionally so I could put my on erasers on top."
3,Robert Mathis jersey,"The sizing was perfect. The ""painted"" numbers ran a bit is some sections but hardly noticeable. My husband wears it with pride. GO COLTS!"
4,Tasty,Perfect bachelor food - quick and easy. Really tasty compared to top ramen noodles. You can tell the seasoning is extremely sodium laden.
2,NOT WORTH IT,THIS ITEM IS TOO SMALL. I KEPT PUTTING IT ON THE BACK WINDSHIELD BUT IT KEPT FALLING DOWN EACH TIME. I COULD NOT SEE MY BABY IN THIS TINY MIRROR. NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL.
5,Great,"I decided to buy a DeWalt tool because that's always the brand I see professionals using on construction sites. Turned out to be a good choice. It's powerful, sturdy, and gets the job done."
4,Great study of the late witch hunts,"Although not the definitive guide on witchcraft, this book does do justice to the late Middle Ages and beyond, and describes the evolution and eventual downfall of witchcraft persecution. If you truly want to know about the history of witchcraft throughout the Middle Ages, you should combine this book with other books that cover the earlier history in more detail, such as R.I. Moore's ""Formation of A Persecuting Society"", which covers 950-1250; or Kors & Peters' ""Witchcraft In Europe:1100-1700."" I read alll three in college for a witchcraft class, and I would find none of them to be definitive on the subject. Taken together, however, they provided a strong overview on the topic."
3,Textbook,"This book concerns the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. This book is likely a supplemental textbook to a history or women's studies class. It is dry, but does offer a general overview of the witch hunts."
4,FANTASTIC,"COJONUDO. It's Great.All instrumental, great guitar player in wich Magic Sam give all what he got, well-known is a album little, in which it shows his tremendous quality on guitar,it has a rate that hooks and animates to dance.Viva Magic Sam, Viva el Blues"
2,The Griffin,"""The Griffin"" was an amazingly good series from DC. I would buy this collected edition like a shot ... except that this is a black-and-white reprint of a comic that was in full, gorgeous color. (And, yes, the color was gorgeous.) On that score alone, I can't recommend this."
2,WHAT?!?,I loved this series when it came out BUT it is supposed to be in color. Why reprint this in B/W? It is such a great story but loses much in this transition.
3,not just a dvd,this is actualy house on haunted hill dvd with a cd of halloween music. not done by the original groups .1.the x-files tv theme. 2.blackmagic woman.3.superstition 4.bad moon a rising 5 witchy woman 6.i put a spell on you. 7.devil in disguise 8.witch doctor 9.love song for a vampire 10.the twilight zone tv theme the rendition of witchy woman sounds close to the eagals version.full screen movie
3,"""Where Are You Going, Where Have You Been?""","I'm actually reading the story ""Where are you going, where have you been?"" in my English 11 class. I'm looking for some help on interpreting it... I really don't understand it at all! I'm wondering if it is a dream sequence, or if it really ""happened""... It reminds me of ""The Yellow Wallpaper"". I have no idea why... But it does. Anyone up to helping me get his story? My e-mail is ..."
2,I've Heard This One Before,"The writing was good, but I liked the story better the first time I heard it, when it was called Degrassi Junior High. It was more of an after-school special than a meaningful short story. Anybody who tries to find significance in this story should delve into the symbolism of The Cat in the Hat."
3,It was decent,I had to read this story along with other short stories for a college course. I didn't really get into at first but after class discussions and rereading it I sorta got the point. I was never really fond of short stories and doubt I ever will be.
3,Poli Sci Book Review,"If I didn't need this book for my Poli Sci class, I wouldn't have bought it. There were parts that were a bit repetitive but that's to be expected from any academic source. There were parts that were helpful so this book wasn't a complete waste of money. So for my overall opinion of it: complete indifference. I neither liked nor disliked this book."
4,Unexpected - really deserves 4 1/2 stars,"First of all, I must say that I loved Ben Stiller in this rather different role. I am accustomed to him playing a more comedic part, and he was surprisingly good in this serious role. Bill Pullman played his somewhat bi-polar character with an unexpected style as well. This film was really amazingly good from beginning to end and kept my interest throughout. The plot was intricate and complex. I would prefer to give it 4 1/2 stars. Not quite 5, but very close"
4,You can't be following someone if you're there first...,"This movie has good acting, a nice story, and is just plain fun. Anyone who likes Ben Stiller or Bill Pullman should see this movie..."
4,"Intriguing, if familiar, mystery","Pullman and Stiller are excellent in this modern day remake of the Sherlock Holmes story ""A Scandal in Bohemia"". Plot twists keep you guessing, and Kasdan doesn't let us down with contrivances or cliches. Offbeat and and occasionally strange, highly entertaining and well worth seeing; with Pullman putting in an astonishingly good performance as a present day American Holmes."
5,Anything but a zero,a wonderfully enjoyable movie. Bill Pullman and Ben Stiller are great. The scene in the hotel room where Arlo tells zero that there aren't good guys and bad guys is one of the most subtely humurous ever. Great soundtrack backs this great movie.
2,Zero Effect,"The name says it all doesn't it. It had Zero Effect on me and my two buddies who watched it with me. I hope Ben stiller and Bill Pullman gave what they earned to charity. At least that way their time would have been waisted for a good cause. If only I had given the five euro rental charge to charity instead of the rental shop. I would have save myself a major BARF session. I'm giving this one five thumbs up, my lowest rating yet! The time I put into Zero Effect could have been spent talking to this babe I like."
4,Clever Sherlock Holmes adaptation,"If you have ever read about Sherlock Holmes you will recognize him in Darel Zero. Extremely observant and intelligent man who is lacking social graces and therefore requires a front man, played here by Ben Stiller. There is also a subplot about a brilliant lady that matches wits with the hero and wins his admiration. There are more similarities to Holmes, but this film is not lesser for them. It is a funny, clever, and suspensful film about one's true nature. I really enjoyed this movie and definitely recommend it."
4,Maybe the best movie of 1998...,"This is an extremely entertaining little film - with Bill Pullman providing most of the laughs - alongside the usually comic Ben Stiller - who is somewhat serious in this role. The film is about an extremely talented private dick who is inexperienced in his own personal life - which takes an almost classic twist (reminiscent of some old hollywood films) when he falls for the charms of someone - who turns out to be equally adept at hiding things. This is a very unique, intelligent movie that will leave you satisfied and a little bit excited about what you have seen. I think this gives us a glimpse of what hollywood these days is capable of, but rarely delivers - a charming character study!"
5,sony cordless phone,"I have had a sony cordless phone( spp-a967 900 mhz dss cordless phone) for approximately 10 years. The phone has with stood all elements of time. The only problem I have with it now is that the lcd indicator is out on the handset. I contacted the sony company and they have quit making them. I cannot find the part to repair it, but I will use it until it goes completely dead. The best phone on the market and now it is out of circulation."
5,Simply phenomenal. One of the best performance DVD's around.,"If you want to see four of the absolute best players working today playing an inspired set than this is for you. Start to finish it's a non-stop display of technique (not for technique's sake however), musicality, and mastery. Awe-inspiring. Peter Erskine's performance is so good it's comedic. Great sound, great camera angles, great editing. Top-notch. The clinic-type setting is cool because you get to hear these guys talk about their approach to music but it's kind of painful and embarrasing to listen to some of the people in the audience ask questions with obvious answers. If you are a working musician and you haven't seen this, check it out and prepare to consider giving up."
5,4 month's later!,"This ring is still as beautiful as the day received, my fiancée loves it. The setting looks very sturdy and the diamond is very clear and has a great cut. I told everyone I went to Jarrods and they believed it. The case was very nice as well"
4,Better than I expected,"Bought this as a replacement engagement ring for my grandmother who lost hers years back. She loves it and the diamond was a nicer quality than I had thought it would be, it glitters perfectly in the light and the band is simple and petite just the way she wanted. Definitely recommend for people looking for a cheap pretty ring."
1,Upset,I loved my ring when my hubby gave it to me earlier this year. Its BEAUTIFUL. then all of the sudden (after having my ring not even a whole year) I look down and my diamond had fallen out!! Very upsetting and I couldn't find it anywhere!! When I called amazon to try and get help they said since we didn't get any warranty on it that they could't do anything for me. So now I have a ring with no diamond. I am very unhappy with amazon for not helping me! They shouldn't sell jewelry that falls apart after only a year. Wish they could have helped me more.
5,"killer of women, but with pizzazz!","I put this lovely engagement ring in a dessert being served at a 5-star restaurant as a means of proposal. I forgot that my now-dead fiance is legally blind. Before she could notice the ring on her plate she swallowed a bite of her cone-head sundae, and the ring with it. The diamond shredded her esophagal lining and she died hours later. But man, what a way to go! In style! Great product, will ask 5 other women to marry me with this ring but in safer circumstances."
3,To small for someone who is tall,"I purchase 2 choppers one for my son and one for my daughter. My daughter fits on hers just fine. But, my son who is a couple of years older has a hard time riding them because of his height. Overall a good product. Just to small."
4,Razor Harley Bike,My son really enjoys this bike and it stays charged for a long period of time. It will go up to 15 miles per hour--COOL ITEMThanksD.Qualls
5,zippy little chopper,"I bought this bike for my 7 year old son for xmas. he absolutely loves it. although he still was driving a battery operated four-wheeler (you know, the power wheels kind of thing), he had really outgrown it. the razor chopper has quite a bit more speed. he can ride it around our long driveway and through the yard with no problems. it will handle up to 200 lbs, so i bet we have a long time to enjoy. the chopper has a very wide turning radius, a challenge in our driveway and doesn't make our skateboard ramp very well. but, other than that, the bike has been a great selection for the price!"
4,Great Price for fun Toy,"We got this Razor Mini Chopper at Christmas time and the price was better than anywhere else we could find. My 2 sons had a great time using this chopper, however it did go a little fast for their age group (6-8). Make sure you purchase a helmet to go with it."
1,Mini Chopper Bike,"This item was not what it was advertised to be. It was rated for 12 years and up. My 11 year old was so uncomfortable trying to ride this that it was unreal. His knees were up to his chin. This item should be rated for 6 years and under, in my opinion."
1,Withered,"I ordered these flowers for my mom and she told me they were withered. So, I called the business and they told me that it's suppose to be like that. They said that the recipient is suppose to water the flower and give it food and bring it back to life. I don't know if this is normal across the board, but I don't like it one bit because I paid $55 for withered flowers. So, go ahead if you want to send your loved ones withered flowers."
4,Roc,"Misunderstood what this was. I was after Power Point and thought this had it too but it did not. Not the fault of the shipper, but I have no use for Excel alone. I already opened it so I couldn't send it back."
5,The bible of AR15 competition,"I knew very little on the subject. I read this book and opened up with an ""Expert"" rating across the course after the first several matches. This book will ramp you through the learning curve of highpower competition with the AR15 like no other. God bless Glen and his gifted skills of communication in print."
3,AR-15 book,"This book was so basic and dated that it proved to not have very useful information. If someone is trying to decide WHAT type of AR to get this book might be helpful not as good as his 1911 book. Not much useful information in the book as it just barely covers a great amount of material but just barely dips into each category. My expectation of a ""Owners Guide"" were tips and suggestions of what to get and how to take care of it once you owned it..... no such tips!"
2,"Too focused on competetion, and not the gun itself","If you are intersted in competing in an NRA match, this book will be very helpful. However, if you are interested in an intro to the AR-15, and basics on how to use it/clean it/shoot it, this book isn't for you. I ended up skimming the first half of the book, as it didn't read very well, and had many tangential points. I have been shooting for years, and wanted a good book for a non-match shooting enthusiast. This book was a disappointment."
3,Made quite cheap...,"...still my grandson liked to listen to it a few times. then again,he's 'NUTS' about Thomas and Friends!would love to see it made of better quality paper etc...."
3,An OK book,"I wouldn't say this is the greatest book to learn ABC from. However, my 2 year old, a Thomas fan, loves this book. Big colorful pictures."
4,Pretty good.,"It's a simple book. Not Barnes & Noble quality book, but my daughter loves it and it's practice with the alphabet."
4,"My son loves the book, but I was a little disappointed",My son loves anything Thomas and he loves this book. I thought it seemed a little cheap though. It looks like something I could have printed out on my color printer. My son doesn't mind one bit though and asks to read it all the time.
4,great!!,My grandson is in love with anything that has to do with Thomas so he is really enjoying this product. I am too.
4,2 yr old loves it .......,My 2 yr old loves this book. I thought the characters were gonna be the new looking characters but it doesn't matter he loves this book.
5,Very good book,My 2 year old grandson really enjoyed this book and loves to read it over and over. He takes it with us everywhere.
5,great book,what a great little ABC book at a great price too! my son loves following the train tracks from page to page and saying his abc
1,Dreadful for Early Learners,"This book is horrendous. It starts out strong, or at least normally, matching pictures with actual sounds, but after about ""F"" it goes completely wrong. The book uses pictures that in no way match the letter or the word that they provide with the letter. For example: ""T"" is for tracks. That would be fine, except that on the tracks sits Edward and it confused our boy horribly. Why not put Thomas on the tracks instead? ""W"" is for ""Whee!"" Why not use Whiff? (Yes, he knows all the trains by heart, and therefore so do we.) ""X"" is the worst. ""X"" is for ""eXpress,"" REALLY? Don't waste your money. Even if your child is a die-hard Thomas fan like ours, there are numerous books that actually teach children appropriate letter associations."
3,An ok book for the money,"I ordered this book as a cheap stocking stuffer, and to it was fine for that purpose. It is a pretty flimsy paperback, though, so if you are looking for something with more quality, I would go for something with a higher price tag."
2,"What , no VIEWER???","I would have to say this product is pretty amazing. However, to use it to it's full capability would require you to have a robust Active Directory, Windows 2003, Sharepoint Portal Server, Exchange 2003, SQL Server 2000 and a ton of trained end users.The biggest downfall is that there is no viewer availiable so any forms that you create using Infopath will require the client PC to have a copy/liscensed version... You do the math. =)"
5,Another DeWalt Success,"I needed a little more speed without giving up any power. I got both, and all packaged in another fine power tool from DeWalt.This variable speed reversible drill has a simple, but efficient design. The craftsmanship of assembly is very good. The ratcheting chuck is not only handy, but solid as well (from 3/8 all the way down to a 1/16 bit). The trigger action is smooth and speed is proportional to the movement. Reversal switch is convenient and I like the fact they have removed the trigger lock (safer).I am very pleased with this drill and would recommend it to a hobbyist or a professional."
3,Still Looking,"I agree with the reviews describing the tool as powerful and great feel to it. I will be exchanging my second one very soon. The first one's chuck would not stay tight and would slip on the bit. The second one has a defective switch. It will not stop running when you release the trigger in forward direction. In reverse, it will stop. The trigger hangs on the forward-reverse lever. A drop of oil did not help. This is a potentially dangerous situation when the drill does not stop until you manually pull the switch out or unplug it. However, I will try one more time to get a good one. I like the tool design."
2,Good Drill Lousy Supplier,I ordered this drill in December and the drill was shipped in May. Shipment was delayed twice. Meanwhile same item was listed on this page as being in stock.
1,made in mexico,I bought this drill because the ad said it was made in USA.. It is made in Mexico. I do not appreciate false advertising. I WOULD NOT HAVE PURCHASED THIS ITEM IF THEY TOLD ME WHERE IT WAS REALLY MADE!! This is my last purchase from Amazon
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good value. Not the most powerful but definitely got the job done. Actually, it may have been my drill bit. I'm happy with the purchase."
5,Great Drill,This a great drill. Great for those jobs that your cordless drill can't cover. Great price.
4,Pretty good drill,"First off, this drill is now made in Mexico. I'm suspect of how this will affect the durability and reliability of the drill, so whatever positive things I have to say about this drill has that caveatNext, this drill is extremely comfortable in hand, especially for those with medium to small hands. The weight and balance is exceptional as compared to the Milwaukee Magnum drill that I compared it to. That drill was really heavy and the bulk of the weight was balanced towards the front of the drill - not comfortable. The Dewalt drill is powerful enough to handle most chores but I wouldn't use it to drill cement.It's also highly noisy (as compared to Makita drills) so be prepared to be numb in the ears or get earplugs. Overall, for the cheap price, I'd say it's a very useable, solid drill. If it were made in the USA and were quieter, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Fine to Drill but cannot use to drive screws,The drill powers up immediately to full speed and is not useable for driving screws. Not a variable speed device even though it claims to be a 'VSR' drill. OK for drilling holes.
3,DeWalt drill,"Powerful drill with easy to use, good-gripping chuck. Bubble level in handle helps to drill vertical or horizontal holes. Speed control is easy to use. The one I got is a bit wobbly, the chuck center isn't quite in-line with the motor or shaft center; so when I use a long bit, the whole unit wobbles quite a lot. I've broken a few bits because of this."
4,Nice and affordable. All that most people will ever need.,"This is a nice affordable drill. Lightweight and powerful. No, it is not a 1/2"" Milwaukee Magnum, but those are heavy and expensive. Mine came with the all-metal chuck featured on the D21009, so they must have ditched the plastic chuck. The only thing I would like is an adjustable torque to make it a driver as well. This thing will blow through a lot of stuff with a screw-driver bit--and I hate cordless tools (actually I hate the need to continue buying new batteries)."
5,The DeWalt D21008K is great for drilling and screwing,"I almost did not buy this because of the negative comments about not being able to use this for screwing. To the contrary, by using two fingers on the trigger it is very easy to control the speed for work with screws or for slow drilling. I have used it on several projects for screwing or removing screws. I love this product."
3,"O K, but......","Chuck is less than secure, trigger makes it difficult to control speed when driving screws, my Dewalt cordless drills worked better, but they died of old age, so I use this, for now. Would not buy it again. looking at Milwaukee this time."
3,Andre Antoine is a Megolomaniac,Do you love theatre? Are you a Francophile? Does Zola make you salivate? What about pretentious journaling?Then you will love this piece. An excellent means of exploring Antoine's significant Theatre Libre and its place in paving Naturalist theatrical activity.
5,Why Toscanini was so Great,"This is an excellent set of Toscanini performances with the BBC, from an exciting Anacreon overture and a great Missa Solemnis to a nice performance of Mozart's Haffner Symphony No. 35 and one of the greatest recordings ever of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7. As the previous review noted the sound quality is much better than the NYPO recording and is quite amazing for a mid-1935 recording. In regards to Symphony No. 7, I find the tempi better on this performance to be better than the NYPO performance a year later, and it to be a thrilling performance throughout."
4,Lifting weights,"Great quality at an decent price. I did alot of research and shopping before I pulled the trigger. Shopped Sears, Harbor Freight, H. Depot, Costco and Sam's. Also visited many tool type web sites. This Aluminum jack was the best bang for the buck. Lifts heavy vehicles such as Trucks or SUV's with minimal effort. Glad I bought it."
1,NOT so much of a racing jack!,"First off, it's heavy. Second, it takes approx. 26 pumps to fully extend. Third, the handle pulled apart with minimal effort. You couldn't even pull the jack with it. And fourth, when I unboxed it, I worked the jack up and down to test operation, (which was good, but slow), let it sit in my shop for a day before actually using it, and the thing puked fluid all over my floor. I spent a few exta dollars on an Arcan unit, and love it."
4,Amazing jack.,"3 ton load capacity, REALLY heavy duty, quite light thanks to the aluminum. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that the handle can be a pain. It's a 2-piece lever, and the part where it separates is held by a button thingy which gives out wayyyyyy too frequently when twisting to tighten or loosen. Still, I love this jack. It's like the ninja of jacks....or the samurai. Yes. Probably more like a Samurai jack... ;D"
4,Great Fun,"I was really happy to find that other people are obviously as obsessed over this song as I have been. If you love Wire and love the song...you must get this album. There are some standouts, but the whole collection is solid imo. It was cool to see that the record company(Words on Music)is in my neighborhood. Great Fun!"
1,Boring and not worth the price.,"I was very disappointed. These National Geographic specials are usually quality productions. But this one seems more of an afterthought than a serious effort. The actors walk around in cheap high school costumes that make no effort at all to be historical. And the expert commentary seems very tongue-in-cheek. Nothing in this special is at all special. I really expected better.Check out Michael Wood's ""In Search of the Trojan War"" instead. It has more of what you expected to be in this DVD."
1,I wanted my hour back,"This was very disapointing. The re-enactments were horrible. Watch In Search of the Trojan War instead its long but it provides a lot more information or better yet read ""The Ancient Greece of Odysseus"" by Peter Connolly."
3,Cheap,"Sometimes you get what you pay for, as in this case. Parts of it broke easily with assembly and it is not very sturdy. It worked ok for the kids going up and down, but it was very very wobbly when the adults used it. I had to use weights to keep it in place."
2,Extremely basic ideas that are not well explained.,While this book gives an excellent idea of how to put the Java building blocks of a good game together it does not explain the fundamentals and ideas the back them. It assumes some basic java knowledge and applies it to extremely simple games. It's good for those who know Java but are new at programming games.
3,"Warning, don't buy this book without the included cd!","If you don't have the included cd (you bought it used like I did) you will have a very difficult time following along. When I typed in the example code in chapter 1 I had to do very little to get the code to run on a modern version of java. However in chapter 2 I discovered that there is way too much code missing to in order to get the program to work. While I find that the book will still be somewhat usefull without the cd, I won't be able to get as much out of it as I wanted."
4,Dated Material,Note that all the example code uses the 'old' 1.0 event model. It would be nice to see a second edition that uses Swing and the new event model.
4,I like Palladio,"I like Palladio mascara but unfortunately I got the wrong one. This is thickening and I meant to get lengthening. I don't think I will be able to use this one because it doesn't lengthen and I have tiny, you can barely see eyelashes."
3,Very basic but effective work out,"I was not impressed too much as I watched the video for a few minutes. Didn't seem to be too much of a workout but let me tell you, once I got up off the couch and started following the easy to understand steps I realized that this was WORK! I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble following dance moves in work out videos. It's very easy to understand and mimic and you will feel this one the next day!"
5,Dance samba in no time!!,"Quenia Ribeiro will have you dancing samba in no time. In addition to teaching you the steps she tells you what to listen for in the music so you can time your steps correctly. She has a bit in the begining where she introduces her band and has them play each instrument seperately as she tells you which instrument you should listen for and follow. I also purchased the samba reggae workout which is just as good and more of a workout tape than this dvd. The samba reggae workout teaches samba reggae instead of ""no pe"" which is the kind taught on this dvd and danced in carnival. I definitely recommed both since the instruction is excellent and easy to follow."
5,Worthwhile,I really like this dvd. She does a good job of showing the steps slow then up to speed and gradually adding on until you have the whole dance. It is a lot of fun and seems to be very authentic samba (but I'm no expert!)
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"If you are looking for some lessions about most famour samba steps, this DVD is exactly what you need.Really simple, easy to repeat.Simply Great!thank you!"
2,Not enough to learn Samba,"Actually I am little bit dissapointed after I watch whole DVD, just because the dancer is not able to teach Samba. It is hard to follow her steps while she's dancing because she does not say ""begin with rigth and then left ..."" etc. Also I watch some videos on Youtube and get some tricks about Samba, but in her video there is no trick:(because of this my review is not good, sorry."
3,Looks good but hard to follow,"I am giving this DVD a relatively low rating because the instructor is always facing you, thus making it difficult to follow the choreography, as you are left to figure out what side you should move to and what foot to start with. It's mostly ok when the simple steps are demonstrated in isolation, but extremely confusing when trying to follow the choreography. I found myself spending too much time concentrating on trying to follow her routine but in the opposite direction so to say, i.e. when her cues tell to step left she actually steps to my right etc. As a beginner with no background in dance, I wish the instructor would turn around with her back to the student at least sometimes so that I could just copy exactly what she is doing."
1,Battle Tactics,Tactics not really explored. The title is a real teaser because you believe you might learn something by reading it. If you have played a shooter video game you will learn more about tactics than from this book. Waste of time and money.
2,Please do not waste your money.,This book belongs in a library for people who want to know how a swat team works. Not worth reading
2,Not a good value,"I bought this book about a year ago and I read through it. I initially liked the beginning as it talked about weapons. As I read on I was disappointed that this was more of an overview of operations. At the end there was PT stuff which doesn't really belong in a book for people looking to learn about SWAT tactics.There is nothing about room entry/clearance, objects, stairs etc. This book would be useful to someone in management but not for a SWAT/Tactical practitioner."
1,Misleading title,"Don't be mislead by the cover of this book. It is very basic and only gives you an overview of Swat Team Operations. No real in-depth coverage of the actual training and procedures. Also the book is over 10 years old, and has no good info on active shooter training."
1,Too Basic and simple,"I bought this book hoping to learn the tactics used by SWAT units. I was incredibly disappointed. The author begins by trying to explain rifle platoon tactics, but he does a very poor job. Anything the author does explain, anyone who would purchase this book already knows."
1,very basic,This is a very basic book for someone who knows nothing about SWAT teams. If you have have been an operator for more than a week this book will not help you.
3,Not a bad book,"This book not being a very complete book, far from it, its a book that has some qualities like some signals you can use to comunicate with your allies and how to make scetches of buildings. Its not a bad book"
3,"beautiful illustrations, quirky story","as a children's librarian i am often given kid's books as gifts as was the case with this one. i probably would not have purchased this book for myself, but it is cute. the illustrations are easily the best part. they are adorable, soft and fresh and make you want to put tinka in your pocket. the story is a bit odd and occasionally jumps awkwardly. it's a little long for group sharing but would work one-on-one. most people will probably be attracted to it by its cover and will forgive the somewhat trite, predictable storyline. overall, it's an okay book."
1,switched to another brand,"I had 3 of these quit working within a couple months of purchase, tired of asking for replacements, Ive switched to another brand !!"
4,Digital feeder,"Our hunting club has approximately 40 feeders in the field. This is among the most dependable of the various types used, and can be programmed to throw a multitude of times, days, amounts. Unfortunately the pillars joining the funnel to the base unit are plastic (as is the rest of the unit) and can be easily broken. It would also be nice to have the unit show remaining battery life."
4,Ok feeder kit,"Nice feeder kit, but programing could be made easier. This is a easy feeder kit to mount, takes very little skill in mounting to your hopper or old feeder. Only draw back is programing, takes a little too long."
2,stick with excel 2003,"I love excel and have run excel 2003 for years - but I sure don't like excel 2007 - the menus are busy, over-developed and non intuitive - and you can't modify them back to the ""classic"" look and feel - what a step backward - I'm throwing away the money I put into buying 2007 and getting 2003 back - it's a super program, but 2007 is a real step backwards interface and useability wise. Buy 2003 if you have the chance - it might be forced out sometime - then I go to a mac running XP and I'll stay non upgraded."
3,When Will They Lower The Price?,"Essentially, we were forced to purchase this upgrade to fix some problems with complex, macro-laden spreadsheets. It worked, but IMHO the price of this three-year-old software is too high. Every other similar product's price gets lower over time, but not Microsoft's products. I don't know why some other company doesn't copy their original formula, namely, creating similar software at a lower price that reads (and co-opts) the competiton's datafiles."
3,tablets ok,"tablets are not a stabilizing tablet, (my fault) they also leave residue in the bottom of the pool, they don't dissolve completely which means having to vacuum about every 2 or 3 days."
5,Works Like a Charm,"This product, if applied before alge build up, works great. Even if you are a little late in applying, it greatly reduces alge growth. I use this product in our waterfall and stream and highly recommend it."
2,Not that great for a spa,I used this product for a couple of days in our spa which is a smaller size 350 gallons and it was to strong and made my skin tingle. Went back to using the grandules that you add after using spa and just fine. Returned product after only using 2 tablets. Each tablet lasted about 3 days in the dispenser.
5,Goodbye algae,"These tablets work great.My pool is small since it is 8'by30'' so I break these 1inch tablets in half.Have never had to worry about that ""skin"" of nasty algae or anything past that.Very few sellers sell this at a reasonable price (some over 100$!), but amazonsells it at a great price if you are willing to be patient.This amount will easily last me multiple summers.If you have a small pool, I recommend these.Some of the tablets were broken on arrival, but since I only need small amountsat a time, that wasn't a problem for me, but might be for some people withlarger inflatable/permanent pools than myself."
5,Works well,"I use these for both my pool (10,000 gallons / ozone and chlorine sanitation), and my spa (250 gallons, chlorine sanitation). I add 1 to 2 tabs each week to my spa, and I fill up my pool's chlorinator with these tabs every couple of weeks. This product works well in both cases."
3,Basic Introduction to Mold Collecting,"A classic, only because not much else is available on the subject. Some helpful pictures. Not a Scholar's work. Leaves more questions than it answers. Long out of print. Look for a used copy, because this thin little paper back is NOT worth a premium price."
3,Numerous errors but not completely lacking in merit,"This book is packed with a lot of information and many illustrations and photographs, and a lot of it is good information. Unfortunately there are also many errors, mislabeled captions and even incomplete captions where they ran out of space on the page! Other than careful observation, one way I discovered this is that many of the same photos and illustrations appear with proper captions in ""The Fighting Men of The Civil War"" by William C. Davis (ISBN-13: 978-0806130606), a superior albeit coffee-table-sized book. Anyway, as fay as this David Miller (ed.) book is concerned, I would not make it a center piece of my civil war book collection. Having said that, its small size can make a handy read (if you take it with a grain of salt), and there are some good color uniform illustrations."
3,You need if you manage projects,"MS Project has become the de facto standard at many organization. If you already use an earlier version or if Project is the tool of choice at a company, you need this version. Some improvements over the previous version. Better integration with the rest of Office. It is still not a product you use effective right out of the box. You especially have know about the changes MS has made."
1,Poor choice,"I purchased about a year ago and saved $20. It doesnt work,couldnt get it repaired for less than $40, so I gave it to a friend as a paperweight and am in the process of buying another Brand with a decent warrantee like I should have done to begin with. Any Questions?"
3,"Does all right, but -","I've had this drill for 2 1/2 years, and I use it extensively. After about 10 months, the switch broke, but still under warranty, and was fixed in a couple weeks. Now the chuck is getting hard to loosen and tighten.There's a drill bit size - roughly 1/8"" - that gets stuck in the chuck, and it takes about 30 seconds of giggling with it to get it out.The chuck also loosens up while you're using it. I've dropped many bits on the floor - and other places.On the plus side; the drill is fast, light, and strong. I've used it to drive 3"" screws over and over again. I've used it with a 4"" hole saw (not that I'd recommend doing that). It performs - despite it's flaws."
3,"Fly Little Bird, Fly!",Left me hanging. I need to know what happened to the main character and his brother. Was there another book by the same author that carried the story to its conclusion?
4,Warrior Elite,"One cannot but be floored by the level of dedication and commitment of these young men, to endure the most ""hellacious"" test of the human spirit. To be the best our Warriors have to put up with the worst. These men do it without any modern day pronouncements of political correctness, lowered standards based on race or ethnicity, or ashamedly no such notion of ""an Army of one."" These men win together, are the best and the brightest, and I thank God they are Americans."
4,A select few,"It seems to me you have to have a particular reason for picking up this book. Mine was an interest in understanding what it takes to be ""elite."" The book can be inspirational or damning in terms of what you have done with your life! It's amazing what people are willing to do if motivated...! These ""warriors"" represent the best we can attain as human beings physically, psychologically and intellectually. These are truly the best of the best of the best."
4,Gains Respect,"After you read this book, you will have a new respect for the men who endure what it takes to become a Navy Seal. The author does a great job of allowing you to experience every aspect of their training and heart ships."
4,Warrior Elite review,"In light of the subject matter, the book is a little tedious in its detail, though the detail is necessary to convey the extreme nature of the training. Seeing what these young men endure can be exhausting, but it's a very well written account of BUD/S training.I'd recommend it to others who want an intimate look at the training program of Navy SEALs."
5,His Best,This book was excellent and I know at least a few other guys that I went through similar USAF training with that used it as motivation. It is well written and you can clearly see the author's care for his subject.
4,Thrilling,"This is an excellent book not just for the military junkie, but for anyone who needs to take action in their life. What these BUD/S trainees go through every single day is more exciting than an average workout all week. The stories in the first 3/4 of the book are enthralling. The end kind of drags, but there's some excellent words of advice from the author that you can take with you to live an inspiring life. Easy read from cover to cover."
3,Much ado about everything,"The book tells you what it is like to go through BUD/s. I would like to have be given some hints on how to survive the experience. The author includes a lot of detail in a chronologic manner but somehow fails in nuance and color. Needs more smells and pain. However, for anyone interested in the teams, this will tell you how it is. Worth the money and the book was received earlier than expected and in fine shape.Operator 1030"
3,Lots of detail about the training program,"This book contains a great deal of information about the SEAL training program and how mindboggling difficult it is to accomplish. The author is obviously very interested in the actual training program; what gets lost are the people themselves. I was expecting the book to be something of a Survivor-type story, where we would meet some members of the class of 228, get to know them and their motivations and see which ones failed and which ones survived. Instead, the characters are introduced in a very perfunctory way, and almost none of the quitters are gone into in any detail."
5,Gotta Have It!,The book was in excellent condition as stated by the seller. I was pleased with how fast it was delivered and will purchase from this seller in the future!
5,Outstanding book!,"Couldn't put it down. After reading this book, you will understand just how smart, tough, and well trained our Navy SEALs are. It also gave me confidence that we will win the war against terrorism. Those terrorists can run and hide, but with fighting forces like the SEALs, we're eventually going to get them."
3,"Great story, so-so storytelling","This book gets by on the sheer compelling nature of what it takes to be a Navy SEAL. The process truly is amazing. Unfortunately, you don't get to know the people going it through it as well as you might want (somewhat understandable, since they were kind of busy at the time). I also wanted to know more about life in the teams and actual missions. I realize that's probably a different book, but I didn't want it to be. If you want great military writing, this is not your book. If you want a feeling for what a SEAL (or SpecOp in general) has gone through to get where he is, this is a must-read.I also found it truly inspiring. When I'm on a run or working out and it starts to hurt, I think of what 228 went through and things don't seem so bad. Or else I just tell myself the basic lesson I learned from the book: SEALs don't quit, so I won't either."
3,The Warrior Elite,Not a bad book but it gets a bit redundant after awhile. The characters are flat and we never really get to know them or why they do this. General description of training is about all you get out of this. Makes you want to do a few push-ups!
2,"Inspiring, but boring","Like most readers, I bought this book based on glowing reviews in print publications and on Amazon.The description of the incredibly rigorous training program that Navy Seals must endure, and how that program culls out so many otherwise outstanding candidates is interesting. Citizens and residents of the US are very fortunate to have such soldiers defending the nation, and what Seals endure to serve their country is inspiring.The writing is simple and clear. But the characters are uniformly portrayed in a two-dimensional way and so ultimately it's kind of a gung-ho but boring read.As with many non-fiction books, it could have been done as or more effectively through an in-dept magazine article."
5,The Warrior Elite: The Forging of Seal Class 228,My son is a Navy Seal and I verified with him that this book very accurately represents the life of a Seal in training. I highly recommend it!
4,Good Book,"This is a good book that could have been alot better. The author does a good job describing the 6 month SEAL training program and the daily evolutions that comprise it. What's missing, though, is any sort of character development of the trainees themselves. The physical travails that these guys endure is well told but their emotional journey is left to the readers' imagination."
1,A load of bunk!,This book is an oversized paperweight that you can do without. The book has little substance. Most of the material is fluff. I agree with a previous reviewer that said you should get the Web Publishing Electronic Resource Kit.
2,Web Publishing Electronic Resource Kit is a better deal!,"Platinum Edition Using HTML, Java and CGI is written by users for users and does NOT have what it takes to get you through the intracies of publishing a home page or Web site. Most of the chapters skim the surface with lots of superficial stuff and no real details.Sure, the book comes with lots of books on the CD. But once again, these books are designed to help you USE rather than DESIGN/PUBLISH/PROGRAM. So what you end up with is a reference library that covers lots of subjects superficially.When you look at this book and the comparably priced and MUCH MUCH BETTER Web Publishing Electronic Resource Kit (ISBN: 157521265X) packaged with a print edition of the Web Publishing Unleashed Professional Reference Edition (a 1500+ page book( and 14 books on CD, you see that Platinum Edition is NOT a good choice or a good value. The Web Publishing Electronic Resource Kit covers everything you need to know as a Web publishing, developer and programmer!"
2,Skims the surface of deep topics,"The book is more for an user than for a web developer. I wouldn't call it the Ultimate Web Developer's Resource. However, it does come with a CD-ROM with the full text of 12 other books.."
1,Get Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Prof. Ref. Instead!,"Using HTML, Java, and CGI just didn't cut it. The book is designed for users not people who publish home pages or develop Web sites. That said, I am what I consider to be a power user, who still thought the book was poorly conceived and poorly written. A much better choice is Stanek's Web Publishing Unleashed Professional Reference"
2,Not ready for prime time!,I thought the book didn't cover the major issues very well. Often I had to puzzle through what the authors were saying. Overall the book left me feeling frustrated..
5,This is the Web Developer's Bible,"Buy this book and get 12 more books on CD! No other book can rival this book's library of references. Javascript, Java, Perl and CGI programming are all covered in its actual pages. The books on the CD are accessed using any web browser. Start here to become the super web master. We fight over it in our office"
2,breaks ribbon cartridge.,"I have not used this printer very much since I have another printer.( I've had it about 6 mo.). Halfway through the pack of 100 paper the ribbon cartridge broke. You can't buy just a ribbon cartridge, you have to buy a complete package of paper and ribbon. The ribbon only prints the number of photo paper you purchase. So now I have all this extra paper and no way to use it. Of course now that this has happened the printer must have ribbon jammed in it, because it won't work. If I hadn't purchased 3 more packs of extra paper and ribbon,(costly) I'd throw this printer in the trash! Of course I can't find my reciept so Olympus wants $80.00 just to look at it."
4,Excellent Photos... but a bit expensive,"The Olympus printer truly produces photos that are indistinguishable from those you'd get in the photoprocessing stores or online photo sources.Unfortunately, the printer prints on the dark side and colors on all photos must be brightened (almost to the point of color blow out) to correct this. Also, the printer drivers didn't install correctly for me. The default appears to be Spanish rather than English. Reinstalling using the provided CD has not rectified the problem.Also, potential purchasers must seriously consider whether about $29 is a reasonable price for 100 prints, because that is what the printer packs cost. Yes, the convenience of printing at home (or during travel) is grand, but many online companies now offer volume pricing for print orders."
2,Good product with bad software,"I purchased this printer for mainly 4x6 prints & my Canon printer for larger prints. The picture quality is often different from my PC monior screen and I have to adjust the graphic setting for different pictures. In other words, I have to waste several test prints before I finally get a picture close to the monitor. Also when I print, I need to individually import/transfer picture files into the Olympus software from My Pictures folder of Window XP. It cannot just click the picture and send it to the printer. What a pain! This product is OK if you print pictures directly from a camra and your expectation of photo quality is low. Once the color condition is met, the print itself is fantastic with waterproof paper."
5,Excellent Printer,I purchased this printer because my previous P-10 broke down and a Dye-Sub Printer is a must in my photo business. This printer has done exactly what I needed and I would recommend it to any serious photo print enthusiast.
3,Thigh High,I have a few things to say about this item. No negative comments can be given because everything that the seller noted was true. These thigh highs are very dark and no skin can be seen through them. The lace up ribbons are not actual laces but more of a picture of laces criss crossing. I believe it is one size fits all but if you are a little vulumptous like me then these will make you look alot more chunkier as the portion around your thighs will look like they are getting the life squeezed outta them. But my husband absolutely loves this item so maybe all my negatives are his positives!
3,not happy,"when i open it , there was no pink on it , that was the only reason I want it ... not happy"
1,Very Bad Purchase,"The auger system on this product is poorly designed, very light weight plastic and underpowered. If your material to be spread is not perfectly uniform and dry the auger will immediately jam with no indicator. If the auger jams and cannot be cleared with the reverse you must tear the unit apart to clear the jam since the enclosed auger system is located under the hopper. Another bad design element is the hopper has a flat bottom and the inlet to the auger is located at the far edge which results in very uneven flow.I would like to thank Amazon for their great customer service in returning this product."
1,Pointless,"I borrowed this book from the library, so I, luckily, did not waste any money on it. I can't believe they managed to fill up 179 pages. The information in the book is the same kind one could find on the internet. It doesn't help with a pharmacy technician career, it just tells you about it. Why waste the money. Go to Walgreens or Target or a local hospital and talk to a real tech. It would be a better way to spend your time."
5,A Beautiful Book of Photographs,"This picture book covers diverse themes. Poetry is interspersed between the photographs, and there is a section in the book which gives brief biographies of the women photographers of this book.A section on humans includes the Tibetan man, Yi woman, Kuna woman, a winter solstice celebration, mountain monastery, and a ghost town. Most of the book, however, is centered on nature. There are photos of Monument Valley, Arizona, autumn reflection in a waterfall, minerals such as sandstone, etc. Plants photographed include the fleabane, sunflower, white spruce cones, and the flowering crab apple. Animal photographs include the African elephant, impala, bald eagle, python, elephant seal, and the lion. There's even a photo of a spider web with a captured fly."
2,Mozart's Sister,The DVD story line drags.The story becomes fragmented and not worth spending time watching.The set designs are accurate but don't make up for the disjointed script.
3,Movie is OK - not like Amadeus - and it's in French so be aware,"This is an OK movie, but if you were looking for something along the lines of Amadeus, you'd be mistaken. This is a French Film with English subtitles, which to me detracted from the movie. For me personally, it wasn't worth the price and I'm sorry I purchased it - but you don't know until you try."
2,I wanted to like this but...,"This film just didn't do it. I enjoy period dramas, have watched most of them, was not expecting an exciting plot, or fast moving story, but half way through, it really fell flat. There wasn't enough material to make a film about. Or the director didn't showcase the material well. I don't know which. After the film made it clear that her talents weren't appreciated, there wasn't much more to tell. She was a great talent, and it was unfortunate that she wasn't given her due. Marie Feret was very good. I wish the director had spent more of the film in closer observation of her and not so much on her family which seemed like ""filler"".The reviews on the DVD cover are exagerated. There is so much film garbage out that this seems like a good film in comparison. But this film was disappointing. I was really expecting to like it."
5,Excellent tool,"Took out 8X12 foot 6 inch reinforced concrete slab in 4.5 hours. FYI, bull point tool gets hot during use, use care if you touch it before it cools. It's long cord is really helpful. DeWalt tools are usually quite good and this is no exception."
4,Grrrrrreat!,"Thrilled with this product. I may have to do some conditioning to wear it comfortably as it weighs over 25 pounds! I am 6'3"" with long arms and a slender build. The mail shapes to your body but the sleeves are a tad short on me, better than being too long, however. For the price you cant go wrong and this will certainly be a hit at parties/funerals/grocery store/beach."
1,"Medi-Cal ""Advantage"": legal welfare fraud or estate planning","This book fails to inform the reader of the pitfalls of being on Medi-Cal. It can be described it as a 'self help' guide to help people with money obtain benefits that are designed to help those who are most needy. From this standpoint it is unethical.Medi-Cal beds are often in short supply in better nursing homes, other Medi-Cal nursing homes are places that you would not want to set foot in. Medi-Cal rooms are generally wards often with as many as 6 beds to a room. Medi-Cal rooms are usually NEVER private.Why should the public at large ""in effect"" pay for your children's inheiritance because either you didn't have the foresight or were too cheap to purchase long-term care insurance.For the people who follow the authors' advice: BUYER BEWARE! When you are old, sick and in a 6 bed Medi-Cal ward, you won't be thinking of saving the family home.'LEGAL' WELFARE FRAUD OR 'ESTATE PLANNING' ?THINK TWICE!"
4,dark but rewarding,"This film is a very dark and twisting story, with a hidden evil character who is a perfectly nasty villain. The acting is strong ( with Matthew Montgomery in a supporting role, how could it not be ? ) and the script is smart. The actor who is the heavy did a very believable excellent job and the supporting cast was very good, as was the lead actor. The set of the ( actual ) Appalachian resort lodge worked nicely as did the music. The slow uncovering of the hate-filled fundamentalism of one of the characters was handled effectively. Sometimes creepy to watch, it holds your interest."
4,"AMAZON: IS THIS MOVIE ""WIDESCREEN"" OR 1:33 ???????","AMAZON: Once again someone was not paying attention in adding this movie to your inventory.First you say ""Format: Widescreen""Then below you state ""Aspect: 1:33""WHICH IS IT?Flight of the Cardinal"
4,A little dated but a good read.,Dont be fooled by the 2004 publising date most of the articles inluded here are from the late 90's early 00's. Otherwise a good read and well worth the $14 price tag.
2,Typical HBR compilation...,"The articles are, in sum, quite dated and general. Nothing leading edge here as the content is published through the HBS grist mill that greatly enhances the publishing record of their faculty but adds little of current value.Nevertheless, for the beginner in China, there is some knowledge here, but, again, keep in mind that the business environment in China moves fast and the information here was several years outdated when published."
2,Havard Business Review,"The collection seems dated; while several of the articles are helpful, the remaining bulk are consequently more misleading."
4,A Handful of the Essays Make the Book,"As others have mentioned, parts of the books are indeed dated (well beyond the 2004 publication date) but others offer a very nice introduction to doing business in China and understanding how China's development and history leads many of your counterparts to have a vastly different perspective on doing business (and life in general). While I'd advise ignoring entirely many of the chapters (selling consumer goods in China is pretty different today than ten years ago) the more fundamental and timeless stuff could be a huge help to anyone new to doing business in China and for those handful of essays the book is very worthwhile."
3,"Great instructions, but no yardage for quilts","This book has easy to follow instructions with diagrams and pictures to help illustrate, but no yardage is given for the quilts. There are several pictures of different variations of Lemoyne Star quilts, but no yardage for material needed to make the quilt. It would have been a perfect book if the yardage charts were available. It is difficult for novice quilters to calculate the yardage."
5,For Dry Eyes This Works The Best,"I've been using these eyes drops for 4 years now. I've had moderate to severe dry eyes due to climate and the medicines that I take. My ophthamologist recommended this product. If your eyes are really dry, be sure to get the version that says for moderate to severe dry eyes. Please note that the Liquigel is not the same as the other Refresh Eyes Drops. Be sure to get the Liquigel. I save at least $3 + tax for each bottle bought online versus the local store."
1,Very Fragile ....The Threading to screw lamps weak,Feel very cheated.The THreads are not screwable. Complete waste ... I am unable to use them. I forgot to return them due to lask of time.Also there was no excahneg as the item was not in stock.
3,Good looks,The lamp sure does look good.. but we had a problem with fixing the lamp as one of the screw was totally messed up and we had to add glue to fix the lamp in position....
5,nice light for the price,I have gotten a lot of positive feedback on this lamp from my co-workers as it looks way more expensive than it is. The only (small) issue is that the bulbs are those small candlebra type bulbs.
2,"Three good sequences, otherwise, it's a yawner!","The only three sequences that were really arousing were the 'circus sequence' and 'champagne sequence', both featuring the mega-implanted exotic dancer Pandora Peaks, as well as the 'harem' sequence featuring Barocca and two other nameless, semi-chesty girls. The Pandora Peaks segments are stunning for two plainly obvious reasons--her doctor should get a plastic surgery award for creating such nicely-shaped, yet gargantuan, works of art. The harem segment is erotic in the same way that steamy novels can be erotic, especially considering that the only thing getting between these three girls are some loufas and a bottle of bath oil! Otherwise, the rest of the film is kind of boring and did nothing for me. The gratuitous Russ Meyer segment was almost embarrassing. Yes, we all know Russ is a dirty old man now. He doesn't have to prove it!"
2,"If You Like Familiar Playmates, This Video Is Not For You","If you are soley into Large Breasts, then you might rate this video a ""5"". Personally, I liked the first one much better because it included mostly ""familiar faces/bodies"". When I buy a Playboy video, I expect to see many Playmates. Instead, this video includes many soft-porn/porn stars (which may not be a bad thing if you are into that...). If you want to see your favorite playmates, stick with the first VV."
2,Overated - overhyped,threadbare script .... they wheeled in Russ Meyer who was on his last legs for about 3 minutes .... this has none of the flavour and exuberance of any of Meyer's movies. A pure silicon fest with not much to recommend it ...... seek your thrills elsewhere guys.
4,Yummy!,"This video is fun. The scenes are titilating and enjoyable. A little hotter than most Playboy videos--some actual touching! And the music is good, too. This is a great video for breast officionados with a sense of humor. Not to be taken seriously and worth purchasing. You'll watch it more than once. It's worth the asking price."
4,if you like big hooters.......,this video is very good. all the ladies in it are very nice. and this video has a good variety of women. you won't be sorry with this video. better than the first one.
5,Awesome,"This book was in great condition. It was difficult to find, but well worth the money. Extremely pleased."
5,Wonderful set of locks!,I used these locks for each of my children and thoroughly enjoyed them. They definitely keep the kids out of hazardous places and they aren't too frustrating to open yourself! They had my son baffled until about 4-5 yrs.!
5,great product,"I bought these after my 9 month old son had figured out the normal push to release safety locks. I had read the reviews and it seemed that they might be difficult to install, but decided to give them a shot. I followed the directions that came with the locks and used the provided template. They work great, installation was not too difficult."
1,"Great concept. Works for 1.125"" or thinner cabinets. Sucks otherwise.","I bought this to defeat the prying hands of my 2 year old. I lost.The device is phenomenal in concept and even drilling holes did not deter me. I was able to get this to work fabulously for cabinets and pieces of wood under 1.125"" thick--before you add the ""Extension Slug"". In a sentence, any cabinet thicker than 1.125"" is entirely non-functional.The magnet that comes with the lock is great and strong--and activates the lock consistently across the 3 packs of locks I bought through 1/8"" of wood so long as you're not using the extension slug. The extension pin, however is fully functional. Once you add the extension slug, the device stops working entirely."
1,"Save your money, and your cabinetry","We thought these were a great idea. Although we weren't thrilled with the prospect of drilling into our cabinets, we did like that the mechanism seemed sturdy. After reading some reviews, I was concerned that the magnet might not be strong enough, but those reviews related to thicker cabinets (over 1"" thick), and ours are only 3/4"". Plus, in the store, the included magnet was strong enough to stick to our shopping cart through the packaging.At home, installation itself was pretty straight forward (though it never specified the size of drill bit to use for the anchor screws, and the bit size needed for the magnet locking mechanism was not part of our standard drill bit set). However, even when installed properly, the magnetic lock wouldn't release through the remaining 1/8"" of cabinet we hadn't drilled through. We even tried drilling a second set of holes in another location just to be sure. No luck. Good thing we have wood filler."
1,Make sure they will work with you cabinets first.....,"My husband and I decided to buy these locks only to find out(after drilling a hole through one of the cabinet doors) thatthey will not work with our cabinets, the magnet isn't strongenough to activate the locking mechanism although the door isno thicker than recommended.Now we have to fill in the hole with wood putty, good thing it'sa small hole!"
1,Great idea poor execution,"Like many others, I found the idea of a lock the kids couldn't tamper with fantastic. However the lock is very difficult to open even for the parents because the magnet isn't powerful enough to open the lock when mounted on the cabinet door.Hard to believe because when I opened the package the key would open the lock from about an inch away. Once we installed it on the cabinet it took a lot of struggle to get the lock to open. My wife amd most people wouldn't have the patience for this lock.I'm looking for a more powerful magnet from a hardware store otherwise I'm returning these."
2,Try something else,"This lock is great in theory, but in practice it's a pain to install and an even bigger pain to use. Perhaps my cabinets are too thick, but in my experience, it just doesn't work right."
1,what happens when they break???,"We purchased the tot locs after hearing rave reviews. After a couple of weeks of use, one cabinet would simply not open. Luckily there is a drawer above this cabinet and my husband was able to stick his hand in and open the cabinet from behind. We could see that the lock was broken. It had completely lost it's magnetic power--how, I don't know.Now we don't know what to do. If this happens again, especially on a freestanding cabinet--we're ""in trouble"" How are we supposed to open our cabinet if it breaks? The only way would be to ruin our beautiful new cabinets. We'll probably take them all out and go with the old-fashioned latch locks."
1,A YOUNG G. FATHER,What is use of getting peoples openion but make no changes?several people complain regarding the instalation print outbut still same print in the box.My son in law and I could not figure out how to instal with that Ant size picture and printout.Please make it more CLEAR with better explanation and picture.After I figure out how to instal I rate the lock it self.This rating is only for a very poor instalation direction.Apreciate if you email me a better one for anybody to figure out instalation.
4,Better instructions needed,"These locks are good but the instructions are horrible. I wish I could communicate with some of the other reviewers because I think they missed a key concept with these locks. The metal from the lock needs to be at LEAST 1/8"" from the outside of the cabinet door, this means if you have thick-walled cabinets you MUST install the extension pins when you put the lock in the door!!! This extends the metal from the lock into your cabinet and allows the magnet to unlock the lock. If you don't do this then the actual metal from the lock could be too far away for the magnet to have any effect on it.Another problem is that these can be VERY hard to install in drawers because you must install a mating piece on the cabinet face as well as in the drawer and there is little to no room with most cabinet drawers to get a screwdriver in to install the mating piece."
3,Not Recommended for Custom Cabinets with White Laminate,"After having heard rave reviews about this product, I ran out and bought the starter set. My husband and I tried to install a lock inside one of our cabinets, but unfortunately the magnets do not work through our cabinets. We have custom wood cabinets that have a white finish baked onto them. As instructed, we drilled almost all the way through our cabinet, leaving 1/8 remaining. The magnets only work if we turn the lock to a certain angle, which would not allow the latch to work properly. FYI to those with similar cabinetry."
5,"Great alternative, easy installation","Length:: 9:11 MinsAfter trying to use the standard latch style locks on our cabinets (which didn't give enough room to open once locked), I decided to try the Safety 1st Tot-Lok. I noticed a few reviews that said they were difficult to install so I decided to make this video to show how simple it really is. I'm no professional but was able to get the install time down to 5 minutes."
5,"Time consuming to install, but well worth it!!!","These locks took some time to install, however when you follow the instructions it goes very smoothly. The time now was well worth the ease in the future. Plus, after my daughter has outgrown the need for cabinet locks I can put them in their inactive mode. This is great because when we have future company we can reactivate them and the home is childproof again. Just be careful on cheap cabinets because you can drill through the entire door! Definitely a wonderful investment."
5,Great for teens too!,"Forget the babies! I put them on the snack cabinet to ensure there would be snacks through the end of the week. With a 12 and 15-year old, snacks dissappear very quickly when they aren't locked up. Hide the key and you are set."
4,Can't lve without,"This is the ultimate project planner for me. Instead of having pieces of my work in Word, Excel and HTML, everything nicely fits in OneNote. I downloaded the trial version. But it has become so indespensible I'm going to have to buy a copy. Having said that, this is version one. And I suspect Microsoft will have many improvements to make in future editions."
5,OneNote 2003,Received quicker than expected. The program operates as described but I have some issues with the amount of typing space it gives for each day. I also downloaded the FREE program RedNoteBook and like it better.
2,"Nice product, but not compatable with earlier versions of office","This is a nice product. I was excited at the prospect of being able to export my notes into Microsoft Word. However, Microsoft does not emphasize is the fact that you have to buy Word 2003 to make it work. Cutting and pasting doesn't even work except for small tidbits, very frustrating. I can not fathom that Microsoft did not know that So if you don't have Office 2003, expect to pay another $300 to buy the Office upgrade.It also OneNote files don't seem to be easiley transferrable from one computer to the next. If they are, they need to do a better job at explaining how to."
2,Not impressive.,"Onenote came with my new laptop (so I didnt have to put down almost $200 on it) I find as college student, it's too much of a hassel to type instead of writing the old fashion way. I used Onenote to take notes on a movie for a class and it was a hassel. Also there's no way to save. If you want to type your note save money and use Word instead."
2,GREAT!,"I CAN'T REALLY WAIT TO GET MY COPY OF THIS, BY THE LOOKS OF THE SCREENSHOTS THE GRAPHICS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!11i THINK MICROSOFT HAS REALLY PRODUCED AN EXCELLENT PIECE OF SOFTWARE THIS TIME IVE NEVER PLAYED IT BUT MY FRIENDS TELL ME ALL HOW COOL IT IS OMG!DEFINATELY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF STICKY NOTES, OR YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO TYPE YOUR NOTES INTO NOTEPAD, THIS PROGRAM IS PROBABLY WORTH THE MONEY SO BUY IT LIKE I DID^"
3,Our first Brambly Hedge book,This is the first Brambly Hedge book for us. I read such wonderful things about the classic series but was a bit disappointed in this latest addition.There is a very brief introduction to everyone and how they relate to each other. Then the story jumps right into the Hide and Squeak game. My 5 year lost track of who was who and never connected with the characters. He barely cared that baby Sissy was floating away. He's very much into heroes these days and he did like the part where Wildred found Sissy.I'm looking forward to reading the original Jill Barklem books with him.
3,Pretty Good,"Not a bad game at all. To repeat what others have said the story is fairly boring at the beginning but it picks up somewhat. All the different styles are neat but you really don't get a chance to use more than two or three of them, unless you want a bunch of mediocre styles.It is fairly easy, I died once in the entire game before reaching the end game boss where it took me three tries to win. It's not as easy as Fable though.I had a good time playing it but I have no desire to play it again. Buy it used."
2,Rent this game before you buy it,"I was rather disappointed with this game. Especially after reading all the hype about it. And it being done by Bioware. It did not meet up to my standards of RPG,s..Not near enough options for your player from the get go. Graphics aren't near as good as I heard they were. When your flying around in the aircraft in this game, it looks like the old astroids game. It was a real let down. Especially because I bought it when it first came out. 50 bucks wasted. I bought the special addition of this game as well. I would hate to see the normal version......."
4,In The Fashion of KOTOR,"I believe this game is alot better than the resent KOTOR II. The graphics are pretty decent. However there are flaws to this game but they are very few. I wonder if Bioware had done KOTORII, it would've been alot better. The story to this game seems like a Star Wars rip off but a well done rip off. The graphics are pretty impressive and the gameplay is solid in and real time."
2,rent it dont buy it,this game is extremely short i beat it in two days. it is also repedative. it is very easy even on hard it is easy. the game does have good graphics and it does have a good story but it isn't very fun. I definately reccomend you buy this game. I would have given it a better score if I didn't pay 50$ for it.
2,Disappointing,"This game has some beatiful scenery, and...well, that's about it. This game commits the cardinal sin of video games: it's very boring. And I'm a huge fan of KOTOR, so I'm not averse to talky talkiness, but the generic story, tedious combat, and uninteresting stat/ability system caused me to sell this game quicker than any game I've ever had. Just beware."
4,Wife loves it,"I got this for my wife and she loves it, plus it makes her smell like coffee which I love.The only problem I saw with it is that it's oily when you put it on.Not a good thing for me since I hate oily stuff but since my wife's the boss...if she doesn't mind then it's OK by me. :)"
3,Don't judge this book by its cover.,"Based on the cover, I thought this was a series romance (and I guess technically it is since it is part of the Highland Fling series), but it read more like a single title. It was somewhat wordy, but the writing was technically proficient and the descriptions were evocative. If you like the use of regional dialect in historicals, then this is probably a good selection for you. The heroine felt flat and unengaging to me despite the author's having given her the requisite flaw (crippled hand) and a unique ""hobby"" which played into the plot. I found the hero likeable if not particularly memorable. The villian was sufficiently villanous with no complexities of character to divide our loyalties. Overall, this is a better historical romance than some I've plowed through in the last few years, and if you haven't guessed by now, I'm a demanding critic."
5,A Thorough and Fresh Look at Ancient Greece's Acropolis,"Jeffrey Hurwit's compelling way of introducing the reader to an Ancient Greek marvel is both fun and informative. You learn anwsers to things you would personally want to know like ""Could the average Greek enter the Parthenon?"" A great ""bread and butter"" book to have on hand if you are at all interested in art or architecture."
5,GREAT BACKGROUND READING,"Reading things like the Military Instructors Manual in addition to thriller and action fiction, which I enjoy most, I find gives me a broader depth and background toward understanding the background concepts that underpin the fiction storytelling. The procedures about how to operate weapons, for example, as described in this and other manuals like it, always help me get a better handle on what I'm reading when I tackle a thriller, such as Snake Handlers or Under Attack, which I've also reviewed. Being able to download these to Kindle is a terrific advantage.Thanks, Kindle!"
3,Great! But left off the crown,"Really wonderful anthology of most of Johnny's greatest, but literally, ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone?"" That's my absolute favorite. Why couldn't it have been included here? What will happen when my vinyl wears out?"
1,they suck a ton,"i ly got this album mistakening it for another band and i didnt even listen to the whole thing! When i heard the first song i said, ""this sucks!"" Dont buy it!"
2,New Formula Ruined Product,"I was using this product for several years, buying 7-10 bottles a year to use for myself and as a supplement to gifts. Since the new formula has been released, it is no longer a good product. It does smell more like olive oil and lost the lemon oil smell as other reviewers had mentioned. While lemon oil shows higher on the ingredient list now, I suspect it is of a lower quality. Something is off about it. The consistency is also thinner. It no longer feels like a good quality lotion. It would best be compared to a facial cleansing milk consistency now (which Avalon has and I used until that formula changed for the worse as well). I have given this version a chance for the past three months, but lately have been reluctantly getting through the bottle. I will find another brand that maintains their quality."
4,Great product! Bad shipping.,Can't give 5 stars because it arrived with lotion all over the outside of the bottle. The lid was partially unscrewed. I don't think very much of the lotion was lost otherwise I would have sent it back. But it shipped very quickly and was exactly what I wanted.
3,not the same,"Not more sustainable as advertized and does not make my skin feel as soft as before . Before i could use the lotion in the morning and my skin would feel soft all day, even during the cold weather. Now half way thru the day I have to re-apply the lotion. I'm disappointed because I waited to long to find a retailer. I ordered this product from you before and was very pleased but since it's new and improved I don't know."
5,Peppermint Lotion,"This product smells soooooooo good. I use it all the time when I need to relax. Especially at bedtime, so I can sleep."
1,Not good,"I was re-stocking the guest bathroom and bedroom and got the bright idea to get a collection of Avalon, which I've always liked, so everything would match.The lavender scent is not pleasant and is not the lavender I am used to. In addition, the way the products are labeled it's almost impossible to tell which is lotion vs hand wash without a lot of light and glasses.The ""off-lavender"" odor of the lotion is very strong, almost overpowering, and the lotion itself is cloying and greasy.This was not a good choice at all - I should have looked more carefully at packaging and such before purchasing. But who can mess up lavender? Avalon. That's who.Can't recommend."
1,Last batch smelled funky,"I've loved this lotion and ordered it regularly from Amazon or scored it in stores for more than a decade. But the last two bottles I received from Amazon the other day smelled funky. Gone was the delightful peppermint aroma, and in its place was a powdercake face make-up type of smell mixed with the scent of unbathed intimate body parts. Something must have gone wrong with this batch! I think I have to throw it out. Sad. Miss my peppermint lotion."
1,Not Organic...,"I bought this ""organic"" lotion because I wanted something natural and healthy to moisturize my skin. Well its not natural, just check out the first few ingredients. It does contain some quality essential oils, but its still made with other fake crap, and I find it to be very misleading to market it as organic when it isn't. Very disappointing..."
5,Don't order from Direct Super Center!,"This product is great - my wife has used it for the past 2 years and loves the true lavendar smell and great moisturizing if gives her hands. But don't order this product from Direct Super Center, one of the vendors available on Amazon! First, they were out of stock which I didn't find out until I emailed them; then they sent it to my P.O. box but it returned to the vendor (never found out why); then I had to call them to get them to send me the product directly to my home in time for Christmas. Finally got it, but all of the bottles had leaked a little through their caps. Find a different vendor for this fine product."
5,love,"I keep it by my bedside and use it on my hands before sleep. It has a very nice, clean, earthy lavender smell. It also has a nice clean residue, not at all oily. Also not sweet at all like some others I've tried."
2,Leave hands greasy and shiny,I love peppermint and that's what originally got me to buy this product. Unfortunately even a little bit of this stuff leaves my hands greasy and shiny.
4,Especially delightful in audiobook form.,"This review refers to the audiobook version.With Will's Irish narration and a few of his tin whistle passages placed here and there, the unabridged ""Messing About In Boats"" really comes to life.Millar's humorous and sometimes sentimental recollections are best told here by the man himself.It's like sitting next to him at dinner as he entertains you with his folky Irish humor and style.This is one of those instances where the audio version is actually better than the print version."
1,"Stick to singing, Millar!!! Your writing is crapppp!","The guy cant sing anymore so he is trying his hand at blarney fiction. If he had stuck with the rovers he might have finished his career in style, but, as usual, these so-called ""superstar"" singer's egos get the best of them and they think they can forge a career, writing or otherwise, on their own merits. Willy-nilly stuff!!!"
3,E-commerce Principles,"The internet keeps changing so quickly that any book in print tends to be outdated as soon as it hits the bookstores. The downside to this book is that it was published three years ago. Nonetheless, it is worth a read. The nine principles of doing business on the web which Schwartz outlines still hold today."
4,"Good summary of Web marketing, but need more theorization","I chose this book as one of my references when I was preparing my thesis on Internet Marketing. My feeling is Schwartz had found something from the chaos, but he still did not draw out a clear and systematic theory for this field. He just listed the key points in this book from which it is for us to summarize a logical plot. I hope in his up-grade version we can find a real up-grade thoughts."
4,Insightful but could be trimmed down some.,"I found the reading both easy and insightful, but I got the feeling that at some points the author could have made better use of the length of some of the text. This collection of principles should be examined by any one interested in ""reaping"" any kind of profit from the web. But you'll have to tread though some discussion that struck me as somewhat unecessary to proving any given point being made by the author. Bottomline: Worth the read, but it won't become a permanent part of my personal library."
3,Easy Reading ... but I craved more meat,"This book was an easy interesting read. It did a good job covering the basics of web economics through several real world examples. However, I wish the book had gone into more detail ... especially in the chapters near the end of the book."
3,"pithy, poignant","This book relates many of the essential characteristics of a ""successful"" internet business. It is an easy read. At times it seems a bit superficial, but overall an excellent introduction to business on the web."
5,Essential information in building an effective website,"An eye opening guide to building and maintaining a quality website which users will enjoy visiting. Clearly lays out the essential elements users expect in a website to which they will want to return. Regardless of the type of business, the information in this book will provide a valuable tool toward improving your website and growing your internet business."
5,Comprehensive 'common sense',"I read Evan Schwartz's 'Digital Darwinism', which I find highly engaging . So I bought 'Webonomics' & find it equally enjoyable & pragmatic despite its earlier publishing date. Although some friends claim that the principals illustrated in the book are simply 'common sense', I find these 'common sense' to be highly concise & comprehensive."
5,"All we need is ""Webonomics""","""Webonomics"" is a handbook for successful people who want to do business in web. It is easy to understand and useful. Those principles seems like common sense, however, they can draw excellent and remarkable conclusion in your mind.That book has lots of examples, although some are from 90', they can still show clearly about the concepts.It's worth to buy and keep."
3,"New principles,but not brief","I have read this book two times.I work for MetaLadnd.com which is internet shopping Mall company.So much available but need to brief.because each chapter have similar topic.I just felt the author said same principle,'the value of web community'that come true through continuous interactive relationship. I think nothing else but it.but I agree that this book is neccesary to all the internet worker. If you are in the beginning of internet business, read it just twice.Or select new updated version."
4,A book for every businessman,This book gives an insight for doing business on the internet.Essential principles are lucidly explained without using technical jargon
3,Well written but now outdated,"Things move so fast in today's world that this book - while insightful and well written - is now old news. The book makes reference to Pentium 120 computers, 14.4 modems, AOL hourly pay plans and $2000 inexpensive PCs."
5,The true wisdom of internet commerce at its essence,"Webonomics, explains what internet commerce is,how to achieve it and mantain it.this book is easy to read, and powerfull enough to take you and your business to the top."
5,"A ""PARADIGM SHIFT"" FOR SUCCESSFUL ONLINE MARKETING.","Based on (obviously) extensive investigation and documentation, Evan Schwartz reveals the big differences between traditional advertising and marketing and what has really been successful on the Internet. What works? Instead of ""mass media"" blasting, Schwartz found that the most successful web sites (regardless of size) incorporated personal interactive techniques, as well as targeting their audience as a means to attract quality consumers. This very easy to read and thoroughly enjoyable book offers real examples, backed up by documentation (not theory), and is an invaluable lesson for any person or business venturing onto the Internet for profit. The numbers don't lie, and the big boys don't always get all the marbles. This important richly detailed book will tell you why ""you gotta change your thinking"" to make it on the Net."
3,"Good 10,000 foot overview, but ""Where's the beef?""","After 200 pages, I had only 10 notes in the margins. Something was missing. Schwartz does an excellent job of scoping out the field, but neglects to close the loop. His insights on loss of Brand were excellent, but then he never turns to a means of managing brand. The missing question: How do you deliver a value product in a media that is very price oriented? Where is the ""average"" customer (not the customers of Dell or Schwab)? The debate over Value Currencies is undecided -- usually the consumer fails to utilize these offerings, and they appear to drive the same price over value arguments. While I agree it's a must read, I'm looking for volumn 2..."
3,10 obvious observations for the web,"perhaps I am overly down on the book since we do commerce on the web. the simple fact is that many of the books observations are things that a rational, thinking person would get.Like the value of good customer relationships and brands. Also, many of the examples that he cites (like the IBM cybermall) are tanking. Finally, this guy seems to think that ""points"" are some magical elixer. We looked at them and quickly realized that they don't work and are a pain to administer. Worth reading but use your brain."
5,A great reference guide to have if you are a diabetic.,This book is a great guide to have if you are a diabetic. The information is written well and easy to understand. You will go away a more informed person about your diabetes. It has truly helped me to gain the knowledge I need to help me cope with this disease.
5,Great book. A must have for diabetics,"A great book. A must have for diabetics. That said another must have book is ""How to reverse diabetes without drugs"" Neil Bernard ."
3,Nothing New,"I just received the September 2006 edition, the ""latest and greatest"" paperback... Nothing New here, plus Amazon charges the list price $7.95... I am sure you can get it at a mega bookstore for less"
5,A must read for the new patient,A very comprehensive discussion regarding all aspects of the condition. Well written and organized. Excellent discussion on diet and excercise. Very enlightening for a pre-diabetic. A must read.
2,Just Light Weight Stuff,If your looking for detailed guidance on some of the problems of diabetics you want find it here. Was this written by people knowledgable in the field? Examples: If a antibiotic salve takes more than a few days to work call your doctor; slow healing is directly related to poor blood sugar control. Otherwise all cursory stuff you might find in pamphlets at the doctor's office.
2,Much too small,The picture of the pendent on Amazon looks much larger than the actual pendent. It is difficult to see the diamonds at all. I returned it.
4,Very pretty,"I bought the necklace as a gift for myself. I didn't really have any expectations as to how it would look, I just thought it looked beautiful in the pictures. And I was pretty much right, it's not as large as I thought it'd be but it is a very pretty piece to have. It has adds a great shimmer to your look and it can be matched with a dress or a simple top and jeans. I would buy it again and maybe an extra one for my sister."
1,"Lots of bugs, packaged with unfriendliest customer service","Bought originally 10.1 version , then downloaded update since I am using Panther now. FAXstf X 10.5 constantly crashes, or cuts incoming faxes off in the middle. Called customer service (no 800 number - 20 min hold time) - a very unfriendly customer ""service"" agent explained that since I didn't buy FAXstf X for Panther, but downloaded the update, I do not qualify for customer support.I use a lot of different software products for OS X, but this is the most problematic product with the worst customer service I have ever experienced.Well done - SmithMicro!PS: Buy PageSender from SmileOnMyMac instead: half the money for a much, much better product (http://www.pagesender.com)"
1,Should not have been released,"Love Shah Rukh Khan and I have a pretty extensive collection. I had not heard of this movie and wish I hadn't seen it. I ordered it; watched it and found it to be a poorly made movie. Badly written, badly shot, badly directed. After viewing the movie, I found an article online that the movie was released at a time when fans were buying anything SRK - and I was one of them. This movie is now a part of my collection and I will never watch it again."
2,What a STINKER!!!,"I am a huge Shah Rukh Khan fan and love just about all his movies, but without a doubt do not like this one! Unfortunately, I bought it because 1)I love SRK, 2)couldn't find this movie to rent, and 3)figured it would be good because most of his are. I totally agree with the other reviewer about this movie--VERY CONFUSING, like she said--disjointed and didn't flow, and Shah Rukh was hardly in it! At the beginning of the movie it starts when the kids are young then tells you it's 10 years later and they're in college...and then jumps from????????? They don't fill in the huge gaps in between and then it just continues on like that. It was very weird. There was no smart dialogue, the acting wasn't that great and not even any catchy or memorable songs! If Shah Rukh had not been in this movie at all, I would've given it no or 1 star, but since he was in it--even barely--I give it 2 stars. If you're an SRK fan, SPARE YOURSELF time and money!"
2,Puzzling Film,"I purchased this film because I am a Shah Rukh Khan fan. This film was released 10 years after it was made. I don't know, but I am guessing that Shah Rukh Khan didn't have any input in this one getting released. It seemed to be pieced together, didn't flow well, and left me and those who viewed it with me confused."
3,Uncommon indeed,"The book started very well. It flowed very smoothly, but the gripe that I have is the style that Rosetta used in writting. I know this is not the editors fault by any means, but the author stumbled into a rut of constantly complaining, saying how she would never make it back home and the fact that she didn't want to come home, due to it not beeing right to live there. I understand that life was expected to be short lived when joining either side. I just didn't expect the letters to be filled with mortal mindedness. Just seemed like she complained more then she had something good to say. This is all my opinion and you can take it however you like."
5,A must-have about one of many women's role in the Civil War,"Lauren Cook Burgess has given us an important look into the heart of one (of what is turning out to be many)woman's story who fought dressed as a man in the American Civil War. Crossing the gender line was not just a daytime exercise for these women and Wakeman's revelations about what it was like for her to live as a man amongst men who were serving their country.Driven more by economics than patriotism, Wakeman's letters reveal a woman who desired to be economically self-sufficient and who embraced one of the few options available to women in the 1860s by cross-dressing. It is a fascinating read for what it tells us about gender, war, comraderie, and the economic stresses that women from poor backgrounds faced in the 19th century.It is a miracle to have this information, scant as it may be, so that we can celebrate women's achievements in this bloody war that claimed so many young lives and literally changed the course of U.S. History."
5,Great Saw,I've used this metal saw for about 3 years now... Its cuts metal material very well... Never had an issue or problem with it... Cuts always come out clean without burring...
5,Swell,"Product came when promised - a little longer than I wanted, but as promised. They also upgraded the software so this was a plus."
3,Solid but now 2 years old...,"Just finished reading this. Had I read this book two years ago, I suspect it would have been a 4 or 5. Even two years later the book is pretty solid. Who is this book not for? People who already know their way around osCommerce a little bit. You won't learn much new. Therefore, it is for newbies (such as myself) - right? The answer is kind of. Chapter 2 on the development environment may leave you a bit frustrated. If you are completely new to programming on the web and some its technologies, find another book that has a more current description of how to set up your development environment. If you don't mind struggling a bit or have ever developed code on your computer, you will be fine. Assuming you get through Chapter 2, the book is pretty good at providing just enough information to wet your palette. Certainly walks you through examples as well as leaves some for yourself...good way to learn."
5,because of this book I have an online store,I purchased this book to help me get my online store going for the artwork i create. In a few short weeks after reading the book and using it as a guide for my site i know have a fully functional online store that can be found through search engines. Check it out if you are curious. www.paintedphotography.com
3,Not for those who know OSC,"I have been using OSC for over 2 years now, however, do not have the knowledge to fully customize the cart. I hoped this book would do that, but it did not. If you have never used OSC, this is a good book, if you know OSC, and are looking to improve on it most likely nothing is new. For example the contributions covered are the RSS feed, and Easy Populate. Talked alot about using Paypal, install and setup. However, I find very few good technical books, all of them are either A)Too Basic for my knowledge level, or in the case of O'Reilly book, assume you invented the computer, and are above my ability."
3,Vague,"The more I read about this man and Avatar, the more it seems that he is purposely vague to get you interested in this really expensive Avatar course, where you really get what he wants to teach you. Seems like he has been very successful at getting people to sign up. This is an okay story, and there are good pictures and diagrams. I plan on rereading this again, to see if the parts where he goes into consciousness are vague like I said, or if they are actually intelligible. But, I'd recommend you skip it."
1,not worth it,"the dremmel gets very very hot, very very quicklyI am actualy afraid of melting the thing. A minute of use and you realy want to put on a pair of gloves. It never got hot enough to burn me, but was too hot to justify not using gloves. And by using gloves you just end up blocking more of the airflow (lovely how the vents get covered by your hand) thus getting the thing ever hotter. The accessory kit is very deceiving - most of what you get are cheap cutting wheels (not the good reinforced ones - not 1 of those) and sanding drums - each counting as its own ""piece"".Its unwieldy, not comfortable, if you want to do anything you have to buy tons of expensive acessories. Also the thing screams it is so incredibly loud at higher settings. Everything about it is a hassle."
3,Works well but accessaries are questionable,The actual tool itself seems to be quite good but the quality of the accesories are quite questionable. The cutting blade broke on me 45 seconds into using it. I used it to cut a baseboard! Not like trying to slice titanium rebars or anything.!
3,"Works well for some things, doesn't do everything they say","My wife bought one of these for me as a gift. I had mentioned a couple of times it might be nice to have one... I don't know what came over me. The tool works great for details and doesn't work for much else. I have used it for a number of projects where I needed to file or grind something small... screws in a part that were 1/64th of an inch too long kind of thing. It works great for that, I don't have to apply much preassure to the item being ground. I tried using it to polish a pot (it's in the list of projects to do with your dremel) ahhhh... don't bother, threw polish compound everywhere because of the speed of the tool. Works far faster with a rag by hand. Or better yet... a big buffing wheel on a bench grinder. Works well for engraving too. Haven't tried it for much else. I think my wife will end up using it more for crafts than I will for the kind of stuff I do."
4,"Great product, just a minor complaint","I love the Dremel. Works like a charm including the flex shaft. Make sure you read the directions on how to use the flex shaft, specifically the proper operation. The dremel motor should be held (or hung) above the business end of the flex shaft for proper usage and safety.My only complaint- minor- the accessories are all lumped together in bags with no labels. You have to go through the manual and match the pictures with the accessory and sometimes with ambiguity. I eventually figured it out and used a label maker to make things better. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It gets 5 for performance and 4 for packaging."
4,The best rotary tool ever!!!,"This is a great product. I highly recommend it. It's very powerful and there are so many different applications for the flex-shaft adapter (which is the main reason I purchased this kit). The price on Amazon.com was great because it was an open box item but this is easily worth about 50% more than the highest price you can buy it for.The only downside is that you're really only buying the dremel, flex-shaft, and case. There isn't a very wide variety of tasks you can perform with the included accessories. So an additional accessory assortment is a must."
3,Less than pleased...,"In my opinion, rotary tools are very useful. I have both the rotozip and the dremel tool. I can't say for the rotozip but I can say for the dremel is that is meant for light duty (Both are made by the same company). I bought this kit but my storage box was a bit different. As with most bosch tools I have found that if they give you a storage box... it barely holds what comes in the box, don't buy anything else for the tool and expect to store it in storage box enclosed. Mine lasted about 5 years but I rarely used it. When I did use it, I typically used it pretty hard. I had it running for about 15-20 minutes cutting off wooden dowels when mine died. I would recommend this tool but be sure to let it cool off and don't use it for long periods at one time. Use the rotozip for the heavy stuff."
1,Warning!,"This rating is about honesty. I haven't tried this tool yet. I got really mad when I realised that out of the 77 advertised accessories 46 are little round pieces of sanding papers. Contrary to what is advertised there are no carving, engraving or routing possible because there are no such accessories. You now have to go and buy those."
3,Good quality tool. Limited uses in my opinion.,"I got this basically for free from Amazon. One of those $75 off $200 deals. I bought a $125 item, then tacked this on at a cost of $75... so basically free.In my opinion, this thing is practically useless. I've tried to use it for various tasks, but have found I already have a different tool that does the job better. Maybe if you don't have a good assortment of grinders and polishers, this would come in handy.The quality of the tool seems to be very good however."
4,Dremel Multi Pro Variable Speed Kit,Entire kit was purchased for a price that was only a little more than the tool itself. The kit comes with a flexible shaft which is a real plus to the user.Price and delivery was great.
5,Dremel - Puppy Nail Trimmer,"What a great tool - I don't know why I had waited so long to purchase a dremel. I have not really used it as a real ""Tool"" as of yet, But it is great for trimming my one year old golden retriever, Cisco, nails. The variable speed is the best so not to tear his paws off, and the sound is not as loud on a low speed so it doesn't spook him.Now if he would only hold still . . ."
3,"A Jekyl and Hyde tool, depending on its application","In a nutshell: This is a Jekyl and Hyde toolJekyl:The best tool on the market for lite work (lite meaning not putting a lot of torque & pressure & strain against a bit/accessory being spun by the tool).Hyde:The biggest waste of money for any type of heavy duty work. Will overheat, burn out and break on you. Mine did in less than a week. I went online and read numerous other reviews with the same symptoms, going back several years (of course I didn't read the reviews before I bought, thank you Mr. Murphy :) If I had only kept using it for pansy work everything would still be ok. lol"
4,I am satisfied with this tool,"I bought this tool to replace a dremel which I have owned for 25 years. I find this one superior to my original, I think the quality is good and the flexible shaft and accessories provided will cover all of my needs. There is plenty of room in the carrying case for everything included plus all of my own old tool bits. I like the corded model, I will never have to worry about a battery going dead or needing replacement. I think the price is fair for what I received."
5,Dremel tool,I bought this for a special job and it worked perfectly. The set included a special guide and stone to sharpen rotary mower blades. I tried it and it made a world of difference in the cutting power of my 4 year old blade.Be sure to wear hearing protection because it does put out sound that can damage your hearing!!!
1,Worked great for a year.,I bought this kit and the tool worked great for a year. I didn't use the tool often and about a year later (maybe 30 min of actual run time over the life of the tool) it ran for about 2-3 seconds and died. I purchased the black and decker rotary tool for 30$ and it's almost as good and doesn't break.
4,"Dremel 3956-02 MultiPro Super 1.15 Amp 5,000 to 35,000 RPM Variable Speed Rotary Tool with 77 Accessories","It is ""ok"". My response is that I figured I would use it much more than I actually did. This rating is more me than the seller. It is a Good tool if you think you will be using often. the variety isn't what I expected in parts."
3,"Lots of attachments, one doesn't work that well","This is a great tool for small projects/hobbies, however I can't recommend it for anything else. The Dremel rotary tool works fine, however I've never gotten the flexible extension hand tool to work correctly; sometimes it spins, sometimes it doesn't.I do find that the grinding and sanding discs break easily and it's no fun to run out of them in the middle of a project."
2,Accessories a disappointment,"While the tool itself is satisfactory, I'm very disappointed in the limited types of accessories that came with it. I had thought that the package would be a bargain with its 77 accessories, and that I'd have what I need for my simple projects, yet I now have to buy several more accessories at great expense to me because most of the accessories are similar sanding items.Also, the included polishing pads are not thick enough to cover the sharp metal point on the end of the attachment piece, so my projects get scratched from the protruding point! I'm very disappointed and discouraged about this tool package."
1,Dremel Junk,I recently purchased a new dremel series 400. My old black style dremel lasted for 7 years of abuse and finally wore out . During 2 minutes of light duty with the new 400 series dremel it started to smoke and get extremley hot! FIRE HAZARD?! Needless to say it diddnt work anymore. Thinking this a fluke I went to another hardware store and purchased a 300 series adjustable speed dremel. Guess what? SAME THING!!!!! I would highly not reccomend dremel tools because they obviously have gone to cheap components with this new generation. PASS IT ON!
1,don't waste time or money,"i got this for christmas. BOX MISSING PARTS. CALLED CO. AND GOT ""OH WELL""ATTITUDE. I MUST PAY SHIPPING 2 TIMES TO FIX THEIR SCREW UP. DO YOURSELF A BIG, FAVOR, SAVE YOUR MONEY ON A QUALITY TOOL."
2,Dremel Package Damaged,"Its a Dremel, what else is there to say. My low rating comes from the package arriving with no handle on the box and a number of the small disks to grind things broken in half.It turns fine. I wish the RPM speed went a bit lower for my use."
2,Outlook 2003,"Limited integration of standalone Outlook 2003 with word or office 2000.*The following from Microsoft Outlook 2003 deployment site:""If users upgrade to Outlook 2003 before upgrading to other Office applications, they will not be able to use Microsoft WordMail as their e-mail editor. The version of Microsoft Word must match the version of Outlook in order for WordMail to be available as the editor in Outlook."""
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I upgraded from Outlook 2000, mainly because of the claimed improvement in spam filtering.I am sorry to say that I did not like the new interface at all. It's overwhelming and crowded. The spam filter options are only slightly different from the previous version. And when I send out an e-mail, Norton Anti-virus takes five times longer to start scanning the message, sometimes resulting in a failed outgoing message.So I went back to Outlook 2000, and of course I'm now stuck with 2003 and can't return it. Maybe I'll try it some other day."
1,BEWARE: Outlook 2003 does not work with Office 2002 programs,Outlook 2003 does not work with MS Word 2002 as the e-mail editor. Reverse is also true. Ditto on all other 2002 programs andindividual program 2003 upgrades.- Copy and paste is even limited in formatting = a copied formatted text from Word to Outlook 2003 cannot be re-formatted.- Table option is not available at all.- Neither is picture formatting.- Forget mail merge!It's a waste of time if you need programs to interact.This is a deception on the part of Microsoft as they do not make this clear at all when your purchase individual program upgrades.
4,Need to fix PCS,"Generally good, but two bugs remain from before:1) Outlook PCS, which offers the only hope of exchanging with a PDA contact date organized into subfolders, is so buggy as to be unusable. A little effort by MS could make it great.2) Appointments still get totally screwed up if you change time zones on the computer. Have to work around by pretending that you're in your home time zone when you travel, but just change the clock time."
3,Outlook is good but it is not for everybody!,Outlook is a very powerful program that can do a lot of stuff but most users do not use more than 10% of Outlooks functionality. If you are one of these users I suggest not getting Outlook but look at some alternatives. For instance try Mozilla's Thunderbird email program. It is a very good email program with a lot of functionality and great spam protection. The best part about an alternative email program like Thunderbird is that it's free! Since Thunderbird is open source software anyone who wants to help work on it can. Thunderbird is worked on by millions of programmers around the world who want to use a better email program. It's user friendly and easy to install. Find it by doing a Web search for Mozilla Thunderbird.
5,wow,"I have two pitbulls who LOVE tug. This stupid looking thing is one of the best toys ive found. Its nice because it doesnt fall limp, which prevents them from accidentally nipping eachother when they really get into it. Hours of tugging,(never left unsupervised. if they were allowed to chew it, it would be gone in no time, its just for tug) its still in good shape..and its cheap!"
2,NOT for every dog,"It is a nice tug toy but not for every dog. It doesn't stand up aggressive play, it lasted 10 minutes with my amstaff"
4,proven brand,i have been fishing with garcia for years and it is as good now as it ever has been. for the money it would be hard to beat.
5,Great Reel,I really like this reel and have had no problems with it. I like the brake on it and it really helps with the stinkin backlash. Also very nifty is the alarm that tells you something is on the hook while trolling. It holds plenty of line and has no trouble winding back in.
2,I returned it,"I couldnt use this well. I couldnt cast this without it tangling and casuing a bundle of line. The reel seemed durable and well built, but I just did not have the patience to figure out how to cast this thing without it tangling."
5,6500c3 abu garcia baitcast reel,"these reels are a fantastic piece of workmanship, i have been using them for years,use them with a bit of common sence and they will last a lifetime."
3,"Exercise Tutorial, not a workout","This is a video that quickly walks you through 16 muscle building exercises and 2 cardio exercises for you to build your own routine from. It is not an exercise video.A great idea, but I wish that she had taken it one step further and included a 20min routine for you to follow. Yes, I could now do my own thing but I'm not that motivated. There is also a spot after each demonstration for you to pause and continue working on your own, but that requires juggling a remote, a baby and a ball.If you are soothing a baby by using a ball, you are likely already doing the first 5 exercises. If you are entertaining a baby, you are likely doing 2 -3 more.This would be better as a brochure on a website, rather than a dvd."
4,Botanic Garden Clock,"I would give this clock a 5 for the beauty of the design and the colors. I think a botanic garden kitchen clock is the perfect accessory for a portmeirion enthusiast and was very excited to receive it as a gift. However, at certain hours of the day (around 5-8 oclock and when time is near the half hour) it may be difficult to read the hands. But with that in mind, I still wouldn't trade it for any other kitchen clock now on the market"
5,The best item as a gift for portmerion-holic...,"I bught this for present. I have to have something for my supervior's family. They would be back hometown from U.S. So, I gave this to supervisor's wife. I thought she was very happy. She thanked to me several times. Another one thing I told is about shipping. After ordering with free shipping, estimation date was about One week later. However, what a surprised!!! Only three days were needed to be here. (Ordered:SAT------>Received:following TUE). How nice!!!"
5,Fast Ideal for an old dare devil skier back in the saddle,I have been an avid skier all my life. When I turned 55 I retired and bought a winter home in Colorado with my wife. I love these skies. I am an average weight male. I can easily accomplish steep hills without losing control. Even though I am an old dog I can still do tricks and these skies are perfect.
3,Before you order this book...,"...make sure you are aware that this is not the same book you might have seen in your public library for the past ten years. For some reason, the publisher (author?) decided to have the book republished with illustrations by a different artist. The new illustrations are pleasant enough, but they are nothing like the elegant mosaic-like paintings from the original edition. It's the same poem though, with its jaunty rhymes, catchy syncopation and meaningful theme (expresses the value of tolerance, sharing and friendship). I would have given this book a 4-star rating had it contained the original illustrations."
4,"From Freddy Gonzalez, Great Guaguancos from ""El Melodioso""","Great compilation of guaguancos from Alberto Zayas ""El Melodioso"". Tumbao did a good job with these recordings of the earlier time of Alfredo Zayas, the tunes ""El Vive Bien"", ""Yo No Tengo Amigos"", ""Desengano De Los Roncos"" and ""Consuelate como Yo"" are among the more acclaimed guaguancos of this group. Good CD. I did not give five stars because does not included recordings of his second era on the late 50's, when he appeared with his new sound playing son montunos, in which he incorporated musical instruments like the Tres Guitar, Trumpets with a tight percussion, mostly like conjunto style. Tunes like, ""Ponte Saya Colora"",""Mayari Monte Adentro"", ""Trangana"", were among the greatest son montunos he created bud sadly, are not included in this CD. For anyone who like a good original ""Afrocuban Sound""; Guguancos and Columbias, This CD it's the one."
2,Lonely little piano,Simply a piano played in what sounds like the church basement. A little too alone and high pitched for my tastes.
3,Too expensive for quality,"We purchased this set for alot of monye because we liked the pattern more than anything else we've seen. However for the money I figured at least the pillowcases and sheets would have felt softer on my face/body. while it looks really nice, it's not too comfortable."
1,bad product,This is the trird unit I have to buy the clock and motor does lasr up more that 3 monthe
3,feeder,"so far so good, only drawback is the spiral wiring, corn was getting held up, ended up cutting and its working great."
3,american hunter analog feeder,"I have used this feeder for almost 8 months. It has the ability to add all the whistles and bells and has worked alright until now. Clock always was a problem, but acceptable, just had to reset time always. Now the clock just quit working all together. I am trying to contact company to see what they will do about it. I have had several other feeders, other brands, with problems, and they have fixed them all so far. I will see. But all in all good feeder for the money, if the clock was better."
1,LEMON,"I ordered this to replace a non working feeder of this brand name, that was given to me by a friend. Since I had read bad reviews about it, I put batteries it and left it on the kitchen table to see if it would work correctly. It ran several minutes and the clock quit working. Changed batteries. Worked several minutes and it quit working again. Got box to send it back, but decided to try again and it is still working. I dread the day I have to replace the batteries and see if it will work again. This has a bad defect in it. It might work, and then it might not. Cinfirms what several other reviewers had said."
2,poor quality,I installed it in my hunting area... but it would not spread the deer corn but about 5 feet...the little motor doesnot have enough power to throw the corn as it should...
3,deer feeder,"This feeder is easy to operate and provides us with hours of enjoyment watching the wildlife visiting it. Using our five gallon metal bucket, we set it up in an hour and now only have to fill it once a week to keep the animals coming in several times a day."
4,More features than promised.,"Well engineered varmint guard. Easy to ""program"", set timer, etc. Removing cover to change settings is somewhat difficult. I was surprised to find more features than promised. Great value!"
1,junk,"3 months after I used this as a replacement for an old one, the timer quit working and therefor it would not dispense the corn and when I contacted Amazon about the issue, the 30 day return window had passed and they would not exchange it for a new one. I would think the timer should last longer than 3 months, that isnt even 1 season :("
5,Very successful gift for a med student,"I ordered this as a present for my brother, who's about halfway done with med school. He absolutely loved it and said he thought it would be a great conversation piece in his apartment and, someday, his office. It was packaged sort of obnoxiously (who still uses packing peanuts?!?) but otherwise, I have no complaints."
5,A Champion!,"Heidi's account of her on-going quest to comeback from paralysis is a beautiful statement of her courage, intelligence and spiritual knowledge. I finally got around to reading this book that a friend gave me and I am so glad I did. What she has to say is a message for all of us. A message on inner peace of understanding how we truly work...physically, emotionally, spiritually, mentally. She is a remarkable woman to not give up and to understand that the physical is just one element of who we are. Do yourself a favor and read this book."
2,Definitely written before the economic downturn,"Although published in 2001, it is easy to see that this book was written before the 9/11 disaster and the economic downturn that occured following that. This book makes some good points especially on the expanding role of the patient/consumer in health care, but some of the strategies discussed seem no longer applicable. It does, however, exemplify exactly how dynamic the health care industry is and how the best laid plans can be suddently dashed by forces external to the organization.One note of subjective personal opinion: The authors tone is somewhat arrogant. At times, the content seems like it is name dropping. As an administrator of a health care organization, I can certainly tell that the authors are not currently administrator's themselves."
1,Cards are not the same design as shown in picture...,"I received my Animal Wise deck from Amazon yesterday and was disappointed to find not the beautiful lavender cards shown in the photo, but a different version of the deck. This version contains most of the same stock-image type of photos, but a different border and text. The new deck looks to be more Native American inspired with a border of textiles and kokopellies.As a white person who is aware of cultural appropriation, I am a little horrified that I now own this deck."
1,Warning: Works with rotary laser only,"If you are wanting to use this with a stationary laser as I did, keep looking because this product won't work. Might be the best thing since sliced bread with a rotary laser, but that doesn't help if that isn't what you are using."
1,Poor quality and design,"The 'screw type' closing mechanism does not work well as the screw slips when you tighted the clamp. It does form a nice 90 degree angle if the clamp does not slip - I bought 2 clamps and only one 1 of the 4 screw tighteners actually works. I might be able to fix this by modifying the whole the screw tightener uses, but I shouldn't have to fix the poor design of this product. I will use another manufacturer next time."
3,not bad,I have to say that the leg connection to the barrel could be better and they should tell you that it comes with a battery. My biggest complaint so far is that it arrived with some rust on the barrel but pretty easy to set up .
1,Truly awful,"Outside of some minor airplay, this is truly a CD best left in the 80s. The one big (if you can call it big) song this artist has done was in Boogie Nights (sung by character Dirk Diggler) and was also in Transformers the Movie. That song is called ""The Touch"" I only suggest this CD if you absolutely cannot live without the song from these two movies."
3,"Not 5/8"" arbor","At the time that I bought this, the description included the wording ""with 5/8-Inch Arbor"" which should mean that the hole in the middle of the blade will fit a 5/8"" arbor. It doesn't, it is actually slightly larger than 3/4"" and actually measures .790, which is equivalent to 20mm. If you have a saw, like the DW934, and it has a 5/8"" arbor, you will have to use a 20mm to 5/8"" saw bushing to fit this blade to it. These bushings are available here on Amazon, I won't link to it, but you can find them if you do a search. I have brought the description error to Amazon's attention, so they may change it at any time."
2,Teeth fell off right away!,"I bought this for the cordless dewalt saw I have, but the first time I used the new blade, two teeth came off!! The next couple times of use almost all of the teeth are gone. Dewalt's reputation is severely tarnished in my view now (I have a ton of dewalt tools)."
5,DEWALT DW7763,Excelente servicio!Rapido y tal y como aparece en la foto.Excellent service! very fast! I recieved the item that i was expected.
5,Easy to follow Primer,"I am a Matsubayashi Ryu practitioner. And have been studing KI. This books covers all of the basic excercises I feel one needs to practice KI. It is easy to read and follow.With this book, not only can you devlop good Metods of KI excercises; but a positive outlook on life in general."
5,Great Bike,"My husband loves his bike. Suspension is good, ride is comfortable and sturdy. Get vehicle for the price."
5,I use this all the time!,"I love this book, the way it's laid out in alphabetical order and how many different entries it has is amazing. Some of the weirdest dreams end up fitting perfectly and it really makes you think. I have even brought this to work when coworkers are complaining of weird dreams! I love this book, its one I will keep forever."
3,Cheaply made but the kids love it,"This costume is made of thin, cheap material. The belt buckle is thin plastic and keeps falling out of the slits it attaches into. The hat does not stay on at all, even after I added elastic to the back. One of the costumes I got already had a velcro piece fallen off and I had to sew it back on. The arm bands are WAY too big, I had to cut the elastic and tie the ends as close as I could to get them to stay on. However, my 3 year old loves it. If your child is a die-hard Lazytown fan like mine are, this costume may still be worth buying as it is very hard to find Lazytown items. Be prepared to do some alterations though. If they are not going to be thrilled to have a Sportacus costume however, don't waste your money."
3,Cute,"This costume would have been cute on my son, if he liked to wear costumes. Anyway, the main outfit is nice, but the extras have issues. The cuffs were too large. I had to shorten the elastic to make them a reasonable size. The hat was too small and such an odd cut that I don't know how it would fit on a kids head anyway. But I still think it makes a nice little costume."
3,Little Guy was Happy...Mommy Not so much,"My son loves this costume he wears it almost everyday since Halloween. This costume is very cheaply made, the plastic emblem that goes on the belt kept falling off from the day we got it, and the black rope around the waist that ties has come apart as well. (On both sides). The goggles also cracked. The size of the costume was about right. My son is three, and he has room to grow into this. However, the arm bands could have fit my twelve year old and the hat could fit a newborn properly. All in all my son loved this costume, but I wish companies would make things better quality. Seems this costume started falling apart from day one. There is no way this cost a quarter of the price to make compared to what they are charging. Shipping and ordering was fast and no problems."
3,a bit pircey but alright,"got the product faster then the shipped was stated but i guess thats was the bounse,the hand cuffs are of cheap material buckel keeps falling off, and gogels will stay on the streachy cap no string for it,suit is a one pice jumper which so far sems okay but the ten logo is stapeld to to the suit it will detached,it is a bit to pricey but all in all the cosutme is worth it if u have a child crazy over lazy town and ""likes"" to dress up its worth buying"
2,Lovely book...,"Lovely book, wonderful photos of creative little retreats. Lovley word descriptions, too. But it was not what I was hoping for. Few interior shots that show how the spaces actually work. No floorplans, no useful information on how to plan or design a little retreat of your own. Lovely book though."
3,No Middle Ground,"The Retreats are mostly exceedingly expensive or wildly funky (it takes a special person to really enjoy a sojourn in a teepee). The photography is beautiful, which is a saving grace for the book.Perhaps this reader is overly attuned to comfort, but I was dismayed at all the circular stairways, ladders, and challenging skywalks to enter or navigate these homes-away-from homes. Some were set in such boggy, swampy areas, all I could think of were mosquitoes and other unpleasant insects. If readers are expecting examples in the United States, they will be disappointed; most of the retreats were set in the British Isles.The book illustrates a variety of settings: seaside, desert, mountains, lake and forest as advertised. ""Little Retreats"" is fun to read, but I would not recommend it as a practical guide."
1,"Offensive, tawdry, poorly-written trash.","If I could give this book no stars, I would. Mr. Guiliano is defintely slipping. Once a purveyor of entertainigly stretched truths mixed in with genuine fact in his previous Beatles works, Mr. Guiliano has gone into Albert Goldman's territory with this one. This book is a vicious, witless, tawdry collection of innuendo, half-truths and dubious ""eyewitness"" testimony. If you're they type that likes to go to the freak show to see the fat lady in a tutu, the human torso, and the bloke in the pit who bites the heads off of live chickens, you'll love this book. If not, avoid it like the plague. I bought it, I read it, I wrote the author a nasty letter and took it back..."
1,Poorly researched vendetta,"The author plays fast and loose with basic facts. As others have pointed out, among other things Lennon supposedly had a blow-up with his father at the Magical Mystery Tour premiere in the latest '60s -- which John somehow forgave in 1964. John supposedly had sexual fantasies about Madonna, whose first album came out after John was killed. The author can't even get the spelling of Patti Boyd's name right. This kind of ""reporting"" calls into question everything in the book. When I read about John's mother's supposed sexual advances to him, the first thing I did was look around for a footnote or other indication of source material, but none was to be found. And of course, the book is unrelentingly vicious to Yoko Ono, but that's to be expected."
1,More Garbage for the Uninitiated,"It is unfortunate that publishers are so willing to print books with cultural icons on the outside and pure excrement on the inside. For money of course. In the author's case to try to attach his name to a legend for his own immortality and self importance.Giuliano brings nothing to the Lennon story except an Enquirer-like stretching of the truth and suppositions that would make a fantasy fiction writer proud. Guiliano's best book was one with lots of pictures of memorabilia and rare records. Thankfully this left little space for his inaccurate ramblings.If you want to know about Lennon, stay away from this and other Albert Goldman-like trash."
3,"Check your love for John & his music, this is a bumpy ride.","Geoffrey Giuliano is a sycophant,the same type of toady that hung around John, Yoko & Sean & for which he has so much disdain. He has ingratiated himself to Yoko & Sean with pictures of them together in his book. I'll bet those pictures were taken before Yoko read this book. This is vicious book & not from one who admired or loved them. It is a book by a creature that stabs his dead victim once again in the back & twists the knife. John can't defend himself & everybody hates Yoko anyway. So there you are. He has a book to sell. Lennon had many demons. So does Giuliano. He has gone to the Beatles well too many times."
1,Fascinating but insanely bad,"There are so many obvious flaws in this book one has to wonder how many not-so-obvious things the ""author"" got wrong. Spelling is atrocious (people do a lot of ""pouring"" over papers, the baby was in the ""breach"" position). Unforgivably the ""author"" attributes Paul's lyrics from ""Getting Better"" to John to bolster his shaky suppositions. He continually refers to J+Y's sexual problems but doesn't say what they are - both impotence and John's supposedly insatiable appetite are mentioned. There are references to all sorts of things and people never explained. What was the ""black room""? Still, if even ten percent of the book is accurate, it's a fascinating portrait of how an emotionally vulnerable person was made pretty crazy by his famous circumstances - and by his manipulative, self-serving wife."
1,GUILIANO'S BAD KARMA,"Geoffrey Guiliano's book "" Lennon in America"" is a devious piece of lowly thrash out to make a few quick bucks.Mr. Guiliano has dedicated this book to his mentor and master A.C.Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada of the KRSNA consciousness. Being a hindu myself, i wonder how a genuine disciple of "" KRSNA Consciousness"" can sink to such prurient depths... or is it just the author living out his bad karma?As a Lennon follower one is left cheated because most of Lennon's supposed escapades ( as recounted by the author) are nothing but cooked-up hogwash without proof or substance.It is easy to write such books. I paid Rs 500/- for this garbage and i don't suppose Mr Guilaino will return the money back."
4,Lennon in America,"The true story of John Lennon. This is a good book because most John Lennon books don't talk about the many bad sides of Lennon--such as his drug additions and failure as a father to Julian. This is a hard book for a Beatle/Lennon fan to read at times because it says some stuff that isn't really nice. Overall, I think this is a good biography of Lennon."
1,Long Lost John,"I'm very sorry I put down thirty dollars for this book. Giuliano, who includes five pictures of himself in the photos section, takes every opportunity to portray himself as the sole crusader for truth in a world of profiteering phonies ruled by Yoko Ono. The number of small, snide, petty comments and uncorroborated accusations is staggering. Giuliano doesn't seem to think that accusations of rape, incest, and abuse need any more than anecdotal evidence to back them up, and very little of the book discusses Lennon's talent and genius. Giuliano also takes unprovoked potshots at Julia Baird and her book, which he had co-author credit on, oddly enough. The author has something to prove and his book isn't worth your time unless you're interested in seeing how Geoffrey Giuliano wrestles with his issues."
1,Giuliano At It Again....,"You think after seeing the other junk produced by this individual that people would learn. So, this message goes out to those that may not know Mr. Giuliano. Some of you may think ""Wow, this guy really knows what he is talking about."" Don't kid yourself. It's all his assumptions. This guy reminds me of someone who is given 3 dots on a piece of paper and is told to connect the dots and draws the Statue of Liberty. He will make up whatever he thinks fits or sells. If you really want to see how amateurish his Beatles work really is, check out BEATLES- A CELEBRATION dvd. Actually, don't buy it! Just go read the other reviews on this site. They alone will be enough to steer you clear of this man's Beatles meddlings."
1,Lennon in America,"John Lennon himself admitted his shortcomings many times in his short life, so this book comes as no shock to me. I read it out of curiosity and suspicion of what the author was up to. Almost everything in this book was revealed by Lennon himself during his life. Yoko Ono had nothing to do with breaking the ""Beatles Bubble"". Ego clashes did the deed. The greatest truth of all was written by John Lennon himself when he wrote ""All You Need Is Love"". It takes a coward to put out such a book when it's subject isn't around to speak for himself. And by the way....John Loved Yoko, so why should anything written by anyone else matter. Yoko was/is John's Angel like it or not."
1,Very imaginative,"This book is pure tripe. Particularly offensive is the outrageous suggestion that Stuart Sutcliffe an early Beatles band member and John's best friend died from Lennon kicking him in the head, and allegedly also had a sexual relationship with Lennon.Ok, we all know Lennon was flawed and insecure and paranoid and who wouldn't be having been abandoned by both parents as a child, and then as an adult having achieved fame wondering if people were interested in him because they genuinely liked him or wanted to exploit his fame and wealth.But this guy really goes beyond the pale by trotting out every half truth and rumor, and presenting it as the truth. If you are a Lennon fan and really want to read this book, just pop into your local bookstore and browse through it, you will get the general flavor. Do not reward this guy for pandering to the lowest common denominator."
1,IMAGINING DONE LITERALLY,"I think all anyone needs to know about Geoffrey Guilliano is that this man faked his own death to avoid being chased after all the money he owed.And he did it by taking advantage of the 9/11 tragedy where he had messages sent to dubious sources to say he'd been in one of the Twin Towers that day.After which his body was one of many never discovered thus saving any positive sighting of it and an obituary.At first he got a heap of sympathy messages on a Beatles websiteuntil he was rumbledIts Reassessment Time here.His Harrison book bears the blurb ""Guilliano knows more about my life than I do""Which is doubtful as Harrison threatened to sue him!So he no doubt added that himself1 Star is because you can't award lower"
3,Unblanced yet fascinating,"Lennon's lost years have always held a fascination for his many fans. This book while providing some insight is prone to exaggeration and fantasy. How could Lennon fantasise about Madonna when she had yet to release a record. As for claims that he slept with Linda mmmm I think not.I suggest readers consult other books on the same topic by May Pang , Fred Seaman and John Greene. These people did actually meet Lennon and not consult a bootleg copy of his journals.Not bad if you have not read the above books but seek them out first."
1,WHAT A BUNCH OF LIES!,"This book which claims to be based on the ""lost lennon diaries"" which it odviously is not is about 10% truth.Giuliano is a liar who does not have anything nice to say about John in this book which i wish i had never read because it was a waste of my time."
1,poor reading of life's downs,"I'd like to say, nicely, that the truth is a secondary object on these pages. The facts ARE jumbled, but it's the INTERPRETATION which is even more jumbled. His tales of Lennon's drug intake and sexual ""misconduct"" are told in the tone of the mid-to-high dudgeon of a disillusioned spiritual acolyte. Anyone who has walked, crawled, tried to run, in the fallow periods of the soul, will recognize Lennon's hypothermia. Giuliano attacks the star image - - walk lightly among this, we're in the hands of someone who doesn't know better."
2,A disaster in English!,"WHAT were they thinking? I can't believe someone with a supposed knowledge of English came up with this travesty! I am sorry for the singers who had to learn it and perform it! It is NOT a singer's translation and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the Italian.There are grammatical mistakes and cutsey but awful rhymes and if it is supposed to be in honor of Gilbert and Sullivan they are turning over in their graves! I tried to learn it and it just doesn't sing well or read well. Back to Ruth and Thomas Martin! And I hate to think what the other Chandos ""Operas in English"" series are like.I doubt I will try to find out."
3,Good If You Know Nothing,If you are planning to go to Japan and don't know a word of the language and need to learn some quick then this book will help. If you are already studying the language then skip it will become useless quick.
5,"Great Quality, Awesome Watch!!","This is actually my first kentic watch. I wanted to get something that looked very stylish, durable and precise. This watch has it ALL! I looked around for the same kind of watch and as a result ended getting this fine jem. The minute I took it out of the box I knew this was a very high quality product. It came with the usual instructions and warranty pappers. At first it feels a bit heavy, just a little. But thats what you get for a finely built product. Once wearing it for a while the feeling of heaviness goes away quickly. I want to say that the look of this watch is spectacular! The sapphire cyrstal, the stainless steel band, the stopwatch, and the awesome kentic functionality makes this watch a MUST BUY!!! A lot of my friends ask me what kind of watch I have and they are always interested in where they can get it. One word...Impeccable....this is a watch you will NOT regret in getting."
3,seiko arctura kinetic chronograph,"I have owned this watch for about a month. It is quite nice. But, it is a bit heavy. The titanium band may be more light, but is more expensive.What is most dissapointing about it is that the stainless steel band gets easily scratched. And, the design of the hour and minute hands could have been more fashionable.Nonetheless, it is quite nice watch for 250$."
5,Great watch for the money!!! Looks FABULOUS!!!,"I got the watch within two days from the ordering date just like Amazon promised. The watch is a true beauty for any gentleman out there. It looks great and very masculine. The watch is very well built and seems to be very durable. For $250, CAN'T COMPLAIN!!! I highly recommend it for anyone out there."
2,"""Very Little Lumination @ Night""","This is a very attractive watch, but was sent back, due to very little lumination at night. All to will see is a very small dot. Not very useful to me."
5,Very Well Done,"If you are interested in what the Bible (the Old and New Testaments) has to say about prophesy, I found this an excellent book. Charting the End Times manages to summarize the Bible in a easy to read book filled with many charts that help the reader visualize what is going on.The book is not perfect - the authors don't go into as much detail as I would have liked. But the authors have other books that serve that purpose. And in a few instances, their logic is questionable. But all-in-all, it was very well done. This book is intended to clearly show what the authors believe about Bible prophesy. They do a very good job of showing what the Bible says and then distinguishing what they think it means. Readers can draw their own conclusions.I'm fairly well-read on the subject and found myself agreeing with about 80% of the book. I disagreed with about 2%, and am still thinking about the rest... It is well worth the purchase price.Also recommended: Why I Believe (ISBN 0849937396)"
4,A picture is worth a thousand words...,"They say a picture is worth a thousand words. This well illustrated book makes visual concepts of the Bible like Dispensationalism and Prophecy. It answers questions like ""Why Sould a Christian Study Prophecy"" and ""How We Got Our Bible"".Though there are areas and conclusions I disagree with (email me for information)...over all it is a imporatant addition to any study library."
1,Confusing,"Not all of this book is about the end times.The time periods in the charts don't match up. i.e. one chart says one thing, another chart contradicts the previous. Two of the charts give two different time spans between creation and Christ's ascension.Ok, now for the theology. This is the same old faulty doctrine that's been reworded so many times that no one has bothered to see if the Bible actually says everything LaHaye is teaching..... I did check. The Bible does not support this view of the end times."
5,Great book!,"I am really glad I ordered this book! It has many easy to read graphs and diagrams which help to explain the prophesies about the End Times and track the events on a timeline. My church is doing a small group study of the book of Revelation, and this is very helpful to our study!! Several of the group members want to get books of their own!"
1,Piece of JUNK,"The old adage is true: you get what you pay for.I can't honestly say how far off the angle I tested this for was, because the clamp wouldn't hold the piece of wood in place, so the cut was bowed.I wasn't looking for hyper accuracy, just something to bang out a few 2x4s at 45-degs. It failed miserably in even this simple task. In order to finish the cut - the first cut - I had to place c-clamps of my own on the wood to hold it in place.P.O.S.Do not buy."
4,Really great doll house for a boy,Great house. Really easy to assemble and very large rooms! My boys love this house! Searched for a doll house suitable for a boy for a while. When I found this house I was pleased with its unisex appeal. I purchase the house with the basement addition and its huge!
3,adorable but poorly made,"We ordered this along with the Home Sweet Home dollhouse for my 4 year old's gift from Santa. We ordered it early to allow time to assemble. I love the way this looks and my daughter loves to play with the garage especially. But, the garage does not slide back as it should. It opens, but the groove for it to slide in in missing on one side. She is still able to play with it and she doesn't realize it is missing this feature, but it makes it much harder for her and I think she would enjoy it more. We did not want to return it after we had spent the time to put it all together and risk not having it here and together for Christmas, so we are just going to leave it as is or come up with a way to make the grooves. Overall, super cute and fun, I just wish it was made as it should have been"
5,"#1 BOOK ON DOS, SIMPLY THE BEST",Easy reading or browsing material. Very indepth yet categorized for quick easy referrence. This is definately the Bible for Dos. I highly recommend this book for your lap and your shelf! #1 in all aspects.
3,Basic Business Book,"Much of the book is about business basics. If you took out the word ""martial arts"" you could replace it with just about any other business. For what it is, the book is well worth the purchase price."
4,"Great book, very insightful!","I found this book very useful. You may not need to read it from cover to cover, but many of the sections are filled with some quality information."
5,Good Jamz,I wuz very satisfied with my purchase from this sellar. I wuld monst likely order from this sellar again if they happen to be selling something I want to buy.
4,"love,marriage and sex","Wonderful biblical view of love, marriage and sex based on the song of solomon. David Jeremiah does a great jobidentifying common issues we all face and he provides biblical insight into his counseling on the subject. He describes what the bible says about the issues."
1,Good for Three Haircuts,"This clipper should be considered disposable. We used it for three haircuts on normal boys' hair, and now it just pulls the hair and hardly cuts at all. It is supposed to be lubed-for-life, so I haven't added oil, although I am going to try that. I won't buy Remington again. The problem now is, even if they work at the beginning of a haircut, we don't trust that they'll finish the job, and cutting boys' hair is such a big undertaking at our house, we hardly look forward to getting the job half-done and then heading back to the store for another clipper to finish it. I wish I had saved the packaging - I would return these to the store where I bought them. Remington guarantees them for 5 years, but shipping them to Remington for repare or replacement would likely cost me more than the clippers cost. I'm completely unimpressed."
4,For those who like it short,"I really like my Remington HC-912. I don't have to oil it and the blades have an 1/8"" adjustment without having to use the accessories. I have not had any of the problems that the other reviewers had. Cuts my hair fast, accurate and clean. Can do my whole head in about 5 minutes by myself. I had it a year and use it every 2 weeks without any problems. Great price. Buy one!"
1,Awful,"This thing is awful. The blades are so dull, they couldn't cut a fart. I've used it twice and it just pulls on the hair while it barely cuts. You definitely get what you pay for and that's JUNK!"
1,Highly recommended if you're bald.,"This is an excellent scalp massager...what's that? There clippers? hahaha...huh? Oh you're serious?I have to say these are complete garbage. It took me an hour to end up with a worse job then my 10 year old clippers do in 20 min. It cuts almost as much hair as it pulls out, and you have to go very slow or plug it up. Granted I have very thick hair, so someone with only a few strands may find this a good deal. I however am going to try and exchange them for and old rusted knife to finish the job."
2,Terrible,"This was my first time using creatine. I was taking Nitro Tech protein before this. My experience was terrible. First of all each serving of this had over 70 grams of sugar. Second it is the lower quality monohydrate creatine not kre-alkalyne. Third, I didn't see results at all. In fact, I noticed my muscles were deflating. But that could have been because I stopped taking nitro tech protein right before this. Maybe it works but just not for me."
1,Watch out for the paid reviewers!,"Muscletech spends far more on marketing than research and I think that the BS in some of these positive reviews can only be explained by their running a write for pay campaign. 10lb muscle gain off one jug?? Come on now! I used several jugs a few years back and yes, I gained a little muscle, but NO more than I had using regular creatine and protein supplements.Considering the small fortune this product costs by comparison for no added benefit, go buy 20lbs of creatine and add your own dextrose. As an added benefit we won't have to see ads of Cutler and Wolf telling us that this is how they got so big... Sure, guys..."
5,excellent recovery drink,"MuscleTech Cell Tech is a good/best recovery drink. The muscles become nutritionally deficient after many years of exercise. I have been playing soccer for over 14 years and had developed chronic hamstring problems, until I experimented with this supplement. I have experimented with other supplements, different creatine blends and therapies to address chronic hamstring problems to no effect. I have found that MuscleTech is the ultimate treatment for my hamstrings."
3,Cell-Tech not Hardcore,This product hasn't worked as well as I thought. I have seen some gradual gains in 3 weeks as far as weights goes but not as much as i have hoped. I have followed the directions exactly as listed on the container.
2,Tropical Sprite on Creatin,"I purchased the tropical punch flavor and it immediately made my stomach churn. It felt like ""bubbly acid"" tearing up my stomach. Did anybody else feel the same way when they first took this product? I also take the cell tech whey and I love that."
5,On time and as advertised,"I received the product on time, as advertised and on perfect condition. Would buy again."
4,Color Code Calculator by Elenco,"Color Code Calculator by Elenco:Pro:includes color code display for resistors, capacitors, and inductors (back side);small (dimensions: 11cm X 5.3cm);good visible displayCon:the turning wheel of the 2nd significant figure is not properly cut and/or designed: when turning the wheel to ""7"" it becomes very difficult to turn it further to ""8"", and ""9"", because there is hardly anything of the top portion of the wheel that sticks out to turn. When reaching Zero (""0"") the top portion increases more and it becomes easier to turn the wheel again."
4,Powerful all around vacuum for the garage,"Works pretty cool sucking up lint from the dryer lint filter, sucking up stuff in the floor mats. Very loud unit, so don't expect it to be a quiet vacuum because it's not.The attachments are great but the T nozzle isn't all that great when trying to pickup my Dalmations dog hairs from the garage floor (it pushes some of it around).I also use it to clean out my bagless vacuum's container since that can be messy when dumping out. Also use it to pick up the kitty litter that's spilled out of the cat box.It does what it's supposed to do. Still waiting to use it for a wet spill and see how that works out.For the price, it's a good unit and with FREE SHIPPING you can't really go wrong."
3,LOUD LOUD LOUD: Get Some Hearing Protection,"Good shop vac for consumer duty work, but it is very loud. It is 100dB @ 6 inches, and 95 @ 3 feet (yes I have spl measuring device, I'm a paranoid dork). So you really need to wear hearing protection with this one."
4,Sennheiser PC140 Noise Cancelling Headset/Microphone,I am happy with this headset - the only problem I've encountered is the fact that they are not adjustable to different head sizes. If you have a fairly small head they are very loose fitting.
2,Uncomfortable fit,"This item was a poor fit for me. The microphone always seemed to touch my face no matter how I adjusted it. On the plus side, the in-line controls are easy to operate. I ended up returning the product."
2,The rythm guitarist should be in a professional band,"I liked the old stuff better because the guitars were heavier,all the ones i downloaded off the site were good,and i think a drum machine was used if i'm not mistaken.Cradle song,Pity none,and a few others got me goin,but then i picked up this CD thinking it would sound the same.Not the case.the guitars sound like crap,and it doesnt even sound like the same singer,but i guess it is.I think the rythm guitar player is awesome but the rest of the band it pretty boring.Anyhoot this is a weak sounding album if anyone wants the old stuff go to the website off prosthetic record.It kicks.This does not."
3,They are way better live!!,"I saw byz.play live in huntington,and they throw down hard.Best band i've seen live.I was kinda dissapointed at the lack of energy the CD had though,the music still rocks but the production sounds to tiny for them and they don't sound as enthused as they do on stage.Still good tunes here though,and not bad for a debut album,but see them live thats where they shine!!!"
2,what the??,"I went to the byzantine show in Tampa this past week and it kicked major butt.What happened on this album it sounds terrible,the drums sound flat and the singing is nothing like they did live.Just go to there shows."
1,I HATE this kind of metal,"I ordered this CD thinking it was Old school metal,there is nothing old school about it,this is NU-hardcore metal for the teenage generation.Also this band trys to hard to mimic Meshuggah(whom i hate with a passion),a freind talked me into going to one of their shows and i left after the first 2 songs.This CD is nothing but screaming and attempted singing,with a bunch of riffs just tossed together like a bad salad,and the poor sound quality didn't help either.Enough said,if you want some true metal,listen to Anthrax,Testament,or even old Metallica,because this is far from old school metal."
1,is this a joke??,"Warning,beware of clones.Yet another band that trys to sound like meshuggah,this stuff sucks.From the sample on here i really couldnt tell thought it was straight ahead thrash,boy was i wrong.Over and out,was this recorded in a garage??"
2,Selling out already???,"I remember seeing byz.back when they had a drum machine,and there music does rock,even though i'm more of a hardcore fan myself.But now it seems they are to big for they're britches,i've visited the web site that has like 100 photo's of them live and posing,what the hell is this ALREADY?!!(metallica doesnt even have all that on they're site).Being from WV myself and in a band i must say this looks like selling out to me,come back to your root's guys were you belong and help out us lowly redneck boys.Plus this album isnt as good as the ones with the Drum Machine,it lacks the energy it once had,sounds like they were tired,also I appreciate they can play and are creative,but this is just to much to soon to fast.Tone it down some guys.Later"
2,Not bad but not great either.,"These guys arent to bad,they definately have some talent,but the flat production just doesnt cut it here.Lots of off time music sounds ok,but weigh's down the album about half way through.I myself like some but not to much of this kind of ""math-music"".With a better,thicker,production and some sleeker mainstream sounding songs,these guys could actually get somewhere.Also the solo's are to jazz laden for this type of abrasive metal,they don't fit(although they are very well crafted).So as it stands this stuff is mediocre(although the riff's are really good(bout it),the album as a whole is nothing to write home about,but 2 stars for effort."
2,To confusing,"This stuff is to overboard,i can appreciate that they have talent but they need to play more straight forward stuff.Something with more of a beat behind it.Sounds a lot like that band that opened up for Tool,mashhagu or something.And they got booed off stage.This band isn't as bad though."
1,DON'T PAY MORE THAN 20 DOLLARS FOR THIS!!!,"I bought this item 5 years ago for 45 dollars on ebay, there are cameras identical to it here on amazon for as low as 16 dollars."
1,poor material,"The costume is easily broken in many places. The pants tore apart during my kid's Halloween trick and treat. The collar broke apart when my kid wore it in a classroom party. When you touch the clothes, you get black dust on your finger. Don't ruin your kids fun with this costume."
1,Outdated,"This version of Powerpoint is nearly a decade old, yet people still use it. It is nothing compared to 2010, which has a sleek interface and some amazing features. Even 2007 has better 3D functions and animations. Avoid this, get 2010, and if you still use 2003 you should upgrade."
4,Overall Good Phone,"Overall the phone functions well. It has many features and is easy to read, hold, etc. My biggest complaint is that there is no alarm clock feature. The camera is not the greatest, but it IS primarily a phone, not a digital camera."
5,Does the job!,"My 18 mo old learned to unlock the standard latch style locks so I researched till I found these. My dh installed them (it looked pretty complicated at 1st, but wasn't really hard). It's really neat and they work great. She can't get in! ADDED 7/23/10: Still have these on the cabinets, as we had another little one. I've had one lock ""stick"" so that it can't be placed in the permanently unlocked postion. Otherwise, still good. No regrets on this purchase. I have total confidence that the hazardous items that are locked behind these are safely out of my children's reach."
2,Difficult to install,"These locks were so difficult to install I returned them. To be fair I was trying to install them some drawers that were a tight fit, so it was almost impossible to drill the holes. I'm sure it would work well if you have the proper cabinets, but make sure it is easy to drill holes where you want the locks placed. They do make magnetic locks that are stick on. I plan to try those next."
2,"Good concept, too hard to install !","I had heard these locks were great and thought I would try them considering my 18 month old son can open every other type of child lock. It took me over 3 hours to install ONE LOCK. I was so close to giving up and returning them. I will not install another one that is for sure. I now have ONE cabinet that he can't get into and that is where I'll have to put all the ""un-safes"". The concept of this is GREAT and I hope the installation process and instructions can be changed so that others can actually use this product. I would not recommend unless you have A LOT of patience and time on your hands to install."
1,Not so tot loks,"I was so excite to get these locks, and that soon wore off. We have a newer home and all of our cabinets have trim or molding around the outside. Both my husband And I tried to install and get them to work. We had no such luck are cabinets were to thick but were not thick enough to use the extender. After mean attempts and many failures we returned them. Our friends also had the same problem. Be careful we almost drilled a whole through the cabinet door.I have another friend who has these in her house and they do work great for her, her cabinets are flat. Just be weary and save your receipt."
1,"JUNK, ruined $1k china cabinet, do NOT buy!","Tot Loks are junk, don't buy them! I used the drill bit markers, and the little plastic doo-hickey that's supposed to stop you from drilling through your cabinet front but still wound up cracking the cabinet front because the magnetic key is so weak I had to put the extension rod in and push it right up into the hole until it was a hair from going all the way through. It still wouldn't trigger the lock (I know it was in the right spot b/c if I pushed the lock manually, the magnetic key would ""hold"" it unlocked, it just couldn't pull the lock itself). I gave the extension rod one more nudge and it cracked the door front! Junk, junk, junk! I'm kicking myself for not giving up on it earlier!"
1,Installation is ridiculous,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child. I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work. My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss. Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects."
2,los Gavilanes Negros,"This dvd was good, maybe better, but again, if their was a story, i did not see it.the actors and actress did not played there parts, I would have like to have seen more action. luis aguilar was good, but the rest were bad"
3,club cover,"The cover has so much padding at the ""butt"" end that it doesn't want to seat properly and could come loose on the course and be lost. The original covers that I bought did not have that problem."
1,voice is incomprehensible,"I got this for my 95 year old mother who is blind and somewhat hearing impaired, to replace a similar gadget. This one had a non English speaker telling time and I couldn't even begin to understand her, let alone my Mom. We sent it back."
1,defected,I got 2 for my blind father. One didnt have battery as it should and the other sounded terrible/cant understand AND said the wrong time/mismatching time displayed. I will return them. Buy another brand/from another source.....
1,Rooster alarm talking watch,"I really like this product and will try to order it again, but the one that arrived had a battery so depleted that there was almost no voice, and the alarm didn't work."
1,Very disappointed of this product.,"the talking part of this clock is absolutely useless, can't hear what the voice say, may be the battery is low,but when you buy a brand new thing you expect the seller will put in a new battery before sending it out andyou don't expect to replace a new thing with new battery. Very disappointed, will never buy from this company."
4,one for the circuit,"Get naked, slather body with neon mud, and dance like a magalomaniac till you pass out."
2,Sounds like Matrix Rejects,"This album sounds like what was left on the floor after the Matrix Reloaded. Thanks for the cast-offs, way to make a quick buck Juno Reactor."
1,RIP OFF!!!!!!!!,"WARNING: If you already own Patton 360 and or Enterprise Battle 360 you already have what is on Battle 360 Guadalcanal. (Note Patton had NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BATTLE FOR Guadalcanal and is included with this DVD). THIS IS NOT A NEW SERIES DEDICATED TO Guadalcanal, ALL IT HAS IS PARTS OF THE OTHER BATTLE 360 SERIES. We enjoyed the others and recommend both of them. This one is nothing but a DECEPTIVE MARKETING PLOY TO RIP OFF FANS OF THE BATTLE 360 SERIES!"
3,Slow paced history,"I fell asleep viewing the first disk.I wish the History Channel would stick to the facts andproper time sequence in telling about the events of World War II.Instead of facts such as dates, weapons, tactics, equipment, rationsand leaders,we get something less than a John Wayne movie,that is edited by hacks."
1,"I agree with reviewer, Lynnette D. Harstad, that this DVD is a RIP-OFF","I agree with reviewer, Lynnette D. Harstad, that this DVD is a RIP-OFFIt's because it is just a part of Battle 360 - season one. Season one consists of 4 DVDs in one set and it is sold at around 18 dollars. Meanwhile this single DVD, about the Battle of Guadalcanal is sold at around 5 dollars. Moreover, the DVD set was released in 2008 as stated on Amazon.com while the single DVD was released in 2009!Why did History Channel release only part of Season 1 on a single disc after releasing the whole series in a set of 4 discs?In short, the content is interesting but the DVD is a waste of my money. I did not know this before buying it from Amazon. Of course, after viewing it, I could not return it. Aggg! Save your money on this one and buy the whole set of Battle 360 - season one instead."
2,only helpful for those suffering who are christian fundamentalists,"very helpful for bible believing christians who have suffered or are suffering. However, for those of us who don`t believe what the author said, that 9/11 and the Holocaust would not have happened if Adam and Eve didn`t eat an apple, its fundamentaist poppycock. As a Jew who is the child of a Holocaust survivor, and who lost his grandfather in the Holocaust, i find such simplistic trite highly offensive, and so would someone who lost someone on 9/11."

5,Good stuff,"Great stuff, even better by adding an egg and/or meat/seafood to it. Would def order this again, maybe in different flavors"
4,Toothless,"In the story Junie B built a bastion;; she's not going to let her tooth came out, but Grandpa had other plans. In other words, Grandpa uses his amity relationship with Junie B to play a trick on her tooth. Also, parents who want their children to believe in the tooth fairy may be fomented to hyperventilate when Junie B says that the tooth fairy is fake. Clearly, this may be an awkward moment. Parents have to decide if they value the story enough to continue reading the book. Yet, the story will remind parents about a halcyon-they will remember when they couldn't wait for the tooth fairy to leave them a trinket."
1,Horrible grammar and role model,"I purchased this book for my 6 year old daughter. I was unfamiliar with the series, but the title and cover caught my eye. Being in the first grade, and having just lost her two front teeth, I thought this would be a fun book for her to read. I am so glad that I read it first! The grammar is atrocious and Junie B. is, quite frankly, an annoying, disrespectful, ill-mannered brat. I do not find her to be ""real"", quirky or cute. If my daughter acted like this, I would be ashamed. This book will be going back to the store."
5,My Daughter loved it,Junie B Jones relates to how many 1st graders are feeling. We bought this book for her the same day that she lost her 2 top teeth. She has read it several times. Easy read for young kids
1,"Abysmal Language, Not Humor!","Words fall short to describe this genre of writing - not only is the language abysmal, but as a parent of young, impressionable children, I find it rather detrimental to their psyche and behaviour. If some parents find the writing ""funny"" maybe they should keep it to themselves and spare the children. There are many other saner sources of humor! For our children's sake, do not endorse these books; rather boycott them entirely. Your money will be better spent on other books!"
3,a little too much info on the tooth fairy,"My daughter loves the Junie B series. Yes her grammer isn't correct, but that is what makes it funny. Only thing I didn't like about this book was as my 6 year old was reading it she started asking questions about the tooth fairy, especially when Junie B. said it wasn't real. I would have parents preview this book before giving it to their child. I took this one away for a while."
5,Great fun for kids and adults,"As a grandmother of a 6-year old who just lost her first front tooth, I found this story to be as much fun to read as my granddaughter. We took turns reading it and she wanted to read it all over again right away. She is now reading it to Daddy and herself. Many parts left me laughing out loud (maybe not the ones she found funny). This book is really well written and tons of fun. Definitely ""Show and Tell"" material!"
4,Very Cute,"This is one of my favorite Junie B Jones books. It really addressed some of the oh so important social issues surrounding first grade and losing teeth, and worrying about how you're going to look. My first grade daughter has a loose tooth at the time we started reading it, and she really related to it well."
2,Good storyline - bad presentation,"I agree with the reviewer who had issues with the grammar used in this series of books. My first grader brought this home for a book report and I was astounded to find intentional use of improper grammar. To sum it up the book is full of baby talk - which we do not tolerate. First graders are not consistant enough with their grammar skills to be assaulted with the very language parents and teachers are trying to get them to abandon through reading. And to make matters worse, at no point in the book did anyone correct Junie's improper language. I did find the plot lines simple, believable and entertaining. However, I believe there is a better way to present the stories without losing the content and wit."
4,A great unknown album!!!,"Though this album to me is not as great as Harsh Light of Day, It ranks high as one of my favorites. Fastball keeps impressing me each album they release. Tony and Miles have got the greatest sound combination and I still compare them to Paul and John. In this album, they change the sound a little, which is good for a band to experiment. But whatever they do, they sound really good.We need to tell the world how great this band is or they might not release another album. What happened to the publicity of this album? People are into hiphop and teens now. It's time to change their thinking? This album is too good to be ignored!!"
5,a fan from the start.,"I started listening to Fastball when I was just 7-years-old. I'm 15 now and i'm still loving them.Everybody can find something they like from Fastball. Whether you like country or rock, you will like Fastball.My favorites from Keep Your Wig On are: ""Louie Louie"", ""I Get High"", ""Til I Get It Right"", and ""Falling Upstairs."" But all of the songs are great.I got the chance to see them live and for free, so my dad and I went. They were so good. The best live performers i've ever seen. They played songs from each album and a lot from Keep Your Wig On. If you ever have the chance to see them live, it's definetly worth it.I think that each of their albums gets better and better and this is definetly true with Keep Your Wig on.Fastball is awesome!"
5,Wow,"This is a great album!!!If you don't know Fastball and you want to discover them, this is the cd to buy. This the group who made ""The way"" in 1998 and they are back with this fabilous album.And now in french: C'est un album extraordinaire, si vous ne connaissez pas fastball, c'est l'album a avoir pour les connaitre. C'est ceux qui on fait ""the way' en 1998 et ils sont de retour avec cet album digne des plus grand."
5,Pure,"I loved All the Pain, and Harsh Light, but this is pure Fastball--without the grubby, pawing fingers of big producers in the mix. The group said they would do this CD exactly as they wanted to. It's not a disappointment. The band is true to its club roots--the songs are fresh but have the mix of a good production. It's got a 50/50 combo of upbeat tunes and lyrical introspection. Personally, I think a couple of them could be hit singles with the right exposure: Louie, Louie; Drifting Away; Red Light. The rest are as good or better, but need to marinate in your ears for a few days. Then, trust me, you'll be singing them in your sleep. I hope to God this is just the beginning of a new phase for the band and we can expect more releases in the future."
1,Dissappointed,It came with only one application and I expected at least two. I wanted one for home and one for work. When I bought it initally 7 years ago it came with 3 applications.
1,Thank you all,"Most of you confirmed exactly what I thought I would find. So far this year everything from Microsoft that I have tried has been a mess. Because I have been having problems with Outlook 2003 I thought it might be worthwhile to upgrade. Instead, I am off to google mail. Thanks for saving be $300 bucks."
2,Not strong enough for good clamping work,"This product is okay, works for basic items like picture frames, but isn't strong enough for any casement work. The plastic components in the handle strip out after a short amount of usage. I was disappointed with the product and had better luck using the corner pieces with some cheap tie down straps and mechanisms. I agree with the other review about the plastic just not being strong enough.Then need to make the screw and body out of something stronger."
4,"Great information, irritating style","I don't know what the editor(s) of this book were thinking in terms of the silly way sections end, and certain blanket assertions/assumptions the authors make about society; however, the basic information and research presented are fascinating and important. I wish I felt better about saying everyone should read this thought-provoking book. It would make the world a more humane place for both men and women if more people understood the points this book makes."
1,Iron? What's an iron?,I've got a newsflash for the authors....most women don't iron either. Ever hear of wash and wear?
2,If Rush Limbaugh were to write a book about gender differences....,"It's actually too bad. There was some useful information in this book. But the political statements just got to be too much after a while. I lost track of the number of times ""radical feminist"" was used.It's less a book about gender differences, and more a book about understanding men and how modern society is ruining boys and men. Those pesky ""radical feminists"" are the ones to blame.If you want a less biased view of gender differences, try ""Why Men Don't Listen and Women Can't Read Maps"" by Barbara and Allan Pease."
2,Not the best bag for your buck,"These are only good if you need a wrench that requires a tight spot for a wrench. The quailty of these wrenches is less than perfect. I had to go to a northern supply store to even exchange two sizes because they did not flex freely....Maybe the company has fixed this problem, the truth is regualar wrenches would do the same job just fine. Save your money!!!"
2,Roccoco,"I had such high hopes for this book. I am such a fan of Adrianna Trigianna's. It fell way short of her other novels. This is about a ""straight"" male Italian designer that gets excited over trim and fabric. Sorry. No such thing!!! It was just too much!"
1,"Stupid, boring, confusing -- DON'T BOTHER","Hardly up to Trigiani's usual standards, this is a book my four-year old granddaughter could have written. Save your time and money! It's AWFUL!"
2,disappointment from a great writer,"I am about half way through this novel, and very disappointed. This story is heavy on description about interior decorating, which, unless you're really into that yourself, comes out very boring. The characters don't have the depth and charm of Trigiani's previous ones, and the story doesn't seem to get anywhere. I keep waiting for it to get better. I'm just glad I got it at the library, and didn't have to buy it. Still hoping for a better novel next time..."
3,"Designerly, light hearted read","This book was definitely not as good as her other books, however, I still enjoyed it. You would have to fully appreciate design to get the most of this book. I personally remember having design problems in college that just stumped you. This book helped bring back those times and the struggle to get the best design out of yourself. This book also had a little food, love, and fun that made it enjoyable.Yes, this is a light hearted read that is not very deep but so what?? Sometimes we all need a little of that!!"
1,I realize it's fiction but.......,"...a statue - a Modigliani no less - falling out of the leg of a Fatima statue??? The ""in crowd"" depicted in the mural gaping at the Fatima miracle on the church wall??? Give me a break!Trigiani was trying to make something out of nothing with this book. Is B. gay or isn't B. gay? If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it's a duck but then the author has B. getting it on with the redhead from Scalamandre's and wanting to get it on with Eydie Von Gunn. The author might be implying that B. is bi. Who really cares and who needs this sort of ""intrigue"" anyway?The book sold like wildfire initially because her fans ran out to buy it but let's see if it will have staying power. I think not."
3,Cantone - great narrator!,"I listened to the audio version of this book and loved Mario Cantone. He did a great job with the characters. The story wasn't necessarily ""meaty"" - it was fun. There are characters that work hard and sacrifice for an end goal - and break out of shells that have spun around them.This reminded me of a good ""Lifetime"" movie. Interesting and light - that works for me. Especially between mysteries or serious books."
2,Very disappointed!,"I started with Big Stone Gap series and was hooked. From then on out, I read EVERY book this author put out and was VERY satisfied. However, when I got to this one I was almost instantly disappointed. The book was filled with pages and pages of details that only an interior designer would care about. I MADE myself finish this book. I hope that the new book by this author will be as good as her earlier ones. I HIGHLY recommend any of her other books, just not this one."
1,Bleck,"Ok, so it's set in 1970s. Maybe we can chalk the whole book up to qiana, leisure suits, and bad facial hair. But there's more than that. This is a badly told story. One reviewer described it as a book about B, who realizes that everyone in his family comes to him for help, and then realizes that the whole town loves him and will help him when he needs it. George Bailey, he's not. And the Irish Catholic painter friend is no angel Clarence. I guess the Priest is supposed to be Mr. Potter. Hey, just rent It's a Wonderful Life, and skip the wannabe.And what's with the recipes printed in the story, and the catalogue numbers of fabric B used in his decorating jobs? Do we WANT to go out and order swatches of fabric (by inventory number) of items used in 1970s decor?Don't get your hopes up on this one. I've not read the author's other work, but after this one I won't bother."
5,INTERIOR DECORATING 101,"I LOVE ITALIAN FAMILIES, ITALIAN FOOD, ITALY AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. THIS STORY IS LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY AND PARTS WILL BRING A TEAR TO YOUR EYE.I LOVE THE WAY ADRIANA TRIGIANI TELLS A STORY."
1,lack of interest,"I have loved all her books but should have known when the book cover shows her name at least 3 times larger than the name of the book that this was a bad sign. She's gone Hollywood and I think lost the knack of writing a truly interesting novel. The book is shallow, dull, pretentious. Two chapters was all I could handle. What a disappointment after the great stuff she's written in the past."
2,Disappointing,"While I don't believe a writer has to follow in his/her own footsteps and write the same type of books over and over, this departure by Adriana Trigiani is not successful.While it has the obligatory trip to Italy, it makes little or nothing of the trip and since a decorator is making the trip, I would have thought that she would have included a wealth of description here. Instead the trip is glossed over and we are treated to only those descriptions of ottomans and fabric that adorn the homes of di Crespi's New Jersey clients.The book is filled with caricatures and not characters and no New Jersey Italian stereotype is left unturned.Not much of a story and the main character is rather boring as well.If you insist on reading it, save your money and go to the library."
4,Lazy Fun,"Fun beach read- lots of giggles while you linger in the sun. For those of us who remember the 1970s, the decorating is a delight. I'm not so sure about the ""OUR LADY OF (Drown Your) SORROWS CAKE WITH HEAVENLY FROSTING,"" on pp. 63. The story line is not ""Rococo."""
5,OUTSTANDING book on CD!,"The reader of this marvelous book, Stephen Hoye, was so wonderfully entertaining! It was like going to a stage play - I hated to have the book end. I enjoyed every single minute and laughed out loud many times throughout the story. Stephen Hoye IS Bartolomeo di Crespi:)! PLEASE Ms. Trigiani - give us MORE!!"
3,A bit of a disappointment,"I came across the Big Stone Gap series by accident, absolutely loved them, and was excited to find Adriana Trigiani had several more books to her name. I read them in order and felt they got weaker with every one. I was really disappointed with Rococo; I never really liked or identified with any of the characters, I felt much of the dialogue and situations were far-fetched (but then I don't come from a big Italian family), and it had none of the insight of the Big Stone Gap series. That being said, she still writes well and is very entertaining; just don't expect it to be more of the same."
2,Disappointing Trigiani/ Annoying reader,"This is not up to Adriana Trigiani's usual storytelling standards in the first place, but the reader of the audio version makes matters even worse. When he's reading the narrator's part (a hunky straight 40-year-old interior designer) he sounds like a girl, and when he's reading any of the female parts, he sounds like Harvey Fierstein on speed. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and listened to 2 of the 4 audio CDs, but then I just could not take any more."
5,32 oz rubber mallet,The Tekton wood handle 32 oz rubber mallet was a great purchase. Priced right and just works for that little extra encouragement to make it fit.
3,Solid customer service,"Pros: pretty heavy, just right for assembling my gorilla racks.Cons: wood in handle cracked within the head, and fell off almost immediately during normal use...didn't hit the handle by accident or anything. Would look for something sturdier, perhaps fiberglass.UPDATE: Tekton contacted me almost immediately after posting the above, and promptly mailed me a replacement, no questions asked. A+ for customer service."
5,Another hit classic,"Yeah nothing but good things to say about this movie love it watch it over and over, was a great find on here for a great price"
3,Vikings Do Jazz,"A very interesting recording and certainly not disappointing. The quality of the recording does show its age - one can certainly hear it, but the music and beat are enjoyable."
2,Couldn't get past the first 100 pages,"I would provide a thorough review if I could have gotten past the first hundred pages. Alas, I could not. The tone of the book is just slightly arrogant and has an undertone of sarcasm. I didn't like it. You can have my copy if you live in the Bay Area (South Bay). I'll give it to you."
3,A coarse filter,"This appears to be a coarse filter compared to using a nylon.It states that it can be used in washing machine drain stacks, (into the drain pipe) so I'm giving it a try.Will remove and inspect after 12 washings to see how much is trapped.Will follow up with a report at that time."
5,nylon mesh lint trap,I find this product to be a very practical and use-full item and I would recommend this product to any one looking for lint traps.
5,Birthday Gift,This is something Mom specifically wanted and I'm so glad it was available for gifting. It was exactly what she wanted!
4,Uniquely Beautiful,"I got this ring for my husband for Christmas and we both love it. It runs a little big though. The design is nice and he gets compliments on it all the time. Plus, he's not really into diamonds so the small array is perfect for someone not into all the flash. I would highly suggest it. Thank you, Netaya!"
5,Everyone should read this book,"I envy the students of Law, Criminal Justice etc. who will be using Dr. Silverman's book as a text book. It is a very well written, exciting account of how the largest police departement in the world used enlightened management techiques and a sophisticated computer system to drastically reduce crime in New York City. Business students and corporate managers can benefit from reading the book as well.The Deming-like management techniques used by the NYPD would benefit any organization.This book is for anyone who wants to be well informed."
5,Very intriguing. A fascinating accouint of policing.,This account of NYPD policing shows that effective policing can make a difference in the crime rate. I enjoyed this book a great deal. It is a good read.
5,Intriguing behind the scenes account of NYPD crime fighting.,Now I can understand for the first time the actual dynamics of crime fighting; and what really drove down New York City's crime rate. The book is written in a lively manner and the non-police professional learns a great deal from it. I highly recommend it.
2,Too small for a pendant,"I owned a beautiful necklace with a pendant that was exactly like this one, only larger and very well built. My necklace was stolen and I ordered this one, thinking it was the same pendant, but it wasn't, it is very small, does not stand out."
4,Noble things,This was ok movie it was little rough for me but I think some would like it .Main got it because Michel Parks was in it .
2,Noble Things DVD,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, finding the whole thing amaturish with poor sound and visual.To tell the truth, the only reason I ordered it was to see Tracy Byrd - good thing I didn't blink orI would have missed him.However- it was priced right and delivered quicker than I expected.What ever happened to Tracy Byrd - love his songs and voice. Does anyone haveany news of him?"
1,What a load,"Wow this movie is crap Brett Moses must be the worst writer, actor, director since Ed Wood, this movie is horrid there are about a hundred unnecessary camera shots that serve only one purpose showing Brett Moses with yet another slow motion country dumb look on his face. Notice all the reviews are by other people that know this guy or where extras or attached to this movie, as a person with no connection to this steaming hot pile of a movie I would recommend not buying it, not even watching it swag online"
2,Does the job but......,"I wish I loved and could recommend this scooper but it's not practical for multiple droppings. (It's also useless for soft stools. Sorry for the gross out.) I hope the seller will clarify this in his description. If you have time to hassle with the bag to pick up one mess, then you might find this tool to your liking. Otherwise, save yourself some money and the headache."
5,it works,"it really works as promised. It takes a few minutes to figure out initally, but once you do it's very simple and there's nothing else to buy because it reuses grocery plastic bags."
1,Don't reinvent the wheel,"For someone with back problems, this product is superior only to leaving the ""foos"" on the ground. I like the idea of using plastic grocery bags, BUT, this item is only effective on single ah, deposits - and on only the most manicured of lawns. The telescoping handles are intended to fold up for convenient travel. If only. In reality, as soon as you try to pick up a foo, the handles collapse and retract, leaving you stooped, uncomfortable and wondering why you don't just have done with the ridiculous item and use your hand! Not only are these problems a serious handicap for this item, it drops the little foos instead of collecting and bagging them tidily, causing you to clumsily keep scraping and scooping at the same pile. ""Never needs cleaning"" is a fabulous sales pitch but this product needs some re-design."
2,Not Mac-native!,"I only learned after I bought this that Macintoshes require a POWERED microhone input, which if course this doesn't have. You have to buy something else, like a USB adapter, to make it work with a Mac."
4,high quality of sound. But not comfortable to wear,"I have nothing to complain about the quality of sound. But it is not comfortable, worse than my previous one, which only cost ~$7."
1,Uncomfortable!,This thing is so uncomfortable. After 20 minutes my ears hurt!This thing gives way too much pressure. Don't buy unless you like uncomfortable headphones.
4,good sound + comfort,"The first set of these headphones i got from amazon did not work, but i sent them back and the replacement was here in no time. The headphones have very good sound for this particular style. And the on cord volume control is very handy. The cord is very long and because it attaches to only one side of the headphones it does not get caught up easily which is great for using them with a computer. The think i like most though, is that the headphones are very comfortable. They are very light and do not get in the way of my glasses.They also reduce noise but do not cut you off from the rest of the world - important in many office settings. Finally even if i have them up quite loud my officemates still cannot hear them.All in all a really nice set of headphones"
2,mediocre,I used this headset mostly for skype and I was very pleased with it till the microphone died. It lasted just one year.
4,online gamers,"For the price it is great for my teenagers who are into WoW. They were very appreciative of this headset, much more so than of any other that I got for them. They break headsets all the time, but this one seems to be hanging on better than the others. The boys specific response was ""These are great! = not a lot of bass, but we don't need it."""
1,Another broken mic,"As others have written, this is a great device -- until the mic stops working. Mine lasted about 3 weeks. I'm sure it's because while I was using the device, I stood up with the volume control still clipped to my pants, damaging the device. I didn't knock it that hard or anything, and one would hope that such a device would be a little more rugged, but it's not. So if you're very careful and don't fidget too much, you should be fine, but I think you're better off getting a device less prone to breakage."
2,Sound quality is great but terribly uncomfortable,"These headphones sound beautiful but the headpiece is not adjustable at all. It just squeezes onto your head like an alien claw leaving your ears in pain if you wear them for more than a half an hour.The microphone also seems to produce good quality sound, but the swivel adjustment on it doesn't hold well so it constantly keeps falling away from my mouth.Lastly, the foam ear-piece covers are cheap and kept falling off, after two years I have lost them completely. This makes wearing the headphones that much more painful, so as you might imagine, I don't wear them much at all anymore.If you are going to shell out this much for a headset, make sure it is a comfortable one."
4,worker bee,"I bought this headset for voice recognition and it seems to work fine. I'm an online grad student with lots of papers to write, I really should have purchased this months ago and saved a lot of keyboarding.I have a large head, and it feels fine, I can't tell I even have it on most of the time.If there is any complaint against the unit it would be that when listening to music- the bass is garbled, even at low volumes in some songs. I use sonique with a 20 band graphics equalizer and minimized the lowest bandwith, which seems to help, but soundwise I have heard much better headphones. No matter my major reason for buying this headset was voice recognition, which it does well."
5,Bought as a gift was LOVED,This item was bought as a gift for a friend who plays online games (such as BF 2) and he loved it.He and his friends had a couple nights of 'gaming' and all took turns - not one complaints among them.Most all stated that this was better than 'even some of the more expensive pairs'.Am pleased with the product. Only had an issue with the delivery method - was shipped DHL and DHL turned it over to the Post Office for delivery. I live in a rural area and never saw the package after the PO received it.Amazon did great and resent a new package out to me - THANKS AMAZON!!
2,Adequate at Best,"This vac is noisy, so wear ear protection when using. Power cord is too short. It is attached to the motor/blower which sits atop the unit. If you place the motor/blower in a position so that the cord is facing away from you, the blower directs the air back at you during vacuuming.Not as much suction as you might imagine. The ""anti-tip"" design is a misnomer. The wands are too short, causing you to have to bend over while vacuuming the floor.The blower seems to work better that the vacuum.All in all, look for another unit. Don't get stuck like me."
5,great condition,this was a great buy and the product is really im pretty good shape considering it is used. I use these to give to the inmates at the county jail. Its always something that blesses them tremendously.
5,Thumbs up!,"Explanations, answers to common questions, and Scriptural links make this Bible a great one for a newer Christian or anyone curious about Christianity"
5,Great Study Guid - Simple English,This bible has by far kept me interested in the bible. As you read it has questions along the sides that normal people would ask. Other bibles get too wordy and could lose you if you like simple reads.I would surely recommend this book to anyone.
3,"""Beginners' Bible""? - Qualified!",It is great if you want to hear prepared answers on a range of a simple topics. So you can easily start with this one. But... it gives you no chance to grow... Studying Scriptures deeply will cause the need of another study source like Thompson Chain-Regerence or smth. else. Do not limit yourself!
4,A Bible that has an encylopedia worth of information.,"I purchased this bible when I was renewing the study of my Christian faith. The text is easy to understand, although not as poetic as the King James Bible. The chief benefit are the margin notes. The margin notes give short paragraph explanation on topics such as Leprosy in Biblicial times to Should Christians fast. The scripture links are helpful finding references. A great bible in my opinion for personal and group Bible studies."
4,Good Collection of Techno/Trance,"I listen to this album at the gym a lot. It has a nice flow, from beginning to end. To me the best songs are ""I Count On You"", ""Spürst Du's Nicht!"", and ""Victory of the Heart"" (a song I describe as a Friendship Anthem) :)"
4,A Great Summer Album,"Sniff is a quirky, fun, sweet and innocent blend of 80's pop/light jazz/bossa nova. But here's the catch--TLJRG doesn't play pop well, they don't play jazz well, and they don't play bossa nova well; but somehow...it works! Picture the Go Betweens giving Jonathan Richman a ride to a party at Astrud Gilberto's house. Definitely worth a listen."
4,"Alot of empathy, no concrete solutions","The interviews in this book were very enlightening, giving me some new insights into the situations that I, and apparently many others, are going through with aging parents. I did sympathise with many of the adults, and I guess the only shortcoming of the book was that I expected it to provide me with solutions. I realize that may be impossible to receive from a book, but I do think I gained a lot by the empathy I felt to others who deal with the same insolvable and sometimes intolerable situations. I would recommmend this book to those just beginning to feel the pull to help their parents so that some strategies may be of help in the earliest stages before patterns are set."
1,Continues to send the wrong product!,I ordered this item and received two large and two small drip pans. So I asked for a replacement. They sent the same two large and two small drip pans. So then I asked for a refund. They refunded minus the ridiculous $8.99 shipping charge. Waste of time and money. Do not order this product until they say they have the right product in stock.
3,No real way to tell what they fit.,"As other reviewers stated, the small drip pans fit my stove and the large did not. I knew it was chancy but, after research got me no answers, ordered this anyway. The large pan was too big by about 1/8"" or more. My solution was that I took it with me to a Sears store and looked for a large pan that was slightly smaller. What I got was a GE PartsMaster 8"" drip bowl, PM32113. It fits perfectly and the label states "" fits most brands EXCEPT GE and Hotpoint."" So I have to assume that if you have those brands, it would be a good idea to check out this set. I also found that the GE product is a little bit thicker metal than these, which doesn't bother me but it's good to know there is a difference in optional quality. Now my real challenge will be keeping these clean! The old ones came with the house we bought."
2,Sizing Issue for Older Kenmore Stove,"I have an older Kenmore electric stove. The 8-inch drip pan does not fit: slightly too large; can't sit in place on center. Also, this larger drip pan arrived bent--no protective packing material in box. The 6-inch drip pans are fine and meet my expectations."
2,Wrong for my Whirlpool stove,"The drip pans did not fit snugly in my Whirlpool stovetop, which makes the burners sit at a funny angle. The larger one also arrived bent."
4,May need minor modification for some Hotpoint stoves,"Minor modification (bending) needed to work on Hotpoint RB525. The pans are just a tad shallow for the element insert. Best deal around for a clean stove, tho. Happy customer! Thank you!"
2,Deceptive advertising,Amazon the issue of the picture being wrong has been mentioned for over a year. Very deceptive and irritating. Master Magnetics if you are listening this is giving you a bad name.
5,Magnet,Good strong magnet that will hold up well. I placed a 1/4 inch bolt through the center hole and used it to mount items in a storage container.
1,Worse than a B movie!,"This movie was a waste of 1 hour and 30 minutes of my life. I can not even tell you how bad it is. It is not even about ghosts really. A couple stay at a hotel, the writer gets drunk, moves to L.A. and leaves his girlfriends, who ends up getting sick and fired from her job. Thats the story. Along with the end where some ghost goes inside the girl. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY BUYING OR RENTING THIS MOVIE. YOU WILL TRULY REGRET IT IF YOU RENT THIS."
1,"If it had a Plot, you could bury it.","Poor Acting, poor Direction and poor continuity, trail you through some of the worst dialogue, and inept script I've seen in years. In the ""The Off Season"", everything is off including the season.My wife and I watched it and laughed through all the whole thing. One scene comes to mind. Inside the motel room you can see it's pouring rain and the male lead goes outside and there's no rain in sight, but, you can still hear the pouring rain. He goes back into the room and the rain is back. Priceless.My True Rating is 0 Stars. Rotten Movie."
3,Worth a rent,"I really enjoy indepedent horror films that try to break away from the common cenceptions of modern ghost stories. While almost succesful in doing this ""The Off Season"" falls a little short. When watching low-budget films I can usually forgive bad acting, but Don Wood is terrible. His performance is so distracting that it's a welcome relief whe his character leaves the story. While this film definitely has it's moments, the pacing tends to slow the action of the story to much and looses your attention from time to time. Worth a rent but if you're thinking about buying it you might want to leave this one on the shelf."
1,implausible,the young couple come to maine and rent a room in motel. the first room shown them the bathroom is covered in FECES... but they stay anyway and are given another room. the wife disovers a big bloodstain in the bed and doesn't wish to upset her husband so she quickly covers it with a sheet and lays down.i mean....really!! IMPLAUSIBLE
1,Boring,"Very slow, boring movie. It's more about the couple's relationship than anything else. Low budget is obvious and bad acting. The landlord couldn't even get her lines out right. Film appeared to be low quality.Movie just sucked. It seems Lions Gate has many horror titles like this and they are all horrible. At least there wasn't a five minute lesbian scene in this one (see Slaughterhouse Massacre)Rent to make fun of with friends, otherwise,avoid."
1,Don't EVER EVER waste you money on this piece of crap!,"Calling this movie a ""piece of crap"" is probably a gross understatement and if I could give it 0 stars I would. I bought this movie for $2 in a bargain bin and I overpaid and want my money back it's THAT BAD. If you are an avid horror film buff, you will HATE this movie. The ONLY thing you can possibly enjoy with this movie is if you MST3K it throughout the entire thing and entertain yourselves. Otherwise, don't bother. However, even then, you may be disappointed."
1,THE OFF SEASON IS OFFULL!!,"Somewhere in this muddled script there may be a story but you can't prove it by me. Dull pacing. Horrible script, acting and direction and an underlying electronic score that simply drives one batty. THE OFF SEASON offers nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before and a hundred times better. What a drag!"
2,2 good things,"I only rented this move to see Angus Scrimm in action. I could barely stay awake during this film. Half the time the movie is showing people moving around in a motel room, deciding when to clean something up. I give it 2 starts, one for Angus Scrimm and one star for the effort, I respect people just getting out there making horror movies, good or bad."
2,"Worth one rental, but that's it.","I'm giving this one two stars - but one of those stars is for POTENTIAL. Not that the same team could do it better, but it actually seems to me that this one would actually make for a good Hollywood film (if rewritten and recast). OK - I know that sounds like a whole new movie. But, actually, this one does actually have some good moments. And the acting, in parts, is amateurish enough that is almost seems believable. As far as an OTS (off the shelf, as in video store) horror flick, this one wasn't as terrible as some of the reviewers might lead you to believe, at least in my opinion.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for..."
2,"Not all that good, not all that spooky","This movie looked reasonably promising--until I put the dvd into the player. Even before the movie began, I began to suspect that the movie was lower budget than I had expected, and it only took less than a minute of the actual movie to confirm this. I decided to watch the movie anyway, not having much else to do, and in the end can't say that I was all that spooked, let alone entertained. The whole concept and structure of the movie isn't all that bad, but the script, acting (for the most part), and the production leave much to be desired. Needless to say, in watching the equally low-quality ""making of"" featurette, I had to laugh when they harped on the fact that the number of people involved was actually quite small. As if one couldn't tell!"
2,Dont waste your money,Alot of things in this movie dont make sense. i didnt like this movie at all its not creepy scary or nothing and dont understand why the boyfriend wont tell his gilr he is seeing ghosts just gets up and leaves and as for the women with all these going on why does the wmen stay in this room.the movie is not worth more than $10 if you want a good gost movie get the amityville horror the old ones or something like the shining or poltergeist.Buy something worth the money and this isnt it.
5,"Intimate, insightful, a MUST read - The Wysard","As an avid fantasy reader, I have read books by many authors. Few have the technical skill and rich depths of prose found in the Wysard. This book reveals a world filled with striking cultures and offers insights into the characters that are not often seen in this genre. The main character Ryel is surrounded by a building sexual tension that changes his role in the world as he discovers the machinations of the malevolent Dagar. From intensely intimate scenes between Ryel and Edris, to Michael's stark cruelty, this book was crafted with word by word care and it shows. I eagerly await part 2 of the Wysard and highly recommend this first book in the Wysard series."
2,A Romance Fantasy,"I am going to be honest. I did not enjoy reading this book. I can only compare it to a literary version of a daytime soap. The characters were flat, insincere and unbelievable. I couldn't connect to any of the characters in the story because they all are so un-lifelike. The fight and combat scenes are thin and scarcely described and the magic is even worse. The characters all fall instantly and irrevocably in love. The ""good"" characters are all beautiful in every way while the ""evil"" ones are ugly. My caveat to readers, if you are looking for a fantasy novel along the lines of Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind or Melanie Rawn then this is not the book for you. However, if you are looking for a harlequin style romance fantasy novel, then this is just right."
5,Wyzard,"Wyzard is a delightful journey into a very real fantasy world. The author's voice is clear and beguiling, and obviously enchanted with the histories of her characters. I was transported and disappointed to come to the end of the book. I hope there will be a sequel."
1,A true one percenter,"In that I didn't make it past the 1% mark. Stilted writing with a convoluted info dump that glazed my eyes like a doughnut, couldn't delete this one from my Kindle library fast enough."
3,A fresh take on a well used theme.,I think this author is going to go places. She's got her own voice and even though I've read similar stories to this one her take was fresh and interesting. Basically this story is about this young boy turned wysard and his quest to free his mentor's soul from a curse. It's a fun story full of high adventure and intrigue. Definitely worth your time.
5,Great story,"I downloaded this book to my Kindle, after reading a review on RedAdept's blog. What a wonderful story! I am halfway and I cannot wait to read Kephart's other books. Great addition to the world of fantasy. Please keep writing."
2,get what you pay for,"these blades are thin and frail, they do cut just not very fast. I wouldn't attempt to use these on any stone or hard brick, they wont cut the mustard. to be expected though for the money."
3,Works okay for the price,"I used it to trim up a handful of slate tiles that were sticking out a little too much. I used it dry cut and it worked fine. As some other reviewers mentioned, the arbor hole isn't quite 5/8"" so I had to clean it up a bit with a round file."
2,get what you pay for...,We use a lot of different blades and loved the price on this one so we decided to check it out. Compared to Bosch and Dewalt similarily priced blades this one went out of commission 75% sooner. If you are working on ceramic tile for a very small project this is the blade for you but if you are wanting less blade changes and smoother cuts... pay a little more and get quality... you get more money for your worth that way
1,Breaks tile into little chunks,Like I said - Breaks tile into little chunks. Chips at every single cut... Cant use this blade. Basically worthless.
5,german Dance Pop and wonderful ballads,"This is the last Rosenberg album with wonderful Dance Songs like ""Wieder da"" written and produced by ATC/U 96-Alex Christensen or the house song ""Gift""! I Like this album very much, the cristal voice of Marianne is fantastic!!!"
1,A Candy Coated World of Make Believe,"Madonna, who now has read and written children books said it best when she said, ""I read a lot of children books and really they're about nothing. They teach children to think little and be pretty, and they rarely teach a moral lesson."" This book is in the former category. It's a candy coated treatment of the world, and quite unengaging and limited in both scope and content. Have your children read Grimm's fairytales or else Aesop's Fables. At least in those pages they will learn something of value. It certainly beats this brain dead literature."
3,Good reference book,This has been a good book to keep on our shelves so we can quickly pinpoint the biographies of the major characters of the Bible.
2,Watch band is junk.,"After wearing this new watch a few days, I find that the band keeps snagging and pulling the hairs on my arm. An inspection of the band shows a very poor quality of workmanship. For a watch of this price, I am saddened that Seiko would put a band like this on the watch. Seiko's customer service Dept. tells me that Amazon.com is not an authorized seller of Seiko watches."
4,Nice watch..,It's lovely but lighter in person then it appears on here. It's on it's way back because my husband wanted a darker one.. But it's a nice watch.. Decently priced...
4,canyons,"This is not your ordinary werewolf book. Using the tabloid papers as focal point for the heroine, the author presents a number of twists and turns that are quite believable. Her characters are well-developed, especially Cat Moselle. Though I found parts of the book a little too graphic for my taste, overall it delivered a satisfying read. From the ending I assume there will be more books about Cat to come."
2,disappointing,"I expected more from this book, but it ended up feeling like just another horror paperback (for which I paid a hardcover price). The tabloid headlines were cute for a while, but there wasn't much depth, and the twist at the end was both dark and disappointingly cliche. The book left me both depressed and uninterested in what would happen next. The convention of using italics and capitals to refer to gender/family relations when speaking from a werewolf's point of view was stylistically annoying and distracting, to boot. I'm generally a fan of werewolf books, and eager to go along with whatever the new spin on the mythology is, but this just wasn't fun."
2,No Good and Disappointing.,"I gave this book a two, because it really is good if you don't like ""Happily-Ever-After"" It has good ideas, but it has a bad ending. It was REALLY good until the last few chapters. Like I said Bad ending. The girl doesn't get the guy or wolf as the case is.Ghost Wolf"
5,canyons,"I was given canyons as a gift from a friend , I found it it wonderfull, a get away from the typical format of the typical wolves or wearwolfe story. and I read more than the norm.....once you get past the the first sec . for Ill say its slow it get realy good.....mel from wash"
2,Disappointing & predictable.,"After checking out the reviews here at amazon.com, I thought I'd be in for a good read. Unfortunately, I was wrong. The plot wasn't that original: Girl gets saved by werewolf, girl falls ""in love,"" girl is stupid and is eventually in need of being saved again, etc. This usually doesn't bother me, but the predictibility of it all made it seem dull. The ending was especially disappointing. I guess I'm just a sucker for ""happy endings,"" or at least semi-happy endings, but this left me unsatisfied and bored. It wasn't that bad of a book, I just expected more."
2,Weak!,"Whilst still in the thin plastic blister pack I placed it against a steel shelf - it slid down.I took it out of the packet and it stuck, but wouldn't hold more than a couple of pounds.I have rare earth magnets 1/16 the size of this that hold much more. Save your money.Made in china."
4,Uneven Gateway to a Great Lady,"As usual with tribute albums, the contributions of some acts are suburb, but most make you want to hear Wanda's originals. If all this compilation does is introduce this national treasure to a few more fans then it has served a noble purpose."
1,"poor graphics, poor game play","This is one of the worst N64 titles I have seen. The Paperboy looks like a fat stick figure. You cannot control the bicycle well at all. You are restricted to viewing only one side of a poorly drawn street at a time, which is frustrating. Hitting the targets is only involves a little timing, not real skill. In ten minutes I was bored."
1,PaperBoy,This game couldn't keep my interest. I played it for about an hour before I was completely bord with it. There was too much repetition of tasks and not enough changing sceens.
3,Meh,"It was ok. Son, who loves old school gaming wanted this. Works good, but he wants to do a bad game review on it."
4,good,i think this game is good and is a regular game for those who arent looking for blood splattering games with no heads i recomend this for 7 to 15 will like this
2,K.J. Wenzel,"The music is an interesting collection of early tangos. However, the sound quality is horrible. It appears that the recordings were transferred to a disc without any effort to enhance the sound or bring it closer to modern standards. For someone interested in Pedro Maffia, or in collecting historic recordings, this may be a necessary purchase. Otherwise, I cannot recommend it."
1,Let the buyer beware!,"Unspeakably awful! There's very little of Bettie, and a great, great deal of excruciatingly cornball late-'50s style variety ""entertainment"" that you might imagine might be cute and endearing but most emphatically is not. You'd have to be a great deal hornier than I was to find Lily St. Cyr's strip tease arousing, and the only notable musical performer is a woman with an extraordinarily huge head. If you've never trusted another review in your life, trust this one: you might as well throw the money away."
5,ANOTHER GREAT TIME CAPSULE.....,"More delightful Bettie Page in a variety of teasy routines and charming ""come-ons"". You can see why she is a cult item now. There was no one like her. The rest of this DVD is devoted to corny routines with the exception of the notorious Lili St.Cyr---a legendary stripper of the time. She is beautiful and her vignettes are classy and professional. She, like Page, was also a favorite of photographers---most notably Bernard of Hollywood. This is a must for nostalgia buffs and a rare look at what used to be called ""burlesque""."
3,Bettie Page Fans Only!,The only saving grace of this video is the dance performed by the beautiful and sexy Bettie Page. It is worth purchasing for this alone but after you've seen Bettie there is virtually nothing else worth viewing.
5,"Good price, worked great",I bought this cable to transfer data from one laptop to another. Worked great. Good price too.
4,Good but not great,Got this for my girlfriend she says it's great in every way but one the loop on the back is huge so it doesn't lay flat it always lays one way or the other excellent quality just not quite perfect.
3,not 100% happy,"It's a smart, attractive watch, but the hour and minute hands are a little difficult to see on a similar colored background."
5,Very nice for price,"I recieved this just 4 days after ordering,very fast ship! This set is very nice for the price..Would order it again.Great bargain !!!"
5,happy with purchase,I recently purchased this game for my son he was very happy and I was more happy with the price!
5,No slow romance here,"Catherine Bellamy has just made the mistake of her life. As a courier for the Sons of Liberty she is taking the place of her brother for this one night. Big mistake. Little does she know that this is a setup, and she is captured with one of the most wanted men in the colonies. Merlin aka Lord Blackmoor, a captain in His Majesty's Navy, is trying to find the person or persons who are responsible for his brother's death. He smells something rotton in Yorktown and it isn't the bilge from his ship. There are some really bad guys that he and Catherine must find. Julian Lambert, Lord Blackmoor, is one of the most compelling heroes I have seen in a long time. Catherine is strong, no wimp here as she gives as good as she gets. They make for a wonderful pair as they battle forces that will see them captured or dead. This book also had a great humor element that I found a lot of fun, which made this book a nonstop thrilling read."
3,A multi-faceted plot.,"Catherine Bellamy finds her deception unmasked when she takes her brother's place at an exchange of information during the pre - Revolution days of the colonies. Worse than Merlin, the agent with whom she meets, the British find them and arrest them for treason, with hanging the penalty.They escape, and think never to see one another again, but when Catherine entreats her brother in law, an English nobleman for help in her impoverished circumstances, he recognizes her as the woman he met while disguised as the mysterious Merlin. What's worse is that he finds himself attracted to his brother's widow.*** A complex web of deception and secret identities make this novel at times confusing. Julian, the hero, is often brusque and though sexy, hard to find endearing. Though Catherine has fire and spunk, even in put upon conditions, the multi faceted plot does not allow for enough character development to truly warm up to her. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore."
5,My kids love this game!,"I have a son who is 9 and a daughter who is 6 years old. They both enjoy playing this game. The playing pieces are wonderful- the characters and images are right from the book (by Maurice Sendak). There are so many possible combinations of creating a puzzle maze that it's almost like having a new game everytime. The kids really like choosing their own pieces, especially the character images. The pieces are all very colorful and made from good quality cardboard. This game is a MUST for anyone who knows and enjoys the book."
5,The Low-Fi Sound Of New Zealand,"Strange as it may seem, some of the hippest music in the world comes from New Zealand and The Clean started it all. This is their most assured album with lazy melodies and quirky lyrics (""Mickey Mouse ate a vanilla shoe"" from the song Franz Kafka at the Zoo). A distant cousin to the Velvet Underground. Vastly under appreciated in the U.S.."
3,Weak point is not the screen,"I own this monitor for 11 months.I must say that the image (color&contrast;) on this monitor is excelent,but the weak point of this monitor is the stand (supporting-arm)!After 6-7 months arm could not support the screen weight and dropped considerably making it useless. I have placed cardboard box between screen and bottom base.It is definetively faulty design. One can check for itself on the web that many buyers faced this before 1 (one) year of usage.Screen itself can not be detached from the arm. Ergo mount on the wall is not possible. And also base is quite big takeing a lot of space.Actually it is too bad that such a great display has such a basic fault."
2,Defective Stand Design,"The monitor looks good, but after a few months the stand was unable to hold the monitor up. The stand design is flawed."
3,"Great Screen, Weak Arm","I love the image quality of this screen, but it has developed the same trouble staying above desk level that other users have reported. A few months after I installed it, the arm stopped being able to hold it up, and I have had to resort to jamming a squishy rubber ball into the joint of the arm, just to keep it a little bit above desk level. Also, I can also confirm that the software included with the screen has many problems - I had to uninstall it as well. Get the next model!"
1,Fundamentally flawed design - do not buy!,"As many others in cyberspace who bought this monitor have noted, the fundamentally flawed design of this monitor means that the monitor sags because the hinge design cannot support its weight. While it looks good, and I have no problems with the speed or brightness of the display, the fact that Samsung made such a bad design when it comes to the way the monitor is supposed to work really irks me, especially since I paid a premium for the looks and am now resigned to propping up the monitor with a book. Do not buy this monitor! Get one that is better designed."
4,Works well with Heath Zenith 174C-A 4 inch bell,"My wife's parents are both extremely hard of hearing and never heard their old ""ding-dong"" door chime. I bought this transformer and the doorbell that goes with it. Wired them up for the 16 volt output, I didn't measure the actual voltage produced, but the decibel level of the sound was adequate, so everyone is satisfied. Probably built in some third-world country, but everything is these days."
5,Great book!,I received this book when I was a little girl...way back when it was written. My original copy is much loved and I wanted to continue to be able to share it with my children and grandchildren. I am so glad it is still in print.
2,Just okay,I bought this book for my then 4 year old son. He didn't really like it and I found it a bit boring as well.
5,Favorite book for 30 years!,"This book was loved by my son and now by his daughter. It is a classic and should be enjoyed by all. It is a simple and great story for many age groups. Just imagine a town making a huge, huge jam sandwich in order to get rid of the hornets! The visual images are wonderful."
5,Nothing better than a jam sandwich!,I got this book at our local library book sale. It quickly became a bedtime favorite due to its rhythm and rhyme. A truly small-town problem with a truly small-town solution. What a delight! The best 25 cents I ever spent!
2,One of the worst attempts at poetry I have ever seen,"It's a novel story idea, but the rhyming is some of the worst I've ever seen. The grammer is atrocious. Judge for yourself:They drove the picnickers away,They chased the farmers from their hay,They stung Lord Swell in his fat bald pate,They dived and hummed and buzzed and ate,And the noisy, nasty nuisance grewTil the villagers cried, ""What can we do?""Ugh."
5,Giant Jam Sandwich,"I grew up with this book and am rapt that amazon could find it for me.I love the simplicity of the book, the story, pictures etc.I am now able to read it to my children."
4,childhood favorite,"This was a favorite of mine as a child, so I was excited when my daughter was the right age to read it. She enjoys it immensely and loves to point out and name all the details in the colorful pictures."
5,Childhood Memories.,"THE GIANT JAM SANDWICH was one of my favorite illustrated stories when I was a kid. I remember in first and second grade listening to this story at story time in the library. This book was one of those rare books that every kid in the class sat still for because we loved it so much and didn't want to miss one word or not be able to see one of the pictures. The story is rather simple; basically a town is over run by wasps and in order to get rid of the pesky insects, they build a giant jam sandwich. However, the original rhyming pattern adds a touch of flare to the story. Also, the illustrations are a pure joy to look at. This is a great book that most children will enjoy. But be forewarned, it's a book kids might want you to read over and over and over again."
5,A Childhood Favorite,"This book was one of my absolute favorites as a child. The rhyming verse makes it very fun to read aloud. The story is just fascinating to young children. I'll have to buy a new copy to replace the tattered one from my childhood! I was very relieved to find that it was still in print, it really is a wonderful children's book."
5,Very cute story!,"This is nice for my students who struggle with reading. I let them read along with the Audio CD twice, then I ask them to read it by themselves. They love it,"
5,My favorite book from childhood...I literally have it memorized from so many readings to my kids,"I literally have this book memorized. I could recite it right now without missing a word because I've read it SO. MANY. TIMES. to my kids. It was my favorite book as a kid, and when my mother-in-law gave me a copy that belonged to my husband when he was a boy, I was thrilled. This book never gets old. My kids love it, and so do I. You know how some books are difficult to read aloud? You know how the rhymes aren't quite right, and the meter is off? Well, not this book. It can be read aloud with ease. The cadence is perfect...the words fall just fall into place. Plus, the story is truly entertaining for an imaginative child. The drawings are a bit dated (it was the 70s, after all) but they're still hilarious and get everyone giggling. Truly a classic!"
5,I remember reading this with my grandma.,This is a very fun book to read to your kids. I remember checking it out from the library with my grandma back in the mid 80's. I was so excited to find it on AMZ. Now my daughter loves to read it too.
4,Great Book for children,This is a funny story about a familiar subject that is delightful to read with children. It's very whimsical and the pictures are funny too.
5,Great Book,This a replica of my husbands fav book as a child. Our son already loves the book ad we've only read it to him for the last two weeks.
5,Wonderful pictures and delightful tale,This is an excellent bedtime story to read to your children. The art work is fascinating and each time the book is read a new facet can be discovered. The townspeople in the story band together to rid the town of stinging insects. A delightful solution is found. My children begged for this story to be read to them again and again. Guaranteed to become a family favorite.
1,Don't bother,"This is a book that I read to my son many years ago. He loved the story and it was a favorite for both of us.Because it broght back so many good memories, I bought a new copy for my grandson and gave it to him for Christmas. When we sat down to read the story, we discovered that the pages were out of order and some were even upside down. This item will be returned."
5,Great book!,Such a cute story from the 1970's. It's a good one to have in your children's library. Thank you! !
4,My son loved it,"This story was a wonderful one. I am glad I bought the book for my son. He is a child that doesn't like to read much, but he loved reading this book and looking at all the wonderful pictures that are in the book. If your children like Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or Pickles to Pittsburgh, I think your kids will love this book as much as my son did."
4,Good Native American Set,My 6 year old son in enjoying this set. Only slight negative is the head band with feather for the little boy does not stay on well.
5,A Great Place to Start Reading Yoder; A Must Read,"This is the book that helped me try to start following Jesus again, helped me to believe in God again, and helped give me the courage and inspiration to suggest the idea of a Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship.I can without doubt say that this book has tremendously influenced my life and I am grateful for the biblical, theological, and Jesus centered approach that Yoder provides."
4,Great 50's tab color shirt,Came on time and looks and fits great. All you need is some Aqua Velva after shave and your back in the 50's
4,tasty - hope it works,"bought the benecol chews to try to bring down my overall cholesterol level. i'm not real clear about how many to eat per day - between 2 and 4 with meals is what i've been doing so far. they are quite tasty although they tend to leave a cardboard type residue on the roof of my mouth, but it will be all worth it if my numbers come down. i'll let you know in july when i go back for my annual checkup."
5,Benecol Smart Chews,"I bought this product thinking that it couldn't hurt to try it. My doctor had recently told me that my LDL cholesterol was high. After only two months of using it, my LDL cholesterol dropped by 40 points. I no longer have to consider a statin drug. I have been telling everyone I know to buy it!"
4,tastes good,these chewables are delicious. Do not know about the results of lowering cholesterol...I will have to wait until the next Dr. exam. yum
5,Taste great!,These are sort of like a treat during your meal. Since you are supposed to eat them during your meal! Kinda fun and they taste great! Do they work? Well see in 3 months!
