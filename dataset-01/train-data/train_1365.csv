3,Amazing,"This album is like no other so called ""teen pop""..heartfelt lyrics and an amazing voice....Plastico and Imperfect are the best!Does anyone have the lyrics to ""Imperfect"" ? If so, please post or email stwisdom@hotmail.com"
4,Guaranteed WORTH your ATTENTION for Spanish rock lovers,"My friend had this album playing in her car, and right from the start I got into ""Plastico"" and ""Lagrimas."" After buying it, I loved ""Tanto,"" ""Tatuaje,"" and ""Tan Cerca."" Then I REALLY loved and kept playing ""Piscis"" over and over and over again!!!! (Piscis is my absolutely fav of her songs.) Her Outkast cover of ""Hey Ya"" is amazing and I like to pretend I can sing it. To be honest I never got into ""Ingredientes,"" ""10 mil,"" ""Dime,"" and ""Not Healthy,"" but the others are sooooooo absolutely fabulous that I have to give it 4 stars. Please check this album--you will not be disappointed!!"
2,So very disappointing,"I bought this CD along with Bebe's Pafuera Telarana and this one sucked SO bad in comparison. I bought it because of the positive reviews i read here and im sorry to say they that were very misleading.Basically I don't recommend this CD, but that isn't to say you won't like it!"
4,Understanding American Football,"Fantastic book for someone who yearns to understand the game, and America's obsession with it. The author explains all details (from uniform requirements through offensive plays) without being condesending. I've watched football my entire life, not really understanding a thing - this book definitely helps me watch (and enjoy!) the game."
3,think and slippery,"these socks are warm. but they are so thick, my toddler can't put a shoe over it, even though the shoe is a size up. and they are not non-skid. i had to take them off right after i took his shoes off. it can be fixed with dimensional puffy paint tho. i painted several raws of circles on them and not they are non-skid"
2,Misleading Prices,"I don't appreciate how they say the price starts at 7.99 but then when you check all the prices they start at 8.99 or so. It's misleading as you think you could find a deal but you can't. It may be a great product, but if they can't deliver on price - I don't want to order them in the first place."
5,Great Socks!,These socks fit my 2 1/2 year old and are very good in our weather right now! They stay up and no complaints about cold tooties in the house or out and about so far!
5,Great for young boys,My preschooler and kindergartener love these socks to keep their feet nice and warm. Not too bulky and can easily be worn with sneakers or boots. Good quality.
4,Super warm but shrink a bit,"Smartwools are the very best for our cold winters. I get the kids a couple pair every season & they pass down the others. So far, after three seasons, we have yet to get any holes in these. They are warm and comfortable. Order a size bigger as they do seem to shrink a bit in the dryer."
4,Good product but pretty thick sock,these are great - very warm etc - but they are thick so keep it in mind if you have a tight fitting pair of boots shoes
4,Saddle up,"I thought that this was one of the better values available for the money. As expected it compliments the car's interior better than cheaper seat covers. Use caution during installation. The stiffener, which wedges down in between the seat back and seat, wanted to tear out."
4,Hank Eugene,"If you are looking for a quick and fun read then Dead City is an excellent choice. Readers of Shane Stevens might find this one lacking the depth of his other stories, but the raw and explosive writing is still there. He brings you inside the organized crime racket, and delivers an action packed page turner. As with most of his writing this book is not for the faint of heart, with blunt in your face details involving all wheels of the maffia machine. Dead City is a NC-17 version of the movie Goodfellas, with charactors that tug at your emotions. My largest complaint would be with the ending of the book. It seems to end a bit suddenly; and leaves you wanting more, which is a common problem for even the best writers. If there was a sequel, this would be far less of an issue. Good read!"
3,Shane Stevens DEAD CITY...,"Newark. A city of wealth and power. Also a city run by the mob syndicate. Smuggling, extortion, loyalty, and double-crosses are the law and only the smartest and strongest are left standing. A very realistic crime story with stunning detail and insight into organized crime. However, DEAD CITY lacks cohesiveness and contains a few stereotypical mobsters which contribute to keeping it an average read. DEAD CITY is still worth reading for the gritty, realistic language of Stevens..."
4,Good for a few laughs,"Was very pleasantly surprised and had quite a few laughs. More chuckling than LOL moments but overall, very refreshing to see this comic."
2,I did not like this viedo,I did not like the video. The video was very bad. I could not understand what she was saying. Bad video
2,fairly nice,"didn't like it much, it's all about go out and see different people, alot of writings and less things to teach you ""how to's"", to me it's not the right book on how to draw from your imagination. one simple thing to do is ""keep on drawing ALOT, draw every position either you like or don't like, then you'll draw without a model"" but you have to learn the foundations."
1,blade is not up to par,"i expected more from this blade . it does not cut true ,it leave saw marks and it does not mate to the cut piece. i do not know if the blade is bent or the design.but i am very dissapointed"
4,Good inexpensive blade,"The stock Makita blade in my Makita miter saw finally went dull and I replaced it with this 10"" DeWalt blade. I haven't used it long enough for an acurate evaluation but it has been cutting very nicely through Red Oak and verticle grain Douglas fir and Hemlock. This blade has made for some very clean joints on window trim and counters."
5,Considered by most to be a CLASSIC FINGERSTYLE CD!,"Klugh hit a high note with his fellow solo guitarists when he released this Classic recording. Along with Charlie Byrd, Joe Pass and a select few, he has defined solo fingerstyle guitar.For another look at this material on solo guitar, seeAcoustic Standards - Volume 1andAcoustic Standards - Volume 2by Rick Kuncicky, an amazing fingerstyle/classical guitarist with a wide range of influences from Chet Atkins & Charlie Byrd to Earl Klugh & Guy Van Duser, but with a fresh style that's all his own."
1,Bogas hit piece,"This was intended to be an Alinsky style hit piece on a conservative publisher ahead of New Hampshire's first in the nation Presidential primary elections in 1976. The whole effort was amateurish and unnecessary. It had little affect on Loeb at the time, but it now seems to serve as a historical text for the likes of Wikipedia authors."
2,Other models more effective,"While it will certainly ""get the job done,"" I found this model less effective than the (I believe) panasonic unit I had which has a circular blade that spins rather than this straight blade that goes back and forth. This one is cheap, but I would go with the panasonic."
3,"Ok I use it, but it could be better.","Interesting device with two drawbacks which are sensory driven. One is that when you use it in your ear it is quite noisy. I wouldn't want to lose my hearing just to trim a little ear hair. Useable but loud. Using in the nose, it smells of light machine oil (or 3 in 1 oil) even after a year of use. Again, usable but could be better. As for actual cutting, it is pretty good but areas need to be repeated before being completely removed. Hmmm, a nose hair trimmer with an odor, and an ear hair trimmer that's too loud. Is there a better product out there on these two issues?"
1,ear hair expert,"I bought this Conair unit for the car (!)-(yup!) because I am a wreck in the mornings, and often forget to use my ""old reliable"" Panasonic one at home after shaving!...Moral of this story: this Conair thing ain't even worth the cheap price. It is loud, and doesn't cut close. Like giving your ear hairs a crew cut."
5,Maybe the cheapest and surely the best,"I've bought seven or eight trimmers, including a couple that were in the $30 range and almost all looked better and more serious than this little dude.But this works the best of all and is the most versatile. It's quick, light, does its job and just about jumps back into the drawer and smiles at you.And the cheapo slider on/off switch? Doesn't turn itself on inside a toilet kit the way several others have. And yeah, it does eyebrows, sideburns, ears, noses. Sorry, no windows."
3,Just what you need...,"Ladies, if ever you've been distracted by unsightly nasal hairs protruding from a loved one's nose, this is the product to buy, and your problems will be solved.Added uses... Tired of plucking your eyebrows? This dandy little trimmer works a treat for tidying up your eyebrows too.But wait! I haven't fully investigated the hygene angle of this additional use, so perhaps you'd better order two, to be on the safe side."
2,Not worth it.,"It may be cheap, but it really doesn't do the job. It's vibrations make it uncomfortable for nose use. The size of th contraption is really too large, and you can't take it traveling if you want to save space. Note that it is pretty good for trimming hair above your ears between haircuts."
2,fair at best,"Nose and ear hair--a subject we have to deal with, win, lose or draw.This one from Conair, does take effort. While I have never experienced any discomfort from using it, nevertheless it does not trim close. I guess that's to avoid injury lawsuits.On the positive: does not tug like the circular-type machines, which can also cause a histamine release (sneezing).On the negative side: strong burning odor emanating from the device.For under ten bucks, it represents decent value. For close-ness, the micro-trim was superior, if they're still around and you can deal with all the up-sell attempts by their tele-marketers.Also, if still available, the Sharper Image made a trimmer at $59 that was very good. And, at that price, it should be."
1,"Can't give it a 0, worthless",We should be able to rate products as a 0!!!! This would suffice for this product. It is worthless! Does cut anything!! Can't get anything. Worthless. The blades move fast and sounds like it's doing something but you'll quickly notice it's just noise from this item!
1,Don't waste your evening with this one!,I grew up loving George Segal and Glenda Jackson but this movie disappoints. It just isn't funny!
1,deservedly obscure,"Vulgar and witless, this movie may be a primary reason that neither George nor Glenda has an acting career anymore. L&F felt dated and empty in '79; the passage of time ain't helped. If you have any taste at all, you will HATE this movie!!! So they get to dance with their legs in casts --well, la-de-da!"
2,"A frustrating book to get through, don't bother","this book was a waste of time, I only finished it because I hate starting books and not finishing them, and I own it (for now). The main character, Allie, is an Arabian princess trying to avoid her future marriage to some older man. She manages to dupe those around her into letting her stay (until the ruse is up) on Cord's ranch as his house keeper.She has no housekeeping skills (though she does pick up a few in masterful fashion--suuuure) and has him wrapped around her finger in less than a second. There was no point to me reading this book, there was a complete lack of give and take and the characters were very flat. I was unable to remember the hero's name half the times (especially with his neighbor, Cade). Also I was more interested in the clear budding romance and set up for the next book in the series, between Allie's brother and Cord's sister."
3,Flimsy. The picture lies.,"These cookie cutters are made of very thin and flimsy metal, which bends easily. Also, the connection where the two ends meet is GLUED as opposed to welded together, so it comes undone easily. When I opened the box, one cutter was undone, and one was bent out of shape. Be careful how you store them, because they can get bent very easily.Another disappointing thing is that the pictures on the box or online have a lot more detail in the shape than the cutters actually have! The real things are much simpler, and require a lot of imagination to figure out what they are. I don't care so much about the shapes - those are just cookies, after all - but at least don't lie to me with pretty pictures which don't correspond to the real product!Material and shape quality aside, I liked the price and variety of (intended) shapes that these cutters have."
2,ok but not good,They are not very sturdy and some of the shapes are just weird and really unrecognizable. For the prize it's ok though I suppose
1,"Be aware, the angel is different than what is in the picture","Since I have most of the shapes but not the angel (which I cannot find it anywhere), I ordered this product. But the one I received is a SIDE view of the angel, which is not what I want. The product picture here shows an angel with FRONT view, i.e. with two wings sticking out. So, sadly, I have to return it."
4,Only wanted the gingerbread man,"Yes it is true. I bought this set only for the gingerbread man. I thought I might use the others at some point. I still might. I like the set, but they are small. Some of the shapes leave you saying, ""what is that supposed to be?"". All in all, this is a great set and I would purchase again."
4,Good Product,Found the product easy to use and clean. I would recommend it to others. It was a nice set. It was a gift
1,Rusted after second cleaning,"I see that here, on Amazon, there are washing instructions: ""Hand wash in hot, soapy water; rinse and dry."" However, I received these cookie cutters as a gift, and there are no washing instructions on the packaging, so I had to guess. I did hand wash them, but I made the mistake of leaving them on my drying rack to dry. About a half an hour later, I returned to find them badly rusted! I only got to use them once, so I am really disappointed.They did work well for the one batch of cookies I got to make with them. I just wish I could have gotten more use out of them. I agree with some of the other reviewers who have mentioned that some of the shapes are difficult to discern, but most of them make my two year old son happy enough."
2,Flimsy and rusts/stains after washing.,"I just got done using these cutters for only the second time. After washing them and letting them dry on a towel, the metal has begun to rust/stain. I personally think most of these cookie cutters are a bit too small for cookies (some only a couple inches tall) and the metal is extremely flimsy and the cutters bend out of shape easily. I definitely wouldn't recommend."
4,Decent base set for holidays,"I really only wanted a couple of these, but the Wilton website was sold out of two of the individual cutters I wanted - so I checked on Amazon and low and behold the 18 piece set had what I needed. I am sure I can find uses for the others in the future."
2,Christmas cutters,"I received this expecting exactly what was pictured on this site only to be disappointed because what is suppose to be an angel doesn't even look like one, its not the shape pictured here or anything close. The cutters seem sturdy and it arrived quickly. if the angel isn't a big factor for you then you'd love the set but I'm still very disappointed!"
3,Flimsy,"Not sturdy at all. Difficult to get back into the container they come in. They didn't last too many holiday seasons. Would be good if they are staying in a house and not traveling with students. Probably a good ""starter"" kit for someone."
3,"Good Bag, but...","Definitely a sturdy bag, I purchased this to carry my 15.4"" Macbook Pro, which fits perfectly. The compartments are well laid out and I can fit a small notebook, charger, wireless mouse, and small external harddrive. The bag itself is pretty heavy, and the straps are uncomfortable when you throw it over your shoulder.The most annoying thing, is the red dye inside the bag rubs off onto anything in the bag. Luckily the lining by the computer is nylon and not the dyed suede. I now have a slightly pink hue to all of my white Apple accessories. Not cute."
4,Works for what I need - great looking too!,"I got this as a Christmas gift last year - and I love it! It fits my Macbook, the cords and the few folders I have to bring too and from work. I really like the professional style - although I took the cell phone case off immediately. That was a little stuck in the 90's. I got the model with the red felt in the inside, which is a really great accent to the bag. But my only complaint is the red has rubbed off on my white Macbook and cord. It's not really bad - just on the corners and where the cord was folded. I'd recommend that color lining for someone with a dark computer. All in all, I'd buy this manufacturer again."
5,Love It!,"I ordered the Monaco with pink stitching because I wanted something cute and durable, that could easily double as a handbag when I'm carrying my laptop. This is perfect! I was so pleased when it arrived! the packaging was nice and the product is great! There is plenty of room inside the pretty pink lined interior for my laptop, files, cords, my wallet, my make-up bag & more! I was a little concerned that the outer shell might look cheap, but you can't even tell it's microfiber without inspecting it. It looks great! I'll follow-up with another review once I've taken it to work. :)"
3,"A good study guide, but.......","I purchased this book for a friend as a graduation gift from the academy. It is very useful for study, especially with the CD. However, it not suited for field use as it is the size of a regular text book. I certainly recommend it however, purchasing an additional pocket guide for the street is a must."
3,Not what it appears to be,"While there is good information in this book, do NOT be fooled. It does NOT come with a CD that includes the scenarios that you need to properly use the book. I purchased it 3 separate times thinking that perhaps it was just a mistake. I contacted Amazon each time and they did refund my money, but sheesh. I really WANT this CD but can't seem to find it anywhere and it definitely doesn't come with this book even though you see the little CD in the top right of the photo of the cover."
3,very good for what I needed,Found what I was looking for and hopefully will be able to make a quilt with the ideas I got.
3,I've heard that before but never seen that before.,"Okay he's a great guitar player, and their are thousands that can play as good. But get a gimmick and your in. Like I say great guitar player in a chicken bucket amd mask. If you want something substantially better check out malmsteen,vai, especilly satriani or hell maybe eddie van halen and dime bag darrell. Im sorry I buy his greatness but the only difference is a mask and bucket of chicken."
4,"Very nice stands, I got two, one had a bit of a flaw...","The Giottos stands are great and are perfect for my needs. I trust it at around 9 feet with a 24x36 softbox no problem. Thats about the heaviest load I'll put on it and I do that without weights, although I probably shouldn't. The only issue I had was one of the stands has a messed up center column tightener. If I turn it too far it skips back to the loose position, but it hasn't caused a problem yet, I don't think it will. I likely could send it back for a new one, but I'm really not that bothered by it."
5,A Must for Any Drawing Teacher!!!,"I have been teaching art in schools and privately for over 5 years. I had understood most of the principles in this book, however, if I would have had them all organized like they are in this book, I could have saved ALOT of time and energy!!! I found this book a MUST for everyone who not only teaches art, but who draws period. A great accomplishment!"
4,Great introduction to Jet Li,"This is one of his classics and the newest actor to portray Wong Fei Hong (classical Chinese folk hero).The action is great, although some parts of this movie can be quite boring. I would watch this movie just to see one kick that Jet Li executes (without being suspended on wires) in which he does a 540 degree split kick jumping from one bench to another during the opera fight scene (nicely jazzed up with a jet's ""whoosh"" sound effect).However, if you want to see Jet's true fighting talent without the cheesy Chinese element (which usually involves lots of wire suspension), see ""Fist of Legend"" - Jet's new and improved version of Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection"". I also highly recommend ""Tai-chi Master"" which also features Michelle Yeoh in top form (Bond girl from ""Tomorrow Never Dies"")."
3,"Good movie, but the DVD is mixed bag / oddity","For a DVD, as some have mentioned, the video quality is quite poor (I watched it in ""Bob"" filter which helped a little) and sound is also in mono. However, this is true if you are happening to be watching the SUBTITLED version of the DVD. For some odd reason, the makers of this DVD thought it was a good move to have a DUBBED version on different section on the same DVD. And, this is really strange because once I chose the DUBBED version in the menu, the video quality was A WHOLE LOT better and crisp and the dubbed sound was in stereo. Why they would not allow me to hear the cantonese/subtitled audio with this video track I'll never know (I prefer subtitles). Either way, if you're mostly just looking at the action and things, check out the dubbed section which has better video quality. If you like the movie with some drama and subtitles, click on the subtitled version (though video quality is not as good). -_-"
4,Jet Li Trilogy,"Part 1 is probably necessary background in this tilogy starring Jet Li, however Part 2 is my favorite and next Part 3 because of the wonderful performances of Max Mok. Max is more of an actor than kung fu artist, however, he brings the needed comedy to the film as Foon and in Part 3 he is called Ah Foon. Max is brilliant and at times outshines Jet Li with his performances. Sadly in Part 3 Max's performance and scenes are scaled down in order to bring the focus back to Jet Li. Whether or not this is Tsui Hark's idea or Jet Li is not clear, however, Max has done many other fine films. Rosamund Kwan, lovely as always and a fine actress appears even after Jet Li is no longer the star in following Tsui Hark Once Upon a Time films."
5,Jet Li rocks,"This movie is great all around classic movie. Everything was good in this movie the music,acting,story,and the over the top fighting scenes! My favorite fights are the two duels between Jet and the villian talk about over the top genius from Yuen Woo Ping and Tsui Hark! I just wish that Yuen Biao had a bigger role in the movie and I wish he would have fought more too. But other than that this movie is just too great to pass up!"
1,Very poor video quality,This video copy of this movie was one of the worst I have ever purchased. The DVD would play for about a minute then freeze up. I could not enjoy the movie. After complaining about the poor quality of the movie I was granted a refund but still lost out on the shipping cost. The movie is listed as Language English but the copy that I rceieve was in Mandarin or chinese. Very dissapointing.
5,"Great fight scenes, many styles","If you can get past the subtitles, you will enjoy the fight scenes! Jet Li is awesome!"
2,Mediocre plot with truly awful dubbing,"I am a fan of Jet Li and of martial arts films in general. That being said, I wonder how this movie developed such a reputation. The storytelling is practically absent, and is particularly difficult to follow when the dialogue is so terribly dubbed. The fight scenes are adequate, but poorly edited. Overall, this film is hardly worth renting, let alone buying.The Legend of Fong Sai-Yuk movies are infinitely better (and funnier). Unfortunately, it seems difficult to find undubbed versions of these as well. Is it that hard for people to read subtitles?"
2,not so good,Even if this movie is one of the best Jet Li's movie I think the quality of this DVD is not good enough as the sound is only Mono and the picture quality seems to come from an enhanced VCD. Colors seem to have the same defects than a Panasonic MPEG video and the sound is so bad that it doesn't keep you near the movie. Action is not soo good as it was. For such quality please buy a VHS.
2,Disappointing,"1 star for the displays of Jet Li's impressive skills. 1 star for some really evocative scenic shots. Other than that, this movie is a disappointment.The story jumps all over the place. Characters are introduced, developed, and dropped from the story seemingly at random. You can piece together what is going on, but it's painful. This isn't to say that the story isn't good, it's that the storyTELLING is terrible. A ham-fisted, amateurish attempt at movie making. Bruce Lee's ""Fists of Fury"" (as an example) is a superior movie simply for managing to present its plot in a half-way coherent manner, and it's so much older.If all you care about is the Kung Fu action, this movie has it in spades. If you are at all concerned with what holds the fights together, you may want to rent this before you buy it."
4,Chinese legend... played by a Chinese legend,"this is one of Jet Li's first staring role and the role that made him an icon of Chinese cinema. This has some great fight sequences and raised the bar for every martial artist movie that followed. Jet plays Wong Fei-Hong who is revered as one of the most powerful icons of the this era in China. He is the Chinese Wyatt Earp and is beloved in china. Many movies have been made featuring this martial artist legend ( and featuring Wong Fei-Hong father) This is also the beginning of a huge martial arts franchise, the panicle is Part 2 where Li fights Kung Fu legend Donnie Yen. this is a must for your martial arts movie collection and serves as the beginning of many great film by Jet Li."
4,Don't watch the dubbed version,"Feeling lazy and not wanting to read subtitles, I opted for the dubbed version when I watched this. At first I found it odd that this was a ""special feature"" and not just an audio track, but I later found out why. When the movie was over, I noticed that the time elapsed didn't match up with the time listed on the box. Turns out the dubbed version had over 30 minutes cut from it. I started watching the Mandarin version to see if I really missed anything, and found that a large part of the opening sequence that sets up a lot of the movie was within those lost 30 minutes. The movie itself was wonderful, and I fully intend to rewatch the full version. I just thought I should warn others before they make the same mistake I did."
2,"Great film, bad DVD.","The quality of this release is pretty poor for such a classic (four or five star) HK film. Visually, it may be the worst release of this film anywhere in the world. And then they saddle it with a Ric Meyers ""commentary"" sealing the deal that no one should be buying this. If you want to learn little more than incorrect info about a film, listen to this one."
4,A good beginning to a saga,"Once Upon a Time in China is a great introduction to the series. It is an introduction to the main characters and the story line. Jet Li stars as The peaceful medicine Wong. His skills are known in the Mainland area. The story talks of how peace is the ultimate goal, but sometimes we all must fight a war to find the other side where peace lays. The fighting scenes are well done and though sometimes have a bit of randomness, believe me, there is a plot. The semi-negative portrayel of American's can be equaled to the portrayal of Russians in James Bond Films... Definitely a must buy along with the other films in the series."
3,"eh, seen better","the cinematography is pretty excellent in this movie with great color and back drops. but the actual fighting was disappointing and for 2hrs, few and far between. ""Fist of Legend"" is a much better action movie. BTW, although it says widescreen it is not 16:9. it's 4:3 aspect ratio but letterbox style."
2,A silly mess,"Alright, I'll confess to a slight infatuation with Jet Li, but even that did not make this movie more than passable. The plot is all over the place. It barely made sense - characters would suddenly arrive, locations would develop and then nothing would come of them. The bad guys were just silly - I like real malice and evil in my badies, I like to hate them and enjoy their come uppance. Well the silly twisted bad boy was just pathetic, and Jet Li, ever serene, was so far above the whole mess, so detached and lovely, just going through a very routine job of being Jet Li. The evil imperialist Yankees plotting to capture unsuspecting Chinese immigrants and enslave them were cartoon cuts outs.Like every other enthusiast of this genre I enjoy the carefully choreographed fights and they were good, but not good enough to redeem this film. Give me Kung Fu Hustle any time - now there is quality!"
2,Tsui Hark's masterpiece?,"After reading several reviews for the movie, I was compelled to see what the hype was all about. Unfortunately, what others may perceive as Hark's masterpiece epic, I only see as a mediocre film. It seems as if Hark couldn't focus what he wanted the film to be. He took stabs at action, adventure, comedy, and romance, but unfortunatly failed to do a quality job on any of those aspects.If you're an action junkie and looking for a Jet Li martial arts flick, you better turn elsewhere. The few interesting fights are done well, but the film relies on a historical plot as it's backbone. For me, the storyline was sleep-inducing, but I suppose it depends on personal preference.Yuen Biao's comedic performance, and the battle during the end keep this movie above a 1-star rating. Admittingly, I'm not a big fan of Hark, but I'm no detractor of his either. This movie just failed to inspire any interest out of this disappointed viewer."
2,Keep looking. This is not a movie you want.,"I've seen several martial arts movies. I used to wince at wire work, but flying monks plays a part in old mythology.Jet is always a draw for me, but what a let down this is.The camera work is poor, the characters are beyond sterotype, the fight scenes are okay, but just okay.If you really need to see this movie... rent it."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I have recently become interested in chinese history, and have taken to seeing movies that may (even loosely) be based on chinese history. Martial arts is merely an extra benefit. After reading many good reviews on this film I wanted to buy it, but only the Mandarin 5.1 version. The cost, however, led me to rent it first. Thankfuly, I did! While it was the dubbed version, and not the original Mandarin, this was still just a very bad movie. The martial arts lacked, the acting was poor, and it seemed to me to just show the chinese in a rather poor light. I recommend The Emporer and the Assassin and definetly Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Save your money and just rent this one..."
1,Maybe next time that could make a movie with more politics.,"I found this movie to be the most boring and completly political. It isn't a movie at all, it is nothing short of propaganda and not even particully clever. The plot is weak, the acting atrocious. Even Jet Li whose martial arts prowess is pretty amazing does hardly anything. The movie does justice to no one. It makes every non-chinese appear evil and it makes the Chinese look easily lead and stupid. Which isn't the case. For being considered a Hong Kong classic I was very dissappointed. There are many other Jet Li films out there that are far better than this one. Black mask still being my favorite. If you want good action look to other Jet Li films, Jacki Chan or Chow Fat."
5,A Classic!,"This is THE BEST a movie can ever get! The acting is perfect, the story is wonderful, and the action scenes are so good. This DVD is very recent so the picture quality is a lot better than the original release. The english dubbed version is kinda gay though. This movie is so famous in China, that all you have to do is whistle its music and any EDUCATED chinese dude would recognize it. This movie isn't only about martial arts though. It has a very good plot, with several sad and touching scenes. You'll like this movie more if you understand chinese and english (Trust ME). I wish Jet Li was like this in all of his movies."
5,Awesome fight scenes make this a must have for kung fu fans,"The first in a series of films about China's legendary Wong Fei Hong, played by Jet Li. Directed by Tsui Hark (China's Steven Spielberg), movie has excellent fight scenes.An essential movie for any kung fu fan."
5,Once Upon a Time in China #1,An Incredible kung fu movie! I recommend it to all martial arts lovers and fans of Jet Li. If one admires good kung fu fighting and interesting plot - this is it! This and the rest 2 parts of the trilogy are the best movies that Jet Li has done! I love it!
1,Once Upon A Time In China,"The reason I got this movie is because it received good reviews. After watching, I was very disappointed. If you'd paid close attention, Jet Li didn't perform much of the fighting sequences. It's some stunt guy doing all the fighting. Li only posed for the camera when the action had passed.Stick to Jackie Chan movies. He does all his own fighting."
5,Best hair product for guys,"Gives you great hold, but without the stiffness of a gel. It works great for wavy or curly hair. Unsure about straight or fine hair."
4,Hair wax,"Great product if you want to keep that ""wet"" look without any stiffness that other gels cause once they dry. A little goes a long way also."
5,Redken Products,"I've always used and liked Redkin products. The Body Full Shampoo and Conditioner is just as good as the rest of them. If you've used Redkin in the past, then you already know you have a good product. If you've never tried using Redkin, pick any product and you should be happy. I've never had a bad Redkin product."
2,Doesn't fulfill expectations,"Concisely put, the product has no hold, nor does it ever dry. It does have a high amount of shine, but that is about the only quality it offers. Given the high price of the product, one would expect it to perform well in some area, but it truly is nothing remarkable in any category I found after 2 weeks of use. Save your money on this one."
5,Best Value ever!,"This book arrived extremely quick - I think within 3 days of placing the order. This book is essential for anyone who is a newly diagnosed diabetic, caregiver to someone with diabetes or works with those who are newly diagnosed. Simply, easy to read and follow. An excellent value for only $5.00"
3,Only for photographic editing,"In A Snap is *totally* about manipulating photographic images. If you want to learn PSP basics, pass this up. I have used Paint Shop Pro 3 and am totally confused by version 8. I bought this book and Paint Shop Pro 8 Fast & Easy by Diane Koers because even the basics were confusing me, e.g., selecting a font to put on a blank background.Obviously, I am not qualified to give a detailed review of In A Snap, but if you want to learn editing of photographic images, you probably want this book. For basics such as creating buttons and banners for websites, check out Koers' book."
3,uninspiring,"The book covers many of PSP's photo editing options, but is rather uninspiring in it's examples: too many family pictures and not enough color examples."
5,Gemini,A well written story and character development in keeping with previous novels by this author
5,Studying for your exams??? Buy this book!,Work and understand all of the problems in this book and you will pass your Physics Ph.D. qualifying exam in Mechanics. I did it!
3,Local product,"This is the big brother of ""Deserts"", containing some more pages and treating species that grow bigger. See review there."
4,Works Well.,"Bought two. Both worked well, but required some blowing to achieve a comfortable sleeping mat. Overall, very happy."
2,Not recommended,I bought this mat as a less expensive alternative to a Therm-a-rest sleeping pad. That was a mistake! I used it twice before the seam on one side came unglued. I repaired the seam at the leak but then additional leaks started at different locations in the seam. I guess if I would've re-glued the entire seam it might have been okay. If Wenger would use better glue on the seams this would be a decent pad because its nice and thick. It was comfortable when it didnt leak. I now have a Therm-a-rest that I've used several times and its still holding strong. I would not recommend the Wenger Self-inflating Mat. Spend the extra few bucks initially and get a Therm-a-rest.
2,Two and a half stars...,"The ""self-inflating"" title is a little misleading... especially when the instructions suggests that you blow ""extra puffs"" for a firmer feel. The pillow part was great, but the actual body required more than a few ""puffs"" to get it to a decent thickness.We used this mat 6 times in a week. Each morning, we would attempt to squeeze out the air, but we were never able to roll it back up to the size (or close) it was when it arrived. No wonder why the securing straps were so long..."
3,"OK, one was broken","Bought 3 mats, one of them had holes on the side (the glue was not strong enough?)."
4,No stiff back from sleeping on the ground anymore...Very nice mat,Great mat to sleep on while camping and my girlfriend thought so also after taking a nap on it so I had to get another one because I wasn't going go sleep on the el' cheap-o mat she had.Wish the mat was wider but everything else was great and the air never deflated during the night and I'm a 250 lb guy.*When you first get the mat inflate it before your trip because it takes awhile (1 hour for me) but after the first time it's pretty quick like 10-20 mins depending on how firm you like it.
5,excellent fragrance,"excellent fragrance, buy and is very good, the smell stays for a long time and I can guarantee it is original, I recommend this product."
2,Asleep at the wheel,"EMI took a big risk having Haitink conduct a complete Ring since he had never conducted Wagner in the opera house. He turned out to be disappointing all around, with no special insights and a tendency to underplay the most famous orchestral moments. We can mercifully skip over his adequate-to-dismal cast, as even this budget CD of excerpts barely manages to catch them in good form. Only the Barenboim set has worse singers, and that's debatable."
1,Worst Ring I've heard in years,"This is the worst recording of music from the Ring that I've heard in years. The singing is terrible, and the orchestral playing is boring and ugly. This is definitely the Ring to avoid. If you want some highlights, try a sampler of one of the more successful recordings of the Ring: Karajan, Solti, or Bohm. There are plenty of samplers out there from these recordings, any of which would be more musical and more exciting than this.Try Karajan if you want beautiful and thrilling music, Solti if you want to test your car stereo, and Bohm if you like the excitement of a live recording. The latter two of these three are less in tune than the Karajan, but there is some thrilling singing on the Solti set - particularly the incredible Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson."
2,Limitations,"Mr. Appice's book has certainly been around for a long time has been used by many teachers (including myself). The biggest drawback of this book is the choice to layout the exercises in a format where each instrument has it's own line rather than using a traditional five line staff. The probelems are these:1) While the initial exercises are fairly easy to read, later in the book when the toms begin to be incorporated it actually becomes more confusing than traditional notation would be.2) The use of a non standard staff reinforces the notion that percussion instruments are not to be taken seriously, and that drummers don't really need to learn to read.3) Someone who begins in this book with no prior experience will have a hard time moving to other texts which do use traditional notation.4) Someone with previous experience and with properly taught reading skills tend to find the non-standard format annoying if not confusing."
5,This is the one!,"For teaching drumset, this is the method I love. The book teaches reading and counting by way of many different beats/grooves in simple 1 and 2 measure phrases. If you do the different variations for each beat as described in the front of the book your coordination will go through the roof!I still like to use Haskell Harr for rudimental teaching. Using them both together gives students the best of both worlds.I highly recommend this book. (And for the younger students, get the one written for younger kids).The only negative thing about this book is that they didn't make each exercise a seperate CD track so some of them are hard to locate. If they did that, it would be perfect!"
5,Ultimate Realistic Rock Drum Method,This is a must have book for serious drummers who want to improve. The exercises are challenging but yet fun. Many of them can be incorporated into fills. The CD's and DVD are very well done.
4,very good beginner/expert book,"It is a good book which contains beginner lessons, and lessons for experts. Although it is not the same book as in the picture that is shown for this item. Overall good book and good shipping!"
5,Great classic book that teaches everything to be a great rock drummer!,I bought this book for a drum student of mine since every great drummer of the last 30 yrs has gone through it. I highly recommend the book for any drum teacher teaching good old rock drumming to students.
3,It had no DVD as promised in the package,"I purchased this with Amazon via Forever Drumming. It arrived with no DVD, after I complained about it I got a reimbursment of $17.00. Forver Drumming told me it never came with a DVD. If this was true, then howcome it's advertised with one?I went to the Carmine Appice website & sent them an email about it. They said it definately should come with a DVD.Apart from that it's a pretty cool book & CD I can't talk about the DVD.I wish I had purchased it with Amazon, it's the last time I'm going to try & save a few dollars by buying it at the cheaper price or ""Available from these Sellers"" links on the Amazon website. I'll just purchase it from Amazon in future."
3,"It works, with flaws","This unit definitely gives off oxygen-enriched air, rated by the manufacturer at 40%. Blow the air on a candle and it will glow very bright. Breathe the air, and it gives a nice mind-clearing feeling. Air flow rate is very good. I usually directed the air away from my face a little bit to avoid getting too much oxygen.The bad: it has loud horribly-annoying beeping sounds when you turn it on and then set the timer. And then when your session has ended, it annoyingly beeps 5 times. If you were relaxed, that just killed it.The product listing is very misleading. It shows pictures of extra items but none of them are included. Not even a nasal cannula. The head set / mouth piece, which is the only thing that is included, is annoying and loud. All those other extra items? Ridiculously overpriced on 02's website.Bottom line: it was fun to play with for a couple weeks but ultimately I sent it back."
4,More worth it than you think.,"I have suffered for years with ADD and anxiety. I've been prescribed medication for it. This has led me to overeat, not stay on task. This oxygen machine has given me more fulfillment than the medication. I feel more in shape, energetic, and focused. And so far it's been pretty reliable.While I agree with the above reviewer who says that they don't include everything in this order, the company does have a website that allows you to order whatever you want. It'd be nice if they told you at the beginning. But they also have a number to call with issues. They haven't responded to any emails of mine though. The only reason it doesn't get five stars is the company's issues.In conclusion, Im not a doctor, so listen to the doctor before me. Your results may be completely different from mine. But if your looking for a solution to issues that may be both physical and mental.......I think you'll find this to be enjoyable and beneficial."
2,My dog won't use it,"My dog refuses to use this! Not saying it's bad quality, seems good, but I guess my dog either doesn't understand or have any interest in this thing. I will be giving it to someone else and hope they have more luck with it"
5,Very happy/,I'm very happy with this. My dogs and kids get a lot of use out of it. I will be buying a second one soon.
4,Nice,This product is really nice. It's bigger than I thought I would get for the price. My dog loves it. The only complaint I have is that I have to tighten the screws everyonce in a while. But I have an 75 lb dog that walks on it.
4,Great bed but the fabric was too loose. Had to get a replacement.,"I ordered this bed from Amazon thinking it would be the perfect bed for our very hot natured furry Corgi. A lot of the reviews mentioned how tight the fabric was and how that made it difficult to assemble. Mine was easy as can be, but once my dog got on the bed I realized that it had way too much slack and was not supporting him well. It was like he was sleeping in a hammock. I called the Coolaroo manufacturer and they said it was definitely not supposed to fit like that and to send it back for a replacement. Thankfully Amazon has an easy return policy. I'm waiting on the new bed and hoping it is a tighter fit and will give my elderly dog the support he needs while also offering him a cool place to sleep rather than our hard tile floor (which he loves). This bed seems like the perfect answer for his needs, if I can get the poorly fitting fabric problem resolved. Waiting."
5,"The dog has spoken, prefers it over the kurunda","I have a six year old German Shepherd, who had a coolaroo dog bed for five years. It got shabby and I decided to replace it, and I bought the top of the line Kurunda dog bed. Tried the Kurunda for a year or so (thinking even if it were a bit different, eventually the dog would get used to the Kurunda) but she would not use it. Apparently the Kurunda is just not as comfortable to her as the coolaroo. So I gave the expensive Kurunda to our local animal shelter, and bought a new coolaroo. The dog has spoken, five minutes after putting it up, she is lounging on her cot."
5,Saint loves it!,The bed arrived soon shipping was great. The instructions were not very helpful as there is a trick to setting it up. A review on here is was helped me figure it out. Before i was even done setting it up my Saint Bernard was already laying on it. I had to brive her with food so she could get off. Finally i finshed it and she couldnt wait she slept all night in it and is laying on it now. My 3 year old is jealous and wants one too. lol I bought this because she is always panting her crate gets warm and so does her bed so i bought this assuming it would help her stay cool. Since the fabric has holes it ventilates and never gets warm. She loves it and if she is happy i am happy too!
4,My Dogs Love This Bed,"I bought two of these for our golden retrievers. I placed one inside the house (in our bedroom where they sleep at night) and one outside. Even though they are polite about sharing them, at night when I say, ""Time to go to bed,"" they clearly rush to the bedroom door to position themselves for first choice on the Coolaroo. Inside, I like how the raised bed separates the dog hair, dander and odor from the carpet. It is easier to clean the bedding than the carpet, and this keeps the room smelling fresher. The plastic cover feels a little harsh for my older arthritic dog, so I have a thin cushion on top. Outside, the Coolaroo works exactly as it says. I wish the cover could be made of something other than the plastic mesh, but I do appreciate that it requires a simple hosing off to clean. It certainly is a cooler option to laying on the ground, and I don't think my dogs care what it is made of. Glad I bought them and I would recommend them."
4,Dog bed,"This product seems fairly well built and pretty sturdy. It wasn't the easiest thing to put together alone, but I managed. It seems to be able to hold our dogs' weight well, even when they are both rough-housing on it. The only probably I've encountered is that my dogs have yet to use it for what it's for...hopefully they'll learn."
4,I can see how the fabric would rip easily but so far so good,"[...]-----Anyhow, that was alittle strange. Other than that, so far so good. I agreed that trouble chewers might have a hay day with this one, but our two dogs were not so they only lay in them. To protect the fabric we took two large beach towels and layed them over the top, yes it will not let as much air circulate to keep them cool but they will last linger. If you bought them for the purpose we did which was to have an easy to clean bed that keeps them off the hard ground just cover the fabric, maybe in a permanent way as I probable will, like a sheet with some rough sewing skills on the bottom. The large is perfect for our med. large dogs. i had my 190 pound husband sit in one and looked underneath and it was not on the floor. It will give after awhile but unless you have a very very heavey dog i don;t picture it going all the way to the floor."
3,Coolaroo Pet Bed - Not a Hit!,"I recently purchased a size small Coolaroo pet bed for my miniature schnauzer. Thought it would be perfect since he is always seeking out cool places to sleep - especially during the summer. Although I think it is a great product, well made and very portable, my dog disagrees. He will lay in it for a short time when I coax him up, then quickly exits and lays elsewhere, usually in a spot that looks far less comfortable. May be a bit small for him (20 pounds), as he tends to splay out his legs when sleeping during warmer weather."
5,SUPPORTS THE FLUFFY PRINCESS,"First off, the Coolaroo is very easy to assemble! Once I set it down for my dog to try out, she wouldn't get off it. I am impressed and surprised that it supports the fluffy princess's 90 lbs. I was a bit hesitant when I purchased cause all other elevated beds I've bought just collapse when she gets on and then pop right up when she gets off. My dog loves this bed! Best purchase ever!"
4,Pet Bed,"The bed is well made and easy to put together. I wish they could make the coolaroo cover chew proof! It lasted 4 days! My fault, I should have waited until Johnny gets past the chew everything stage!:("
3,Frustrating Product!,"The product does what its suppose to do, get the dog off the floor and stay cooler. The fabric is heavy duty and the the frame sturdy. My dogs like to lay on it to cool themselves. The frustrating part is putting it together. You have to fight it. I followed one of the reviewers tips and I'm sure that made it easier but still it was a battle. And when you move it you have to press it back down because the fabric is so taut that it wants to 'buckle.' It does go back down on the floor easily when pushed. The delivery was good, not great but I opted for the free shipping so expected a bit of a delay. Great price on Amazon. Love the color and durability."
4,nice pet bed,This is the 2nd one I have purchased. Have one at home and now at the cabin. The only thing is the screws don't stay tightened if you move the bed around. We usually leave it in one place so not a big deal for us. Our dog likes the bed a lot. So does the cat!
5,lab heaven,"Older, slightly arthritic, duck hunting labrador loves it. Seems long lasting as well. Only drawback is that it is more difficult to move out of your way than a dog pillow, so you will need a good spot for it."
2,Dog doesn't like,"I bought this hoping it would be a great outdoor bed for my two dogs. As it turns lout, neither of my dogs like the bed and refuse to go on it. I can't really blame them, since the material is very scratchy feeling and rough. Perhaps they would use this bed if I put a blanket on top. I would recommend the manufacturer pick a different material, or no one should buy this."
4,"Old dog, No new tricks","I bought this bed for my 13 yr-old Border Collie/Lab Mix (50lbs)who has metabolism issues that make her always too warm. I was trying to kill two birds with one bed... help tired old bones and keep her cool. She had no objection to getting on the bed when I promoted it... but she would never sleep on it. After a couple of weeks, decided it was no go. I rated it 4 stars because I thought it was well-made; and, after reading other reviews, had no problem with assembly. Was concerned it might be too small for her but think it was just right. Ended up returning it with no hassle."
4,My dog loves his coolaroo,"When my dog is running around the backyard or with us inside, he is curled up on his Coolaroo. He prefers this to his doghouse-we have had both a dogloo and a roughhouse and he seldom goes in either.This is our second Coolaroo. The first one he did chew on a lot when he was a puppy and made some major holes that tore over time. But now that he is older he hasn't chewed it once.It is simple to put together, durable, and looks good. I like that it stays clean and keeps him clean instead of laying on the ground. He weighs about 70 pounds and the large is a good size for him."
4,coolaroo dog bed,"My dogs love these beds! the two old dogs spend most of their lives on them. The two Mastiffs also like them, but they only last about nine months with their 165 Lbs. I wish I could buy replacement covers for the extra large beds, but I can't find them. HELP! the two baby dogs have never worn theirs out, over two years. I will keep buying them."
1,chew toy,I ordered this hoping my german shepard pups would not chew it up. How ever it did last about 20 minutes. Its not chew resistant!
2,Not tough enough :(,"Bought two. Golden Puppy ate them both.The exposed edges of the material give them great biting/chewing surface, and once they discover it, well, it's all over.Both destroyed within a week."
3,it works but it dips in the middle after awhile,"It works good I bought two of them one for inside and one for outside. So far only one has started to dip in the middle. Maybe one has a defect but not sure. It is nice cause it does not hold a smell. But if it starts to smell, all you do is take it and hose it down."
4,Great but don't last long,"My Newfoundland has gone through about 5 of these in her 7 years. They're great to allow her to get off the cold or hot ground and let the air circulate, but they sure do tear often!"
3,"A bit flimsy, but my puppies like it","I got the green large size for my 2 cocker spaniel puppies. They like to lay on it together. They also dive, run and play on it. They have also caused a bit of damage from chewing on the fabric, but just a tiny spot. It is irritating to put together. I would only try it with two people. My husband and I had a hard time getting everything just right, but now it has held up for 4 months. My puppies seem to prefer a blanket on it. They like for things to be soft and the fabric is a bit course. One of them sleeps on it almost every day, but the other one just lays on it to play with toys. Overall, I think that it isn't bad for dogs that are not destructive, but I would have expected something more sturdy and well built for the cost."
5,Most Amazing Dog Bed,"ever!!! Easy to assemble, easy to clean, and excellent warranty. My dogs took to their new beds immediately."
4,Nice,This is great for my lab. The best part is she has not chewed it. The frame is very sturdy and she seems to love it.
2,falls apart when you move it,"I followed the instructions and put the bed together fine. There are no screws to actually hold the frame in place so when I pick it up to move it, the entire thing falls apart. Am I missing something or do I have a faulty bed? It makes no sense that you can only leave it in one spot. Shouldn't there be some kind of bolts that hold the frame together? Some of the pieces just slide into each other but not tightly and it would seem like they should be bolted together but there were no other holes and no bolts. Just a few screws in some of the parts but then the others just slide into each other but then slide back out if you move it. Surely this isn't the way it's supposed to be or my dog would collapse by laying on it?!"
2,coolaroo pet bed review,"The fabric part of the product sags, it seems stretched out, not tight - like a prevous coolaroo that I had. When my dog is on this coolaroo, the center of it is an inch from the ground! This coolaroo was ""on sale"". So maybe the ""sale"" on coolaroos is due to decreased quality since my last one, or maybe the ""sale"" coolaroos are returned items, or the company has surplus to unload. Since I had one before, I know this coolaroo isn't the same. I guess this is a case of - ""You get what you pay for""."
5,Great dog bed,"This is a great bed for your beloved pet! Gets them off the hard floor, puts them up on a pedestal. No pressure on the older hip joints, and great for sunning outside in. My dog is happier!"
3,Coolaroo Pet Bed,It's is as it is shown in the picture - after you get the screws tightened extremely tight! They have to be VERY tight for the bed to straighten out. Otherwise it twists and doesn't lay straight. I thought there was something wrong with it until my boyfriend used his elbow greese!
4,My dog really uses it,"I was having a tough time getting my dog to stop sleeping on the bed. I tried some other approaches that didnt work too well. Finally, I found this and bribed him with a good bed of his own. He uses it most of the time now so we are making good progress."
5,Dog Loves it!,"I bought this bed for our Rottie and she absolutely loves it! She was a bit unsure about it at first because it is off the ground, but after coaxing her a couple of times to lay on it, she realized just how comfortable the bed is. She lays on it all the time! One other thing, this bed is the only bed that has not been destroyed within the first few weeks, she did try to chew the corners but I sprayed some bitter apple on them and the chewing stopped. This really is a great dog bed. Thanks Coolaroo!!!"
5,Can hold 2 dogs,Sturdy and light. Easy to clean. No problem putting together. Great support for aging dogs. Arrived quickly. Definitely would reccommend
1,Defective,After reading all the reviews I purchased a bed for my labrador in March. I told hubby that he would have to work to get the bed on the frame and mentioned the tips I saw in the reviews. When he put it together and it went on easily and felt slightly loose I should have realized there was something wrong with it. After a week it sagged low enough that it touches the floor in the center when my dog lays on it. He still uses it and by July it had a 2 inch diameter hole in it. I'm not really impressed with this product but honestly think I just got a defective bed.
1,"Need a stronger material, dissappointed","Very easy to assemble, I ordered the Large Bed and it is plenty big for my very large Catahula Leopard Dog, and Bull Dog. It did not hold up to my puppy chewing Catahula, as the first thing he went for was the label, had it for one night and he chewed it loose. I bought 2 Large ones, I will not more, until they improve the material. I'm thinking a mesh like a trampoline. in thickness. I had such high hopes."
5,Perfect!!,I ordered this bed for my female bullmastiff as the tiles on the floor can't be that comfortable. It arrived in good time and was packaged well. The only problem i had is that after i unpacked it i found that there were no screws inside the box to put it together. Annoying but these things happen. I called the manufacturer and they just wanted my address. A week later the screws arrived. It took me about 5 minutes to put it together on my own and Luna loves it. It looks really comfortable. I am definately happy with this purchase.....10/10 :)
1,Looked good but failed after one year,"At first it was a great product and I was impressed,but after one year it came apart, threads are weakand brittle and fray at a touch.For warranty, one has to take ""PHOTOS"" and send them in,if Coolaroo feels that it was caused by UV Rays or faultyproduct you receive another fabric, but if notyou pay $8.45 plus ship which is $11.00 UPS.Shipping is $11.00 for three fabric's so get threeincase you have to buy your fabric and save."
4,Great product,"I've been looking for a bed for my Boxer for a while. We go camping quit a bit and I wanted something she could lay on to keep her off the ground (yes she's spoiled). I wanted something that was going to hold up but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg either. This product, thus far, has done exactly that. It's sturdy design leaves me no doubt that it will last for years to come. It's a bit difficult to put together but I was able to do so by myself in about 20 minutes. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because of the screws they provide. I purchased stainless steel screws so they wouldn't rust out from my local hardware store and pitched the others.Like I said I have a female boxer so I purcahsed a large but I think a medium would have done fine. Some reviews complain of the roughness of the material that the dog lays on. I didn't think it was that bad and my dog loves the bed. I would purchase this again and recommend this to anyone."
2,Watch the weight limit,"I bought the medium for my 60-lg. basset hound based on its 65-lb. rating. The first night she slept in it, the fabric stretched out so much that she was essentially laying on the floor. Not exactly functional if you follow the recommended weight limits."
3,Pet Bed Review,"This bed is fine for my mini dachshunds, but I am not quite sure it would be sturdy enough for a large dog. It is easy to clean, and was relatively easy to put together. The dogs like it, but only when a blanket or pillow is placed on top of it."
3,Defective product,"Unfortunately, we received a defective dog bed. We have had this bed for our previous dog, and loved it. We recommend assembling with 2 people, it is too hard to do by yourself. My sister has 6 dogs and 6 of these beds, she has tried other brands and loves the Coolaroo bed the best.Amazon has been great to work with for the return. We are waiting for the replacement bed, as it is back-ordered."
4,"Great for pooch in SUMMER - portable, cool, ventilated & off the ground - fleas will have no place to hide!","Love the sturdy design & material. Rubber feet grips the ground to prevent slippage. Robust steel frame is collapsible for easy storage. The all-purpose knitted state of the art fabric resists odors, moisture, fading, mildew, mold, flea & insect infestation AND, blocks harmful UV rays and allows cool, refreshing breezes to pass through - making it VERY COMFY for POOCH to lounge on. Added plus is it's portability.Washable, ventilated & off the ground, fleas will have no place to hide or breed (not that we have any to start with).For Summer, use it as it is.For winter (where moderate), add a mattress underneath and a blanket on top for warmth."
3,Works,This bed works for the price I paid. It's not the best but does work. I keep it outside in the summer on the patio. I noticed the material started to get a bit torn but still working for now. For the price I can get 3 or 4 beds compared to getting a similar higher end dog bed.
2,Fell apart,"Bought 3 of these to go with ones I had previously bought. Within less then 1 month of use, 2 of them have had the fabric unravel and pull off of the bars. I have a 70 lb dog and a 55 lb dog using them. Disappointed. May look to buying a different product in the future."
1,flimsy,This product really has no positive points.1) this was larger than I expected (pay attention to the dimensions carefully as the breed guidelines didn't really work out well for me).2) material was not as taught and firm as I would have liked (I want good back support for my pups!)3) the frame goes topsy turvy when you move it around. It is no solid frame.4) Setting it up was no walk in the park5) NOT chewproof
3,"Basic, entry level sleeping platform","This bed is adequate for my large lab/cattledog mix. The fabric is plastic-like, the legs are steel. Easy to assemble and it has stood up to some chewing and his habit of jumping onto it though the legs have started to bend which makes it a little wobbly after 2 months. If you want to find out if your dog will like this style of bed, it's a good entry-level product. Good value for the price."
1,NO replacement hammock available,"I purchased this bed for a large dog at an animal shelter I volenteer for. (The dog was nursing a leg injury and i wanted to get him off the cold concrete floor)The next day I arrived at the shelter and found the bed chewed and uselessly broken. I contacted the company only to find , they do not sell replacements for the hammock part of the bed. ONLY hardware pieces.Sadly, I had to throw away the bed and the dog no longer had one.I do not recommend this bed for a shelter situation or a dog that has a chewing tendancy."
5,Great product!,"Easy to put together, dogs love it. We live on a farm with and it's currently super muddy out and the dogs love to lay on this without laying in the mud, which is nice because there are inside dogs. Less mud/dirt = cleaner house!"
3,Nice to have,"Took 3 people to put together. It also bends strangly when you pick it up but you can twist it back. My dog sometimes uses it, moreso when theres a blanket on it the surface is hard, I thought it would have more slack, and its scratchy. It's nice to have because we have a deck, but he almost always chooses the ground next to us. He does like to eat off of it and enjoy a chewy. Overall good product would be great if he used it more."
4,It got the dog off my couch,"Putting it together was a bit of a chore. The cover makes it so the thing doesn't lay flat but rather twists, and I was a little concerned about pushing it down into a flat position to sit on the floor. The canvas seems a little flimsy for a dog. I thought the dogs claws would snag or poke right through the ""canvas"" and there goes the bed. Dog got on and immediately I could see her claws go through. My solution was to throw a pillow type dog bed of the same size on top so she never touches the actual cot material. So far so good. She actually chooses the bed over the couch and I don't have to chase her off--YEA!!! All in all I'm happy with the purchase as I got it on the gold box."
5,Dog loves it,I have a 50-60 lb collie pointer mix. She loves this bed. I love the fact it was very easy to put together and is very light. I like the fact that the material is something that is easy to clean!!! When we move I'm packing it up and putting it in my suitcase so she will have her bed right away instead of waiting on the packers and movers to bring it. :)
3,I wish I had not bought the thing,"I'm surprised that there are so many 5 stars for this product. First, it was a total pain to put together and once 3 people finally assembled the thing, it still looks unstable. One of the legs slightly bend inward. Of course, the work it took to assemblethe thing would be worth it if my dog actually liked the bed. I've put her favorite soft dog pillows on top of it to get her to enjoy it. She'll lie on it for a day, then by the next day, she's pulled off her favorite dog pillow and she's sleeping on the concrete floor again. I've owned the thing for a week and now I'm back on Amazon looking at other beds, needing to spend more money."
3,Not great build quaility,"As a few others have noted, the screws come loose after few days use. Until they improve the design I suggest buying a tube of thread lock (like loctite blue) and apply that to the screws prior to assembly. Cost about $7 at your local hardware store, or right here on amazon.My 75lb dogs love the large sizeLoctite - 243 Blue Threadlocker Oil Resistant/Medium Strength, 6 ml. (37419)"
3,"Dog loves it, but not sturdy enough for his size","Bought this bed for my 125 lb dog because he sleeps a lot and I wanted him off the ground. He loves it and it is big enough in area for him, but it has stretched and sagged so much that he now hits the ground. I got some canvas thread and stitched up all the sides to make it tight again. This worked for a while. Now the fabric has holes in it from his toe nails I think. I need to replace the cover. I had no problems assembling the bed, but I do need to tighten the bolts at least once a week. The biggest problem was the stretching of the fabric. It stretched so much that the entire bed came apart one time. I am hesitant to purchase another fabric, and go through all the stretching again."
4,Careful with the size but great bed!,"My pup Loved this bed! Sadly it's not for the XLarge breeds and ""only"" holds weights up to about 100lbs. When my guy hit 110 the fabric sagged badly but he still loved it. Last night a screw broke off inside the framework. I'm going to try to fix it but a stronger bed (one made for 110+) seems the best bet."
5,Not just for dogs,I ordered this for my 6 cats because they love to lay on suitcases. I threw a blanket over it because they have claws and they were getting caught on it. Well now sometimes they sleep under it and they have a ball playing on top and under it. They have been playing on it for months and it is holding up extremely well. It's very sturdy and they love sleeping on it too!
4,Happy Labs so far,I have two labs that have never been on a raised bed before. I ordered a large one last week via internet(Amazon)just to try it out; I received my order in 4 days in a well packaged box delivered by UPS. I put it together within 20 minutes with my dogs watching me wondering what it was. At first I had to coax them on; then added a baby size comforter and they both liked it. My one lab stretched out and slept on it that evening. The next day I noticed my other lab curled in it so I think they both adapted well and I am planning on ordering another one. I feel the fabric is strong and durable; I'm just questioning the framework wondering if it will bend at some point. I did fill out the Coolaroo warranty registration and expect they would stand behind their product.
4,Coolaroo Pet Bed - large,My dog immediately loved this bed. Easy to clean and move around....A great bed.AFTER you put it together...... It's like wrestling a greased pig. Not a one person job. Get a friend or two with a cocktail to help you. Maybe the size makes it more difficult. I will buy more and put them together as party games!
4,Large Coolaroo Dog Beds,"I have two of these for my two fairly large dogs (80 lb. Lab, 75 lb. Vizsla). The dogs love them, they have used them daily for ~5 years now and the frame and fabric material show no signs of wear. Occasionally you need to tighten the screws holding the frame together, but not more than once or twice a year. I have another dog and will buy another Coolaroo Dog bed for her, once I figure out which size is appropriate."
4,Great for dogs with arthritis,"My 13 year old arthritic hound loves his Coolaroo bed so much that I bought him a second one for inside the house. I put his old pillow-type dog bed on top of the indoor Coolaroo, and he sleeps very comfortably. I assume the sling-type bedding takes some of the pressure off of his sore joints. This is a pretty big bed, and it's not beautiful to look at, but it makes him happy. I'm giving 4 stars because the Coolaroo can be hard to put together. (When it's new out of the box the fabric is VERY tight, so you have to sort of twist the pieces together.)"
4,"Comfy bed, easy to clean and sturdy","Bought my large size from Amazon for my senior GSD about 6 months ago. Came fast, kind of a pain to put together, follow instructions from other users. I have 1 GSD and two labs. Everyone loves the bed. Takes up a lot of room so dogs often walk over it and there are a few nail holes but they haven't run or torn. Sturdy and plenty of leg room for one large dog. One night the labs both slept on it. You will have to tighten the bolts from time to time. Mine is in use by someone 24/7, they are on and off constantly during the day and night. Buy one, great air circulation, and keeps old bones off hard cold floors, doesn't smell and just hose it off and dry to clean it. Now if it could just walk the dogs and clean up the yard!."
4,Great Product,"My dog has a history of shredding his bedding. He tears through anything with padding, lining or what you might think would be comfy. The first coolaroo was a gift. It lasted for two years and I just purchased a replacement. I had considered just replacing the cover/canvas but the entire bed is so cheap that I decided to replace the whole thing. It's easy to assemble, clean and stands up well to use by an overactive pooch like mine."
2,Flimsy construction,"Bought this product for my 70-pound Boxer. I set it up and he loved it! However, within a month of daily use, the joints started to bend. After 6 weeks, it was completely broken. The joints bend easily, despite this being sold as a bed for ""large breed"" dogs. I actually bought two of these beds - one lasted for about 2 months before falling apart, the other lasted about two weeks."
3,Great for arthritic but not good for chewing puppies,Nice bed but not for any dog that chews heavily. Several foster pups have been able to destroy them very quickly. Absolutely great for elderly dogs - easy to get into and out of without slipping. Might be useful to have one with slightly shorter legs for the badly arthritic. Also wonderful for dogs that have grown out of the chewing stage.
5,"seems well made, dogs love it","It was easy to put together, it has rubber on the bottom of the feet so it wont slide. The dogs love to lay in it."
4,Yep. Dog loves it.,"Keep in mind your dog is still going to need an actual kennel, but this is good for laying on the grass so the dog can get air or sun. It's pretty sturdy."
3,"Good product, my dog just didn't like it",This is a well made product but I just couldn't get my dog on it for any length of time. She is a medium sized dog and she seems to prefer her pillow beds more. I'm just sorry it didn't work for us because it is a great idea & it is super easy to put together. I am donating it to our local animal shelter where I'm sure it will be greatly appreciated.
4,dog is ok with it....nicely made,Got this for the summer....my dog was a little timid but we encouraged her with biscuits to go on it. We ended up putting her other soft bed on it and she now gets its on it more. Its made well and medium is good. Also color is nice. Just wish our dog was more apt to get on it.
4,Dog loves it,"I wasn't sure my dog would like this bed and at first he did not.I have a 95 lb Chocolate lab and a 14 lb Chihuahua. Both dogs love this bed and chose it over their other 3 beds (which are just pillow type).We've had it about a year and it's till holding up nicely although we use this indoors so it doesn't have any UV exposure that may break down the fabric over time.The only thing I'd note is that at 95 lbs, the bed does sag so that it's almost bottomed out on the floor. IF my dog weighted another 10 lbs we probably would need the larger version.So I only gave it 4 stars because it could be slightly improved to deal with the sag, but other than that it's a 5 star product"
3,Dog likes it but still lays on the ground next to it,Got this so the dog didn't have to lay on the cement but he doesn't always use it. The medium is much larger than I expected but its too much hassle to return. Picked it based on the dogs mentioned as appropriate size for and he definitely has room to stretch out. It just takes up more patio space than we really wanted.
2,Threw Away; Metal Bent easily,"I purchased this bed for my husky as I live in Saudi Arabia and was concerned about him having a cool place to rest. The bed was of good quality (though as others have written, it was a bit challenging to put together effectively). My 60 pound husky bent the metal within 20 minutes and wouldn't sit on it after. I ended up throwing away; he never used it.One perk--my dog chews EVERYTHING, and he didn't tear at the fabric on this bed. Perhaps with a less agressive dog this will be a better purchase."
2,Too slippery,"I like the notion of this dog bed, but the plasticky mesh material is too slippery for my German shepherds. I understand that to have a mesh that will let water and air through (which it does) some compromises must be made, but none of my 3 GSDs will get on it voluntarily because their feet slide around, esp their rear feet. When I ask them to get on it (only one at a time!) and they lie down, they seem comfortable enough. I've put a soft fabric dog bed on top of the mesh and that makes it less slippery, but the point of this bed for us was to leave it outside on the deck in the rain. Adding a top bed defeats that purpose.Didn't have any trouble assembling thanks to other reviews that mention leaving slack in bolts and letting it rack.The cadet blue I ordered appears similar to the color I see on product description."
3,"Good quality, difficult to assemble, and not for everydog","The bed is extremely difficult to assemble even for two people working together. The bed quality is very good and after we finished it it looked great and sturdy. However, our dog--famous for his taste for sofas, beds, and chairs--does not stay on the bed more than 2 minutes even when he jumped on it with confidence right after we put it together. We are thinking about donate it to the local shelter."
3,"Coolaroo Large Pet Bed, Green with Black","It's ok, our dog seems to like it. Did not have to train it, she found it what it was for right away.Only down side it is not easy to setup."
4,Dog Bed,My dog is a female boxer and she loves it. She got on it right away and laid down. I would recommend it for any dog.
4,Two Large Baoxers love this bed,"We have had this bed for a couple of weeks now and both our boxers (one 95lb and one 75lb) love it. We use it inside and put a small blanket on it. The cover alone seemed a little rough. I love it because I can vac all around and under it, instead of having to move the dog bed every time I vac. I rated it a four star because it arrived with missing parts. I called the factory and they immediately sent the part to me. It was just a matter of having to wait the extra week. It does take up quit a bit of room, but hey, it's a large bed for large dogs. I had no big problem putting it together and so far see no bending of the frame, possibly a slight sag in the material although the dogs are still elevated off the floor even when both of them are on the bed at the same time. And I don't foresee the material stretching any further. For the price and even much more, I don't think you can get a better bed. We have placed an order or another, the dogs are tired of sharing."
4,My puppy loves this thing,This thing is great! My puppy loves getting on it with her toys and just hanging out.
3,Based on looks only,"Unfortunately, the bed cover was only 1/2 sewn so I couldn't put it together and had to return it. I can only review on sight only. The bed cover definitely has the ""cool"" effect, reminded me of loosely woven grasscloth so air can pass through and when hosed off the dirt can drop through BUT if you have a dog that chews (as my dog), this bed cover won't last. It would be too easy to get a grip at the corners where there are gaps and chew away. Since the covers are sold separately, another one could be purchased though. The steel seemed very sturdy. If you have a chewer, I wouldn't purchase this bed."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,I HAVE HAD THIS BED BEFORE-IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT BUT MY DOG GOES THROUGH THE COVER IN ABOUT 6 MONTHS & THE BOLTS RUSTED INTO THE FRAM--I WILL BE GREASING THEM HEAVILY BEFORE PUTTING THEM IN THIS TIME.
3,Frame great...fabric not,"I bought 2 Coolaroo beds, a medium and large. The fabric was very difficult to get on the frame and I'm usually handy. The fabric lost it's shape and I needed to tighten the screws again and again. The dogs put holes in the fabric almost immediately by their normal habit of ""fluffing and circling"" to get the right spot. I put cheap chair pads over the bed to make it last the summer and since they're dogs...they didn't seem to mind their butts hanging through the holes. The frame is in great shape so I'm going to get replacement fabric, but a canvas material would make more sense."
3,This cot does not fold,"The Amazon.com product description currently says, ""The black steel frame adds durability and class to this cot-styled bed, which folds conveniently in half for easy storage or transportation."" I thought the frame would have hinges to allow the cot to fold, but once I began assembling the bed, I realized the only way it could fold would be to remove the four screws and two of the steel tubes. If you've read the other reviews on this product, you know how difficult it is to assemble this thing! It is terribly misleading to say this product folds. I could say the same thing about my computer table; it could definitely fold if I removed most of the screwsand pulled the legs apart. However, I wouldn't say it could fold for easy transport. Don't get this cot if you are hoping to tote it in your small car along with your dog and your luggage."
4,Coolaroo Pet Bet,"I ordered the large size Coolaroo Pet Bed for our 7 month old Lab/Boarder Collie Mix. Took him a day or two to accept it, but since then loves to lay on it.It wasn't too difficult to put together, but a second person to hold one side down while the other side is put together is recommended.Seems sturdy enough - our dog is about 45 pounds right now and he leaps on it with all his weight repeatedly throughout the day.If your dog is a puppy or a chewer, you may want to supervise him/her. One corner of our bed cover is slightly chewed through and I have since ordered a back up cover. However, I think he did this on accident and hasn't shown any other signs of chewing on it (and he is a big chewer).Overall, I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for this type of elevated bed. It's a great price and a sturdy product."
1,"Chris, VA","Crappy construction - I had to use vice grips to get the bolts in the holes because they were improperly drilled. The bed sags, won't stay level, and even the dog doesn't care for it."
2,Chewing Dog Owners - Beware!,"Coolaroo Medium Pet Bed 3' x 2' green with black frame 317270It's not as durable as I had hoped for. My basset and my beagle absolutely loved lying on it, but my beagle loved it more as a new chew toy. It didn't last a month. I did discipline him when I caught him chewing on it and I sprayed it with Apple Bitter (dog chewing deterrent spray), which did not preserve the life of the Pet Bed. Also, I tried to register the warranty on-line that proved frustrating and unsuccessful. Now I will try to order a re-placement fabric and pray this time around I get lucky with the ordering through the company and with my destructive beagle."
1,would not recommend,"I bought two of these beds thinking they would be great for my dogs. They worked great for about a month. After a month, that's when all the problems started to happen. First I noticed tiny holes started to show up from my dogs getting on and off of the bed. I assume it's from their nails. I trim my dogs nails and they're not long at all so it shouldnt be doing that. Then, The bars started to bend. I bought the right size for my dogs weight so it should'nt be doing that either. The screws came loose constaintly and I always had to tighten them atleast a few times a week. Then the cover started to stretch so the holes got bigger and at this point when my dogs lay on it, there laying on the floor. I am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend it at all. This product was obviously made cheap, and was a waiste of my money."
1,Not at All Durable,"These beds come at a great price and are fairly easy to assemble... but as for durability-- no way! I have 100lb dogs that loved to lay on the beds. They did not chew them at all. The material used for the bed portion is simple ""green screen"" that you use on chain link fencing to block wind and view. What happened with all (4) of these beds was that when they got on the bed to lay down, a toe-nail would start to spread the fibers in a spot, then the tiny hole would proceed from there until the bed was 1/2 hole and not usable. (and I trim toenails religiously!) I did buy extra material, figuring that 2 -3 of those would still be less $$ than a Kuranda bed.. but over time, the inconvenience of having to replace them frequently wasn't worth it."
1,"Looked great, but mine had a manufacturing defect","This product looked great, but I believe mine had a manufacturing defect that made it impossible to assemble (the canvas part was too short on one side).Amazon was great as usual and provided me with a refund. Still, it is always disappointing to receive a defective item."
1,"BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS ""BRAND NEW"" AND IT WAS MISSING 2 PIECES","I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS ""BRAND NEW"" AND IT WAS MISSING THE 2 SHORTER PIECES THAT GO ACROSS TO CONNECT TO THE LEG PIECES. ITS REALLY DISAPPOINTING!!! NOW I HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF RETURNING IT AND WAIT FOR A REPLACEMENT!!"
1,Blah,"Dog tore through material in 5 Min. 10 minutes to assemble, in the trash in 5. Cheap price is nice but not for a chewer or bored Aussie"
2,Isn't working for my dog.,"Putting the bed together was ok. However, I found that the legs could shift when you pick up the bed from one side. We had gotten the bed because our dog kept digging to find a cooler place to lay. Our dog is about 70lbs and fit fine on the bed. He seemed to like it for a few days. Then he started tipping the bed up and digging underneath it. The hole got deep enough to where he could lay in the hole with the bed covering him for shade. Later he tipped the bed over and got his cable wrapped around it and somehow managed to pull the legs apart. So now we still have a hole in the yard and a bed in pieces."
2,Dog doesn't like it...,"This product was easy to assemble, and seems sturdy. We've had it for nearly a month now and my dog refuses to lay on it. He's gotten on a few times and circled, but never actually lays down. Even after luring him on with treats he wants to get right off! He's an older dog, so I think he just needs something a bit more comfortable. Wish it worked out better- I love the idea of being able to hose it off for cleaning."
4,Nice item for the money,"Coolaroo Large Steel-Framed Pet Bed, Brunswick GreenI found this to be light weight.Easy to handle and assemble. Just perfect for a deck or porch."
5,Great Bed!,"Initially I was skeptical about a dogs bed that only costs this much. I also knew that my dog didn't last long napping in one place before he had to relocate for comforts sake. I was delightfully surprised and pleased that he took right to it. The thought was that he would enjoy the coolness of the mesh fabric and it appears that he does. I bought a replacement cover assuming that as an 11 Month old pup he might chew threw the first one but so far so good. (That's the first thing he hasn't destroyed) He and I are both really pleased and I feel that I got a bargain.Coolaroo Large Steel-Framed Pet Bed, Brunswick Green"
5,Bella Loves This Bed!,"Bella, our 11 year old Beagle/Wire Hair Terrior loves this bed! I put it in the south window during the winter and she laid in the sun every day. Now that it is warmer, I moved it out to the deck where I had planned to use it for her. Problem. She kept going to the window inside and looking at me wondering where her bed went. I moved it back in today...and she ran and jumped up on it! May have to buy another for the deck this summer!"
3,"Great Bed, if your dog likes it...","I bought this bed thinking my dog would love a nice hammock. She did not. She is a 100lb. American Bulldog but did not find this thing comfy. Its a nice piece and plenty big, princess paws just wouldn't stay on it."
4,Great gift,"My sisters dog loves her new bed. She even snores,we no longer find her on the furnriture she enjoys this bed a lot."
3,Just OK,good concept and I like how we can leave them outside in the rain and all of that but we have to replace the nets every few months because they rip and pick and tear
2,Definetely not for chewers,Our dog destroyed it within 4 days. I wish we would have spent a little more and gotten something better. Like others reported the gaps in the corners make for an easy chew.
4,The dog seems to like it.,"A little flimsy at times if you intend on moving it, but as long as it's stationary it seems to be a pretty solid piece. I like how it keeps the dog off of the ground, and it is easily hosed off and good as new."
5,Bessie loves it,My Bessie the Basset Hound just loves the comfort of this cot and It is a very durable bed and easy to put together. She will get a lot of use out of this nice sleeper.
5,"Great product, recomend for all dog lovers! gets pets of cold floors in wintertime, and allows air to move underneath in summer!","womderful product for all small animal lovers. get pets off of cold floors in winter, & elevates for summer cooling"
3,"Great bed, Horrible cover!!!!","My Bulldogs love these beds! They keep them cool and off the floor, and it really helps with their stiff hips as well. Plus, they are WAY WAY WAY cleaner than pillow beds. The beds were easy to put together. My husband did it by himself and in about 15 minutes they were both ready to go.HOWEVER, 2 weeks later I already need to order a replacement cover for both of them... The covers are $12, which will really add up!!! It's not Coolaroo's fault that my dogs tore up the covers, but it would be nice if they could provide maybe a $20 cover that is more durrable."
1,defective fabric cover- out of the box,"I was so excited to get my bed! I purchased a large for my shephard mix. I set it up and immedialtey my 12lb bichon jumps on it and then I notice 5 puncture holes in the fabric. One hole was the size of a quarter and my big dog hadnt even got on it yet! Needless to say it went right back in the box. I should have bought a kuranda dog bed.NOt sure if this was just a bad batch? Lots of great reviews, this just doesnt add up."
4,Good dog bed (especially for outside),"I purchased the large sized coolaroo from Amazon for my 75 lb. yellow lab. It is plenty big for him and perhaps a little too big since our apartment has limited space. The metal support rods extend past the dimensions of the bed which makes it take up more room than a normal pillow-style dog bed. However, this may not be an issue if you are using it outside or in a bigger space.Overall, I am pleased with the bed. My dog took a few weeks to get used to it, but now he sleeps on it pretty regularly. We put a blanket on top of the green mesh and he seems to like that better than without it.FYI, last time I checked it was cheaper at Walmart than online."
2,"Nice dog bed, but....",My dog does not like to get on the bed because of the material the bed is made out of is very rough. I've tired covering it with a sheet with no success.
5,Takes the place of the sofa!!,"Our huge dog ( 130# ) was used to getting on our older furniture, but that had to stop with the purchase of a new sofa. He was not a happy camper until we purchased the Coolaroo for him to lay on. He is now a happy camper!! It sure takes the place of the sofa and keeps the hair on his bed and not the sofa."
3,Used in kennels,Easy to clean but hasn't held up to the constant use. Starting to sag. I bought 4 of these 4 months ago. Probably won 't replace with this product. Will do another search for something more sturdy.
5,Pet Bed,My order arrived promptly and the item is just AWESOME. I will definately order another one from AMAZON.
4,coolaroo large pet bed,"The product is everything it says it is...large, supportive, indoor/outdoor use, easy to clean...my dog got right on it and really enjoys it...only drawback is during assembly...you have to be really strong to pull it taught for final stage of assembly."
1,Fabric no match for puppy paws,This item did not hold up to our German shepherd puppy. Lasted less than a month. Fabric not strong enough to withstand constant getting on and off; sustained holes within a week. Puppy loved it while it lasted...
5,Great item,"I've been using this model for 6 years. Huskies ripped a hole in the middle of the bed which eventually needed to be replaced. The bed had been outside for 3-4 years and when I attempted to replace the cloth, it was rusted and could not be detached. Lesson is to keep joints lubricated with anti-rust or dont use them outside. I did purchase 2 more because the dogs love them."
5,Coolaroo Large Steel-Framed Pet Bed,"We have 3 dogs, 2 Westies and 1 Golden Retriever. We initally purchased the Pet bed for the Golden Reteiver that has hip dysplasia, but all 3 dogs love this bed. It's light weight and easy to move around and easy to clean. I would recommend this product to anyone. Price was very reasonable."
5,great deal for a really good dog bed!,This bed has a high quality frame and cover. I like how sturdy it looks. My dogs seem to prefer a softer bed and they always need to have a blanket or a large pillow on top of the bed. They were wary of using it at first but as soon as I covered it with something soft they jumped right on it. They love being off the ground when sleeping. Great buy!
3,"Decent, but I wish I had paid more for a better one.","This bed isn't bad for the money. You get what you pay for. This bed was nothing but trouble to put together. It took more than an hour for my fiance, my sister, and myself to figure it out. The bars did not fit so we would get 3 sides put in and could not get the 4th in. We had to bend it a weird way to make it fit. The directions were NOT helpful at all either, they had poorly labeled pictures, and nothing else.Other than the serious trouble getting the bed put together, the bed isn't bad. It is very loud in the middle of the night when the dog gets up and down and shifts positions because of the material and the way her nails rubbed on it. We put a sheet on it and it solved the problem! I have a 85 pound Great Pyrenees and it sags quite a bit, so for a bigger dog I would get a larger size. Color was more of a hunter green and not the ugly green pictured, although that could just be my monitor settings."
4,Seems good,Seems sturdy. My 60lb. dog likes it with his bed on top of the coolaroo bed (especially in the winter when it is cold on the floor). Only thing that I don't like is that it is big/bulky and doesn't fold for easy storage.
4,Coolaroo pet cot,"The Coolaroo was a bit disconcerting to my Lab when she first got on it, but that only lasted about 15 seconds. She seems to enjoy laying on it, but being only a little more than a year old, she doesn't sit still that long. I was a tad disappointed in the frame of the Coolaroo. The frame is under such tension from the bed portion, that it will pop out of shape. Easily corrected by humans and it doesn't do it unless you lift it up.Overall, it functions exactly as the advertised, but for my dog the cement is almost always cooler."
5,"so far, so good","I did alot of reading before purchasing an elevated dog bed. I purchased 2 coolaroos and 2 coleman beds. The coolaroos were easily put together except one of the screws did not screw into the pole. Once together they are sturdy on the ground. My greyhounds love them. The coleman beds have not arrived yet. For the price, I would reccommend a coolaroo. I have 2 large beds and may buy a couple more."
5,Daycare & Dogs,My dogs plus my cat love this new bed. I run a daycare out of my home and my poor dogs were constantly getting ran over by a baby walker or a riding toy. Now they have their own place to go but still be in the same room with me :)
5,Great for Dogs with Allergies,"My Brussels Griffon-Terrier Mix has horrible allergies, even with allergy meds daily. After she had an allergy test, I found out she was allergic to many weeds, dust, dander and dust mites, bugs, fleas, etc. I realized her bedding and any fabric was causing her to become red and itchy. I thought this bed would be the perfect solution. She won't sleep on it without a blanket, but even with a blanket on top of the bed, she has no allergies. This bed is a must have for any dog with allergies. My dog is around 12 pounds and used to sleep in bed with me, she typically doesn't sleep on her own bed, but she loves this one! She would still rather lay on my bed or the couch but for her allergies and comfort, this is the best."
2,Didn't Last Long,"I would have to say I was dissapointed in this product, being it is made for dogs, and within a week it was useless. It has a large hole in the middle, probably from our smaller dogs sharp nails. You would think (especially since I got the Large size Bed) that the material would be better made for the weight and habits of dogs with their scratching when they like to lay down etc. I was thinking about getting the replacement cover, but saw the reviews saying how they replace them every other month due to rips. No Thanks."
3,Not for chewers or frequent moving around,"A bit disappointed by this bed. Seems durable enough, but the fabric doesn't extend all the way to the corners, which allowed my dog to get his snout in there and start chewing. Just a little bit of extra fabric would have prevented this. It's stable if left on the ground, but when you pick it up the legs go a bit wonky due to the fabric pulling on them, which loosens the screws. This is a great bed for dogs that don't chew if you plan on leaving it in the same place most of the time."
5,Best thing out there,"Its very comorftable for dogs, my doberman is on his back half the time. THE BEST PART: All his hairs go UNDERNEATH and allow for such easy cleaning because he will never disturb the floor beneath. It was kind of easy to install, just tighten them gradually, together otherwise you end up with the thing looking like a male dog peeing (by the way, when will my dog stop drenching his front legs and pick up the rear??) The leg side matters when inserting, so look for the difference in the sizes of the holes (inside or outside)"
3,part not right,When assembling we could not get the screw in one of the legs due to mis-drilling at factory. I called and they promised to send a new leg. That was a month ago. I have rigged it to work for now but still am waiting for new part to arrive.
4,Shared by a German Shepherd and a medium sized yellow Lab,My dogs are tough on everything. The frame of this product has held up well and the fact that the cover is easily replaceable is great. I am on my 3rd cover in just about a year. I order these to always have on hand. The first one wore out because of the dog's scratching it. The second cover my lab chewed. Not much can be done about either. Overall I am satisfied.
4,Great product!!,"It was easy to put together and seems to be made really well. Cleans easily and so far I have had a 55lb and 25lb dog on it at once and held just fine with plenty of room for them to be comfortable. I however did end up buying a simple bed to go on top because none of my four dogs wanted to get on it at first, but they are used to sleeping on dog beds so that could have been the issue. The material has a little flex in it so it seems it would be more comfortable than laying on a flat surface with a bed. Buying another to satisfy by other two."
3,Pet Bed Replacement Cover,"The replacement covers installed easily. My dogs love these beds!I only wish the covers lasted longer than 6 months. I live in Hawaii, so the beds are outdoors and get a lot of sunshine. Not sure if the wear down is more the result of UV rays or just the constant use by the dogs. But the frames seems to be holding up well."
4,good bargain,This has served the purpose very well. We have 2 small to medium size dogs. It's sturdy and was easy to assemble.
5,Easy assembly,Well built construction easy to put together. Both of my Queensland Healer's enjoy being off the ground looking over the 44 acres they patrol.
5,Elevated Pet Beds,This product is best on market! Use them thruout kennels - both for our boarders and adoptive pets we have rescued from euthanasia. Covers withstand the toughest of punishment!
5,"Great bed, & cat loves it!","My Shepard never gets a chance to lie in it, as the cat is always in it! And set up took about 5 minutes."
5,Coorlaroo Pet Bed,"This product is well built and easy to assemble, I use them to train my dogs to learn ""place"" command and is great. Would suggest to everyone and seems to be really durable as I can stand on it and it is strong."
4,Coolaroo Pet Bed,"My Corgis needed a bed off the ground. Coolaroo medium was the perfect height and size. From previous reviews, I learned it could be hard to put together. Because of this, I took my time and had no problems. The bed worked great for about five minutes. That is how long it took for the Corgis to rip the bed cover material to pieces. I even purchased a replacement cover to no avail."
4,Comfy,Our 60 lb Weimer loves her new bed. She took to it right away. Laid one of her dog pads on it for added comfort. Considering another for the shop when she is working with dad. Nice if she could lay above the hard cement floor.
5,It's a keeper!,"I had a coolaroo 15 years ago, and this one rocks it out! I (and my pup) are so happy to be getting off the hard patio and onto a soft, hammock-like surface. And, the quality of this is unmatchable. It even has tabs on the bottom so it won't scratch surfaces. It is awesome!!!!"
5,Dogs Love These!,"We have a Black Lab and and English Setter. We bought just one at first to make sure they'd use this style, and they both were on it on the first day, so we bought another. Our first one was from Amazon and our second from EntirelyPets. Our second order arrived the very next day. Fast shipping! The beds are easy to assemble and easy to clean. I also love that replacement fabric is available if we need it down the road. The beds are great for the summertime when the dogs don't want to cuddle up in their hot, fluffy winter beds. Very happy with the product and the sellers."
5,"Dog is happy, so I'm happy.","If you have a dog that likes to sit in the yard watching the birds and enjoying the breeze, you can't go wrong with this product. We live in Texas and even in the 105 degree heat, the canvas on the cot is cooler than the ground. Easy to assemble, sturdy, great price."
5,Coolaroo Pet Bed Green w/ Black Frame Lg,"I love these beds. My dog is old and laying on the floor is not good for him, and he's getting too old to jump up on the sofa. He is very happy with new bed."
4,"Not as pictured, but still great!","The product I received was slightly different from the picture or assembly instructions, but it was still easy to figure out the difference and how to put it together. I have a nervous weimeraner and lab who stay in a large kennel in the garage, and wanted this bed to keep them off the floor for cleanliness and coolness. I should have introduced them to the bed inside with me at first, because the very first time it was in their kennel the weimeraner chewed at the corners. She did not like the rough texture. However, I covered it with a sheet and she got used to it, and now goes right in and sits on it when it's time for me to leave every day. I think it's a great product, and most dogs who are not as high maintenance as mine will enjoy it easily."
3,Dog loved it!,"My 50lb Huksy loved this cot. It was a bit difficult setting up because of the fabric, but overall my dog loved it! Bought it in October of 2011. The screws finally gave out.. She would jump on it when going to lay down.. and half of the screw just broke off in the end piece. Overall, it's better for a less active dog.. If your dog is over 50lb and likes to jump this is not the cot you want. The fabric never ripped.. she would scratch it... So that that was a plus, until the screw broke. I was looking for something a bit stronger and just found the Kuranda dog beds. So, I'll be reviewing that next."
5,BEST PET BET I'VE FOUND,"RECENTLY I PURCHASED A TOTAL OF TWENTY-THREE COOLAROO PET BEDS FOR OUR HUMANE SOCIETY ANIMAL SHELTER IN ALL THREE SIZES. THEY WERE AN INSTANT SUCCESS. THE FIRST ONE WE ASSEMBLED, (LARGE), WE GAVE TO AN OLDER GERMAN SHEPARD WHO WAS RECOVERING FROM AN INJURY. SHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS AND UNCOMFORTABLE ON A BLANKET ON THE CONCRETE FLOOR. WHEN WE GAVE HER THE BED, SHE SNIFFED IT, CLIMBED ON IT AND WENT TO SLEEP. SHE SEEMS TO BE RECOVERING FASTER, TOO. THESE BEDS ARE VERY EASY TO ASSEMBLE, WITH JUST FOUR SCREWS. THEY ARE ALSO VERY STURDY. THE FABRIC IS TOUGH BUT COMFORTABLE. THE KENNELS ARE CLEANED DAILY AND THE BEDS ARE EASILY MOVED AROUND. I AM ORDERING TWO COOLAROO BEDS FOR OUR OWN ADOPTED SHELTER DOGS."
4,coolaroo,"Dogs will love this pet bed. It is durable and easy to care for. This is a much cleaner bed for your pet!The only difficulty is the initial putting together of the last pipe. It is very hard as in order to keep the bed taught, it has very little room to stretch to fit those last pipes together."
4,Just got the bed...,"We just got the bed delivered to us today.... My lab just loved it and jumped right upto it.. He's snoring in it right now in a belly rub position ;)I have to wait and watch how well it lasts, but it was extremely easy to assemble (using the tricks some folks posted in their reviews). It took me and my husband a total of 7-8 mins to assemble.It looks pretty good and the fabric seems really breathable and easily washable.. I might end up getting another one if this one turns out well.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I paid almost $42 for it including shipping (from entirelypets on amazon) whereas I see it being listed for $32 with super saver shipping now.Its still a great buy though from the look and feel of it so far."
5,A Bed My Dog Can't Chew Up,"Love, love, love this bed. My dog has chewed up everything that I have purchased until now. She loves this bed. I don't know how I lived without it. I would recommend it to everyone whose dog destroys the ""cushiony"" beds."
5,"Love these, super tough","We bought two of these for our dogs, a German Shepherd and a Great Pyrenees. We were honestly skeptical at first since they weren't outrageously expensive and weren't sure it would hold up to our GP.Well they have not only held up to our dogs, but they even hold up to our GP and my 100 pound daughter, together on one Coolaroo!Our dogs love them too. At first it took a little getting used to for them, but once they were comfortable with them, they always sleep on them.I would highly suggest these for just about any dog."
4,Good outdoor cot for dogs.,"This pet bed is exactly what I expected. I have two dogs, each weighing about 30 pounds. I purchased the large bed and they can both lay on it comfortably at the same time. It's a good product."
5,Jose,"Coolaroo Elevated Pet Bed with Knitted Fabric, this bed is excellent quality the metal frame structure is well made and the fabric is very cool even in hot days here in California my dog loves it, he spend most of the day in it.I'm very please with this product. We have bought this product before and lasted 3 years which is excellent for what it cost."
4,Dogs love it,"Overall this is the best bed for my two large dogs....we keep two on the deck, and two inside for them. They just love 'em.My only complaint is the difficulty in assembly, trying to get the last leg/side together. Other than that, great value, and durability."
4,good item,"Good item, a little difficult to put together though. Trying to pull the material enough to fit over the bars was reall difficult but we managed to do it. The shipping was semi-fast. My dogs love it!"
2,Not Sure.,I have 2 dogs...one of them a 190 pound Neo Mastiff...neither of the dogs will lay on this bed. I don't know if they dont like the material or ? I bought 2 beds...gave one away...the other...I am still trying to get the other dog to lay on...We'll see!!It was a bit difficult to put together!
2,paint chips,This bed was a pain to put together and came with the paint chipping. We have a crawling baby in our home and are not a fan of having items in our house that have unknown paint chips that can flake off and end up on our floor and possibly in her curious hands. We sent it back.
5,Good for a damp day,"The poles were hard to adjust to make the bed lay flat, but with a second person helping me, it worked out fine. It is the perfect size for my Lhasa Apso who is the larger of the small breeds. Dogs longer than a Lhasa should probably get the medium.Once it was outside in the rain, and when I picked it up, red water ran out of it. The screws must of rusted in trapped water. yuck.Regardless, I cannot get my dog to use it. I've put it in her favorite spots in the yard, by the gate, under the tree, next to the porch, and she will lay right beside it but not on it. I've put her on it and given her treats, even put it inside by the couch, she doesn't get it or doesn't like it. So, while it may be a good product, it doesn't work for her!"
2,dangerous,"Awhile back I purchased three large Coolaroo steel framed pet beds.They each held several of my dogs comfortably.I used them for several months,until my shih tzu Glory B got her head caught in the wedge shaped corner of the frame overnight.She died as a result.I will never again use one of these beds.If you have samller dogs stay away from these.Larger breeds might be ok,but not the smaller ones."
1,Cover didn't even last 5 minutes!,"My old (e.g. not rambunctious) 80 lb lab stepped on this bed (large size) and stepped right through! The cover ripped completely. The plus is we can buy replacement covers, but if they are that weak, it will get pricey fast. Possibly by somehow securing a blanket over the bed this would have worked better; however that will limit its use outside.Also, I did not find this a joy to put together. It took a little finesse to get it nice and sturdy. It was not difficult, just be warned that you should clear a space and some time first.Bottom line: not recommended for large/heavy dogs or rambunctious dogs with long nails."
2,coolaroo dog bed,"These beds will not hold up to English bulldogs. As far as the dogs are concerned they like them. After about three months they had chewed holes in them and had to be replaced. Kuranda beds however will withstand all my dogs,and have for years no holes yet. So if you don't plan on replacing your dog beds don't buy these."
3,Easy to assemble and very sturdy.,"I purchased 2 of these for my German Shepherd/Lab mix pups. The were easy to put together, but I haven't put them outside yet. They look sturdy enough and will be easy to spray off. One of the beds showed up out of the box within the mailing box and the mesh part of one was a little torn on one corner. I'm going to write the company and see if they will replace. In the mean time, I'm afraid that my teething 7 month old pups will be encouraged to chew on the mesh. They are constantly chewing and it doesn't look like the mesh could take it. It would be destroyed immediately. I've got to give it a little time before introducing them to their new beds."
3,great bed poor support,"We have used the bed for two years, but have to replace the entire item when it is worn out because we can't find a provider for just the cover. the cost of the bed isn't bad, but it goes against the grain to have to throw the complete bed away when all that is needed is a cover. I would have given a 5 if covers were available."
1,flimsy waste of money,These beds are absolutely horrible. Don't even bother buying replacement covers you'll never be able to use them. The beds are unstable and the screws used to fit the metal frame together often do not even fit.
1,Dog will not use,"I have tried laying on the bed with her, she looks like she is being punished. She refuses to use the bed. I have tried laying her balnket there, tried putting her toys on the bed. So far she acts as though she will never use the bed. Great, now what?"
3,Great idea - but dog is uneasy,"I received this product and was happy with the design and quality. It does take two people to put together, but it was pretty easy and quick. However, my 4 yr. old Lab/Boxer mix is very uneasy and has ignored it. When I first introduced it to her, she tentatively got up on it, but it was as if she were trying to walk on a water bed. I encouraged her, gave her treats, even took her old bed out. She chose the floor. About the third time she attempted to get on it, the rubber padded feet squeaked a bit on our hard-wood floor, and that was it. She is normally not that afraid of things, and when she was smaller, her favorite snoozing spot was an ottoman, so I thought she would love this. Now, because I don't want to pay shipping to send it back, I'll give it away or sell it in a garage sale."
3,"As described, but my dogs won't go near it","This ped bed is just as it is described, and assembly is very easy. It's all high quality. However, neither my English Springer nor my black Labrador Retriever will lay on it. I've gotten them to sit on there, but they won't go on it by themselves, ever. They'd rather sit on the ground or dig a hole in the dirt. The canvas holds water, so it's not a good idea for outdoor use."
1,WORST INVENTION EVER,This is a torture device. The material is rough and the thing twists and folds whenever my chihuaha would try to use it. It scared the heck out of her. It was the worst purchase ever. I ended up getting rid of it at a yard sale to a curious buyer for 1 buck. It was horrible.
1,Still waiting,"Still waiting for items.It's been over a month now.Can some one follow up.I still want items,which already been paid for."
1,Could do A LOT better,my yellow lab hates it he refuses to lay on it and the fabric stuff is so scratchy dont waste your money
4,Recommend cot,"I have had the cot bed for a little over a week. The good news is that my female lab-mix seems to love it. I just put her blanket on the harsh material and it worked. Also put a treat on bed so she would have to get on it.The bad news is that it did not come with the 4 screws. They did not have the screws at Lowe's so I bought them at Ace Hardware. I could have sent it back, but didn't want to wait. Spent a little over $2.00 for screws.Did not take long to put together, about 15 minutes. Other reviews are correct when they recommend that you keep screws loose until all of them are intact, then tighten while cot is on the floor. You will probably have to re-tighten occasionally but I find that it's worth it to have a dog bed that is comfortable.Recommended for large dogs that can flatten those pillow beds easily."
5,Awesome,"I have this outside in my dog kennel, My lab and my terrier both sleep on it everyday. They LOVEE IT. I would highly recommend. It is made well, keeps my dogs off the ground and cool."
5,Great product,This is a great product. I had to buy a second one because my foster dog loves sleeping on it as much as my own dog. It is super easy and fast to set up. The Coolaroo is a great on hot days when ventilation is needed to keep my dogs cool.
3,My dog is eating her new bed,My dog loves this bed so much she has chewed a hole in the middle. I've tried spraying with bitter apple but it hasn't helped.
5,LOVE IT !,This is the greatest dog bed for our deck. Our 90lb lab/mix took right too it. The material seems very sturdy and will dry quickly. There are a few reviews complaining about putting it together. It wasn't that bad. If it weren't a little tight then the bed would sag. One reviewer put it best when they said to make sure you leave all the screws loose until you have it together. I want a human sized one for myself.
3,works great,my dogs love this and can not rip/tear it up like the other beds. plus it does not stink like the traditional beds. buying another one for my other dog..
1,Waste Of Money,"We bought 4 beds from them for our large dogs in Sept of 2010 and less than a year later 3 out of 4 have holes in the fabric from regular dog use. We called the company about their ""5 year fabric warranty"" and they said it's only a uv breakdown guarantee - what a croc. If you have large dogs you can forget it - a complete waste of your money. We're going to a canvas fabric bed from another manufacturer this time. Ridiculous"
1,Doesn't stay horizontal,"After assembly, one of the legs popped up and the bed was in a twisted shape. After straightening out with the help of another person, I tried to tighten the bolts more to hold the frame in horizontal shape, but it twists up again. The combination of the fabric tension and the fact that frame pieces do not have a locking mechanism, makes it hard to keep the pieces in place just by tightening."
3,Good Product - Crappy Support,"My bed arrived missing the screws. At the least, I expect a product to have all the parts in the packing. I emailed them, not asking for a refund or even to send me the missing screws, but simply what size the screws are so I can go to Lowe's and purchase them myself. Almost a week later, they still haven't responded. I ended up having to figure it out myself (5/16"", 1-1/2 works - not sure the length they send with it though).The bed is only hard to put together if you're a complete moron.Once together, it's solid and comfy. My 50lb pit mix, Daisy, likes it fine enough. I may order a couple more for different rooms and outside."
5,My dog love his new bed.,I bought this for our RV. When we stay outside at the campground he does not have to lay on the ground. We have a puggle and the medium is a great size for him.
5,Exellent piece of kit........,"What can i say, another great piece of kit, from sony. I have purchased other minidisc players, but i have only found sony to be the best out of the lot. The MZR-90 has some exllent features on it. For example LCD on both the unit and the remote control, this means that you dont have to fish the unit from your pocket to look at the name of the track, or to change it. The unit also has better bass on it than other minidisc players i have bought, thanks to sony. I'd say if you were looking to buy one, this is the best one to get, you won't find a beter one!!!!!!"
5,OFF THE HOOK,"WUZUP YALL!!!!!!! LET ME TELL YALL RIGHT NOW. THIS CD, THE MASTAPIECE, IS OFF THE CHAIN. REBEL AND DOMINATOR SPITTEN SOME TIGHT LYRICS. THIS ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS THAT U COULD LISTEN TO THE WHOLE WAY THROUGH WITHOUT SKIPPIN TRACKS, IM TELLIN U!!!!! GO GET THIS CD!!!!!"
5,Great product!,"Finally my kitchen counter is neat and clean again! I have been looking for something like this in the stores and had not been able to find one. So glad to have a proper place to tuck away the dishtowels. Easy install, is working great!!"
4,I found what I wanted,I had a similar towel bar in our former home. I looked for a while before I found this one. The spacers are super.We were able to get it out away from the wall so all three bars are usable. The only complaint I have is that it does not move very smoothly when you pull it out.
2,Rev-a shelf,3-prong shelf use it once and one of the arms fell off not a happy camper. Other than that the other 2 arms are holding .
5,Best Mini disc so far,"I recieved this Mini Disc for my birthday, and at first I thought that this Mini Disc is boring, all my friends had it, etc. but then when I checked out the player itself, and then started recording, I realized that this Mini Disc player is perfect for anyone that loves music, and it comes with all the proper recording materials, and the clearness etc. is wonderful.This product is for any age. I give it 18 stars!!!"
4,okay,"I've had this recorder/player for about 4 weeks. My model comes with the USB connector and the rechargable battery. I'm very happy with the playback, however, the recording process is not very easy. The usb connector is completely pointless, i get the same exact sound quality from the headphone jack on my computer. In addition, when recording from your computer, you cannot run any other programs that use sound, or else your mini disc will record them. In addition, the music is not very loud at all, i leave all of the volume controls on my computer all the way up, but on the mini disc, you have to put it on full for the music to be audible."
2,Please!,"This is a good MD player for the money. But it['s no good] because on the back of the player there is a big lump. Because they make u use a regular battery. Then on top of that the remote isn't LCD. And its not as easy to use. For a few buck more you can get a MD (Sony MZR55) with digital recording, a flat battery, LCD remote that decplays the song title and time. Plus its way easyer to use. I belive this is just the sonys WAY cheaper version of the MZR55. So only buy this if your low on cash and you want to show NO TASTE!"
1,Missing parts and does not work.,"Shady deal. I used it for the first time the disc locked up and would not play. I tried different disc, ejecting the disc and reloading and still it doesn't work. So it is usless and a waste of $100. I owned one of these befoe so I know that there is no way the seller wasn't aware of this. Nice to know people in California still all show and no substance."
2,Coal In My Stocking,"I was pleased to recieve the Mini Disc Player/Recorder I was puzzled by the condition it was in. It appeared to be heavily used with out too much care. The Discs I previously recorded did not play well on this machine and the audio sound was poor 1 out of poss 5. No Battery, no head set, no other accessory was sent with it, nothing not any soft ware or cables not even an old owners guide to show me how to use it properly.I think I've been good this year, Santa why do I feel like I've been ripped off by Elfs.Maybe two stars was too generous, maybe a star and a half is closer to the truth.Needless to say I'm not happy at all"
4,Oh yes,I checked this product out in the store and it looked flimsy. Never tried it so don't know much about it. Sorry.
5,Well worth it!,"I saw the video Chris made for ""My Love Goes On and On"" before I ever heard it on the radio. I thought that the song was so much fun that I had to try other songs, but before I could, I saw the cd in a store and couldn't resist buying it! As soon as I heard songs like ""Laredo"" and ""Rock the Boat"" I could not help but love the rest of the cd too! This cd is one of the best I have heard in a long time by ANYONE (country or otherwise)! It is well worth buying! Good Job Chris! :)"
5,Some thoughts on the best looking and singing Country star,"On and On got me hooked on Chris Cagle, now I'm hooked on Laredo! It's the greatest country song I've ever heard! Plus, as a teenager, I feel that he is one of the sexiest older men in the world! He sings with such compassion and emotion-who couldn't love him!"
2,Listen to the reviewers!,"First, the good news: the calendar looks nice and the stickers are fun for the kids. (That's what lured me, the stickers.)Second, the bad news: it's not all that well done. The weeks are arranged horizontally which means that one has to write the family members' names 4-5 times per month into their little boxes - that's a huge waste of time and simply annoying. Then, the boxes are too small - one can fit one engagement per day per person which is NOT enough, believe me. There are too many graphics; as someone else already mentioned, the illustrations are often dark and block out entire days. The stickers don't stick well and are too big for the little boxes.So, the calendar is fun to look at and frustrating to use. We used the Mom's Family Calendar by Sandra Boynton for years and wanted something different this year. But one week into the new year and we went out and bought it again. It's just much better than this one."
3,Pretty Good,"I really like this calendar, I purchased the 2005 version in a card store at half price so now I'm going crazy trying to find the 2006 at resoonable price (and $13.99 doesn't cut it!). The main problems that I had was that the pocket wasn't deep enough, I had no use for the extra 5 months (since I always began with January and ended with December) and the worst part was probably that as I moved into the year the past months made the calendar top heavy and kept falling off the fridge. That forced me to rip early months out which made the calendar fall apart. The calendar is colorful, and leaves space for notes (which is a must). The maganet is by far the best aspect, making it very easy to jot down notes as I walked by the fridge."
3,I LOVE this calendar...it's the BEST!,I LOVE this calendar. I buy it every year. This is the best calendar for busy families who need to keep track of schedules and invitations. Lots of spaces to write in appointments for everyone and helps keep you organized. Hangs on the side of my fridge b/c of the great magnet strip across the top. Have never really used the stickers so I give them to the kids to play with. (...)
2,2006 Mom's Plan-It Plus Calendar,It's ok except for the fact that you have to write everyone's name in every month & the stickers fall off the sticker sheet! I have lost some stickers because they're just not sticky.
2,Poorly laid out,"I received this as a gift and initially thought it was going to be the business. It quickly proved to be a disappointment. On the plus side: compact size, smart magnetic strip to hold it to the fridge and nice graphics & stickers. On the negative side: as mentioned by another reviewer, names of each family member have to be written out for each week due to the horizontal lay out (pretty ridiculous), flip side of compact size means that the slots for appointments are small, so you'll need to write small! Also, the layout means that a week is presented in the American format: Sunday to Saturday, whereas since we now live in Europe, the week begins with Monday and ends on Sunday. This format is easier because you see your weekend days together. The Boynton Family calendar offers a better layout, even though it is possibly just a bit TOO big."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking for a good ""mom"" calendar, that had pockets to hold reminders for school field trips, doctors appts, etc.This calendar is disappointed in two main areas:1) There are a lot of cartoon drawings, all over each page. While they are cute, the drawings should have been contained to the borders of the months. These drawings prevent me from just glancing at the calendar to see what is going on for the week or day. The drawings ""fill up"" some of the days and make you spend a little more time staring to see which days/weeks are free.2) There is only one pocket for the whole year. Pocket calendars that I have used in the past have a diff pocket for each month.Lastly, the stickers that are included that say ""doctors appt"", ""no school"", etc. are useless. They blend in with the drawings on the page. Plus the writing on the stickers is so small that you are better off just writing ""no school"" on the calendar."
2,2005 calender was much better! Why the change??,"I like the format of this calender, and the bright colors, the stickers, and I don't mind writing out the family names. But the 2006 calender has gone completely Christian! From the Christian bible verse on the front cover, to multiple 'bible study' and 'churh event' stickers. So if you're Jewish, Muslim, non-religious, other religious, be warned. I won't buy this calender next year, but will look for something more inclusive."
4,Happy,Book doesn't have the cover but at the same time at the pages were there. Came on time and didn't have to wait long
3,Clint in the City,"The second Don Siegel movie from 1968 about a cop in NYC hunting the killer who stole his gun. (Paging Dr. Freud.) This one has some of the same cast as Madigan, but it's more set-bound and has a T.V. movie feel. Not to mention the instantly dated hippie scenes. (Plus, it's hard to feel much menace when one of the principal heavies is played by David Doyle!) It's odd to think that Clint didn't always enjoy a solid reputation as an actor, because he's easily better than anyone else here.And note the motorcycle chase through the Cloisters that foreshadows Black Rain."
1,Dumb movie and dumb lines.,"This must be the worst movie Clint Eastwood ever made. Le't start with the storyline, it was infantile. Continuing with his acting: he acted like a robot saying asenine lines. Concluding with the situations he was put in: they were beyond belief.PS: the women acted like he was the only man around.All-around dumb movie!"
2,Seems to be edited,"Limp movie by today's standards, with jarring switches from locations in NY to obvious Universal studios backlot. Very TV movie in its look and overuse of extreme closeups. A view of the 60's counterculture that didn't even ring true then. I also seem to recall that when I saw this in the 60's that Susan Clark points out the actual Coogan's Bluff (a real natural landmark in NY) to Eastwood's character during their scene above the Cloisters. She tells a little story about it, tying it to the character's ""bluff"" about how tough he is. If I am recalling correctly, that scene has been clumsily trimmed out on this DVD. Note how in one shot Eastwood is wearing his hat, but in the very next one it is off. At that point the dialogue appears to jump from one subject to an entirely different one. Without this scene the title doesn't even make sense anymore"
2,10-gallon Hat Eastwood in New York City,"This is great for Eastwood lovers, unless you don't like to see him getting beaten up and bloodied (on several occasions). However, he does beat up lots of baddies in return and makes love to lots of chicks."
2,My favorite star placed in a wrong enviroment,"I have loved every Clink Eastwood video or movie I have seen and have purchased many of them. I enjoy looking at those old standards several times. This video is not one of them. He tracks a bad guy ""somehow"" the ""indian"" shoots at very close range with a rifle and misses twice, Clink gets the snot beat out of him every time till the last short fight. He acted like a hick, behaves badly, acts like a tramp and make NY cops seem like idiots. Even the T&A shots while nice are just flashing images. No story, bad acting, no logical ending, save your money."
3,An Offbeat Siegel-Eastwood Collaboration,"""Coogan's Bluff"" (1968) was Clint Eastwood's second American starring film - an offbeat crime thriller directed by the lean, coolly efficient Don Siegel. Despite the TV-movie budget and some dated elements, Siegel delivers the action goods. A stalwart supporting cast (Lee J. Cobb, Susan Clark and Don Stroud) works well with Clint's steely-eyed presence. The first Siegel-Eastwood collaboration remains a fascinating precursor to 1971's ""Dirty Harry."" Regrettably, the DVD lacks a single extra - not even the original trailer (which can be found on YouTube)."
4,"Good, cracking entertainment","I caught this movie on late night TV some time ago and ever since then I've always had a real liking for it. It's not a big, heavy thriller like some of Clint Eastwood's other films, it's just plain, light-hearted fun. It's BULITT with less inteligence but more entertainment. Highly reccomended."
3,Oh Brother!!!,"Finally sat down and watched this.This Dvd has A silent menu,I rate this movie fair.Run's 94 Min.Coogan has no manner's,need's to have his ass kicked,New York took care of that.Yay!Just who the hell does he think he is in the beginning?Did finally learn some manner's in the end,bout' time.Ladie's man literally,and Julie was A fool playing right into his hand's especially at the end,he could care less.In order to get what he wanted,and then some,A user of women and messin' with their feelings,like their thinking they are the only one,not gonna happen.I liked this when I was A kid,not so much now."
4,Coogan's bluff or Huntington's disease !?!,"Coogan's Bluff (Don Siegel), USA 1968When Arizona deputy sheriff Coogan and his Stetson hit 'Pigeon-Toed Orange Peel' club in the Village, a 'clash of civilizations' hangs in the air. Quite unable to make 'peace' Coogan is yet ready for occasional 'love'.Great 1968 Siegel/Eastwood collaboration! Siegel's son Kris Tabori came up with the discotheque's name which was in fact the sound stage for ""Phantom of the Opera"" on the Universal lot. See Don's auto(film-)bio 'A Siegel Film' for more details.Do you think this film should go BLU too?Visit my Listmania lists 'Friends of Blu-ray' Pt. I-V"
2,"Interesting performances, but abysmal sound quality","This disc contains live performances from roughly the same time period as the Sabotage/Live album. There's some very interesting material here that is not available elsewhere. Most importantly, this is the only recording I know of that features performances with Judy Nylon.Unfortunately, the sound quality is poor even by bootleg standards. It sounds like the shows were recorded from out in the parking lot. This is a real shame because for the most part, Cale and his band sound quite strong. This version of ""Helen of Troy"" is really powerful and aggressive.Due to the poor sound quality, this cd can only be recommended to diehard Cale completists. If you are interested in a good recording from this era, check out Sabotage/Live instead (with Deerfrance subbing for Nylon)."
4,Inspiration for you,"I saw this book at a Mosaic class and was impressed by it. I found that it had a lot of good ideas; interesting projects and provided a lot of information to the newbie. I love purchasing used books from Amazon, if I see a book somewhere that I like I always check to see if I can find it used on Amazon. By purchasing books this way I don't feel guilty. :)"
3,Some history and a lot of technique,"I could use the materials instruction, but from the title I was expecting to find more photos of ancient art and amazing technique. Even the old works shown were photographed from too far away see much other than they were huge.The contemporary art projects were odd choices. I was not inspired by them. Get this book on sale."
2,Glosses over basics,"I have to disagree with those reviewers who have already weighed in on this book. Perhaps they are already experienced in making mosaics. As someone who has not done mosaics before, I was hoping for a little more discussion of the basics. For example, there is a list (and even photographs of) tools to use to cut tile, but not really any discussion on how to do it. Also, the history lesson on mosaics is somewhat brief, with not very many photographs of ancient mosaics."
5,One of the few TRUE restaurant cookbooks.,"An avid fan of indian cuisine, I have many cookbooks. All of them,including some that claim to be 'restaurant cookbooks', fail. They all tend to give the usual classical recipes with small variations. This book is different. It gives the secrets away and the results are impressive. I found that in a short while I was able to produce authentic restaurant style currys etc in approx 10-15 minutes. Interestingly, this style of cooking can produce curries that have more flavour than the more elaborate styles. The author claims to be a chef in England which I can believe. He demonstrates knowledge, and exposes tips that it took me over 15 years of trial and error to learn. I wish I had this book earlier!"
3,A piece of Los Angeles Music History,"A lot of bubble gum b.s on the album, but to hear the Premiers ""Farmer John"" and ""DUffy's Blues"" makes the c.d. worth having. Too bad the artists won't get any of the proceeds. DIg on the Baritone Sax on F. John, a great party tune."
3,A little too thick for me.,"I like the way they feel but in some of my shoes, they feel too thick (make the shoes tight). Also, they shrunk quite a bit even though I washed them according to the instructions. Maybe if you buy one size too big you would be better off."
5,Great socks,These socks are really great not only for being out doors hiking or walking but I wear them around the house too. Very comfortable.
4,Pretty good socks!,"Here's my laundry list:Pros:-Soft-Look cool (lines along each side w/ differentiating color). I like the gray ones the most.-Breathable-AbsorbantCons:-Tough (not that stretchy). I guess you could consider this a pro, too-Not that warm in the winter-This is just a con in general about wool socks. Since they're more expensive, I take better care of them than my other clothes, and so I wash these by hand. Since they soak up so much water, it generally takes a while to clean these. Once cleaned, they take anywhere between 1.5-2 days to try at room temperature.I would recommend these to anyone. I'm never going back to cotton socks!"
3,Extremely Comfortable,"Admittedly I don't wear these for hiking, but for wearing around the house and walking around they are amazing. I've often imagined what it would be like to walk on clouds and I'm pretty sure these socks are the closest I will ever come to doing that."
5,excellent,"I like this book very much, I took speedwriting in college and it refreshed my memory, I am learning it all over again i am learning at my own pace. very good book to have!!!"
2,not a kids toy,"I bought this for a six year old as a present, this telescope is VERY touchy, your eyelashes move the eyepiece, the plastic mount to the tripod flexes a lot, and there are loose pieces of plastic inside all of the eyepieces right in the center of the viewing area. otherwise it is all you can expect for an economy unit"
2,"Difficult to position, wobbly tripod","Received as a gift, wish it was easier to use. Yes, it brings the moon into view quite well, but positioning it to view a star, like Betelgeuse, was impossible for me. It brought Jupiter into view, but again not well enough for me to see much detail. Our park district is offering a telescope class - I plan to attend. I'm looking forward to learning what telescopes are popular with beginners."
3,could be better,"its good for look at objects, but if you touch it just a little bit it bounces around like a jack rabbit on steriods"
2,Too small and wobbly to be useful,"This scope has two critical flaws:1. The 50mm (2"") objective is too small to be useful. You'd be better off getting a pair of 7x50 binoculars.2. The mount is unsuitable for astronomy use. It's far too wobbly, and the design, which puts the center of mass far above the pivot, makes it impossible to track objects.There are two far better choices in a beginner's telescope that are not only more stable and have a bigger objective- they're cheaper, too! One is theCelestron 21024 FirstScope Telescope, which is currently under $30. Another is theFunScope 76mm Tabletop Reflector Telescopefor under $40. Both are more rugged, easier to use, have more light gathering power, and will provide much more satisfaction and enjoyment for the beginning astronomer."
1,poorly made... flimsy,This is a terrible product. Its poorly made and very flimsy. The base is worthless. Stay away from this product. Its a waste of money.
5,"Not the Hubble, but it is for a grandson!","People tear it down, but what do you expect! Minutes to assemble and minutes to sight in. I know it will be out of alignment 5 minutes into using it, but he will get a great look at the craters on he moon! He will love it!"
5,CELESTRON Powerseeker 50 Refractor Telescope,Purchased for my son's birthday. He was thrilled with it.........it was exactly what he was hoping for. It arrived quickly in perfect condition and I was THRILLED with the price..........such high quality for so little. Thank you!!
4,Good starter telescope,Good Product for a starter. Was able to see Moon and craters. arrived fast and easy to set up. A+
4,Excelent product for a beginner,"Its a good telescope if you never had one, this is my first telescope an i can see the moon very close to see craters in high definition.....also I pointed to the other side of the city (like 12 Km) and i read easily the Burger king advertising!!!!"
2,Its OK for kids but you get the feel of real telescope,Takes time to adjust and focus on any object.the moon looks near but cant really makeout the surface/details.and the near by start just looks big and bright but cant see any furhter details.for little more price go for good one.
3,ok for the price,first the instructions came in multiple languages and it took forever to find the one in english. the stand is not sturdy at all. no matter how hard me and others have tried we can't get the little scope lined up with the big one every time u tighten the screws it moves. when it is windy it moves around so much it is impossible to focus on anything. i have had trouble seeing much of anything besides the moon and when i try to use the other lenses sometimes i can't even see anything out of them. if u have a lot of patience and looking for something basic and cheap this works but i wish i had put a few more dollars into getting something better.
4,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE TELESCOPE,"MY DAUGHTER LOVES THE TELESCOPE.I gave it as a Christmas present, is somewhat complicated to see stars, the tripod is very unstable, the moon looks spectacular. The only downside is the tripod that makes you lose focus.THE PRICE IS VERY GOOD AND FAST SHIPPING"
3,Opening a Vegas Sky,"Well I have not seen much with the product which is not all due to the telescope. I view the sky through a wobbly canopy in an apartment complex that is with the meddling of a incompetent security guard pacing back and forth. This is all while asking me about taking pictures and empty references of Yosemite and skydiving. Here in Vegas, you must have a balcony or field to try to view anything. One night under the canopy I observed the big bright moon jump out at me. Seeming a little like I was traversing 2 or 3 ft above the sand.I tried to point it at Venus, which is easy to spot even with all the city light. When I tried to see Saturn, It became a small rounded color-filled ball. Until I can move in September and also grab my wifes 114mm Celestron from the midwest, I am tasty pasta without the sauce. It is only $40; try it!"
5,Saved the World,"I bought this telescope so my daughter could look at the moon and babysit herself while I went out at night dressed as a super hero to bust hoodlums in our neighborhood. Last night I found my arch nemesis, Cpt. Spaghetti, robbing the local retirement home. He was able to elude me and escape in his custom, gold-plated helicopter.I rushed home and used my daughter's telescope to look at the helicopter's license plate. This thing is so powerful I could see Cpt. Spaghetti's twisted smile as he flew off.After getting his plate number I tracked the helicopter's IP address with a GUI I created in Visual BASIC. Needless to say, me and the Cyber Police were waiting for Cpt. Spaghetti when his bird touched down. All of the stolen dentures and adult diapers were returned to their rightful owners at the retirement home.This telescope saved lives that night, and I'm sure it won't be the last time."
4,Good value telescope for a beginner young adult or child,"You can't beat the price on this simple beginner telescope. And the Celestron company has an impeccable reputation. The optics of this scope are excellent and that counts for a lot. The mount is a bit shaky where the scope attaches to the tripod but the tripod itself is sturdy.So I recommend you use this on stable ground, not on a deck.Viewing through it is pretty good. I can see good definition of craters on the moon, the mid band of jupiter and the jovian satellites. Some of the more popular night sky objects such as m13 and m31 are also pretty well viewed.Good gift for a child and a good value. WIth something like this though you have to get yourself a book too. You don't want to just take it outside and start looking around. There are a lot of things out there and you need a map or book to tell you where they are."
5,One of the Best Collections I Have ever Seen,"This is one of the best copulations I have ever heard or seen. Carmen is electrifing and so passionate about praising God. You can't help but tap your soul with his profound stylings. God is truely working through him to reach the million of people that each song styling reaches. As an artist, Carmen has reached all facets of the musical realm. Everything from rap to country is on this album which makes it truely for the whole family. As for me and mine we will buy it and enjoy it. Keep up the great work for God."
2,Too Salty and sooty,"I just tried the hickory bacon and was very disappointed with how salty and overly smoked it tasted. Each slice has 250 mg of sodium..that's 1/4 teaspoon, and the smoke was sooty and had a creosote-like flavor. I also got the maple and the honey and hope they're not as bad. I'm going to boil the hickory bacon to de-salinate it and hopefully temper the smoke. The cracklins are tasty but salty. I'm calling Father's about the hickory..maybe it's not their standard fare..if it is I won't repeat."
1,"sizes are not accurate, sizes run small","I am very disappointed. I bought this sock because it said that it could fit a size 16, but it did not fit my son's feet. Having to buy his footwear online is extremely difficult especially when you have to rely on the sizes being the right fit, not smaller in sizes than other stores or brands."
2,Worked well until it broke,"I used this press about 4-5 times during the 5 years I owned it. The cookie shapes came out well, but after a few uses, the plastic ring around the barrel cracked. This year that same plastic part broke entirely, making the press unusable-- a critical engineering materials defect. Like the other reviewer (Dec 2005), I too am now in the market for an all metal press."
1,Broke on First Use!,"After going thru 2 other cheaper cookie presses in about 7 years, I decided to splurge and get the one that was supposed to be a ""professional"" version. It certainly looked and felt sturdier, so I was optimistic, however the very first time I tried to use it, it broke. Although, most of the construction is metal (steel?) there ARE plastic pieces on it, and the main piece that pushes (ratches) the dough thru the cylinder is plastic - it cracked after only a single tray of cookies. The dough was NOT overly stiff, so there was no reason it should have cracked. I had to get my mother's 30+ year old cookie press (made of ALL metal) to finish the batch. It handled the job with no problem. I wish they made them like they used to."
3,"well, it was great . . but then","I bought this press about two years ago and was really impressed. It was so much easier to use then the Wilton press I had previously. The trigger function was a little smoother then the actual press. Well, here I am at Christmas again and the cookies I made this year cannot compare to previous years. Using the same recipe and procedure I have been using for years, I could not for the life of me get decent cookies past the first two or three presses. Then it wouldn't press the cookies at all and the disks kept slipping out of the slot and cracked and broke bacause they were thin plastic. . . going back to stainless and maybe someone other than Wilton. I have less than decent cookie shapes and one sore hand and arm from fighting this contraption."
1,Defective,"Sending this cookie press back. Wilton generally has good baking products. However, in this case the cookie dough would NOT feed through the press. When it did, it would Oozed out of the sides of the disc and the dough did not release or stick to the cookie sheet, as the cookie press I am replacing did. As a matter of fact the cookie press I am replacing was all metal, including cookie disks and never oozed out the sides. It was sturdy and you had to ""twist the handle"" to create cookie. Due to arthritis I wanted to replace with a ""trigger type"" cookie press and unfortunately made of plastic, it just did not work properly from the first and only batch made ... However, the dough DID work in my older press, so I know it was not the dough. Although the recipe for the spritz cookies on this cookie press was different than the older one I'm used to using. Yet it still did not work in any capacity. Waste of all the ingredients, time, money and efforts. Very disappointing."
1,2 thumbs down!,"I bought this cookie press because my Pampered chef one broke. My husbands favorite cookie is the spritz cookie. I tried to make him some spritz cookies for Christmas time and every time I put a disc in the press and started pushing the dough out the disc would pop out of the press and start shredding the plastic off the edge. I spent half my night trying to get it to work, with no luck."
4,"So far, so good for the price!","I purchased this cookie press on sale at AC Moore this weekend. My 6-year old son and I made our first batch of these last night. I must say, it is very easy to use. My son was able to do it himself, and he had a great time decorating. It took us about an hour, start to finish to make a batch of these. Some of the reviews mentioned that there were better recipes than the one that comes in the box, so I tried one from Betty Crocker. I must say, I was not blown away by the taste of the cookies. They were just OK, I think the recipe needs more sugar - they tasted awfully flour-y. I did find a few others that I am going to try. Overall - two thumbs up!"
1,Totally worthless,"I am new to working with a cookie press, so this review may be pertinent only for newbies. The press is very difficult to get cookie dough into and impossible not to have air pockets in the dough. About 1/3 of the cookies come out nicely pressed - the rest are a mess - useless and a waste of dough -0 not sure if this is because of air pockets in dough or dough sticking to bottom of press - or both. Wilton seems to have a good name and, generally, make good products. It seems strange they would put their name on this disaster - I wouldn't want my name on it!It holds very little dough - not even enough to fill up a single cookie sheet. This was a total waste of money."
3,a little mmm...,I usually use electric cookie gun ..but this one looks more strong. but I dont know how to use it properly.. i wil make cookies this weekend I will see how it works .. not bad but just soso
1,disappointed,After just a few uses one of the plastic disks cracked and was unusable. Very disappointing
1,IT'S NOT WORTH THE MONEY,I HAD READ ALLOT OF GOOD REVIEW ON THIS COOKIE PRESS. IT BROKE THE VERY FIRST TIME I USED IT. WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER ONE!! VERY VERY UNHAPPY WITH WILTON COOKIE PRO ULTRA 2 PRESS.IT WOULD BE A NICER COOKIE PRESS IF IT WAS MADE OUT OF STAINLESS STEEL.
1,Horrible,"I was very excited to start making Christmas cookies with my daughter, but when I made the first batch (per the instructions), the disc shot right out of the press leaving me with a pile of dough and a disc stuck on top! I tried all of the discs with the same result - they were pushed right out of the press too.I followed all instructions. Honest. Needless to say - this was returned to the store and I found a nice, vintage press on eBay that works like a charm!(I would have rated this zero stars if Amazon would have let me)"
1,Waste of money,"I have been able to use this press twice. The first time it was OK, the handle that you squeeze to press the dough wears on your hands after a few. Also had some issues with the design inserts popping out through the front of the press. The second time we used it we had the same issues except this time the plastic piece that pushes the dough out bent and made the press almost completely useless. Spend a little more and get an all metal press if you are interested in getting some value for your money."
2,Cookie press,The dough has to be too soft or else the cookie former pops out when pressed. Otherwise a fine tool.
1,Piece of plastic!,"I bought this, received it on a Tuesday, am trying to get Christmas cookies done on Thursday. First panful was beautiful, then the squeezing action on the trigger stopped. I had my old one for 15 years - this is an absolute junky piece of plastic & is going back!"
4,Cookie Press,I have not been able to use the cookie press as of yet. My friend has this product and is very satified and recommended to me. I am sure it will work well for me and I will be very satisfied.
2,"Cookie Press, Please","Bought it, used it, and not planning to use much more. Difficult in loading and pressing. Maybe with practice it would get better."
2,disks flex and dough squeezes out of sides of disk,"Tried this with some cracker style dough and although at room temperature, the black plastic disks are flexible enough that they bend and push out with leakage around the outside. This device may be ok for some light cookie doughs but not cracker dough or thicker doughs"
3,Great . . . except plastic dies crack/break.,"I really liked this press the first year I used it. I have had it for three years. I find the press itself extremely easy to use. If there's a sticking problem, it may be the dough you're trying to use. The problem is the dies. They are plastic and will break and crack with normal use. I wish Wilton would have simply charged a little more money and included steel dies. I guess I can continue to use this until they all crack."
3,It's just okay if....,"...you have plenty of time to re-do is shaped cookies. My press seems unevenly ratchet down-but only occasionally. This press can only handle soft dough-which is a problem because I use the standard old Betty Crocker spritz recipe which asks for the dough to be cold. With warmer dough, the cookies spread out more and don't look as tidy. I also seem to have a problem using this press on parchment. I'll re-review after I use this cookie gun more."
1,Chipping Disk Nightmare,I spent some extra money hoping for a great press. I was very disappointed. I have had no issues with my trigger and at first thought I would love this press. Then after a few trays my disks started flaking away into the dough. I had to keep a close eye out to make sure none of my cookie had any black flecks in them. I tried several different disks and had the same issue in time with all of them. I was extra careful to make sure I put it together right. After time the disks chip away so much they won't stay in the press anymore and just push right through. I was very disappointed in this product.
1,Pretty sucky,Well...this is the worst cookie press ever made. If you like plastic shavings in your cookie dough then this is this is the press for you. Certainly not grandma cookie style. This press ruined Christmas. Thanks cookie pro. At least we got a good laugh out of the product. boo hoo!
1,Don't bother!,This is NOT for serious bakers! I had used my old fashioned one for years. (all metal screw type) works fine but takes some muscle. This looked like it might make the job easier. After 5 batches the PLASTIC cookie forms cracked. What I got was a batch of deformed christmas trees! VERY UGLY can't give away as gifts which is my tradition. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,Good thing they take returns...,"I made the dough as instructed and even though it wasn't very thick, I couldn't get the cookie press to squeeze the dough out. A plastic part of the rachet mechanism broke before I even got one cookie made. Good thing I can send it back!"
2,Easy to use - but plasic discs brake!,"I purchased this product a couple of years ago & it was very easy to use [even with the arthritus in my hand]. *BUT* the plastic disc broke, causing the cookies to come out deformed! I thought it may have been my fault since I refrigerated my dough instead of using it at room temperature as the instructions indicated. Sooo ... since I couldn't find any replacement discs, I ordered a whole new cookie press this year & and this time I made sure my dough was at room temperature and very soft. However, the same thing happened -- the disc broke & my cookies came out deformed! Returned it & will be looking for a new cookie press with metal discs!"
5,stop looking !!,"I have made a lot of cookies over the years. I have owned this press for a couple of years now and every time I get it out to use it, I am impressed with how well and easy it works. It cleans up just as easily and goes in the dishwasher. If you are having sticking problems, it's your dough not the press - find another recipe or adjust recipe. If this press breaks, I will buy another and I would give it as a gift in a heartbeat. I love this press!!"
2,This cookie press has always been a problem.,"This is the second season with this press, it has never worked well. There were problems with the ratcheting from the get-go, a lot of the cookies came out too big, and depending on the disc used, they may not have come out at all. There were maybe 4-5 discs that would produce an adequate cookie. This year I had the same problems, and when reloading the tube at one point, I noticed that a piece of the arm that attaches it to the tube had cracked and broken off. I managed to squeeze out the last few cookies, but now after less than 2 complete uses it is useless. I will go with an all metal press next time."
1,AN AWKWARD PIECE OF JUNK,I bought this cookie press recently and only used it twice before deciding to return it. Both times the plastic disc popped out while pressing the cookie. I make sure the second time that my batter was not too thick or stiff thinking that may have been the cause. I also found the handle very awkward and at times had to squeeze it several times before the dough would come out.
2,"Worked a few times then broke. Buy metal, not plastic!","I was quite happy in the beginning because the price was right and it seemed to work. Used it for about 4 batches of cookies, then the plastic gave way and it just fell apart. Useless now. Definitely buying a metal one next."
5,good things come to those who are good,"this book is a great way to reform your mind and the ill conditioning that takes place in our country. We would all love2live a great world society of love and caring for one another and the secret is no mystery........it begins with ourselves. This book is a tool. One has the ability to use it for constructive cultivation or destructive ignorance. i wonder about the negativity in some reviews yet there is freedom to express and the power of truth does not need proof, it is complete in itself. This may not be the all encompassing book of tao, it is a good book for your spiritual being and in effect, your entire self."
5,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE,"I am the type of person to HATE perfumes. They're overpowering and too sweet; HOWEVER, this is an absolute winner in my book. I can't stop smelling myself! I thought initially it was too sweet for me, but as a couple of minutes wore on, the smell started working with my body heat and started smelling a little muskier mixed with in with mocha, cinnamon, and vanilla. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM."
1,Wrong Item,"I ordered Ralph Lauren HOT & received Ralph Lauren WILD, a huge mistake! I tried calling this company, never got a call back, also e mailed them & never got a response! I'm very disguisted about spending $50 on something that I didn't oreder or even get acknowledgement on. I received an e mail from Amazon confirming my purchase of HOT & also the packing slip from this company clearly stated Ralph Lauren HOT. Very unsatisfied"
1,Not real!,"Ralph Lauren Hot is the only perfume I wear, so of course I was disappointed to find out it was discontinued. I was ecstatic when I found it on here, so of course I ordered it. The perfume I was sent is NOT Ralph Lauren Hot. The bottle and the box say that it is but one smell and it is obvious it is not the same perfume!"
3,"It's MMW, but it's different.","This one may take a little getting used to. MMW's still has their hip hop style grooves, but now there is a lot more music in the mix. There are several guest on this album (including Marc Ribot) which make this album sounds busy at times. Though if you give it a few spins, it will grow on you."
4,Ricochets between innovation and monotony,"Thankfully, this release features more sonic experimentation from MMW and less endless grooving. Unfortunately, the explosive explorations of Chris Wood and John Medeski are hampered by Billy Martin's seeming refusal to do anything but play a funk-rock beat. I know they need to hold on to their Phish fan base, but this is ridiculous; Medeski's furious avant-garding needs to be accompanied by Elvin Jones-style polyrhythms, not the same funk drumming we've always heard. Granted, Martin brings a certain energy to the proceedings, but in my humble opinion he keeps Wood and Medeski from reaching a certain creative pinnacle."
4,For the Truest of Fans!,"MMW's latest album is as close to a live show as you're gonna get. Their roots dig deeper into the old school, improv jazz style than many people even realize. Sure, it's no Friday Afternoon in the Universe (which, I think, epitomized their sound), but The Dropper is where the truest old school fans will be kinda glad that those other folks don't know collective genius when they hear it, because the faint of heart don't deserve a sound so deep. The Blue Note has always been my favorite jazz label, and it's perfect that they signed on MMW. Great Work!"
2,WEAK ATTEPT,"MMW are a decent band, unfortunately the drums are very weak and I am starting to hear less and less fresh ideas. I would be more inclined to praise HOT BUTTERED SOUL anyday."
2,clanging pots and pans,"Nowhere near as good as their other albums. very dissonant, and not an ""... shaking testament to the power of the holy groove"" which is what I want to hear from MMW. Weird, yes, but hardly what I want to hear at the end of a rough day. Combustication is where it's at!"
4,It'll grow on you if you can dig experimentation,"I own all MMW's albums but Farmer's Reserve, and personally, I think with the exception of Tonic, The Dropper is probably most representative of them live. There's a lot of experimentation here, and while it isn't as groovy as Shackman or Combustication (those are two albums that everyone should have), it portrays their unique spacefunkjazz where it is right now. There are definitely some noisy points on the album, and I must admit I didn't ""get"" it the first time through, but I've been popping it into my CD player all the time now, listening to the most interesting jazz at the moment. If you're looking for something that really grooves, I recommend Scofield's AGoGo or MMW's Combustication and Shackman. But if you want to hear a group take the world and spin it with some crazy space funk and off-kilter beats before entrancing you with incredible keyboard work, check out this interesting experimentation that is The Dropper."
4,The Leaf That Never Fell,"I gave this book to my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas, and she wanted me to read it again and again. I believe that she responded to the language, the beautiful illustrations, and the magical element. As she grows older, I believe that she will ponder the issues raised - being different, missing a parent, and having hope. I highly recommend this book."
5,my mother's face is in this ham!,"I can't believe this, this whole country ham is the spitting image of my dear mum. It is extraordinary how much they resemble one another. She was also very salty. And made good sandwiches."
5,Baseball cap,The quality was great. It made a wonderful gift for a very dear friend who is serving our military and is a Redskins fan.
4,A Good Hat,"This hat is made well and looks nice. I do wish the Redskins logo was a bit lower on the front but it looks a bit higher than the picture. Also, this hat has a tall front more so than the picture lets on as well. Overall I like it but I don't love it."
2,Interview doesn't draw anything new out of Heinlein,"Robert Heinlein has always been a source of interesting ideas. I was disappointed that the interviewer asks a series of questions that draw nothing more out of Mr. Heinlein than repetition of statements he has already made in his novels.The other thing every Heinlein fan wonders is how much the real life Heinlein was like the heroic characters in his novels. Since Heinlein was pretty adamant about protecting his privacy, the interview doesn't provide much insight into his personality, either"
5,A Must For Heinlein Fans,"A superb interview plus fine reviews. Mrs. Heinlein is right. This interview is done with intelligence and intellectuality combined with a deep knowledge of and love for the subject (RAH's oeuvre and by implication RAH). It is an interview worthy of Heinlein, whose depth of thought is underappreciated. It was a great pleasure to read."
1,Truly awful. More about Schulman than Heinlein,"As some one who's read just about every word Heinlein has ever written (Ginny just won't let me have the grocery lists!) I absolutely had to have this book. Unfortunately, Schulman is more interested in discussing his political views than truly telling us about this great writer. There is nothing here that is not better told in other of Heinlein's books. If (like me) you MUST read it download it from pulpless.com for free. If you want to learn more about Heinlein look instead to ""Take Back Your Government"", ""Expanded Universe"" or ""Tramp Royale"" If you want to learn more about Libertarian politics Harry Browne's books give much more information and better supporting arguments."
1,Not much insight on Heinlein,Not recommended unless you are interested in hearing Schulman expound on the virtues of libertarianism. You'll learn more about Heinlein from Expanded Universe and Grumbles from the Grave.
5,Flashin' Red by The Esquires,"The Esquires started out playing surf music but eventually became a strong vocal group. In 2009 some silent films of the group were submitted for a documentaty on ""surf music"" and several books tell their story. Surfin' Guitars,Surf Music from the Sities is one. This album captures their crude beginning but who thought anyone would care about surf music so many years later. Glad to see so much of it is being preserved on CD and DVD."
2,.,I expected a less funny version of Apathy and Other Small Victories but I didn't expect it to be SO less funny.
2,"Interesting concept, but undeveloped, and very poor writing","I found this book in a bookstore, read what was on the back cover and found it an interesting concept. Having some extra money, I decided to take a chance and purchase it. The characters are undeveloped and boring, the attempts at humor are not amusing, the so-called eloquence is contrived and pompous, the dialog is just poor and the ""paradoxes"" are little (if any) more than blatant contradictions with no purpose behind them. Still, there is an interesting concept, and the book occasionally has its moments, but overall the entire work is very shallow."
3,Not what I expected,"*Spoiler alert*When I read that this book was an international cult phenomenon I thought it might be worth a few hours of my time. Admittingly, I am/was (I've moved on now) a bit dissapointed. Yes, the story is witty and humorous. Yes, the story tries to make a point about intelligent, unique indivduals living in a society that values luck and mediocrity. And yes, the story has interesting characters and is fairly quick-paced. But, the whole time I felt like the book was moving toward this epic conclusion and a really fabulous explanation of...something...but a ghost and a bizzare chicken ritual and he's...better? Did I miss something? So, what? He spends the rest of his time as a ghost? (shaking my head) I guess I just don't see the brilliance behind the story."
2,"good idea, lame finale","This could have been a really good book, humorously tackling serious issues in modern society, and in particular the role of intelligence in social living. The premise is good: the main character begins to realize that he thinks too much about everything, thereby making himself miserable and incapable of enjoying life. He attempts a couple of solutions that don't work (alcoholism and suicide) before hitting on the right one: just take ""Happyzac"" pills and become purposefully stupid. But the author really ruins it in the finale (I won't tell), which not only develops much too quickly to be credible, but relies on the oldest and most lame trick in the writer's bag. Oh well, next time, perhaps."
1,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read,"I infrequently write Amazon reviews, but I felt it was important to caution other readers to avoid this book. The other reviews posted here are shockingly positive as the book is quite terrible.At essence, this reads like a college student's writing project, an essay that is the stream-of-consciousness outpouring of an immature writer. The book needs serious editing. The writing drifts, the characters are poorly developed, and the book is chock full of sloppy contradictions. (The main character is so moral he cannot eat fast food, but has no problem stealing from grocery stores?)The essence of the book is about the intellectual in society, but even this is poorly developed and weakly defined. Somehow intellectualism includes moral behavior, introspection, intelligence, and opposition to consumerism, but not rationality?I have thought about what I could say about the book that is positive. Perhaps that at eleven cents for a used version, it is cheap."
2,How I became stupid,"This was a selection for a book club I attend. It is an easy book to read and parts made me laugh. I think the author's title is a bit tongue in check because the main character demonstrates his stupidity in his attempt to become stupid. The book club discussion was lively, but brief."
3,"An interesting book, but it falls a bit short.","The book's main character, a 25 year old Frenchman named Antoine has a big problem - he's too smart for his own good. Antoine is always analyzing things over and over, always over thinking things, and miserable because he cannot turn that magical switch off that is responsible for his brain being on overdrive half the time. The main character then proceeds to go on a comic run of being ""stupid"" to solve this problem and tries many things such as becoming an alcoholic, trying prescription drugs, and even throwing money at his problems.I got this book from my sister and it looked pretty funny just based on the title and the book description, but I just didn't see it as being that funny and somewhat of a let-down for satire books. Maybe I'm a bit biased from my perspective as a sci-fi reader, but this book just didn't appeal that much to me. However, if you can get it at a price below the $10 listed on Amazon, it's a enjoyable enough afternoon read.-Travis"
4,Perfect gift for disaffected grad students,"This small book is a dazzling journey from the hallowed halls of academic life, wherein the main character is somewhat chronically depressed, to the bright, shiny corporate world outside (where he is breifly less depressed). Although the book does not resolve the Big Questions of existence that it brings up,I'm not sure that resolution is the point here. Page makes a brilliantly foray into the long literary conversation about the true meaning of happiness, joy, and the pursuit of knowledge. It makes a highly entertaining, smart afternoon read."
3,How to have a stupid ending,"This book was almost too clever with friends named Aas (who can only speak in poetry and glows in the dark) and Ganja (who always has some ""herbal"" remedy""). Still I was enjoying it until the ending which left a lot to be desired. The trip was more enjoyable than the destination. It was translated from French so maybe it's a French thing and I just don't get it."
2,THIS DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL,"This is supposedly an international best seller, but it didn't work for me at all. Perhaps I am too old for it.After attempting to become an alcoholic and a suicide, our hero decides to become ""stupid"" to help adjust to modern life. The plot that happens after this is predictable and the ending comes out of nowhere almost as a deus ex machina (which the author, in his introductory chapter,promises will not happen.) Sorry, but I'd suggest skipping this one."
4,Some assembly required,"This is pretty basic as adjustable measures go. It is fairly accurate to, within + o r - 2 grains if you're careful. The hardest part was getting it together. The brass plunger needs to screw on to the marked measure bar, and for that it has to be lined up perfectly inside the tube. This is not as easy as it sounds. However, once done, the rest is easy. It also doesn't cover which screw goes where (ther are 2), and they are not interchangable. I would suggest the manufacturer either assemble it before packaging, or include instructions. Other than that, it is a very well made measure."
4,powder measure,It's easy to use. It also came reasonably fast. I like the way the measure adjusts and the way it goes into the barrel.
4,"Good, but worth the money?","I have had this exact kit for a few years now and have only used it once. After using it I realized you are much better off just buying a winch, these things take too much time and effort."
2,let me down in a big way,"To quote another reviewer: ""let me down in a big way""I had this kit and a 60"" jack. Burried the front end of my truck in a mud hole and couldn't get to the winch - I'm thinking ""No problem, there's a tree right behind me, I'll just grab the hi-lift and the chains and pull myself back a few yards."" Only to find out what others have found out - the bolt holes don't line up well enough to get the thing assembled in the field without some significant 'pre-assembly'.YMMV, but the gloves are useless too. Do yourself a favor and make your own kit out of chain, D-links and hooks from Northern Tool."
2,Make your own kit better and cheaper,"You would be better off going to the hardware store and buying your own D-rings, chains and hooks. Be cheaper and better quality. This kit is just confusing also."
4,Very useful but not all you need,"I like this kit. I think it is very useful. It would probably be better to buy a winch. I got this kit for Christmas because I don't have a winch. Even if I get a winch I will probably still cary this because i have been stuck and had winches not pull me out. Anything you can get helps! Also, they don't tell you, but you need at least about 20 feet of chain and as many tow straps as possible. Also, the parts bolt onto the jack, but its not like they need to be tight or anything, the bolts just keep it from slipping off the jack. So to save time, I replaced the bolts with pins which is a lot nicer. A good buy though."
4,A nice listen,"For lovers of exotica lounge, this is really a treat. No bird calls or sound effects, but it creates a mood similar to Martin Denny all the same. Dresnin was top of his game when he threw his hand in for this little exotica lounge treat, and it has placed him in the company of Denny or Baxter as far as Exotica fans are concerned. Apparently quite a rare album before its re-release, so its good to see its available these days. A must for cheesy exotica fans everywhere. Quite a treat, perfect for your tiki bar - just make a Mai Tai and settle in!"
3,VOODOO LOUNGE,"Exotica lounge music by musician-composer Robert Drasnin (piccolo), who used to be Director of Music for CBS Television. This reissue of an obscure record album, created when 'bachelor pad music' was a successful musical genre, has an eerie, other-worldly quality, like a 'Night of The Iguana' tropical resort complete with voodoo glow skulls, flaming torches and forbidden love on a moonlit beach."
3,"great album, but sounds as taken from an LP","I think this isa great album, but mine sounds as taken from a LP...I hear a lot of scratches and tickles. does everybody have that experience?"
2,Another dissatisfied customer,"Oh if I had only seen the reviews by Flipping Homes and Scott Wyland a year ago! I'm just now discovering the exact same situation. Complete blockage after several months of ever slowing drainage.2 DAYS LATER: I FOUND THE SOLUTION! LITERALLY. IT'S CALLED 'SEW CLEAN' A URIC CRYSTAL BUILDUP CLEANER.. GOT IT FROM MYSTIC MARINE - ONLINE BOATINGSTORE. MIXED IT UP, POURED IT IN AND .....VOILA!! IT CLEARED ALMOST INSTANTLY!!!!"
2,Let Down,"I feel that this project is a let down compare to where this ministry was going. What's up with the members of the group? It appears to be getting smaller and smaller. It really looks like this artist is heading in another direction. I thinks the label, management team, the artist has lost focus on what the ministry is about. There were a few good songs on this project. I feel that the last project did not have time to mature. Maybe the label should had thought about doing a video and pushing some of the other great tunes on the last project before coming out so fast with a rushed up project. Lamar, please get back to you DAVID days. DO NOT change for the world."
3,Joe Nichols Early Years,Joe is great but this first CD is not the quality we are used to in his music today.
3,needs more,"The book has beautiful photos and, overall, I like the style and format. I did, however, expect a much thicker book for $50.00. There should also be an audio component (CD) for this price. I would rather see fewer photos and more text and an audio.I would also like to see a book similar in format but geared in topics to adult learners."
3,OUTDATED - But still not bad at all,"I liked this book, Dr. Heller seems to have a lot of experience in the treatment of BPD. The book is easy to read and follow, and I found it pretty interesting. HOWEVER, the book is really nt up-to-date with the recent medical and psychological research. It is claimed that the book has been updated in 1999. I dno't believe it. Nothing to say about DBT, newer SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics.If you just want to understand the disorder, get this book. If you are looking for treatment, this book is way out of date,"
4,stone cold classic punk from da seventies,"Why do the Clash and the Pistols get all da recognition? This debut by Richard Hell and the Voidoids is better than the debuts of the aforementioned two. Robert Quine is one of my favorite guitarists. Second guitarist Ivan Julian played in the early seventies R&B group The Foundations (famous for their hit Build Me A Buttercup)Good songs on here are Down At The Rock N Roll Club, New Pleasure, Blank Generation, and Betrayal Takes Two. Bob Quine would later go to play with Lou Reed and Matthew Sweet."
4,First Generations: Women in Colonial America,"First Generations: Women in Colonial America - So far I have only completed the first two chapters, but I found it to be very interesting."
4,Not a travelogue but a collection of essays,"A travelogue is a book that describes the journey to a place. This is not such a book. The chapters vary from one chapter to another, be it a small town in Indiana to another town in Texas or North Carolina or New Jersey. Singer focuses on certain people and the places the people find themselves in, taking on contemporary topics like religion, unsolved murders, guns or dog fighters. Well-written and witty, this is still a good read."
3,Somewhere in challenging journalism,"Occasionally one can manage a reasonable find in the bargain bin. Not here.The author, at the time, was a well respected writer for The New Yorker and this is a compilation of various articles from him during the early part of this century.I found the chapter topics very interesting but the overall writing style seemed disjointed and lacking coherence. Just didn't seem to flow. Which is too bad, because in the right hands this could have been an entertaining and informative read."
5,Superbly Written,"A rich and fascinating account of Puerto Rican life and history. The author writes with flow and insight into a country's story that spans generations. I'm proud to have this in my collection, perfect for anyone enraptured with history and foreign study, like myself."
5,Adorable!,"I love that they've combined 4 of the McDuff stories under one cover. This is a great gift for a child who does not have any McDuff books. The illustrations are gorgeous and right on the mark as far as capturing the Westie personality. My children love the McDuff tales almost as much as they love their own Westie, Auggie."
5,Love McDuff,"Combines four books into one. How McDuff finds a home, the new baby, McDuff and Santa, and McDuff's wild romp."
2,Just didn't fit right.,"I'm 5'4"" 130 pounds and the pants just didn't fit right on me.I have a 28"" waist and a BOOTAY that is pleasant to see...not fat.The waist on these was too big / by an inch... the butt had wrinkles... but the small would have been too tight on the legs...I'm muscular. I'm a long distance biker --- and went with a different brand instead. Canari (or something like that). Hmmm. Returned these."
3,You get what you pay for,"Pros:InexpensiveGood long lengthNo chaffingAdequate paddingCons:Not holding up well to wash and wearNot particularly flatteringI got two pairs of these about a month and a half ago and ride on average 10 miles a day. I wash them in cold water and hang dry them. They are starting to fray a bit at the seams around the padding. They are not the most flattering with the shiny spandex material and they pinch some at the elastic at the thighs.Overall, I will wear these until they die and I would suggest them to anyone who isn't sure they want to cycle enough to warrant padded shorts but I will not buy them again."
3,Disappointing,"This is the kind of album that probably generates the stereotype of free jazz as under-rehearsed, disorganized chaos. It's a shame, because you can clearly hear that Larry Young had something interesting to say in the free jazz idiom - but apparently these musicians were not the ones to do it. There's little of the overarching genius you hear on Coltrane, Cherry, Taylor or Sun Ra recordings from the same period. The horn soloists are generally not interesting and the two-drummer combination is diffuse rather than powerful.Despite my harsh criticism above, there's still some great music here - particularly when Larry is soloing. Larry Young fans probably want to hear this, but those expecting something on the level of Unity or Mother Ship will be disappointed."
2,Dissapointing,"I loved Unity and also am fond of Into Something. I had high hopes for this and was anxious for the reissue. This is a lot of avant garde doodling. There is none of the musicianship of Unity. Unless you really like latter period Larry Young, don't buy this one."
2,Same information... different covers on her books...,"If you have read any one book of lillian , you will notice same stuff is written in her other 20 books. Well .. now pay for different cover but don't expect any new information in this book. I have seen her over 8 books sharing same information ..over and over and over..."
5,Nine West Gaffer Pump - An Excellent Shoe,Love this shoe. Great for every day or dress. Comfortable but elegant. This style runs a little larger than other Nine West pumps. Most all my Nine West pumps and heels are a size 6.5. This one I had to go to a size 6 because the 6.5 was just too loose fitting.
3,Uncomfortable,"I love Nine West shoes, have about 15 pairs and I thought I knew what size I was for sure but these run VERY narrow, even for me and I have narrow feet. Not sure whose feet would fit into these. The toe box and heel are fine, they're narrow on the sides where my feet were hanging out, not attractive and just plain painful.Love the color and the price, was disappointed that they were just too uncomfortable to keep, had to send them back...: ("
5,Nine West Gaffer Pump,Smart well-constructed shoe. The high heel is both chic and comfortable. I purchased this shoe for less than $35. It was a great purchase all the way around.
2,Too large to fit,Liked the look but was a bit large. Had to send it back as it slipped on my foot. Got it on a super sale that didn't apply for the next size down so didn't get it.
2,Scattered!,"The music here is just all over the place. Loud, jazzy. Almost like ska! Good if you like music fast and schizophrenic!"
4,Great pantry,"I have two of these units for storing canned foodstuffs in. I generally like them, although they do have a few disadvantages. First, they tend to be a bit unbalanced. If the cabinet is empty and you open both doors, it will tip forward. Second, like other units in this product line, the plastic handles have a tendency to strip out where the screws hold them to the door. Finally, they weigh a bit, so they are a bit awkward to move around.<br /><br />I don't need more than the two I have or I'd get more."
2,Storage cabinet,The cabinet was delivered promptly. One of the doors did not have predrilled holes. A hinge broke during assembly. The rest of the cabinet is sturdy and usable.
5,I love these,"Easy to put together, doesn't cost alot on Amazon. I have food and dishes in one and books in another. Shelves are pretty sturdy. Great for storing food, dishes, towels, books or just about anything else that you can think of. No problems on my end at all. Very happy with it and plan to buy more."
3,Some problems...,"The Brain Games was disappointing in a couple of ways. The word search it has is very flawed...that was the activity I was looking forward to the most! I am great at finding ""words within words"" but this is the silliest, most impossible thing to do with this product. It recognizes nonsense words, yet won't recognize common two letter words. I relooked at the instructions several times to see if I was doing something wrong. And yes - I agree with an earlier reviewer about the adult nature of the words...even was presented with ""Porno""!In the Flashcard section, you have to rely on a very small row of numbers to do the activity - it is really hard for my 47 year old eyes to see them.So just don't expect something wonderful with this game...read the other reviews."
3,Inappropriate words!,"I bought this game for my kids because I had heard good things about it. It is too difficult for my 9 year old son. When my 10 1/2 year old daughter played it she got to the Word Hunt and was given the dirty word ""*itch"" and it wasn't witch. I called the company and they just want me to send it back and they'll give me a voucher for a new one! I enjoy playing it, but who knows what other words are going to come up. Definitely inappropriate for children."
1,I will be returning,It was only painted on one side and it was not the side that would be visible.And more importantly it would not fit my glasses. The base on my glasses was too wide; the only ones that do fit are the small ones you get for wine sampling.
1,really bad product,"I can not fit ANY of my glasses, don't even the small champagne glasses!A waste of money!Will be helpfull if amazon post the actual dimentions of the openings for the glasses, not only the overall dimentions."
3,Decent...,"This item does what it needs to do, just isn't the most sturdy thing ever. The metal is stedfast, but the pieces are glued together instead of welded. Overall, i would say that it is a ""decent"" product, especially for the price."
3,"Kinda crappy, but it sorta works if you have thin stemmed glasses","It kinda works, it's just only good for thin stemmed wine glasses or wine glasses with a small heads. Oh well, I mean if you are looking for a discrete way to hide your wine glasses this it. Just make sure you are only planning to put the standard sized glasses in here. Also the glasses tend to clank into each other a bunch the metal isn't that sturdy and will flex with alot of glasses put on it. Maybe this won't happen with Crystal glasses?"
5,TRUE Smooth Jazz!,"Smooth Jazz as it was INTENDED to be. Not R&B-in-disguise, and not the cookie-cutter, elevator-bound, formulaic swill that has passed for SJ in recent years. Virtuoso writing and performances by all 4 members. Foot-tapping jams and sweet ballads alike on ""New Pants"". Flim & the BBs' best work came in the DMP days (before this album), but this and all of their works are highly recommended. Would LOVE to see these guys get back together with Tom Jung for a reunion album!!"
3,The bed from Lilliput!,The product itself is ok. it's light and sleek. I under over estimated the fold out length. I thought it was longer.
2,Big Price..tiny sofa,"Based upon the photo, I thought my 9 year old would fit on the ""Sleeper Twin"" comfortably. I should have reviewed the product specs better before purchasing. My son is average height...but this thing is super TINY. For children five and under, it would be fine I guess. In my opinion the $100 price is way too much for what you get; I would really suggest just getting a nice beanbag chair for 1/4 the price."
2,Studio Chair...too hard,"I recently purchased the Chidren's Studio Chair Sleeper. The design is great, and it is very practical for when my son has a friend sleep over. The only problem is the foam is much too hard/stiff to make a comfortable bed. Twice I've had kids say that they thought it wasn't any more comfortable than sleeping on the floor. I guess it was appropriate that I bought a red one, because it is very similar to sleeping on a brick. I wouldn't recommend the chair to anyone who was planning on using it as a sleep surface for kids."
4,Child's Sleeper,"Contrary to some previous reviews, this has worked just fine for our 3 yr old grandson, who plays on it during the day, and sleeps on it at night."
3,Toddler sized,"We bought this for our 4 year old niece to sleep on during a two week visit. While the quality seems good, it is very small it is working for us but barely she is small for her age but this is barely long enough."
2,Children's Studio Chair Sleeper,"This product is not as soft as we imagined. We were thinking kind of squishy memory foam but this is really REALLY firm. Still, my grandson (who is 8) piles a couple blankets on it and sleeps there.Thats about it.:-)"
2,Not good for sleeping on unless you like sleeping on a rock!,"I bought this for my 4 yr old granddaughter's bedroom to use when she has sleepovers. It has a really cute appearance as a chair with the pink back ground and flowered print, but it is supper hard and feels like your sitting on a board. It doesn't feel like there is any foam in it at all. I tried laying on it an it was hard as a rock. It would be more comfortable for the kids to sleep on the floor on a sleeping bag."
3,ehhh,"Well this is a cute little couch but it's not very comfortable. I also wished that they had told the dimensions of the couch when it is folded out it wasn't quite as long as I had hoped.It's a good couch/sleeper for a child from the age of 2-4, my daughter is four and she will probably not be able to sleep on it in like six more months. So yeah there it is!"
2,So uncomfortable,"We bought this chair last December for Christmas for our son to have a spare bed for sleepovers. This thing was and still is so hard! It is so uncomfortable, even for little kids! Pratical to use it as a chair, and have a handy bed when needed, but I always feel pretty bad to let any kid sleep on it. Disappointing!"
1,Twin is not the size at all!,"This chair that supposedly turns into a sleeper is ridiculous! It is 38"" wide and when you roll it out to sleep on it, it is definitely not a twin sleeper, my 7 year old son was too long for it. Might be good for a 4 year old, but not for anyone else. I do not recommend this product."
1,Dishonest Advertising,The item is not what was pictured or described this is a toddlers toy sofa.Measurements are not accurate DO NOT PURCHASE UNLESS YOU WANT A CHILD PLAY SOFA.
3,"Not an ""eleventh hour"" how-to","honestly, if you are halfway through a curved handrail at sort of a sticky point and think ""I'll order this book, it looks like it might help"", well, you are probably wrong.Lots of info, like a lot of the other stair books, but not put together in a way that will be useful in the short term. I'd say it's more like a text book. Also the term ""Simplified"" in the title...I guess if you are Stephen Hawking, then perhaps. But why would Stephen Hawkings want a book about building stairs?A lot to get your head around, not going to help you out of a bind, unless your bind is something like ""how do I find the vertex locations of a rake-to-level section"""
5,Great puppet,"Puppet is soft, bright colored and easy to use. My 90 year old mother used it to entertain 7 month old great grandchild. They both had great fun."
4,Is there a Monster at the End of This Review?...Ask Grover!,"I purchased this to make story time even more entertaining for my four kids (8, 5, 3, and 1). Since Elmo, Oscar the Grouch, and The Doors albums are banned from our house Grover was a natural fit. He is durable, furry, lovable, and fun. Be aware, Grover loves to bite noses (something Sesame St producers never show you in the series) and he also likes to sing when Mommy isn't looking.This is a high-quality item that I would purchase again, and that's not because I don't have any real friends.Note: I don't have any real friends."
3,Good but difficult to use,"Its a good size, its nice and soft to touch, but its hard to puppet it. The mouth doesn't move easily and I could only operate one arm at a time. I might have purchased another puppet that was easier to use."
3,good old violent 80's action trash,"Filmed in Belize, not anywhere near Africa, this brutal story about a bunch of mercenaries moves right along. Walken is as good as ever in the pedestrian scritped adaptation of the Forsythe novel. One of the most violent flicks I have ever seen. A really ruthless tone to the whole thing. Oh yeah the revolving grenade launcher that Chris sports is boss."
3,The Dogs of War,"I am a big fan of Christopher Walken. However this movie was almost averbatim remake of ""The Wild Geese"" from a few years before. I wouldnot recommend this movie as a purchase item to anyone else, but itwould be nice to rent ""both"" DVD's. Then anyone could make an informedchoice as to whether to purchase either,or both movies."
1,Wild geese fan,This Movie isn't worth wasting your time watching. As far as tactics I did not see any and I spent six years in the Army one in Viet Nam. This movie can't even compare to to the tactic's in the wild geese. I wish I hadn't spent the money.
4,Well Crafted Mercenary Tale,"This is a well crafted story about the otherthrowing of a brutal West African dictatorship through a mercenary run coup d'tat. The film meticulously follows the plot from the reconesance operation to the planning stages through the actual coup. Christopher Walken plays Shannon, the leader of the mercenaries. Walken does solid, but not remarkable work here but he cannot be faulted for that. The film is more concerned with the nuts and bolts of the story and not so with characterization. Shannon's personal life is dealt with perfunctorily, such as his failed marriage, but is quickly dropped. A major character dies in battle but the audience can't really feel for him because we never really got to know him. Covert ops and military hardware take precedence. Gotta love them Uzis and Gats. If you are looking for good storytelling with little or no emotional attachment to the characters this is the film for you."
3,Gripping story about an African coup d'etat. Good entertainment.,"This film is (loosely) based upon the novel of the same name by Frederick Forsyth. Christopher Walken plays mercenary Shannon, who is employed by a Western mining company to stage a coup d'etat against the brutal dictator of a poor West African country. Walken turns in a good and believable performance that highlights is not-inconsiderable talent.This story is only loosely based upon the Forsyth novel. Almost all of the storyline is different from the novel, although the main theme, the staging of the coup, is still the central axis of the story. The details are all different. No matter; this one holds the viewer's interest and is particularly engaging with its workmanlike portrayal of the details of planning and staging a coup. The action is very good. If this one had stayed closer to the novel's storyline I think that it would have been better, but that is just my opinion.A very watchable film. RJB"
4,Dogs of War,"Item arrived ahead of schedule and in excellent shape. One of my favorite movies, with a plot that reminds me so much of the 1950-60's Africa. Very good."
4,Cry Havoc...,"From start to finish, this is the kind of movie that most young actors would kill to star in; smart, with a good script and enough character actors to anchor the film firmly into your subconscious.I should admit I'm a huge Chris Walken fan from way back, so of course I'm biased, but if you watch the film carefully, you'll see that it warrants repeated viewings.If I have any complaints at all, it would be the video quality, which is why the DVD is a much better bet. Still budget priced, and due to its age, the movie doesn't have much in the way of extra features, but that doesn't detract from it one bit."
4,cleaning house,"this is quite a good mercenary movie,about cleaning up a corrupt country.pretty gritty,but a good story line,and lot's of action.and worth the money."
5,classic,One of Walken's early movies. Gives an insight into how things are run and manipulated in 3rd world countries (via Hollywood - or not?).
4,Colorado 16-foot-by-5-inch Triangle Sahpde Sail,"We hung this to keep the rainstorm of acorns from denting our car, so far, so good. The sail was easy to hang and to adjust."
5,Coolaroo!,"The Coolaroo is constructed of extremely durable fabric. It comes with metal hardware, minus screws. I am quite satisfied with the product and recommend it. The product was delivered as promised."
5,Awesome!,Our motel has 2 triangular shades that are beginning their third New Mexico summer.High winds and intense sunlight have done NO damage. I don't think you will find a better product no matter the price.
5,Great solution when you need shade,"I purchased these shades for my son who is covering a patio area. He has placed several shades and they do a marvelous job. They make an unusual looking solution for providing shade, and also allow a flow of air. Very smart looking. Amazon's price was the best that we could find online, as well."
3,Not much shade!,"The construction and materials in this Shade Sail are first rate. However, I was shocked at how small the shade area was when properly stretched. Don't go by the actual dimensions of the triangle sail when determining which size to purchase. When properly installed the shade area is much smaller than the sail's uninstalled dimensions."
3,Quality construction but too small,"The quality of this shade's construction is great - 5 stars. Really good hardware comes with it, too - 5 stars. Unfortunately, I had to return it because it was too small for the area I was trying to cover. The way the sides curve in just makes the actual shade shape too small. They should really publish a template or some way to give customers a true sense of the actual shade size - it is in no way a full triangle of 11' 10"" on the side. So it lost stars because of that."
1,Still in the box,"i don't really know how the product is. After reading more detailed information included with the product, it says not recommended for the pool because the clorine could effect/shorten the product life. It seems that the ad shows the coolaroo shade being used next to the pool. And that's what we bought it for. Not sure what to do with them now - still siting in the box next to the door gathering dust.... Oh, well. i'm sure its a great product, just not for us."
2,"Nice product, horrible shipping","The shade is okay, but the company sent the wrong item at first, and then took almost 6 weeks to make it right."
5,great sun shade,This sun shade not only blocks out unwanted hot sun...it also adds art and wonderful design to your patio area. I'm 100% satisfied with this magical piece of fabric!
3,Didn't work out..,"Wanted to create some shade on new auto..living in South Florida,the sun reallybeats up a paint job.. Anyway, as most awning/structures were too unatractive..pluswould not withstand wind storms..thought we would try the sail shade..However..no matter how we tried to configure..the actual shade area was so small, it was rendered useless. The triangle is cut on concave lines..probably to withstand wind, etc..but makes for small shadow.. We had to return the item.. Still have no good solution.Even though we ordered the 16.5 Ft shade; the first six or more feet on eachend are so thin..there is almost no shadow thrown..Product seemed of good quality, &the included hardware looked adequate. Would be nice if you had the room for multipleshades..overlapping.."
5,Attractive and effective!,"We have a large deck that gets too much sun during the summer months. The heat is unbearable at times and it's almost too bright to see. In search of a solution, short of installing a permanent canopy, we found the Coolaroo brand shade sails on Amazon. We purchased two of them: the 11'10"" and the 16'5"". It took a little work to figure out exactly where we wanted to mount them, but once in place, we could not be more pleased! The sails look fantastic. They are very high quality. They do a wonderful job of keeping temperatures more comfortable and lessening glare. We bought them in July 2010 and only recently took them down for the winter. This is another bonus: Since they're not permanent, we can put them up or take them down as the seasons change. Excellent product!"
5,Shade Sail,"Great quality and perfect sun filtering. Let's some light through so you don't feel you're in the dark under it, but not so much sun that you would get burned. The stainless steel mounting fittings are excellent."
2,Think twice before you roll the dice!,"Cool-aroo concept here, but needs much consideration before buying. I have a patio that is 16 X 27. I figured if I hung this thing about 9 to 10 feet about one side of it I would get about 33% shade. Well they fail to tell you that the sail is an acute triangle (although the picture looks slightly like it). The coverage is very poor and requires you to pair it up with another one or two; but then you have to sink more poles if you don't have other structures to attach to.So I gave it two stars based off the fact they try really hard to sell you the overall concept in one sail. Two or more is definitely needed.The quality of the product is good. The fabric seems really durable and they corner rings are strong.In the end, I returned it. It just wasn't for me; and didn't want to sink more poles off my patio."
5,Elements of Getting Comfortable,"As a long time admirer of art and a first time beginner of actually tapping my artistic well, this text is like having a private mentor guiding you through specific progressive exercises. It's language is quaint and cozy to modern ears, having first been written in 1856. But it is practical, clear and encouraging. It dispells the idea that only certain people can draw. And by focussing on drawing with pencil, it provides the foundation for using any other media. A wonderful find."
2,Limits to Drawing,"This is a wonderful classic, sometimes hilariously Victorian but full of good drawing advice. The problem is that this is a very peculiar reproduction in which most of the drawing examples have been left out. Occasionally they do appear but the reproduction value is terrible. So you get text only, while the text was supposed to be well illustrated."
2,tried to read several times but never been able to get through it,"I admire several of Ruskin's drawings, and can appreciate his standing in the ""art world"". However, for the most part I find his work lacking the ""big picture""; without a clear focus on important aspects of composition and order. His drawings seem to be very detailed (example: a side of a rocky mountain) without any clear focal point and only a vague sense of what the actual subject really is.I have the same problem with his book. I have tried to read this book several times but have never been able to get through it, and have walked away without any real gain, and not for a lack of trying. It might be good for others. I noticed that everyone else gave it 5 stars so I felt the need to give a balanced view."
1,"Almost all ANSI SQL, not worth the money","This book is pretty useless for a Teradata developer. It was basically the same as the Teradata documentation, just not as detailed. For beginners, the Tera-Tom on Teradata Basics is much better for a good high-level overview."
2,Was this a 6th grader's book report?,"How disappointing. I was eager to receive this book and as it only took about 45 minutes to read from front to back, I didn't put it down because I kept thinking that there had to be some redeeming value. Some useful tidbit of information that I as a person who has never catered anything could use. There was not one thing in this book that someone with common sense wouldn't think of themselves. There appears to be only one reason this book was written. The author had enjoyed being a caterer and when she left the field to raise her son, she needed money. I'm only sorry that she didn't put more effort and thought into it."
1,How to Start a Catering Business when you don't know what the hell you're doing,"There is no rating low enough - this book surely does not deserve even 1 star! Poorly written, double spaced, obviously not proofread...not a book I would have ever bought if I had been able to look at it in the store before buying."
3,perfect gift,this book is a pictorial history of italian-americans in america and was the perfect gift for my friend whose grandparents and parents came from Italy . He identifies with some of the photos and really is enjoying it.
2,Very Sad.,I remember this book from when I was a child. The sad illustrations and storyline would cause me to become teary-eyed. It was successful in getting the point across that it is very mean to tease fat kids. I always defended the chubby kids after reading this book. There is one picture in this book that became burned into my memory- of the cat eating a sandwitch with tears running down her face.I could cry just thinking about it!
3,Good but a little unrealistic,"The book was fun to read, but I found it hard to believe that a dog from an alien planet would look almost the exact same as a sheep dog. But if your looking for a book to read just for the fun og it this book is great."
5,The Best!!,"This is the best movie I have seen in a very, very long time! I don't understand why it was never put out on the big screen!!Patrick Stewart is a wonderful and talented actor and this movie brings out the very best in him. He transitions from believing someone is out to assassinate him to doubting what he truly believes to be right during the two hour movie. There is enough action, romance & comedy to please most folks and an easy to follow plot.Take a chance on this one - you will be pleased!"
4,Keeps you on your toes,"Not being a ""trekkie"" fan, I was a little skeptical to watch this thinking it would be just another ho-hum picture. Not so, it kept me wondering if this guy was for real or just another ""old-timer"" losing it.... The suspense kept you rivited wondering what next. It is action packed and for those with youngsters, yes, there are some violent scenes but for the adult, it is entertaining and a really good movie. After seeing this I was impressed enough to go out and buy the video.....that to me, is enough of an endorsement..."
3,Safe House Movie Review,The order was processed and shipped in a timely manner which was appreciated. We had seen this movie several times on Hallmark or other channels. The full DVD contains some scenes not included in the versions we saw but horrible language is also included in the DVD. That is why I gave the movie only 3 stars. Without the foul language the movie was terrific.
2,disappointed,"While I have always enjoyed watching Patrick Stewart's performances, I have never seen him in something where his use of profanity was extreme or where he did a nude scene. This was a top-notch thriller superbly acted and directed that needed none of the above to make it well worth watching. Sadly, it's fate was my garbage can."
2,Broken Piccolo,This piccolo was to be used by my daughter during marching season. She had it about a month and then it wouldn't play any more. It just stopped playing. This piccolo is junk.
3,too short - too much - too bad,"As the previous reviewer mentioned, this disc is way to short (20 minutes, including chats and applause), and I have a sneaky suspision that the actual show was split between this disc and ""By Popular Request"", another way-to-short album put out by the same folks.As always, the music is top-notch, but keep in mind, at the current list price, you're paying about 70 cents per listening minute."
2,No thanks,"I don't like this video. It is not professionally produced. The audio is poor, and the mix and match format doesn't work very well. There are 3 disks, but you can't program exercises from more than one disk, so you must use whatever programs are on that particular disk. The performers are okay, but not as motivating as Gilad or the Biggest Losers. The routines are repeated over to complete a 15 minute exercise, and are boring. There are so many better ones, that I may never use this one again."
2,average,"Good ideas! Each section starts out with a bible verse that helps her through her experiences. However, she gets off track quite easily by telling cute little stories."
1,Bad Buy,"This violin worked for about two months. I could not find a music store that would help with the pegs that would no longer tighten. The reason they wouldn't touch the violin is that it was so cheaply made. No one would work on it because it would break so easy. A purchase that was ""You get what you pay for."" Fortunately, my daughter had so much fun playing with it for a couple months that we ended up buying her a nicer one."
4,One of the best christian albums comming into the 2000 era,"Prime Minister have been in the rap game since the mid 80's. It's ""Inside Out"" that really put him on the map. With guest appearances from some of gospels biggest stars, ""Inside Out"" is one of many rap sensations put out by Grapetree Records before it collapsed."
2,Not that great,I purchased this book while doing a research paper on Paul for a grad school class. Not really a good book. Did not even use it as a source. Get the book on Paul by John Polhill instead.
2,Long Songs Make For Hitting for Next Song,"I love these artists individually (Chris Tomlin, Charlie Hall, Matt Redman, Watermark), but these songs are soooo long and drawn out that I found myself going to the next song each time. However, song number 5, ""Grace Flows Down"", sung by Christy Nockels, is a true gem that I listened to all the way through. Maybe I am a bit biased as I do not care for live albums, for reasons like long songs and random talking during the song. Maybe if I was at the Passion: One Day experience, I would have enjoyed it, but hearing someone sing ""We Fall Down"" in a different language does nothing for me. Also, this CD is in desperate need of David Crowder! Alright, let the negative comments ensue! I love Christian music and love these songs, but these versions will not be listened to again (except for song #5)."
5,Want a passion for Jesus?,"Then this CD is for you! I love it! and its even better if you have seen the video! This CD is the live version of a wonderful and exciting vision where thousands of uni students come together to worship and praise God! Its powerful, challenging and life changing! A definate for your collection (I have had mine for over a year and I am still playing it EVERY DAY!)"
5,WOW - What a praise sound!,"This is the best sound-engineered live praise & worship recording I have ever heard ... the integration of music, prayer, and scripture into an entire worship experience is representative of the awesome impact of Passion's oneday student conference. This is a highly-recommended alternative praise & worship recording."
1,shrill and unlistenable,"If you didn't already know this music was performed on ""the 1610 Essaias Compenius Organ at the Frederiksborg Castle"" in Denmark, there wouldn't be much on Amazon's page to warn you. I love Renaissance dance music, but on this album the tunes are rendered shrill and agonizing to listen to by the squawking, clacking, buzzing organ, which on some tracks sustains a single note throughout the entire track, sounding like an oven timer. This CD just arrived today. I listened to it once, will never listen to it again. A complete waste of money. I'm incredibly disappointed."
5,Lens Adaptor for Canon A630 Digital Camera,"This 52mm adaptor arrived very quickly in brand-new condition, and works precisely as expected and specified. I purchased 52mm filters locally, and have no problems. I am pleased with the transaction."
1,Not made for cycling shoes !!,Made the cycling shoe fit tight & did not offer any better comfort than was from the original . Back part of the sole is too thick which made the heel not fit right in the shoe .
1,Do not use with Gore-Tex lined boots,The description of this item does not make clear that it has a hard plastic edge with a sharp lip that can easily cut through Gore-tex or any shoe lining. This should be made clear in case someone is looking for an insole for a hiking boot.
3,Sent them back-wrong size,"They sent the wrong size and I sent them back. Purchased a pair of regular insoles that was supposed to conform to your feet (not from Amazon), and they didn't work. I need to get orthotics. Nothing else is going to work."
3,"Great product, but too pricey! Plus, there are those sharp edges","Great product, just too pricey. Should cost ~ $20. (Also, edges are a bit ""sharp"" so I wonder how my shoes will be in a month or two - will they tear the inside liner?)"
5,WOW These are amazing,"I suffer from Posterior Tibial Tendonitis and have been on the sidelines for a month. I can't afford custom made orthotics from the doctor's office, so I've been searching for an orthotic that works but is affordable.I got my Sole orthotics today and WOW! I put them in the oven and molded them to my feet and I am 100 percent pain free for the first time in a few months.I am getting ready for a run as we speak. I am amazed and delighted with these and if u suffer from foot problems, These are your orthotics."
3,Choked fireworks,"Good only in the moderately proportioned, middle-of-the-road context this once sparkling band represented, F&B sounded like the end of things, though they rebounded and bowed out with style after."
5,A fine Roxy album for the non-roxy fan,"The maturity of the band shows through in addition to a nod to thier roots by doing the covers of Midnight Hour and Eight Miles High. If you are not already a Roxy fan or you are and you'r indoctrinating some one who'es never heard of them this is the album to play. ""OH Yeah"" is my favorite cut and one that gives full expression to Ferry's vocal emotions."
3,Only good for one listen,"My friend has this and told me yesterday that the quality is terrible and he could only listen to it 1 time. The previous guy suggested buying this if you want to hear what the Dead Boys sound like. If you've never heard them, why would you start with a live album? Buy a studio one like Young Loud and Snottier."
3,Dead Boys - 'Twistin' On The Devil's Fork:Live At CBGB'S' (Bacchus) 3 1/2 stars,"Archived performance by the Dead Boys pulled from two of their earlier shows- Oct.2, 1977 and Aug.31, 1978. Sound quality isn't that great, but I think what I like SO much about 'Twistin'...' is that it sounds just so 'real' and raw.Might need to fiddle around with your stereo controls a bit. Twelve cuts here to fully experience what TRUE proto punk is all about. Tunes I liked best were ""All This And More"", ""Catholic Boy"", their cover of the Syndicate Of Sound's late '60's hit ""Hey Little Girl"", the gritty ""Aint Nothing To Do"" and ""What Love Is"". Enjoy."
3,they're okay,"I got these sandals after reading numerous reviews raving about them. I personally don't find them to be off the chart. They are bit stiff and even though there is a rough bottom to them, I feel like they are kind of slippery on some surfaces. They aren't completely uncomfortable but I've definitely owned more comfortable sandals for less money."
2,too loose!,"These are really nice looking flips..would give five stars for looks but they are very loose. I only wore once so I don't know if they will stretch out or wear well. You would need to have a very large, round foot or I received an anomaly."
2,Had to return...,"They looked good on paper, but when I received them I noticed that the white parts had a shimmer to them, which wasn't what I was looking for. Also ordered an 8, but needed a 9."
1,wrong,The wrong color was sent to the house. The picture showed one thing but that sure wasnt what we got. they seller blamed amazon. im not sure who is actually responsible.
4,Just got them,"I just got these and wore them around the house as it's winter outside...but for the brief time I wore them, they seems pretty comfortable. I have high arches, so I don't get a lot of the arch support, but maybe it's because they haven't had time to conform to my foot yet. They're cushy and the foot strap part is soft and stretchy which is very nice. I usually wear a size 9/10 so I ordered the 10 and they fit perfectly. I'm looking forward to wearing these all summer!"
4,NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS OTHERS I HAD,"NOT AS COMFORTABLE AS OTHERS I HAD, THE OLD ONES I BOUGHT SHAPED BETTER TO MY FOOT, THEY WERE MORE CUSHIONY"
2,Comfortable but run small and squeak!,"I love Reef flip flops. I bought this pair to replace a pair that I have nearly worn through. Just like my original pair these are incredibly comfortable. However they do run small. I normally wear an 8 1/2 or 9. The 9s are a bit small for me, wish I'd ordered up a size. The real problem with these is that they squeak when I walk! Not right away but after a little while they start to make a definite and loud squeaking noise. It's awkward and embarrassing and unfortunately I had to wear them all day so I won't be able to return them."
5,Very Comfortable,This is my first pair of Reef sandles and I have found them to be very comfortable. They run a little small as I usually wear a 7.5 but ordered the 8 for a perfect fit.
5,The BEST flip flops,"These are my favorite flip flops, ever! So comfy and cute -- very basic but practical. These are must have's if you wear flip flops often!"
3,Great shoe but not true to size,"This shoe looks great and is very comfy, but it runs small. Order one size up if you can. I wear a size 11M, the largest size available, so the shoe did not fit me well. Too bad they don't go up to a size 12, because I would have definitely exchanged them for the bigger size."
3,flip flop sandals don't match in height,"Really like the flip flops sandals - but the height of the soles don't match - one is at least an 1/8 to a 1/4"" higher than the other. I had already worn them before I realized what was wrong with them. So I guess I'm stuck with them (pitched the box & receipt). Have bought alot from Amazon in the past - never had a problem before. :(LindaDisappointed"
3,"Good quality, comfortable flip flops","These are good quality and comfortable flipflops. They have more support than other cheaper ones and the band is great. I am usually a 7 but had to give these to my mom and order the eights. I would still recommend them, just order up a size and don't wear them all the time. No flipflops are THAT good for you feet."
4,"Does run small, but feels great!","I ordered these in a size 8. I typically wear a 7 1/2 and usually have to order size 8 in a flip flops and/or sandals. I loved the way the straps fit but wasn't happy with the length of the flip itself. My heel was at the very end of the flip. So I ordered a 9 to compare. The 9 fits much better heel to toe but the straps are a little looser. I can't stand having my foot on the very edge. It makes them look too small. So for me, I went with the 9. The comfort of both the 8 and 9 was/is great! These are easy to wear straight out of the box. No rubbing, no blisters... overall a great, comfortable flip flop. I hope they last as long as other reviewers have stated."
2,Runs Small,"Ordered my size, but was too small to fit. Ended up giving it to my mother in law, who wears a size smaller than me.Seemed like comfortable sandals, but order a size bigger."
1,Wrong Size,"The website said size 6 Mens, the shoes were actually size 6 Womens, and the return process was designed so that I couldn't actually return them for shoes in the right size."
2,sizes run way small.,"I take a size 6.5 / 7 and the strap on this flip is just too tight. Using effort I can barely get the sandal on my foot, and you can see the pressure from the strap. At the same time I ordered this flip I ordered several Teva sandals with straps across the foot similarly placed and they fit just fine so I know my foot has not suddenly jumped up several sizes.Too lazy to return so will go to the GoodWill box. Will not buy this brand again."
5,All time favorite,"I love these flip flops, I always have a pair. Needed to replace my old ones, and it was a great price"
3,Flipflops,I loved the look of these flipflops and I always wear a size 8 but when I received these....they were a little small for my feet. They still kinda fit and I really liked how they look so I kept them regardless.
4,"Very comfortable flip-flop, runs normal to wide","My girlfriend has the men's version of these and I loved hers, so I went looking for a pair for myself for our upcoming Hawaii trip. These are great, and I love the thickness of the sole - minimal impact on your heel. I'm a fast walker, so I needed something that wouldn't rub between my toes. These don't. The only thing I will mention is that I have very narrow feet and these are definitely normal width-wide. The sole of the shoe is larger than the diameter of my foot by quite a bit. Not very elegant looking, but great for casual days."
3,A bit disappointed,"Love Reefs! However, the picture showed the pair that I was ordering to be blue and white. When I received them, they were actually blue and green. I did not feel like dealing with return process so I kept them."
4,"Super comfy, but runs small","These are some of the most comfortable flip flops I've ever purchased! Reef tends to make good, quality flip flops, and these don't disappoint! The heel is thick enough to be sturdy, and the arch has ""anatomical support"", unlike most flip flops that are just flat. My only complaint is that they run a little small and don't come in half sizes. I usually wear a size 7, but my heels were just at the edge of the back of the flip flop, which bothered me. I returned and ordered a size 8, which are a little big but they will work for me. Again, half sizes would be nice. These flip flops are definitely worth the price, and they will last a long time!"
5,These are great flip flops,"I had the same flip flops for three years. They finally lost their ""cushiness"" but I'm happy to say that the new pair is exactly the same as the old model. These are great for slipping on and walking around the house. The fabric toe piece is very comfortable, even if you aren't a big fan of most flip flops."
5,So comfy,"These are so comfortable, with a little arch support to. I ordered a size up after reading other reviews and they fit well."
5,OFFFF THa HOOoOOOK!!!!!,"This album is chock full of mind opening lyrical content, simply off the hook!!!!! Definitely cop it...you will be surprised at the refreshing viewpoint this kid puts out there..Hip HOp FOreVa YO!!!! peace and love"
5,Fantastic pedal for the money,"This pedal is so simple it's.......well.....simple. One knob. You turn till you have the treble boost you want & then it's either on or off. It's sounds great & one nice thing is you can boost a little more than you need, cut the treble at the end & voila! Nice treble boost & less noise. BTW you want to put this gadet as close to the guitar in your FX chain as possible. I have placed it right after my Pigtronix Philosopher's Tone which is a great Compressor/Sustainer, & the Pigtonix is first in my FX chain."
5,MAGNIFICO LIBRO,"Studied Spanish at the University of Minnesota back in the early 1970's and this text book was my introduction. It seemed to make learning Spanish easy and FUN! I have passed my original text book and work book on to my children and now have obtained additional text books and audio for my grandchildren through Amazon.com. It would have been nice to know that the audio included with the books is only for the first chapter and I will now have to search for the the rest, but this should be a minor problem, I hope. Over all I'm very happy with my experience. Thank You!"
5,Great product,This fits nicely into the hand held shower filter. During the winter especially it helps keep skin and hair from becoming too dry.
4,Full Concert of Classic Post Punk Material,"This is a full length concert of Danielle Dax who had just departed from the early post punk/noise group, the Lemon Kittens. On her own she takes a post punk/goth/psychedelic sound with aspects of world music similar to a more pop take on Siouxsie and the Banshees but utterly musically substantial and a highly under rated artist. The footage and sound are excellent but as with many television broadcasts from that time, the psychedelic light effects are a bit cheesey and frankly detract from the performance which otherwise is a rarity from a company offering archival post punk footage that would generally not have been otherwise available with excellent remastering."
2,CD was sold in cheap digipack that was received damaged,"CD was sold in cheap digipack that was received damaged and this way you can not replace it....Mailed it to Amazon, but until now no reaction at all..."
2,Poor remnants of a former genius,"With the albums Pop-Eyes and Jesus Egg that Wept, Danielle Dax demonstrated to be the biggest genius of her times. With Inky Bloaters and Dark Adapted Eye only demontrated her need to sell something, to find a wider audience, but still with inspiration and intelligence. This last title is just market-oriented disco music, where she gave up all her artistic fancies..."
3,Sad and sorrowful,I loved this book and read every word but I gave it a 3 because I was confused with some of the other person accounts. The Other Self. I am very well aware that the author was probably a multiple personality but i found the other confusing at times. this is the only book I have read by Frazer and am not sure I will seek out another. I felt sorry for Danny who deserved better. But then I don't think I was sexually abused as a child so how can I condemn one who was? [...]
5,My kids LOVE this calendar!,"They look forward to it every year with great enthusiasm. They are 7 and 10 but they've been coloring in the borders and making their own monthly pictures in these since they were 4 and 7. It keeps them really busy since they have to keep ahead of the monthly picture and they get to put themselves in the subject for each month (raking leaves for October, smelling flowers in May, etc.) They love drawing in it an using the stickers and they get alot of enjoyment out of seeing what they've done in the following months. Makes a great present too!"
2,read the book instead,"well, he werent much of a singer. or musician. certainly lack of these talents are usually aces in my book, but the music doesnt have much backbone to it and beneath it all, i'm a melody guy. try to get the much superior jook savages on the brazos instead if you must hear lester. its much more demented and unhinged. but mostly reread ""of pop pies and fun"" or the entire lou reed section from psycotic reactions to totally revel in the masters words."
5,Great balls,"Incredible balls, fast, fast, fast and fast.I have benn playing racquetball for 20 years now and these are the best of the best."
1,bad color,"I have played with these several times and the color blends in with the other colors in the court (like the yellow floor and the red lines). Maybe I am too much ""old school"" but the blue and green balls are a much better color contrast with the court."
3,"Great balls, but...","These are great racquetballs, but they are my first fireballs and I'm not sure if they were a bit flat or not. I expected a little more difference (there's only a slightly noticeable difference between these and old green/blue/purple ones I've played with). Again--they're my first fireballs, so I don't know whether they were perfectly new and ""inflated"" or a bit old and deflated [they seal was still on, they were new, but maybe they were on the shelf for a while, that's what I mean]."
1,Deceptive ad,"The photo would lead you to believe that you would get 5 balls, not true, you only get 2."
3,Good,"They are fast but not that fast, the ball it's more heavy that the blue one, you fell went you hired."
3,Degrading product,"I bought this in lieu of the 3 ball version as this was prime shipping and the other was not. As mentioned in my other reviews, these balls seem to have lost their durability. They are wonderful fresh out of the can and for around 5 uses, after that the speed drops dramatically and is noticeable. Unfortunately, I havent found much better yet...."
4,good but not great....,"This was my first Karen Ranney book.This book could have been a 5 star book if not for 2 flaws. One-the horrible title-My Wicked Fantasy-ugh. Besides the obvious insipidity and predictability of the title-it had nothing to do with the story- the characters were not each other's ""fantasy"" nor were they all that wicked.Second-the author is obviously talented but WAY too prosy, too over the top wordy. Meaning-everything that was description was flowery/metaphor filled, BUT the characters conversations were that way as well. They never just talked like normal people do. Everything was a ""war of words"". Which, can be fun, but like candy, too much is sickening.That being said-the book was still enjoyable enough to recommend-while I wouldn't pay full price for it, and enough of an inducement to try this author again.4 stars."
1,Ugh! Easily one of the most BORING books I've ever read. I had to force myself to read half of it. I gave up at that point.,"I have never fallen asleep so often while reading as I did with this book. I think the term ""long- winded"" would be too complimentary. No character can just walk across the room without the reader having to hear every thought in every mind of every character at that very moment. Karen Ranney would go on so long about what everyone was thinking, I'd forget what was physically happening in the scene. Even the love scenes were bogged down by what the couple was thinking in between each touch or kiss. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!"
3,"What you need from this book is an ""oasis"".","Compared to other books in the series, this one doesn't stand up. When finished, you're left wanting more. This time around, dinosaur involvement is almost none. In my opinion, the transition that one of the characters has from being jovial too, well, not when put in the crisis of being lost in the desert should not have happend; it would've made the time of them being lost more interesting. Very, very little action in this one folks. It's a good read if you have the time, but prepare to be disapointed."
4,"Good, interesting, nothing special","This book was like much of the series. It fleshed out areas and dinosaurs we haven't seen before, and was a easy read. I'm well above the age of the target readers though."
4,Great Essential-collection:o),This CD-collection are okay...i like most of the songs...Thanx Kenny for doing great music;o)**Cheerz from Bina in SWE*nov 26th-07*
5,Great CD!,I bought this for both my parents and my in-laws. I love it and so do all of them. Great gospel CD by the Gaithers. One of the better ones. I highly recommend it!
5,God Speaks Through This CD!,"I'll make this simple: this is one of the, if not THE, most incredible works of Christian music I have ever heard. If you love harmony that makes the hairs on your body stand up,and if you can imagine that feeling with annointed words that bring glory to our Lord and tears to your eyes, then this CD will not disappoint. God bless all of you in the GVB, because others are and will be blessed when they listen to this masterpiece."
5,Closer to God,"I like this CD better than any of the Gaither CD's. I don't much care for Christian music, but I love the majority of songs on this CD. The songs are sung in beautiful harmony. I know ""feelings"" aren't supposed to be a part of believing in God, but when I listen to this CD, it's the only time I actually ""feel"" close to God."
3,A VERY GOOD CD,"THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD. ALL THE SONGS ARE SUPERB AND THE ALBUM IS VERY INSPIRATIONAL. THE HARMONY IS GOOD, BUT I THOUGHT THE HARMONY ON THE CD AND VIDEO ""BACK HOME IN INDIANA"" WAS EXCELLENT... JONATHAN PIERCE ON ""BACK HOME IN INDIANA"" HAD SUCH A GREAT VOICE THAT HIS VOICE BLENDS SO WELL WITH THE OTHER VOICES... HOWEVER, I RECOMMEND THIS CD AND EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT..."
3,Not quite to par,"To anyone who has not heard the Gaither Vocal Band and likes southern gospel, YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD! however, if you are a long-time vocal band fan, it might disapoint. If you are looking for the stellar tenor vocals of David Phelps and amazing lead of Guy Penrod, they are few and far between on this recording. Only to be fouond on Sinner Saved By Grace and More Than Ever. There are some great classic songs but in comparison to their previous Album: God Is Good, and Their next album: Everything Good, This cd is just mediocre. If you want upbeat country songs, this is for you. But if you long for the classic Gaither powerhouse vocals in dramatic ballads, go for Everything Good or God Is Good!"
3,Talk about expensive!,"These chopsticks are not cheap, in fact they are about 100 times the cost of the cheap ones you buy. German Vs Chinese?! The chopsticks are rather plain and simple, not at all like the elaborate Japanese ones, which still cost less, so what are you getting? Well, I have to say the stainless steel rest is nice and the chopsticks do feel good in the hand. Would I recommend that you buy one? I don't think so, this product is overpriced and should cost at most around half of what it does now. One has to wonder what WMF was thinking, but I sure do like the box it came in... I must have paid for that and the little booklet. German Design at it's wackiest."
4,a classic,This movie is definetly a classic and a must have for those us that love the movies that Pedro Infante made.
5,Good lightweight liner sock,As you would expect from Smartwool these are nice wool sock liners. I especially like that they are white instead of the more common black version. No scratchiness at all and they fit me well.
3,Feel like normal liner socks,"I am a huge fan of SmartWool hiking socks as they are very soft and was hoping these would feel softer than normal liner socks. However, they feel scratchy like all other liner socks I've tried. That said, they were still warmer than most and they stay up.For those who need more info on sizing, SmartWool adult socks seem to be larger. I wear size 5 women's shoe/kids 3 and the adult smalls, which I'd be in the middle, are always too large. Kids large works perfect even though according to their size chart, I'd be at the low end."
4,Love these socks!,"Love these socks! I haven't tried them layered with another sock yet, but they fit great and keep my feet warm. Thinking about buying a few pairs!"
1,sock/liner,I did not like this sock. The seam made contact in just the wrong spot. My feet perspired way more than normal. The feel of the sock was scratchy. I would not recommend them.
3,no what i was wainting,"Some heavy metal magazzines have show the Blind Guardin band as one of the best in the world. I like the music and, since there is a BG festival, i was waiting for a great show. Good music, good video quality, but only it is a concert, like others of heavy metal bands no favoured by those magazzines..."
5,DVD that I have been waiting for so long.,"After I read the news that BG will released live DVD from their own festival. I have been waiting this DVD and can't wait anymore when it released. This DVD is worth the waiting. The package and graphic is very great. The concert in disc 1 is very perfect. The screen, the sound, the feeling and the atmosphere make me impressed and would like to be there in the concert. And I love the contents in disc 2 also. As it show how the festival come to real. Great, great, great."
1,Purely Academic Book,I regret buying this book. It is purely academic book and not for practitioners. I don't recommend buying it for businesses.
4,Reflections Upon The Mirror,"~This is really a top notch book. I am not sure if this is the only book you will ever need on Zen, there is often so much packed into two or three short sentences that the beginner might need some supplementary material to fully realise a sutra's inner hidden meaning. However having said that, this book is the most accessible work on Zen philosophy I have come across both on the internet and in book stores. There are some parts of this book I have read 10-15x and I still discover something new from time to time.I would certainly recommend this to any person starting to discover zen however to really get value out of this book, I would recommend using it in conjunction with further reading, only then will you discover that a page from this book is worth several from any other.For the Zen master, this book holds nothing but lies. ;-)"
4,Awesome!,Bought this for diy projects around the house.Pros: lightweight and portable and compactaccurate cuts and mitersCons: none
4,Good movie if you have not read book,"A good movie, but read book after viewing. After seeing movie you will feel good, after reading the excellent book you will have several emotions, sad, and glad for the two women in the story. Constance Bennett, the director, was the wife of my boss (an AF General), when I a new 2nd Lt in AF in 1962 and was a great lady and a lot of fun. She told me one time that the studio made her change story line to be acceptable to public at time."
4,A medieval beuaty,A very enjoyable CD with music that is eternal. A beautiful calming sound. It should requisite listing for all highway drivers. Slow down and listen to this music from the past.
4,Big Boy Pete-'Homage To Catatonia:The Pyschedelic Adventures Of Pete Miller' (Bacchus Archives),"Fourteen previously unreleased tracks, penned between 1966-69. Demos, actually. Sounds darn good for just demos. Some say that Big Boy Pete (aka Pete Miller) sounds a lot like the Trogg's vocalist, Reg Presley. Best described as offbeat psychedelic pop. Prior to this CD, the only tune I've ever heard from Big Boy Pete was the cut he's got on the various artists compilation 'Electric Sugar Cube', ""Cold Turkey"". Obviously, I must've been really impressed in order to seek out more of the man's repertoire. Most impressive tracks here are ""Sheer Lunacy"", ""1,500,000 Volts"",the semi-trippy ""Captain Of My Toy Balloon"", ""The Procession"" and the well written ""The Candleman"". Might appeal to some fans of The Turtles, The Herd, John's Children, The Creation and Michael Yonkers."
1,Worse product ever,This Face & Body Moisturizer gave my entire many face rashes. It's the worse product in the market. It's the absolute poison!
1,Failed to Charge - Not Good for a Charger,"Failed to charge my Flip Meno HD. The Meno's light was on indicating that it was getting power, but apparently it was getting just enough for the light to go on; it never got a charge. After plugging the Meno into a computer's USB, it charged right up. I haven't had time to return the little piece of crap, but I will."
2,breaks the SanDisk Sansa e260,"I bought this product to charge a SanDisk Sansa e260 MP3 player. After conneting the MP3 player to this product the menu item on the MP3 player no longer shows the USB Port option to allow you to select the type og device. I had two of the same model MP3 players, one for me and one for my granddaughter. It ruined both of them. The charger does seem to work okay with a Creative Zen MP3 player. Please be very careful about what you try to use this charger for. Make sure the device is still under warranty before trying to charge it with this charger. And that the vender will replace it or refund your money with no restocking fee if the charger kills the device. I bought my MP3 players from Newegg and they replaced one of them with no problem and were out of stock for the second one and refunded my money with no problem."
5,Charges iPod and Sansa,"I bought this to charge a cheap Sansa player, but it was also used to charge 2 different iPods. I really like how the plugs fold into the device, it makes it that much easier to pack."
2,Works with iPod...but be careful,"I purchased this adaptor to replace my missing Apple iPod charger. I needed a charger that I could use internationally, and this one specified an input voltage of 90-246V. The USB end of the dock connecter plugs into the charger (so you can charge other USB-connected device). It worked in the US and in India, but it did seem to electrify the metal on the iPod. It's not enough to really harm you, but I was concerned about the effects on the iPod's internals. I was able to adjust the dock connector until it barely connected to the iPod, at which point the metal was no longer electrified, but still charged the iPod. I know it wasn't a faulty dock connector, because it worked fine when connected to my computer."
5,Mr.,"A very handy device, used it to charge my Coby MP3 and it worked fine. Well disigned, very compact & easy to carry."
2,Caution Advised,"Although the description reads ""for MP3 players,"" be aware that this will not work with some players, e.g. my Creative Zen V Plus. Apparently there is no such thing as a universal USB charger, since some manufacturers require their own proprietary circuitry. Also it would not charge my Motorola Razr, even though the voltage output was correct."
5,"Cheap product, works fine","I successfully charged my mp3 player with this, and it worked fine. The adapter is pretty light, not to big, and the plug folds down which is quite convenient because it turns the adapter into a perfect rectangle, which is easier to carry. The adapter takes voltage from 90-264, volts, so it would work fine with an adapter to use in a country with different voltage outlets. Overall, it functions well and I have no problems with it."
1,"Heavy on philosophy, light on practicality","If you're new to market gardening and looking for solid info on how to run a CSA, this is *not* the book for you. For example, the chapter on harvesting and processing is only 2 1/2 pages long and boils down to ""it can't be explained in a book, you need hands on experience"". The majority of the book is self-congratulatory prose about how CSAs are saving the world. I support the CSA concept, but found this book a big disappointment. There are a few useful charts for determining share size and how much to grow, they are the only thing that prevents me from giving this book zero stars."
3,csa info,"Had lots of information if you are a group trying to start a CSA. We are farmers and need more of the nuts and bolts of organization. Not quite as helpful on this topic, but I did get a few bits of valuable information."
5,Highly Recommend,"This book accurately simplifies a sometimes overcomplicated section of the Bible - the book of Revelation. It is easy to read and understand, and also Biblically thorough. I used it with my study Bible and learned more than I ever have on Revelation, even tho I've taken classes on the subject."
5,Easy reading and an interesting topic.,Excellent review of China before the Japanese invasion and the advent of communism. Well written and found I couldn't put it down when I started reading.i
5,Extremely helpful,"I really appreciate the fact that this book is research based and advocates complementary medicine. I feel it really helped me sort through treatment options and show me how I could help my mother after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. She's currently doing cyberknife therapy, and now I know which supplements can help her with radiation therapy, and what I need to give her now (I chose curcumin or quecertin, vitamins, Ip6 and Maitake mushrooms, and am a Reiki practicioner so I do Reiki on her every night. Even Reiki is mentioned in the book!).If you're trying to figure out what to do, get this book first. It's also approved by the Cancer Treatment Centers of America, which practice allopathic along with naturopathic medicine in treating cancer."
3,Good info,I enjoyed the book but it was a lot to put into practice. I agree with him that cures are directly related to the foods we eat and the vitamins and herbs we take.
5,SO incredibly fun! Best Klutz book yet!,"My 7 year old loved loved loved this book. It came with tons and tons of great pages to make all kinds of fairies. Easy, yet creative! I also love that Klutz gives you tons of other ideas of how to make fairies without the products included. They are basically getting you started with the products provided in the book, then they show you tons of other great fairy making ideas. Possibilites are endless! Yay for Klutz!"
5,Adorable!,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter who can't get enough of crafts. I am one of those moms who really does not enjoy crafts but knowing how much joy it brings my daughter, I bought this as a special reward for her. To my surprise, I actually really enjoyed putting these fairies together and my daughter loved it, too -- it requires too much fine motor coordination for her but she is able to design the fairies and help me put them together. We made all the fairies so quickly that I'm thinking of purchasing another copy of this!"
4,Fairies: Petal People You Make Yourself,"This book is for my Granddaugther, she loved it.The condition was very good and I recieved it in a timly manor."
5,Not just for kids!!,"Okay, I'm 30, and I was looking in the childrens' section for books for my friend's kids, and I fell in love with these!! The fairies are so easy to make, and so adorable, that I couldn't resist. And I think it's great that this book was written by a 13-year old girl! Good for her! I just love fairies, unicorns, dragons, etc. and my adult friends have loved getting these as little surprises!"
1,TERRIBLE,Samantha McNesby is incompetent and cannot write sewing patterns. Her patterns have MANY mistakes and are very confusing. DO NOT buy this item!
2,A Wopat fan from way back,"I REALLY wanted to like this CD, because I like Tom Wopat and have gone to his concerts on several occasions. I even belonged to his fan club and have met him 3 times. But I don't. I didn't read the other reviews or I probably wouldn't have bought this CD. I just don't like the ""crooner"" type of music. His country efforts were MUCH better. While I'll probably be in the minority, all this CD did was put me to sleep. I'm hoping for a better one next time."
1,"Anyone can sing, but should they?","Tom Wopat has always been a very likeable guy and to tell you the truth, I wae really looking forward to this CD considering the choice of selections. Starting with the packaging I was very impressed with the presentation. I had seen him perform on the Tonys and thought he was having a ball, if not quiet on pitch with his fellow performers. I had heard he was performing in several Broadway productions and cabarets recently and assumed he had gotten much more comfortable with singing. Unfortunatly, unlike fine wine, he has not improved with age. I would probably go see him in a play but as far as musicals go, I don't see how he could be a selling point. His voice quality has none and the delivery seems tenative and frail. The arrangements seem to be meant for a strong singer that would enhance them. The man should stick to talk shows and acting because he has now proved that anyone can sing---but should they?"
5,Breathtaking,"Can't recall why I picked this up in the first place. Maybe it was the song selection? To me, it was a combination of clever, complex and passionate titles. I was familiar with who Tom was, but had never seen his TV show or had the pleasure of seeing him on Broadway.I have since picked up at least 3 copies of this CD and will probably pick up more. I'll find myself going on and on about how entertaining it was and then just give my copy away only to have to get another copy. And all along the way, making converts and fans. What a delightful surprise.If you appreciate an artist who truly knows his way with a lyric, you'll love this project."
3,Okay but not an introduction,"If you want an introduction, read another book like Hull. If you want to learn how to apply Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) approach to finance then it is a useful book. However, it is better to read an elementary PDEs book before reading this book. At least, learn how to solve parabolic PDEs analytically because the technical notes in the book would not help much."
1,Poorly written,"First this is not an introduction. The book for that is by Neftci. Second, it is not clearly written and Wilmott has invented a whole new symbol designation for the mathematical explanations. I just cannot recommend this book to anyone since it certainly is not an introduction and for those more advanced there numerous books such as Financial Calculus that fit that bill."
1,Read Hull Instead,"It seems the examples in this book are clones of those found in Hull. Odd, since the author seems to want to use more sophisticate math. Since the author can't explain calculus or properly define terms, there is doubt there is even that basic understanding. Pass on this and buy Hull instead for better clarity and better examples."
1,Copied Equations,"Wilmott seems to have copied theoretical derivations using partial differential equations and matrix multiplication symbols. The only examples in the book use basic algebra, so it seems as if the authors don't understand how to apply theory to practice except in the most simple cases.This book is irritatingly bad. Terms are not well defined. There are no concrete examples following the derivations as if the authors don't understand the meaning of the equations.The information on options seems to have been copied from the many derivatives dictionaries available on the web. It's clear the authors don't know how to apply the math to price these options. It seems their understanding is equivalent to that of a parrot."
2,not a good student introduction,"Assumes more than the stated early calculus and probability, therefore it would have been more beneficial to the student if greater rigor had been employed.The hints to exercises throw down the gauntlent so maybe my rating should be 2.5 stars."
4,On the border of classicism and romanticism!,"Erik Tawatstjerna is a prominent pianist who plays with steeled conviction every one of these Op.The jewel of the crown is of course, the ten pieces of the Op. 24, composed in a prolific stage where we find the first and second symphonies and Finlandia epic poem.Because, despite of the fact there is a marked influence of Liszt, Tchaikovsky and Grieg, we feel an expressive symphonic treatment in some of these works. Mention apart for the Nocturne, Romanza (the best piece of the set, so beloved by Siloti) and the Barcarole.The Bagatelles are elegant musical miniatures that own charm but lack of depth."
3,Strong on feeling; lacking on facts...,"I enjoyed this book a great deal, however there were some problems. View some of the films listed in this book, then read the reviews. It is apparent the writer(s) did most of this from memory, and a few holes are glaring. (Check out the sections on Dolemite and Fight for Your Life for examples).However, not all is lost. This book gives its reader a great sense of what these horrible, dangerous, wonderful theaters were like. The atmosphere, the denizens, the smells and sounds and the drugs and the sex.I reccommend this book for that reason alone. For good info on these types of movies, check out Michael J. Weldon's Psychotronic books."
4,"good product, delivered late","we liked the poster but it was delivered several days after christmas, even though it was supposed to arrive before. So, I can't endorse the seller."
3,Nice music but in Mono!,"It's the 21's century. A recording, even a live recording should be in stereo. End of story. I like the spirit of this disc, the coming together of musicians from different cultures to play folk songs of peace and love to promote understanding and fellowship. All good, but a recording in mono is a boring thing to listen to. It sounds flat and undefined. Unacceptable. I will listen to other Yair Dalal recordings before this one gets back on my player.I will say the performance is nice. Too bad. It's just not a lot of fun to hear a mono recording. It's not the 60's anymore."
5,action packed thrill ride through development economics,"The contribution of Mr. Morrison et al to the world is second only to the guy who invented the wheel and the woman who invented reading and writing. If these latter two had met and progenerated, the absquatulation of the pairing could have no better outcome than Morrison, who, during breaks from rocking the casbah with Bono in the twosome ""floralia"", unleashes a powerful interpretation of current statistical data with stinging analysis and brilliant conclusions that would make Disraeli conclude that there are only two kinds of lies after all. If development econ is your bag, hang onto your hats and prepare to greet the revolution. This is the finest work on the subject since Amartya Sen started feeling entitled."
1,Grocery,"The last case of Creme Savers Hard Candy, Chocolate & Caramel sounded good but turned out not to be so great, taste was good but I kept finding peices of the candy packaging inside the candy itself. Not sure what happened during the making of the batch I got but have never found this problem with the other flavors. I suggest you do not order the Chocolate & Caramel, chose another flavor!"
1,Confirm Availability before ordering,"I ordered this book in October, with a 3 week delivery, and have still not received it. Now I have been asked, by Amazon, to review it. I hope it's a really good book."
1,rip off,"I ordered this used equipment for my son to practice on, however the speakers did not work, the mic was missing. I contacted the seller and explained the situation, he was very uncooperative and refused the return or refund my money. I paid 150.00 used, the new one was 200. To replace the speakers and the mic was 75.00. I would have been better off buying new one."
5,On fire,This is tha hottes S##t out there. Betta than Gay-z's Unfinished business and colission course album. Get this. It's fire baby!
5,Hip-Hop's Saviour,"What's there to say about Nas that hasn't already been said? Street's Disciple, Nas' latest album, he goes back his roots, bringing that 90s feel is coming back. I listened to this album straight through and didn't need to skip a single song, easily the best album of the year!!!Featured artists include: Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, Olu Dara, Dough E. Fresh, Kelis, Scarlett, Emily, Quan, Maxwell and Keon Bryce.Production from Salaam Remi, L.E.S, Chucky Thompson, Mike Brinkly, Q-Tip and Nasir Jones himself.Definately one for the collection..."
3,too much material,"i thought this album was ok, but it would have been better as one disc, cutting out 5 or 6 of the weaker tracks. i dont care if you didnt find this review helpful coz the real reason i wrote this review is to say that the featured artist scarlett, is in fact nas himself with his voice pitched up.i would recomend this if youre a nas fan, i always buy his albums, no matter the quality coz they always have 2 or 3 classic songs, this is no different, infact id say it has more quality tracks than all his joints since it was written, particularly the first disc."
1,garbage @ss album. not worth the $1.20 i paid at allofmp3,"the beats just suck. he needs much more innovation in the production of his music. he needs to catch up with the modern rap production of guys like Kanye West if he wants to make an impact. this has zero replay value, and i dont like any of the songs"
1,"1,5","The only good song in this album is Bridging The Gap.This is not Illmatic.Nas I liked much more of Illmatic.Illmatic is a classic and deserves 5 stars.I like Nas but this cd I dont.One more thin, Nas why do you had to make to cd's you can put the songs in just 1 cd.That is just tryin to make easy money and I don't like that.You are acting like Eminem man.Peace for everybody"
1,Why does Nas rap? Why don't he just write?,"Come on now, everyone be real. We all know Nas can't rap, he can only write. This cd lyrically can only be considered as average, compared to Jay-Z's ""The Blueprint"" and even that garbage rapper Eminem's ""Encore"". Nas hasn't made a great cd since ""Illmatic"", and hasn't made a decent cd since then. The main point is that even with the release of ""Illmatic"" Nas can't rap. Nas has lived a life full of contradiction, and more contradiction, and that is exactlly what ""Street's Disciple"" is, just 2 dics of contradiction. There was one track i did seem to like to a point and that was ""Bridging the Gap"" which he did with his dad. Suprisingly I believe his dad has more talent then him. If you want to hear some real rap by some artists who can actually flow and have great lyrics, then go buy Royce Da 5'9's ""M.I.C. (Make It Count)"" and ""Death is Certain, Fabolous' ""Real Talk"", Mos Def's ""New Danger"", or Talib Kweli's ""Quality"" and ""Beautiful Struggle""."
1,Worst Nas album ever,"I frankly am shocked that Nas would put out an album this awful. The only good song on here is ""Thief's Theme"", everything else is trash from start to finish. First of all the production is the most hideous and repulsive I've ever heard. The beats on here sound like they were produced by a 2 year old. Who ever produced this album should be shot in the face pointblank with a shotgun. The lyrics are bellow Nas's standards and his perfomance on here is shockingly bad. I've always had respect for Nas but this album is just so awful and lame I couldn't hold that in. Hopefully Nas's next album will be much better. I hear he's gonna sign with the ROC, which would be a good move. Get any of Nas's previous stuff but avoid this like the plague."
1,What the ....,"This reviews are all from the same dude.He keep changing names and do different reviews giving 5 stars to the cd.Dude you must be an hell of a f.*.g.g.o.t.This cd is very bad.Stop doing that dude you already do your own review.Buy encore from eminem, it deserves 4 stars"
2,Greatest double album of all time? Don't Make me Laugh,"WOW!... As I sit here laughing to the brink of tears I can't help but think... my my my, how we quickly forget. NO album, and I mean NO ALBUM will ever touch ALL EYEZ ON ME by the Greatest MC the Earth has and EVER will see. PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Makaveli the 7-day Theory alone will SMASH any LP. Tupac was before his time, he was truly a prophet and to mention ""Nas"" in the same breath as 'Pac is not only doing an injustice to hip hop but to yourself. Get a grip."
4,Nasir------The Underated,Street disciple was a very good cd but also had some songs that was very dissappointing this is also the best outta every nas cd out.............he stood with his style and talked about things that matters in like although for most of the tracks he coulda had better beats ----------his lyrics are fabulous but it's the beats that turns u from listening to it ------(Nas Needs a New Beat Maker For Sure)
3,"Weak production, dope lyrics","I'm going to review this album fast: great lyrics, as always, but weak production, real weak production. I think Nas has the name, the fame, and the credibility to be surrounded by the best producers, but you ain't gonna find such a thing here: dope lyrics on weak tracks, what a waste! Where are the likes of Primo, The Alchemist, Kanye West, Hi-Tek, Pete Rock, etc., to take care of the production? If you're a hard-die fan buy it, if not..."
4,myke,"this is a creative album that is not perfect but not far from it,the beats are crazy different and are not of this galaxy but they are nice,he has all kinds of messages and cleverness throughout the album,i like it more than most of these wack albums out including the black album that was ok,nas is a truegift to hiphop who is misunderstood,if you could open yourmind to truthfulness you will have no choice but to like thisalbum.........the king is here and never left."
5,THE KING IS BACK,"Nas drops another classic. Finally an artist brings hip hop back. This double disc is definately a classic...the closest thing to Illmatic and the best cd in years. I, personaly like disc one better even tho both are amazing. Some of my favorite tracks are Sekous Story, Live Now, Just a Moment,, Virgo and War. Not even one song on this cd is a filler. Nas is definately the king of hip hop. The people that said this album is wack truly have no hip hop knowledge and their comperhension doesn't go beyond nelly and chingy, and those type of people definately shouldn't get this cd. But for the true hip hop fans this cd is a must."
4,Nothing like some of his other albums,"I liked this CD it was not the best. I thought Nas did not offer as much to say that he did on some other albums. 2 albums may have been two much even for such a great MC like Nas. I am a big Nas fan and have been for about 5 or 6 years. The Production values were not that much. Some was underground but some of it was just not the best that I have heard. I believe message to the feds-""Disciple""-""Biagraphy of Rakim""-""Getting married"" wich was a lyrically deep song to Kelis. ""Bridging the Gap"" as you know features Nas dad Curtis Jones aka Olu Dara. ""Thiefs Theme"" was also a banger and was a good single.I liked this CD a little and will give it a thumbs up.Lyrics 8 Production 7 X Factor 7 Classic 9 Replay 8Total=8 out of 10 FingersI have not heard the whole album so I may change my mind with time. I just am going from what I heard so far."
3,Pretty Good but to long,"Nas is a Talented Cat,but He just can't carry a two discs&truth be told it's hard for Him to carry afull Set these days. He knows how to Craft a catchy Song,He knows how to challenge you mentally.very gifted flower&Has a strong presentation,but sometimes he gets a bit to heavy handed for His own good&also loses His edge along in places.He think He wastes His Talent by going after easy targets on His Record as well.He needs to challenge Himself again.but His Flow is still top of the line,though He just can't pull it all together as one.still you will always give Nas the Beenie of a Doubt in a Heartbeat.this set is too long which works against Him."
4,A Little To Much,"I thought the Streets Disciple, was a good album, but the whole two disc thing isnt working for me. First of all its a pain changing the cd's when theres only 11-12 songs on them plus a bonus track, and also the few bad songs on there are BAD, so its a pain switching. I felt that he made to many slow songs about his love life, but most of the songs were great, its just not onw of his best performances, but still great."
3,"good, but not that good 3.5 stars","i have a very high respect for nas and everything he has done, but there is no justification for making this a double disc. don't get me wrong, nas has some outstanding tracks on here, but there is so many fillers and weak songs that at some times it becomes unlistenable.if he would have put the best 13 songs onto one disc and left all the others out, this would be a 5 star performance.Best Songs (In Order):5.Me & You (Dedicated to Destiny)4.War3.Rest Of My Life2.Tie: Just A Moment/Virgo1.Live Nowcop this just to listen to these songs there are others that are hot too"
1,yeah,Yeah you are 40+ and Im Santa Claus.This is always the same guy with different nicks.You must be very stupid.This cd is bad.Stop doing that dude.You already did youre review
1,wierd,JAY-Z BEATS NAS AT EVERY ANGLE AND POINT. NAS'S FLOW SUX. IF U CAN NAME A SINGLE SONG THATS BETTER THAN JAY-ZS Can't knock the Hustle or brooklyns finest or dead presidents ill give u a cookie :)..o wait u can't. JAY-Z BEATS NAS
1,GARBAGE,"I wish I could give this album zero stars. People have been giving unnecessary props for too damn long. I really have been trying to give him the benefit of the doubt, but the truth is, he doesnt have anything to say.I know that a lot of people might think that he is intelligent but I think he one of the most UNDER-EDUCATED people in the rap game, he just tries to sound like he knows what he is saying and it really show how smart his fanbase is because they but into it.This album is 25 songs of crap, a damn waste of my time.I don't know where u people are from; but the buzz around brooklyn is that this CD is trash.There are only about 5-6 songs on a 25 song cd that actuallty decent. That song with his pops, its cute and all but its wack and that american way song; can kelis just stop making music she is TERRIBLE. I dont even have a favorite song.How the hell is this a classic.I was very disappointed I give up on this dude"
1,i love nas...,...no im just kidding.nas youre finished this cd is bad as hell.even kelis does better cd's than you do.
1,just bad,Nas cant rap.I think he would be better if he just write songs for other rappers.Nas this cd is bad.Illmatic was a true classic but this is nothing
1,nas is washed up,"nas should of retired after his not so good album ""god's son"". i think his time has past and he should of given it up when he had the chance. if you want some good rap go buy nas, eminem, 2pac, biggie, jay-z. don't waste your money on this album, it ain't even worth it."
3,it's cool,We can say it's good but not that good as illmatic.Illmatic was the bomb but nas needs to think about it because this cd isnt so hot.But its good
3,I miss illmatic....,"[...] I got illmatic first before I'd even heard Nas and I fell in love with it. But I must say this album was sort of a disappointment. Joints like American Way just make me want to puke. There are a few hot joints here though which is why I give it 3.5 outta 5. The best songs (not in order) are:Suicide Bounce- By far the best song on the album Love ItJust A Moment- Real good track tho it does get old after a whileDisciple- I love the drums on this one. AddictiveStreets Disciple- Surprisingly Olu Dara makes this track hotVirgo- The beat-boxing here is unbelievable Doug E. FreshLive Now- Kinda boring but worth a listenMessage to the Feds: Great but too shortMakings of a perfect B*tch is Filler out the A$s wasting of a really good beat. Me & You is alright. I dont really like much more of the album.3.5 outta five, if your a really big Nas fan you'll probably enjoy this but otherwise pick up Black Rob or 2pac."
2,Streets not listenin',"Nas let me down. Nas goes unparalleled to anybody holding the mic right now and that goes for even Young H-O himself. I thought surely Nasty Nas would hold it down, especially with his arch-nemisis hanging up his mic! Wrong, this album was disappointing to me! Instead of making a two disc C.D. set, Mr. Jones should have just taken maybe 8 from each disc to make one 16 track album(could have cut out the album filler that way, this album has alot of filler)! Nas has what it takes to be the undisputed king of NY(with Young H-O retired ofcourse), but this album is definitely not his best, and if possible burn this C.D. from a friend, please dont waste your guap..."
4,Pretty Good Stuff,"NaS is one of those rappers whose albums I don't hesitate to buy-- it's really hard to go wrong with his music. This album is not one of his best, but it is still a top-shelf album. My biggest beef is the number of ""filler"" songs, as if he decided he needed a double album, but couldn't come up with two CD's worth of fresh ideas. Favorite tracks: A Message to the Feds, These Are Our Heroes, Sekou Story/Live Now, Just A Moment, Street's Disciple, Bridging the Gap, Getting Married, War...wait, this is half the tracks...well, you get my point."
4,Another strong album by Nas,"Nas' eighth album, Street's Disciple, is his only double disk release in his discography so far. It was pretty eagerly anticipated.Disk 1 was great. I really liked it. There were some great tracks like A Message to the Feds, Sincerely We The People, These Are Our Heroes, Sekou Story, Just A Moment, and others. I was really digging Nas' lyrics.Disk 2 was alright. There were some good songs, my personal favorite being War, but it wasn't as good as disk 1.I kindof wish it was just a single disk. Oh well. Still a solid outing by Nas.My favorite tracks: 1. War 2. A Message to the Feds, Sincerely We The People 3. Just A Moment 4. Sekou Story 5. These Are Our Heroes."
4,4.5 stars- hotttttt,"best songs""A Message To the Feds, Sinclerely We the People""""Just A Moment"" (Feat. Quan)""Bridging The Gap"" (Feat. Olu Dara)""U.B.R.""""Me & You""""Thiefs Thiem""""Virgo"" (Feat. Ludacris & Doug E. Fresh)u should get itand this is coming from a G-Unit fan"
1,OVERRATED BY ALL YOU RIDERS!!!,"I can't believe I wasted my money on this!!! What the hell was Nas thinking!? This album is flat out garbage! The beats are wack and Nas comes real weak on it! I'm pissed, I want my money back! Other than Thief's theme....THAT'S IT! Anyone else who praises this album is either a rider or has poor tastes in music! I'm happy with my Illmatic, Stillmatic...and even It was Written albums....but this!? This is just a freakin let down.Damn...don't pay more than 3 dollars for this album....you will be severley disappointed....go see for yourself if you don't believe me! This was really weak, whick, whick, wack sh^t!"
2,Blah,"You could maybe trim these 2 Cds into a decent EP, but even that would be a stretch. I had low expectations for this album due to everything he has released since Illmatic, and low and behold the album was exactly what I expected--DULL."
2,What the hell is this???????????,"Illmatic-Luved it....classicIt was written-Luv itI am-Luv it....classicNastrudomas or however its spelled(lol)-luved itStillmatic-Luved the hell out of it....CLASSIC and the best album he's ever doneGod's Son-Luv itLost Tapes-Luv itStreets Disciple-????????????What the hell is this?I don't know what Nas was thinking when he droped this but this album could have been better and should have been one disc. To many fillers and not enough hits. i was really pissed off by this album. Don't get me wrong it has its moments but it could have been a hell of a lot better. I'm sorry but its just the truth. The only songs on here are These are our heros,Live now,Just a moment,remember the times,bridging the gap,Me & you,and thief's theme. The rest is GARBAGE. Serious with AZ didn' even make the album cut and thats BS. I hope Nas's new album is better because this was just a damn travisty. 2 Stars....and this is from a Nas fan. Wow!"
5,Wow...i'm speechless,"Nas is the indisputable greatest lyrist of all-time (second greatest rapper behind Biggie) and he proves this with this album. Not only did he bring that usual brilliant genuine lyrics, he brings hot productions and beats that jus make u wanna zone out. I, personally, don't have a bias for Nas (so dont put that in your head) because I didnt really like ""I am"" and I practically hated ""Nastradamus."" But ""Street's Disciple"" challenges Nas's best album, which was his debut, Illmatic. THERE ARE NO BAD SONGS. 100 % QUALITY AND 100 % FROM THE STREETS. You won't be disappointed..."
5,Nas is Still Here to stay,"Imma make this short, Nas is still and will forever be on point. Every single song has a story to it and you'll always walk away with something enlighting in every track. Keep bringing the heat Nas. - Yeag I wrote 2 reviews by mistake!!! but it dont matter, Nas is one of the Best MC's"
3,WEAK PRODUCTION alot of filler,"STREET DISCIPLE suffers from lack of production, and wierd lyrics. Maybe its me but while listening to some tracks i found myself asking ""what the **&& is he talking about. The album starts off good but slowley falls into average territory.I belive the album would have been alot better if he cut like 6 songs out and left it as a single cd. Nas has proven he still has skills with ""Stillmatic"" and ""God Son"" but ""Street Disiple"" just has to much filler. This album seems very personal so personal that Nas looses the listener, because we dont know what hes talking about. Producers Salim Remmi and L.E.S try to bring back the days of old and they do a average job. I think nas should bring back DJ PREMIER!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,i GAVE it to my friend,"I really had high expectations about this album. But it was a disappointment. I think Nas is cool but he's not a Biggie or Pac. Especially after hearing this ""music"". The first disc was average and that's it. The song with Kelis was horrible. And the George Clinton sample has been done so many times. ""These are our Heroes"" was cool. And some other tracks. The second disc was garbage. If you a dedicated Nas fan, then feel free to pick this up. I think he's trying to be too deep or trying to be complex which hurts this album."
4,"Good Album, but not his best.",Nas made a good come back with Streets Disciple. But its not his best album.
3,nas is losing.....,nas (at the height of his career) was my favourite rapper.... i loved nas that boy told the truth.... now he is getting corny.... i love kelis (the breathing diamond) but i think she got that brotha really soft the past few years...nas is my boy but if you dont get it together soon you will loose your fans....especially this one....
3,Average,"This is not Nas' strongest album, should not have made it a double album, thats what kills it, theres a lot of strong material on there, lyrics are mostly on point, production is weak. Should have stuck with a single-disc album, and that's just the truth, this isn't a 5, or even a 4, 3 1/2 at best, all the reviews on here are bias in favor of Nas, and aren't honest at all."
4,Classic Double Album,"I got this album yesterday. I heard the singles, Thief's Theme and Bridgin' the Gap (f/ Olu Dara) on MTV, and the Ludacris collabo, Virgo when I copped the Red Light District album. I loved each disc, but the second one was the hottest. Top five songs overall:1. U.B.R. (Unauthorized Biography of Rakim)2. Thief's Theme3. Suicide Bounce (f/ Busta Rhymes)4. Bridging the Gap (f/ Olu Dara)5. Virgo (f/ Ludacris) and Just a Moment (f/ Quan) (tied)"
5,To G. Kubrak :....this album is 5 stars,"First of all, what would someone from Israel know about true hip-hop? Try going to the mecca of hip-hop, New York, and understand the culture before you spew your vile insults. This album is a classic, and anyone who thinks otherwise must be a Jay Z fan. Nas ripped Jay Z and exposed Jigga for being the fake ""bling bling"" rapper that he is."
4,A little overhyped,"This CD is hot, but not quite what was expected. Still it a great cd. The beats are perfect for Nas, he just dominates them and makes his voice stand out. Get this CD you will not be dissapointed"
4,Nas back again,"This CD is pretty good but probably would have been better as a single CD, for the fact that its a task to skip through the filler and get to the hot tracks.I have one problem with one song ""American Way"" Nas' lyrics are good but the beat and the chorus are horrible.The chorus is ""yeah i think about this everyday thats the american way"" spoken by Kelis- annoying and kills the track.Other than that its alright really not a great album too many tracks get lost because of it being a double CD"
4,Midknite,"This album is almost vintage Nas (Illmatic)this is a mature and mind concious Nas at his best. This album features some of the best metaphors and thought provoking lyrics that I've heard from him in a while. This album shows Nas trying to switch up with different styles and material, this I beleive actually works for him. Its always good to try different things, besides no one should try to do what worked in the past. This is definite must for anyone who considers themselves a true Nas fan"
5,One of the bests,"OK first of all this cd is really good only downfall is that he didnt take up enough room on the cds and that some of the best could have been better but all in all it is a classic. My favourite songs are message to the feds,nazareth savage,Disciple,live now,just a moment,all the songs on the second cd except for getting marrierd,no one else in the room, and war. You should indifinetly pick up this cd or ur missing out hard."
4,"Great Queen collection, but not Karaoke CDs","I'm also a big Queen fan, and purchased the CDs rather than the DVD. I had intended to use this for karaoke, but was disappointed to find that the CDs are not CD+G, meaning they do not have karaoke display. This is a great product, and will be a collector's item, as long as you know what you are buying.If you can get a hold of the DVD, it does have onscreen lyrics. While probably not playable at your local karaoke club, if you have the equipment, you can use it to make your own karaoke CD."
2,ehhh,hard to use.. exchanged it for a different phone with a real name brand.. i dont know if its because the one i bought was used but it didn't work to well for me.
2,Came on time but does not work properly,"I gave this 2 stars mainly because the delivery was on time. It was evident that the phone was used as the box had been opened and re-taped..(I understood that before I purchased it)...yet when I set it all up according to the manual., the line was loaded with heavy static and an echoed return voice when I spoke to my party. Sorry, but it is all packed up to be returned."
4,It came with NO manual..,This item arrived without a manual so it's still sitting in the box! As soon as I get a moment I will look for a manual online.
2,"Cute shoe, tight fit","The shoe is really cute on, but I think their sizes run quite small. I recommend ordering a size larger than your actually shoe size."
4,Cute and soft,"The shoes are very comfortable and cute; only drawback is theheel, which is plastic. Therefore the design partially wore awayand I will have to repaint using a marker."
4,Good dictionary - really helps build vocabulary,"I am an English teacher and having eight Russian students with no English vocabulary apart from yes/no, and Russian not one of the languages I know, I used this dictionary to communicate with my Russian students. It worked. The pictures are clear, the reference to the word in Russian and English is easily traceable from the picture and it did work to build vocabulary. As you start getting to grips with Russian (or English) you will definetly need a 'heavier' dictionary. Thus after three months I do not need this book any longer as all the students can speak English but I couldn't have done it without this book. A must buy."
5,Fabulous Quick Reference,"I took Russian for nine years in the Chicago Public Schools, and this was one of my greatest references. Granted, it is not meant to be the ONLY tool a student of Russian will use. I compare this book to Richard Scarry's Greatest Word Book Ever, except with Russian words for everything pictured. And don't be fooled by the ""Picture Dictionary"" title. This is not merely for children. I am 24 years old, and trying to re-learn some Russian, and am still using this great book. This would be a great reference for any student of Russian."
5,Fantastic!,"As a native English-speaking, beginning student of Russian language, I am finding this a very useful book. The format is great for me because I learn well visually. Each page is a busy picture (e.g. ""In the Living Room"", ""Outdoor Activities"") with relevant items in the picture numbered. Under the picture is a legend to provide the name of each object from the picture in English and Russian (in Cyrillic). It is a fantastic resource because there are so many objects and situations: just about every action and activity in the house, most of the animals in the zoo, etc...For native Russian speakers, the book provides English pronunciations. Unfortunately, the same is not given for the Russian words (though once I master Cyrillic, I imagine this will be unneccesary.) Overall, this is a great reference for English and Russian speakers to build their vocabulary and easily answer their own questions as they come up."
4,good for intermediate and up,"This book is fun to read. It explains the subtle differences in meaning and usage for many close words, with ample examples to accompany the explanations. It finally cleared to me the difference between gexing and xingge which are both translated as character, or personality, after not even native chinese speakers could explain this in I way I could understand.. The fault of this book is that it could be bigger, a lot bigger. It basically only covers a few hundred common words and synonyms. Still, definitely only for a student who knows how to say a sentence or two in chinese, and although all the characters are accompanied by pinyin, a knowledge of 1000-1500 characters would come in handy. It's NOT a tutorial nor a course!"
4,The Last Roxy Music Album...,"This is Roxys last gasp...I mean ""wheres Eddie Jobson??"" Actually this really a good recording, its just that the first 5 Roxy Music albums were so flawlessly perfect that its hard to stand up against that level of perfection...anyway..with that said...I have NO IDEA why they took off the great rock version and put the disco-fluff version of Angel Eyes, which is hard to find on CD. This, to me is really the last Roxy Music Album, because you just CANT have Roxy Music without Paul Thompson...sorry. I mean Avalon and the others are nice pieces, but they really should have been Bryan Ferry solo albums because Andy and Phil are really playing more as session players there."
3,Halfway better than you thought,"This album completes Bryan Ferry's rejection of the experimental attack that Brian Eno brought to Roxy Music, and I hated the album when I first listened. But over time, it has grown on me, at least the first (east) side -- if you disregard ""Trash.""As if admitting defeat, Roxy Music remixed, remade and remodeled the first three tracks on side one, with results that probably infuriated new-wave loyalists and intrigued the late-coming disco generation. The second side is mostly forgettable, although Perry Como fans may find ""Dance Away"" vaguely appealing.Some people have classified ""Manifesto"" as their favorite Roxy release. More power to you, even if you're wrong. But if this album spurs anybody to explore the earlier Roxy albums, then it has served its purpose."
3,Almost the album I wanted,"Don't get me wrong - I *love* this album. Not as much as some other Roxy Music albums, but enough that I was hankering to replace my cassette tape with CD. My eurodisco favorite, ""Angel Eyes"" was REPLACED however with some glam-like mediochre creature without the fun and innocence of the version I love so much - All I'm saying is be careful because not all is the same with the CD."
2,The weakest of the canon,"Unlike the rest of Roxy Music's catalogue I was disappointed with this album. A weak comeback attempt after 4 years out, this album is little more than a pale shadow of Roxy Music's early work. 'Dance Away', 'Still Falls the Rain' and 'Ain't That So' are good Roxy tracks but the rest falls short. The title track is almost abhorrent. If they were looking for new musical styles, then they found it on the next one 'Flesh and Blood' and 'Avalon'. Forget this one."
1,Ill fated comeback attempt,"Roxy Music broke up after Siren, leaving fans wanting more, but with a near perfect catalog. Manifesto was their first album after reforming, and ushered in the muzak period that followed. The songs are weak and it doesn't rock. By all means skip this one and check out the first 5 brilliant albums."
2,Ferry tails,"A dead album of a band with no spirit. You can recognize the classic Roxy Music by few songs like Manifesto, but the main line is softer than ever, till then. Actually, ""Manifesto"" is more Bryan Ferry solo, although Manzanera and Mackay did some writing work too. Ferry took the rocky ""Angel eyes"" and make it a disco version, that luckily, is not in ""Manifesto"". ""Stronger through the years"" can make you sleep, ""Trash"" is not far from being trash, ""Dance away"" takes you directly to the next dead album, ""Flesh and blood"", and the rest is boring - the last word to describe Roxy albums till then."
5,The Best Music For A Mellow Morning,"For those who love Elliott Smith, or just chilling in the early hours of the morning, this album is a must listen. It is completely and utterly perfect for when you're sitting around, on the edge of sleep, but unwilling to give in yet. Fantastic lyrics and melodies that you can let wash over you. Some stand-out tracks are 'Contradictions,' 'Let it Be,' and 'Time Away.'"
4,Underrated Canadian Punk Band,"My cousin introduced me to the Forgotten Rebels when I was a young teenager growing up in the greater Toronto area. I worked with Mickey DeSadist for awhile at the same company. Considering that the Rebels still play live shows, this band has endured a long career through the over-reinventing of the music business.Good raw punk energy, guaranteed to offend at least one person you know. Tight music, great to listen to with the windows wound down on a summer afternoon. Turn it up and appreciate it!"
3,bits,"I would like to give a review of this product, but have yet to receive them. Ordered in March and back-ordered and re-back-ordered ever since. Maybe someday they will come."
4,meets expectation,"I take one off for price/value but I have no issue with the product itself.Compared to the friable plastic junk on most stems, these are a true upgrade. They should last the life of the stem and beyond. If they get stuck, use a hex wrench to loosed them. Well finnished and shiney."
5,Great for the price,These are perfect and affordable. Great replacements for when your caps disappear or are replaced with cheap black plastic caps.
3,Not bad - You get what you pay for.,"They're not exactly sturdy - made very thin and light. On the other hand, they're pretty inexpensive, so I guess you can't expect them to be the best quality. All in all they do what they're supposed to do and they look good."
5,Makes your vehicle look better,"I own a 2007 Ford F150 Harley Davidson Ed Truck, need something for the valve stems, these did the trick. Now everything looks good. A happy customer."
3,Not quite an o-ring as stated in the description,"I have been looking for replacement caps for the excellent ones that came with my McGard installation kit and thought these were the ticket (the good folks at my tire installer just threw my excellent McGard caps on the floor as trash even after I specifically have told them to keep them). The caps themselves are great quality, but the ""completed o-ring seal"" wasn't what I expected (and really what I'm on the search for). The 'o-ring seal' was not actually toroidal o-rings, but rather flat circular gaskets just like in pretty much all other caps I've found anywhere. I'm using these for the time being with success, but am still on the lookout for true o-ring sealed caps."
4,Perfect for first time parents,I read this book in the 80's when I was expecting my first baby. It made an impression so I love giving it to other new parents. It is delightful.
5,Excellent help and guide for parents dealing with divorce,"Excellent. I have read this book many times, ordered more and given them away because of the many variances of help. When you facing divorce it's hard enough and children should never be put in the middle. This book is a great help that no matter what age the child is during separation and divorce those wounds will need to heal through every new portion of mental growth for the rest of their life. How to love and continue healing can be found - this book gives good direction."
4,HQ on Progressive Video and Audio but no CD-R/MP3 capable!,"I bought this about an year ago. Just as it came out. When wired to my Sony WEGA 40"" Progressive gives an Super Impressive Image.. The video quality is exceptional but i have not basis of comprason since i have not seen any ither progressive DVD wired to Progressive TV (WEGA) anywhere else.Nevertheless it hurts that such a good ($$)unit will not play at least CD-Audio CD-Rs if not MP3s. I have yet to try it with DVD-Audio disks, but I expect to be awed by the sound. My dvd is wired to Yamaha(THE Best:they make ALL internal compunents) V596 Amp + 5 NHT (when knocked on, they sound like Solid wood)speakers.REMEMBER! Always to use GOOD quality wires(MONSTERCable), even if it seems to have a high acquisition price. Otherwise you are cheating yourself big time!"
4,Correction in Previous Review,"I'm sorry if I caused any confusion with my previous review. This book does cover the past ballparks like Ebbett's Field, etc. However, they are grouped together in the rear. In the previous edition all stadiums were listed alphabetically by city."
3,"Good, but not great","Visually, this is a very nice piece of work, and ought to keep most baseball fans happy. It would have been nice, however, to see more complete writing on several parks (the piece on Dodger Stadium is especially short) and more photos. With new parks opening quickly, I hope a second, larger edition isn't too far off."
5,Great visuals!,The visuals in this book are extremely rich and really reflect the nostalgia of America's favorite past time! A must for every baseball purist..
3,Ballparks - Only the Good News,"The motto for this book could be ""Never Met a Ballpark we Didn't Like"".While the Ballpark Book has a lot of unique photos and illustrations, the narrative leaves much to be desired. Any book that seems to gloss over the problems with Cleveland's ""Mistake by the Lake"" and New Comiskey Park can't be treated as a frank discussion. It is also hard to believe that RFK Stadium, the first of the cookie cutters and movable-stand stadiums, is not included.However, if a reader is looking for the equivalent of postcards from most of the present baseball parks and a few of the past ones, then the book can be recommended."
4,Well written diatribe,"A must for anyone interested in Swiss banking during World War II. The author has a definite point of view which cuts the Swiss no slack, which, if everything he says is true, is fully justified."
1,Another Swiss-bashing book,"This is another Swiss-bashing book (not the first one from Ziegler) to be edited. Like Hitler said ""if you keep on lying about a subject, in the end people will believe you"". The proof is to be found in other posts here that say the Swiss stole money from Holocaust vicitims. Well after four years of an independent investigation, it was found that less than 200 accounts worth no more than $12 million belonged to Holocaust victims. The Times of London correctly called previous claims that Swiss Banks had stolen billions from Jews, a ""MYTH""."
4,An excellent collection from a unique group,"This is the companion CD to 1001 Nights, Volume One. If you've got the one, you'll want to have the other: together, they present an excellent picture of this unique band.I've already posted a review on the first volume, so I'll not repeat myself here. Suffice it to say that this volume focuses on the band's output from the almost legendary ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" (which features the 23 minute version of ""Ashes Are Burning"", also to be foun here) to the disappointing ""Azure d'Or"". This wasn't the band's heyday (with the exception of ""Carnegie"" and, perhaps, the studio album ""Novella""), but there is still a very great deal to enjoy."
5,1001 nights of great music,"I own all albums by Renaissance, and would not go without this collection or Volume 1. This is a great collection to have when one just wants to hear the best of Renaissance."
2,konica minolta dimage carry case.,case advertised was leather. case received was canvas. kept the case anyway b/c i needed a case for my camera. not happy about the wrong case being shipped without an excuse.
4,Psilocybin Mushrooms,Very detailed - more complex than I thought. No real 'simple technique' in this book. Stresses many safety precautions I never thought about (serious stuff). I'm glad I bought this book before I jumped into trying to grow these guys - I could have tossed a bunch of money down the drain without this book
2,So-So Guide to Growing Mushrooms,"Some of the information is downright false and that makes the book very hard to give more than 2 stars. Not much more to say. If you want a definitive guide to growing mushrooms, look elsewhere."
5,Where to buy the supplies?,"Can someone please tell me where to buy vermiculite and mushroom spores as mentioned in the PF Tek method? I think I know where to get brown rice flour.Thanks,"
3,Good comedy,"Unfortunately Gracie Allen and Bob Burns part is the sub plot of this story. The main story is good but I wish it had been switched. Dixie Lee (Mrs. Bing Crosby) has a nice voice and a good presence. It's a shame this is the only movie with her in print. She plays a girl who has dreams of stardom only they go nowhere. Luckily she meets a struggling songwriter and the two find work together at a music shop and love. But she feels bad about her vaudeville past and doesn't feel worthy to him. Gracie and Bob track her down, members of her past vaudeville act. There is a classic scene where Gracie gets out of a ticket."
1,Original was Sliced and Diced,"My old DVD copy of the movie that I got from China had become too worn down from overuse for me to watch it so I decided to buy a new DVD. I bought this version only to discover that they cut out 20 minutes of the original movie!!!When I started the movie I thought the forward button was accidently pressed because it did not open with the scene that I remembered (and trust me I've seen this movie way too many times!). Then when I realized that I had not accidently fast forwarded to the next scene I went to the deleted scenes section and realized that they cut out multiple scenes from the movie, and the beginning of the movie was not even in the list of deleted scenes! Needless to say I was shocked and very upset that they butchered one of my favorite movies!"
2,"Good movie, *but*...","1) There is only one audio track (Chinese).2) There are only subtitles in one language (English).3) It is not HD. You can get YouTube videos in a better quality than this.4) IMDb states that the film is 113 minutes. The DVD is only 110 minutes including end credits, opening credits and company logos. Obviously something is missing as another reviewer has pointed out.Good movie, but don't buy the 2004 DVD version."
4,Andy Lau is great,"A mix of a nave pissant mentality, crime sexy action and police doing a job as good reigns over evil at the end of a tunnel a train where this a bit long movie of modern mainland China as seen by Hong Kong producers run through.What is undisputable, characters of Andy Lau are always so sexy that viewer feels even filmmakers pay tribute to actor's attractiveness by creating scripts reflecting his masculinity."
3,Content overshadowed by errors,"The book contains good explanations of terms and techniques but there are a lot of errors in it. Errors in a book for beginners is unacceptable. It's hard enough to figure out the difference between a dado and a rabbet without being given wrong directions. Take the first project for instance. The first step in the project tell you to cut the wrong piece of wood. The author tells you to buy 1x3, 1x4, etc. wood. The dimensions given for the cuts, however, are for wood that is 1/2"" thick. 1x wood is actually 3/4"" thick. Additionally, some of the pictures in the introduction to tools section are mislabeled. I haven't tried any projects after the first one. I'm gunshy now."
5,Just what I've been looking for -,This book is wonderfully accessible to someone who knows very little about woodworking. I have had trouble finding a book that I can actually understand and use. This one has helped me with fundamentals and I was able to complete the box project for a mother's day gift for my mother. It's nice to see that a company like Taunton Press respects the idea of women doing woodworking and is publishing a book like this.
1,Getting Started in Woodworking,"I read all the reviews on this book and they were all good; I ended up happy even with a couple of typos in the beginning of the first project. There was a little wasted materials and time; but, the instructions were thorough and I ended up with a beautiful box."
5,Well Worth The Wait,"My wife and I have been Tingstad and Rumbel fans for years, and their musical compositions just keep getting better and better. One of the things we love the most about Eric and Nancy's music is their ability to perfectly reproduce their recordings onstage--we've heard them perform live and their sound is unmistakable and indistinguishable from their recordings. Paradise matches the caliber of their previous CDs, but the new compositions are fresh and unique-- we've been waiting for some of these tunes we've heard at their performances to make this CD for years."
4,"This is a suprising, groovy, jazzy, and fun album","This album is fascinating and fantastic. I'm a big jazz fan, and sometimes I'm disappointed with the new stuff, but this album is an exception. I love bluegrass/country, and to see a banjo incorporated into a jazz scheme was a wonderful surprise. I love the songs here, ""Sinister Minister"" of course is THE COOLEST darn song around and funks like nobody's business."
5,Another great one,"Ok, this cd is awesome (much like all of bela's other work). The only thing I would enjoy more than this cd or any other flecktones cd is hearing them live. Get this cd. I don't care that you've never heard of bela fleck, just buy it. You won't be sorry."
5,"Fast service, excellent transaction, as described.","Fast service, excellent transaction, as described.Bela Fleck & The Flecktones"
1,useless,I couldn't find the part to hook the adapter to my device. I went to radio shack and could't find it either.
5,There is really no such thing as a universal adapter anymore. There are just too many varied ends,The adapter DOES work although I was not observant enough when finding it on Amazon that the end was a bit different. I needed to physically go to a store with the Cordless vacumn this adapter was for to find the correct connector for the plug end for the vacumn. This IS a GOOD Manufacturing change. Why should a manufacturer make 20 different batches of the same adapter just in order to have different connecting ends. The connecting ends can be found at your local electronics store. Although that said I hope Radio Shack stays in buisness for just these situations.
5,Simple explanation of living Christian Science in your daily life.,This book is a wonderful introduction to what it means to be a Christian Scientist. I highly recommend giving this book as a companion book to Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy.
2,Hard to read,"I believe this was part of a series of books written in the 1950s and 60s, wherein people of different faiths were invited to write about what it was like to be a Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, Christian Scientist, etc.Several times, I tried to read The Christian Science Way of Life and found the writing to be dry, wordy and hard to plow through. If you want to learn something about what it means to be a member of the Christian Science church, I'd recommend ""Christian Science Wartime Activities"" which was written at the end of WWII, or maybe ""A Precious Legacy; Christian Science comes to Japan."" There's a plethora of CS literature out there and based on my readings, most of it is much easier to read than The Christian Science Way of Life."
2,OLDROCKER,THIS IS ANOTHER DVD WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. I LOOK FOR CLASSIC ROCK DVD'S TO BRING BACK THOSE DAYS. I'M NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN WHAT THESE CRITICS OPINION OF ELP IS.I BOUGHT THE DVD TO SEE LIVE PERFORMANCES OF THE GROUP. NONE HERE. I KNOW THE VIDEOS ARE AVAILABLE BECAUSE THERE ARE CUTS HERE FROM THE CONCERTS BUT THEY ARE ONLY SECONDS LONG.THIS APPEARS TO JUST BE A WAY TO SELL MORE DVD'D AND STILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING! VERY DISAPPOINTING!
2,Too Little for your Money,"It was fun watching this DVD, but, as others have said below, there is not enough ""there"" there.You get star ratings of albums without any ostensible purpose to them, and you get extended opinions from people you never heard of. What you get way too little of is the music itself, or footage of these amazing musicians doing their stuff.I thought for sure that, for the asking price, you'd get full cuts of, say, the MTV-era videos. Nope. What you do get of the music is badly recorded and produced, and chopped up.Some new information here, some good things, but...nowhere near enough."
1,This DVD makes Love Beach look like a masterpiece,"THis is such a waste of my money, I actually bought another copy of Love Beach to make me feel better and try to justify again that Love Beach is an OK album, compared to this waste of a DVD ""mostly stuffy journalists' shmooze-fest about ELP"" buy Love Beach instead, at least it has ELP on it!"
5,do yourself a favour,"Undoubtedly their best album. A concept band avant-la-lettre, stylishly art directed by Ferry, that intoxicating and strangely melancholic sound: Viva! is up there with Stage, if you will appreciate the magical music-made mixture of expensive drugs, cheap romance, serious dandyism and a fair dosis of camp. Do yourself a favour and buy this all time classic."
4,Eccentric Rock Glory!,"When I was 12 or 13 I saw pictures of Roxy Music in Creem. They seemed like a gimmick band, a circus troupe, a costume party, a joke band. Then I took a risk and bought Viva. I've been a fan ever since. Out of the Blue combines everything great about The Doors, VU & King Crimson, and yet is totally original to Roxy. Pyjamerama is more funky yet relaxed than studio version & rocks harder. Both Ends Burning is THE version of the song. I give this 4 stars because it's a single record/CD (you know there is more stuff in the can). I recommend any fan seek out 1975 bootleg from NYC with a jaw-dropping version of Mother Of Pearl & other material from Country Life through Siren. Also, the 1976 show bootlegs from Stockholm, Sweden are excellent. Some of those songs can be seen in recent DVD collection The Thrill of It All. Force this CD on Avalon fans, or people who think of Roxy as a mellow 80's euro-pop band."
4,Live Roxy should not be ignored!,"Ok, let's face it: Roxy Music was a STUDIO band. That having been said, it should be noted that this document--featuring live recordings from three different years!--is more than a keepsake for purists. There is alot of raw energy around the edges here that shows another side to Roxy Music: their ability to rock out. The performances are wild and furious, with a particularly ass kicking version of ""Both Ends Burning""."
5,My Favorite Live Album Ever,"This was the first Roxy album I ever heard or owned (at the age of 14) and its impact on me was huge. Musically speaking, it's early Roxy at their finest fever-pitch intensity. The only thing that would've made it better would've been Eno on synth. It's still as powerful today as it was when I first heard it."
1,Hard to walk in these,"The shoe looks great, but it's extremely difficult to walk in them unless you like taking little baby steps all night."
4,True to size,These were really great. They are pretty plain red so if you are looking for a red shoe with a little more kick to the style this might not be it. But they are supper comfortable for such a high heel. And they run true to size- I am alwayd between an 8.5 or 9 and the 8.5 was perfect the 9 was too big.
3,kindle still 4th edition,"Star demerits for lagging kindle edition:why is it the 4th edition, rather than 5thas published in 2003?"
5,Excellent,"This is a superb summary and analysis of Fr. Teilhard de Chardin's Catholicism. Fr. de Lubac is an excellent source for Christian, Catholic analysis. I finished reading it, waited a week or two, and started reading again, more carefully this time."
1,"Too little information, not enough insight or advanced advice","This book is only useful to the beginner who has neverused Office XP applications before. the vast majorityof the book is taken up by simplistic details and factswhich would be obvious to anyone who has some experiencewith office, though they are by no means an expert.there are probably better books for beginners out there too,as the information is not laid out very well in this book,and there is too much unnecessary ""filler"""
1,Not worth it,"This is not a book from which to learn. If you have a good grasp of Office XP, this book might work for you. If you are new to Office XP, this book is a waste of time. It is poorly organized and should be avoided. The only benefit to this book is that it is thick, so if you run out of things to burn in the fireplace this book will burn for a while"
5,GREAT COMPILATION OF RENAISSANCE!,"This CD is well worth owning - especially if you can only have ONE Renaissance CD in a ""limited collection"". Although a CD it should whet your appetite for more Renaissance - perhaps in other formats. The song ""I Think of You"" which in some ways sounds like it belongs in a romantic film is, to put it mildly, simply captivating. Annie Haslam's sexy and dream-like vocals carries you to the past and back again. Carpet of the Sun demostrates that the band did actually come across quite well LIVE and did not rely on studio ""gimmicks"" to project imagery, fantasy, and imagination. I prefer this CD to the ""VOL II"" version which contains mostly later songs."
3,One not so little flaw........,"Tales of 1001 Nights Vol. 1 & 2 are fantastic samplers for a truly wonderful band, here's why I give it three stars. It needs to be remastered pronto! It sounds like somebody picked the tracks, tossed it into the machine, set the dials, hit the button and then went out for coffee and a sandwich. Anyone who might disagree with me may I just suggest that you purchase the remastered 'Live At Carnegie Hall'. This CD needs a well deserved remastering overhaul up to the highest standards."
5,A must-have album for anyone seriously into rock.,"The music of Renaissance was standard on the airwaves in Philadelphia 1971-75, when I was an undergraduate. I know that early exposure to a combination of high-energy instrumentals and the dynamic voice of Annie Haslam made me really take rock seriously. It is very unfortunate that this band has been neglected by FM rock radio in recent years, since the younger rock fans are missing music that has both energy and competence. Each piece in this album is like a symphony, in terms of the interplay of instruments. Anyone who is into prog rock should have volumes one and two of this series. Exposure may make you hunt for music by the earlier versions of the band as well. And, you won't have to buy over-priced CDs of the music produced in Japan and sold in the bi-annual record convention in the local motel."
4,Classical Renaissance!,"I have followed Renaissance since the early 70's and I must say that Annie was key to their success, but intriqued me more was the use of the orchestra and the way the themes matched so well. I have both volumes and would have given it a 5 star EXCEPT there were songs that were missing such as Ashes are Burning and what I bought this set for was for the complete Scheherazade and not just a little taste which I got. Still enjoy it though and I keep turning people onto them when I can!!"
5,A best of lesser known music,"I love Renaissance, Annie Haslam's voice is amazing, the music is amazing. I would not have expected to like classical music until hearing the Renaissance interpretation. I had the vinyl albums and now have Tales of 1001 Nights Volumes 1 and 2 CD's. When and if they ever make HDCD remixes, I will get those too. I hope this is coming soon."
4,"Review: ""Effector"" - Nettwerk","Unlike most of the previous recordiings by Download, Effector is a much more smooth listening experience. It is however not completely devoid of the usual chaos and experimentation which surround previous Download releases....Read the full review at http://chaindlk.org/"
5,just awesome,"Extraordinary! For anyone who is tired of the monotonous, mundane cookie-cutter techno. Complex, exotic, unique, other-worldly and right on. Very enjoyable."
5,AMAZING....,"OK, I was never a fan of Skinny Puppy, but I love electronic music(sounds like an oxymoron, but it's true) and I am so in love with everything from Download. Mainly I like the lack of vocals. So I'm automatically not in the ""SP loved"" crowd, but I have to admit that this is the best work Cevin's done. Still experimental, still trancey, still dancy....it's my dream come true. I really didn't think III could be beat, but I'm proven wrong....now gimme some more EPs..."
2,"Did not fit to Tilt, not slippery surface",Although it did not fit onto AT&T Tilt I have cut the edges and made it fit that way. But it is somehow either thick or the surface is not slippery enough so stylus is not comfortably used on the Tilt LCD.
4,Very good book on the 'inhouse' discussion between schools of Christian apologetics regarding methodology,"I read this book shortly when it first came out. I have returned to it as a reference in regards to the various schools of apologetics. My wife's condo (I moved in when we got married) has limited space and she purchased a Kindle for me so that I can 'convert' my library from hard copy onto Kindle. During this time of re-evaluation of which books do I like enough to re-purchase in Kindle format, I have discarded a number of out-dated books, but am purchasing- as Kindle- those I like enough to keep. This is one of them! This is not a book on apologetics issues, but of the differences of methodology of the various schools of apologetics. As such, it is primarily an 'in- house' discussion."
3,Five Views on Apologetics,"I was assigned this text for an on-line Apologetics course I'm wading through (one of the authors heads up the course). I have a few concerns...not on the context, but the presentation and the fact it was written 11 years ago. For an academician who loves to ruminate on ""perhaps then, but then maybe that"" ... I guess it is o.k. For the student on assignment, however, I find the ""responses"" to each of the five views on apologetics quite tiring. I really am not interested in the finer points of academic arguing ... ""Just the Facts Ma'am!""There are newer books on Apologetics that put the same points across with half the labor (Greg Kokel comes to mind). Let us not belabor the obvious, thereby putting the student to sleep & the potential convert ""put off"".KLH"
3,Three stars for Mr. Van Dyke Parks,"This is another strange album by Van Dyke Parks. It features a storyline, of sorts, about the history of popular music and Trinidad. The music is played Caribbean style. Not as good as Parks' collaborations with Brian Wilson, but it's pleasant enough."
5,A Real Life Safer,"Purchased after watching an NBC special tv show of how the photoelectric smoke alarm is so much better than the standard ones. TV show had a control fire in a home and the photoelectric sounded its alarm in 7 minutes while the other alarm was 20 minutes to sound. When the standard alarm went off the room was already filled with smoke. The firemen doing the test were shocked because like most of us (80%) have the standard smoke dectector in their home. The alarm must have a big ""P"" on it if it is a photoelectric. I got one for my home and my rental property as well."
4,East install,Easy install. Can't say we have had a fire so we don't really know that it works. We did test it. Loud enough
1,All three failed with false alarms within two weeks,I was hoping that these smoke alarms would work better than the regular kind.... they don't. I bought three and placed them up in my barn. All three gave false alarms in less than two weeks. They are junk. The cheap ones last a lot longer than these did. Very disappointed.
1,Constant chirping,"About a week after we installed the first one, it started chirping (like a low battery warning). We swapped the battery and after a few days it started chirping again. We returned it for a replacement, but the same thing happened to the second unit. I tested the batteries and they were fully charged. This may be just a faulty lot of detectors. We will be returning the second unit and looking for another model that we can depend on."
5,Photoelectric Smoke Alarm,I have not had a chance to test this product nor am I looking forward to the day it gets its first test.I just feel better knowing I am protected from a smoldering fire which the regular smoke alarms did not provide this protection.
3,No yet perfect,The old Firet Alert CO smoke combination with biotechnology sensor gave me zero false alarms over 10 years. I replaced it with their new electrochemical sensor for CO and already have one false alarm afterusing Lysol disinfectant.
2,False alarms when showering.,"May work fine with smoke, but goes off with shower steam way too easily. If I have the bathroom door open when showering, then I get to hear this alarm going off about the time my hair has shampoo in it... The unit is in the hallway outside the bathroom."
3,fewer false alarms,"Our previous ionization-type smoke alarm was constantly going off when we ran the dryer down the hall or fried a hamburger in the kitchen maybe 10-15 yards away. Consumer Reports says everyone should have both types of smoke alarm -- photoelectric and ionization -- to be absolutely safe but we were tired of all the false alarms. Since switching to this photoelectric model, no more false alarms. Of course, without a real fire in our apartment, we cannot say definitively how well this model performs in doing its most important work: providing an early warning in case of fire."
3,Confusing,I ordered 5 of these. I was told there would be a delay in receiving them and that was fine. Then out of the blue I received 1 and the remainder were going to be 4-5 weeks. I canceled the remainder.
1,"Great, if you like being awaken in the middle of the night for no reason","This alarm, like other First Alert/BRK products works fine for about a year, and then the fun begins. Falses randomly, at all hours. We've been awaken at least FIVE times in the past month for false alarms. No other product has the track record First Alert Alarms do. They also have an unsatisfactory BBB record. No wonder, the thieves want to charge me $6 shipping to replace THEIR defective unit. Go with another brand, unless your alarm clock is broken"
5,Works like it should,"I have owned this for 6 months or so. It works just fine, just like it should. I have it placed in my kitchen, so I was waiting for it to be going off all the time from steam, but it doesn't. It went off for the first time last night, a piece of popcorn dropped onto the burner and it smoked up and the alarm went off. Does the job!"
1,Poor Quality - Very Short Lifetime to Failure,"We replaced our oldest smoke detector, an ancient Honeywell ionization detector that was probably thirty years old. It still functioned but was prone to false alarms.The First Alert SA710 was in service for less than six months and then failed. The detector chirped indicating that the battery needed replacement, I've tried four new nine volt batteries, the chirping continues and the test button now does nothing. The detector failed.Zero stars is the appropriate rating for a safety device."
1,Useless - went off for no reason,We ordered two of these. Both were so sensitive they would go off with the slightest drift of smoke from the kitchen (two rooms away) or sometimes for no reason at all. Just couldn't see using these after so many false alarms.
1,"great product, bad price!","You can buy all purpose seventh generation cleaner for $2.99 (26 oz) at Target. This version is twice the price, .30c/oz rather than .12c/oz."
3,"False, True; Helpful, Yes","It is true that there is no actual evidence of the existence of this letter, however that does not mean we can't critique the ""spirit"" of the so called Willie Lynch Letters. For example, we can use the essence of the Willie Lynch Letters to examine how it can be juxtapose with the Declaration of the Rights of Man-1789 or how it compared with the ideas and attitudes of the Virginia Legislature of the era. It can even be used to dissect European cultural thought and behavior.Although this letter in actuality is quite possible false, it can be a helpful tool if used in the proper context."
3,Even if it was fiction,"Though it may not be real, as I've seen around, it does describe the psychology of slavery. Why deny it? While the psychology of slavery, the way locking down a person's mind will be true slavery, or labor without pay is slavery, is true. This book should be considered, as a mere study of the processes of slavery.Though this speech at the river may never had existed, this explains slavery well.Though other books should be considered, such as ""Mis-education of the Negro"" by Carter G. Woodson. And works of W.E.B. Dubois ""Souls of the Black Folk"" should be read.Interesting though."
4,Interesting,"I'm very interested in the this topic, so much so that I have decided to shoot a documentary on Willie Lynch. I would well each of you gentlemen and ladies to send me an email if you would like to express your views about The Willie Lynch Letter. [...]"
4,"It took me a year to find this book, it was worth the wait.","The Willie Lynch Letter and the Making of a Slave by Kashif Malik Hassan-El is an in your face expose of the way it was and the way that we continue to let it be. Wake up people, you were brainwashed three hundred years ago and it has not ended. The plan was so expertly executed that this indoctrination has become well ingrained in our society. We are doing it to ourselves every time we refer to someone as a ""redbone"" or talk about ""good hair"". Lets give it a break, people. Lets begin to see beyond the physical attributes that we have been taught to think is beautiful or ugly. Let us remove certain derogatory terms from our vocabulary. We need to think of each other as precious commodities that can not be wasted, spoiled or abused."
1,"Haven't read the book, BUT...","In response to one of the reviewers and anyone else truly interested in ""the making of a slave"" and how Black people have been affected by slavery, I suggest the book ""Bullwhip Days"". The authors interviewed actual former slaves as part of a government project in the 1930's. This book will show you that the identity of Black people in America WAS created and managed by the White slave masters; and will help to answer questions of why Black people today continue to have a most difficult time reaching their potential."
5,A Must Read.......................,"for any conscious black person. It's only 30 pages, and it breaks down exactly how to make a slave. It tells you the letter, and slave making techniques for the black man and the woman. Every Afrikan-American should read this book, FO, REAL!!!!!!!! You will not be dissappointed; just maybe a little angry, but your soul will be stronger.Peace!!!!!!!!!"
1,MY PEOPLE PERISH FROM THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE,"ONE THING I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS ""THAT IN NO WAY DO I AGREE WITH RACISM"", AS A AFRICAN- AMERICAN WOMAN I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTOOD CERTAIN ACTIVITYS THAT MY RACE HAS PARTAKEN IN UNTIL I READ THE WILLIE LYNCH LETTERS IT WAS TRULY AN AWAKENING CALL FOR ME. IT EXPLAINS SO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO THE ATTITUDES AND SYSTEMATIC THINKING OF MY PEOPLE. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE FREE PHYSICALLY OUR SURROUNDINGS CLEARLY SHOW THAT SOME OF US ARE STILL SLAVES IN THE MIND AND LIKEWISE WHEN IT COMES TO SOME CAUCASIANS WHO STILL POSSES THE OVERSEER ATTITUDE TODAY IN THE 21ST CENTURY.I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THESE LETTERS ARE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE GRACE OF GOD SO OUR PEOPLE (ALL RACES)CAN KNOW THE PROBLEMS AND FIND SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN SOCIETY!!!"
2,Whos that in that car bit scene?,"Why, its harrison ford's first bit part for 1967. This movie reminds me of the quirkiness of Green Acres. I think most movies from 62 to 68 needed a keen patience to watch. This is one of them."
1,Suspicious,Just thought it is a little suspicious that all of the 5 star reviews have come from people who have only reviewed this product. That fact combined with the ludicrous claims of this product leads me to believe they are all plants!
5,Small device does big work,"I noticed improved acceleration when I foot on pedal lightly,my car is running without hesitation.I think audio sound is same as before. Not big difference.The gas mileage is much better with it. It increased about 10%up on the freeway.The motor of my car burns oil and white smoke coming out fromthe back when I start engine in the morning. It disappears totally,I can't believe it! It's a great device.I recommend it strongly to buy one."
3,Nice,I love the style of the watch and the design but didn't really care for the actual watch once you flipped up the top.
3,Unique,"Well this is definatly a type of jewelry your not going to see everyone else wearing. Its stylish, and the flip up watch is an added bonus.However putting on and removing the bracelet isnt the easiest. I often find myself taking about a full minute or 2 trying to unclip it/clip it. Its annoying in a sense that I dont want to put it on unless im going out... Probably not something for everyday use.Also the watch face is a rounded square with only 4 dots (12,3,6,9) So reading an accurate time to someone is relativly difficult. You have to do alot of estimating. So if someone asks you the time, you not only have to use your other hand to flip open the face cover, but then u have to estimate where the hands are pointing...On a good note the Marc ecko holding case it comes with is very nice.Definatly a good buy if your an ecko fan. Hell of alot better to be used as a braclet rather than a watch."
4,Attractive looking ID bracelet/watch,I gave it a 4star rating because it is difficult getting it on and off my wrist. It's also a little bit heavier than I expected. I definitely like the style.
5,Beautiful,"I'm glad I found this girafle that I was looking for months!!!My baby boy can't sleep without it...I bought 2 extra to make sure i don't run out of ""girafle"" LOLVery good quality, fast shipping A++++"
3,"A great tool for learning German ""slang.""","This is a great CD for someone who enjoys upbeat modern German music. A great tool for learning the language. Packed full of slang words and fun sayings. Also, quite a mix of different styles of music. Maedchen is a great song, because I am a girl, that is why."
5,"Letters of E.B.White, Revised",I wish everyone could write as well as E.B.White! It is a great pleasure to travel with him through his life by way of his letters! This collection is museum quality art that is available to us instantly upon picking up the book!
5,Inspiring and moving,"E.B. Whites letters are honest and intimate, insightful and extremely funny. White's letters often deal with his experiences and feelings about the writing process. Because of this, I would recommend reading his letters before reading collections of his essays. These letters are as satisfying, if not more so, than any biography."
4,Useful,"though required for a class, this book has proved to be relatively useful in working through other coursework."
1,a nightmare,"I'm a costumer outside US, and the image of this playard is like the image of a nightmare for me. They sent me the playard without the bassinet and the metallic sticks and noboby could solve this problem. They insisted that they could'nt send to me the bassinet or another model. The Amazon seller of this product (Herlinda Brandt) only could give me 20 US $ credit in Amazon. After almost two weeks of negotiation with her, as a bridge between us and the company, she decided to ask me to contact personnaly the producers (Evenflo) from my country. The connection with someone that can solve our problem without paying a long and expensive foreign call was simply impossible. So we decided to ask a local handcraft worker for remaking the piece, and that is what we have. My baby has 20 days born and he has just now having his own playard, ""handcrafted""."
3,Incorrect Listing,"This looks like an incorrect Amazon listing, due to a query bug caused by two similar items with the same title. John Abercrombie's instructional Tape/DVD on Homespun Tapes is called ""Jazz Guitar Improvisation"" (and is excellent by the way, but check it's own listing), while this title refers to Sid Jacobs's DVD. Jacobs' other books are also quite good but this listing really doesn't give much information to determine whether it meets your needs."
2,Not very helpful,"If you have been trying to learn the secrets of jazz on the guitar but to no success, then this DVD is definitely not for you. Maybe come back to it twenty years from now when you're a professional. That's because Sid will lose you five minutes into the video and all you'll see is a talented guitar player showing the stuff that an amateur like you can't play yet. An instructional video is supposed to break new grounds for people watching it by carefuly explaining the chords and triads and scale patterns. Sid already assumes you know everything and frankly if I knew everything I wouldn't need a video: it would defeat the purpose."
5,I AM NOT ALONE,I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE AFTER READING IT I FELT THAT I WAS NOT ALONE AND WHAT I AM FEELING IS NORMAL. IT TOOK READING THIS BOOK TO UNDERSTAND THAT. IT MADE ME SEE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT HAS THOUGHT THE SAME THINGS I HAVE. I AM NOT ALONE.
1,Promises Promises,The CD's arrival took longer than expected maybe ten days. All I could hear was white noise. I promptly sent it back with a copy of the order from Amazon. That was about three weeks ago and still no reply.
4,Among Greatest of All Time & a Fine Translation,"Hugo was one of the greatest storytellers of all time. His stories had tight structures (with some exceptions), totally integrated themes, complicated yet lucid plots, almost addictive tempos (leading to breathless resolutions), thoroughly fascinating scenarios...My three favorites (in order) are: Toilers of the Sea, Notre Dame, and The Man Who Laughs. Of these three, Toilers is the one I most like to read over again. It is tighter than any other work by Hugo. It has the least complication (think Notre Dame, but with less complex characters), yet its climax/resolution displays the same brilliant fireworks of his other works.I have not read any other translation, but I find Isabel Hapgood's to be radiantly clear and almost poetic in its style."
1,Not standard paperback book.,"Advertised as a ""high quality paperback"". It was not. It is like an editor's proof copy - typewritten pages difficult to read, in no way should be considered what is understood to a paperback edition. This was sent as a gift and the recipient cannot read the book. Could not tell by the pictured item that it was not a standard paperback book."
1,WORTHLESS,"I found this product to be awkward. Great idea, but it did not work for me at all. It may work for others. Just not me."
4,Works great powering an on-the-mast antenna preamp,Not much to say. It just worked! I am a ham radio operator and I'm using this to power a mast-mounted antenna pre-amp.I guess it would be nice if it had a fuse.
1,bland,"This book was a terrible disappointment. Although it is clear that he knows something of painting in watercolors, the samples given were bland. Spread across the entire page that blandness became stifling. This book would work for a true novice but any one else should steer clear."
4,One word - Dense,"I loved the story but could have done without the (to me) senseless interludes and some of the repetition that was included in the tell-the-same-scene-from-different-perspectives style. Another problem I had was with certain levels of technology that were definitely out of sync with the times - even by today's standards that would be tough (I don't want to spoil it for future readers).If you like tough reads, similar to Pynchon's stuff, I'd say try this for sure. The setting and characters alone made it enjoyable enough to be worth it."
2,"Complexity, Thy Name Is Lawrence Norfolk","I tried, as a reader interested in historical fiction, to finish reading this novel.One of the cover blurbs describes it rightly as complex.It might also be described as sleep-enhancing."
5,A unique masterpiece.,"Because I lost my copy this summer on a plane in Brussels, I'm going back to Europe to buy it this summer. Find it, buy it, treasure it."
2,Falls Short of Eco-ian Glory,"Great reviews and an interesting, rarely touched premise (the East India Company) led me to pick this up, and I wish I hadn't. While at times the style is enjoyable, more often than not it is merely annoying. If you're interested in history-rich conspiracy fiction, pick up a copy of The Name of the Rose and re-read it!"
5,Utterly captivating,"Akin to Pynchon, I think, Norfolk is definitely a master. I loved the conspiracy, grotesquery, and wicked wierdness that is this novel. Once read, it can never be forgotten. Ancient mythology forms a tapestry of clues for young Lemprière, who struggles to make sense of his mission from within a cabalistic underground society whose hermetic and dangerous agenda contrive to weave an ever more convoluted yet fascinating web around him. Exciting and wonderful, there are very few novels such as this."
5,"Stunning, beautiful, elegant, confusing, brilliant","[I read the English edition] This book is hard, but well worth the concentration needed to get through it. It was a surprising book from start to finish. I never knew where it was going, or how it could end, not until the last minute, so to speak.I couldn't possibly describe the whole book, and I wouldn't want to ruin the plot twists. There isn't a pigeonhole to fit this into, either - historical, biographical (perhaps not!), fantasy, thriller, romance... there's something of all of those in this.If you feel like a challenging read, and if you have the stamina for a long book; if you have an open enough mind to enjoy different types of book, grab a good dictionary and get stuck in.Superb."
5,Great,I purchased this for my neighbor she loves it. I am thinking of getting one for myself. Thank you Amazon
2,Yet to discover where the greatness is,"I just made a first batch of juice on my newly arrived Champion Commercial Juicer. Perhaps I had too high expectations for the masticating juicer as I've mostly used Breville brand which I love (centrifugal). It was dissapointing to see how much juice was still contained in the pulp and how much pulp seeped into the juice itself. I am not particularly crazy about straining my juice after it comes out of the juicer. The feeding tube is so tiny you have to quarter an apple for it to fit in. Not as easy to clean as Breville either, even though it's definitely a plus that you don't have to worry about the pulp collecting in the juicer and can go on indefinitely. At least that's what I hear. Still my main qualms are the fact that it takes a rather long time to juice on this juicer and the quality of the juice itself, I like mine as free of pulp as possible."
4,A savage 60s beat that makes one forget the 90s.,"This Bethlehem, PA-based band provides a savage beat to a number of rare 60s covers, as well as original tunes. Its impossible to dance to today's tunes...the Creatures change that with their constant drivin and rockin beat! The DC5 had the Tottenham sound, well the Creatures unleashes your heart and soul with their own unique sound. This CD is well worth the investment. Today's bands...just don't get it. They're forcing us to go back to the roots of rock n' roll. The Creatures will bring a smile to your face and some spunk to your feet!"
3,Stephen Hurren from London (UK),"I read in a music book that this album reached number 35 in theamerican charts. Although the first three tracks on it are good, plus ""Everyday"", the other favourites I like form it are ""Only One"" and ""The Man Who Shot The Liberty Valance"". ""Mona"" is about JT killing a pig. And I don't think that song could have made many people happy. I'm not overkeen on it either."
5,The title song is FABULOUS!,"Love James Taylor's smooth style....and the selected tracks for this CD. The title song is absolutely GREAT; words, music and delivery!"
3,Definitely soothing,"I am a huge James Taylor fan. ""That's why I'm here"" is another collection of similar sounding songs. The title track, song for you, only a dream, everyday, and only one are great songs. Musicianship is great on the album, a little overproduced, and a few covers. If you have a best of collection, you might want to overlook this CD, asside rfrom the tracks listed it gets boring. The remastered version is a slight improvement over the original. I enjoy putting this on wheni need some soothing."
5,I Love Now Brand,"WhenI managed a Health Food/Supplement Store I discovered Now Brand. These are the only vitamins I have taken that I can say that I truly feel a difference in my energy level and mental clarity. I've even tried the really, really pricey ones and didn't really find much difference. From my work at that store, I learned not to take the cheap drugstore brands. Too many health professionals told me that they don't dissolve in most people and just pass right out of the body. I also learned that NOW brand is family owned and don't spend a lot of marketing so they can keep their costs low. They have a high criteria for quality and produce excellent vitamins and supplements. I don't know if any of this is still true, but the NOW products I buy seem to hold up their quality.The problem with NOW, though, is that they are hard to find in retail stores. I was thrilled to see that Amazon carries them."
1,No difference noted,I was expecting to notice a big difference inenergy level and am very disappointed in this product. Will not be reordering.
5,THIS IS SORT OF AMAZING,"Most people think of Nostradamus as the French seer who foretold events of major coincidence centuries in advance of the actual event taking place. We all know that Nostradamous foretold of World War I and II and even described Hitler's rise to power.What most of those who have read Nostradamus do not realize is that he was also a great psychic who could predict the future of individuals whose path he crossed. Some were royalty -- kings and queens -- but no man (or woman) went unnoticed.This book is sort of a Nostradamus Code which enables the reader to take their dreams and attribute numbers to them. Apparently, Nostradamus studied the holy scriptures as well as the Kabala and so he was a master of numerology.I tried a couple of the personal predictions in the book and they worked better then I had expected. When you consider there are several hundred books on Nostradamus out there, at least this one is a bit different."
4,Great read,Great book about a little discussed period of time.A piece of history that seems to be ignored but extremely important to our present day experience.
5,Worth every penny,"I've bought this book 3 times already, every time I get a copy I give it away to a friend as a 'must read'. Rich characters, gripping story, and amazing action. I tell everyone that some of the things that happen in this story are so amazing that if you saw it in a movie you'd dismiss it as unrealistic and fake, except it is real, and really happened. Any fan of the period of knights and chivalry and life-and-death struggles should buy this book with confidence...it delivers."
3,"Good Information on Construction and Destruction; Definite Bias, though...","Those who romanticize Akhenaten probably won't like this book. I consulted it as a reference piece (especially regarding the construction of the temples and the methods of destruction) and found it extremely useful, especially when paired with a timeline of Akhenaten's reign.Dr. Redford was one of the directors of the Akhenaten Temple project at Karnak. This book gives an account of the history of the period, outlines the construction at Karnak and the fate of the buildings. There is a good historical background given.At the end, though, Dr. Redford lets loose with his uncensored view of Akhenaten. I believe he uses the description 'smiling weakly' at courtiers. He also makes some interesting points regarding his interpretation of the worship of the Aten. I enjoyed his diatribe, but it might have been better said elsewhere.The book is informative and well-written. People who idealize Akhenaten may wish to give it a miss."
1,The worst book on this historical period ever written,I'm a scholar in the Amarna Period and I have read almost every book about this period. This is absolutely the worst. And this is a pity since it doesn't do justice to its author who is a famous egyptologist. It seems that here Redford wants to discharge all his personal hate towards the period and the characters under discussion. This is certainly not the best book to start with if a layman is interested seriously to start and begin with Amarna studies.
4,Question explanations please!,"Just in case you didn't know, I thought I should write a review to say that there are no explanations of the questions. All of the answers are, of course, given, but they aren't explained. So, even if you are convinced that it's (A), and the back of the book says (C), it doesn't tell you why you're wrong. Nevertheless, taking loads of tests is absolutely the best way to prep out there. Basically, those thousand dollar courses are for people who don't have the motivation to buy these books and do it themselves. So, if you want to save money and know you can force yourself to take these practice tests, I highly suggest that you do so."
4,Official LSAT Preptests: 10 Actual by LSAC,"It's just another book of exams. It doesn't include the 5th section -- the ""variable"" section of the exam."" Would be 5 stars if they had explanations too. But I guess that would be asking too much, right?"
5,Melodic pop at its greatest,"Tam Tam Go has had an intersting career in its twelve year history. They started singing in English and in doing so managed to be ignored by the Spanish public. Thier fourth album ""Vida y Color"", however, was entirely in Spanish and is one of the most beatifully crafted and produced pop records that I own. ""Nubes y Claros"", their latest work is also all in Spanish and revisits some of the themes and styles in ""Vida y Color."" Nacho Campillo's writing style is melodic and versatile and his singing voice is trully unique. The ballads and more up-beat songs are all first class. He could be described as Spain's answer to Paul McCartney, in his prime. The quality of instrumentation is outstanding and the production value is flawless which creates an overall great clean sound. If you like melody, good writing and great production, this CD is a must in your collection."
5,Mostly Table Runners,The pattern book has many different ideas and was easy to understand and I will use it many times to create beautiful gifts for friends and family!
2,not what I expected,"The singer is has not the same level as Josh Groban.First you have the vocal versions and than the karaoke versions.On the CD the other way around is written.On the karaoke version there is an awful tambourine by ""You raise me up"""
2,Pure Eye Candy,"I'm not gonna lie, This game looks amazing. It truly shows how nice the PS3 can make the games look. Although a few people say the characters look like plastic. It still shows off the great resolution.The Bad and the reason why the 2 stars.The game play is horrendous. The game focused so much on ""fancy"" dunks that there is no defense playable whatsoever. The instant you go for a dunk, YOU CANNOT STOP IT. I've made dunks over 4 people all jumping. The game looks amazing but if you want to have an all around basketball game. This is not it."
2,Pretty Bad Basketball Game,"Although I can't imagine anyone being interested in this game anymore, if you are thinking about giving this game a try I highly recommended that you don't. I know it's pretty cheap at the moment, and if a cheap basketball game is all you're looking for, I would try an older 2k or NBA Live game. Way too easy, a lack of good game modes, boring gameplay, and the fact that it's offline now are some of the problems this game has... However, the graphics are pretty good, and it's quite easy to just pick up and play. So, if you're looking for a cheap and easy basketball game that you can play quickly with friends, I guess this wouldn't be a bad option."
1,Save your money,"Pros- Good graphics- One of few games to support 1080p- Mini Games are fun especially the shoot outCons- AI is horrible. You can have 3 defenders in the lane when a defender gets burned and they just stand there and watch as the opponent goes in for a slam- Shot meter needs to be tweeked- Passing needs work. You can pull your controller up to the left and hit the pass button trying to get the ball to a wide open teammate and it will pass it to a guy behind you to the right.- Too many slam dunks, had 12 dunks in a row in one game- Limited number of set plays (4 on offense and 3 on defense)- No defensive controls expect poke at the ball which 90% of the time just gets a foul called on you- Season mode is a joke as wellOverall- One of the worse sports games Ive played in a long time, its a sham that this game was released in the state it is in."
1,Too Much Repetition with this disc!,"I thought that this album was kind of a bummer because after the 3rd track it all sounded the same to me. Yes i admit that the tones are cool but they're songwriting is not anywhere as interesting as other bands of the genre - namely the Untamed Youth, Boss Martians, MOAM, and others. I feel that this album was not sincere in its attempt to do vocals like the aforementioned groups. More like they were forced to try and do them. I do like their album Savage Island a lot as it seems natural - this one does not. ronni"
1,Uninteresting and BLAH,"This is what you call a book? Not only was it boring, it was self absorbed. Many people go through life with ""not so perfect"" childhoods. If you're going to write about it, at least keep the reader interested."
4,"A True Man-frustrating, inraging,adorable,arrogant,etc.","Thur is like real males, there are times you want to bash him over the head, make wild love to him, throw him out of your life, spoil him like a baby, pray for understanding, and so many other emotions that the males in your life evoke in you. (As a wife and mother of three boys, I can tell you that they can drag you through many emotions in as little as an hour.)Personally, I have a thing againest adultry and had trouble with Thur's free and easy body sharing with his female guards, especially when Angels was pregnant. I had trouble accepting his excuse that it was for her benifit as much as his own, I find it hard to understand her falling in love with him after all that. I do know love can be strange and anything is possible. The author did a wonderful job crafting her story and the storyline flowed smoothly and was believable.I'm looking forward for the next adventure and to read more about Shylar and the ""tiplets."""
5,Good deal,This boot dryer is great. Low heat slowly dries the boots from the inside out. It's nice to turn it on to warm up the boots before I head out into the cold too!
5,Excellent Product,"Everybody needs one of these. There great for drying wet sneakers, boots, etc. I should have bought these for Christmas gifts. A+"
5,Great for sports shoes of all types,I bought this unit after my motorized boot dryer stopped motoring. I'm a snowboarder and play soccer and it works great for both boots and cleats. No more musty boot smells. I also put my wet gloves on it. Makes washing tennis shoe much easier. Buy at least one but you may find you'll want 2 or more. Great product.
5,Gets rid of the smell,"The Peet Shoe Dryer works as advertized. My canvas topped shoes develop a strong smell ( actually STINK )from my sweating in the summer time.After wearing them during the day, I put them on the Peet Dryer in the evening and by the morning they have dried out and the smell is gone.Well worth the money."
1,Poor Structural Design,"Since buying this item, it has probably been used less than twenty times for drying boots. It works OK as a dryer, if you are very careful and/or don't put heavy boots on it.The base on this unit is two-piece (to allow shipping in a smaller box). The two plastic pieces are dovetailed together with insufficient reinforcement or gusseting, and the base broke on both sides where the pieces were joined. This is a very poor design.If you do buy it or already own it, I would suggest sanding the edges of the base where they meet, and thoroughly epoxying it together. I couldn't find any epoxy, so I used five layers of aluminum tape over the joints.I would not have bought this model if I knew it would break in normal use; and, I would look carefully at how the base joins, if you consider another model with a two-piece base."
1,Tricky Sales Tax,Peet Family Model Dryer M97. I ordered this item on the Internet and it arrived quicker than expected. It is quiet and appears to work well. I bought it because I had planned to buy an expensive pair of work shoes and instead of buying two pair to alternate each day I bought one so the dryer would have them ready for another day.The buying experience was the worst. The shopping cart experience was unusual. I was charged sales tax even though I ordered the product from another state. I was given the final price and then afterwards was charged sales tax (per the receipt) because it was shipped from a company in my same state. This was not mentioned up front and I have lost all interest in the company and its products.The company did not respond to my emails regarding this extra charge.If you need a shoe dryer I recommend buying it locally to save $8.00 shipping and just pay the legitimate sales tax.
3,"Okay, but could be improved with an on/off switch",This device is great for drying out and keeping fresh running shoes. Its one major flaw is that it does not have an on/off switch or on/off indicator light. You must plug/unplug the device every time you use it. Despite this drawback I find it a useful product.
5,Love this boot dryer,"My husband loves this boot dryer. We just bought one for his fatehr to. It is great for all the time, even in the summer."
5,provided a very merry Christmas,My brother got this for Christmas and I was Green with Envy so bought my own just now. He went through it and read it at random from place to place and had the whole family laughing aloud. My favorite was the teachers notes like My daughter was sick so I took her to a Dr to have her shot. I nearly wet myself laughing. I can't wait to read the rest of it I have a feeling it'll leave any audiance shreiking with laughter.
5,We laughed so much we hurt ourselves.,A true side spliter. I've yet to meet any one who can actually sit down and read this book. We all end up laughing until we cry. Anquished English has become famous with everyone who's attemped to read it. It's the best giggle ever
2,Getting last year's calendar was a mistake,"Looking at the order again I realized that this was the very same as last year, and why not? It was last year's and I had seen all of it already. But I had opened it and it was what I ordered and so I kept it. It seems the 2013 canendarssold out if they ever existed."
4,"Good, but 2011 was better","What makes Lederer's calendar so special is that the errors usually aren't just ""Engrish"" or cheaply funny typos. He spots all sorts of instances where people unknowingly use wording that allows for multiple, highly amusing interpretations. These are vastly funnier and more satisfying, for reasons I can't quite figure out how to articulate - I think you really need to read a few of them for yourself to understand. I had the 2011 calendar as well, and I thought he did an amazing job with that one. 2012 unfortunately resorted to cheap laughs too often, although there were still a lot of gems in there. I plan to buy the 2013 calendar, but I'm crossing my fingers that it's closer in quality to 2011 than to 2012."
5,Good chuckling available here,I have truly enjoyed this collection of language blunders and have given it as a gift to several friends and family. All seem to find it as amusing as I do!
1,More of the same,"This book was as disappointing as the author's other books I have tried to read. I seem to be continuously fooled by what these books seem to be, or what they cold have been, and am brought up short by what they actually are. In this case, a pedantic jaunt through junk e-mail type one-liners. I hold a college degree, studied English and creative writing, and am not illiterate, as another reviewer claims those who dislike this book must be. Perhaps my expectations are too high...a book should be entertaining?"
4,Relax and laugh.,"I found myself laughing out loud a lot while reading this book. Dr. Lederer is on KSFO talk radio here in the Bay Area the last Friday of each month. Any question you have regarding proper grammar. origin of sayings and phrases he will answer, since he has a wealth of knowledge. And what he doesn't know for sure he will find in his extensive reference library."
1,An anguish to read this book,"This book is mostly about errors made by the author's students when he was a teacher. I was a teacher myself, so I guess I can crank out a turkey like this and get paid for the dumb things my students had written. This book is filled with the common errors you would expect from students in any grade level (or from the average person who was educated through the American public school system). Besides students, the author uses other sources to fill the pages, but nothing of historical importance.I ordered this book because it seemed interesting. Within minutes of getting it, I was wondering if it would be worth the effort to return a $6 book."
3,authentic happiness,ordered the book for a summer school elective course. didn't read the whole book. the book isn't inspiring and didn't make me happy
3,too much info makes it Confusing,"This book has a lot of information in it. However, it is just too much for the book to be very useful in real life. I found this book to be one of the hardest to look up a quote or piece of information later. Which really negates all the useful information in there. If you can't find it, it's of no use. And it was absolutely packed with quizzes. I personally like quizzes, but I could not get my husband to read a word because it was too quiz-oriented. I recommend ""Learned Optimism"" over this book."
2,Figure It Out Yourself,"I was disappointed by this book. While on the surface it looked like a great exercise, after reading it cover to cover and going through the exercises, I found that I came out not knowing anything new about myself.Save your money and just go to the website and do the exercises. I think there are better ""get to know thyself"" books out there."
5,Leading the Way to a Happier Future,"Marty Seligman is the leader of the emerging field of Positive Psychology. Finally, psychologists are focusing on what works instead of what is broken. In this highly readable book, the author shares the latest research on happiness and what creates it. I suspect many of the negative reviews were written by pessimists and traditional psychotherapists whose voodo therapy probably does more harm than good. Its true that this is a new field but its significance could change the course of the world. If we all focused on creating positive emotions instead of material wealth, we could transform Earth into a happier and more sustainable planet. Thanks Marty, the people of Earth need your leadership and compassion."
4,long live positive psychology,"For years psychology has been about problems. And imho not to much use for the average person, as psychology most of the time weren't better than your wise old aunt anyway (most of time worse, actually).Basicly, psychology dealt with a lot of more or less welldefined problems, which it then thought about curing. But psychology had little to say about life as it presented itself to the average person. By dealing with the relationship between positive emotions and win-win situations, and speculating that we may be on the threshold of an era of win-win games and good-felling - this book comes along way in making psychology interesting and relevant for the people of the 21'st century."
3,Just another psych book,I only purchased the book out of curiosity about the 'tests'. Other than that it has some good points but over all its like all the rest of the 'self help' books- just a new wrapping on the same old probelms.
4,About meaning of life,"Your book has provided concrete steps that can manifest our happiness in life. Thanks for your great work.One thought about the chapter you have discussed about the meaning of life, that something which is bigger than our selves.Our true nature itself is that something bigger than life and oneness with the universe. And it is beyond our mind and body. The meaning of our life, in my thinking, is to grow and to learn to reach that ultimate truth of life and serving people to do so in the process. And that state of truth is peaceful, perfect, and luminous."
1,Dangerous Pop Psychology Claptrap,"Shame on Dr. Martin Seligman. Following in the footsteps of Stephen Covey, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer, he has abandoned legitimate science and moved into the touchy-feely realm of self-help psychology, by appealing to people's thirst for easy answers to difficult life problems. Having been down that road many times with the aforementioned authors, I suggest avoiding said road like the plague! Life does not offer easy answers. Changing attitudes and behavior is hard work, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan.By contrast, Dr. Aaron Beck, the founder of Cognitive Therapy, is a brilliant scientist - I repeat, SCIENTIST - who built a school of psychology one brick at a time - through careful research and testing. Dr. Beck NEVER gave people a false sense of optimism. Seligman on the other hand wants to reap the rewards and achieve celebrity by appealing to people's mania for easy answers."
2,Tentative thoughts.....,"Admittedly I have not read this entire book in depth or done all of the excercises. I have skimmed it , read parts and done a couple of the excercises online just in case I found it to be worth the 26.00 dollars.I didn't. All in all it seems to me to be a quasi-religious,fuzzy notioned, naive tome of utopian collectivism.But what do I really think? Well for one I don't like his seeming endorsement of fundamentalist religion as indicitive of a superior method for happiness. This seems like the old ignorance is bliss arguement to me and he seems to endorse it. I'll take a little pessimism over arbritrary conformity and ""playing by the rules"" just to not encounter any ""unhappiness"".I think the cognitive guys have more to offer as in David Burns ""Feeling Good"" books and Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Therapy oriented books.One can bear a little unhappiness in the search for integrity and self-respect even if it means bucking the system and not being ""Positive Polly""."
2,Extremely helpful and full of useful practical infomation,I really enjoyed this book. I am a Counsellor and a Coach and have already had several opportunities to relay some of the information in it to clients of mine who in turn have found it concrete and easy to understand. There is a very good section on children that all parents would do well to read.
5,Intellectual & Insightful,"Despite the fact that the field of Positive Psychology is new to me, Seligman managed to utilized his extensive intellect of the field & delivered a readable & insightful book. Along with various tools at the book's website, 'Authentic Happiness' offered me a lucid perspective about the power of positive choices; it also altered the way I view myself & others in a positive manner."
4,Most well researched self help book,"Martin, a well respected psychologist and researcher offers an enlightening book that has qualities of a self help book yet is very well researched. At the same time it is very personal. I would have liked it better if he didn't evangelize at the end, it all works from a secular point of view too, and this ending was a surprise. Not enough to negate the rest of this fine book."
5,excellent,"Having studied in psychology for a few years, I find this book refreshing with new ways of improving and increasing our happiness level. I plan on reading it again and again.I find it very interesting."
5,must read,"Looking for help or just a good read? this is the book. Practical, informative, beautifully documented and researched, but not overly-scholarly. A sort of practical handbook for those interested in the subject or pursuing a better state of being."
4,Happiness it is!,"I used this book for a course I took and it was very informative. I enjoyed learning about how to evaluate one's frame of mind and look at things in a more positive light. Using our core strengths is definitely a must, in order to live to our full potential."
4,New-to-me research and perspectives,"While I can't say this book has profoundly changed me, it definitely has provided fuel for thought, and one I would recommend, particularly when he shares data about what is (e.g., that about 50% of our emotional 'set point' appears to be genetic) and what could be changed (e.g., some of his exercises that can increase positive feelings). Too many of the other authors that other reviewers have mentioned are touting their own thoughts, not necessarily research based. I liked his distinctions between the various domains of positive emotions (past, present, and future), and how they need to be looked at differently. I didn't care for his agnostic/atheist stance, but I found it easy to ignore. At times I found his habit of alternating between scholary writing and 'dear diary' style irritating; at other times interesting. I certainly would follow his recommendation to take the various tests online, vs on paper. I've found the online email newsletter to be of interest."
3,Thin on substance,"Yet another case of a book with lots of filler when a journal article would have been quite sufficient. You can summarize the essence like this: ""To lead a fulfilled life, you need to identify your strenghts (take a survey on the author's website), and use them as often as possible during work and play. 'Flow' will ensue often, and with it lasting contentment.""Stuffed in there a few chapters on child rasing philosophy and nuggets of the author's worldly wisdom and academic career.As for the Kindle edition: PLEASE, editors, is somebody looking at this before it goes out on sale? Formatting errors where the text uses just half my kindle screen, and the typos...? If ""editing"" is the reason for why ebooks have to be as expensive (or more so!) than paperbacks, for Christ's sake EDIT. Don't just auto-process scanned pages and leave the reader to fend for themselves."
5,As a physician,"As a physician who has treated clinical depression and anxiety the past 16 years, I have studied the best of pop psychology [Burns, Peurifoy, Bourne]. The standout feature of Seligman is that he is able to take high level scientific data and incorporate it into his lay literture. It provides for a strong argument in trying to convince the reader of the topic a hand. Also, Seligman is able to provide us with a progression of any of his previous written work. So 10 years ago, he presented us with ""flexible"" or learned optimism. Now, he has acquired enough data to back-up that basic concept and lay the foundation for the whole new field of ""Positive Psychology"". He truly is a visionary in this field. And yes, he most likely will succeed in cultivating a new branch of psychology."
2,"Tedious, tough to focus on.","I am a big fan of Seligman's work, but this book could not hold my attention for more than 60 seconds. This is unusual since I am a nut for such books. Needs to be presented in a different way."
3,A starting point,Not what I was expecting. I thought it would have more science and studies. Thought it could be much shorter. But did give me a starting point for further research into the field.
3,So who can be against being positive?,"Professor, ""no mind"" embraces authentic happiness and authentic pessimism, unauthentic happiness and unauthentic pessimism--and all such things apart from your Buddha Nature. In saying what you have said, you have said exactly nothing. Herr Hitler apparently found great contentment in knowing his strengths and actualizing them. I think he was utterly convinced that what he was trying to do was for the good of all and profoundly positive."
1,cruel fake emotions,one should be prohibited to sell garbage like this. good only for the pockets of the one who aimed at reaching poor souls and tested on poor dogs. SHAME ON YOU MR!!!
4,Cute,"I bought this book for Father's Day. It's cute enough, and shows the characters involved in activities besides the usual tools-and-sports type things. My toddler likes the shiny pictures."
4,My favorite songs.......the Russian medley,"I have all Deanna's movies and the gorgeous Russian medley is my favorite of all the songs. Also we have delightful character actors as butlers who cannot help Deanna enough in her new maid's job...Akim Tamiroff, Hans Conried, Si Jenks, Alam Mobray......In fact, I'm only negative about the leads....Pat O'Brian (not funny at all, it should have been William Bendix) and Franchot Tone who looks ridiculous and acts worse. Rarely did Deanna get the leading men she deserved.Very interesting to see Every Sunday as she sang like an angel at the tender age of 14."
5,Excellent children's book about choices,An excellent book about how attitudes and choices can lead to very different results. My kids loved it. Best for ages 4 to 9.
5,EXCELLENT CD!,"Outstanding addition to my 27CD-25cassette REBA collection! I have seen REBA in concert two times and would love to attend the GIRL'S NIGHT OUT show this year. This cd has all the hits I have on other cd's, but I try to buy any REBA cd to add to my collection.Buy it where you can find it. You won't be sorry that you did."
2,Poor manufacture,"The concept is cool but, with mine at least, the sheath doesn't fit the blade. It's too tight, making it almost impossible to draw and, when you do, the abrasion wears off the characters on the blade. It also annoyed me that the wood was splitting where the blade joins the handle. The natural wood is nice but I think it should be stained or varnished."
4,AOA Wolverine,"Nice. Love it and most of all because the BAF parts to complete GIANT MAN. Now that's a great deal considering this is a TOYBIZ action figure, now hard to find. Great"
4,Good Gift,"Christmas present for my brother: the redskin's fan. I tried it on it was surprisingly comfortable and warm. He has had comments to the same effect as well. He likes it, I like it, good stuff."
3,Disappointed but still using it,"I'm a little disappointed in the the speed that Shanna breezes through these instructions. Even her ""slow"" girl is just whipping right through them. I HIGHLY recommend that you sit down and watch the workouts first before trying to do them. Also, not really sure where there is burlesque dancing. All I saw was more modified 'club/workout' dances. I just wish there was more burlesque moves."
4,fun and easy to follow workout.,This workout is fun but it repeats itself enough so you can catch on to the moves. It's a fun way to get in your daily cardio!
5,Love it!,"This is the best dance dvd and I have many. It's very much like a class you would do at the gym as you learn the moves as you go. If you like Zumba classes at the gym (that play current music and not just the Latin tunes) then you will enjoy this dvd. There is no slow break down of moves and then you finally do the full routine at the end like most dance dvd's, you learn simple, fun routines and learn them as you go at pace. This is a great workout, fun to do, awesome music. I hope Jazzercise comes out with a series of these Burlesque dance dvd's. Maybe other instructors/companies will catch on that this is a type of workout that is truly lacking in the current market. I enjoy the Zumba dvd workouts, but just get tired of the Latin music - it's a nice change to dance to songs I know and they are ""current"" not oldies or some weird electronic music you have never heard of that's cheesy or bad. This workout will make you want to get up and dance!!!! LOVE IT!!!"
4,Fun but Fast,"I am middle-aged, usually do walking exercise DVDs (Sansonne), and get bored easily. Since I am also somewhat out of shape, I chose to do the quick workout first. There are 4 short routines which are fun to do and the moves easy to learn. But.....it is very fast. You start off with a very nice and unique warm-up and from that point on there is no slowing down. I've only been able to complete 2 of the 4 routines - not because they are difficult to follow but I'm more out of shape than I thought. My advice, if you are new to this kind of dance workout, watch the routines first and try out a move or more at your own pace until you feel you've got it down. I jumped right in and tried to keep up with the pace while doing moves that I never had done before. I ended up with a slight strain in my lower back because of bad form. All in all, a fun workout with good background music and motivating instructor."
1,Fails to work on computer,"While the music is good enough, you can listen to it ONLY on a cd player. Using the cd player in ANY computer results in horrible noise, making the disc unplayable. So, this is a complete waste of money. This was true for the first disc and for the replacement disc that was sent to me. Out of hundreds of CDs I have bought, this is the only one with this problem -- DO NOT BUY IT."
4,"""Frannie and Tasha"" return","As most of you know who read my reviews, I am a library specialist in music at a medium sized library. A couple of years ago a woman came up to the desk and said that her husband was looking for a CD by ""Frannie and Tasha"". The children's librarian and I were desparately racking our brains for a children's CD by that group until we heard him say"" 'no, dear, these two guys play the piano"" and realized he was looking for anything by Ferrante and Teicher! I am so pleased to find this Christmas CD in yourcurrent list of holiday music! I have been a fan of F & T for more years than I am going to admit here,and am always looking for their CDs for my library and my own collection. Thank you!"
4,romantic and spicy,"I love this CD. Anything Hossam Ramzy does is always beautiful. The combination of flamenco and arabic music is beautiful and double edged. Of course, Spanish Flamenco began with the influence of Arabic music. Beautiful."
5,Dewalt DW2535 Countersink Set,"I bought this set after breaking several countersink drill bits bought at major home improvement stores. Those bits would break after drilling 3 or 4 holes in my composite decking material. I used one Dewalt countersink bit to finish my project, drilling about 50 holes. The Dewalt bit still looks as though it has not been used. I highly recommend this countersink set for any project involving composite decking boards."
4,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR...,"These bits do a great job. I'm about to buy spare drill bits for the set. True, there are cheaper versions. I've destroyed several. The ""cheaper"" versions have set screws that strip out quickly, or spin because you can't tighten them enough."
2,Speed lock pulls off.,The speed lock attachement at the end is only pressed on and comes off after only a few times of use. you can still use the bit as a regular bit but in a chuck but it doesn't hold as well as the hex lock end. I'm am the second person who bought this same set and had the same problem. I will probably replace the center tapered bit with a regular bit and continue to use the countersink but I most likely won't buy these again.
2,Mixed feelings at best,"I have been using these bits on red oak for a project today. They work fine if I am drilling through 3/4 in boards but when drilling into end grain the fluting does not clear out quickly enough and then they discolor and come out with burnt material and smoke rolling off. This happens less on low speed for my drill, on high speed it is near flames. Happens on my cordless drill so I tried my drill press and had the same result. Again, pre-drilling the boards and countersinking them the bit is great as for going full depth in hardwood - not so much; I went back to a regular bits. Also note, when using the drill press - raising the bit out of the hole 3 times during drilling minimize the burning as it cleared out the bit - that is not the intent of this for me since it was meant to be used on a cordless drill."
2,just ok,I bought these bits at the local home depot. I was happy to see counter sink bits that were reasonably priced. But unfortunately they are weak! light duty only folks. nice set but be careful with them.
4,Must have product for cabinet work,"when you want the screws to flush with the wood, you need the countersink bits. One of those ""must have"" helpers."
5,Countersink Drill Bits,Best product on the market for predrilling and countersinking. Works great with Grabber screws. Perfect for hard woods. Very durable.
5,Nice Countersink drill set,"I have used these countersink sets quite a bit & they do an excellent job. Have not had any trouble from this set at all. I have used these bits in hard & soft wood, & they do a good job for countersinking the screws. Highly recommend."
2,3 pc. Countersink Set,"The drill bits are to long if installing screws less than 1"" unless you don't mind a hole on the other side of your work. It would be of benefit if the manufacture provided different length drill bits in the kit."
5,Excellent Children Book,Perfect for children to understanding Valentine's Day. Dj in new glassine has tiny chips but is all there. 53 pp. Cindy is new in school and would like to make friends. She makes her teacher a blue valentine for her teacher-it's the teacher's favorite color! It is a pretty valentine and the teacher asks Cindy to show the other children how to make one! Directions are in the back of this book to make Cindy's valentine.
3,One of the song is good but the sound quality is extremely bad because it's full of noise.,"I bought this CD from Amazon because I like the song called Tornero. It's melodious, sentimental and engaging.However the sound quality is extremely bad because it's full of popping and clicking. Obviously, no digital re-masting has been done. Ugh!"
2,"The Hipster Spies With His Mystic Eye, Something That Begins With--Ahh...no.","The Hipster wishes he could give this a good review, but there is too much background sound effects used here, compromising the music.Also, the artists cannot seem to decide if they want to play Modern Exotica or Surf Music, often changing their minds in mid-song.Alas. I was rooting for them, but they let me down. :(The Hipster regretfully gives this a Thumbs Down."
4,Required reading for anyone that wants to trade,Great book that goes into detail about traders psychological downfalls and how to recognize them as signals. A must read.
2,A psychiatrist filling a book and naming it for traders,"Trading successfully is about maturity, discipline and knowledge. That's it. This book goes on and on basically repeating that. Listing examples of patients (non traders) who the author helped with their personal problems and then drawing analogy to trader's pitfalls. If you're good at decision making in general, disciplined and like to work hard and learn always, then you most probably will make it in the markets. I wouldn't recommend this book on a trader's shelf. You better off reading ""Come Into My Trading Room"". It asserts the same concepts without filling a whole book for it. It's not too bad for a casual read though but I wouldn't pay over $40 for it."
2,How Abraham Maslow became a trading coach,"THis book should be titled how Abe Maslow,the father of Humanistic Psychology, became a trading coach. If you agree with the idea of Humanistic psychology that every person has a strong desire to realize his or her full potential and to reach a level of ""self-actualization when people experience ""peak experiences"" those high points in life when the individual is in harmony with himself and his surroundings, then you should get this. I don't see how that works in a trading environment and is a rather simplistic view of psychology in general and so I give a pass. Far Far Better is thePsychology of the Stock Market (Classic Edition)andTrading in the Zone: Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline and a Winning Attitude; two books that will actually help you in your trading. /TKL"
1,Brutal,I really tried choking this book down but just couldn't do it. I made it about halfway through before I finally gave up. I'm sure what he is saying is true and I'm sure some traders might be helped by this book. If you are a trader with mental issues you should probably read this. But if you are a good trader then deep down you already know what he is talking about and don't need to force yourself to page through 300 pages of mostly boring re-hash with only occasional humor or insight to be gleaned.
1,Don't let these reviewers fool you,"In case you didn't notice, these other reviews are from the author circuit. I believe the practice is called log rolling. You review mine, I'll review yours - what a cozy little circle j***. Are any of them successful traders? Apparently not. Part-time prognosticators who have something to sell. Don't think that some nitwit psychologist can help you with your trading. Successful traders come in all shapes and sizes, and no amount of counseling is going to help you."
1,"Please, not another trading psychologist","I knew there was trouble when the author decided to give himself a 5-star review before anyone else read the book. Maybe he doesn't realize that there's a bubble in psychologists who think they can help losing traders. I don't think there's anything more weird than a half-trader, half-psychologist. If they're so good, then why aren't they full-time traders themselves? You'll find the typical ""trading is war"" analogies and hey, look at how those professional athletes train! Guess what folks? One of the best traders I ever knew was a fat guy from Brooklyn who chain-smoked like a chimney. One of the biggest myths is that anyone can be trained to be a trader. That is BS - most will fail, and this book can do nothing about it."
5,It's all about Psychology,I believe that this book will be of interest to everyone who is interested in Psychology.Whether or not interested in trading.The author was able throughout the whole book to capture my interest and attention. I continuously found myself immersed in the book.His approach is funny and interesting; the real life stories are highly educational where anyone could relate to or knows about someone who could fit the picture. This makes it easy to use and to take the advice and turn ones own life around.I strongly recommend this book to any person who is considering taking up trading or is trading already. This is a must read before any technical or fundamental book.It is absolute great value for money.
3,Three and a half stars,"Overall this is an interesting book. There was a sense of deja vous, particularly in the first fifty or so pages because some of the material presented is similar to Alexander Elder's trading books. (The author does make a single reference to Elder)What I found particularly interesting is the proposal to create different outcomes when faced with a particular emotional episode. How to go about doing this, I'm afraid, is not quite so clear. Especially since this book has a 'storytelling' feel to the author's counseling sessions with the students he helps.Maybe this is his edge in the markets which he is lothe to share?I don't think so.However, in saying that, as traders you'd want an edge and understanding how psychology and techniques like anchoring and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) can help you is executing that edge may prove to be useful."
2,"I Agree With ""Overrated""","The author seems more interested in telling you, through wordy examples, what a wonderful therapist he is. The book could be 1/4 the size and still be just as useful. Do yourself a favor and get Trading In The Zone instead. It's a lot more comprehensive and direct (and helpful) at addressing trading psychology issues."
5,One I re-read as often as possible,"If you know anything about trading, you will be aware that a large proportion of your success will depend on your trading personality rather than your trading system.In this definitive guide to the psychological aspects of trading, Brett Steenbarger brings together his expertise in psychology and trading in a series of useful examples that outline the numerous emotional barriers to successful trading.This is one book I try to re-read as often as possible."
1,Waste of time,"Yes, I read and understood that this was not ""THE"" Korla Pandit. But I bought this CD anyway based on the two prior reviews and I was looking for fun background music for a ""mic-century"" party; specifically Tiki or Exotic Lounge.Not sure what this is meant to be...a joke...a badly executed satirical take on Korla Pandit...or just some poorly made ""tribute"" to KP. Whatever it is, it does not do justice to the grandfather of exotic lounge music.Don't waste your time or money."
1,not good,this is not the toy of my past. The spiral doesn't stay in place and is way too hard to use.Played with it once and only got frustrated.
3,That's an interesting name,"This is the ""soundtrack"" to the Dick Tracymoviestarring Warren Beatty. But none of the Madonna songs from the movie are here, and only a few of the songs here were actually heard in the movie. The songs are done in a 1930's style, to match the time period of the film (except for the three ""bonus"" songs done in a more contemporary style). There are some good songs here, and some not so good songs. It's a mediocre album, and that's about all I have to say about it."
3,fine costume,"hat is a bit thin and flimsy, but my son was in love with this costume from the moment we saw it online!"
5,Easy product to use,This is a great product for anyone who has a cat. I can't brush there teeth so these do the job.
2,Just not a match for my dog,Trying to use these are like trying a toothbrush. My dog doesn't especially like foreign objects in her mouth. Also the mechanism of snapping one side and letting it drain to the other swab tip doesn't work great. I could be swabbing my dog's teeth for 5 minutes and it seems like a lot of liquid is either coming out or being used fully.
3,"Effective, but fragile","I got this product to protect my Kohler ceramic sink. It does a nice job of protecting it, but the coating on it is easily cut or damaged by the items placed in the sink, thus allowing rust to develop quickly in spots. It also stains very easily and it is hard to remove the stains. So, it doesn't look good for very long. I replace my every 6 to 9 months. Not a cost effective product."
2,Way too expensive!,"OK, it matches the color and shape of the sink perfectly. But somebody should point out to the manufacturer that it is NOT gold-plated, even though it is priced as such. If there was an alternative product, I would switch."
5,Perfect,"I ordered this to replace the exact same style rack, but the old one was white. The stainless steel rack looks great in the white sink, and I'm sure it will last longer. I'm so glad I found this on Amazon."
5,Perfect fit,"The only thing bad about this product is the expensive cost. I guess that is to be expected, since it is a brand name part replacement. We'll be far more careful in the future about putting hot pans in the sink to wash (they melt the plastic coating)."
4,Nice replacement,"We replaced the 18 year old version of this basket. The 2009 version is very nice. Less bulky and sits lower in the sink, but still does the job. I had to buy the drainboard in order to get the plate rack which used to come with the basket. Otherwise, we are very happy with the new products."
2,"A good idea, if it works","The mower works for about 10 minutes, then stops and display Recharge Battery. I did charge it as per the Instruction (leave it always plugged to charger) but no matter what I can't get more than 10 min out of it. Well, in 10 min it doesn't really do anything useful so it is completelly unusable. Because of its size it is not easy to ship for testing or service, I still don't know if the battery was given to me dead or if the charging in mower is broken. There is very little help offered and whatever I do with it will be expensive.My toro gas mower works reliably for years without any service or guesswork.I agree that it is a great idea, but it may not work as advertised."
2,Who needs it?,"It's cute and more or less works. The yard has to be perfect for it to work well. If I have to police the yard and make sure a wheel can't be trapped or a water hose mangled, why not just mow while I'm at it. The controller is at the very bottom of the A.I. scale, but my wife likes it. After this summer, maybe I can sneak it onto E-bay."
1,Great idea.....,"Great idea for a product......Horrible follow through...I purchased the robomower and brought it home to set up. I spent a full day pushing stakes in the ground setting up a zone. When the time came to realease the robo, it kept going off course...hmmmmm. I call the comapny and they have no idea (also no idea how to speak English) what is wrong. Then after ten call backs they figure out that my zone is too large (not in the instructions). So, I spend another day to set up a three zone configuration. It works for one day and the next day my robomower is in the middle of the street, while my neighbors laugh at me...In summary, this a great idea with potential but the company and support are horrible...Think of it as Windows 3.0."
5,ACE IS THE BEST!!!,ACE IS THE BEST CHRISTIAN PUNK THE LYRICS ARE GOOD AND I CAN HEAR THEM AND I AM NOT A PUNK FAN BUT THIS IS GREAT.
4,ports of paradise,"Thank you Amazon for making it possible, Never dream I could recapture this awesome music of my pass. I taught my young children to sing and dance to this music in the 60's , for my Grandmothers 80th Birthday, and this year It's my 80th Birthday and I am thrilled to recall this very beautiful music, Another big big thank you, the service awesome the condition same as 50 years ago. AWESOME AWESOME 5 STAR all the way I'm thrilled"
4,martians! my boyz!,This disco rawks and if ya lookin for the SURFING STUFF then GET IT! I'm one hardta pleeze man but I LOVES dem Boss Martians! It ain't my favorite BM's stuff tho - the best stuff is on vinyl only so get a rekkurd player if ya ain't got one and get their other stuff on wax - its da best.
4,"Fun music from the ""nice guys"" of the surf scene","Need a drastic antidote to all the negative garbage filling the airwaves? Look no further! Of the more than 100 surf and instro bands I've discovered in the last 4 years, I rank THE BOSS MARTIANS in the Top 5-- no easy feat! With 4 albums, several singles and an ever-growing number of appearances on compilation records, they've managed to carve a niche for themselves by having probably the ""nicest"" sound I've run across in ages. 13 EVIL TALES is my favorite of their CDs to date, with highlights being instros ""Hot Foot"" and ""Double A Growler"" as well as the vocals ""Gonna Have Fun Tonight"", ""Mean Model A"" and ""C'Mon Jenny!"" As an added feature, anyone in need of a laugh should hear ""Long Hair Lenny"", in which they skid into Stan Freberg territory-- sort of. Have fun!"
5,DEWALT DW2569,"I bought this bit after seeing a video about installing kitchen cabinets online. This bit works perfect, line up the cabinet faces, clamp them, drill through the frame, and attach the countersink screws. It saved time and aggravation through the whole project. Great idea for a great tool!"
5,Very useful tool.,"I bought this and the 11/64"" size also. They make it very easy to start a hole on pencil drawn center lines. And I like the double set screws to hold the drill bit. I wish I had bought these a long time ago."
3,An okay place to start . . .,"Judo Techniques and Tactics provides the beginning Judo student a decent place to start. Pedro only reviews a few basic moves and throws, chokes and joint locks, and counters. They are moderately described in text and illustrated fairly well with photographs. This gives the beginner a good subset of techniques to work with and start to master. The book has a good overview of competition and some helpful tips on conditioning. Judo Techniques and Tactics should be useful for those in the sport less than a year."
2,"same old, same old","This book could have been written by some Japanese 50 years ago. Pedro does not explain tournament throws or tactics. Even the throw seen on the cover is not included in the book. It is a shame. A competitor with such experience could have ""sold"" some of his knowledge in a book printed in 2001."
1,Fogless?,"Although these goggles are presented as fogless, they are not. I call to complain of the quality and had no resolution. The women's/men's vanquisher is a better product for the $."
4,One comfy pair of swim goggles,"I do a lot of swimming in between classes at University. These goggles are very comfortable, don't leak on me, and reduced the ""eye-ring"" that I have experienced with other cheaper goggles. Nice when you have to be in class right after a swim. They are great at reducing glare in outside pools on sunny days, and the interchangeable nose pieces make custom fitting a breeze."
1,"One 4"" hole then dull","I had only two holes to drill through 4"" of mortar. Barely made it through the first one before the drill dulled to the point it would not cut anymore. Very disappointed with this product."
5,The Best,"One of the two or three* best records I have ever heard. I return to it again and again. Uplifting and sad and liltingly happy in equal measures. Shirley Collins' outstanding voice is strong and true. Listen to the melodic beauty that underpins the tragic sadness of the words on Banks of the Bann or Van Dieman's Land. History. You'll understand the fundamental English connection with traditional Irish and traditional American ballads. Such quality. Such depth and musicianship. And variety, and inspired innovation for it's time. Perfection.* and . .Stormcock - Roy Harper (beyond belief)"
3,beware later edition,"Be careful which edition you buy. The original version of 1956 has few words, each essential to the simple, charming story. The 1984 version adds words that clutter up the story line. Example: 1956 -- ""he dug some worms, and he put them in a can, and he got his fish pole. Then off he went with his fish pole."" Perfectly clear accompanying the delightful drawings, and close to a child's imagination. 1984 -- ""He dug some worms and he put them in a can. He got the long tree limb that he called a fish pole. He put the pole over his shoulder. And off he went."" The insertion of the adult point of view diminishes the appeal of one of my favorite early childhood books. It's still a great story, so if you're not familiar with the older version, the wording may not bother you."
5,childhood memories,I had this book as a child and wanted my 4 year old grandson to have it as well. Book is still relevant today and he gets a big kick out of it. Book is hardcover.
4,"Great for adults too, especially if you retire early!!","I am 29 years old and read this book when I was a child...I am building my own internet business and plan to ""escape"" the employee world. When I retire early, I am going to give a copy to my employer as if to say.....""the little fish that got away...."""
3,Bonasi Book,"I am new to working with the plantsthought the book would tell me care , planting , and answer my questionsbut for me it did not."
2,Bonsai?,"Those of you who are like me and think of bonsai as a containerized tree may be disappointed in this book. Virtually every ""history"" contains the phase ""I planted it in my yard for ??? years."" To many of us that phrase would classify this book within the gardening section, not creative arts.On the other hand, the trees are beautiful bonsai masterpieces well photographed.Come to think of it, maybe I should hurry home and plant some of my trees in the yard."
3,Good concept,The only problem that I have with this is the size. My gloves (womens Large) have a hard time fitting on them. I worry that they will be forever stretched out. My Kids gloves don't even come close to fitting.
3,Not good for small gloves,"This is probably great for large bulky gloves, unfortunately I got it to dry out slim fitting women's garden gloves. No dice."
4,Ingenious product.,"The PEET Glove DryPort Attachment does a pretty good job. It will dry a wet pair of gloves overnight, but doesn't quite get the warmth all the way to the fingertips."
4,Worthwhile Accessory To An Excellent Appliance,This accessory does a terrific job of directing warmed air into each finger. It works far better than place the gloves over the shoe attachment.
1,Disappointed Shopper,I order the Peet boot dryer. It is a good product. However the page also advertised Peet shoe and glove dryer accessories. There is a picture of glove dryer extensions as well as wader extensions right beside each other. I ordered this product as well and was very disappointed when I only recieved the wader extensions. Why would you put the two pictures right beside each other on the website if they are not sold together. This to me is false advertising and has turned me off from using this site again for on-line shopping.
3,Nothing Special,"I purchased these to go with my PEET system I received for XMas. They did not work as well as I'd hoped for smaller gloves. I was realy hoping to use them for my kids gloves after playing in the snow all day, no such luck. I have not had the need to use them on adult gloves. I think if the gloves fit it might work OK.Not for use with Ladys or Kids gloves."
2,Cheaply built,"Jaws aren't polished or even smooth. Machining marks clearly visible. Sharp edges where jaws were milled out. Not much relief around heads. Defects in plating. Size marks stamped in shallowly instead of molded. They do the job, but they're not much fun to use."
5,"Get drunk, really drunk then listen to this CD.","A true renaissance man, Skip Heller continues to create wonderful soundscapes. Surrounding himself with passionate musicians, Skip brings us a commanding collection of jazz tunes. The highlight for me, being the luxurious 'Young, Gifted and Red' - the perfect antedote for a 3AM hangover.If you can find it, check out the CD by Skip Heller and author John Gilmore (Severed, The Garbage People). Heller's music and Gilmore's stories on the sleazier side of 60's Hollywood are a true gem."
2,Baroque Lute Music on the Guitar? NO!!!!!,"Being a huge fan of S.L. Weiss, I was given this recording as a present. The work by Weiss is excellent but performed OK and the rest of the CD is pretty dispensible. Weiss wrote only for the lute and his music should only be played on the lute; playing it on the guitar sacrifices the depth and warmth that the lute offers. Please purchase with caution."
5,I really enjoyed this book!,"This book was so great! I loved learning more about the septuplets and the pregnancy! I seriously could not put it down! I think it was a great example of an incredible family with a great amount of love, patience,and Faith! I recomend it to anyone who loves babies or who just needs a good book to read! IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD!!!!!"
3,It all about the Mc Caughey journey,"""Seven from Heaven"" is about all the hardship of the McCaughey family. I thought this an okay book, but not excellant. This book is for the people who would like to know all the information on this family and their dreams."
1,"Awful, disappointing and expensive product.","Pay heed to all the comments above from the previous reviewer - also read the epinions comments. They're on target - stay away and save your money - if you want good sound quality for the price I'd go with JVC. May look cool.. but the reception, sound quality and functionality are worthless. Plus extremely frustrating to operate and the instructions are very confusing.I wonder if Phillipe owns one of these..?"
1,Not Worth One Star,"Worst book of all time, sorry guys and gals but whoever wrote and edited this book should buy a book themselves ""Learn to Write and Edit by DUMMIES"". To many typo's and script errors which did not work!Actually I would give the book a 5 star rating if they changed the name to Trouble Shooting Script Errors, Test Your Skills!"
3,drill bits,i was dissaponited in that i htought they were 6 inch drill bits instead 3 or 4 inch bite because i needed a little longer bit
5,Very nice replacement filter,I installed this on my BMW X3. It fit perfectly and had a better seal around the perimeter than the dealer installed filter. Very pleased. Quality is very good.
2,Wrong photo as A9,"I bought this model to replace an A9 that was stolen.This is a poor substitute, for the A9, definitely not up to Senco's reputation. This appears to be a budget model. I use this tool weekly, I drive alot of 12d and 16d casing nails, they get jambed in the head, this never happend with the A9. Is probably fine for framing nails, hanger nails etc. I wishsenco would stick to quality tools only, not the budget market."
2,try another brand,"Those of you who contract remodel jobs know just how handy a palm nailer can be installing Simpson hardware in those hard to get at places. In the 2+ years that I've put this tool to work it might have driven 8000 to 10,000 Teco nails. It's given up the ghost. In my collection of pneumatic tools the Senco brad nailers are among my favorites but this little unit disappoints me. Probabley made in China or hecko en Mexico. Try another brand."
4,Easy nailer,"This palm held pneumatic nailer is quite satisfactory. It is particularly well suited to the task of nailing joist hangers, working overhead, or to other situations where the framing configuration limits the range of motion of a hammer. It certainly is not suitable for high productivity and not a replacement for a gun."
3,So very disappointed,"The product description of these towels really lured me in. Very pricey, but I took a shot as I needed a quality pair of large towels. They are nice, ok really, but after I paid for them I found the exact same product (same size, thread count, pattern, etc.) at my local Walmart for one-half the freaking price. HALF! I felt I had been taken by a slick sales pitch. The other reason for withholding stars is that I had to compromise on the colors. I really wanted Black, not a pastel-version of black (""charcoal""). Bottom line, I live and learn and will not repeat this mistake."
5,Amazing!,"If you love surf music and surf music with a Polynesian twist then this is the album for you. The cover art (by Shag) and the music combine to form an excellent album that you'll swear you must have heard in the late 50's or early 60's, even if you weren't alive back then."
3,TRIBAL/ ISLAND SURF ROCKS !,"Well this is by far the best bomboras album to me, it has a great mix of surf and exotic island sounds. Sad to say this is the only bomboras album that I like the others are average. Some problems with this cd is the bad recording and 2 or 3 of the songs are dull, but most of the others have a cool sound. If you want to buy an album from these guys then only get this one."
5,Awesome item,"For those interested,this item is 90% Cobalt-60 and can withstand a pressure of 14,850psi (Think about an elephant).It glows green in the dark and black in the light,adding a fancy look to your living room.Minor issues :My PS3 isn't working anymore and my TV is showing some weird old indian movies on all channels...You might also want to keep your pets away from it,my cat has shown some signs of discomfort as soon as I opened the box.Edit: My cat is dead but his body is glowing...!"
1,"Great price, but cheap quality.","When I saw the price, I thought it was just too good to be true. It seemed like a mistake, how could this thing be found so cheap? Sure enough, the price was right, but let's just say you get what you pay for. There is a reason this is not $1,000,000,000 like the next model up. Flimsy construction, very few diamonds, hardly any gold.Go with the TV-SB Plus model, you'll thank me later."
3,Not quit as good as expected for the price.,"I was going to replace a cheapie Radio Shack amplifier and several splitters with this one splitter/amplifier. Well, the reception as worse that the original configuration. I ended up returning to the original setup. In that application I was hoping to use it just didn't work. I would thick twice before purchasing one."
1,Not very good.,"I bought one in October and am now searching for another phone. There are problems when someone calls, it disconnects after two rings and there's a lot of static."
1,Dead On Arrival!,"Well, I had high hopes that this would be a simple, easy to use, reliable, good quality phone . . .WRONG! It was dead and hopelessly so. I called Panasonic's service number and they offered a few obvious suggestions and I followed all of the troubleshooting tips in the instruction flyer that came with the oh-so-dead phone. No luck! I'm trying again and have a replacement (same model) on order."
1,Panasonic Big Button Phone,"I bought this product for my father who is going blind from macular degeneration. I thought the big buttons would be easy to use. They were, however the phone lacks the ability to be programed for numbers that he uses regularly."
3,"Not his best, but still pretty good","I dont care what you say, Ice T is (still) one of the finest MCs out there and could kick 2Pac any day. when it comes to lyrics no-one beats the Iceman. Return Of The Real, Ice's first album since 93's classic 'Home Invasion', is not the best example of his talents. some of the beats are too jazzy for me and the songs just get boring. the ones that really irritated me were 'How Does It Feel', 'Inside Of A Gangsta', 'Forced To Do Dirt' and 'Dear Homie'. The best tracks were 'The 5th', 'Syndicate 4 Ever', 'They Want Me Back In', 'Make The Loot Loop', 'Return Of The Real' and 'Cramp Your Style'. this one is basically for die-hard Ice fans only, unless your collecting all of them. If youre a newcomer to Ice T, I suggest you start with the Greatest Hits or O.G Original Gangster. In my opinion those are two of the best rap CDs I own. Later.............."
2,Not one of Ice T's better albums,"Within hip hop, I'd give this 3 mics. In the world of music, 2 stars. It's got some nice lyrics, especially by the Mexican rappers, but the beats lean too far towards R&B. Home Invasion is a near classic because of the hard beats and fresh lyrics. This sounds too produced. I think Ice T fans will get the most out of this. Ice T focuses too much on realness, and not enough on politics and old style west coast hip hop, the style he's suited to. But then I've only got two of his albums, so what the f--- would I know?"
4,Don't sleep on this album,"This is not the Iceberg's best effort (I think that award easily goes to OG) but it is still a hard album. Lyrically, (as always) he is on top form the whole way through. Production-wise, the album is lacking a bit, the beats are not the best to be found in an Ice-T album. It is still a solid album and I recommend it to anyone who likes Ice or rap music. Don't sleep on this one!"
1,Postmodern Drivel,The essays in this book attempt to explain the recent popularity of J-horror among Japanese and America audiences but they are simply too dense and full of postmodern jargon to be effective for use in any class. I was hoping for more discussion of the influences of Japanese folklore and supernatural stories. Also reveals the anti-American bias of academia (Battle Royale II is superior to Saving Private Ryan for courageously re-enacting the fall of the World Trade Center towers!). Avoid unless you really are into this kind of reading.
5,DeWalt's DW054 14.4v Impact Driver,I have used a few impact drivers in my day. Just recently I purchased the new 14.4v Impact for work. I am very impressed with it power and vesatility. I just hope I can stop myself from using it all the time.
5,Lifescapes: Celtic Mystery,"The entire album is absolutely marvelous. It's a great, soothing CD if you find yourself stressed. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Celtic music (Or needs a musical vacation!)."
4,When I thought all was lost...,"I bought this album originally on cassette more than 10 years ago, and loved it. Due to a car wreck that also crunched many of my old cassettes, I thought it was lost forever since Target no longer sold it. I got a slightly used one here on ebay for a third of the original price! Still love it!"
3,mixed feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this book. As a coffee table book it is lovely and well done, but as a reference book it is lacking. I found it frustrating to find beautiful photographic portraits of people who happened to be wearing a charm bracelet in the picture, but no close-up of the bracelet itself:- a cherished bracelet left behind by a 911 victim is briefly described, but we don't get to see it except as part of a portrait.- a collector of 19 (!) silver charm bracelets is shown wearing them all at once in an indecipherable mass, and we are told she and her husband collect the charms during travels. I would have loved to see the bracelets closely, as a window on the owner's personality, and record of travels.The book does have other good views of bracelets and lots of historical information. I am happy to have it, except for a few frustrations."
5,Beautiful and Interesting,This book is filled with interesting information and beautiful photographs. It's perfect as a coffee table book as you'll want to look at it again and again.
5,Quite....,"I like the music on this CD better than either of Lindsey Buckingham's other CD's. Don't get me wrong, the first two of his solo CDs are good - I enjoy listening to them. But Out of the Cradle has a very different sound to it. It's got less of the synthetic, busy sound of some of his other music. It sounds cleaner and more of a blending of his earlier musics. There is a peace to it, along with an edge. In a sense, it's a more complex sound with less of the needless frills."
5,A work of genius,"Lindsey Buckingham's ability to craft, play and produce exquisite pop songs is beyond question, but this album really showcases the talent of one of the most underappreciated geniuses in popular music. Sure, Buckingham has been widely recognized and praised as the architect of the Fleetwood Mac sound during the band's heyday, but that work never allowed him to demonstrate the full range of his talent. This album never quite caught the imagination of the listening public like it should have, probably due to the quirkiness and rather dark tone of some of the songs, which is a shame. This is truly an album that, despite its high initial appeal, improves with repeated listening. There's just too much going on to take in at once. Bravo!"
1,Where's Stevie,With out Stevie Nicks Lindsey Buckingham is nothing. I have all of her solo albums and I wanted to give Lindsey a chance. He has only had one good song since Rumors and thats Big Love. If he was smart like Christen he would retire
4,"Challenging, intelligent music.","Buckingham's talent is easily seen in this solo work. Lyrically dark, the haunting music makes the disc a tough listen the first time through. But you will be rewarded by repeat hearings where the songs complexity become more clearly understood. Challenging music is a rare quantity and should be appreciated when it presents itself."
4,"probably closer to a 3.5, but still...","now this was a pleasant surprise, another album purchased for the sake of my wife's nostalgia. but around the time we got it, i was absolutely in love with fleetwood mac's tusk, and band member lindsey buckingham had everything to do with how bizarre and wonderful that album is. so i gave his last solo offering a big wide open chance, and he surprised me. this here is a genuinely caffeinated record. it induces hopping and pose-striking. spiked hair, parodic billy idol sneers. at every second you have no idea what the next second will bring. it's like a house of mirrors, this one. it seems like whatever style buckingham wants to take on, he does with some degree of success. which makes the randomness less aggravating and more exciting. allmusic calls his style on this album ""electro-acoustic"" and i can totally dig that...powerful riffage and delicate complexity all spun into one."
1,meandering book,"writer has meandered from his original subject and ends up taking armies of india from 1857 onwards.that has left him with little space for his original subject. Maps are brilliant and have been filched from operational history of j & K operations by riaz ahmed.(now unavailable)There are factual errors also on distribution of regiments between india and pakistan.Overall,official version needs overhauling."
4,"Do what you can, with what you have . . .",Kentucky Woman certainly seems to epitomize Roosevelt's famous quote. This book is so historically real that you sweat when reading about the summer days. I couldn't help but appreciate my carefree world compared to Viebie's and many times wondered just how many of my relatives she may have known due to geography and time. I enjoyed reading about a true Kentucky woman and the strength that she possessed. So many people today are so self-absorbed that life's lessons are lost but we could all learn something from Viebie.
5,Not a fun read,"Good book recommended by a client, but not a fun read. I think every American should probably have this book on the ""must read"" list, but it is not a feel-good book."
5,Must buy for xzibit fans,"Great lyrics, beats...much better then MVM machine...a big improvement...the best songs are LAX, Cold World, Klack, and Back to the way it was..."
3,(3+half stars) not X's most dangerous weapons!!!,"In my opinion this isnt X's best work by a long shot. However its still better than alotta albums out at the moment which shows how weak hiphop is these days. The beats aren't as hard as you usually get from X and some of the lyrics are monotonous+sound like stuff from older albums. Its like he's not raising his game that much any more. Too many tracks here are like fillers rather than thrillers such as ""sat.nite live"",(awful) ""ride or die"",(weak) ""crazy ho"",(X's not on it) ""scent of a woman"" and ""klack"". The remaining tracks are more of what we expect from the X man. ""LAX"", ""muhf**ka"", ""beware of us"", ""tough guy"" and the amazing ""hey now"" are the true highlights. Add them to ""cold world"", ""judgement day"" and ""back to the way it was"" (3 different BUT tight tracks from X) and you've a worthwhile addition to any rap collection. As i said not his best work but its still hot for those 8 tracks."
4,X to the Z is back,"X's new cd is def a good cd i think its better than man vs machine but not quite as good as restless cuz it dosent have the production that restless had but still a hot cd.Best tracks are cold world,mutha*****,judgement day,criminal set,and tough guys with busta all of the rest are ok but those are just the standout songs....so def go pick up a copy cuz its worth it"
2,"Just like Iraq, no weapons found.","This is definately the worst album X has put out to date. Comes weak on almost all the tracks. Hey Now made him a hit he sold records, i bought one. The trick worked on me."
1,"leave this one for the 2pac, eminem, and (r&g) snoop fans","when i got this album i thought ""i can drink a whole hennessey fifth, some call it a problem but i call it a gift"" but all i got was a half-assed album. wack and lame beats and his rap style has not evolved at all. its like he thinks he can profit on this album just cuz hes big timing it on tv now. you can tell hes not focused on the music, and who wants to listen to that? unless you're an xzibit groupie pass this one up"
2,"Not bad, Better on vinyl.",Not bad. I think it sounds better on vinyl. The beats seem to be cleaner. Maybe it is that vinyl just works better for me than cd.
1,This was horrible!,"With the exception of a song, maybe two, the whole album is garbage. This is almost as bad as Ludacris's Red Light District. The lyrics are trash through the entire album with maybe one good beat on the entire album. The best thing I could say about this album is that it's consistent, unfortunatly for us, it is consistently bad throughout."
1,Terrible,"By far the worst Xzibit album I've ever heard. Is it me, or are artists these days getting worse and worse? 40 Dayz & 40 Nightz was an awesome album, as well as Restless. I dont think I was able to tolerate 30 seconds of each song on this album. They were all terrible. I have a feeling Xzibit is going downhill from here."
2,Reruns of Pimp My Ride is better than this crap,"I was expecting much better from X now that he hosts Pimp My Ride. But I was wrong. Includes the Neptunes-produced single ""Hey Now (Mean Muggin)"". Other than that, ""Criminal Set"", the Busta Rhymes-featured ""Tough Guy"", the anti-Bush intro ""State of the Union"", and Muthaf---a are the only good tracks. Guest appearances AND production are terrible. His new group, Strong Arm Steady, is more annoying than Cam'ron and The Diplomats, to say the least. Save your money and continue to watch Pimp My Ride and cop any other Xzibit albums; I would recommend Restless or Man vs. Machine, which each have MUCH better tracks, producers, guest appearances, etc."
2,STILL HASN'T REACHED THE PINNACLE,"Aside from ""40 Days, 40 Nights"" and ""Restless"", X to the Z has basically wasted his talent. His latest, ""Weapons Of Mass Destruction"", while better than his last, is very inconsistent. There isn't one banger out of 16, and only a small handful are decent. The few standout's, {Hey Now, LAX, Tough Guy}. Another problem was the lack of known guest spots. Tha Liks are replaced by some whack rappers named Strong Arm Steady who flow terrible. Only buy this if you're a fan of Xzibit. Non fans, stick to watching Pimp My Ride..."
1,Is it Crap?,"My friend bought one, and out of the box it only shot 10 feet. Im not joking. But he said he modifed it and it shoots a bit better.Plus, this thing is small and i feel like I can smash it in my hand."
2,some problems,"The actual sweep was of good quality, similar to what I've used in the past. The screws were brittle, however. Half of them broke while installing. I substituted sheet metal screws which worked just fine. Since it is not necessary for the color of the screws to match the sweep, that's OK. It might be best to avoid this in a situation in which the cosmetics matter--or be very ginger in using the screws."
3,Came in damaged,"Was sent in a box too small to fit item so was twisted and bent to fit in. Box looked like it was intentionally sent to appear damaged in shipping.. Although a quick measure showed that the box could have never held the whole length. Fortunately was able to heat and bend back into shape, and cut off the damaged end when fitting to door."
4,"Great ""no frills"" phone","I've had this phone for about two weeks now, and so far, I love it. I've had cordless phones in the past with lots of extras like dual keypads and speaker-phones and I never used these features. I don't use caller ID and I have a perfectly good answering machine. All I wanted was a good quality cordless phone that couldn't be easily over heard by neighbors baby monitors. I got just that. This phone has incredible range, excelent sound quality, and great battery life. The DSS gives us peace of mind for security too. The only fault I can find with this phone is the speaker hole for listening. It's very small and is located high up on the handset. Beacause of this, it's easy to let the phone ""ride up"" while you're talking and it sounds as if the volume is dropping off. Just pay attention to how you hold this phone and you'll be very happy with it!"
3,Save your money on this one.,"Maria Monk turned out to be a homeless prostitute and con artist who was taken in by the nuns at this convent and provided with food, clothing and shelter. When it was discovered that she was stealing from the sisters during the day and still peddling her goods at night, she was kicked out of the convent. Monk rewarded the sister's generosity by trashing these nuns in her then famous novel. If you enjoy religious fiction, you can probably find this one at your local library. Save your money."
2,Unless you like to gamble; please read the reviews first!,"I admit, the picture quality of the MDP-1810 is great, atleast when it is working. I had to return two of these units to Costco. The first one had a faulty d.c. adapter. The second one played one DVD perfectly fine until it stopped working. I exchanged for yet a third one, which is having problems playing discs containing .mp3 files. After reading the reviews, I am definately returning this thing and avoiding Mintek products like the plague!"
2,oh It is not just me.,"I just purchased this as a replacement for the one I bought in April 04, I had the 7 inch screen which just went bad on me, just a total black screen, I heard audio but no video so luckily I found my receipt and Costco returned it. But now after reading these reviews I will not open this new one and return it. thanks."
4,Great Value,"I bought this for the long 8-hour drive to the in-laws w/the kids w/out the hubby. It has excellent picture quality and all the accessories you need for the car and home. It fit perfect between the seats on an Explorer with a little help from the rubber-webbed contact paper holding it pretty good. It did not fit my in-laws Subaru passenger car, so we put it on the front of the back seat w/double-sided tape.I found it to be a little sensitive to minor scratches that our normal players do not pick up. So besides the pulling over to start over and select the scene after the skip, it was a sanity saver."
1,ripoff,"Misleading ad. Rude response from ""smith"" Amazon is the only reason I did business with ""smith"" When I complained about quality to ""smith"" I received numerous nasty emails. Amazon and 'smith' will not have me as a customer."
1,"Can you say ""JUNK""?","If anyone provided a review for this item right after playing it the first time, they would have written a glowing review. So would I. But I have only used it ONE time for a plane trip. When I just took it out of the case for the second time, the thing will not play. When you insert a disc, it just makes this awful noise and then says ""no disc found"". Regardless of what dvd is inserted, the machine does not work. It was used not more than 6 hours tops. What a piece of trash it is."
1,Loved It........Until it Stopped Working,"Bought mine at Costco over the holidays. Worked for a few days and loved taking it with me during my daily commuter bus rides. However, I started getting the dimmed display everyone has talked about. Sometimes, removing the battery pack and putting it back on worked, and other times plugging it into the AC adapter worked. One time though, I spent a full hour fiddling with it to no avail. Returned it to Costco for refund.Other notes: Picture quality was average and you can't fast forward or rewind on the unit, but for the money, the shortcomings were acceptable until the picture started to go out.I cannot recommend this product. I'll have to wait on a DVD player for a while because all other 8"" players are quite a bit more. I suppose the old addage ""You get what you pay for"" prevails in this case."
3,Disposable DVD Player - Decent quality while it lasts...,"I purchased this in August 2004 for my daughter during long plane/car trips. It worked well and went through a lot of use until it recently gave out (Jan 2006). Although I don't consider that necessarily good quality, if you get a good deal and buy it from a store (such as CostCo) which has a liberal return policy you can probably end up with a decent player that will last you 1-3 years or so, even if you have to return one if it fails during the initial burn-in period."
1,lemon,I just bought this dvd player from costco and it makes alot of noise loading disc. and played only 1 out of 5 disc I tried. Sometimes it would just spin and not do anything and other times it would do nothing when I pressed play. I am returning for another. I hope o just got a bad one
3,Good Enough,"If you're looking for a good DVD player with picture-perfect quality, the Mintek 8"" Portable DVD Player is NOT for you. However, if you want an affordable DVD player that'll play your DVDs on the road, this player is good enough. The lid on the DVD compartment is loose on the left side, so you have to be careful not to accidentally open it or break it open, and the picture quality has some black specks, but if you adjust the color and brightness, it should go mostly away. In all, get it for price, don't get it for quality."
1,Screen DOA,It seems Mintek has cheap screens. I got mine day before Christmas from a Costco and returned it the day after along with 3 others I saw in the return line. All the screens were either DOA or went dead after an hour or so of video.This seems to me a common problem with this brand.
1,Product Defect,"I plugged the dvd player into my car for the first time and on a four hour trip. It lasted 1-1/2 hours and then the screen went black and it hasn't worked since. After reading all the other reviews, I think the product is defective."
3,"Not Bad, But Black Lace and Le Verdier have done much better","This was a compilation of stories about single women and wayward wives looking for sex and often times dominations in places they never dreamed of before or discovering it in the arms of a secret lover...I have read others by Le Verdier and her Seven Year List was MUCH better than this. perhapss its because I prefer a good sexy plot to a few sex-filled short stories. All in all, not a bad read but if you are making a choice, black lace has much more to offer..."
3,umm..,"i think it would work for someone else.. im pretty tight, i just wanted to be tighter.. so they didnt really do anythn.. they would barley go it.. but i think this product would work for someone whos in need of it more lol"
5,Beautiful melodies,"I've loved the movie Rigoletto for years, and one day found myself humming one of the memorable songs. I did not realize there was a CD of the soundtrack until I was trying to find the song on Youtube. The CD is wonderful, the music is uplifting, and I am so glad I found it was still available."
5,a slice of life,"I saw this movie on TV (in Australia) just recently and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's a wonderul, heartwarming story set in a retirement centre where the residents are dying of boredom. They are given a greyhound and thats when the fun starts. Veteran Austalian actor Ray Barrett is superb, especially in the court room scene at the end. Compliments must also go to James Benedict as David who gave his character a wonderful fresh performance. If you get the opportunity to see Dalkeith, do so as it will bring a tear to your eye. Good direction, good editing, good music score, 10 out of 10. Come on give it a release in the USA."
3,DeWalt - DeWTF,First set I had busted - but on that note perhaps they deserve a 4 because they replaced immediately - no cost - chalk that one up to Amazon though - NICE! I can't find the bits I used to have that cut through concrete like butter - these masonry bits are okay at best - little ones (small diameter) are always problematic though.
3,Decent Gate - Eats Batteries,"I know that kids stuff inevitably eats batteries but this thing takes the cake! It seems to eat a set of batteries in 2-3 days (we're talking 4 C batteries!) Granted, its between my living room & kitchen so it gets a workout but still going through a set of batteries in such a short period of time is ridiculous. We finally took the remote thing down and just open it manually. The only other downfall is both my children have been stuck in it at least once. Oddly spaced bars make getting limbs stuck pretty easy."
3,FAIR PRODUCT,I THOUGHT THAT THIS GATE WOULD BE GREAT BUT I HONESTLY DON'T THINK ITS ANY MORE HELPFULL THAN A REGULAR HAND OPEN GATE. I LIKE THE ONES WITH THE FOOT OPEN STYLE A LOT BETTER. I WOULD GET ONE OF THOSE AGAIN INSTEAD OF THIS GATE.
3,Does the job but there's a catch!,"This gate works just fine; however, my 2.5 year old stuck his leg through the bars during a game of hide n' go seek with the sitter and she had to call 911 to have the fire department get him out. He weighs 30 lbs."
3,Fiction based on real-life experiences ??,"Although Clay Blair, Jr., the author, is best known for his books on military history, ""The Board Room"" was Mr. Blair's first novel. Blair was chief editor of ""Saturday Evening Post"" from 1962 to 1964, and without a doubt, he drew on his real-life experiences as a basis for this book. Anyone that has ever worked in the magazine publishing industry would probably truly enjoy the book. Pick up the book and meet Lee Crawford, an editor who accepts the challenge of breathing new life into a failing magazine called The Weekly Tribune. All the time I was reading the book, I couldn't help but think ""this is probably true, how does the saying go -- the names have been changed to protect the innocent""?"
5,A very popular after dinner speaker,"`I spit on your airplane'and so began the French air traffic controllers (ATC) strike. To get aircraft to Spain, meant a huge detour because, like, France is bang in the middle between England and Spain. It was a rough few weeks and one day David has had enough and calls up and pleads with the French ATC...David: `please, please take these aircraft' ..French ATC: `Why certainly sir'David: `Great.. you finished your strike then?'French ATC: `Of course, we came back 2 weeks ago, it has been very quiet since'The French ATC had come back to work and not told anyone.This is an exceptionally funny after dinner talk by David Gunson and a CD that will be listened too many times."
3,French compilation,"Robert J. Vidal, the producer here, was an extremely knowledgeable aficionado who used to have an excellent weekly flamenco program on French radio.This is a fair collection, although not as essential as some. The track labelled Garrotín is in fact a Zapateado with Garrotín lyrics, and the Minera has Montoya's Rondeña (almost in its entirety) for the accompaniment.As the artist information in Amazon's listing is somewhat garbled, I give it in full below:01) Canalejas de Jerez (Guitar: El Chufa & Paco Espinosa)02) Guitar: Román el Granaíno03) Niño de Almadén (Guitar: Pedro Soler)04) Canalejas de Jerez (Guitar: El Chufa & Paco Espinosa)05) Guitar: Román el Granaíno06) Niño de Almadén (Guitar: Antonio Utreras)07) Canalejas de Jerez (Guitar: Román el Granaíno)08) Guitar: Román el Granaíno09) Canalejas de Jerez (Guitar: El Chufa)10) Guitar: El Chufa & Paco Espinosa11) Niño de Almadén (Guitar: Pedro Soler)12) Guitar: Román el GranaínoThe total time is 53'23""."
3,tom; carpenter,this dewalt impact drill spins faster and has more power for driving screws into concrete or steel but the batteries last only half the time as my makita 12 volt impact.so i use my makita mostly cause i dont have time to be changing batteries every 15 minutes..
2,Consider other brand,"I would only recommend this tool to someone who uses it for home. I am a contractor whom owns numerous Dewalt cordless tools and am disappointed in most. I own the 14v and the 12v impacts, and in a matter of 6 months of daily use they have both burned up arbors. The batteries will not keep a charge close to origional. B&D service centers have repaired both under warrenty, but they will not admit to any design flaw. ""Heavy Duty"", I don't think so."
1,zerospyware,"I ordered this as a download and had nothing but problems with it. First it would not install, and customer service could not help me. Then it froze up my computer until I could finally get it uninstalled. I would not recomend it to anyone!"
2,too much like the first,His first book was much better. I think he ran out of good material to write about. Some stories were even repeated within the same book.
2,Most disappointing,"I've never seen such a poorly edited book. Even the back cover contains rudimentary grammatical gaffes. It tries to be folksy and comes off as a tedious amateurish effort.The substance, pointers about travel (for which I'd bought the book), could be easily condensed to five pages.The 'humorous' anecdotes are rarely funny (though there are a couple of good laughs) and often seem unlikely to have happened in the first place.It seems as though someone had a brilliant idea: Whilst trying to rough it through airline-imposed wage cuts, write a book on air travel. The beginnings are there. Mr Steward may very well have been the right person to write this book--if Impact Publications had chosen to give him the proper guidance and correct his mediocre grammar."
5,A definite must-have for apple snail owners,"This book provides a lot of good information on the world of apple snails, covering much much more than just how to keep them in an aquarium. However, this book should not be confused for the many ""how-to"" books on various aspects of setting up aquariums. It does not give step-by-step instructions for keeping a snail. Instead, it provides detailed information on the different species and their wild habitats (and how this affects their needs when kept in aquariums) and the result is a great understanding of the ampularids as much more than just tank-cleaners. If you own an apple snail and want to what its needs are so you can keep it as healthy and happy as possible, this book is an outstanding resource."
3,Why did they call it that?,"Overall the book was quite good, however I do not know why they call it Apple Snails ""IN THE AQUARIUM"" Only one small chapter in the book is dedicated to that. If you are looking for a good book about Apple Snails this is it. However if you are looking for a book about keeping pet apple snails the info is very limited! You can find that information for free on the web."
1,Beware from where you purchase this item,"Beware of purchasing this or similar items from Amazon. I inadvertently ordered the wrong item and when I went to cancel my order less than 30 minutes later, they said I could not because it was being prepared for shipping. Still is 2 days later by the way. When I went to their return section, they said that this item could not be returned. Why does someone sell you something that cannot be returned to them?? Now I am stuck with an item that cannot be used and cost me a pretty penny to boot or of course I can sell it on Amazon myself, for less and pay the shipping. Go to the stores so you know what you are dealing with. Sure would be nice if they disclosed prior to purchasing that the item can not be returned."
4,great tool,"I am a professional mechanic and have used many cordless impact drivers. This is the best I have run across. I wish it was 14.4 volt so it would use the same batteries as drill but that is my only complaint. Plenty of power will break non impact sockets and small bolts beware. Lightweight and powerful. I will buy 18volt 1/2"" impact in future when funds allow.My recomendation BUY IT!"
5,best tool ever,"this impact is very strong ang very tough. I work as a toyota mechanic for a dealer and since we found out about the dewalt 3/8 impact everyone got one. ive used one daily for about 3 years and it still runs strong, i even bought a second one for home use. out of about 30 guys in my shop not one has had any problems, and they all got theirs from amazon."
2,"Worked for about 7 years, now dead",It worked ok for about 7 years. Now the timer dial doesn't turn anymore.Time to replace it.The worst part is the way the unit mounts to the spike.It is poor at best... barely stays on and falls off any time it's touched.I want to buy one that I will never have to replace.
2,Not for cold climates,"Purchased for engine block heater, based on Intermatic reputation, spent a lot of time working out nice permanent wiring and mounting. Unfortunately, it did not make it through the first winter; the timer simply stopped running. I'm upgrading to the commercial version T101, which cost a lot more, but they have been making this model for over 20 years, and I have never heard of one failing. It's true, you get what you pay for."
3,...,"William Faulkner is a genius when it comes to creating a plot that will always relate to society. However, I must say that although the writing style was magnificent, it was too wordy in the sense that it could almost send anyone into a world of monotony."
4,A BOOK BEFORE IT'S TIME!,"A small southern town deals with situations that are normal today.Children out of wed-lock, bi-racial children,and murder are a few issues that is forced upon these sheltered souls. I found the characters complex and enduring. The plots move back and fourth but, I was able to follow themeasily. I really liked this book. I wanted to read Faulkner but, was'nt sure where to start. I believe Light in August will make you think about the lives of these unseeming people for quite sometime. I have Faulkner back on my list ofauthors to read again."
4,Light In August,"Written about what's being felt and thought, just like most of all of Faulkner's books. My first was Sanctuary (at the age of 15) and just flew through them. Next was Absalom, Absalom!For how you get into the characters, and into yourself as you feel how they do. I see an observation of the American South which was occurring in his time, and sadly, is occurring still - aren't we learning anything here? It's cool, though, that his stories are still getting people to think and communicate. What more could any author wish for?"
4,light in august,"I tried to re-read Faulkner's novels, Light in August, was the first one followed by Absalom, Absalom and The Sound and The Fury.Faulkner's work is so well known that there is hardly anything one can add to all the critiques expressed.I find though that one has to have a lot of patience to plow thru those novels, despite the best of good will, the novels are a bit dated after all. It may well be that television and movies spoiledones attention span for Faulkner's meticulous descriptions. Or one simply has no interest in books one read for school and college. At any rate for me it was not a fruitful endeavor."
3,Boring.. Boring,"I was dissappointed in this read. I felt that the way the book was organized made it somewhat confusing. It was all around boring, and had a tough time finishing it. The author uses little detail in explaining the characters, which often left me with questions concerning the plot. Although Faulkner is a classic, I don't know if I could sit through another book like this again."
2,Wow I did not like this book,"A friend recommended this to me. I cannot belive how wrong he was about it. First off, I found it extremely annoying and confusing that there were several characters who had the same or similar names; it was kinda hard to keep track of who was who or what was going on. Second, and my main problem with the book is that I just could not relate with or even like one character in this book. I can't connect with a book if I hate every single character. Overall, this book was just dismal, although its one redeeming quality was its narratives about racism and the differences between whites and blacks. That is the only thing keeping me from giving this a one star review."
4,Character driven story telling,"This story was published in 1932 and was written for a different kind of audience than today's reader. Most people don't realize that Faulkner was a failed poet who paradoxically made his mark as a long winded writer prone to run-on sentences with poor punctuation. But, he brought his characters to life! Somehow he made you feel what his characters were feeling. And, that ability marked him as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century."
3,"Not bad, just too drawn out","I like this book and was drawn in by the characters.I did pretty good keeping up with everyone and their stories, but this book was a little long winded for me."
