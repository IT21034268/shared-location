1,Don't buy,This is a lousy recording. I would not recommend it if it were free. It sounds like it was recorded in someones basement!
3,an okay overview of her 70's output,"As another reviewer pointed out, this is a straight reissue of the vinyl edition that was released in 1979. I didn't much care for the new edits and new synthesizer overlays then, and I still don't think much of them now. If you want a concise overview of Donna's biggest 70's hits, and you don't care if the songs have been shortened, this is an okay disc to get. It also contains the long version of ""No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)"" and both versions of ""On The Radio"". These latter tracks are the real reasons to get this disc."
2,Incomplete and edited badly,"I had bought this as a greatest hits album and, while it is that, many of the songs have been edited down quite a bit. The reason? A 12 minute version of her hit with Barbara Streisand. I was bummed out as I happen to like a lot of the others almost better than this one. Do not get this one if you want the COMPLETE versions of all the songs as they were played on the radio. I'm still searching for that."

4,This PPV NEVER HAPPENED!,"The WWE will have you believe that this Pay Per View never took place. In fact, the World Heavyweight Title was vacant from March 20, 2004 when Triple H lost his smile and vacated the title live from Madison Square Garden, until Summerslam 2004 when Randy Orton defeated Triple H in the finals of a tournament to fill the World Heavyweight Title vacancy."

3,gary sherone is not pulling it off,"last 1.5 minutes of the one i want is the highlight of the entire album. please bring back sammy or dave, no offense to gary, but his voice was not meant for vh."
3,good cd grows on you,"alot of great songs,and some sound confusing. gary cherone is a wonderful singer. will be very succesful in van halen in years too come."
4,The manual that should have been in the box,"This is the book that should have been in the box with the program. It goes through database development from beginning to end, with many more examples and very good, complete instructions. A ""basic"" instruction book; not a lot of advanced ""how to's"" however (but lots more than the original manual)."
4,nice products,I have been using Nivea products for about six months or so. I started with the cleansers and they have cleansed very well without drying. I've been using the eye cream and the day cream and they moisturize my skin and smooth out the lines around the eyes. I recommend Nivea Q10 products since they have been working well for me. I have yet to try the night cream since most reviews said that it's on the greasy side.
4,Easy to store,"I purchased this product for my uncomfortable sofa bed. My guests have said it really makes the bed comfy. While it was pricer than some options, such as foam toppers, I purchased this because you can fold it up and store it on the closet shelf. It inflates easily and takes only a few minutes to deflate. I would advise a mattress pad because the product has a faint plastic smell. While other options may be cheaper, this product stores easily and works great. It was cheaper than a new sleeper sofa!"
4,Super collaboration,To think that I once had this album and sold it is a stupid move. At the time John and Al were about as cool as Frank and Dino on a great night. Well the concept here stretched out by John a good deal and Al went along for the ride. If you are a fan of Al it is well worth it. And again John orchestrated a fine piece of work. Not pure but only a fool is perfect.
3,Spilling lanes,"A warped noirish jazz-abilly journey is retained, though feels channel-changey in its more epic posturing, with warped classical elements miring the theme at the end."
5,"A fun, unusual thriller","""No good deed goes unpunished."" This about sums up the plot of Randy Wayne White's NORTH OF HAVANA, but by itself can't do justice to the story's twists and turns, its unusual characters, and its setting in Castro's decaying Cuba. ""Doc"" Ford goes to Cuba to spring his old hippy buddy Tomlinson, who (for reasons not immediately clear) sailed too near the island and had his sailboat impounded. ""Doc"" has good reasons not to go, mostly because of his previous activities in Cuba on behalf of shadowy Federal agencies, but including service as Fidel's Yanqui catcher for an exhibition baseball game (!) during which he had a serious dispute on the mound with ""El Pitcher Maximo"" which Castro - notorious for nursing grudges - is unlikely to forgive or forget. A complication is the appearance of another friend who needs his help: Dewey, a lesbian athlete on the rebound from a shattered love affair. But he and Dewey, posing as a tourist couple (and with $10,000 US stuffed in a mone"
4,"A great read, but not his best","I'm a big RWW fan and enjoyed this book as well, but as stated by an earlier reviewer, I thought ""North of Havana"" lost a little steam midway through. It may have been the fact that Tomlinson, whose eccentricities are normally a source of mild consternation for Doc Ford, are the cause of some major problems, both to Ford and to his female companion. That those character flaws lead indirectly to several deaths makes Tomlinson less quirky and more downright irritating.Otherwise, an action-focused entry in a great series of novels."
5,The next best thing to Travis McGee,"If you liked MacDonald's McGee series, you'll like Randy Wayne White. And this is the best of them. Very readable, well plotted and fun."
3,North of Havana is South of White's Best,"Randy Wayne White is an outstanding writer and his novels are usually quick reading page turners. North of Havana is a little different because it is set in Cuba and the character dynamics are different. Tomlinson seems laregly insane and Dewey Nye (who accompanies Doc to Cuba against his wishes) does not seem to fit into this story very well. For some reason North of Havana bogs down a little. It's not a bad read but didn't pull me in the way Randy's books usually do. That being said, you need to read this one in sequence with the others if you want to fully understand the story of Doc Ford's relationship with Dewey, Pilar, and his son."
1,Doc Ford is better off in Florida,"I generally enjoy reading Randy Wayne White novels, and regard him as a good writer. This, the fifth of the Doc Ford series, comes as quite a shock. It is not only boring, boring, it is utter drivel. Here White seems to have changed his style, his informative passages feel out of place and strained, as indeed is most of the book.Doc Ford is changed, Tomlinson is changed. They come over far more believable and better when in Florida, not in Cuba where this novel is set for the most part.Sanibel Flats is also a Doc Ford novel set out of Florida. I didn't enjoy that one either, but it's not drivel.I think White, in North of Havana, has attempted to elevate his writing onto a higher plain and achieved the opposite."
2,Interesting at first,I got bored halfway and lost interest. I was browsing in the library and happen to see this book. It caught my eye because it was about Cuba and I wanted to know more about the country. I wanted to visit Cuba but not now.
5,From the Publisher,"""The word 'pragmatism' is used everywhere today, from business to sports to politics. Although the word hadn't yet entered everyday language when William James published Pragmatism in 1907, the philosopher believed its doctrine had virtually become common sense in twentieth-century America. For James, pragmatism was a specific philosophical alternative to essentialism and foundationalism and argued that ideas are meaningful only insofar as they have practical consequences in concrete human experience; however today pragmatism has come to denote merely a general willingness to compromise principles, even to the point of selfishness or irresponsibility. Written in an engaging and accessible style, Pragmatism is a valuable corrective to modern uses of the word, since the voice that speaks in its pages embodies precisely the opposite values from the pejorative senses the word has acquired."""
2,A disasterous turn for American Thought,"The notion that the truth of an idea is contingent upon it's ""cash value"" has been one of the more ridiculous turns in the history of thought (thus, by James' own criteria, the idea is ""false""). The premise that human experience is all there is can lead to nothing but such an absurdity. An Aztec Gods existence was ""true"", because a belief in such a God kept one from being beheaded. There's cash value for you. Any intelligent college freshman can see right through James' loony theory, until the authority of the professor makes its impression upon them. The earth is round now and it was round when everyone believed it was flat, the ""cash value"" of the belief notwithstanding. It should have been titled ""The Convenience Theory of Belief"".Given one extra star for at least being well written sophistry."
4,Great Book at a Great Bargain,"This series of popular lectures James gave in 1909 presents a very approachable introduction to James' thoughts about pragmatism. Though I am no fan of his philosophical views, I enjoy reading James, and this, especially the first couple lectures, is an enjoyable and short discussion of his ideas. The lecture format forces him to present his views in very digestible sections. James, however, is the master of the understatement; what he says is clear enough, but you may want a secondary source to see the real implications of his views. Kudos to Dover for a great selection for their thrift series!"
4,Interesting Read,I placed a few of these ebooks on my Iphone to read during times I have had to wait around on someone or something that I was not interested in. I have to say that I am enjoying this book but I have not finished it yet.
2,Pragmatism A new name for old ways of thinking,"This series of lectures by James illustrates well the fundamental attributes of pragmatism. As such it is an important book for any philosopher to read. A pity then that that the publication is so poorly published and typeset. It is clear that this book was set using a common word processor and that the user was not even able to control the size of type from one paragraph to the next. The inclusion of capitalisations in text is very distracting and interrupts the flow of the reader, which is further made difficult by the use left aligned text as though this was little more than a typed out draft for a letter. Even common typesetting practices such as allowing sufficient linespacing are absent. Such an important historical work deserves better than the treatment given this imprint."
1,Written by an unlicensed and not trained teacher...NOT a professional,"This author has flooded Amazon and Journals with books and articles without an ounce of clinical experience. She has only taught college and has never ONCE seen a real-live patient. This book, along with the others, are so far off base and have no inclusion of important DSM IV and V criteria; differential diagnosis and solid clinical experience. yet she touts herself as an expert without ever evaluating or treating a child? Impossible to believe a word in any of her publications as she is skewed in relying on only "" her teaching a a few research articles"" vs true clinical practice. yet she pontificates from her ( retired ) teaching at a small college and criticizes true experts and feels she is some type of expert. Not even licensed.....another book written by an amature and non professional."
5,Great ASM book! Some high level language experience required,"Now this is a VERY good book. It covers all the basics and more. The disk that comes with it is sort of useful at first, but the book itself is the best for all you potential assembly freaks. Trust me on this one, you can't do with out it! I gave it a nine just because there are no perfect books."
5,Very shabby chic!!,It's an adorable pillow. I love the two totally different designs on each side. Plus the velvet trim makes it so rich. Very cute!!
3,Not Really Professional,"Somehow, this book, doesn't really warrant a Professional Tag to it, I was expecting a more exhaustive treatment of MTS particularly in improving performance. Which is very important when it comes to developing in ASP and VB COM. The author treated this area rather trivially, glancing through the topic with some minor tips that any God fearing vb programmer already knows.Rename it as Beginning VB 6 MTS programming and it will really fit my expectations as the author pretty much touched the surfaces of MTS on a very broad basis.The book will be really beneficial though for folks who's been programming in VB6 client and moving towards COM developement.Do hope that wrox can come up with a very 'PROFESSIONAL' book on ASP, VBCOM and MTS to tackle topics like program design and performance."
3,Good but you won't learn much more new things,"I have to agree that it's a good VB/MTS book but if you want to read this book, I assume that you have experience in creating VB n-tier components. If you do, well you have read other books that are most probably covering MTS anyway and that coverage should be more than enough to most people.If you need to know how to implement MTS controls inside your VB app, the VB6 Business Objects, VB6 Distributed Objects, and the VB6 databases books, all from Wrox, will give you the information that you need about MTS but will also give you a lot more information about good components creation for MTS and how to use DCOM with a good performance.In recap, a good book but you probably know what you need while getting to the MTS level"
2,Great --- ONLY if you are an advance developer,"I have only programmed in VB6. This book is NOT for a beginner. This author talks about deep under lining theory a lot and also make many examples back to C++. You have to read the book cover to cover to understand an individual chapter. If you get lost in all the theory (bunch of microprocesser stuff I never been truly exposed to and I only care to know the bare minimum.. why I program in VB), you'll be putting the book down. If you programed in C++, Pascal, & other low level languages, you will have a chance to understand this book.. It reminded me of complicated professor books back in college. I at times wanted to someone to explain to me what he was talking about... I bought this book to easily understand MTS. I felt like I needed a tutor to learn this. Basiclly most people are wanting to learn COM/DCOM in VB6 (NOT VC++) fast, and they want quick lookups on gray areas they dont understand. This book is NOT for them!"
2,very weak,"This is one of Kronos' weakest CDs. As a driving force for new music in the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st century, they've been invaluable in commissioning, performing and recording new works. But when they try to play the great music of old, they reveal themselves to be a below-average ensemble. Such is the case here with their Bartok 3, arguably the best of the composers' six quartets. Kronos' anemic sound is combined here with occasionally vague rhythm, utter lack of dynamic contrast and single-color playing, and the result is something of a joke, especially in comparison with some of the great recordings by groups such as the Emerson, Tokyo, and Takacs quartets.The other works on the disc are weak and easily forgettable (including the odd, somewhat cheesy Johnston arrangement), though the Volans is mildly entertaining. In short, don't waste your time or money on this recording."
1,white man go away,I am soooooo happy that there are sooooo many music types that can offer their opinions.I think this sight needs to prequalify submissions based upon age/occupation/salary and if anyone has ever given a sneeze about their opinion.I suppose you all reviewers would dislike the theme to Mule Train---hey it was hot in that desert---give em a break.no hair
3,Dora,"The Dora sit and spin is cute and it's very interactive for a child, they only thing that its more for smaller kids. The toy will flip if they child is to heavy so keep that in mind."
4,Dora Sit N Spin,"My two year old loves spinning and Dora, the perfect combination. The only drawback is that it cannot be used on the carpet."
2,Good read:),"[...]Very good, glad I tried it. Especially since I am not typically a fan of political fiction. Definitely will recommend."
4,"Great writer, aweful editor","I was very pleased with Mr. Grossman's yarn about a potential ""sleeper"" president. The story was well-contructed with a suitable degree of character development. The paperback version is several hundred pages and I found myself happy that it continued for that length. It is a page turner!The editting, on the other hand, was atrocious. I was disgusted by the unforgiveable number of errors, ranging from ""McGill Air Force Base"" instead of MacDill to poor printing.Overall, the writer's ability outshined the ineptitude of the editor.Mr. Grossman's talents warrant a better publishing house."
1,wasteful purchase,Only made it thru 30% of book. Left wing garbage at best. This author is on my stay away list. Bet he just loves MSNBC.
5,Frighteningly Realistic & Exciting Story,"I was immediately engrossed by this book and read it straight through without stopping - it's that exciting. The characters jump off the page with wonderful detail, so while it is plot-driven, it also is very satisfying to those who, like myself, appreciate literary novels as well as thrillers. A great read."
3,"Solid Thriller, But Flawed.","I thought this was a very interesting story. It had a plot twist that I didn't really expect.But how could ibooks allow a novel with so many spelling, grammatical and punctuation errors ever reach the shelf? There were times when it was incoherent.For example, from late in the book, an exchange between the Chief Justice and Katie Kessler. Chief Justice - ""Now you dose to question me?"" Kessler - ""To obtain your legal knowledge, sir. Does recognize the Court have any constitutional authority that prevents the Chief Justice...""What does that mean?This is a five-star story. It is unfortunate that it had a one-star editor. The people at ibooks need to take a look at the people who are supposed to be proofreading new novels. Because in this case, they dropped the ball."
2,Disappointed me and it is not worth its money!,"This book is of type, learn processing XML in C++ in 24 hours.It started out well with decent explanation of SAX and DOM (I personally feel any good c++ programmer can figure the algorithms himself). After that it completely lost track. If some one know the table of contents, he can probably search on google to find articles and bind them to make a book. xml_rpc example was directly copied from the original samples of xml_rpc implementation. For examples, the author kept on jumping from one XML parser to another one. I understand why he did that (because all existing C++ xml parsers lack some thing or other). He probably must have written chapters on XSLT, XPath, XMLRPC, SOAP in a lot of hurry to get the book done."
5,An excellent book,"Some people believe in pages, the more the better. I do not think so. With wealth of information on the Web, it is not hard to generate a thick book by cutting-and-pasting. But it requires hands-on experience, good judgement, thougthful evaluation, and careful selection to generate a book like this one. I like the concise and right-to-the point description, especially the UML diagrams, which make the points clearer.Moreoever, thick books with too many details can get out-of-date quicker because it is the details that obsolete quickly.Equipped with the basic concepts learned from this book, one can confidently surf the Web for more detailed and up-to-date informaion.I think this book worth every panny I paid."
5,A brilliant fresh view,"I teach a course on the Vietnam War and thought I knew something about the subject. The author's carefully documented analysis, making use of much of the newly-available sources from both sides (all sides) makes it clear that Westmoreland's attrition strategy was never the only choice open to him barring invasion of North Vietnam or China. Abrams effectively won the war despite a dwindling pool of resources and left it won. It was only Congress, and the radical American Left that managed to destroy South Vietnam afterward with minor help from the North Vietnamese."
5,A Better War,I was there but this book fills in many gaps in my knowledge of the war. Many things were unexplained while happening.
1,"Poor, repetitive 'history'","Better titled ""The Creighton Abrams Hagiography Project"", this book makes it's only worthwhile points in the first chapters -- 'clear and hold' is a good idea and that good intelligence information is something to aim at. Other than that, this piece of garbage jumps around from topic to topic, and has the added annoyance of reams of italicized words to give emphasis to Abrams' incessant, profane bloviating. I am second to none in my appreciation of Abrams' abilities and accomplishments, but calling this a 'history' is like calling a Big Mac haute cuisine."
1,Just Another Useless Revisionist History,"Sorley adds nothing new to the 30-year-old pile of Vietnam Warrevisionist histories. He simply trots out the standard military lineof ""we were winning, but the darned [President, politicians, media, protesters, drugs -- pick one or more] made us lose!""Claims of exploring new intellectual territory with important new sources are just sales hype. Touted of being ""unique among histories of the Vietnam War in that it focuses on the second half of the conflict"" ignores the obvious fact that one cannot analyze this part of the war in a vacuum -- the earlier years had tremendous influence on the conduct and success of later years.This book isn't even worth reading as an intellectual exercise -- as with all its revisionist predecessors, it's insulting to the complex and tortured reality of the Vietnam War."
2,Old wine in a new bottle,"Using new evidence from the Abrams papers, but failing to examine massive recent declassifications of Nixon's and others' papers and tapes, including Soviet, Chinese, and Vietnamese documents and accounts, Sorley essentially restates the mythical stab-in-the-back theory; namely, that the antiwar movement and the politicians betrayed a victorious army. Readers need to read Kimball's Nixon's Vietnam War and The Vietnam War Files; David Elliott's The Vietnamese War; Kenton Clymer's The United States and Cambodia; Luu Van Loi and Nguyen Anh Vu's Le Duc Tho-Kissinger Negotiations; and Ang Chen Guan's Ending the Vietnam War."
5,THREES COMPANY,"I had the album, but have never seen it in any store on cd. This is everything from Rush that pertains to ""Early Days"", Rush, Fly By Night and Carress Of Steel. Yes, its worth its weight in gold, and if you`ve been trying to collect most of their material, ""Archives"" is rare. Words can`t describe the ""Drive"" that Rush used to create these three albums in one. Their music is hypnotic and leaves you wondering why ""Bytor lost in the beginning, but yet became the champion in Carress Of Steel""."
4,Gut-wrenching entertainment at its best,"Excellent book. Irvine Welsh has a rather poetic way of depicting ""man's return to the jungle"".An urban version of the ""Call of the Wild"", this book is hard to read with a straight face. Sheer comedy and terror all rolled up into 393 pages of filthy yet addictive prose."
5,He'll screw with your mind.....again.,"Another excellent novel from Scotland's greatest. It ties is well with Maribou & it not dissimilar in taste. Sick, twisted characters who are so multi-faced that you're not sure whether to loathe or pity them. For a novel, the realism is scary."
3,Scary,"This book keeps your attention but I found I got tired of the unrelenting cynicism.Bruce Robertson is a complete bastard and the trouble is that he reminds me,albeit in an exagerrated form,of some people I have met in Scotland where I grew up. Worth a read,though."
3,FILTHY as a book can be,"Have you ever had worms? Do not miss a chance to learn how it feels to have some. This is how the book makes you feel. A story of a cop from Edinburgh whose hereditary proneness to violence and sexual perversity degrades him to the animal state. He upsets your stomach, gives you the creeps and makes you feel like you need a good shower. No matter what he does, there is only one word to describe it, and that word is...FILTH. It's nothing like ""Trainspotting"" or any other of Mr. Welsh's books. Your brain refuses to work and process the information. You can only feel (needless to say what kind of emotions you experience). But do not take this as a discouragement - rather a piece of advice. Get the novel and discover a different Irvine Welsh - if you can control your stomach!"
4,bitter pill,I had a curious experience reading the book - it was hella difficult to read. Scotish slang is not the point - anybody who read Irvine Welsh before got used to it. This long monologue seemed to penetrate into my own brain. I almost felt those sweaty keks on my legs. After finishing reading I got a strong relief. But a day or two after I realised that I liked it. A lot. A would go as far as to name the author Dostoyevskiy of the 90s. Only 4 stars. Trainspotting and The Acid House were 100% pure high.
4,"Not surprising, but o.k","I had just finished reading the book last night and i'm still unsure if i liked it or not. Alot of reviews here had mentioned that it was similar to Marabou Stork Nightmares..however, I feel that Marabou had much more character depth then the main character in ""Filth"" but both books are very similar and perhaps that is a let down. Overall, I feel it was an o.k book.....its not for everyone...but when has Irvine Welsh been for everyone?"
3,More of the same.,"Again, a superbly written descent into the psyche of a person I found fascinating but would rather not meet! Irvine Welsh does this sort of stuff so well, but to me it was just a rehash of Marabou Stork Nightmares, with a few tweaks here and there. I just think that the jolt I got when reading that book and Trainspotting was not reproduced here, because there is nothing here that has not been done before. Still good enough for three stars though."
2,Aptly named,Why do you need a summary when the entire book is summarized in the title. It's filth. That's all you need to know.
1,This book should not have been published,"Welsh and his publishers are abusing an initial literary success to lever their own financial gain without giving the reader any new understanding of the complexities of a tormented life. The final images of this book do not justify the ""filth"" that Welsh has collected from some very ""smutty"" sources and forced on the reader. This book is not modern liturature. It is only a rip off."
3,"Digusting, yet intriguing","This novel is a real change from Welsh's usual tales of drugged-up punks in Edinburgh...instead the main character is a drugged-up corrupt police officer looking for a promotion and easy women, in Edinburgh. A wonderful book with wild characters presented in creative ways (including the tape worm who always has something to contribute to the tale)."
4,NICE AND HORRIBLE.,"The author himself is reported as saying that 'People who think this book is terrible are missing the point - it's SUPPOSED to be terrible!', and he certainly hammers this point home, page after page, anecdote after sickening anecdote until the reader is left punch drunk and beaten into submission, convinced that the protaganist is the most loathsome, irredeemable creature ever to have been created. No other writer but Welsh could have created him. And no other writer but Welsh could have written an ending that attempts to explain what makes this guy tick and that almost, just almost, actually makes us feel what could be a shred of sympathy for him."
5,hilarious,"This is the funniest book I've read in a long time. Move over Martin Amis & Bret Easton Ellis: this is filth at its pictish best. The novel's hero, Bruce Robertson, is an endearing yet wonderfully amoral colossus who bestrides a dying Caledonian culture. Surely the novel of the millenium."
3,Get better soon,"I usually love Welsh, but this book just went beyond the pale in wallowing in scum and baseness. I hope Welsh feels better now."
3,Couldn't stop reading though at times I wish I could have,"I have never read a more disgusting book in my life and never run across a character bad on as many levels as protagonist DS Robertson. Welsh's wild and well written hyperbole carries us through some truly vile scenes to a finale which manages the nearly impossible: it humanizes Robertson by making him even more evil.It is not usually idea of entertainment to watch horrible people do horrible things. Therefore I consider this book not an entertainment but a very clever literary stunt. As a stunt, it works."
4,Highly Entertaining,"This was a real page burner for me. I opened up the novel with delightful disgust every time, wondering what sort of horribleness Bruce Robertson would be up to today. Irvine Welsh takes the idea of a despicable anti-hero to an entertaining extreme. I also find his dialogue heavy style very engaging."
3,Great start - not so great finish,"I felt the book overall was a good read, however the ending dissapointed me. Welsh does an excellent job building characters - this time from the top down with an emphasis on the down. Bruce Robertson is truly a man no one would wish as a friend. An interesting person - at arms length. Great insight into the world of policing and fraternity. The end got rather bizzare though, and left me dissapointed."
3,wonderful book. . .yet not quite up to snuff for Welsh,"If you've read Welsch's ""Marabou Stork Nightmares"", ""Filth"" may seem, well, redundant. Never-the-less, it's still a fine, first-rate novel. It's easily Welsch's most accessable work ie: the accents are easy to follow, the slang is simpler. The characterization is apt. . .you've met this cop before or, once, knew someone just like him. The protangist is stricken with a tapeworm that--sort of, or alledegly--acts as his conscience. For my money, I'd perfer the tapeworm stay safely trapped in the confines of the officers bowels, rather, than beleager the reader with it's foolish diatribes. Despite this, 'Filth' is still a great book. Just not Welsch's greatest."
4,Filth describes itself.... until you're finished with it.,"This book kept me reading, and reading, and reading. The character, Bruce continued to leave me bewildered and shocked as his attempts to advance his career as a detective. The unbelivable story that finally unfolds makes the horrific language and sex in this novel easier to tolerate.Not recommended for the faint at heart!"
1,Crushingly Boring,"This is the last Irvine Welsh book I will buy, having bought several. I finished the book so my critique would be credible. If you like shallow, unintelligent, indulgent and pointless books, this one's for you."
4,Filthy,"The entire first chapter is about a fart, I think. I had to try to read it over and over so many times because of the incomprehensible scottish slang. They replace words with rhymes, if that makes any sense. If you can get past the language, go for chapter 2."
5,MOST AWESOME LOCAL BAND YET...addison is cool too :),"Alright, in my humble opinion, the crossing is one of the greatest live bands to come out of the thurston county area. Their music is bursting with the energy of ten cheerleaders on speed. If you ever get the chance to see them live, you will understand. Inspiring lyrics and great rhythems engulf you're heart and soul. The best thing to do is to just sit back and let the music take you away."
1,yuck.,"this is a terrible cd. it sounds like a cross between third eye blind, creed, and dashboard confessional, with a bucket of suck thrown in."
3,SHIFTER 7 INCH,VIEWS DO NOT SHOW CENTER TO CENTER DIMENSION OR HOLE SIZE FOR THE TWO HOLES FOR BOLTS TO FASTEN TO SHIFTER ARM.
3,"Interesting, enjoyable, but a little flat...","We checked this book out of the library and my 4 year old daughter insists on me reading it every night. A good testimonial! The book is pleasant and easy to read with nice illustrations. It provides a good basis for a discussion of need v. want. Like the above reviewer, I too was disappointed in the overly tidy ending. Also, the illustrations appear a bit too impressionistic (for example, it is difficult to identify Alicia on several pages) which frustrates my daughter and me."
3,Startup reference for inexperienced programmers,"This book is a easy introduction to practically all basic concepts and technologies involved in Visual Basic programming for Oracle 8 back end. Among many other things it covers ADO, OO4O, PL/SQL. Contains many useful tables. It could be very useful as a startup manual for Visual Basic programmers who are new to the Oracle world. However, if you are experienced in Oracle, VB and PL/SQL, look elsewhere. Even for inexperienced programmers this book could become worthless after a week. For thorough Oracle presentation I would recommend the following books: ISBN: 007212606X ISBN: 1565923359"
5,Great starting point for VB / Oracle,Great book! I'm new to Oracle but have 2 years w/VB. Mr. Trietsch is great. He approaches the basics but works quickly into a few advanced issues. He also lets you know what he does & doesn't cover.This is a good book for the developer who doesn't have time to muttle through all of the personal stories and background information before getting to the useful information.
4,A good start,"This book is an excellent starting point if you are new to Oracle, but you will need a better Oracle reference the further you go. It lays a good OO4O foundation, touches on Oracle functions, and shows some stored procs and ADO techniques. Most WROX books are well worth the money, and this is no exception. My only beef is that they call it a ""programmer's reference"", when in fact it is more like a beginner's tutorial. Still, it is a good, helpful book."
3,Watch out for stored procedures!,"I think the book helped out on getting me started, but when it was time to use the advanced techniques (i.e. returning a recordset from a procedure), the sample codes didn't work. My advise...either stick with MS-SQL Server or use JAVA/JDBC with Oracle. VB and Oracle were never ment to be for each other. If you think that MS-SQL is not able to handle the load, you don't know it enough. I don't think Mr. Trietsch is to blame. After all, there are hardly any source for Oracle with VB."
1,just skimmed,"I just skimmed this book at a book store. It did not impress me. With most of the VB programmers using ADO, the author could have devouted less pages to OO40 and concentrated on the nitty gritty of ADO and VB. If you can read MSDN and browse the NET, you don't need the book. Especially if you have even an average understanding of programming front ends and back ends."
4,Easy and flexible,This book is well suited and easy to use. It is easy to find a word and the explanation is quite clear. The print is not too small and easy to read.
4,Couldn't Stop Reading,"After hearing and learning of this book in History 101 (Western Civilzation) I felt I had to run out and read it, and that I did, I couldn't stop reading. A great link to our history from the Silver age."
1,a polite rant,"‘Straight Forward Riding’ by Lesley Ann Taylor and Carol Brett, is the biggest [dissapointment] in a book I have ever purchased in my life. Literally. The book is nothing more than a slick and shiny and repetitious rant against methods of horsemanship that the authors disagree with, and all of the useful information included in the book could just about fit on one page..."
1,Need Complete,"I rate this a 1 not for the quality of the show or DVD, but for the need to have a complete DVD set. As with the DC Animated universe, many fans of this show will not buy the individual DVDs and will hold their money until a complete series run is released for purchase in the US. I am one.Release a complete series set and I will buy it in a heartbeat. Otherwise, Rhino, you're wasting time and money."
5,when does the complete series get released in the U.S.?,"This 25th Anniversary DVD brings back so many wonderful memories! I'd love to own more. The entire TV series is available in Europe on DVD, but when do we get it in the U.S.? Please give the U.S. fans the complete Battle of the Planets series on DVD."
4,love it but not the price,takes me back to when i was younger price is way to high but you will still love it
4,"Great box set, but why the 3 missing episodes?","It was nice to get more episodes of BOTP, but the first 6 DVDs that came out covered episodes 1 - 12, and this box set starts at episode 14, and there are a few other epidodes missing also. 3 in total. Whats up with that Rhinovideo? And where is the final episodes of The Inhumanoids on DVD?!?! Geesh!"
2,"Bad, but not bad in a humorous kind of way","This cult film is supposed to be funny because it's so bad, but unfortunately it isn't. It's just not funny, either on the bad level, or on the regular level. There are one or two legitimately good gags,like the japanese man who talks in translation, but the rest of it is just wearing attempts at any kind of humor."
4,Classic Low Standards Make This an All Time Great,"When this film was first released, it produced a reaction that was far from surprise. How can a miniscule-budgeted monster movie that chooses tomatoes as its title terror be good? Well, it isn't, really. The filmmakers knew this from the start, and simply hung onto the coattails of camp and originality. It worked. What we have here is one of the ultimate outlets for people who have a need for utter nonsense in their lives. I have seen this film at least 15 times. It sincerely has surprising potential as a favorite among just the right viewer. What starts off as a watchable mess of sight gags will become a memorable and cherishable mess of sight gags. It's great! Not for close-minded and/or boring people."
3,Just plain stupid...but worth seeing once,"This movie is dumb, just so you know. I mean, come on, a movie about ""killer tomatoes?"" I bought this moive because I use to watch the cartoon on Fox when I was in high-school. And I actually liked the cartoon. It was cheezy, but kinda cool. This movie is just cheezy. The two good things about this movies is the bragging rights of saying that you actually saw this movie, and to hear the song ""attack of the killer tomatoes."" It's an annoying song, but gets stuck in my head easy."
1,Movies you will pay for and not get,"Been looking for this movie. Ordered it over a month ago and still havent go it yet. Lots of emails back and forth, and yet still no movie. Its been over a month now."
1,Disappointing,"The film was structured for cult status and had potential but ultimately fell under its ""being bad on purpose"" direction and dragged on to long."
3,Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"I bought this movie for my husband for Christmas. This is a movie he watched when he was a kid and continues to talk about it since Attack of the Killer Tomatoes 2 appeared on our online Netflix. I had never seen the movie before and we recently watched it together. Although it had its funny parts, I found it a bit on the boring side. The age/quality made it hard for me to focus. However, he loved it as he hadn't seen it in years."
3,Stupid but like it,I knew this was a stupid movie but it is so much fun to watch. Can't seem to get the theme song out of my head.
5,An Hilariously Stupid Video,The Stupidity of this movie makes it hilarious. What is funnier than people getting attacked by tomatoes??
4,Rumers are great for this movie!,"There are MANY rumors that have been scattered around about this movie(the first one.) One of my favorites is that Roger Corman really directed this film in secret because it related so much to his super-cheap 1960 cult classic The Little Shop of Horrors.(Oh, and the truth is this was adapted from the 70's play:Attack of the Killer Tomatos.)"
3,Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"A cult classic. The situation is absolutely ridiculous, but the whole crew, from writers to actors, obviously had a ball making it. It is so campy as to be really entertaining. There are some really funny scenes and lines. Any SF/horror fan who has not seen this needs to."
3,The Original So Bad It's Good Movie...,"Oh my, my, my, my. What were these producers on? Maybe there was too much vodka mixed in with their tomato juice? Tomatoes taking over the world! What a silly idea for a movie, yet this one spawned 3 sequels AND an animated cartoon show. Who knew.Not to be taken seriously this film is funny but not in a good way. The script is awful, even by Ed Wood standards, the sets are flimsy, the special effects are nil, and the acting is horrible. Still, ITS SO BAD that the badness takes over and becomes the center point of the movie. One good note, the Killer Tomato song is fab-u-licious!"
3,Who made the salad?,"Yes, there are movies made to be bad. The producer of this film made a wholehearted and sincere effort to make this the most appalling and repugnant movie of all time. I'm not sure of the success since I can't make comparisons; I don't usually waste my time or money viewing these types of films. Here we get to see the havoc wreaked on one of California's finest cities, San Diego. It left me to think where the Padres and Chargers would play their home games and where the Marine Corps would relocate their west coast boot training facilities if the tomatoes succeeded in destroying the city. If you are entertained by these types of flicks, you won't be disappointed by this one. Did they ever make a sequel where the tomatoes attacked Camden, New Jersey to get their revenge on the Campbell Soup Company?"
4,A hoot and a half,"This is a parody lover's dream ! (Or is that a nightmare?) What a hoot! A spoof of all those idiotic ""monster flicks"" that assault the airwaves. If you take this film too seriously, you must be humor impaired! Granted some of the humor is pretty crude, but we're not talking MASTERPIECE THEATER here. If you enjoy satire, and I DO, go for it. I just wonder what Ed Wood would have done with this one ?"
2,killing me,"Bought this thinking that it was a movie that I had seen on TV when I was younger, which I thought was hilarious and was in the same category. But when I played this I realized this wasn't the movie.Yes, it has its silly moments ( one or two), but for the most part I was bored. Watched it all the way through thinking that it would get funny, but it didn't. Maybe I've watched too much Seinfeld!"
2,The Packaging Copy Is The Funniest Thing About It!,"Silly and boring a good deal of the time, there are some really, really funny bits. But you have to wade through some painful stupidity and dated cheesiness to get to them. (Hey, I'm a check-forging artichoke so what do I know.) I was taken in by the funny synopsis -- FIND THAT COPYWRITER AND FEED HIM TO THE TOMATOES!"
5,Classic camp movie,"Cheesy, yes. Silly, yes. Funny, DEFINITELY. This movie is the epitome, for its time, of all the classic horror movies made in the 70s. Where do you think the ideas for all the recent horror movie parodies came from? It could be from nowhere else than ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes."""
4,B movie cult classic,"B movie cult clasic about just what it says, an attack of killer tomatoes!!I guess ya just had to be there!!! LOL"
5,No rotten tomatoes here!,"The all-time funny cult classic is here now on DVD! ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" parodies everything from ""The Birds"" to ""Jaws"". Totally funny! You'll split your gut from laughter! Loads of laughs guaranteed! SUPER-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,A hoot and a half,"This is a parody lover's dream ! (Or is that a nightmare?) What a hoot! A spoof of all those ...""monster flicks"" that assault the airwaves. If you take this film too seriously, you must be humor impaired! Granted some of the humor is pretty crude, but we're not talking MASTERPIECE THEATER here. If you enjoy satire, and I DO, go for it. I just wonder what Ed Wood would have done with this one ?"
4,80's camp,"Just a plain funny movie. No great plot line, no great special effects, no great stars. Just the 80's camp at its finest."
4,This is a Sweet RPG,"This game is a must have for any Mac Gamer. In my opinion better than Baulders Gate one and two and better than Dungeon Siege (not quite as good as Diablo 2). This game has a rich story, good gameplay and pretty good graphic compared to other games at its time. The only downside is poor pathfinding and NPCs don't Join your party. (also im not under 13 as it says it is i just don't have a credit card so i couldnt right a real review)"
4,Fun but had glitches,"Really good RPG but it seemed to have a few frustrating glitches that were not addressed with the most current patches. The game would occassionally lock my characters in place and not allow them to travel anywhere. They could melee if bad guys were next to them, and they could cast spells and use ranged weapons as well. It got a bit hairy once in a while and made for some challenging fights. To resolve, I would have to get out of the game completely and restart the session. No reboot required.I don't know if the game would do this on older Macs - I ran it on a new iMac dual core machine.I did enjoy the game and have now moved on to Neverwinter Nights."
4,Not bad at all,"Ok remember this review is written on the old school kung fu movie scale.Basically there's a cart driver who steals money from bandits to buy his girlfriend out of prostitution. A pretty unique plot for this genre.The fighting in this movie is great, and Angela Mao, as always, is a joy to watch. Lo Lieh is the quintessential kungfu villain.Worth checking out if you're a fan of this genre."
5,MY favorite book ever!,I love Carole Mortimer and I love historical romances! This is a historical romance novel written by Carole Mortimer! Enough said!
3,Not my favorite,"I should have gotten a different Luciano CD. This one is not what I was expecting. It's okay, just not the best."
1,What ever happened to the REAL programmers reference books?,"I'm afraid I'll have to call this book a failure. I feel that if I buy a ""programmers reference"" book it should be just that. If I go to System.Web.UI.WebControls I want to see a list off all the web controls and a concise breakdown of all the parameters of each. I don't want a story about the control and a ""let's make a web page with this control"" exercise. I long for the days of my C++ BIBLE."
2,Not for starting .net,"This book tricked me into believing that all the code was going to be in c# and vb.net. The first two chapters had examples in both languages. Then, as soon as you hit Chapter 3, it drops the dual language examples. As a Java developer having to do a .net project quickly, I would NOT recommend this book. I guess I'll try again."
5,Alef Bet Blast-Off! Fixing the World Episode Two,I got this for me but the kids love it too. I am into puppets and for the kids to learn about Jewish traditions. It is an exciting video to watch.
3,Kelis is Killing Us,"Fast forward through the first 7 songs. They are pure garbage especially the Milkshake song. Overplayed and overrated. The only thing saving her from receiving 1 star is the beats from these songs.GlowMillionaireSugar Honey Iced TeaAttentionRolling through the HoodMarathonKelis does exuberate raw, nasty, trashy sex appeal much like Christina Aguilera, disappointingly her vocals aren't in the C. Aguilera range. She's nothing new or controversial--she needs to to take lessons from Grace Jones."
5,a breath of fresh air,"Since her last US release Kaleidoscope,I've been patienly waiting for her return.Tasty shows Kelis' growth as an artist and also her chemistry with other producers beside the Neptunes.The lead single ""Milkshake"" has been in radio's heavy rotation since early fall and has put her popularity at an all time high that is well deserved.With a diverse sound with producers Dallas Austin,Rockwilder and Dame Grease,Tasty ranges from an 80's inspired freestlyle sound like ""Protect My Heart"" and bouncy R&Bgrooves like the Raphael Saadiq produced ""Glow"".Also with songs ""Millionaire"" produced and featuring Andre 3000 and ""Marathon""another Raphael Saadiq production will set her apart from the rest of carbon copy female singers out.Kelis sets her own standard of song and beauty that has finally been recognized by the masses."
5,"Whoa! Kelis's third album is ""Tasty"" for real","1. Intro 10/102. Trick Me (second single) 10/103. Milkshake (first single) 9.5/104. Keep It Down 8/105. In Public 9.5/106. Flashback 10/107. Protect My Heart (third single) 10/108. Millionaire (fourth single) 10/109. Glow 9.5/1010. Sugar Honey Iced Tea 10/1011. Attention 10/1012. Rolling Through the Hood 10/1013. Stick Up 8/1014. Marathon 10/10This album really surpassed my expectations and the majority of the songs are far better than ""Milkshake""! Savvy production, awesome lyrics and creative concepts make this album a quality realese from this at times misunderstood artist. Whether you are into Dance-Pop, Urban, Alternative Rap, Hardcore Rap, Hip-Hop, & a touch of Rock, this album is most likely for you as it combines all these styles successfully! Keep them coming, Kelis!"
4,"KELIS highly under-rated, exceptional talent.","On Kelis' new album ""Tasty"", I thought it was just that. She didn't satisfy my appetite but it was a nice randition of styles, very ecclectic. I was looking for more coming from such a talented artist, I have enjoyed her work ever since ""Caught Out There"". I will say ""Attention"", ""Trick Me"", ""Stick Up"", ""Glow"" and, ""Keep It Down"", were my favorites. Definately Kelis' style and refreshing in this time of such POP music. On average her album is listenable, you can play the entire CD and not have to skip any tracks. You may just find some favorites but it's an all together good album. She's a talent of her own, more artistic and experimental then anyone out there. I think this album probably just reflects her at the time, maybe she was more in tune with herself and relaxed. Instead of searching like on her other albums. Don't hate on this beautiful talented lady, congratulate."
3,OKAY THIS ALBUM IS GD BUT NO ONE NEAR AS GD AS KALAEDISCOPE,"right... sorry, fans but this ain't up 2 my expectations. I'd have given the album 2 or 1 stars if it werent 4 da 3 gd tracks & da 2 ok tracks.4 gd trax = flashback, trick me, milkshake, glow. 2 ok trax = sugar honey iced tea & keep it down. wen i lked at in public i though itd be gd cause of nas but it was disapointing. i mean, shes SO getting in 2 sexy sassyness. wer has stuff like GD STUFF gone, kelis?worst song: either stick up or marothon or millionaire. i cant choose"
2,"somehwere BetweenJoi, Badu&Macy Gray",Kelis is catchy in spots but doesn't have the vocal chops but always seems to have that one cut that keeps Her around.She should at least be able to have a Run along the lines of Badu&Gray.but She doesn't have Joi's Edge but gets over.
5,All Hail To KELIS,"I must say that Kelis has out done herself... This is the best CD she has put out so far I think that whoever doesn't like this CD must not be a true fan. The song with Andre 3000 is THE BOMB and GLOW is my favorite track. This is CD is just wonderful and it will get the credit that it deserves you just watch and see. Where else can you get techno, funk, and hip hop. BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Kelis Bizzack!!!,"KELIS IS IS SO CREATIVE & UNIQUE. HAVING A FOUR YEAR BREAK FROM THE MUSIC SCENE,KELIS IS BACK WITH THE HOTTEST ALBUM OF 2003. HER THIRD ALBUM ""TASTY"" (SECOND IN THE STATES) HAS SHOWED THAT KELIS IS A TRUE ARTIST WITH HER OWN STYLE. THE FIRST SINGLE ""MILKSHAKE"" IS THE MOST FLIRTLY TRACK ON THE ALBUM & KNOW WONDER WHY ITS A HIT, BECAUSE THE SONG IS HOT! WORKING WITH OTHER PRODUCERS BESIDES THE NEPTUNES, KELIS SOUND HAS CHANGE A LITTLE LIKE ON TRACKS LIKE MELLO SOULFUL TRACK ""GLOW"", THE NASTY GIRL SONG ""IN PUBLIC"" WITH HER MAN NAS, & ON THE GANGSTA ROBBIN' YO ASS TRACK ""STICK UP"". I CAN'T PICK A FAVORITE TRACK BECAUSE I LOVE ALL THE SONGS. THIS ALBUM IS A MUST HAVE & ITS ALSO ANOTHER KELIS CLASSIC. I ALSO PERSONALLY THINK THAT ""TASTY"" IS BETTER THAN ""CHAPTER 2"" & ""DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE"", NOT ORGINIAL.IF YOU WANT SOMETHING THATS ORGINIAL, I SUGGEST YA'LL TO GET THIS ALBUM. YOU WILL BE VERY PLEASED."
3,Milkshake,I can only say I like Milkshake because it's the only song i've heard by kelis. I heard Milkshake yesterday in my hip hop dance class. I like the song. It's catchy and stuck in my head. Maybe I will listen to more by Kelis.
1,This CD and this singer suck beond all reason!,I wish amazon would let me give no stars to this pathetic excuss for a singer! she is a dumb skank! i guess its just to annoying song called milkshake that makes me say this. anyone who likes this big brown turd has no taste it music!
4,"Good CD, but...","I must admit, I didn't buy it. Rather, I downloaded the best tracks (from iTunes): Trick Me and Milkshake. Most people have heard Milkshake because it's all over the airwaves... and it was the album's first single, but I can only hope that the album's best song, Trick Me (an infectious dub-laden lament about a cheating man), will be released on a 12"" vinyl with a longer, DJ-friendly, lead-in (complete with instrumental and acapella versions). Actually, a Milkshake Remix in Dub might be nice B-side."
3,Leaning Towards Genius,"Kelis's ubiquitous ""Milkshake"" is either the most annoying single of the year or a stroke of genius. I'm leaning towards genius as it's surrounded by state-of-the-art hip-hop grooves on her charming Tasty. Kelis flirted with stardom when her debut Kaleidoscope came out in 1999 with its riot-grrrl inspired ""Caught Out There"". She was waylaid by a weak sophomore effort, Wanderland. It was so bad Virgin denied a U.S. release and quietly dropped her from the label. That's a classic bad decision. ""Milkshake"" is all over the charts; Tasty will most likely follow it up there. Along with Missy Elliot and the genre-busting antics of OutKast, Kelis is one of the up-and-comers keeping hip-hop so fresh, so clean. She's as comfortable with the Neptunes spare production ticks as with rockier tracks (""Keep It Down""), old school (""Protect My Heart""), and Andre 3000 in hyper ""Hey Ya"" mode (""Millionaire""). And ""In Public"", about the joys of sex in crowded places ..."
2,I was very unimpressed,"I really loved ""Kaleidoscope"" by Kelis and was expecting that ""Tasty"" would be a good follow up. I had read good reviews and finally decided to buy it.I admit that a few songs are catchy: 'Trick Me,' 'Milkshake' (of course...), and Glow. The rest of the album is nothing special, nothing crucial. Perhaps the reason I was so disappointed in this album is because I've been hearing a little bit too much from The Neptunes.Although this album possesses many of the qualities ""Kaleidoscope"" did (music, beats, etc.) I think that the lyrics aren't at the same level, I feel like it's a step down from where she was headed. JUST MY OPINION."
2,Bland Beats=boredom,If this is meant to be one of the best r'b/hip hop albums of the year then the genre is in urgent need of some help. Listening to the album there are not very many of the songs that standout. It could also be guilty of putting even the most vigilant kelis fan to sleep as all the songs have a similar beat to them. Standout songs if you could call them that would be 'attention' and 'millionaire' as well as the released singles although I doubt without andre 3000 featured this song would barely get a listen.A very dissapointing effort after loving milkshake and trick me the rest of the album doesn't live up to the standards of the singles and anyone expecting to get such kick ass songs on the rest of the album will be sadly mistaken.
2,This album is really like a milkshake...,"you know, like those superthick ones you can get at McDonalds. The album begins with promise with the intro, ""Trick Me,"" and ""Milkshake."" The album starts to be depressing when ""Keep It Down"" starts but stops briefly with ""Flashback"" (a song originally on Wanderland, a better album than this one). The album returns to its depression with ""Protect My Heart"" and never lets go. Strictly for the TRL generation and not for people seeking alternatives to commercial hip/hop and R&B."
1,Bad Taste!,"The music is as bad as the woman behind it... tacky! Horrible lyrics, music, and just over all blah! Don't recommend"
1,dislike,You know hate is such a strong word. Well I HATE this CD!! The stupid song about her milk-shake gets into your head and you cant get it out!
1,"Not another 1 track CD, tosh.","Hit the fast forward a few times, and stop at 11. Yes, 11 before stunning grooving ATTENTION. What a great track, it sort of sounds, perish the thought, some real musicians decided to get a grip of things. I love it. But the rest - its garbage really. Very disappointing. More fodder for the masses that know no better."
1,Scrumptious Beats...,"Yes, I bought this because of ""Milkshake,"" but considering the sheer amount of R&B filler out there, it was a nice surprise to find a worthwhile CD around the single. Kelis isn't your typical urban female artist lamenting the loss of her man, though her love of men is a focal point of many of her songs which ooze sex and sensuality. And a goodly number of the opposite sex, like Andre 3000 and Nas, guest or produce. Kelis does best when hitting the club beats on the album, such as the spagetti-western themed ""Trick Me"" or the vacillating rock and groove of ""Keep It Down."" Around the middle, the experience gets a little weighted down with some slower numbers, but overall ""Tasty"" is a worthwhile listen. Give it a chance...you won't want to spit it out."
2,What Happened?,"I downloaded Kelis's first album just to see if i'd like it, and i did. So i went out and bought it. Later i downloaded the second album, Wanderland, loved it so i bought that one too.So, with this reputation I just assumed Tasty would be a banger as well, especially after hearing and liking Milkshake. I went and bought it without hearing it first.It turns out Milkshake is like the only song on the whole album that i like. I don't know what happened with Kelis, but if you are going off of how her earlier CDs sounded then you might be as disappointed as me.I learned my lesson, from now on I'm downloading albums for free before i buy them.Hey, at least I got the hot pics of Kelis in Tasty, but they aren't worth $15."
5,Superb!!!!,"Guys, I don't understand all of ya! This record proves that Neptunes still can reinvent them selfs, go against all expectations and imagine the listners. Beats likes 'Trick Me', or 'Keep It Down' shows what im sayin 'bout. Beats are really variable, from minimalistic, rock influenced to totally innovative. Awesome work, best Kelis and one of the best record of '03!."
4,damn right -its better than yours,"This album is as good as Kaleidoscope imo. I haven't heard Wanderland -mainly because I don't wanna pay $28 for it- that's as much as I paid for the X-Men 4 disc box set. Anyway, the production is excellent with the Neptunes doing about half and the rest by Rockwilder, Raphael Saadiq (whose solo album gets 20 stars from me -slammin), and Andre 3000. The other reason I got this was for the track with Dre which is tight. It's worth the 1st week price at certain electronic goods stores -you know what I mean -go out & get it before it goes up. Subject matter is mostly about cuttin but it's still Fonky. I forgot to mention -Dallas Austin also produced some bomb tracks for Tasty also."
3,The All New Kelis!,"I have admired Kelis since her 1999 debut Kaleidoscope. She kicked down the door of convention, and created a unique niche. Wanderland her second effort also added dimensions to her persona, that were not present initially. Tasty is very in your face, and that is the Kelis that we have seen the last four years. However now she employs levels of explicitly that were never before present. Not to say that this change is good or bad, it is just different. If you enjoyed the preview that the first single ""Milkshake"" provided, then you will love her new album. It's going to take me a few more listens to get used to the new Kelis."
4,Almost There,"Hey. It's really good. The beats are fresh. Her voice is good. It's creative expression. What else can you ask for? When someone who has talent sings about nothing important, it usually means they're happy. And I bet she is. At least, if and when the time should come, she is fully able to sing with emotion. She has talent. So, go ahead. Get it. Most female superstars who have albums have nice beats. With Kelis, it's like everything else; PLUS talent."
3,Kelis Plays the Lil Kim/Madonna Card...,"....at issue: is it cool to have little girls mouth the words of something like Milkshake with it's bearly contained sexuality, just so's Kelis can jumpstart her career? Or is it a free speech defense? By and large the public will ultimately decide, but for me I'm getting tired of these singers with marginal talent but big, big visuals selling records. Another thing you'll hear is ""Control your kids' entertainment choices..."", ""Turn off the tee vee, the radio, turn off the CD player""--a lot of these artists are saying that knowing full and well that they're on the teevee, etc 24/7/365...I, however, most certainly will control more. If that works to get better work out there for my daughter and the other 12-17 year olds to listen to, you betcha I will. Somethings I think require maturity my daughter doesn't have yet.."
3,Tasty doesn't taste that sweet!!!,"This album is OK, just OK. I think Kelis could have done better. I love Caught Out There from Kelidescope. The rocking tracks on this album are Milkshake, of course, Trick Me, and In Public featuring Nas. The rest of this album - GOT 2 GO!!! You'd be better off buying these singles. It's rumored that Kelis bought out In Public. For sure Milkshake and Trick Me was released. I hope her next album Kelis Was Here doesn't follow this album. Bossy is a hot summer jam and I hope the album doesn't bring it down. The music on the CD sounds like it came from Mars or something. Kelis, plz do something different on your next album."
1,What Is This?,"This is just crap, bulls**t. Better lsten to Dream Theater's - Six Degress Of Inner Turbulence."
3,Tasty...not quite satisfying,"As a big fan of the whole star trak federation(n.e.r.d. clipse ..etc..) I went out and bought this cd the first day it came out..I forgot the date exactly, but it was 2 decembers ago,anyway to make a long story short,I was disappointed ''Tasty is still kind of growing on me,with the exception of ''Stick up'' my favorite track ''Keep it down'' and ''Millionaire'' this album is not her greatest effort,if you`re looking for an amazing album,listen to her first album,the classic ''Kaleidoscope'' or ''Wanderland'' if you can get your hands on it."
5,THIS IS FRESH!!,"This album is one really good cd to come from the mainstream lately, its got really good samples on the beats and her bein friends with nas is even better, shes a great singer and has good flows being a femcee and one of the best now besides Jean Grae or Missy....shes got hot beats, the whole album and Nas adds alot 2 it as well..also shes hella hot.It's pretty TaStY!"
5,21st Century Donna Summer,"Good beats. Good vibe. This album is simple in a minimalistic way yet sophisticated in its combination of compelling musical and seductive lyrical elements. It's really a shame that artists feel the need to 'clean up' their albums. Get the explicit version. This is an album that's urban, sophisticated, and a great one-on-one party album for anyone 18 or older. Should children be listening to it? I agree with the earlier reviewer - let the parents decide."
4,Baked is Better for You !,"These chips were formerly offered at Gelson's Market but are now only available online...at half the cost of retail stores :) :) :). If you want to cut-back on unnecessary calories but still like to munch on tortilla chips then Guiltless Gourmet is for you ! They are baked and not fried in oil which more than doubles the calories. I prefer the Mucho Nacho flavor but they also have Chili-Lime, Yellow Corn, Blue Corn, and other flavors."
2,Didn't realize what I was getting,Generally like the Guiltless Gourmet chips - these were too spicy though. Just didn't like the flavor - too intense. I am sure if someone wanted chips with this much spice they would probably like them better than I did.
2,Spicy Cardboard,"Bought these at Whole Foods and served them with very nice guacamole. Everyone had an odd look on his face as they chewed and chewed on these things.""Spicy cardboard"" was about the nicest thing anyone had to say. One person said they would make nice wood filler."
2,Not the McKee that is the guitar virtuoso.,"I should have listened to a track or two prior to ordering...This McKee is a bassist/ not the great guitarist I thought I was buying. If you dig jazz, this is not Brubeck but well recorded. I ejected the disc after suffering through 5 tracks!"
3,Nice maps - where there are maps,"Not a bad pocket book of maps for the world. The maps seem accurate and reasonably detailed for the price and size. Unlike most atlases, this one does not overdo the amount of textual information offered - instead there is just maps and a brief index at the back.I do have one problem - most of the state of New Mexico (USA) is missing, as is some of west Texas. The cities that would be on those maps (Albuquerque, NM for instance) are not even indexed.I'm not sure if there are any other dropouts.People talk about the world getting smaller, but I'm not sure that is what is meant."
3,Could be better from Seiko/Pulsar,I bought one for my wife and it lasted 18 months. I then bought another one and the stem bent almost immediately. This watch has much to be desired in terms of quality. Luckily it is pretty and the manufacturer iswilling to stand behind its warranty for 3 years. After that I suggest you buy something else.
1,not what expected,sorry to report that this product needs help...the buttons on the back are very inconvenient because they do not allow you to see the information on the front as you meander trying to reach the correct program...one mistake and you start all over and there are times you are attempting to receive information and before you realize it you have touched a button that has put you into a different setting. also the anometer range is only 100 feet at best while the site states 300 feet...regretfully it was returned...amazon is really great in this respect.
1,Pass on this; it's not of good quality (review updated),"UPDATED REVIEW:Unit stopped receiving signals from both the ANEMOMETER and outdoor TEMP/HUMIDITY; I would reset them and they would drop off again in a few days. As well weather radio stop functioning today. I no longer recommend this product to anyone. The unit worked OK for about 5 months then it just started flaking out. Sensors drop outs, screen glitches, and finally the weather radio just stopped working. It's obvious from all of the reviews this isn't a quality unit."
1,Don't waste your money,Don't waste your money on this piece of junk. The base station will not stay connected with the sensors even though the thermo-hygrometer sensor is less than 5 feet away. Technical support is worthless. Their support consists of asking if you have changed the batteries. They finally sent a new base unit which worked for about 5 days before losing contact. The back light on the display is too bright to have in a room where you might want to sleep. The buttons for programing and changing the display screen are on the back and very hard to use since you can't see them and the display at the same time.
4,"Nice weather station, but don't pay list price","Sensors and display work as expected. Setup is somewhat fool proof. The USB link software doesn't seem to work. There doesn't seem to be an update to fix this on the Hideki Electronics web site. Some 3rd party weatherstation seems to work better, but it looks like a hackers project. Definitely don't pay list price since the USB needs work."
3,Where to find Legal Update to Weather Capture Advance Ver 1.2,"In general - this station is OK, but no longer available via honeywell (I think) - For those of us already using it, I found a software update on Meade's Euro Website (no worries, the software supports English!)[...]"
1,honeywell tn924w,"on the site and out of the box, the product LOOKS good but when you start hooking it up you realize how bad the product operates. first thing I did not like is the manual says to wait for 6 minutes to start receiving signals from the sensors.Once the sensors finally start communicating the only sensor that is real time is the temperature. The rain and wind speed/direction is only an estimate of the last 10 minutes AT BEST, or day, week, month.second. the software did not work nor does the manual have any instruction on how to use the software. The only thing I could find on the internet about the software was a link to a site that had a third part software that costs $50 for the basic version that tells the temp on the computer or $200 for the pro version which displays all the Honeywell display readouts.DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK UNTIL HONEYWELL DOES SOMETHING TO FIX ITS PERFORMANCE OR LACK THERE OF."
1,"Oh, but no . . .","Don't waste your time with this one. It could have been a good movie, but the script got in the way. The only good thing about this flick is future ""Living Single"" star T.C. Carson (whom, you'll notice, NEVER mentions this movie)."
1,horrid,"this movie is horrid--i wonder if the acting was supposed to be this bad on purpose. and the message--that ""success"" somehow makes you white--the charicatures may have been there to make a point, and yeah it's playing like a period piece (early 90's) -- but why did baby bam (jungle brothers) have to be in this? as the narrator, ""sidekick"", he was the best thing about the flick."
2,No bubble,"I bought this item and went to hang some shelves using it.There was no bubble fluid in the center bubble making it all but useless, not too thrilled with my purchase.Richard"
5,Used by our family for 48-plus years!,"Titralac has been a household word and product in our family for almost half a century. We've tried several other antacids and, absolutely for us, none is as effective as this one! Friends we've introduced to Titralac have also been very pleased. I wish that it were better known, because it is not always stocked by the very small drug departments. Certainly good pharmacists know it and its value. Titralac is also a good source of extra calcium."
5,Kaplan is a bit too pessimistic but still Great,"Kaplan rules! This guy can write, write well and you can truely learn something from him. Just as he did in Balkan Ghosts and the Ends of the Earth...plenty of food for thought. I disagree with the picture he paints of a Cananda and possibly a US breaking up, but it still makes you think. I think he is right on the money about how the suburbs are so detached from the cities and how some communities are closer to its trading partners overseas than nearby inner cities. So in short, i don't agree with all of this book, but its a great read. Read this book and his other works."
3,Wait for the softcover.,"I picked up Kaplan's latest book in the store last night. I enjoyed both ""Balkan Ghosts"" and ""The Ends of the Earth"" tremendously and have been looking eagerly for his next book. Then I read the jacket cover. I would trust that an author would take the time to ensure that the marketing for his book would be correct. Instead I find that I will be traveling 'west' to go from Ft Leavenworth, KS to St Louis, MO. Having driven east along I-70 many times to do the same thing makes me wonder just how he accomplished this amazing feat - or is this another around the world book? Either way, I was immediately put off. This is probably foolish, but rather than put the hardcover in my personal library along with the others, I will wait for the softcover."
4,Will govt. really grow smaller?,"I liked the book. It had interesting bits of travel through America, but the main premise, that City-States and Regions will grow and the powerful Federal government will shrink does not ring true. As long as the US govt. can run up deficits, its power will remain.What was interesting about the book was considering a future where regionalism grows to the point that it begins to splinter the cohesion of the United States. This, though, remains decades away, if ever."
4,Headin' for the (gated) hills,"I revelled in Kaplan's book ""Balkan Ghosts"" and snagged this as it passed my eyes in the library. This is a difficult storyline to pursue because people are taught to think narrowly on a contextual issue. Kaplan fights this notion and is to be commended. These vignettes offer samplings of opinions that, taken as a whole, make for a worthwhile book. From my time spent in the areas of the southwest, his presentation is spot on and deserves a reading. I recommend this book as both a learning and contemplative experience."
4,Nuances of xenophobia,"Kaplan's writing is smoothly descriptive, mundane, but poignant. His thesis in this work is that America won't suffer Rome's fate. Technology, the flexible and vibrant social and political system, demographics, and merging geography will, instead, transform it. However, here's the catch: what will America become? The future is bleak and insecure for many, bright for an elite and qualified few. Will American democracy, as we know it, survive? Will the stronger, more centralized Washington-based government instituted upon the disposal of the Articles of the Confederation last?Despite Kaplan's intriguing and thought-provoking panorama of the changing American socio-economic and demographic landscape, there are somewhat strong --and at times lesser-- nuances of xenophobic, ethnocentric Anglo idealism manifested by Kaplan throughout the book. Many of the comments, if left out, would have given the book universal integrity."
3,Excessively obsessed with marginal communities,"The author offers some interesting vignettes into various Mexican and American communities. However, while relating local color and his reactions, he does the reader a disservice by focusing on the marginal, least representative communities in America. Obsessing over the Mexican-American border, he fails to follow the trail of Mexican Americans who have successfully integrated into the American dream. By interviewing only those at the margins of society, he fails to grasp the whole that is an evolving America. Perhaps, a bit more time spent in the San Fernando Valley would allow him to see how Mexicans and Jews can share a community center; time spent in Phoenix would show how a purely white city actuall worships the five black entertainers of the NBA."
4,A Book Overtaken by Events,"Events, namely one big one (9/11), have pretty much overtaken this book, copyrighted 1998, rendering most of the sociological observations academic or even dated, leaving only a travelogue, albeit a very good one. The message I got from this book is that the U.S. is morphing from a nation-state into something new and hertofore unseen -- a North American entity without borders, an entity with a smaller government concerned mostly with military, environment and protecting the less fortunate among us. Maybe that's how things looked in 1998, but 9/11 presented a paradigm shift and I suspect that Kaplan, writing the same book today, eight years later, might revise some of his observations. In any case, I like Kaplan's books. They are the thinking man's travelogues and whether here or in some third world country, his interactions with the people he encounters are stimulting, educational and fascinating."
5,Understanding America,"Kaplan has finally applied his great talents of digging into details and deriving trends to America. This book helps understand at least some parts of the soul of America, undiluted by media hype and political perspectives.His description of the decline of inner cities is moving. And the rise of gated communities is haunting.I particularly liked his description and analysis of the Mexican border and how the primary concerns there are not drugs and immigration.Above all, he writes very well. So even if I doubt some of the conclusions, the book is very interesting to read and provokes a lot of fresh perspectives. Doing this for a country that is 'over-reported' is amazing."
5,Like the title says 'Beginning' to things to come,"I currently have the 'professional wap' from the same publisher and it had a lot of information to chew on. One day I saw this book at a localbookstore and told to myself, 'let's give it a try'. Since the other book was a little too much for me to start. Boy, this book is basic to me but gets you exposed to a taste of wireless development. And like ice scream you get wanting more. In the course of 2 days I went nonstop on the book half way!!! I just couldn't put it down. After this book is done, and resuming with the professional wap book."
4,"A novel about greed, generosity and love","Anna Moore is a thirty-six year old tax inspector living in London in the year 2021. As she states at the beginning of the story her job is to measure the worth of people. Her new assignment is to investigate the world's first quadrillionaire, John Law, also known as the Cryptographer because he invented a cashless currency called Soft Gold which is protected by an inviolable code.Soon Ann meets the man and confronts him with evidence of false accounting but John Law readily accepts to repay the revenue what he owes them.From then on Anna is more and more fascinated by the man, by his great aura, by his mysterious mansion hidden behind a great wall and by his wife and two children. As Soft Gold is heading towards disaster and John Law's empire is about to crumble, Anna's feelings for him remain genuinely sincere because they are much less liable to sudden shift than the greatest fortune on earth."
2,Very disappointing!,"This book is supposed to be a suspense novel - it was nothing of the sort! It was one of the most dry books I've ever read, and I had to force myself to finish it! I could have cared less what happened to these characters - as long as SOMETHING would happen!The book I bought also was curiously absent of any Chapter dividers. At first it was just weird, but as I continued to read, it just became so monotonous that the walls of endless text with no breaks, just became a torture!If you are thinking about buying this book - I hope you are facing a life sentence in prison - because that is the only place you will find this book worth your time!"
5,Good start for developing server side java code,"After going through a series of training session and still get confused. By Java Server Programming, lots of examples demonstrate the real world case where you can apply and test out instantly."
4,Good intro to lots of topics,Definately not a reference book. But it does introduce you to lots of new ideas. Very useful in my opinion
3,"Good Book, too abroad though...",I have just bought this book and by reading the first chapters it seems to me that it's an overwhelmming amount of information. If you want to find yourself on JAVA Server Programming it will be useful but be careful not to loose the focus.
1,No focus.,"This book cover many important topics of java server developments. However, it is so much difficult to understand these topics clearly through this book!"
2,Too much problem with examples,"I had this book for a week, and I only read 1/2 of Ch 7 (Intro to JavaServer Pages) so far because of too many bugs in the examples. I won't even bother to list them here because there are just too many of them. I feel sorry for the future readers who would needlessly struggle because of poor examples. Be careful when you run the downloaded code (if you ever get it to run) because they don't match with what's in the book.It might work better with other JSP server, but you WILL run into the same problems that I had if you use Tomcat3.0.Save your money and, more importantly, **time** by not buying this book untill the bugs are fixed in the next edition."
4,good overall technology collection,"For programmers wanting to read and visualize how various server technologies can be integrated, and used in different applications this is a very good book. Its not comprehensive, and neither does it give details on a topic, but that cant be expected from one book anyway I think. Some of the examples are not well explained but there is plenty of useful information. Good resource for team leaders & system architects to get java technology features."
2,Not for serious developers.,"I would reccomend this book only to people who are new to Java Programming and want an overall treatise with something on everything possible server side. But for those who are already in this field for a while and want to build on their knowledge this book would be a big disappointment. The other main drawback of this book is its bulkiness.This book does cover some of the topics like servlets in detail good enough for a serious programmer but most of the other topics introduced are not exhaustive enough for a serious developer.To sum it up, rather buy books on individual topics and build a solid base than adorn your bookself with fancy Wrox books."
3,master of none,"Covers a great deal about Java beyond core. however, tackles so much, it is not detailed or comprehensive enough in any given area to understand deeply let alone apply confidently. Lacks explanation of fundamental structures. Chaps read like a novel, without giving sufficient solid underpinnings of principle.in my opinion, it is good as a broad survey of the components and applications of the java language, with excellent real-world examples.also, tone and quality of chaps is inconsistent given the many authors.If you are advanced enough to understand and breezed through this book, then you don't need it.If you are just learning what this book is attempting to teach, then my advice is to find more specialized books."
2,Ok as an overview but too bulky,"I guess I shouldn't expect a book written by 12 different people to be too cohesive but this book was very disjointed. They tried to cover too many topics with varying levels of depth so while this may have been a good book were it intended to be an overview of the technologies, it ends up uneven with topic coverage quality ranging from average to poor. The case studies and plethora of appendixes mostly bulked up the book rather than adding value."
2,Jack of all ... master of none,The authors have tried to cover most of Java enterprisetechnologies in a single book . Couldnt do justice to any of them.JSP coverage is minimal and inadequate . Professional programmers mustlook for books specialising on this topics: I am listing some of them here.*Java Servlet programming By Jason Hunter*Enterprise Java beans By Richard Monson-Haefel*Java XML programming - Wrox press*Professional Javaserver pages - wrox press...There are umpteen good books on XML/XSL basics . Please do not waste your money on this title.
1,From programmers to publishers,"To achieve ""time-to-market"" get as many programmers as possible to digest everything Java server related, request authors to include lots of code and sell the book as advanced and timely. Include APIs to make it look big. And here you have it: a waste of time and resources."
2,Poorly organized with examples that don't work,"This is one of the worst books I have purchased on the subject - definitely not up to WROX's usual standards. I have yet to find an example that works mostly due to poor documentation on how their development environment was setup. The ideas presented would be great if better developed, but most (incl. XML programming) are too cryptic or limited in scope to be of much real world use. It's loaded with buzz words but not much meat."
2,Not for serious developers,"I would reccomend this book only to people who are new to Java Programming and want an overall treatise with something on everything possible server side. But for those who are already in this field for a while and want to build on their knowledge this book would be a big disappointment. The other main drawback of this book is its bulkiness.This book does cover some of the topics like servlets in detail good enough for a serious programmer but most of the other topics introduced are not exhaustive enough for a serious developer.To sum it up, rather buy books on individual topics and build a solid base than adorn your bookself with fancy Wrox books."
2,Only recommendable for the Servlets part,"The chapters by Andrew Patzer about Servlets are well written and informative, so the book starts promising. However the quality of the rest of the book rates between reasonably good, mediocre and very bad. I my opinion the worst of all is the the chapter on smart servlets, where I wonder if the authors really know about what they are talking. The appendices on the various APIs are close to useless. That the book is badly designed with horrible typography does not really contribute to a good impression."
3,Spare your money for something better,The authors made the mistake to cover all Java Server side technologies in a single book . They couldnt do Justice to any of them. Lot of space is wasted to cover API listings which is very much available with the Enterprise Javadocs. The coverage of JSP is really poor.
3,Unfortunately Outdated,"Although, this book was a great reference about a year ago, I am shocked it's still selling and that it has retained its selling price of ~ $50. Do yourself and WROX a favor, get an updated J2EE book which will greatly improve your ability to successfully navigate the server-side world of Java, and send WROX a message to start selling books which are no older than 6 -9 mos old."
5,Excellent Resource,"For server-side Java,this is a fabulous book. Well written, consistent and full of code examples. The best part is the references to good practices and implementation, so it really isnt an academic book, but more of a real-world book."
1,"a complete mess, or ""a mess-complete{","This was a great idea for a book, but wow, could really have used a few writers and an editor on this project. It's so badly organized, badly written, badly punctuated, and so full of typos, that it's really hard to understand. Chapter 23 on EJB's will really make your head spin.WROX books are written by programmers and you really see the the down side of that approach here.If you want to understand Java2 Server Side programming, buy something else."
4,"Excellent, comprehensive resource","As a professional server-side developer, I found this book to be well written in almost all parts, and very thorough. It's difficult to provide so much information in a book covering so many topics, but this one does a great job. I recently gave a poor rating to another wide scoop book (Red Hat Linux The Complete Reference) because it lacked any details at all. If you are serious about learing the various topics, this is a great place to start."
3,Thin towel.,"This is a cute towel, I purchased it for my cousin since she had it on her baby registry. It's very thin though, and not very good quality for the price."
5,Wonderful book!,"This is a beautiful, heart-breaking, heart-warming book. A don't miss for memoir, fine fiction, and just plain entrancing reading. Don't let this one slip through your fingers... buy two and pass one on."
1,Great Looks.. Terrible Execution,"Great looks on this coffee pot with interesting angles and clean-lined stainless not common to this price range. However, carafe is major downfall. The thin walled carafe will not shatter like similar glass designs, but is uncomfortable and drippy while pouring. Also, the poorly constructed handle is attached with screws and cheap plastic. Consequently, the handle separated from my carafe within 40 uses. Strongly not recommended"
2,Clumsy,"This coffee maker does not have an automatic shut off mechanism, it only shuts off after 2 hours if you program it to come on automatically. (Very inconvenient). Carafe is difficult to remove from machine when you want to pour a cup of coffee. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"
3,Russel Hobbs coffee maker,"Good coffee maker for the price, although getting the coffee in the filter is a little difficult."
1,yuk,TERRIBLE! this really is a bad machine..i highly advise not buying..mine was broken right out of the box!
2,Huge disappointment,"I bought 3 of of these at the same time. One lasted but 1 day. Just died. The other 2 are still working but don't get the water very hot. It is also very difficult to see whether the on/off light is lit. Water also pours out of the back if you put the water in too fast or over fill it, making quite a mess. Defintiely not even worth the $9.95 + shipping sale price. ""Sounds too good to be true . . ."""
1,What a mess!,"A good example of ""if the (sale) price looks too good to be true, it probably is."" What a disappointment. Due to a hard-to-believe engineering oversight, there is insufficient clearance between the pause-and-serve valve and the carafe's lid. The valve, therefore, does not open enough to allow the coffee to exit the basket. Our first use resulted in quite a mess. Subsequent use has therefore required a shim-like device (plastic spoon, craft stick, etc.) to be inserted between the lid and the valve. Recommendation: spend a little more. Buy another coffeemaker."
4,Just right size,"Although the ad says 8-cup coffeemaker, this is a misnomer to those of us who like a big mug. It makes 2 good-sized mugs of coffee for me. Since that is all that I usually allow myself per day, it's just right for my one-person coffee drinker family.I am not totally satisfied with how the basket swings away (hard to describe). It is awkward to fit that and the pot one on top of the other."
1,Russell Hobbs coffeemaker,Very difficult to pour coffee from this pot. It spills into everything but the cup. I have already replacded this item.
4,convenient coffee maker,"It is a very good machine. It can help me to make coffee in a few minutes, also, it can boil water for other kind of hot drinkings. I enjoy the convenience it brings me."
4,It does what it's supposed to,"Does it look and feel cheap? Yes! Does it do exactly what I expect it to? (Make coffee automatically at a pre-programmed time in the morning) Yes! I've used it to make coffee before I wake up every morning for almost a month, though the design of the pot itself is pretty bad (I kinda expect it to break or otherwise fail sooner or later) it's done the job so far and I can't complain."
1,Very disapointed,"I bought this as it was just a little bit bigger than my preent coffee maker..I could get 3 mugs of coffee out of it.., rather than 2...However, I used it exactly 5 days, and then it died...Granted, the econonical price was a factor when I purchased it, but I really expected it to last more than 5 days..Unfortunately, it would have cost me more than it was worth to have it fixed, so I was forced to throw it away...Lesson learned; some things are just not a bargain..!!!"
2,jim,"The service was fantastic the cologne is horrible, and I must have close to 50 types, I wasted my money on this one"
1,bad,"i think the rive Gauche is not the Genuine item, the bottle was made by metal, but perfume can not be used metal bottle to hold,because metal bottle has metallic taste which will influence the perfume. there are not YvesSaintLauret label on the base of bottle."
5,Smells great and lasts 48 HOURS!,"This smells really manly, and projects well. It becomes a talcum+barbasol scent in an hour, but it lasts over 48 hours. I spray people with this after I give them a haircut (it smells like the perfect barbershop scent).I give any prospective cologne a little test. I call it the Gender Bender.I ask myself ""Could this be a female scent?""This passed the Gender Bender with flying colors. This will NEVER be mistaken for a female's perfume. It smells really clean and fresh, but warm at the same time. It is best described as a barbershop scent. It smells like you just got a haircut and straight razor shave at a top-notch barber.If you're one of those guys who wants to smell clean, manly and not like those robots wearing Acqua di Gio, get this bad boy."
3,Too small a sport case,"While the PocketPC Sport Case is great for the unit by itself, it will not hold the PocketPC with even a CF expansion pack. The enclosed plastic grip (which holds the PocketPc) is structured for just one thing, the PocketPC by itself. If you use any expansion packs on a regular basis, this is not the case for you."
3,"Good case for the ipaq, but not very roomy...","I was hoping when I got this sports case that the case would fit both the iPAQ and the Compact Flash Jacket, however, the interior clip is designed to accomodate the iPAQ ONLY.Pros: The clip is designed so that you can use the iPAQ while it is still secured in the case, and the clip really does hold it quite securely. The case also feels quite nice in your hand.Cons:The interior clip holds the iPAQ so securely that it is somewhat difficult to install and remove it from the case. The zipper also gets in the way of removing the stylus- you may want to store it in the pocket instead of in the iPAQ. And, of course, you can only put the iPAQ in the case- I wouldn't count on putting anything else in unless it is VERY thin."
1,A well made case but not what I expected,"This case holds the iPaq very well with no velcro - but that's all - no expansion sleeve. And it's not easy to take the machine in and out of the case. If you want something to protect the device and are willing to open the case as you would a book - this will work for you. I couldn't attach the USB sync cable although there is a hole for it. The IR port is exposed if you use that (I do for some printing). Frankly, I prefer a clip on holster type carrier and this case cannot do that."
2,"OK, but is a little small","Got the case about 2 weeks ago, and was surprised with just how small it was. not too much bigger than the actual iPAQ. Does have a really cool clip inside that holds youe 'naked' iPAQ without needing any velcro, but there is not much room for anything else. I have the CF sleeve, CF modem, CF ethernet card, and multiple memory cards, but there is not any room for but 1 or 2 of the CF memory cards in the case."
2,Lacks alot.,"This case is way too small for anything. It will only hold your 'naked' iPAQ, and maybe a credit card or two. Is useless if you have any expansion packs. Would not buy again, but if I had to, I would go straight to Compaq, and get it for less."
1,Bad designed and poor quality,"When I got the case I thought it was a poor design that the snap would repeatedly drag over the top of the IR port. Then one day while putting the Ipaq in, the clip just broke off entirely! An extremely disappointing product."
2,filled with other agendas,"I was extremely disappointed. For a book on simplicity it was complicated and filled with social, political and environmental agendas. If I did all he recommended, life would be extremely complicated. Simplicity has to be livable."
3,Some good tips and some poo,"Buy Adam Hamilton's ""Enough"" instead of this book. I like the practical tips but I'm not convinced of the philosophy."
1,The pages were brown with age!,The book itself is fine...interesting thoughts by the author but the paperback is ancient and the book was brown with age. I cannot remember who the shipper was but hope to never run across them again!
1,Junk,"Are you kidding I know it's only a few bucks but the extreamly poor quality is beyond what I would call cheap! Tried to mount the damn thing with the screws they provided -- Ha, all 4 snapped in half when trying to screw them in, I even drilled pilot holes. Honestly I am getting really tired of the ""Made in China"" thing. Can't these companies spend a penny per 10,000 screws and get something a little better than diecast.I give this company a -1 on a whole for quality!!! I will never buy another one of their products. I could do a better job with tinfoil and duct tape."
2,"Cheap up front, expensive in the long run","Works good, replacement bulbs are expensive, the ballast on the first one lasted about two years, this was a replacement purchase."
5,A Kabbalistic blessing in English,"While Vol.1 only contains ""Haqdamat Sefer Ha-Zohar"", the ""Be-Reshit"" and ""Noah"" parashot, the footnotes and references alone make this an incredible work for English readers. If Aramaic is not in your ""to do list"" of languages, then be sure to get the Pritzker editions and compare them with the English Soncino version.The paper quality, printing, and binding are all top notch.So other than cramming more content into each volume, there isn't a single thing to gripe about."
3,"The Zohar, not for beginners","I bought this book trying to learn more about the Kabalah. The book is nice on its hard cover, but it is a little hard to understand; specially for a newby like me. I would say that in order to understand the Kabalah's theories is better to look for a teacher o a book not so advanced."
3,The Mountain,"You should know that you have come to a good place. You are standing on a plateau, on a high mountain and you have three, no, but four paths that can lead you out of here.1. The first is the easiest one: go with the Kabbalah Center translation.2. The second is not that simple: go with this translation.3. The third is hard: go with the original Hebrew text.The first path can take you where you do not want to be. The second one will take you through deep woods. In the end, you will arrive at the beginning of the third path. The third one will take you higher and higher and higher.The fourth path is taking you back from where you came. There are other peaks to hike. You can come back to this one later."
3,Valuable Lesson in Racism!!,"Recommended by a friend, I purchased this completely blind, and without a hint of what it contained. I'm not going to reveal the storyline, but I would measure this against ""Crash"" for a well-depicted lesson in what goes around - comes around! I would rate this higher, but because I get a lot of ""flack"" from those who watch it, I'm hesitant to rate it as a good theatrical piece, but more or an ""end of the day"" success, direct from Triple K Marine."
4,THE CORNDOG MAN RULES,"IF THE CORNDOG MAN COMES CALLING, INSANITY IS SURE TO FOLLOW. THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE WHICH SEEMS FUNNY AT FIRST AND THEN BECOMES A GRIPPING TALE OF REVENGE ALA CORNDOG SERVED UP WITH A SIMPLE DEVICE KNOWN AS THE TELEPHONE."
5,"Great, Great movie","I took a chance on this a while back in Blockbuster. It is awesome. I love it. I rarely watch a movie twice, much less buy movies, but I just had to have a copy of this so I could watch it time again and show it to all my friends when I start talking about it. I love it!"
5,corndog man,I have order this twice once I loaned it out and it didn't come back I have to have a copy to show people and surprise them with how great it is.
1,the sent of where?,I have just read (Kaplin 2007: 465- Fijian Water in Fiji And New York: Local Politics and a Global Community) that this product contains absolutely no ingredients originating in Fiji.
5,Fidji Eau de Toilette and Perfume,"My wife has been using Fidji since the 1970's and still prefers it to any perfume available. Not many stores carry it now, but it is still available online at a number of sites. The prices have gone up recently, probably because of the weakness of the dollar against the euro."
2,"Very complete, but copies from other titles","This is a great book to keep as a reference. It covers all of J2EE, and has some interesting ideas on application design. However, if you already have a lot of Wrox ""professional"" titles, such as ""Professional JSP"" or ""Professional XML"", stay away. This book just repeats excerpts from those, and is more confusing because it doesn't contain all the information. For example, the section on XML namespaces was a hodgepodge editing job on the section from the XML book, and confused me even though I already had a basic understanding of the topic.But, its worth a look if you don't have any of the other contained content."
3,The illusion of completeness,"Did you ever look at something that seems perfect but scratch the surface and there is nothing there? This is one of those things. Every time I look for a topic, it is there. When I go to read it, there is just enough there to inform me that it exists an no more. No matter what you are looking to do, you will need another book with you so you will understand the topic.It seems that Worx thought that by focusing on examples, they could cover the topics better. This backfires on them. The book spends so much time on examples that the topic is not covered. Also, the examples are of limited value and often just a rehash of examples that have been floating around for years.If you need a broad stroke to cover all the topics, this is a good one. If you actually need to write code and need something that will help you to understand a subject, get something else!"
3,Average Book!,"I would give an ""average"" rating to this book. Actually, it covers little of many topics that there is no comprehensive coverage of any. it may be useful for readers who are already familiar to an extent with the J2EE concepts, but for a novice I would definitely not recommend this book. Instead, you could buy separate books for individual J2EE topics that will help you gain an indepth knowledge in each of those!"
5,Professional Java Server Programming J2EE Edition,"Although I just started reading this book yesterday, felt it was written to the technical point, clean and precise. It covers all the major topics of J2EE in all dimensions, in terms of architectural view and implementation methodology. It is a very helpful and educational reference for people who works in every areas of J2EE, yet with a need to link and leverage all in a whole and in depth understanding of the J2EE technology.I will write to you again when I finish my reading.This book is dated in 2000, will the authors be writting a updated version which covers update-to-date J2EE, such as EJB2.0??"
2,Very good book if you know every thing already,"It is a very good book if you know how to work with JSP and J2EE. If you know every thing, the examples are too simple. If you do not know very much, it is hard to make the examples work. It is not a reference book for sure. I did not like this book when the first time I use it. After I read other books and read this book again, I found it is a good book except the examples are too simple."
2,Save yourself time and money....look elsewhere,"While I applaud the attempt to cover all these technologies in a single text, this book does not work. It seems as though the authors bask in their own intelligence, making already complex subjects more difficult. I highly recommend reading the Sun website tutorials, they are much easier to understand and do a MUCH better job of getting the essential subject matter to the reader."
4,This is an into book,"This is a ""intro"" book from several authors. If you don't know the j2ee technology at all or you intend to know any part of the j2ee then this is a good start point. But if you liked to dig into a specific area or to develop an j2ee application then this book is not sufficient.Moreover this j2ee book is a bit obsolate, the 1.3 edition is a better choice though the j2ee tech goes to the 1.4 edition."
5,came on time and what my mom wanted.,my 93 year old mom thinks this author is one of the best story tellers of her life.thank goodness I can keep mom happy.
4,Even the cover art is great!,"If you like music, you'll like this? I find it hard to review CDs as musical taste is so subjective. But I do enjoy this album!"
5,Best Crochet Book Ever,"As you can see from the reviews of this book, MODULAR CROCHET is the best crochet book I ever bought (and believe me, I have quite a few in my collection). Not only are the instructions easy to follow, but the clothing you create from this technique has the look and feel of knitted garments.Once you understand the basics, the only limit is your imagination. And while the book was published back in the 1970s, the styles it contains will always be up-to-date. The price of this out-of-print book has sky-rocketed, so I am grateful to have been able to purchase it when it first came out. Definitely a keeper!"
3,Good book but examples are not always working,"This book is very readable and very well suited for beginning asp.net programmers. It makes you feel at ease with asp.net. Too bad the examples don't always work. For instance, the final chapter 12 makes you write an application with all the stuff you've learned in the previous chapters. The code that is provided, doesn't work at all. I get error after error and that's a shame because I really want to see the information being used in a real world example."
3,not bad for basic but shame about the last 2 chapters,"on the whole this is a very good book for beginnersThe last two chapters which i thought were themost useful was RUSHED!!The performance chapter should not have been a chaptersince it was non-existentThe most important chapter of all the bidding web siteconstruction, I failed to get it to work!! one errorafter the other. For a book with so many authors, Iwould have thought at least one of the would have had thetime to review the code for the last chapter.I give this book a 3 but it deserves a 4.Unless the code in the last chapter works, the last chaptermight as well not be there either"
5,One of the most engaging piece of music,"I first heard Bulgarian vocals on Kate Bush's ""The Sensual World."" The Trio Bulgarka provided melodic augmentation on 3 tracks (""Rocket's Tail"" fully exploited the Trio's vocal capabilities). That was in '88--pre internet and had tried to find recordings by the Trio. A couple of years ago, I came across this CD and recognized members of the Trio Bulgarka in the credits. I listened to this recording over and over and found it to be haunting, poetic and satisfying (except, of course the length of the recording--at 20+ min. it's really short). The most engaging tracks being Kalimakou Denkou (a funeral lament) and Polegnala e Todora (a love song) bring on a sort of happy melancholy that can, at once, put a smile on your face and a bring a tear to your eye."
5,Outstanding quality,"Both the choir and the compositions / arrangements are of an unchallenged quality. The music is unique in itself, and the performance is fantastic."
3,Laminated pamphlet,"This map is all right, but it is small. It is not much more than a laminted pamphlet. I have been to St. Petersburg twice without the map. I suppose the map might be nice to carry around, but its small size also limits the amount of information it gives. I guess I was expecting a little more."
2,"Unreliable, sloppily edited book","This book is seductive. It provides hundreds of slang terms that you won't see in more traditional vocabulary books. However, the book is so poorly edited, rife with so many errors that go beyond typos, that you can't trust a translation to be accurate. For example, in the phrase ""ne pas reculer d'une semelle,"" the french is in the present tense but its English translation is in the past tense. Conversely with the phrase ""ne plus manquer que a,""where the french is in the imperfect tense but the English is in the present tense. In the phrase ""tre le portrait tout craché de quelqu'un,"" the french example has ""tu"" as the subject but the English translation has ""he"". ""Requinquiner"" should be ""requinquer"". One could go on and on.If there is a second edition (and I certainly hope there is, because the slang used is useful to know), the copy editing must be more stringent."
4,very helpful,"This book is very useful. Stays away from the high school french they (the french) never use anymore. New enough and will hopefully stay true for a while. but you know the french, the language will change next week. : )"
5,Burke's Street French Always Good,"Although I'm still working on my French fluency, Burke's Street French is still a good buy.Ed McCabe"
2,"some mistakes, but otherwise pretty good","There are some great aspects about this book, but also quite a few that take away from them. First of all, there are some things which are errononous -- ie: just about all of the Accessibility coverage (quite an important new feature) -- some of the things it tells you to do won't work. That piece of code is for something entirely different, not checking accessibility. Secondly, some of what is said about video is not correct as well. Finally - some of the tutorials are not completed -- it says they will be in a ""later chapter"" - but this doesn't seem to occur. Perhaps this book was rushed out (the typos and grammatical errors might explain this - why the review goes from a ""3"" to a ""2""). Anyway, apart from that some valuable points and lessons in this one."
3,"So, so book.","It must be difficult writing one of the first MX books, so considering that. this book is ok. It has no real depth on any one subject and feel like thirty percent of the book is repeat Flash 5 content. Too much time is spent on the free transform tool.Good coverage of components. Not a bad buy for the price. However this author has done better work."
2,Far less than I expected,"I was disappointed in this book. Although the Friends of Ed books have had a good reputation, I find that this book seems to cater to the ""in crowd"" who already knows Flash. There are far better books available, and this is not one I'd recommend."
2,Very personal...a drum concerto indeed,"There is nothing very virtuosic or accessible about the percussion here. It's nothing like the drum playing coming from any number of great jazz and rock drummers nowadays. It's more of a personal free-form performance of drums and sometimes hilarious (""Think!"") vocal utterances that might be more at home in the 1960s. And that's okay, but not really my thing."
4,pleased,resieved my order promt and i was very pleased with the product asweel as value. same item would of cost me 20.00 more with less thread count. i recomend this item
1,More useless crap,"Like almost all solar lighting products on the market, this one fails miserably, and becomes landfill within a month. Worse, to change batteries (and replace the cheap, useless one that it comes with, you must disassemble the product. This did no good in my case, as even after replacing with a fresh battery, it failed to light. The reason, in my estimation, is that the circuitry, the ""guts"" of the light are not water tight. A little rain, a little sprinkler, a little heavy dew, and everything inside is wet. Not a good environment for electronics. Looked lovely for almost three weeks, then it died, never to run again. Save your money and the environment, do not buy these.;"
1,"A lovely lantern, that just fails to light",We put two of these lovely looking lanterns together and are still waiting for the lights to at least flicker a tiny little bit. Fireflies in the backyard give off more light. There's hope - we still have one unopened package.
3,Good book but not for beginner,"Good book, but goes more detail intotools provided by Oracle. If you will be usingonly oracle tools, this is a good book."
1,Test exam not up to standard.,"I bought a copy of the Osborne CCNA test software with the view that a high result would mean that I was ready to sit the real thing (CCNA 640-607). No, I failed. So I picked up a copy of Cisco's ICRC (student manual), rebooked the exam and passed no more than two weeks later. These are my reasons why I didn't like the test software.1) The questions weren't hard enough. 2) The questions that were in the test software didn't even relate to the Cisco CCNA exam. 3) And finally, the Prometic's CCNA exam is not presented in HTML format."
2,Awkward,"I am not in the habit of writing bad reviews, but I found this book awkward to use. It is too large, and did not focus on the exam. It contained errors (but that is a common complaint about books in this category). I was disappointed that they did not include a flashcard version on CD. I recommend you NOT buy this book. Spend the money instead on an exam review book and one of the fine ""practice test"" products available for the CCNA. (I can recommend Boson.)"
1,"Example Questions Aren't ""Straight from the CCNA Exam""","I took and passed the CCNA exam, no thanks to this product. The questions on the actual exam were more difficult than the questions presented on this CD-ROM. Of the 78 questions on the actual exam, 4 to 5 appeared remotely similar to the sample questions. In addition, not all the answers to the sample questions are correct. Some of the mistakes are obvious (CD claims an ISDN PRI is 23 D channels and 1 B) but some aren't so obvious. I didn't get this CD to proof it for the publisher, and I don't think you want to either."
1,significant errors and answer links,"While this sounds like a great deal, with an abundance of questions, there are wrong answers. Add to this the fact that detailed answers are not linked correctly in HTML with different font size and styles, and you have a poorly designed product for the price. Osborne should have spent more time designing this product. Be wary. I recommend Lammle's books if you are serious about accuracy."
5,The best short story writer I've yet read,"Short stories are my gig, and upon finding Thom Jones (Cold Snap & The Pugilist at Rest), I'll simply say -- in case you care, because if you didn't, you certainly wouldn't be reading reader reviews, now would you? -- that Mr. Jones is the very zenith of the art. Yes, his stories are tense, dark, foreboding, gritty -- and real and often very funny. The dark humor found in Thom Jones' writing mirrors that of this so-called ""real life,"" complete with subtle affronts to the laughable state of humanity, the shells of men and the chemical escapism that entices many of them into subscription, and characters real enough to make you think twice about with whom you allow yourself to be surrounded. All in all, a fantastic, stunning compilation. Read it. Twice. You won't regret it."
2,Unbalanced Collection of Stories,"This collection of stories offers nothing new in the landscape of contemporary fiction. There is nothing unique in the prose, just the raw stuff you'd find in Tim O'Brien or Ellen Gilchrist. The title story is the only one I liked. I especially hated the one told from the perspective of an Australian, it detracts from the main themes too much. There are better choices, like Rick Moody or Annie Proulx."
4,Different Trains,"This was my first time listening to minimalism and this is incredible. ""Different Trains"" is very well written."
2,It Just Misses for Me,"I would like to love this CD. I have always admired Reich. And the concept is powerful. The Kronos quartet pairs with prerecorded sounds of steam engines to compare the composer's early love of trains with the trains in Europe taking Jews to the gas chamber. Powerful idea. But for me, minimalism just doesn't have the dramatic oomph to deal with the subject matter and so the piece feels like an ""idea"" rather than an emotional response to the holocaust. The second work on the disc, Electric Counterpoint, also seems to be treading water. The material doesn't feel much different from Reich's more ground breaking work of the early 60s and 70s.All and all, for me this is a disappointing recording."
3,"there are only so many ways to ""think out of the box""","This is yet another book that is designed to get the reader to think in new ways. So far as it goes, this is a useful message, but I must say that - in spite of the veneer that cognitive neuroscience offered by the authors - there is nothing very original in this book. It does have exercises to think beyond one's standard views and some advice on advancing revolutionary ideas into an organization, but I feel that the reader can find these types of suggestions in innumerable other books already available. THe only difference is the vocabulary employed here (""impossible thinking"" rather than ""paradigm shifting"" or ""thinking out of the box"" or ""tapping creative blah blah"") and, of course, the way it is written (which isn't bad).As such, I can only tepidly recommend this book. Moreover, at the risk of sounding arrogant, I am used to thinking out of the box already and so did not need any of this."
2,Impossible to Read. Very Dissapointing,"With such a promising title, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately, this book misses on all points. The philospohical angle is flawed from the start and the ideas put forward were long ago proven to be wrong. This book definately did NOT transform the business of my life or the life of my business."
2,"Misleading title, basically a book on everyday common sense.","I was excited about the title, in knowing what the author means by ""Impossible Thinking.""This book probably could have been compressed into a pamplet with contents from the first and last couple of chapters. The idea of Mental Models are thought provoking. The technique of Zooming In and Out are useful. The ending Nueroscience chapter is full of information. But then you have about 80% of the book in the middle that are just full of generalizations and very basic common sense thinking. It's hardly ""Impossible"" thinking, and nothing ground breaking.Instead of this reading, I would much recommend any self help book, or any book under ""creativity"" (""Cracking Creativity"" by Michael Michalko is a good one) would be more insightfull.Very dissappointing book, especially with such a seemingly dramatic title. Just full of generalizations and repeatedly asks the reader basic common sense questions."
1,The Power of Impossible Thinking,Was sent the wrong book. I will need to contact A&B Media Service which doesn't include a phone # and try to get the right one.
3,Read this book if you are an arrogant perfectionist!,"This book is the handbook for arrogant perfectionists. It advocates the idea that anything that isn't ""impossible"" or ""the best"", isn't good enough. There aren't a lot of ""bests"" in the world, and as is the case in most situations there isn't necessarily a ""best"".I think improvement needs to be done in baby steps. You crawl, then you walk, then you run, and so on and so forth. The mentality of this book though, is that you should just start out running because it's the ""impossible"" thinking method. This book comes off to me as being very arrogant.We don't live in a perfect world and fault can be found in virtually anything if we look hard enough to find it. This book is written on the false premise that anything that isn't ""the best"", simply isn't good enough. This is very similar to a classic form of pseudoreasoning whereby anything that is not perfect (i.e., ""the best""), is rejected."
2,uninspiring,"as another person mentioned, i have never been left with such a bad taste in my mouth that i have actually wanted to come write a review, but i really DID NOT enjoy nor grow from reading this book. i thought the ideas were ambiguous. there were no concrete strategies laid down concerning how to break free of the old/form new mental models. i recieved niether inspiration, nor helpful tools for change. ""as a man thinketh"" contains in it's twenty some odd pages far more thought provoking and mind expanding ideas than this two hundred and something paged book. and as for models thelearningweb.net has more helpful information than this book did, and there it's all free.."
3,"Perception, Psychology and Shifting Mental Models","If you've never read anything before about the subjective and limited nature of human perception and mental models, this book is a good recap of the research conducted and reported over the last 50 years. If you have read much of that material, this book will strike you as simplistic, dated and slow-moving.The book improves when it reaches chapters 9 and 12 where the authors share practical advice for challenging your own thinking. Most people will find helpful material in those sections. But there's a lot of book to wade through before you get those parts.If you haven't attended college yet and don't know much about perception and psychology, you will probably find this to be a four or five star book."
3,Not as good as some of the other books out there,"This is basically a self-help book for professionals and while it does offer some good advice, it's not offering anything revolutionary or extraordinarily new that couldn't be found in books that approach the same subject more dynamically. The authors provide a couple stories and some ideas on how to go about transforming the business of your life, but they don't follow through significantly with exercises that can challenge their readers to follow through on the ideas. It's an ok book, but it's not one I'd recommend to a friend if they wanted to reinvent their life."
3,This book was OK.,"I enjoyed reading the book but I cannot say that I am a huge fan of this type of literature. Its great if you really like exercising your brain but I normally enjoy reading as a relaxation activity and not so much for heavy learning, which I do at school.If you're the kind of person that likes these types of books you will definitely enjoy this one. The author makes some very valid points and even in cases where you do not agree, you can see the merit of the arguments used."
3,Not as fantastic as I had expected.,"For all the hype on these guys (and you can bet its not being spread by MTV) they just can't seem to live up to it. At least not here anyways. A Bunch of hypnotic tracks that don't seem to do much than just ""be there."" If you like Gothic Rock, and I do, then you probably know that they all have a stark contrast in musical styles. And these guys find a happy medium between jarring walls-of-noise like The Wake and the atmospheric stuff like The Shroud. Lyrically it's not that repugnant satanic stuff that automatically drives me light-years away, so I could learn to enjoy it. I'd much rather be listening to the Manic Street Preachers though. So, back to the Manics."
4,A good (re)introduction,"This album is a great collection of live and rare tracks, and the little extras make this an excellent album for new and old fans of LAM. Whether it be the jarring atmosphere of songs like ""Letter to God"" or the plaintive acoustic version of ""Claire's Horrors,"" LAM is definately shown to be muti-faceted in both their music and their lyrics. I also found the cover of ""Sally's Song"" from Nightmare Before Christmas to be just adorable, and ""The Christmas Song,"" is definately one of my new fave holiday tunes."
3,"Thinnest of Air, Blues Traveler at Red Rocks","This was not a very good DVD. They needed to move the concert to disk one and have evry thing else on disk two. With that being said, in general, this concert sucks. I have seen them before and they are way better than this live. I really don't know what happend, but Popper couldn't sing half the songs even close to how I've heard them done before. Also, the set list was terrible, most of it was the crap songs from the newer CD's. Now I will say that I am so glad I didn't have to listen to another crappy version of Run-around. But I did have to listen to them butcher Hook(again). I really think half of the problem with them live, is they try to jam way too much and cut the rhythms so much in order to pull off the long jam sessions that they lose it. Oh well, at least I didn't buy this dvd set, I watched it on NetFlix Instant. If you have it, I recommend you do the same."
2,disappointing,"This book started out with some promise, however the character development never fully pans out. Unfortunately the characters remain EXACTLY the same over a forty year span. They think nothing of their extramarital affairs, and remain shallow and generally unlikable. It seems Jaffe should not have tried to span so many years. I finished the book, only because I felt I should after reading half of it. I always finish a book when I start reading, but this one was a struggle. I really just didn't care anymore. There was a ""suprise"" ending but that gave little satisfaction because, again, by this time I just wasn't that interested in the characters."
2,This book is not very good,"I am disappointed and saddened because I am a big fan of Rona Jaffe. She is an amazing writer. I adore Class Reunion, and have just finished The Road Taken, which was one of the best books I have ever read.Having said that, I looked forward to this newest novel and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. It did not live up to my expectations. The characters are shallow and self centered. I never understood them, or their reasons for making the selfish choices that they made. I cannot even fathom why they would remain friends after sharing an apartment for a short time. I didn't care for any of them or what happened to them. There is one character who dies and we never really get to know her, For some reason, these women who have no morals, think about her from time to time.I feel cheated because I know Ms. Jaffe is capable of better writing than this."
3,Not great but worth the purchase price.,"No, it's not the best Rona Jaffe book ever written -- and I've read them all. But it was a page-turner and kept me interested until the end. I was pleased when I discovered it, and pleased that I bought it. It was definitely worth buying -- and reading."
2,Not the best Rona Jaffe ever,"Rona Jaffe has written many interesting books over the years. The latest Jaffe novel is more of a disappointment then a joy. In the opening chapters, the reader is introduced to four room-mates. Leigh, who wants to be an agent. Cady, the schoolteacher in love with a student's father. Stewardess Vanessa, the eldest of the pack. Oddball Susan, who shocks and disgusts her room-mates by exercising nude. And finally Charlie, the sweet ""house mascot"" of the bunch.Tragedy strikes the group over the passing years, but even with the upheaval caused, the characters failed to capture the imagination. The big revelation by one character at the end made me gasp, in utter disgust.Give this one a good long look before deciding to purchase for your personal library."
2,If I had a hammer...,"...I'd attack these utterly static characters with it. At the beginning of this book, I found the three main characters -- Leigh, Vanessa and Cady -- to be young, naive, selfish and foolish. At the end, I found them to be old, bitter, selfish and foolish. (Leigh is the only possible exception, as her personality putters to ""boring"" and stops there.)Had there been a single redeeming value in Vanessa or Cady, I'd have clung to it and given the book 3 stars. But more and more, I found myself wanting to knock their heads together. I read it through until the end to find out if they would experience a life-changing epiphany that would make them worthy of several hundred pieces of paper, but alas, no. These characters stick up for nothing.I suppose I'd have liked the book better if I could relate to the characters but frankly, I'm glad I can't."
2,Disappointing,"This novel follows the lives of 4 women just starting out in the early 60s and follows them through their lives as 50something women of the present.I was disappointed, not only with the writing, but with the portrayal of women as slightly vapid and only concerned about love and money. The careers of these women were definitely a tertiary focus, and made to seem less than a part of who they were.I read through to the end, hoping for some bigger value from the book, but found none."
2,"Sony TV's can't be beat, but your computers UTTERLY suck","I tend to avoid Sony Computers and External Burners like plague (The the Dream system (5.1DVD/CD player) is an incredible product for the price- and Sony's excellent camera's have the patended night-vision). I've had a alot of problems with my Vaio Tower. It does have every connection imaginable, but it won't run so many non-Sony programs like Stomp Music products, external burners and scanners, and at least 4 DVD importing programs that I tried, I did eventually get Sony's Vegas, but no DVD import, ridiculous. Vegas does work great for editing and other stuff. But alot of irritating things just ""happen"". I've seen a couple of strange failures in the laptops of people I work with, more so than others at least. There ARE people out there who swear by these, so that may be you too and I'm no guru, but I know a thing or two about computers and I don't like'em at all. Caveat."
5,Taming Andrew is awesome entertainment and information.,"Taming Andrew is a must see for anyone interested in child development and the consequences of the lack of guidance by a loving and responsive parent/guardian. The plot acurately portrays what took place in real life when andrew is kidnapped by his criminal father at an early age and returned about age eight. Andrew has had neither love or parenting during his captivity. It is now up to mother, who loves him very much, to make up for the lost socialization and bonding processes that are essential in those early years. Highly Recommended, without any reservation!!!"
3,Very best of Mac Davis,I was disappointed that it did not have Hooked on Me as that was one of his biggest. Not even a real picture on front cover. Shame on me for not investigating a bit more before purchase. Did receive in a tim ely manner
4,"If you like Mac Davis, you'll like this CD","Look, if you are reading this review, you probably already know all the songs on this CD. Though there are a few other songs that could be included, these got the most airplay on rock/pop stations.For those new to Mac Davis, during his hey-day his songs might have been described as country-lite or folk-pop. Many songs were covered by other artists. He also dabbled as an actor, playing the role of a pro-quarterback in the movie ""North Dallas Forty,"" supposedly loosely based upon real Dallas Cowboys quarterback Don Meredith.In any event, enjoy the music."
4,Mac Davis: Very Best and More,"I also bought this CD for the funny ""It's hard to be humble"". Then I discovered other songs like ""Rodeo Clown"" which are very good country music. I am sad, that I did not know this singer earlier. I can really recommend this CD."
4,Tasty,I tried a sample of this and really like the taste. It's orangey but also cinnamony. I felt a little weird about putting something with orange dye in it on my teeth though.. what if it stains my teeth that color?
2,Like bad candy.,The Good: It has fluoride and most of the other attributes a good paste should.The Bad: Tastles like cheap candy. Bears little if any resemblance to the taste of oranges or orange juice. Tube is hard to get paste out of once it is more than half empty.I will not be buying it again.
5,More than a recipe book,"I enjoy reading Regan's descriptions of cocktails, their recipes and histories, but also included are explanations about every aspect of the bartending craft. I appreciate his advice on tasting each ingredient to arrive at a properly balanced drink."
4,Damn Fine Book and Cheap to Boot,"While it lacks the drink porn photos of other books, it contains a lot of good solid information and technique.Think of it as the Penthouse Forum of Cocktail Books rather than the glossy centerfold.For those who like their drinks in a written more cerebral form, with plenty of titillation and well wrought detail, this one is for you. Full of technique,recipes and drink pillow talk for before during and after the consummation of your cocktail."
4,Will Make You Drink More,Very interesting and has caused me to crave a good cocktail more often. Just now getting into the recipes. I have become the amateur mixologist with my family and always enjoy trying new things. I really love how this book equips you with the knowledge to begin to come up with variations of the classic martinis. I highly recommend this book.
3,A tale of why we stick together,"This book provides the history of scientific thought into why things stick together. The book begins with a review of ancient Greek science, and the concept of atoms - objects too small to be divided. The text then picks up in the Enlightenment when scientists like Newton are pondering the question of how the physical world came about, and using experiments to guide their ideas. The major scientific discoveries and discoverers in the field of cohesion are detailed, including both theorists and experimentalists. These cover the fields of quantum mechanics, electrostatics, chemistry, and surface science. Basic principles are laid out such that any college student in science or engineering can understand the text. Overall, an insightful book, though not the most entertaining book to read."
3,Just ok,"The Pine, sandlewood, and green tea from the same brand have the natural sense which is much better than this amber one, won't buy again."
3,ITS SPOUSED TO BE ABOUT JESSICA BUT ITS REALLY NOT!,"Its was kinda good but its spoused to be aobut Jessica and her new college boyfriend. But they only have like one chapter about that. The whole book is mostly about Elizebeth. Like what will she do to help out her sister, her and Todd having some problems. This whole book just revloves around Elizebeth not Jessica. I was very disapointed about this book. Next time they should give a descreption about Elizebeth instead of Jessica!!"
2,Jessica Does it again,"I think this book was alright, but it would have been great if that Jssica hadn't gotten away with murder, as usual. And if Elizabeth hadn't let herself get manipulated by Jessica."
1,Not worth the content,"This book is overprice. It has very limited instructions how to use VI 6.0 and not informative. To beginners please look for another one, your penny per page is worthless."
5,Book 2 In One Of My Favorite Trilogies,"This trilogy is a great pick for any Raistlin fans, and even Caramon fans. This book is a great sequel and delves even deeper into the relationship between the twins.The sickly, magic-inclined brother manipulates his friends, family, and even time itself to achieve what he thinks he wants. Caramon comes to understand and even accept his brother for who he is."
5,Another great Dragonlance novel,"Despite what some people think about this book, I think this was a great novel. Sure, it lacked excitement in some places, I will agree with that. The plot is a bit sluggish at times, and the book is better if you have time on your hands because once you start, I guarantee you'll not stop reading until the end. There are some wonderfully written parts in this book. For example, the scene with Caramon and the rabbit proves that, despite what most people think, Raistlin is only human after all. Come to think of it, that is one of the best parts in the book, IMO. This is a must have for any fan of the Dragonlance Saga."
3,Little slow,"Little confused with the opening chapters, after reading the book that is first in this series. Little on the slow side."
3,"Not awful, not good.","Put it this way, OK. OK is the word for it, it has some action and some pure boredom. As The Time of The Twins it has a complicated plot. I like how they traveled back in time. An ok book, read it if you have a lot of time."
4,cute,This story begins with a little boy at the playground. He discovers the slide. He thinks that it's just a really neat chair. Some other kids at the playground have to show him what it is. He wants to try but he's really scared of the slide. The kids at the playground encourage him and he really enjoys his ride on the slide. He wants to go again and again!With one phrase and drawing a page it's sure to keep the little ones attention. Perfect book for toddlers and babies.Perfect book for toddlers and babies. The book is make of sturdy paper pages making it easy for little hands to turn!
5,"You go, girl!","A spirited little girl leads a pack of boys at the playground and encourages a timid newcomer boy to go down the slide. Expressive, fun pictures with minimal text. We love all of Kit Allen's books including Galoshes and Sweater... nice subtle humor."
5,"Disco's ""Bad Girl"", I mean that in a good way! RIP Donna Summer","Donna Summer may have passed away, but here songs will live on forever.This is my favorite LP (actually a double LP set) by her.This has many songs that were FM classics (Hot Stuff, the title track, Dim All The Lights, Our Love, Walk Away, and Sunset People), and turntable classics as well.sides 1, 2, and 4 are all disco tracksside 3 is a side of ballads.Recommended!"
5,Gotta Love Donna,Hi: I had this album but lost it in a move. So I looked for it at amazon and found it I love Donna Summers! Old school 70's music is the best. Millie
4,AN IMPORTANT ALBUM,"My mother bought his album for me back in 1979. I enjoyed it so much over the years that I bought the CD in 1997. I'm really perplexed by the fact that this incredible set has been ignored by many people. It is an important album for a couple of reasons. First, it catapulted Donna Summer into superstardom. Second, it was the first album to mix elements of disco music with rock and roll. There are 15 tracks on it, and all of them are first rate. It is amazing but you can actually listen to the entire album without skipping songs. My personal favorites: ""Hot stuff"", 'Bad Girls"", ""Dim all the lights"", ""Walk away"" and ""Lucky"". This album definetely deserves a place in the Top 500 albums of all time."
5,Text Books for classes,"I bought three books actually, for a class I am taking and thoroughly enjoy reading them. The wording is very reader friendly and geared to be understood by all. The titles of the books are as follows: Theology of the Prophetic Books by Donald E. Gowan; Introduction to the Prophets: Their Stories, Savings, and Scrolls, by Thomas L. Leclerc;and The Gift of Psalms, by Roland E. Murphy.These books came in a timely manner and the price was unbeatable as I checked with a local bookstore and found this to be the best venue with the lowest prices, a great service. I highly recommend the books and will continue to shop Amazon for all my book needs."
4,String Quartet ONLY!,This is an excellent CD to get the feel for a STRING QUARTET. I would suggest only purchasing it if you need help deciding what your string quartet will play - and remember a string quartet sounds LOVELY but is not the same a a single violinist or orchestra.It's a good buy for VILOIN LOVERS - and If you're like me - having a STRING QUARTET AT YOUR WEDDING! Good luck!
2,Not very good.,"I got this CD for my wedding and to be honest I didn't like the the sound. It wasn't clear at all.I was so upset I wasn't going to buy any more CDs Then my friend who is a classical musician told me to try the""Classical Wedding Traditions"" CD from Amazon[.com]I like this CD very much because it is very clear and you can hear each musician. I finally have some good music for my wedding."
4,convenient,"Opens tall and short cans with ease. A little tough to get the can locked in initially, but it may be due to my rheumatoid arthritis, which is the reason I bought this instead of using a hand held opener. Overall, it does quick work of getting the cans opened and the knife sharpener in the back is handy thing to have!"
2,Don't Bother,"This book is based on Mac OS 8 as conceived in the""Copland"" days (back when it was intendedto be the ""next-generation"" operatingsystem for Mac OS.) Although some ofthe topics are relevant and interesting,this is NOT a book about the Mac OS 8that was released in July of 1997.Buyer beware."
3,More than just coax,This coax is some of the best coax that money can buy. Very low loss for those projects in the VHF and above range. Couple that with the fact that it comes with N-type connectors already installed and you have a product here that is reayd to use as soon as you open the package.
4,Entertaining continuance of story,"I won't go into details of the plot, others have already done so. Suffice it to say I enjoyed this addition to the Candace Steele story, although I was irritated by her continuing to deny Ash, despite his obvious love for her. *shrug* Of course, who is to say how one would react, but I was VERY angry at her continuing to blame him for ""attacking her in the elevator in San Francisco"" when her flashbacks in the first book CLEARLY show that she asked for him to turn her, then changed her mind at exactly the last minute. To put this into understandable terms: think if it had been actual intercourse, instead of him turning her into a vampire. She lets him get RIGHT to the brink, then says nope changed my mind, get off and later yells rape. THAT is exactly the situation in a nutshell and that drives me MAD. But otherwise, I did enjoy the book - lots of action, great mystery, etc."
4,"Good Read,Unexpected Ending","Actually read all the three books. Enjoy it very much however the ending sucks!!! I mean paranormal romance, pleeasee...i want a happy ending!!!! I agree with some readers that there should be a follow up on the story on ASH and CANDACE why the abrupt ending of him dying/dead? is that another way telling the readers that the series are ending?..Well still think as the reader,we need the happy ending. The only story i know where the hero died is in THE SILVER KISS by ANNETTE CURTIS KLAUSE and this is in a different genre. Young Adult book about a vampire."
4,"Interesting book, better than the first.","A word of warning, read reviews of the third book before you start the series or buy this one.Luscious Craving follows Passionate Thirst in the series. This book is the best of the three in character development, writing, plot, etc... The style of the book is a bit different from the first, there isn't as much jumping between the present and the past. A lot of time is spent in the casino and in a study of Ash's history with a mysterious group of vampires known as the board.The Casino is hosting a charity poker tournament, and rumor has it that the tournament is going to be scammed, hijacked, or rigged by the local vampires. Candace finds herself entangled with high rollers, the vampire underbelly of the Strip, and trying to provide security for the tournament. Investigating the plot against the tournament forces Candace to work with her vampire ex-boyfriend Ash."
2,Disappointing,"THis 'feminist life' doesnt have the depth or insight of the brilliant authorised biography of Vera Brittain by Berry and Bostridge (published by Northeastern University Press). Gorham hardly touches on Brittain's pacifism, and her book ends in 1940, thirty years before Brittain's death. For a very readable and authoritative biography of Vera Brittain, try Vera Brittain: A Life by Paul Berry (Vera Brittain's friend) and Mark Bostridge (a young biographer)"
2,Inaccurate,"I have been studying Vera Brittain for my final year coursework and found the authorised life by Berry and Bostridge (1995) a good deal more authoritative, readable and enjoyable than Gorham's study. Gorham is inaccurate and weighed down by out of date theory. Susan Kingsley Kent clearly hadn't read the authorised biography when she recommended Ms Gorhams' book. After Testament of Youth itself, I would strongly urge readers interested in Brittain to buy the Bostridge-Berry biograhy."
1,Tedious,"I found this to be a tedious read with shallow cardboard characters. Definitely not on par with Niven's other works (Tales of Known Space series.) If you want an entertaining and thought-provoking post-apocalyptic novel, try Alas Babylon."
1,Awful,"I bought this book interested in reading about how people would react in a post-apocalyptic world. Instead I read a soap opera. As one reviewer wrote, the first 200 pages are spent introducing the characters and what a boring 200 pages they are. Unfortunately, it doesn't get much better from there. Instead of outlining how resourceful some of the characters are in order to survive, the authors are preoccupied with race and sex (more characters than you can believe are more worried about sex than where they are going to get their next meal). If you would like to read a good post-apocalypse book take a look at Alas, Babylon. A little dated (cold war) but a much better read than this."
1,Democracy is dispensable? Get this at the library.,"There is a lot to like about this book; it's a smart treatment of the subject matter. I found it entertaining at the beginning, though my ability to care about the characters or even the fate of the earth eroded to nothing by the end.Racism and sexism can be portrayed without implying that the reader should agree with racist and sexist attitudes. However, I'm afraid nothing in this narrative actually suggests that one should regard either its vile depiction of black people or its characters' paternalist attitudes with a critical eye.Also, the characters reinvent feudalism/monarchy without any apparent regret or even self-awareness, so the message seems to be that preserving democracy is not important to saving civilization.If you must pay money for it, get a used copy, and be prepared to hold your nose."
1,Dated,"Written back in 1977, this book was all of he '70's disaster movies wrapped into one long and boring novel. The only thing missing was OJ Simpson in a security guard uniform! It was a struggle just trying to get past the first 200 pages or so, that's how long it took the authors to introduce all of the characters in this book. When the comet hit it didn't get any better....only worse! After suffering through a little more than half way through this slow paced disaster I just skimmed ahead and finally put it down for good. If your looking for a good post apocalyptic book pass this one up."
4,Good End of Civilization Read,"Picture the movie Armageddon set in the 70's. But instead of blowing the asteroid (comet in the book) up, it hits. The desription of the devestation of southern California is obviously well thought out and described. Also the authors do a good job with what would happen to people immediately after the destruction of civilization. (grouping together, canibalism etc.) I wish more was written about what happens in other parts of the country and world though, the entire book is set in California. If you liked Swan Song by Robert McCammon (McGammon?) Or The Stand you will probably like this book."
3,not as good as i'd been told,tedious start. i think they were trying to show that s.f. could be literature.
3,Buy it on sale...,"Tedious read, felt like work actually finishing this book.Slightly better than working however...Book was written in the 70's and has some interesting ideas on surviving. And does make one wonder what the US would be like if Kalifornia was underwater after a meteor strike"
5,THIS BOOK IS NOW AND WILL REMAIN A CLASSIC,"I REAK THIS BOOK AT IT'S FIRST RELEASE. AND A COUPLE OF TIME SINCE. WITH THE COMET/ ASTEROID CRAZE NONE HAVE COME CLOSE WITH STORYLINE, BELIEVABLITY, AND SHEER HUMAN SUSPENCE. READ IT YOU WILL LOVE IT. (JUST GET PAST THE OUTDATED SCIENCE)"
3,Lucifer's Hammer,Too many characters introduced in the beginning were hard to keep track of. The actual catastrophe took a bit too long buillding up.
5,Lucifer's Hammer - a Great Read,"I first read a battered copy of this book years ago, and I was fascinated by it then. Having the opportunity to put it on my Kindle was a chance I couldn't pass up, and I'm glad I'm didn't. It's STILL a great book, telling tales of bravery and cowardice, kindness and cruelty, and the human need to keep on living despite horrific, post apopylyptic conditions. Highly recommended!"
2,End of the world apocalypse....eventually,"I read this book years ago. I can't understand the ""rave"" reviews. I know you have to build up your characters and all but 250 pages to even spot the doom coming? Then all the apocalyptic stuff finally occurs, but by then I was too bored to care."
4,A fantastic but somewhat dated glimpse into a post apocolytic humanity.,"Fantastic glimpse into the dark side of humanity in a post apocalyptic world. I read this book originally 25 years ago and recalled it fondly enough to download it again on my Kindle. Reading it again with the experience of witnessing the LA riots and the hell that was the Katrina disaster I saw the book in an entirely different light. 25 years ago I read the book as pure science fiction and an enjoyable read, I now see it as a not so farfetched expose on the inhumanity that can and does occur in the absence of the rule of law in any disaster situation much less an apocalypse.The book is dated in terminology and the societal prejudices of the 1970's and is a bit slow getting going as the authors introduce the reader to a rather large cast of characters leading up to ""Hammer Fall"". But from there on it's a roller-coaster ride."
4,Compelling,"A gripping story, though you could be forgiven for being annoyed at the presence of some of the minor characters - it's hard not to say ""wait, who the heck is Colleen"" at some point.The accusations of racism I saw on other reviews surprise me. There are bigoted white characters and bigoted black characters. There are white heroes and black heroes (well, one black hero) as well, and none of the bigots are heroes.I was not alive during the 70s so I can't speak to the accuracy of the race relations depicted but I didn't see anything indicating racism on the part of the author."
4,wow... didn't think it was that bad...,"Alright, admittedly it has been a long time since I read the thing, but I really didn't think it was all that bad. In fact, when I read it, I actually thought it was pretty good... maybe it's due for a re-read from a new and older perspective."
4,Hamner Time,"Dated? Maybe. Racist? Nah.Probably my second favorite Apocalyptic novel, (after The Stand). It provides a few more gray shades in a familiar palette of Good and Evil B&W.; The thrills and chills still stand up though and there are some high tension pages that rival the best of the breed. A must for any fan of the genre."
5,A Fabulous Book,"This WAS the book that first got me into science fiction, and over 30 years later, it is a lover affair that has stood the test of time. The book does start off somewhat slowly, as some of the earlier reviews noted, but like a rock rolling down a hill, it picks up momentum as the story goes. I particularly loved the descriptions of the physical effects on Earth of the meteor striking the planet, and wished that there had been a little bit more detail about that. However, my only real complaint was that there was no sequel--I would love to have learned what happened ""after the ending""!"
4,Very good exploration of the end of the world,"The comet hits the Earth, but that is only the beginning---the best part of the book is what comes after. It comes pretty close to describing what the aftermath of an earth shattering event might be. A lot is crammed in there, and you get the impression that the authors could have gone on much longer, but they had to stop it somewhere. The best part of reading the book is realizing how many things we have today that we take for granted."
3,When these two authors team up...,"You can bet that there's gonna be some fantastic science, and some really well-thought out plot, and a whole lot of exposition to explain it to everyone just a bit more than is absolutely necessary, and characters that are essentially cardboard cutouts with little signs around their necks saying, ""Useless Hot Chick"", ""High-minded scientist,"" ""Practical Scientist,"" and so forth.Please understand that this isn't really the genre that I'm used to. I don't read hard SF very often, and to me character is a bit more important. I WAS impressed by the science in the story, but I wanted more characterization that some cliched lines about how the reporter's wife was useless and so it's okay that he slept with someone else. I'd consider it sexist, but the characterizations are soft all around. It's just that the female stereotypes are more obnoxious. It would have been nice to have a female scientist."
4,"Good story, realistic, thought provoking","Despite it's age, Niven's Lucifer's Hammer holds it's own. It presents an excellent telling of what could be the end of the world, and is very realistic about how people would respond while still telling a compelling story of survival.I listened to the audiobook and while the quality of the narration was not an issue, it was not as animated as other audiobooks I have listened to recently.Worth the read or listen if you are an SF fan or survivalist. Makes me want to stockpile food and safety equipment."
5,"Spell Binding ,Can't put it down.","I don't remember where I got this book at. Once I picked it up, it was like an addiction. Every chance I got I was back reading it. I've read this three times cover to cover. It will make you look up and wonder."
3,"Niven and Pournelle let ""Lucifer's Hammer"" hit with a thud","It is unfortunate that a novel of with such tremendous potential winds up being an overly long, often confusing piece of science fiction. In the case of ""Lucifer's Hammer"", there are simply too many people and too much story to keep up with.The premise is interesting enough...a newly discovered comet on a collision course with Earth. This in and of itself made me pick up the book initially. But the sheer number of characters and various subplots doomed this story. The fact that it is over 600 pages, in small type, doesn't help, either.Still, for the hard-core science-fiction fan, ""Lucifier's Hammer"" may be worth the purchase, simply because of its historical value and significance."
5,Lucifer's Hammer,"this book is timeless, I read it thirty years ago and reread it again because I was so much impressed the first time."
5,"Had to buy a new copy, AGAIN","I am in awe. After being away from this book for a couple of years I decided to reread it on the recommendation of a friend who is a Y2K expert. He recommends this book as a primer in what could (he believes will) happen come 1/1/00. Even though it is set in LA and the surrounding area it gives me enough background so that I could have walked the trails that the charectars did. I recommend this book to any reader of any genre to get an idea of what can/will be happening in a little over a year from now (as of this writing). I agree with another reviewer, Larry and Jerry, tell us how the new world turns out!!"
2,Episodic and Boring,"The 2 stars are solely for the bits in italics and the part where the comet actually hit. The rest of book was shallow and episodic. Without giving away details of the plot (for anyone who wishes to read it), I'll simply say that the tale would have benefited from fewer characters and a simplified plot. There were too many elements in the post-comet strike world which prevented the author from deepening the characters of the people involved. I was quickly bored, and it became matter of will to finish it."
2,Could not finish it.,"The premise was interesting, and reminded me of the movies Armaggedon and Deep Impact, because they are very much alike. After the comet fell, however, I disliked the story so much I just looked up a summary on the Internet and I won't be finishing it."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Meteors, asteroids, what else can you hit the earth with and write a book about it? How about a comet? Yep, that is what has been done here. Apart from sounding cooler, you get the usual nastiness and struggles as those alive in the aftermath have to deal with trying to stay alive.New power structures, violence and eating take up a lot of the time."
2,so-so,"I expected great things from this book; however, it's pretty dated. Don't expect much. this might have been original back in the day, but not any more."
1,resist the temptation to automatically praise the unpraiseworthy,"No matter what accolades you may throw at Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle, whether individually or as a team, they don't apply to Lucifer's Hammer. The book was a crashing bore, an umpteenth rehash of an extremely tired motif, and--a la Stephen King (and I don't mean so flatteringly)--an evident attempt to kill as many trees and expend as much ink as possible. We get well past page 300 before the first hint of significant sci-fi action (as opposed to random sex and violence) crops up. I lost interest shortly thereafter: I believe that 375 pages or so are more than enough to invest in a quest for something to merit further reading. Nope. Pass on this clinker."
1,No thanks,"This book can basically be divided into three parts. Number 1: The comet is coming! The comet is coming! Maybe it will miss! Number 2: Comet hits. This is where the book picks up slightly, but then...Number 3: Civilization is destroyed, black people are made to sound evil.I found this book boring for two-thirds, and pretty unbelievable in many areas (It's the end of the world, hurrah! No more taxes! Also 'We have to rebuild society, but let's talk about this fine piece of CRYSTAL first.') Try for a better Doomsday novel."
1,racist depictions of blacks spoil this book,"Lucifer's Hammer begins as an entertaining book -The parts about the comet striking the earth,and how almost everything is wiped out holdsthe reader's attention - But then, what towe get? A group of black people who aredepicted as CANNIBALS...- and led by a deranged whiteman, at that! Even here, black people can't acton their own! Not only that, by the end ofthe book, they end up being forced into slaveryand beaten into submission by some sadisticRussian character - and this is something Ishould accept? - As a black reader, I foundthis grossly offensive - no matter how inter-esting the rest of the book might me. thesesections of it make the entire thing unaccept-able (By the way, it was years ago when I firstread this book, and I can still remember howoffensive it was, and still is!)"
1,It bored me,"I thought I would love Lucifer's Hammer, but I was very disappointed. I loved Footfall so I thought I would like this as well. I gave up on it after 300 pages.It was boring to me. It seemed like scenes dragged out forever, and even the comet hitting seemed boring. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters. They just seemed to wooden for me.I cant recommend Lucifer's Hammer. It was a big bore to me."
1,Encouraging how many saw this for the dreck it was,"This is movie of the week, soap opera, bestseller schlock written by plodding, prosaic hacks for zombie readers who want to read about what they already know.Every character, every scene, every word of dialog in this glop of schmaltz you've seen before. Nothing here will surprise you or shock you with freshness or originality. That's why it's popular.That so many recognize it for what it is encourages me.If you do want to read sci fi that is apocalyptic, fresh, shocking and inspiring of awe, read thisHer Smoke Rose Up Foreverby James Tiptree."
2,Which one's family was murdered by environmentalists?,"I read this quite a few years ago, skimmed Fallen Angel, and began to wonder, which one's family had been killed by environmentalists?Really, in both books evil environmentalists are out to destroy society, in this book, using cannabalism to bind people together and bend them to their will. Who new recycling was the gateway behavior for cannabalism?!?I give it a 'meh', if you want to read it, find it used in paperback for a buck, or check your local library."
5,great book,"I can see why everyone keeps recommending this book. I really enjoyed it, one of the better apocalyptic sci-fi books I've read in a while."
3,"Solid concept, decent execution","The heart of the story is great: global catastrophe caused by meteor strikes. Unfortunately the story takes a long time to build, as well as introduces far too many characters via uninteresting short stories which makes them very forgettable. Flipping back through after finishing, I remembered there's a guide at the beginning putting names to ""roles"" that would have come in helpful more than a few times throughout just to keep them all straight.Some of the stories are gripping and draw you in to the story, others feel dull and do little other than increase the page count. All in all a decent read if you don't mind having to sift through to find the great parts."
3,"Well-written, starts strong, ends badly","This classic is very well-written and starts off quite strongly, but it gets increasingly ridiculous towards the end. Between the immediate return to feudalism, the religious fanatic cannibals,and the 'necessity' of saving a nuclear power plant that would not have been able to keep running anyway, it was terribly over-done. This book also has a helping of Niven's usual sexism, but it is not anywhere near as present as it is in some of his other books. There is also a racist undertone throughout the text (the cannibals are all black)."
4,Lucifer's Hammer is exactly what you expect,"At first, I was a little worried about reading Lucifers Hammer, expecting it to be somewhat outdated and too long. I was mistaken. While it did take me a while to get into it (it's a very long book with a very slow start), I eventually got the hang of the story and couldn't put it down.The story reminded me of Deep Impact mixed with Armageddon. I really enjoyed it, found the characters to be believable, and the decisions being made were very interesting and thought provoking. I would recommend it, but not as good as my favorite post-apocalyptic novel- ""One Second After."""
4,Lucifer's Hammer,"I have enjoyed this book for a number of years, which is why I bought it, yet again. I always seem to give away my favorites, but this one, on my kindle will stay with me."
4,fun book,"Fun book, for those of us who like end-of-civilization/dystopian/survivalist stories (Mad Max, The Stand, etc.) The authors write a fairly convincing tome, and how people solve the basic human-needs problems."
3,Large scale disasters that have no chance of recovery soon,"I've read this book at least 3 times in the last 10 years. I keep coming back because I am interested in the science of this type of disaster. Read *Uriel's Machine*, by Knight and Lomas if you want real accounts and historical proof of what happens when a comet impacts the earth. This story is very good, the plot is complete, but the limitations are in what your mind can fill in. It is a PLEASURE reading material and some would do much to remember that. Serious books get the type of review criticism that others here seem to forget. This is a huge seller, and the main reason is it is a page turner. All of the other reviews good and bad FINISHED the book, so it must be at least worth that. Take a shot and read this one."
4,"Great science, slowish start but great finish","A sequel would be great, but that's unlikely at this point. Either way, this was a well researched and executed novel that I enjoyed very much."
4,End of the world page turner,"This is not a zombie book, but there are some surprises in it. I have always loved this book and read my paperback to shreds.If you like end of world scenario books, this is a must read. It drags in some places, but you quickly slide past them and get right back into the heart of the book."
4,Oh my god! A thoughtful extrapolation of a comet strike!,"Yep, this book is actually a thoughtful (and scientifically researched) examination of what ""the end of the world"" might cause. There were some extraneous characters and the ruminations of the survivors sometimes ran a bit long (as does the book--640 pages), but overall this was a very engaging read. I'm not quite sure why some reviewers thought the depiction of cannibalism in this book was so graphic or so disturbing. In my opinion, it was neither. Cannibalism is a real phenomenon, and the description of the ""ritual"" was far from horrific."
4,"Review of recent Kindle purchase of ""Lucifer's Hammer"".","A well written story, with enough scientific background, to convince you this kind of disaster could happen, and how modern humans would handle such an event. The pacing of the story and the tension were perfect, as far as I was concerned. Read this in paperback years ago, but lost my copy. The title came to my attention recently and I just had to get it downloaded to my Kindle. eh"
3,"Disaster and Doom, oh my!","This is a pretty good book, though I found it a little preachy. The disaster itself is, unlike most science fiction disasters, actually possible (just ask the dinosaurs). And if a giant comet did hit the Earth, it would pretty much cause a breakdown of civilization. The only problem I had with Lucifer's Hammer was the sense I got that the authors actually were enjoying the whole thing, since it gave them a chance to kill off characters based on kinds of people they don't really like. It was a little cold-blooded, for example, when the survivors who have technology are eagerly turning away survivors who are simply struggling to survive. Realistic? Maybe. But it hardly made the major characters in this book sympathetic, and I would have enjoyed the book more if the authors had spent more time on the overwhelming emotional shock of having the world come to an end, instead of just how exciting it would be."
1,Boring junk,I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking. I had too many times where I had to re-read several sentences to figure out who was saying what about whom. 85 pages in and it still had nothing to keep me reading. I gave up. Money in the toilet!
1,Painfull,I kept waiting for the book to get going after 150 pages I gave up. An over abundence of charater developement that seems trivial.
3,A bit dated,"I read this book back when it was new, then picked it up again last month (I ran out of books to read!) and read it all over again. I have to say, I was more impressed with it the first time I read it. Nowadays, it's terribly dated and plods along at a snails pace. Still, back in the day it was riveting new material. I read a similar book recently that uses the same 'meteors smash into earth' theme, but with a bit faster pace, Earth the new frontier, and it reminded me a lot of Lucifer's hammer."
2,Had to Put This One Down,"Part way through this book, there's a gruesome description of the murder/mutilation of a young woman that really made me sick. I literally threw the book in the trash and haven't read another Niven/Pournelle book since. My loss, I suppose, because I really enjoyed their stories, but enough is enough.Don't know if they ever fit into this story anything about humans having sex with aliens. That seems to crop up in a number of their collaborations. I wonder why.Anyway, I'm not squeamish, but there's enough graphic violence on the evening news. I don't need to read it in my recreational reading. For what it's worth, I had to put down Michener's The Source for the same reason: too much violence, and victimization of women at the hands of men."
4,"Can I call a huge disaster a ""fun read""?","The following of so many different characters as the story played out made for a great read. And even when you thought you knew everyone, someone else was mixed in. Makes you wonder how you yourself would react in the same situation."
5,"Worth the read, great story!","I actually picked up Lucifer's Hammer a few years ago, but never made it past the first ~100 pages. Amazon sent me a recommendation for it, so I decided to give it another go. I've always enjoyed THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT (TEOTWAWKI)fiction, whether it's zombies, aliens, comets, nuclear war, electromagnetic pulse, sun spots, solar flares, economic collapse, etc. Written in 1977, Lucifer's Hammer is timeless and will go down in history as one of the best ""end of world"" stories.While the first 100~200 pages are slow going, it is critical to set the conditions and character development, once the HAMMER falls, it is almost impossible to put down, by now you've formed a bond with the characters and want to know if they survive..."
3,So so.,Thought the premise was quite interesting. The first third of the book describing the run up to realization that the comet was going to hit was pretty compelling. However after that I thought the story lagged. I found the character development and writing just so so. All in all an average sci fi effort.
5,.,"An old book about the end of the world. It is somewhat dated as to the technology, but the story is excellent. Has a lot of characters that all pull together in the end"
5,"Wonderful, the best of its kind","There are many end of the world books, often using a well-aimed comet or asteroid to do the job (even authors such as Dennis Wheatley have written books of this genre). This is by far the best of the offerings that I have encountered. It has authentic detail and a very realistic scenario for the use of the technology then available (alte '70s or very early '80s).The characters are believable, the plot plausible and the novel really stands the test of time. What I like is the development and the realism... this is what an impact would really be like. Perhaps it should be required reading for some world leaders before it's too late.The most curious aspect of all is the way that reality caught up with the book. The discovery of Comet Hamner-Brown bears some astonishing similarities with the discovery (and discoverers) of Comet Hale-Bopp - a fact which amuses Alan Hale and Tom Bopp!"
5,"An excellent ""What if?""","This book is a wonderful, starkly realistic portrait of the end of civilization as we know it. Niven and Pournelle paint vivid pictures of multiple mega-tidal waves and constant hurricanes as fragments of a massive comet slam into the Earth. The survivors gather in a feeble attempt to stay alive as cannibles, thieves, robbers, religious fanatics, and murders roam the mountains after most of California is washed away. Niven and Pournelle have a knack for making their stories chillingly real. This book is not a noble account of humanity helping each other, but a gritty story about how they would act"
3,An impressive portrayal of frightening apocalyptic events.,"Larry Niven hit the nail on the head, with his story of the gargantuan comet that throws Earth, and society into chaos. The story development (including the character introductions and the unfolding set-up to the novel) was the perfect length, without throwing the comet into the story too early. The authors' depictions of the post- apocalyptic gangs which came to be were stunning, and brutally real, without any cowardly censorship, or gentle twists. Overall, the struggle to survive was effective as a steady clincher, but too often, I found the ""non- stop action and suspense"" lacking, when, at times, too many pages were devoted to boring descriptions and interpretations. However, these instances were far and few- between, and overall, this novel was an interesting look at what human nature can be reduced to, in the most horrible of circumstances."
3,Great Book - It is Marred by typical racial stereotyping,"Great disaster book with correct science. Unfortunately, the book perpetuates typical racial stereotypes - a few superhero blacks, with most blacks portrayed as drug addicts, cannibalistic, incompetents. Niven and Purnelle's final vision is one in which there are hardly any blacks, no hispanics, no asians and no indians. . His finally world is one in which white Americans continue to dominate the United States."
2,Uhhhhhhh,"Senselessly gory, unrealistic timeline and overall WAY overrated. if you are trapped in a hurricane or something and this is around, it is worth a trun thru. But don't go out of your way to get it.I am a fan of this genre of book, but was very disappointed in the story. It just wasn't any good. Like a flat coke. Alas Babylon is a lot better."
4,"Dated, but Interesting","This book tells the tale of how events might unfold after a catastrophic comet impact takes place. While saddled with some standard clichees of the genre (such as two-dimensional characters), it does contain a fascinating view of what life on Earth might be like after such an event. Originally published in 1977, much of the technological trappings are dated, but it's still a well-written page turner of a story.Some of the discussion of race in this book is definitely pre-PC, and left me a bit taken aback, but overall it's a worthwhile read for fans of sci-fi genre fiction."
3,"Lucifer's Hammer was a good book over all, it's just slow.","Lucifer's Hammer was a good book, but it starts out too slow for me. The first 100 pages or so are boring.I have not read many of his books but the ones I have read were better than this one. Still, you should read Lucifer's Hammer, it makes you wonder."
5,One of my favorite books,"This book is ""Armageddon"" and ""Deep Impact"" and ""The Postman"" all rolled into one, written years before any of the others. I was surprised that ""The Postman"" didn't list Lucifer's Hammer as the novel it was based upon. However, LH is so much more that any of the movies. Social commentary about the dregs of our society turns some liberal stomachs but rings true. Gripping page-turner that will challenge your ability to read a BIG book in one sitting, but you will WANT to."
4,A Deeper Impact,"Far better than the summer movie offerings, ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact,"" the novel is a readable story with a raft of characters. The standard ""good vs. evil"" battle at the end leaves a bit left to be desired. The best writing surrounds the post-impact mess. For fans of the apocalyptic genre, one could do much worse."
3,Starts with a bang ends with a whimper,"A bit disappointing for me to read. The overall scenario is great, no doubt but...the characters are only so so and the believability is spoiled by some pretty improbable coincidences.This book is based on the thesis that in a real crisis democratic governments do not work good enough and that people seek refuge in governments by force or by faith. In other words democracy is useless in a crisis. Hmm... maybe there is a point.All in all not a really bad book but it lacks in cohesion in the last chapters somewhat."
4,Worth reading,"I think this was an excellent look at a post-apocalyptic world. I can see influence here for many works that came later, including The Postman. Dated technology but it does not change the story much and it has aged remarkably well, which is the hallmark of great SciFi. I think the female characters are not very well developed, as I saw also in their other team-ups, but it is a minor issue and SciFi from this era was more idea driven than character driven."
4,It was a good read,"The story was kind of a bummer, but I guess there's no real way to depict an event like this without kind of being a bummer. I would recommend this book if you liked Patriots or One Second After."
5,Lucifers Hammer!,This is by far my favorite book. I had to purchase a hardcover edition for my bookcase.
2,A waste of money,"Sure it looks really cool to have a color stylus, but you could spend that same money on an even better program or game. Besides that though, there is nothing wrong with these styluses it just isn't worth the money."
3,Down market speakers and noisy disk drive detract,"I'm shocked no one seems to care that the 200GB hard drive that comes standard with this model whistles like a tea kettle. I called in the problem and the Sony authorized representative replaced the drive with another identical one. That one whistles, too. There simply isn't enough sound insulation. This is a problem when you are NOT watching loud DVDs obviously. I'm thinking of replacing the drive with something quieter--on my own nickel, of course.The other joke is the cheap speakers that aren't as good as my 5 year old Monsoon speakers. Plus they are definitely unaesthetic looking. They really are a disappointment. Mine are available for anyone who wants them."
2,Great design but poor quality,"This is a handsom bag design with great features such as quick release clip, integral reflector strip and rear light attachment which unfortunately had THREE things break on the bag within the first 2 months using it. First the fixer (quick release clip) broke while I was snapping the bag on the bike. After returning it, the guys at the bike shop replaced it no charge but soon the zipper broke off on it's own while I was riding. That was annoying, but was able to open and close the bag with my finger nail. Now, today while I was riding I heard a noise at my back tire and turned around to see the bag was caught in the rear fork because the second, replaced fixer BROKE AGAIN! I didn't overload the bag at all- just my house key and wallet with room to spare.I can't believe so many things can break on a simple bag all by themselves without trauma. I liked the design, but unfortunately will not be buying another Topeak bag again."
5,Topeak bag system,"I love the concept behind these Topeak bags. They're easy to attach and remove. I bought this larger one hoping to have room for tools and a light jacket; it works, but is pretty tight. I attached it to my road bike and took off. After about 40 miles, I went over a rough spot in the road and the clip broke off on the bag. I was rather surprised as these bags are intended for mountain bikes. I was able to get the whole bag replaced, but it will be frustrating if this happens again. I would recommend the medium bag; you won't be tempted to overstuff it!"
2,Topeak ad misleading,"I bought this bag because the picture showed the pack attaching with the fixer to the upright (diagonal) part of the rails. When the product arrived, I saw that the fixer only attaches to the horizontal part of the rails. The picture is misleading, and neither Topeak nor the seller took responsibility for the irresponsible and misleading advertising. Topeak's customer service not only was unhelpful, they gave me wrong advice, and the seller demands a 15% restocking fee if I return it. So be very careful if you order this, make sure it will work for your saddle."
5,this book is a pulse pounding thriller.,a terrible but ever more realitic threat to american national security is represented by nuclear extortion emanating from the third world.in this finely crafted novel the authors depict such a harrowing scenario.it is played out to perfection with deft insight into the geopolitical conditions that could create such afrightening event;
5,an important fact.,"individuality is very important. it will give you an identity. victoria, the main character, likes to be called egg and loves sci-fi and fantasy. she is her own self and doesn't care what other people think. it's sort of a reminder to me that i myself need to be an individual no matter how much you take it to heart. it has a message for me and hopefully to you too."
3,"Great, But lacked substance.","I started off the book with no energy, and it seemed really unrealistic, and very idealistic - and I didn't like that until later in the book when it got deeper into her personality, and I felt kind of a resemblence between us. But ultimately it's hard to feel the book.It did get better towards the end but left me feeling like something was missing from it."
2,anti-individuality morality play,"book starts out sympathetic to the loner's perspective, then three quarters through does an about face and tells us the main character is ""a big baby who can't stop being angry"". obviously it's not constructive to walk around with the attitude that you're better than everyone, but neither is pushing the idea that if you don't fit in with your peers the problem must be you and you should change."
3,Boy Proof,"""Boy Proof"" was not as strange as I thought it would be, but it was a little peculiar in places. Victoria, or Egg, as she renamed herself after the heroine in her favorite movie, `Terminal Earth', is a fairly introverted geek and, at first, she likes it that way...but then Max moves to her school and indirectly helps her find herself, Victoria, both separate and together with Egg."
5,Lives up to the Wrox Name,"I helped in the review of this title and can honestly say this title had a lot of thought put into creating a book that can actually be used in the real world. XML is very popular now and being used all over. .Net has just been released by MS. This book will show you how to put the two togethor to create real world efficient applications. The reader is assumed to have knowledge of .Net and XML, this is not a intro level book. The book shows how to combine .Net with XML and then reinforces it with several case studies of full applications using the techniques learned throughout the book. This one is a keeper for my book rack."
2,Too much pages and not enough content.,"I bought this book thinking that it was about XML and its applications in .NET, but I saw that it covers just how to use the class library of the framework to work with XML parser.I'm not a novice to XML, but I can say that if you don't know XML or .NET this book will be quite hard to understand, and if you know them both you will not find too much use for its contents.If you read books like Professional C# 2nd Edition and Professional ADO .NET Programming you will see a good part of the contents of this book and will learn a lot more."
2,VB or C?,VB or C which is it? I don't mind books the have syntax for both VB.net and C#. I also don't mind books that have JUST C#(since I don't know C# why would I mind this?). I Like books that have JUST VB.NET since thats what I like. But this book doesn't do any of these! It provides C# only on many occasions! And as a VB.NET only programmer its awfully hard to build on C# examples. It's almost as if the authors didn't know how to code everything in VB.NET and just skipped it sometimes.
5,Stunning and simple,"I just bought this book, and I feel confident it will be a cherished keepsake. It's hard to find a book of the Christmas story that is brief enough for the youngest children, but the lyrics to ""Silent Night"" work beautifully. The illustrations are lovely and the text is very simple and familiar, but eloquent."
3,Nice but not Jeffer's best work.,I've been looking for some excellant illustrated Xmas books and thought I would find it in this 'Silent Night' illustrated by Jeffers.I am a great admirer of Susan Jeffer's artwork but this just isn't as compelling as her other works. An 'okay' book but nothing great.
1,Too much nudity and crude language,"This game has great, action-filled play. However, the mermaids, with their fully developed, unclothed, human bodies there for all to see is basically animated pornography. The crude language throughout makes the game a complete turnoff."
1,Saving Mac for last and doing only OS 10?,"Ironic this game will play on windows 95 which is the equivalent of Mac OS 7.5 but won't run on anything less than OS 10 for a Mac. Welp, that's not enough for me to upgrade to OS 10. Guess I'd rather put the $250 in RAM and software upgrades towards a new Playstation/Xbox.Somebody is getting a kickback for that I'm sure."
4,Practical Use,"A with all the books in this series, this text presents a very clear and consise look into this tool and its uses. It will walk you through set-up, uses, migration strategies, and some common tricks and tips.If you are looking to get the tool up and running, this book is for you. If you wish to get into the real nitty-gritty mega-techy stuff, skip this book and go to the Microsoft Resource Guide.If you have no expirience working with Windows Servers and back-office packages, you will find that this book may be over your head."
4,Good book for Moon aficianados,"Book is very thorough, though sometimes a bit too technical for this reader. I bought it hoping to learn some of the terminology and patterns of the moon. It does this very well.I recommend it, though not for the casual reader."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is definetly the best heavy metal cd of 1998. The way Max Cavalera mixes all types of music, yet makes it his own, is amazing. The man is a musical genius. 5 stars is an understatement for this album. Buy it."
4,MAX has taken genius to a NEW LEVEL!!!!!,"From the opening of eye for an eye to the earth shattering prejudice, this album put me beside myself. When most bands break up and go on to ""solo"" projects, the listener is subject to an array of half thought-out mindless B.S. Not Max! Mind wrenching, and full fleged power is what every song brings! Thank you Max!"
5,A uniquely heavy album,"A good combination of tribal music, but still remains heavy. His vocal style and ability to write creative heavy music is very present in this album."
1,not for me,my kid's got this they loved it so they played it all the time when it was hot so it's for them
2,garbage,"this mixtape is garbage. this is the worst cd i own with juelz santanas name on it. in think santana is 1 best rappers out, but this cd is a garbage he has much better stuff out then this."
1,Waste of my two CD-Rs,I heard this garbage...all those beats corny as f**k...im tired of seeing these non heterosxual pink wearing f@gg0tz screaming Dipset Dipset..This s**t is garbage..i dont see nothin special about Dipset...I mean..theres other rappers that can spit 10x better than these cats or Juelz Wacktana...I dunno...if you like corny muzik...then get this album...but to me..this album is so bad that i didnt even get to my second cd (no joke)...i threw these cd-r to the trashcan cuz that were his muzik belongs to
3,Mic check over and again.,"People have waitting for song where the rapper says mic check , mic check like I waitting to have heart attack. Juelz Santana's new album is a 3 out of 5. he can do better than this cd. Hit like I'm Back."
4,"Oh, Miss Dall'Armi wasn't the first!","Great to hear a singer able (and willing) to perform this kind of music: it make the songs I knew from music sheets come alive. This performance has (with a slightly different repertoire, and a different backing) been equalled recently by Jody Dall'Armi, with the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra (CD ""On the Level, You're a Little Devil"")"
3,After the Ball,"This Cd was very enjoyable. Joan Morris' voice was clear and flexible, William Bolcom's piano was crisp .I enjoyed the musical choices- a good montage of the era."
2,"Lots of parts, not as simple as pictured!","recieved with missing parts, it was a mess, I returned it for my money back."
1,Doesn't work - TWICE,"I ordered and received the Salton cleaner and the steamer portion didn't work. Amazon was wonderful and sent a replacement immediately. The second one still doesn't work. There isn't a troubleshooting guide in the manual and when I called Salton, they could not provide any additional help."
3,Good item but they charged double shipping.,The charger works O.K. The wall charging part doesn't work but the car charger part works great(that's all I ordered it for anyway). I ordered with another charger and they charged shipping for both items($7.98) but shipped in bubble wrap envelope(worth about $.25).
5,Whatever you do - DON'T read this book!,"Do not read this book. This book just might radically alter the course of your life - it may bring you out of a complacent, quiet Christian lifestyle into an exhilerating adventure. And we wouldn't want that, right? All silliness aside, I will gladly recommend this book to any person who is truly seaching for the answer to ""What is God's will for my life?"" While this book will not give them THE ANSWER, it will help give them THE DIRECTION."
4,...FORCEFULL...,"...this man will huff and puff and blow your stuff down! radio will never play this and it is a bit conceptual, maybe like combining some of john coltrane's love supreme with some of pharoah sanders' work. it could take some getting use to by most people; i might even listen to it once every couple of months myself, but the purchase is worth it if only for bluiett's renditions of ""precious lord"" and ""wind beneath my wings"". amba hawthorne's vocals on those tracks would make mahalia jackson sit up and take notice; i wish she had contributed more. but all-n-all, this is jazz related soul music and bluiett delivers."
4,Welcome diversity of styles....,"Stylistically, the individual pieces run quite a gamut. Each song has its own persona. We have the free form playing usually expected from Mr. Bluiett, we have beat poetry, we have a kindergarten vocal group, we have straight jazz, and we have one smokin' good vocal version of ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" and so on. ""Wind Beneath.."" is recorded so intimately you think you are seated right there at the cocktail table at the foot of the stage. Hamiet submerges himself so often you think he has left the building, then, at just the right time, here comes the fogcutter!! If you are familar with this artist and know what to expect, the directional changes will go down easily and welcomingly. Like Lester Bowie's more tuneful efforts, you will find many melodies here to enjoy along with the more extreme reed excursions. And he really gets the notes down there LOWWWWWW on many occasions!!"
2,Not a good book,"I have stayed in a book store for half an hour to scanning the content of the book.However I find that the authors only explain the C# concept a little bit.The authors only spent about 350 pages to explain the concept, then they start to teach how to use Visual C# !As a result, I have bought Programming C#(2nd Edition) instead.I think this book is suitable for immediate developer.(This is my first review in Amazon, although I am one of the customers since 3 years ago.)"
5,really handy device,The One Way Multi Gauge is a very useful item to have about the shop. It can be used for all manner of things. It is very well made and easy to use. I would recommend it highly for machine set ups of all kinds.
3,"Great guage, but it's only ONE-WAY!","I have this gauge and use it to set my joiner knives. Works very well. Setting/checking heights/distances off a surface is very easy, however it is not designed to check your table saw blade to your t-slot, unless you rig up some method of doing so (does not fit in the t-slot or have a method to register to a t-slot). Also it will not measure your arbor on your table saw as other guages will. I find this gauge limited in it's uses. It does some things extremely well but lacks the ability to do others. I am now researching other gauges for checking/adjusting my table saw, drill press etc. This is a keeper for the joiner and setting blades heights, but it can't do much more than that out of the box."
3,Adequate youth sci fi novel,"Despite some formulaic material, ""The Silver Metal Lover"" is a worthy youth sci fi novel.Using the familiar themes of adolescent awkwardness, enemy-friends and an unhelpful parent, the novel tells the story of plain Jane, fabulously rich, who gives up everything when she falls in love with a robot--who is really a kind of deus-ex-machina for her establishing her freedom as a young adult.The story is colorful, with some dramatic scenes but it really is not anything more than a love story of youth set against an exotic background. Good for an evening's read, but no more."
5,A Beautiful and Enjoyable Read,"I read Tanith Lee's, Black Unicorn, years ago so when I stumbled across this on Amazon I was curious. After reading the reviews I decided to grab a copy and give it a go. A very wise move!This is a really lovely tale of a young woman and her love for Silver, a robot. I was fascinated by the world it was set in, and of course the characters who were believable and enjoyable to read. Being a sucker for romance, I of course adored the love which develops between Jane and Silver.Do yourself a favour and go and buy this one, its a keeper."
5,The Silver Metal Lover,"I read this book while I was in the hospital recovering from a serious accident. In spite of all the pain, confusion and worry, I was completely entranced and transported, inspired and deeply touched.This is a wonderfully unique book, really one of a kind, and reading it truly made me feel as if I had been to another world and back in spite of my discomfort. It takes a VERY good author to hold the attention of a person with a broken leg ! There is sadness and cruelty, but also hope, kindness, beauty and a kind of desperate longing to live life, a real life fully in the midst of all the pollution and artificiality of the strange world Ms. Lee has created. And there is love and deep personal transformation sincerely and believably depicted. This book left me absolutely haunted and very hopeful at a difficult time. Highly recommended!"
5,"Smooth and seductive, Lee sweeps the readers into her world.","This is the first Tanith Lee I've read, and now I know I have been missing something. Her characters are well developed, and their emotions are raw and pure. This is the first time a fantasy book has brought me to tears. I have a feeling that this will join the ranks of the ""well-thumbed"" on my book shelf. Read it, be it, love it!"
3,worth reading,"I enjoyed reading this book but it's not one of my favorites. It has the whole ""obsessive love at first sight"" thing that's very overdone these days. I couldn't relate at all to any of the characters. I did enjoy the book, though, because the environment was beautiful and unique. It's a nice short read."
4,It was a good read.,I will remember this book. It was fresh and light (no detailed sex scenes).It made you think about your own life and where you stand on what you believe and have been taught to believe. Silver Metal Lover also helps you to brake down friendship and (maybe) question it. The context was unexpected and sweet.
5,I book I read again and again,"I got this book when I was in junior high school. I've read it so much that the original has some taped pages. Unlike some critics, I believe that Jane is a strong role model for young women, yet realistic in her emotions and her actions. How I wished I could be Jane and own Silver. I think this started my robot fetish in fact."
4,A book every one should read,"this was a book i could in a way relate to. Its so amazeing to see Jane grow and dominate her own life beacue of a new found strength, the strength she found in her silver meatle lover!READ THIS BOOK!"
1,I will not be forgiven by those who idolize this novel,"A penpal raved about this story in the same gushing manner as most of the reviews found here. I wondered what marvel awaited me. I do not expect the fans of this text to agree with me, but I found the text so childish and the writing so poor that I actual laughed. The story seemed more like a fairytale for pent-up teenagers than a serious plot for adults. The language was so weak at other times that it was painful. Here is an example: ""People who live along the banks can open their windows on it, unlike the people who live along the banks of the polluted Old River, who have to use the filtered airconditioning even in winter."" Still, the power of the central mythic relationship and its melodramatic pathos seems more than enough compensation for those who can bear this abuse of language."
1,melodramatic and kinda lame,"Premise is great - some images and ideas are great, actual story falls very short. Jane is whiny, and the story is repetitive to a fault. I found it to be tedious in the extreme."
4,Journey to self,"Jane is a rich young woman living on an Earth remade by natural disasters. She falls in love for the first time with a robot called Silver, and feels like her life has been thrown into disarray. One of her friends, Clovis (a gay man), helps her to be with Silver, and Jane runs away from home to live with Silver in one of the worse-off areas of the city. Silver and Jane live happily for some time, with each teaching the other what it means to be human, to be living, until the company which created Silver seeks to reclaim him due to his ""flaws"". Tanith Lee's fascinating novel is the story of growing up, of becoming one's own self apart from family and friends, of developing one's own beliefs and persona. This is the type of book which gets better the longer one digests it. It's a celebration of first love, even one that ends sadly."
5,My favorite book...,"An incredible book that I have loved since it first came out. It's a perfectly told story of a girls first romance and coming of age, all with an amazing twist. Poignant. Thoughtful. Amazing. It touches me now as much as it did when I first read it as a young person. It's an indictment of the stupidity of the publishing industry that this book is currently out of print."
5,Wow,"There are three kinds of books out there in my opinion - those that make you laugh, those that make you cry, and those that leave you so stunned by their beauty that all you can say is ""Wow."" This is the rare book about which I would circle all of the above. You must read this book - it will change forever your view of life, of love, and of what it means to be human."
4,In Love With A Robot,"I all most never like romance novels. However, I very much enjoyed this book written by Tanith Lee.It's one of those few romance novels, that I go back to reading. Lee does a wonderful job writing the complications about being a robot and a girl being in love with a robot.It sounds kind of hockey at first but it's very well done and tragic in many ways.Really good for someone who wants a romance that isn't all kiss, kiss, and lets make up."
4,Metal Love,"This is one of my most favorite books. I rarely enjoy romance novels. However, there was just something intriguing about this one.I read it early high school and it's one of those books that I pick up reading once in a while.I really enjoyed the secondary plot of the homosexual liaison romance, with one of the characters.Lee does a wonderful job experiment different kinds of relationships and isn't afraid of writing different stories."
5,One of the best Tanith Lee books,"I have read most of Tanith Lee's books over the years, but I consider this one as her best. She created a story that is both haunting and beautiful that I cannot forget for years. She created a world that is bored and indifferent, and, in it, she introduced a love that cannot be extinguished. She affirmed that love is eternal and love is beautiful and love can transcend even the differences between men and machine. Comparing to a robot who can love, the human beings who feel indifference to human sufferings are much more like machines than humans."
5,Lovely story that leaves you wanting so much more.,"I waited a long time before picking this book up. I wish I hadn't! Jane's story of discovering herself is sad and yet also hopeful. You walk away from the book with a feeling that it isn't the end of the story, not by a long shot.Jane grew up the sheltered daughter of a rich woman. Her friends are not the best, but Jane tries. Attending a interview with a friend, she meets Silver, and her world is never really the same. At first Jane's disturbed by how much Silver is like a human. Then she falls in love and she does everything she can to be with him.This story is sweet and heartfelt. One of Tanith Lee's best."
5,Excellent thriller writing - way above average style -,"Probably the finest thriller about the Irish Troubles written in the last twenty years. The Daily Telegraph (London) called it 'the thriller of the year"" in 1987. Currently in its 22nd printing in the UK (Coronet Books"
2,"Much Anticipated, Sadly Disappointed!","We were really looking forward to the release of this book, only to be sadly disappointed! Instead of categorizing the items pictured by the companies who produced them, they are set up by the production year, 1930s, 1940s, 1950s, etc! There is an index in the back but it's rather confusing and who wants to spend time flipping back and forth! Definitely NOT a user friendly book. I suppose you have to take different areas of the country into consideration but I've found the prices are totally unrealistic. Makes me wonder if Mr. Chipman is wanting to sell his collection! On the plus side, the pictures are good."
4,California Pottery,"This book provides a nice overview of California pottery. Very good examples of the individual styles of the pottery makers of the 1930 - 1960. One major flaw - no Vernon wear is listed. I would also highly recommend the book, California Pottery second edition, by this same author, for an even more complete listing of CA pottery and the histories of the various pottery makers during their heyday."
5,"Vintage Pottery, Ceramics","Excellent book on many California Potteries. There are many more Pottery companies to be written about but for vintage pottery, this is the best I have seen."
3,Very cute but not worth more than $5,my 20month old wore it and it was adorable. it was a little small so the pants were like nickers. It is not high quality and seems like it's disposable.
4,Color style packs for ipaq,"Fellow amozoner's, The ipaq style packs are not bad. It all depends onthe kind of style you like. The colors match the silver buttons and the exposed unit. It is also a great feature to have a matching stylis. It stands out in a good way, it looks good and it is not depressing compared to the black style pack. The Bottom line is 1.if you want to style-get it 2.if you like your style pack that you already have-dont buy itI DO recommend it!!!!-Brandon"
1,My Foot!!!,"After waiting some 3 weeks for this product, thanks in part to one reviewer who, in fact, swayed my decision with the comments ""Two ounces of dried peppers is a pretty big bag."" I got some teeny, tiny little 3 x 5 or so zip-close bag with what looks like red pepper bits, flakes and DUST! I will NEVER make this mistake again. They even have the gall to put in the directions to ""Add 1 C. red peppers to boiling water to reconsitute - - ONE CUP???!!!??? I would guess that not even the entire bag makes 1 cup and it is CERTAINLY NOT ""a pretty big bag,"" as noted. I was expecting luscious CHUNKS of dried red pepper dices, as advertised and I got a bunch of dust and flakes for my apparently wasted money. NO MORE! Do not bother.Make your own. That's got to be a better deal. ""a pretty big bag,"" My Foot!"
3,USUAL 70S KUNG FU FILM,"A YOUNG MARTIAL ARTIST [MENG FE] WANTS REVENGE AGAINST THE MARTIAL ARTS MASTERS THAT KILLED HIS FATHER. HAS GOOD FIGHTS AS ALWAYS, BUT THE DUBBING'S BAD AND THE STORY JUST [LIKE MOST MARTIAL ARTS MOVIES FROM THIS TIME PERIOD] GETS TOO THIN. BUT, I'VE SEEN MOVIES THAT'RE 10 TIMES WORSE THAN THIS. AT LEAST IT IS WORTH A WATCH."
3,above average at best,"This is a fairly enjoyable old-school kung fu flick with a story similar to Fists of the White Lotus(guy gets repeatedly beaten by the villain until his repeated training helps him eventually to defeat his enemy). The lead is fine, but the fights are a little on the slow side, which is expected from an early 70's movie. The dvd has a nice widescreen transfer, a Casper cartoon short(don't know why either), short trivia game and dvd dictionary. Overall not a great movie or extras, but if you're a die-hard collector(and at this price with really good dvd picture quality) you might still want to pick it up.btw, the reviewer from CA a couple reviews back is obviously reviewing something else."
2,fong sai yuk,"This has a great acting performance by Mang fei and Kuratu did all he could with the direction he was under , but doees't hold up to his performances in his later years like heroes of the east, legend of a fight4er and fist of legend."
3,NOT BAD...,"This movie was pretty decent. The only drawback to this DVD was the picture quality. If you like to watch your movies full screen (or as close to as possible) and thus utilize the zoom feature on your DVD player then the picture quality becomes very substandard. If not, and you don't mind half your TV screen being black bands then the picture quality is good enough. It just seems as though it was a straight transfer from VHS to DVD!! I guess for $4.99 what else can you expect?"
1,Is this the same band?,"Wow, What the hell happened? Hed pe just changed from being a genius rock band, to a wanna be rap group. Blackout was an awesome CD, and I couldn't wait for their new release. After buying ""Only In Amerika"" I was very mad that I spent the money on it. If you guys are Hed pe fans like me, and are thinking of what to do with this album because its just so poor, you might wanna do what I did.....throw it away"
1,Hypocritical,"For a band that shouts about being uncensored, the cd is copy-protected. Been a big fan of hed for a long time but could not play this album through my ipod = a waste of a cd. Listened to the album in my car, music was good, lyrics were good in parts but def. repetitive, but again who cares if the record labels limit your ability to listen to the record. Don't purchase this record or any other records from this label if you enjoy listning to music on your computer or an ipod."
1,"2012, GONE","What is this? WHAT IS THIS? This is PE slamming as many vulgarities into a string of ""lyrics"" as possible, backed up by music that most garage bands can do better than. It tries to be hard, but comes of as vulgar crap. hedPE was a great find for me years ago, but I believe I am done with this band. What the heck are they screaming about? Every other word is a profanity.It's one thing to go 'hardcore', and reclaim your roots and all that, but this isn't hedPE. This is just crap. I don't write many reviews, unless I really love it or really hate it, and this, I really hate. Don't waste your time. And that makes me a sad panda."
5,Awesome,"Great album. I listen to it in the car, and it can put me in a good mood when I am having a bad day."
4,different but!! sounds amazing,"If you are a true HED fan you will like this album. A lot of the reviews so far don't realize how they recorded this album! BUT all the songs are upbeat and heavy. Favs are ""wake up, the box,voices,chicken!! Check this album out!!!"
4,Good...but not as good as Broke,"This album is a definate improvement over the abomination of the album Blackout but is still not on par with Broke. The tracks are good and I like the rawer sound that they have. The use of the word f*ck is very apparent in the album so if you like a little bit of cleaner music stay away,but I think the language works. Its kind of like listening to a rock version of the Geto Boys, old school Doggystyle Snoop or NWA. Overall, if you own Broke and hated Blackout then buy this. If your new to the group then get Broke first. My favorite tracks are ""Represent"", and ""the box"". Out of the 14 songs on the album (yes there is a hidden track that is awesome)3 I really couldnt stand:The truth, chicken, and Not ded yet. Other than those the CD is pretty good. Like I said, if you are sensitive to language this is problably not for you. Pick it up..its worth it."
2,what happen to the best rap-metal band,lets go back when i heard the album broke broke was the best hed album ever made by them i still listen to it now i got broke like 2 years ago i still love it but the new album is lame i got tired of this album about 2 days then i threw it in to my old cd pile just what is up with the song daydream that song is just so stupid old hed is gone now we HAVE the S**TY HED
3,It's no broke,"The self titled wasn't bad, and blackout had its high points, but broke was a definite best. If you have never bought a Hed album don't start with this one. BUY BROKE! Going into this album however, you should know that cussing is not an issue with these guys, they don't give a damn and neither do I to tell you the truth. If you want clean rap listen to Will Smith. Not the best, but not as bad as some of the other reviews make it out to be. If you're a die hard hed fan buy it, but don't get your hopes up."
1,"disgusting, offensive, unoriginal","a huge dissapointment after the first three albums. offensive lyrics, eg taking advantage of under-age girls with explicit sexual language, and other perversions. the other albums touch lightly on this subject but not as often or as foul as on this album. if i wanted to listen to this kind of trash, i'd listen to eminem. musically, it just sounds like another crappy hip-hop record. it's almost as if this is a completely different band. they need to stick to the heavier riffs and deeper lyrics-as portrayed on earlier albums-especially the third one. i don't want to feel dirty after listening to a ""rock"" cd."
1,Uh..what did you expect kids?,"Hed(PE) is a horrible group that was never good, nor talented. Just because you can write nursury rhymes and throw down beats on a drum with bass and guitar does not make you a tight group. These guys are horrible, and this album reconfirms it. Many reviewers are stating that their vocalist sounds like a whiny baby on this album. Well what did he sound like on their previous albums? He has always sounded like a baby who cannot rap or sing! He was horrid On Methods of Mayhem and horrid in Hed(PE). This band sucks and is for NU-Metal fans only(basically kids who hate their parents for some odd reason or another and just love to be overall angry at the world because they cannot face the fact that they suck).Do not buy this album. DO NOT! It is horrid beyond belief."
1,Immature and pathetic.,"First off, these guys are a joke. They ""rebel"" against the mainstream, well sorry to break it to you THEY ARE MAINSTREAM. The singer sounds like Fred Durst (NOT a compliment) the guitar work is laughable at best same goes for the drummer. How is this offensive, well unless you are offended by complete and total immaturity don't worry it won't. That leads me to another point, what IS offensive? Well, if your above the age of 12 and no longer find people saying ""f*ck"" talking about weed or getting drunk it isn't offensive. If you find this to be good, it is only because you haven't found real music yet. Don't worry you will, this will appeal to the 12-15 year old group that is it."
2,where is the old guys i used to follow around???,"i know that most girls don't like this band, but even though i am a girl, i love their music. i never find their lyrics offensive, becuase they are normally done in an absolutely hilarious and clever way. i love going to their concerts and have even met the band. i have all their albums and have listened to them for a long time and i have to say that i am disappointed in what they have boiled down to. i really think that they can do a lot better. i am upset to hear about the line-up change since i love their old music, but i can't change that. i don't know that i would buy this album. and all of you ridiculous people saying they have been fans since the beginning saying that the beginning is ""broke"", i have to tell you that there is another amazing album before that, it was self-titled and a million times better that than this."
4,Really different,"Well, I must say I despised this album when I first heard it. Its pretty degrading to women but besides that.. the songs grow on you. Its like a new style for them, and personally, I admire how they took on this edge. Yep its vulgar. Yep its obsene. But if anyone would actually listen to what they are saying they would realize that the band.. doesn't really care what anyone thinks. that is WHY this cd is so vulgar. If they cared about what other people thought than I guess they would still be making their watered down stuff eh? They are coming back, rebeling against mainstream.. and personally I find that admirable. Its not everyday you find music like that.So what if you don't like their lyrics etc. etc. Go complain to them. I'm sure they'll care. (: Not.They're saying wake up to the reality of how this world is. You want sheltered music.. look else where."
2,What Happenend???????,I really wanted to like this album but this is horrible. To begin with the lyrics go into three directions.....1.Boy do mainstream punk rock bands suck(duh!!) 2.I sure do I like p-u-s-s-y(duh!!) 3.Censorship is bad for us all(duh!!!!!!!!) The latter being the only bit of substance on the record. As far as the music goes there are a couple of highlights but so few to even mention. The songwriting is so bad it sounds like this is a band that just started playing last week........sorry guys. The mixing of the record is terrible. If you really want to get into Hed P.E. pick up their self-titled or Broke.
1,What a Joke,"Being a long time hed pe fan, I thought I would pick this album up.. What a mistake.. The guitars sound awful, the drums sound like they were recorded in a garage, and the lyrics are just downright stupid. Never before have I bought a CD and listened to just 3 songs and knew that this album was heading right for the second hand shop. The only song that was okay is Raise Hell.."
2,Want to hear f*** over and OVER,This cd has to contain the worst lyrics ever (Barney the dinosaur songs make more sense). I've been a huge fan of hed for 4-5 years and was so juiced for this cd. Maybe they will put out an instrumental version because the music is great but the lyrics are horrible. I dont know what they were thinking. Freedom not always the best I guess.The 2 stars are for the music only - music actually would get 5 - lyrics are that bad.
1,"Broke was great, this is Broke Ass","I have been listening to hed pe for a long time and have even seen them live. I USED to be a huge fan. This is the worst cd I have bought in years. It's the most negative uninventive piece of garbage on the market right now. If you like/can relate to this cd, you are an idiot. Hed needs to leave planet earth after this disaster."
1,Are you kidding me???,"Long time hed fans will love this album??? Bridges the gap??? Give me a break. I've been following this band since the EP came out almost 10 years ago and in my humble opinion, this album is terrible. The production is horrible, the guitars are tinny and thin, and the drums sound like they were using ice cream buckets. It's no surprise to me that Chad and Wes bailed out of this band before the embarrassment of this release.If you're looking for an introduction to what ""used"" to be an amazing band, buy Broke instead. This album is a waste of money."
5,"Not what I expected, but great...","I have liked hed pe since 1997 and had very high hopes for this new album. Upon the first few listens, I immediately didn't like the new drummer and felt the songwriting was not as good as their previous efforts...so I put the cd aside for a few months. A few weeks ago I pulled it back out and it's been in my cd player almost exclusively for weeks. This album may take some time to grow on you, it is definitely written differently than other hed pe records...but it's still brilliant. You can tell Jahred spent a lot of time on the lyric and vocal hooks...the vox are what makes this album work. Highlight tracks are ""Raise Hell"", ""Represent"" and ""Chicken"""
3,Ouch!!,"The intro 'Foreplay' sets you up completely for this cd...""Get the kids outta the room"". Some songs on this cd have more swear words than not...didn't know you could make an entire sentence from swear words, but yes...you can. This cd is some what of a novelty...a guilty pleasure I guess.My personal favorites are 'Raise Hell', 'Wake Up' and 'War'...the heavier, closer to metal tracks. I find 'Represent' comical and catchy...how much talent is involved, however...not much.This cd comes off to me as angry and spiteful. If you can hear it for free, give it a listen, but I would not pay for it."
1,I agree with George..,Boy oh boy. What the hell happened HED? Keep your day jobs cause with an album like this you're going no where. I feel embarrassed to listen to this album in my car with the windows down for the pathetic and vulgar lyrics. It's too bad you didn't write more songs when you wrote Broke and put an album together now that had those songs on it. This c.d. is just pure crap.
5,Gimmie Hed,One of if not THE best album Hedpe has ever released. If you dont have this album you dont know what sick music is!
5,emo killers,"hed pe is back on the radio with there single renegade from new album n.W.o. they have won people's choice 2 nights in a row taking the title from shinedown whom won for two weeks straight, then they put papa roach song state of emergancy against hed, n hed whoop'd em bad too! and oh did i mention its a emo alternative station??? 89x in detroit windsor area?!?!?!? so back to only in amerika they prove they can do what they want when they want!!!! so all of the 1 star and 2 star review's go listen to f*ck'n ""fall out f*g""!!! cause hed pe isnt over produced garbage like the crap that ther taking out on the peoples choice!!!!!!HED PE WHAT!!! HED PE WHAT!!! B2R D4L"
1,If I could give a zero star rating I would,"I wasn't that familiar with Hed PE till ' Blackout'.......LOVED IT......... then I bought 'Broke' and that one rocked. I disregarded all the negative reviews and bought 'Only In Amerika' anyway.........my mistake. If you like childish vulgarity non-stop, this cd is for you., otherwise stay away."
4,Why the poor reviews?!?,"I've been a hed pe fan for years and have loved their discs ... they're also one of the best live bands I've seen.This latest disc isn't their best, but, IMO, it's better than the panning it's receiving from ""fans"". C'mon, people, do you really want them to keep re-issuing their first disc? This latest efforts shows a growth and maturity in their writing. Give it another listen."
1,Amazingly immature.,"Broke was Hed's greatest album, they then dropped a notch with Blackout, but it was still worth buying in my opinion, and it had some very memoriable songs (ie. Other Side). So WTF is with this CD? I wanna know. It doesn't hold up to anything they prepared most of their fans for. If you like Limp Bizkit (like others have said) you'll like this album, but if you like Broke and Blackout, there is a good chance you won't like this album. The lyrics are immature and uninspiring for even the youngest rapper/rocker. It just seems as though they didn't care what they were doing this time."
2,What happen here?,"Alright, these guys have the potential of releasing some excellent pieces of work, i.e. Broke, Blackout. Both of those albums are unforgettable. Then came Only in Amerika. It's just laced with bad music and childish and vulger lyrics. I don't know if they're tryin to shock someone or create controversy or what. But what I do know is that I'm sure they lost a lot of fans on this one."
1,Does not work,I tried to charge this battery several times and it just does not work? My old battery does charge so it is not the charger.
2,Cheap but not very good,"Good: Cheap and delivered quickly.Bad: Does not last as long as the original equipment battery, fewer shots. Also has a higher self discharge than the original battery. The battery must be charged each time before you want to use it."
4,A fair battery,"I purchased this battery to use with my Canon Power Shot S500. The orginal battery no longer holds charge so need to find a replacement (almost 5 years). I don't plan on buying a new digital camera since there's nothing wrong with it, just need a new battery.Upon receiving this battery I charged it with the Canon charger, no problem. However, when I place it in the battery compartment in my S500, the stopper wouldn't hold the battery in place, as if like the battery is a bit big (long) to fit the compartment (though it is the exact same size as the orginal). I did mangaged to shut it and take pictures with my camera.I charged it once and took pictures with it on 3 days worth of use, still no need to charge yet. Eventually, I will purchase a newer digital camera but this an easy and CHEAP fix."
3,"Good breadth, bad depth on Java Web Services","This is a good book to familiarizing on how to implement web services using Java. What I found most valuable about this book is the coverage of AXIS, CapeStudio, SAP and J2EE.As most other Web Services books, the chapters on SOAP, WSDL, UDDI and Web Services Security are very general and take up half of the book. If you're already familiar with these concepts these chapters are useless. Also as most web services related technologies are quickly evolving I would find this book quite outdated today."
3,Very few Examples mostly theory,I have read more than half of this book. The concepts covered are helpful but the example are useless. I like Developiong ASP Component by S. Powers better for examples.
2,Too much fluff,"The authors waste too much time on COM/MTS/Threading Models/ATL about which many books have already been written (many from WROX itself). It lists Alex Homer as one of the authors but i doubt he wrote anything for this book. (I was expecting excellent treatment of the subject more along the lines of ""Professional MTS and MSMQ Programming with VB and ASP"" by Alex Homer). The book could have been less than half its current size (and probably cost less) had the authors concentrated solely on ASP and Components for ASP."
2,Code Problem,"There is a problem with some of the code examples in Chapter 7. There are some minor dicrepancy in the some of the earlier code. I went back and checked the code in 7 again and the download code will not work and the code described would have to be modified in order to work. I consider this an egregious error on the part of the publisher and authors, especially since they've had more than 2 years to correct the mistake. I did find some of the information in some of the other chapters useful, but when sections are this bad, I begin to question everything else. I also examined wrox web site and found it humourous that the only errata given for a 2 year old book is only 8 days old."
1,Look else where,"I am sure this is a good book, but I have had a couple of questions that I cant find the answers to. The book is recently published so the only people who can answer the questions are the authors. They dont seem to be to interested. I'll start reading the book again, when my questions are answered by the authors. Until then the book consists of pretty useless information."
2,code does not work,"I was hoping their examples would be useful. theory is not bad, however, I could not get the example code working. I even downloaded code from wrox site and it still would not work. i wonder what their project manager was thinking. did anyone ever think of testing code?"
4,a Good Intro,"when this came out on Disc this was cool as a First Overview for a Greatest Hits COmpilation.it was a cool intro then as now.""FlashLight"",""Chocolate City"",""Up FOr The Down Stroke"",etc...for a Casual P-Funk Fan or New Fan this is a Cool Place to Ride on The MotherShip.but when you want more the Journey is Endless."
2,Not that fun,"We played with a group of close friends (mid 30s). The game was not that fun. The phrases you were trying to get your team mates to guess were often too specific. It provided a few laughs, but overall was not worth it. We threw it away as we were packing the car to leave the beach. I wouldn't recommend this game. We have enjoyed Time's Up in the past."
1,Very Disappointed,"I hate to rain on anyone's parade but I just received my LaCie 250GB drive today.... I was excited to receive it but extremely disappointed when I started reading the manual and saw that you can only format this drive in FAT32 format. The main problem with FAT32 is that files are limited to 4GB in size. If you format the drive to anything else, it becomes a read-only drive. This is a huge problem for me, I wanted this drive to store video files between multiple machines on my network. My video files are routinely larger than 4GB so unfortunately I have to box it back up and ship it back. What a waste of time, I wish they stated this extremely important restriction online where people could see it. Now I know why this drive is priced so cheap."
3,Invisible file proble,"This disk is OK except for one big thing, and I'm not the only user who has had this happen: if I drag a file from my Mac to the disk it appears OK in the disk's finder window. However, if I save a file from within it's application, the file does not appear in the disk's finder window. The file is there, and can be opened by it's host application using the 'open' dialogue box, but it cannot be seen in the finder, now overwritten by dragging an identically named file from my Mac to the disk. Big problem."
5,Amazing,"I've never heard such range before, variety of singing and songwriting styles. Bella Rocks like Joplin, and sings ballads like no other.I was lucky enought to catch her show at The House Of Blues a few weeks ago. What a great performance!Can't wait for part two.Dave Rand"
2,value brand,If you have ever bought value bran potato flakes you will see the similar taste. These were not worth the money.
3,"ok, but could have been better","The dvd was fun to watch, however as for being any help on tips for being a better bowler it was ok. Walter ray bowled five different bowlers and there really wasn't any great tips for bowling on this dvd. for most part it was just walter ray and another bowler competeing against each other. if your going to pick this dvd up just to watch the bowling, then it is a interesting dvd. but I wouldn't purchase it if your looking for alot of bowling tips."
1,Died in the first trip,"It has many great features, but the quality is very bad. During our first trip, after hours contineous playing, it at first gave white screen, and then won't read any disks. I could not find any manufacture warranty on it and could not find any useful information on their website! Not recommended!"
1,Failed on second trip,"The first trip was fine although the battery life was a little short (barely enough for one 120 minute movie). However, on the second trip (a little over 30 days later) the player will reset after 20-30 minutes of playback. Would not recommend."
5,Best of all Site Server books,"This Wrox book is on of the most comprehensive works on Site Server. It's a great companion to Site Server membership and personalization (Wrox as well). This book gives you detailed views of code samples sites and importantly (which no other book or MS documentation does) gives you an architecture view of the asp, COM objects, the pipeline and IIS. The book covers both the Knowledge Management edition and Commerce Edition of Site Server. The case study in chapter 23 is very good and as usual Wrox has the source code on their site you can down load. If you get this book don't get Site Server Commerce edition 3.0 also from Wrox, you wont need it!"
3,"So So True, So So Sad","This movie actually hits base for alot of girls. Girls can be so dumb sometimes when they think they have to find a man to make them happy. Thank God, most girls end up OK and have successful marriages but the things they do when young is sad. I liked the movie, mostly because of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis. They make the movie."
5,excellent character study movie,great movie that disects the personalities of the stars. A study of 3 people that have some real serious emotional issues. Two of them know it and the third doesnt.
4,"I love this movie, that's why I had to own it!","I like the story, the music, the actors...I thought the story was bittersweet or maybe kind of sad, the guy didn't show up for the dinner, how rude of him."
5,Great story & performances,"I saw this HBO original movie when it premiered a few months ago. It is simply fantastic. Yes, I have my home taped copy, but I will be ordering this DVD. The cast is consistent in its brillance. Mira Nair has captured real life. Much respect to her!"
4,Just great,If you grew up in the 80s and want a little nostalgia this movie is it.The girls in this story makes you feel ashmed to be watching them they are so out of touch with anybody else in this world.We all know people like this and wonder how they keep existing.The acting is excellant.The story gets a little slow at times but you won't be able to stop watching.
3,Downer,"While Ms Lewis and Ms. Thurman are both fantastic, I didn't enjoy the film. Simply too depressing, and I just did not see the point.The girls did not even look very good in their eighties get-ups."
3,Easy to read,"I was probably expecting something different when I purchased this book, so it wasn't as enjoyable as I'd hoped. However, others may enjoy it more."
5,Worth the challenge,"This is a wonderful piece that is beautifully transcribed and professionally printed/presented. The pianist must have advanced technique and good reach to perform this piece. In addition, the rapidly repeated notes within crossed-handed playing positions make for a true challenge.Once you have this one mastered, you'll be asked to perform it every time your ""fans"" visit. It's a spectacular performance piece that lets the pianist traverse the entire keyboard and produce magical sounds with wide ranging expressiveness.Gershwin was a genius."
2,S Cam Air Tool,"The tool is over priced for what it does. I also check other websites and found the item considerably cheaper. In my opinion, for what this items does, I wouldn't buy it. Seller shipped item promptly so I have no problem with them."
1,I Couldn't Resist,"Two pages. $5.95 just to tell us the academy has been around for two years? Come on, get real. Gives digital publishing a bad name."
1,not real great,"The quality and selection of the illustrations is sub par. Getting both a cd -rom and a book is nice, but there are not a lot of drawings and they are, mostly, very simplistic."
4,Subtle Orange flavor,"I could have wished for a bit more orange flavor. Other than that the coffee has a fresh aroma and no bitterness. Serve this with pancakes, or after dinner."
2,"Great lullaby for kids, they fall asleep right away!!!",This book is really boring. Nothing really happens in the book.
1,the dullest book i've ever read!!!,The golden Goblet is a terrible book. i don't like it because it is a very stupid story line. if i couild rate it o stars i would do it in a second! i don't think you should read the gloden goblet.
1,BORING,"If I could, I would rate this book with zero stars because it was really boring and had no excitement at all. It wasn't even funny and Eloise Jarvis McGraw must have been insane if she thought that kids would actually waste their time to read it. I was forced to read this in sixth grade (i'm in sixth grade now) because we were studying ancient Egypt earlier. It was very dull and I actually finished it! I was so suprised. If you want to punish your kid, go out and buy them the Golden Goblet!"
1,aHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!,"scary book, weird things will come out of your closet if you read this book. It is so dull it made me scream. The main caracter ronofer is an anorexic boy who likes to tell u all his problems. His brother beats him up and he only has 2 friends who happen to both be speacial. 1 cant talk. If you want a depresing book u got it.it will make your hart crush. tears."
1,most boring and pointless book I've ever read,"Taking place ancient Egypt, this young adult novel concerns a young boy, Ranofer, who longs to be a goldsmith. His older half-brother is a tomb robber. This incredibly slow-moving, predictable, and clumsily written (far-advanced vocabulary for the age group, and full of dated language), is mind-numbingly boring, with flat, two-dimensional characters and a standard, uninteresting, predictable, didactic plot. An incredibly weak historical novel for young readers that has little to offer them, particularly in our contemporary literate world that produces so much brilliant, engaging, and deep young adult literature that even rivals adult literature. Grade: D"
2,This was not that great of a book.,"The Golden Gobletby Eloise Jarvis McGraw This was not that great of a book. It started out fairly boring and got significantly better later. This would have been a better book if it got more exciting in the beginning. We read this for our social studies class and I doubt I would have finished the book if it wasn't assigned as homework. It only became exciting when we were three quarters of the way done. Even as we got closer to the end it wasn't all that great. Over all I would say this was a really bad book, so don't go reccomending it to all your friends right away."
5,The Golden Goblet review by Matthew,"This book is based in Thebes,Egypt. A boy named Ranofer is left with his half brother Gubu afdter his father dies. Ranofer works at Rek's goldshop untill his brother realizes that he has figured out Ranofers starting to realize that he's stealing gold!Ranofer returns home one night to be told to go to the stonecutter's shop tommarrow morning. After working at his brother's shop for a while Ranofer finds a golden goblet in his brothers room. I'm not telling you anymore or I'll spoil the book. To find out what happens buy the book!"
5,My favorite book!,"The Golden Goblet is an amazing tale of a small boy, Ranofer, in Egypt. His dreams are torn apart after his father dies, as he is forced to live with Gebu, his evil half-brother. He later discovers that Gebu is a criminal! What will Ranofer do?"
2,"Sorry to Say, but......","Well, I noticed a lot of people loved this book but i sure didn't. We had to read it for a class project and nobody really liked it at all. It did get a little better towards the end but I dont think that the ending fit the book. Well, the story line of the book is slow and it doesnt grab your attention. If it wasnt mandatory for us to read this book... I would have dropped it after the first couple chapters. Maybe this book just wasnt my type of book but most people i have talked to that read this book agree with me. This book, is however, somewhat informative about Ancient Egypt, but is still very dull and boring. Personally, I think that rating this book 2 stars is pushing it and I wouldnt recomend this novel at all."
3,"It was okay, but i dont think that i would read it again","I thought that this book was okay. It tells the story of a young Egyptian boy, Raneofer, who dreams of becoming an apprentice but has know chance. In the begining it was boring, but towards the end it got better It kinda gets exciting when he starts spying on his half bother, Gebu, and finds out what he is really about and is out to stop him."
3,Golden Goblet Exerpt,"The Golden Goblet is about an Egyptian boy named Ranofer. After hid father, Thutra dies he has to live with his child-abusing half brother Gebu. Gebu always beat him up for no reason and feed Ranofer very little. Ranofer's dream was to be a Master Goldsmith, but Gebu messes it up when he makes Ranofer a Stonecutter. Soon Ranofer suspects Gebu is stealing. So, his friends, Heqet and the Ancient start spying on Gebu. But If you want to knows what happens then read Golden Goblet! If start getting bored between Chapter 1 through 2, then keep going because in Chapter 3 things start to get a little exciting. But if you are still bored then have fun burning the book."
3,ummmmm.....,"well, i am forced to read this for school (6th grade) and the beginnig was horrible and boring! but now, i am literally almost finished and it is now exciting. the book is o.k. but not great. i would definatley not pick this book to read in my own time, i just have to if i want a good grade... so ya."
1,Rock-a-buy-baaby,The Golden Goblet! This book puts sleeping pills out of of business. Its great for putting kids to sleep. It realy works!WOW! Now for only $6.29 you can get yours today! FABULOUS
1,should be distributed in prisons,"I had to read this thing in fifth grade. Still i am yet to recover. Reading the Golden goblet could easily compare to sticking rusty nails in your corneas for like, 150 pages. Those poor little'uns. I'm about 4 years past that now, so yeah, my opinion isin't fresh off the press but i can garantee, there's something wrong with this one. I had to make my dad read it to me, it hurt so much, and he hates it just as much, it's crazy. Becase he""s all in tune with lengthy literature and stomachs all of these big long historical bores for breakfast and stuff. Hates this book.I think we should burn them like we did with the Da Vinci code and let the future peoples of America read Holes instead. We would have a better world."
1,THIS BOOK IS PAINFUL TO READ!!,"This book is the worst book ever. I didn't know there could possibly be a book this bad. If you are required to read this book like me, i feel bad for you. Do NOT read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book. It is painful to read. If you are STILL thinking of reading this bad book, DON'T READ IT!! take my advice."
4,Golden Goblet,This was a good book full of adventure. At first it was boring but it got interesting near the middle of the story.
3,"This book was nicely written, but was slow-paced.","GOLDEN GOBLET REVIEW I gave this book a six I liked it because some parts were very thrilling and exciting . I also liked it because thought it was interesting to learn about another culture. I think the author could of improved the story by not being so descriptive; for example in the begining when Ranofer is pouring gold into the ingot. In a way, I think that the author could be less descriptive in this part otherwise the reader gets bored. Although in a way I like all the detail because it makes you feel like you were actually there. I also think the author could of improved the story by getting to the main plot quicker. I think this book was nicely written and very exciting but could be a faster pace."
3,I think the Golden Goblet was a very slow moving book.,"I think the Golden Goblet was a very slow moving book. It tookme twohundred pages to get into the book. There was too much detail. When there is some adventure, it is a little boring. I think the author should have been a little less descriptive. This is a sentence from the book that I thought was to descriptive: ""The stream of molten gold flowed smoothly from the crucible, reflecting in its surface the cloudless blue of the Egyptian sky"". I think the author should have put a little less words per sentence and shorten his ideas a little bit. ________________"
3,"Overall, the book was good.","I thought the book was just O.K. because it was todescriptive. Most ofthe story was description. Also the main plot happened when you were 3\4 done. With a plot like that if I wasn^Rt reading it in class would have put it down. Usually the main plot starts in the middle of a book. But there are some good parts in the book, too. Once the main plot started the book got very exciting. When that started happening I couldn^Rt put the book down. I think the author did a good job keeping people on the edge when it got really exciting. It was like at the end of each chapter you couldn^Rt tell what was going to happen next. The author also did a really good job at the end of each chapter to keep you on the edge. Over all I think the book was pretty good. But when the main plot started then I thought the book was great!"
2,Nick's Review,it is is a so-so book about a boy who lives with his half brother gebu who is very mean to ranofer. then he finds out that his brother is stealing.thats all I'm aloud to say.
3,excellent research but drags,"The Golden Goblet is an excellent piece of historical fiction and would have been a great cross curricular whole group read for 6th grade history; however, I feel the book could have been 50-75 pages shorter and still have achieved its goal. I might consider it for a summer reading list, but overall, I would have to say I was in a hurry to finish the book so I could move on to something else."
2,Great story ruined by hard vocabulary and fluency!!!!,"This book was not *fun* to read. When you are ready to relax going in to bed, you want to be able to read with enjoyment. Because of too many characters you cannot really concentrate on the plot but more on ""What is going on?"" Because the story is very full of excitement, I was able to stay awake. Ranofer was a very special character and I appreciate that."
5,Awesome book!,"It was really exciting. I loved the part when he went into the tomb. Hequet was really funny. I liked how he cheered up Ranofer all the time. All in all, it was an awesome book!"
3,Too muchn detail of Egypt but it's still exciting!,"This book had lots of detail on Egypt but I think too much! The first chapters were boring, I think my teacher just made us read it because we were studying Egypt. The last chapters were exciting, but I would read it if I was interested in Egypt!"
3,cool goblet!!!!!,"The book THE GOLDEN GOBLET is an great book for kids. It is about an orphan boy named Ranofer. After his mother and father die, Ranofer is forced to live with his half-brother, Gebu. Ranofer labors at the gold smiths shop and comes home every day to find a half-loaf of bread. Ranofer finds out Gebu is stealing gold, and with the help of his two friends, Heqet and the ""Ancient,"" they try to stopped him. The big theme in the story is family. Throughout the whole book, Heqet and Ancient are becoming Ranofer's family. Ranofer learns to trust in them for help and encoraging. I would give this book 3 stars. It's fun, but a little boring in the beginning. Read the book, and you will see what I mean."
3,Sheep in Haters Clothing?,"Moving, manipulative, food for thought, a bit scattered - all true. The one comment I am still waiting to read is for someone, anyone, to stop blaming LDS and Christianity in general for the outcome of the election, and to acknowledge that the voters of California willingly pushed the ""for"" button on this issue. No Prophet or Priest was in the voting booth with the 54 percent when they made their choice. Yes, churches vigorously promoted their agenda, as did all groups with a vested interest in this issue. The premise that one must believe 54 percent of the voters of California are too weak or simple-minded to resist the Rasputin-like powers of the LDS marketing campaign is insulting. Please, I give people more credit than that. This is a huge change in mind-set for many people, and it will take time. It doesn't make them all ""haters."""
4,Documentary About the Death of Gay Rights in California,"This film documents the way the Mormon Church pushed through California Proposition 8, which denied gays the right to marry. It seems as egregious a violation of the separation of church and state as any I have ever heard about. And apparently the IRS thinks so, too, as it launched an investigation after the election into whether the LDS should lose their tax exempt status.Some of the stories of gay Mormons being abused are pretty horrible, but it's a story that needs to be told."
1,unwatchable,"the reason there is no trailer is because this movie is horrible. the acting is bad, the filming is bad, it is the worst movie ever"
3,Overrated,"""Gap Band IV"" contains four unimpeachable classics such as""Early In the Morning"",""Outstanding"",You Dropped A Bomb On Me"" and the P-funk inspired ""Talkin Back"".But nothing else here is even half as interesting from a funk standpoint making this albumby far the most overrated item in their catalog."
4,I was pleased...,"Perhaps my expectations weren't as atmospheric as some, but I really enjoy this DVD and watch it all the time. I put the HD side through my 42 inch plasma and it looks and sounds magnificent. Some of the scenes were so vibrant and colorful it seemed unreal. Of course it wasn't all spectatcular but there was enough to satisfy me. I agree Planet Earth on HD is a better DVD (set), but it is also a different one. It is geared toward education and has a lot animals scenes. Nature's colors is for relaxing - lovely music accompaniement. Perfect for puttering around the house or sitting with a drink chatting to friends. I recommend!"
2,The Production Quality is Lacking,"The content is fine, not overly impressive, but good enough to enjoy. What I found to be the problem was the basic video and audio quality. I watched the HD-DVD version on a good quality home threater system. I'm not sure all the video was filmed in HD and a couple of the songs had quality problems with the audio. No, the DVD disk was not damaged."
2,ordinary sound track with less impressive picture quality,"The orchestra is average with rather ordinary classic music. The picture frames and colors are not that impressive. I was expecting something better with picture quality as a HD DVD title. If you are looking for something visually stunning, consider BBC's Planet Earth HD DVD."
3,Informative,"Not his best work, but an informative book all the same. I think I have read every book written by Greg Child and stronly recommend all of his books. This one was more of a technical manual and perhaps I had become to expect his writing style that you will find in all of his other works. Great author."
1,A joke. An utter joke.,"Frankly put, this book provides no detail about realistic customer service. As someone who has actually worked retail in my life, I can tell you... This book only encourages a sense of entitlement among those who read it. It's an instruction manual for those who wish to whine, cry, yell, scream, abuse employees and in general throw a tantrum to get what they want.I've always been taught to treat others how you wish to be treated. From experience, being kind, respectful, and understanding is far more likely to get rules bent for you as well as have staff actually enjoy and look forward to your presence. There's a saying: You're more likely to catch flies with honey than vinegar. This book promotes only vinegar.Not worth the pages it's printed on."
4,Fun card game if you like word games,"My wife's sister had this card game and she really enjoyed it. I don't like word games that much. It's very hard to find, only found it on line."
5,From the Manufacturer,Tri-Virsity is a 2003 Teachers' Choice Award Winner and a 2002 National Parenting Center Seal of Approval award recipient.
1,"Not a classic, but it's good.","My orginal review was not that good, I basically blasted the book, however I was discussing vampire fiction the other day and realized this was one of those books I was talking about. So it can't be all that bad!"
3,"Beautiful to look at, uncomfortable to wear","Unless you are blessed with slender, narrow feet, this beautiful DOnald Pliner sandal will likely cause a great deal of discomfort. How I wish that I had those slender and narrow feet!"
5,Best gundam battle of this seareis and every other,The battle of solomon is the most epic gundam battle ive ever seen with the federation bringing a huge fleet (including genral teinims 2nd fleet and ofcouurse the white base) this is so cool to watch beacase the battle to take solomon is long 3 eps at first the federation starts to gain the upper hand untill the BIGZAM starts to destroy gms and balls like toys then it comes out and takes out 15plus ships in one blast but it is beaten by the gundam and slegar (who dies) after that fighting still rages but the soler sytem weapon is aimed at solomon and the fortress finaaly falls highly recomended
2,A mishmash of information,"I really don't wish to offend the author of this book, but this is really lacking so far as history books are concerned. It is a hodgepodge of dates, names and pieces of information but that does not a history book make. And on one of the last pages there is mention of Chief Colorow being alive in 1925. So far as I know, he died in 1888. And the book title is misleading. If the book was condensed to include only that information about Chief Ouray, it would be a pamphlet, maybe not even a dozen pages. The book is 210 pages but heavily padded with images. Perhaps there isn't too much information on Ouray, but if that's the case, this is still poorly written and a mishmash of details. And that's the way I see it."
3,Preaching to the choir....,"The idea behind this book is sound: form bonds of love within your family by making traditions a greater part of your life. If we were just starting out raising our children, it would have been a very helpful and insightful book. The reality of it is, we have been doing this for years."
4,mark twain sam australia WA Perth,"This is a good film for the first couple of times but then seems a bit boring but I just watch it for the fight scenes. This story is about British Royal Marine Eric 'Hawk' Kelly (Gary Daniels) who is out to get answers and draw blood when he arrives in New York to investigate his step brothers brutal murder. With the help of streetwise detective Lizzie Hampton, Hawk uncovers the most lucrative of black market plots - the theft and sale of human organs! Hawk meets exotic blade and stickfighting artist Garr (Cass Magda) who is the one responsible for his brother's death."
3,Mostly Happy,There is some misinformation in this book as to location of some of the electronics in the Saturn but informative .
3,Not specific enough for some repairs,"Purchased this elsewhere. On a few pages, the print is too light to decipher. Model differences are not always indicated, which can be somewhat misleading."
4,good stuff,I would rate 4.5 if i could but i will round down for this reason I was not expecting this product to be on back order.when the product was sent it arrived on time. thanks for the great customer service in resolving the back order issue.
5,FIST CITY!,"What can I say, this album rocks. Not very often does a band release an album where basically every song is an anthem. From the first song all the way to the last. I sing along to every word with a fist in the air. This album is one of my altime favorites and will be for a long long time to come. Fist City will burn tonight!"
5,(Rancid+Social Distortion)=Sixer,"Anxious for the new Rancid album? If you just can't wait until the next release of the legendary 4 piece punk band, check out sixer. A mix of Rancid sounding vocals and guitar, mixed with social distortionesque rythym and bass, makes for one of the best new bands to come out in a while. With the wave of emo bands that have come out recently Sixer is a step in the right direction for the new punk bands out there. Sounding similar to such legendary bands as Social Distorition, Rancid, and Stiff Little Fingers, this band hailing from alabama is one of the more talented ive heard. Basically if you like punk rock music, you should check these guys out, they are hard, fast, and have some really solid lyrics."
3,New Guys On The Block,"It so happened that i heard some talk about this band around town,some 11 months ago.And it's just like me to forget things,so i never checked'Sixer'.Anyway,I run into this cd here,and i give it a listen...the vocals are excellent and the production sound is also excellent. After two songs,I feel like the guy singing is kinned to Rancid. The music work doesn't sound like Rancid at all, but the lead vocalist.. I bet is a huge fan of Rancid, and has mirrored a style very similar to his influence. The problem is that when you hear this record(like I did for the first time), you immediately tell yourself that you have heard this before,somewhere else,a different time. .I still like this release nonetheless. i gave it'3'stars."
5,Motorhead,This is one of the best Motorhead Albums I have ever heard. Having it is a must for any Motorhead fan.
4,Solid rock,"A very good album :3twin guitar attack that is influential to so many bands (Maiden, Priest, etc.)"
5,"Thin Lizzy, an underappreciated seminal band","So well produced and engineered that it still sounds good on today's stereo gear. Early and influential ""two guitars in unison"" playing, much like Lynyrd Skynyrd, but no doubt this is rock, not country rock."
4,classic,"this is music that I grew up with and I haven't forgotten it, I still love to listen to this music, it brings back memories both good and bad"
4,Great Music,"I remember this album coming out when I was a kid. At the time ""Jailbreak"" and ""The Boy's are Back In Town"" were the only songs I remember getting airplay. There are quite a few good songs on this album other than the obvious two I already stated. I highly recommend it."
5,Breakout!!!,"The cover depicts the band as some cartoon renegades escaping from some 'Orwellian' future world. Fortunately, the music goes a lot deeper! This is first rate storytelling with killer guitar harmonies. It can be bombastic and subtle (sometimes within the same song). Start with this one if you're just starting to discover Thin Lizzy."
5,A classic from the rockers,"1976 was a hot summer in England, and I was only 12 years old, this Thin Lizzy vintage would'nt reach my ears for another five years.And then WOWI won't bore you with a tedious track by track breakdown, every one is a classic, the band at its peak on tour, on fire, the duelling lead guitars of messrs Robertson and Gorham are really so exciting, laid on the intricate (and much underrated bass playing of Mr Lynott).So I guess I should buy this on CD, I still have the magnificent Gatefold LP, up in my parents attic, it would be worth something but its worn out, really.""ah nostalgia's not what it used to be....................."""
5,Exceptional Song Writing and Cohensive Playing,"This is one of my favorite albums. Not because of ""The Boys are Back in Town"" or ""The Cowboy Song"" which are fine tunes but for the the cohesiveness of the entire album. Songs flow together well and Gorham & Robertson guitar playing is the finest example of harmony playing around. Please note, this is not the best effort by Thin Lizzy - for that listen to the 1979 release ""Black Rose""."
5,The boys are back in town and its their best CD,"Buy this. its sweet. the best songs are boys r back in town and jailbreak. also to that idiot that said thin lizzy copies the darkness, guess what, thin lizzy came way before the darkness and the darkness is just a loser with a high voice who cant play anything on his guitar but solos and he copies AC/DC and Queen. Any one who likes the darkness so listen to real classic rock instead of getting the crappy imitaion version."
3,thin lizzy jailbreak,"im looking for a certain song it was""nt avalible for sampling i think its the cowboy song but what i heard i liked i""ll probably buy it right now thou im going to listen to another album."
5,It's a lot better than two stars!!!!,"I have to disagree with the last review of Thin Lizzy's ""Jailbreak"". I do agree that it's not their best work. ""I think ""Roisin Dubh (Black Rose: A Rock Legend)"" holds that title. Nevertheless, the gems on ""Jailbreak"" are certainly NOT characteristic of the music of the mid '70's, with the possible exception of ""The Boys Are Back In Town"". Let's face it- ANY band would kill to have a song like that, even if it's labeled commercial. Only Thin Lizzy could pull such a diverse collection of tunes into a cohesive effort. Yes, ""Thunder And Lightning"" is great, but it came 7 yrs. later. This is a must have disc!"
1,***SAVE YOUR MONEY***,"This book has an awful presentation of Probability in that it is way too brief. It hurts to read through this book. This book reads like it was put together in a weeks time. It is riddled with errors, some unforgivable. In short - SAVE YOUR MONEY. Stark and Woods is better, but not that great by any means. Is there a GREAT book out there on this subject?"
4,Great DVDs order another gift set!,"As always, Baby Einstein was awsome. But you would probably do better ordering a better gift set. The DVDs in this set aren't all grouped together by age. The others are a little more expensive but are all from the same age group."
5,good,"Great Product,came shrinkwrapped with no cuts or smudges on the disks.My kid loves to watch baby einstein keeps hime entertained for long periods of time. and definetly helps him learn"
4,The whole Baby series,"My boys ages 1 and 3 enjoy the whole series, and if kids are going to watch TV it's not a bad way to go. The video is amateur by today's standards, but music selection is nice. If you don't like classical music, you may find it annoying (but much less than barney or teletubes). Kids either like it or don't, so maybe try one to start. Baby Mozart is best and we like Baby Doolittle World Animals. Check out the Brainy Baby series of videos and Baby's First Impressions. They are stellar."
3,Not bad,"Excellent delivery time and condition.The DVDs are good. Colors are vivid and attracting my 1.5 years old son. But my wife didn't like the fact that it does not have any commentary with the images displayed. So, it's just stimulating vision but not associating hearing (language) with images."
2,Yeah right,"Please, these tapes are mediocore at best. A few of the tapes are better than the others but it is a big disappointment. Beyond that, I cannot stand the precotious Julie Clark and putting her kids in the tapes....boo hiss.Overall you can save yourself money if you have a video camera and classical music. Just film your kids and their favorite toys with the music in the background and Voila, there you go.....you have Baby Einstein."
2,"Baby Einstein, Vol 1 (Einstein, Bach, Newton, Shakespeare)","Can you say [bad]? I wouldn't be surprised if these ""educational"" videos actually induce limited attention span and disjointed thought processes: The presentation of images and toys is almost psychotically disorganized. Our 3-month old shows more interest in watching ""Win Ben Stein's Money"". We'll try again when he's a bit older - I'm just giving you the adult take."
4,"Mostly good, if used correctly.....","We have all of these videos and my kids love them. They are bright and colorful, with loads of great images and top notch music. I like that they vary and have different themes, our favorite is Baby Newton. I have no idea why they prefer that one, but they just do.Now, I've read some negative reviews on here and I must say I can see the point that those parents are trying to get across. But Julie Clark tells us at the end of every video that you should watch with your child and discuss what you are seeing. This is an opportunity to interact with your child, this is not intended as an electronic babysitter (Nick Jr. is the electronic video, or didn't you know?). So if used properly they are learning videos. My two kids, aged 4 and 2, enjoy the chance to spend time with a parent and learn about colors, numbers, shapes, etc. For that purpose they are great!"
3,The better of the two gift packs,"We got this gift pack and volume one for a baby shower gift.Volume one is not so great, but Volume 2 has Baby Mozart and Baby Van Gogh in it, which are both great. If you enjoy the Baby Einstein videos and don't have these, this deal is pretty good, since these are the best videos in the collection. My older daughter Emmie is just over two years. She doesn't get very much stimulation from them, but will still watch them with her new sister and me."
5,The Key Requirement is WILL,"My brother was a C student, decided he wanted to change his ways and asked for these videos. He wanted to be an A student and because of that he followed the videos and they worked.He graduated Summo Cum Laude from BYU, and will be entering Harvard's PHD program on full scholarship in the fall.His success goes back to these videos. Yes it did take a great deal of personal will and desire but with out these videos he wouldn't be as successful as he is today."
3,not bad,"This is a video version of a seminar for high schoolers, describing tips on how to be a better student. It was pretty good - though our 9th grader got bored with it at times. The presenter is an above average communicator and the production quality is excellent. At times, they skim through some of the content, and I'm not sure how much is being retained with this type of format. Some sort of discussion element or more advanced exercises might improve it."
3,Are There Aliens,"The book is about some kids that belive in aliens and one day they get a wierd e-mail sayng ""help I have been taken by aliens and i need your help"" so they go on a crazy adventure looking for there friend. On the way they run into some odd people and meet some to. it is very exciting and you want to read more to find out what happens to find out you are going to have to read. The book the book is by Anne Schraff and I sugjest you read the book.I give it 3 out of 5 stares."
4,"Beautiful, Rare Pictures","This calendar went out of date a few years ago, but it's still on my wall. In addition to illustrating some fabulous 50s cars, it also showcases the unique modernist architecture and clothing styles of this great decade.Can't get enough of it!"
5,"Great Flick, a must for MTBers or Anyone who says it can't be done.","This movie details the 2009 Leadville MTB 100 mile race to over 16,000 feet in elevation. Lance Armstrong was in the race but not the focus for all the film. Ordinary people not making the time point during the climb were featured as the ones that turned at the top successfully during a snow storm. It is a show of massive endurance, bike handling skill, and what the Colorado Rockies can do during one race. Wow, better than a Hawaii Ironman video."
3,One of the worst written books ive ever read,"I used this textbook in a class taught by one of the authors. The arrangments is designed to make it easy to skim, that is the first few pages of each section summarize the sectioin, with each new section going into more and more detail. However this makes the book very hard to read in a good flow. Depending on the level of your class, yo uwill almost invariably need to know more detail than in the first few pages. Also, the text and metaphors used are terribly written and often times sentences jsut flow badly and lead to ambiguous sentences. However, the book covers a very broad range of topics in pretty good detail. so i am giving it a modst 3/5 stars. By the way, I got a 3.5/4 in this class so i am not just complaining out of sour grapes."
5,Great value for unusual size AC filer,You can't buy this size in the stores. I was able to get them from Amazon at a very reasonable price - and they arrived quickly.
1,Won't recognize CD Burner??,I was really excited about the ease of this product until I tried to save the project to a disc. It won't recognize my burner. I went to the support web site and downloaded the patch - it still won't work. Just generic responses to email inquiries. I don't reccommend it.
5,Such a beautiful story!,This is one of our favorites! It's such a great story about an unexpected and unconventional friendship between an old dog and a young deer. Love it - it's a keeper.
4,One of the best live videos I have ever seen.,"I thought that this video was awsome. I am not really into dc hardcore but I love minor threat. I thought the sound quality could have been better, but for a live show it was really good."
4,Enjoyable if not fantastic,"If you watch this movie remembering that it's a summer movie about a caper, then you'll probably enjoy it. The cast was great, I especially enjoyed Ed Norton, Seth Green and Jason Statham (as ""Handsome Rob""). The movie had some extremely humorous parts and was pretty strong as a whole. It reminded me of ""Ocean's 11"" a little bit, but not quite as good - it didn't have the great twist ending that Ocean's 11 pulled off.Italian Job definitely had some great gags (Seth Green and Jason Statham are hilarious), and the movie as a whole was definitely enjoyable. Just don't expect too much and you'll like it."
4,Fun Film,"Fun film about a heist gone good, then bad and making up for betrayal. Great Cast and lots of fun."
5,The Italian Job(Full Screen Edition),Bought this for my husband. He always lked this movie since he had seen the older one years ago. He really enjoyed the remake.
5,Great movie won't be relesed on DVD till after remake,I love this movie. I have a video copy. They are currently filming a remake of the movie using the new Mini Cooper. My guess is that the release of the original movie on DVD is being deliberately delayed in the United States pending the release of the remake or even the DVD of the remake. In England the original 1969 movie was rereleased to theatres ayear or so ago and the DVD followed quickly thereafter.
4,Good action movie,"I love Charlize and have seen every movie she's been in so far, and this one is just fun. Seems that it would be tougher than the movie makes out to crack a safe, and I'm not sure what poliece she's working for in the beginning, but who cares because the movie is one of those popcorn munching, try not to think too much good times. at least rent it and check it out."
4,Mark Wahlberg is SOLID!!!,"While watching this movie, the movie ""Italian Job"" (with actor Mark Wahlberg in the movie)is really entertaining with having suspense, humor, action, and drama in the movie. It has everything a person wants in a movie. And it's worth watching it with Mark Wahlberg in it. :)So, if you didn't watch it, grab that tape or DVD and watch it with a love one.This tape even reminds me of ""Mission Impossible""."
3,The Italian Slob!,"Well I have to say that this isn't a very orginal plot. The stroy is bland, vapid, and cliche. The acting is good, but we've seen this story before. I really just didn't enjoy this as many people have. The direction is great, and the shooting locations are perfect. Believe me the stunts in this movie is cool, and the ending is rather entertaining, but overall there's a better movie out there waiting for you to watch it."
2,"Boring, absurd and ludicrous","I read somewhere that Edward Norton appears in this film only due to contractual obligations. He thought the sceript was silly. And it is.Man, what a stupid history. After a promising beginning, everything goes downhill. Walhberg, as always, is his wooden face best.There's only a vague idea of a plot, nothing more. A big waste of time."
1,Bah! Humbug on yet another lousy remake,"Either I've overdosed on Hollywood's feverish cannibalism of its past glories or this is just basically a lousy movie. With Mark Wahlberg in the cast, I should have been warned. He contributed mightily to the destruction of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movie franchise. In this one, he plays his usual cocky, smirking self. Why these movie makers decided to remake an okay action flick from the 70s is a mystery. You'd think that with so many countless movie majors and movie buffs and aspiring screenwriters desperate to see their work on screen, movie moguls would give them a chance--instead of feasting voraciously on past glories. I'm preparing to watch yet another remake--""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""--and I really really hope I'm going to like it because it will have to be damned good to surpass the l973 original. Advice to Mark Wahlberg: stop signing on to remake junk. Get a new agent. Do something fresh and act like you really enjoy what you're doing."
1,Stupid.,"This movie is just another Hollywood crap. Cars, blonde women, macho men, crime and revenge. Hollywood, I think it's time to make something new."
2,"The Italian Dog , er Job","I just saw the new 'The Italian Job'. I never walk out on movies, but, man, this one tempted me. After about 15 mins I asked my wife was she enjoying it, and she replied that she was. She doesn't often surprise me but this time she did.The only good things about this movie were the minis, and the villains (I love a well-played cad). On the downside, nearly every frame contained an advertisement for some product ...headsets, TV's, cars, stereos and computers (the brand name sticker on laptops cannot usually be read upside down!). The dialogue was rubbish, the characters were sterotypes, and the plot laughably predictable. I could not sympathise with any of the characters.This movie has none of the wit and charm of the original. I would give it 1 1/2 stars if I could, so 2 is being generous. ..."
3,"About one-third car chase, so beware ...","I'm sure that the MiniCooper car company had to pay a lot for the product placement here since it's then-new Minis are the real stars of this 2003 remake of a 1966 Michael Caine heist flick. The plot is some nonsense about $37 million worth of gold bars changing hands back and forth among criminals. The scenes of both a safe and then an armored car dropping through buildings and roadways are somewhat original, so I will give the filmmakers that. I haven't seen the original, so I don't know what they did in 66. Beware that most of the final third of the movie is really just a chase and it does grow tedious at times. There's not much depth to this, but you might like it if you enjoy heist movies."
5,Live the adventure again,"This DVD has the movie in widescreen. The movie was good when it came out. With the deleted sceens, the story opens up even more."
5,The Italian Job,"Anyone who has a mini cooper, must see this film. My dog does not like riding in the mini, but after watching the movie, she told me that if I would drive like they did in the film, she would love my mini!"
2,It's a so so job. No suspense. Action scenes are average. The tiny cars look cute.,It's a so so job. There's no suspense. The action scenes are average. The tiny cars look cute. I would not want to watch it twice.
4,Everything you want in an action thriller,"I love a movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to fully understand. The Italian Job is that kind of engaging, but action-packed thriller. The cast has an exciting chemistry that keeps things interesting throughout the movie. And, of course, there are the Mini Coopers. Well worth the watch, lovers of an exciting, but intellectually stimulating action thriller will love this one."
3,Not impressed,"Thought it would be more of a mafia type of movie, which I would have made it more interesting, however it's more about American crooks and I must say pretty boring too."
5,Finually a Good Movie,"... I loved this movie, I thought the plot was interesting, the music was great, (I have the CD), and of course if you are a MINI owner you will find the cars fun to watch. There was no computer enhancement with the chases. It was all done with stunt driving. Maybe today with all the computer enhancement no one can watch a really crafted movie that is done purely with talent. I just put in my order for the DVD."
4,This has just enough of everything to satisfy you,"The Italian Job holds enough funny moments and action to keep you entertained and it never gets boring! It has it all, and it ends with the perfect ending. Don't wait to see this movie!!"
4,Funniest DVD cover of all time,"An above average film with some pretty cool characters (Seth Green and Mos Def are the two best characters in the film) and some above average scenes.However, the highlight of the film is the cover of the DVD and the methods the director of photography tries to mask the fact that Marky Mark Wahlberg is about half a foot shorter than Charlize Theron! Every trick in the book is used (down shots, both characters sitting down, fast cuts).The cover is just hilarious, for it to be real Marky Mark would have to be about six foot three inches tall.A solid way to spend a couple of hours on a slow night."
1,For Your Pleasure,"For a limited time I am pleased to offer the following footage. Runs 100 feet, 8mm, color without sound.A scene of a mini car jumping a sewer; a scene of a boat chase; a scene of a dark-haired man in sunglasses getting into a sedan with a criminal air; various scenes of computer imagery produced apparently entirely with a keyboard, no mouse.Act now and I'll throw in the short featurette, Blacktop Babes. For an additional $3.oo, comes with the Viewmaster reel, Coolidge, The Unknown President."
1,Blasphemy,"Now I have to say that this film has yet to hit our shores but, in the UK, the original is such an iconic film, a film that defines the best of Brisish cinema, played most Christmas days, that the thought of a remake, let alone a foriegn remake, makes one's blood run cold. The original is perfection.....it's like trying to repaint the Mona lisa...."
5,Better than Ocean's Eleven and The Bourne Identity,"The Italian Job, which has been compared to Ocean's Eleven and The Bourne Identity, goes way above and beyond these films in pure summer entertainment. Whereas Ocean's Eleven was dragged out in some places, TIJ is beautifully edited with no ""check your watch"" scenes. And The Bourne Identity had a great car chase scene with a mini-car. The Italian Job has three!And let's not forget the plot. It's smart, with real emotion penetrating the layers of style. It twists, which is always nice :). And you feel like you can connect with the characters, which is something that doesn't often happen in an action/heist flick. Don't miss this one."
2,Not really that much action that stays on PG ground.,ITJ is a bit a dissapointment because it makes itself a film of two-halves and doesnt really engage the viewer after Donald Sutherland departs the journey ealry on.In short this is just simple Sunday afternoon entertainment and even the horribly mis-cast Ed Norton does not make an impact. The premise is simple. Robbers get robbed by one of their own and then go seek their revenged. Cue a few chase sequences and some personal family matters. It doesnt really ever get off the ground. Very average robbery hookum.
4,A Family Friendly Action Adventure Movie,This was a cute movie. It was more family friendly than I expected. It was entertaining but some scenes seemed to drag on and the film got to a point where I was ready for it to be over. It is something that I would recommend to others. Charlize Theron is beautiful and innocent like in her role and Mark Wahlberg as always is right on time with his acting. The casting was perfect and Seth Green and Mos Def provided comic relief.
1,Damaged Goods,"I ordered a new HD-DVD, and the one I received was significantly scratched...so much that it would not play properly."
2,"Doesn't ""Deliver""","band of thieves, led by Charlie Croker (Wahlberg), pulls off the ultimate heist by rigging the stoplights of the city of Los Angeles so that they can drive right out of the city with a carful of gold (in a safe that they're stealing back after Croker's double-crossing ex-partner, played by Edward Norton, stole it from Croker first), with nothing but greenlights, while everyone else gets redlights, thus keeping the roads plugged with the largest traffic jam in L.A. history, and the police from pursuing them. I didn't really enjoy this movie. the plot is corny and ed norton just doesn't look or sound like a bad guy. it does have some good action moments and it is worth too see but I wouldn't buy it"
1,Mini Cooper pornography,"This is not really a movie. Basically it's a movie length commercial for the mini cooper. This is one of those movies that everyone likes for no reason, kind of like the Bourne identity. If you really like car chases I guess you can watch this and be content, but if you like anything that resembles an entertaining movie look up something better like Wild Zero which was nominated in 40 countries for the ""best movie ever"" award. Honestly even in the car chase genre this does not seem that good. I feel like watching the Italian job is a lot like walking into a strip club for topless mini coopers and everyone is like stuffing dollar bills in the mini coopers' cup holder and under their wipers."
2,Sad excuse for a movie,"Norton made this film due to pressure from the studio to an existing contract. IT was his worst performance ever.Walhberg is almost sleeping (as always).The plot is a joke. Alright, the Mini-Coopers were a great advertising scheme, myself want to buy one right now...Seth Green was the only actor to save himself in this turkey.The bad guys (in this case, the good guys, because they steal a lot of things and get away with it!)use always the same plot: blow anything that is above our heads and the money / gold / whatever / will fall right at our side. Very clever.If stupidity has a name, it's the remake of The Italian Job."
1,waste of time,"Noisy, Unimaginative, Poor acting. Need I say more?????????Sorry I wasted 99 cents to rent this movie. One of those movies I watched to the end thinking it had to get better, but it never did. The sound was so irritating I turned it down to the minimum volume which I could still hear the talking. Don't ask me why I wanted to hear that, I haven't figured that out yet."
1,Amazon download was taking four hours to download. I canceled and downloaded from Apple in minutes,Amazon download was taking four hours to download. I canceled and downloaded from Apple in minutes. This has happened before with Amazon.Prime free search is slow and or completely stalled
5,written,I was satisfied with the seller and how they handled my situation. It was very much appreciated. I plan to order more from them again in the future. They were very professional.
3,"A classic, but...","I love this movie, I had it on DVD and I got it on HD DVD recently. My only gripe is the quality of the video transfer. There is a lot of graining and artifact noise, especially on dark scenes. The blacks on the DVD version look better than the HD DVD version's blacks..."
3,"Great film, poor transfer",I agree with one of the other reviewers here. The picture is quite grainy on a Full HD 1080P screen. 19.95 is a great price if you don't have it yet but I think the DVD looks a bit better even on a HD telly because you don't get the digital noise. Also only has Dolby Digital soundtrack so not much to be gained in terms of sound either.
4,Decent Flick,While this is not even close to being one of my favorite movies it was decent. I was a little skeptical of it because it seemed like it was going to be just another remake of tired themes. However I was surprised. The action and chase scenes are well done. The characters are realistic and well developed and the special effects are adequate. Overall this is a fairly well done film.
4,Are you in the mood for action?,"Okay, so this film is never going to win any Oscars, and the product placement may irk some. But so what? You have to know what you're going in for...and if you're in the mood for action and a cool heist plot a la Ocean's Eleven or The Thomas Crown Affair (Pierce Brosnan not Steve McQueen), then you'll probably like this one. The plot involves a team of high tech thieves who pull a job (the titular one in Italy) and are betrayed by one of their own who in the process kills the mentor of the gang (Donald Sutherland). So now they have enlisted the mentor's daughter (Charlize Theron) who is a top notch safecracker and are going to pull another job (this one's in Los Angeles) to get revenge on their former partner. The ""jobs"" are slick in execution, there are some good comedic performances (notably Seth Green), and the climactic car chase with the Minis is great! A very fun and diverting movie."
3,Poor Video Port,The video quality is sub par compared to other titles. The DVD port is much better with no digital artifacts. I guess they were in too big a hurry to release this great action flick. The digital artifacts at low light level are terrible. I borrowed a friends copy and they were both the same. Movie is as good as ever despite the poor video quality. Motion artifact on the DVD are eliminated on the Blu-Ray version.
4,Great Film,"This is a movie well worth watching at least once. I won't talk about the plot because its already been discussed in other reviews. It is not a moving or compelling film, just a very excellent action/comedy flick. It gives you plenty of laughs and keeps you on the edge of your seat the first time around. It will keep your adrenaline pumped and the ending, although not amazing, is pretty good. The actors work very well together and Mark Wahlberg does a good job as the leading actor. If you don't want a mindless action film then don't buy this. But if you want something you can soon forget and get plenty of laughs out of then this is the movie for you to see."
3,don't know how much bmw invested in this movie for mini,"watchable, but could never get connected, just like watching a two hour long bmw-mini tv commercial with a shallow storyline and mucho castings. bmw actually tried very hard to fool viewers under the age of 25 to buy the lamed under powered mini by remodelling three minis with v-8 power, rock-solid chasis, zero to 60 under 6 seconds? none of the actors in this movie seemed really to get involved in the movie. after finished watching, all i could remember is those three cute like button minis, zoom-zoom-zoom....just like some of my rich clients once told me during the last horrible recession. ""what recession?"" she answered my question with a question. about this moive....well, ""what movie? i just saw a 2-hr long car commercial. quite fun, though. definitely 100 times better than that limpy 'hollywood homicide'."""
4,Surprisingly pleasing,"I rented this movie expecting it to be another ""Ocean's Eleven"", a vastly unbelievable and disappointing endeavour. However, I was pleased to find that this is a crime caper with a warm fuzzy feeling - it seems very human and almost real. The stunts are still unbelievable of course, but the acting here is what really shines -- Marky Mark does a very good job of being sincere, and Seth Green is hysterical as ""The Napster"". Speaking of stunts, what could be funnier than a car chase involving three Mini Coopers? This is a great film if you want a little thrill with some good laughs and a happy ending. Great footage of Venice too."
3,Good Action!,"The Italian job is another antihero bank robbing gang movie. But this one does it very well. The short and sweet of it is you have a group of guys that are planning to rob a safe out of someone's house in Italy. After they successfully pull the job off, one of them turns on the rest of the group, steals all the money and gold and ends up shooting the senior most ""this is my last job and I'm retiring"" member played by the veteran Donald Sutherland. The rest of the movie is spent trying to chase down the member who stole everything and get there gold back along with a little payback. The acting is good, the action and dialogue is smartly done and keeps me very interested. I definitely liked this movie and I think if you're an action and or crime/bank job drama fan you will enjoy this DVD. Go pick it up!"
3,"Better than first one, but not as good of an ending","You may not even have known that there was another Italian Job. It starred Michael Caine and its story was a little similar to this one but not as compelling. Yet, the original Italian Job had the biggest cliff-hanging ending in the HISTORY OF MOVIES! Why didn't they do something like that here? It was a classic! I downgraded this somewhat (I probably would have given it 4 stars) due to its weak ending when they were handed the most perfect (and ironic) ending in movie history with the first movie."
2,heh? This is a B movie,"Finally saw this one and it didn't live up to expectations AT ALL. It may have been ok in theaters as a kind of summer time distracion, but this movie doesn't have a single thing going for it."
4,The italian job - a great job!,I believe this is a very well done movie! The story is simple but with a lot of finess and with several non-expected turns. The line up is impressive of course and you feel like you almost get to know the characters.http://eu.voolife.com/john
1,"Great Movie, lousy transfer.","I have this movie on regular DVD and the quality far exceeds the Blu-ray version. As another reviewer wrote, I have so much noise and a line through the center of the screen, that the movie is not watchable. These things should be recalled."
1,Blu-ray transfer... horrible!!,"the movie is great.. there are plenty of movie reviews letting you know how people liked this movie. I've always loved it and wanted to get it on blu-ray. Unfortunately the blu-ray version is pathetic. the dvd version almost looks better. grainy picture, sounds ""ok"". Those are the two things you look for being spectacular in a blu-ray and they do not deliver.-I guess this just makes it obvious that some moves were never shot or made to go to high-def. If that is the case.. just don't make a blu-ray version then. I already own the movie, now I own it twice in what I feel is the same quality. So if your the person that's doing a slow conversion over to blu-ray of your favorite movies, you might want to skip this one unless it goes on sale for like $5. I paid $10 so its not a total bust.5 stars for the movie.. 1 star for the blu-ray"
4,La job italiano,"This is a good compentant caper flick. Nicely written dialogue and easy performances make this a good film to watch. Many people have said this version is flat when compared to the original, but it holds up well. Like most caper flicks there are some plot holes, but are these movies being used as tutorial, or as entertainment. Some nice plot twists along the way definitely makes this a recommend."
3,Good entertainment !,"I will say that generally, it is a good entertainment. Norton is the nasty guy and he's cool in it. The plot and the acting are good and even if the end is very predictable, I will say that this movie is full of pressure and entertain perfectly. Good Job!Don't expect a masterpiece after all."
4,Sweet revenge,"Hollywood releases many heist movies but few carry it off like THE ITALIAN JOB. Opening with stunning views of Venice the audience is introduced to a group of unlawful crooks while pulling off the job of the lifetime: the theft of $35 million in gold bars. While driving through the Alps, Steve (Edward Norton) ambushes his comrades and takes the bounty for himself. The remainder of the movie involves his ex-comrades hunting him down and taking the gold back for himself. The catch scenes are full of action and adrenaline and the Mini Coopers are fun watch. It's a wonder how technology and clever minds united to separate Steve from his fortune. THE ITALIAN JOB is clearly a winner and shouldn't be missed. Also recommended in this genre is THE GOOD THIEF with Nick Nolte. Enjoy."
4,Cool!,"I liked this movie. Loved the minis. Enjoyed the extras, including the driving school. Too funny the clip between Charlize and Statham."
5,Thrilling,This movie is constanty thrilling. from the start when they're pulling a heist in venice all the way through to their get a way in the end.wow what a movie!
5,An all around great move!,"I had no doubts when I purchased the ticket for this movie. I knew that it was going to be a good one.The plot of this movie was well developed: a team of highly trained thieves successfully steal gold from under the feet of the owner (literly) only to be double crossed by one of there own. This is where the famous quote ""revenge is a bit**"" comes in.If you like a movie with humor, drama and a good old fashion car chase with a modern day twist, or if you want to take the family out to see a movie, this honestly is the movie to go see."
3,A fun film...but almost to clever,"Let me say that this film has an excellent cast, who works well with each other, lots of action and effects, and you'll be highly entertained throughout. The only problem I had was that everything was wrapped up too neatly, there was nothing to figure out. Other than that, it was very fun, but nothing I would watch over and over. Definitely rent it, but buying it is up to you."
4,Surpisingly good movie,"I still think Marky Mark is the weak spot in an otherwise engaging action movie. A lot of stars in the pic right before they broke out like Jason Statham, Ed Norton and Charlize Theron. All were in many movies before, but it wasn't long after this movie that most became household names. Watching this movie, you can understand their trajectory.Nice heist movie and it supposedly has as sequel coming.. ."
4,Good Actors Great action and good plot,"This was a pretty good movie. So much so that I will buy it again in Blue Ray. Just seeing Charlize, with Mark Walburg, Norton and Sutherland in one movie should say it all but also having Jason Statham was a great bonus. Very good story plot and surprise ending was great."
4,I was deeply moved,"Michael Caine plays a thief named Charlie, recently released from prision. Quickly he meets up with some of his old mates and things get going. It's time for a new job, a job in Italy. The staging is magnificent as outside forces contend against Charlie and his crew. Will he pull off his elaborate heist? Gotta see the film.The film's tongue-in-cheek approach was perfect. The film never takes itself too seriously, but it never goes too far. The characters are great, quirky, and often outrageous. I think this is my favorite Michael Caine performance. Also, there is a car chase in this film that is about as good as any I've ever seen.Okay, so I was't deeply moved, but this movie is so much fun. In a way it sort of reminded me of Guy Richie's Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, or at least the influence can be seen. I loved this movie and I loved the ending. I will be adding The Italian Job to the library."
2,Paramount drops the ball on a great movie............again,Ever since I bought the DVD several years ago it has been in my personal rotation (playing on average twice a month). After getting my Blu-ray player I knew I had to have this film. The video transfer is barely better than the DVD and lacks a lossless soundtrack. It doesn't even have the DTS soundtrack advertised on the cover. This is an utter disappointment for an otherwise great movie. There were rumors that Paramount was going to re-release the Blu-ray with remastered video and a lossless audio track(the original soundtrack was excellent). But it has yet to surface(and probably never will). This was not worth the purchase and I would have been better served just enjoying my DVD version.
4,Great Movie,"This movie is awesome. Although I didnt have a chance to see it in theaters I went and bought it. It has already been watched 3 times so it has payed for itself. This movie starts out in Venice,Italy and moves to California. The minis in this movie are spectacular and skinny pete is great. well i am telling all of you to go buy this. Its great what else can i say about this movie."
1,"Like the movie, however better on DVD",I enjoy this movie have it on both DVD and Blu Ray. The Blu Ray transfer is ABSOLUTELY AWFUL! Don't buy it!
1,"Italian Job - Blu-Ray, Great Movie, poor quality video","I recently rented this movie from Netflix and I'm glad I didn't buy it due to the poor video quality. The picture is grainy at 1080P like others described especially at low light levels. When you spend the money upgrading to Blu-Ray, there is a certain expectation that the quality will be substantially better, and in this case it is awful. A pity since this is a great movie. Paramount, shame on you."
1,Movie is great... Blu-Ray is terrible,"We have a top of the line Sony 52"" XBR TV and Sony Blu-Ray player we purchased for Christmas and I purchased the Blu-ray version of this movie because we enjoy the movie so much. It wasn't worth it! It has trouble rewriting quickly during the action scenes. We actually compared it to the regular DVD that we own and to be honest... it isn't worth the additional expense to purchase the Blu-ray. Overall, we have noticed that with all of the older movies that have been converted to Blu-ray... they tend to be a disappointment in the blu-ray version for the same rewriting problems. However, animations are incredible and all of the new movies that have recently been released in the theaters that are just coming out on Blu-Ray are great... like Ironman... that one was incredible on Blu-ray."
1,"Entertaining movie, terrible Blu-ray quality.","I enjoyed this movie, but the quality of this Blu-ray release is just awful. It was so bad in some spots that it became a distraction from the movie itself. I would recommend holding off until it is remastered."
3,Decent thief flick,"Con man's flick of decent proportions. Very deep cast of actors remake the classic from 1969 of the same title. The opening sequence is Bondish for planning and audacity, and is the highlight of the film. Excellent soundtrack and Venice as a backdrop provides a prime filming location. The car chase scenes in the Mini Coopers were very different and edgy. Jason Stathem has a rather subdued role compared to his Transforporter performances. Edward Norton shines as the dispicable con's con, who gets payback in a rather delicious fashion. Charlize Theron plays the hottie thief, trained by daddy thief. Mark Wahlberg has a major role, but comes off a bit stiff. The movie overall has sort of a pieced together feel to it, but is still a fun flick to watch. Once."
3,Double Charge,I was double charged and couldnt figure out how to let you know. I was billed 2.99 and 3.99. I watched the NON-HD version but billed both.
3,a great cast can't rise above this ho-hum caper film,"This is a remake of a mediocre caper film made with Michael Caine, whose role is reprised by Mark Wahlberg; also in this update are Donald Sutherland, Edward Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron. You'd think with that cast, early locations in Venice and a reputedly spectacular car chase, you'd have a decent action film here, right? Unfortunately, the script is tepid at best, with poor Donald S. having to utter some of the goofiest lines I've heard in a while.DVD extras include featurettes about the driving, the cars and the stunts as well as an 18-minute making-of feature, a trailer and 6 deleted scenes. The film can be heard in English or French with optional English subtitles.There is nothing new or remarkable here, though it's harmless enough if you like these actors or want to see a few minutes filmed in Venice or would like to see the Mini-Cooper car chase."
2,Couldn't finish it!,"I tried to read this book,but I couldn't follow it. I got to about page 55 when I just couldn't take it anymore. I usually try to finish any book I start, but this one was torture. She jumps from character to character, and I just couldn't follow her. I wasn't sure who was who, or what was what. I was still waiting to find out what happened to El. I'm willing to give her first book a try, because I've read some pretty good reviews about it, but I wouldn't suggest this one to anyone."
1,Much too confusing,"As much as I enjoyed Ms. Trice's first book, OTIWFH, this new one just threw me for a loop because I got lost trying to follow the characters and the logic of the storyline. Tip to the wise: borrow it from the library."
4,"THANK YOU, DAWN TURNER TRICE","AT FIRST I HAD A LITTLE DIFFICUTY DECIPHERING WHO WAS WHO AND WHAT WAS WHAT. FINALLY GETTING INTO THE BOOK, HOWEVER, I FOUND THAT IT WAS WELL WORTH THE EFFORT. THE CHARACTERS ARE EVERYDAY PEOPLE,TRYING TO MAKE THE BEST OF THE HAND THAT LIFE HAS DEALT THEM. THIS IS THE VERY THING THAT MAKES THEM ALL SO ENDEARING--EVEN VIOLA'S DOGS THAT WON'T RUN AWAY BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THEMSELVES TO BE TIED UP.VERY UNIQUE--VERY SWEET AND I'M GRATEFUL TO MS.TRICE FOR A NOVEL THAT I WON'T SOON FORGET."
5,Magical,"Though the DVD quality looks like it used to be VHS, the images are lovely and bring out the magical feeling of Christmas. I pour my family & myself some warm spiced apple cider, and enjoy."
5,Great to use while putting up decorations!,My family and I love this! We have used this for several years as one of the first things we watch to start the Christmas season and have incorporated it into our Christmas traditions while we put up decorations. Our kids also love watching all of the lights and listening to the music.We also watch and love some of these other similar titles:In The Christmas SpiritChristmas Goes Baroque - A Naxos Musical Journey
5,Great movie,This movie is actually good.. not your typical Lamas film.... Has a decent story line and acting as well..One of Lorenzo's better films for sure.
4,music,Very lovely Christmas music. Will be listening a lot to this CD. I really enjoy this jazz music and style
1,"Pure, unadulterated lies and unfounded accusations",Don't waste your money and time with this trash. If I could I would give it a -5 rating.
1,A companion to the WARREN REPORT and CASE CLOSED,"This is an extremely bad volume. Fetzer's theories are nutty and not worthwhile. Read the reviews of this book found in www.jfklancerforum.com for all the major problems in the books. Fetzer's previous books had worthwhile material, but this book is a joke book. It goes in the fiction section of the library, together with the WARREN REPORT, CASE CLOSED, and CONSPIRACY OF ONE."
1,Load of Old Rubbish,"I have read just about every book written on the JFK Assassination and this is possibly the worst pro-conspiracy effort I have seen. The chapter by John Costella is the most ridiculous piece of nonsense written on the subject since the single bullet theory. Am I to believe that there was a custom made movie made by the perpetrators of this heinous crime? bollocks! It is pretty obvious that the Zapruder film was tampered with in the same way as every other piece of evidence in the case but a ""pilot film"", give me peace. Stop picking through crumbs and look at the big picture - Your government is corrupt and not enough of your countrymen care enough to prosecute those responsible."
5,Riveting,"When my 23 month-old daughter gets cranky, this is one of the videos that immediately gets her calm. And 35-year old myself am waiting for the next time I play this video for my baby. I love the presentation and singing."
5,"Ok Show, Unleilivible Game!","This game is unbelievible! Apart from the fact that there is hundred new Poke'mon, you can play them 2 at atime! And say bye to Team Rocket! Now there is only the Magma and Aqua team. (Magma-Ruby Aqua-Saphire) And on top of that you can chose wether you wanta boy trainer or a girl trainer. And this time in Ruby And Saphire you can chose from these three Poke'monTorchic-fire/bird typeMudkip-waterTreecko-grass/lizardAnd there are 2 new legendary creatures(but I can't remember thier names right now). And not to mention more evolution forms for the old Poke'mon. Also, there is a new profesor. Well, my overall all review for this game is unbelievible. I stongly suggest that you buy Poke'mon Ruby or Saphire."
4,Pokemon Ruby,This game is really good for gamers young and old.The Battling system has really been improved from previous games. Being able to have two pokemon in battle at once is great. The new world of Hoenn is fantastic with something new around every corner. The wild Pokemon do get on your nerves after a while but overall it it a really enjoyable experience. And you get so much satisfaction when you beat the elite four for the first time. Personly I just love to keep going back to fight them.Its my opinon that to get the most out of the game you will need to trade with Pokemon Sapphire. I bought both and I'm really glad I did.
4,It was good,"I thought the game was good, but the game was way too short. I thought we would have to do more things after beating the league and all we have to do now is ""catch em' all"". I was hoping for more things to do in the game. But i liked it."
3,Pokemon!,"Hi, I thought this toy was pretty fun. It's great for girls and boys. It is a great christmas or birthday present to give to any child who's obseesed with pokemon cards and pokemon stuffed animals."
5,I didn't think they could make it..,"Most of the information has already been given out about this game, but just to clear things up:1.There are exactly 200 Pokemon known in the game (Well...Not really, youll see what i mean).2.The 200 Pokemon are a mixture of the Oldest (like Geodude), the Neo (Gold and Silver)(Like pichu) and the new ones (Latios)3.The charecters look sweet!(Well at least the people you play)"
4,not as good as I expected,"This game is awesome great graphics,new legendary pokemon,and more,but there's 2 problems with this game.(1)You can't trade with older version the max number of pokemon you can get is 202, you can't use mewtwo(which is my favorite),charizard or none of the old pokemon just a few of them like pikachu .(2)there's only one world instead of 3 like I expected,so there's no kanto or johto just ""new"" and ""improve"" hoenn.But there's something great about the game,there's a secret island which you get when you have all six of the things in the traner's card,ex.beat pokemon league,beat battle tower,win one of the contest,fight a friend, and the other 2 i don't know (note:you need the ticket for the island which is ""eon ticket"" you get it by game shark or action replay,or maybe there's another way but that's the only 2 I know about).so if you're looking for some good 2 on 2 pokemon fight ruby is all you need(and a link cable for gameboy advance and 3 other friends).God Bless"
4,Pokemon Ruby,"I personally really like this game. The addition of footprints, rain, and the deep pools in the water are great. I also like the idea of secret bases, mine is in the tree on route 111 lol. I am on my way to challenging the Elite four and the Champion and i can't wait until i finish the game."
2,pokemon Advance 7000,"this pokemon game is like no other. It is the best graphic game for gameboy ever ( Thats what I think). The only down fall is that you can only have 200 pokemon insted of 354 (including new Deoxys and jirachi). I think everyone with a game boy advance should get this game. you can become a boy or girl, 2 on 2 battle,aero or mach bike, and the new pokemon are the best."
4,yikes! this was a shocker!,"when pokemon first came out, i thought it would last maybe a few months or so. but pokemon fever is still thriving! i had no idea how awesome (and easy) the games were until i bought pokemon ruby. i thought it might be a little, well, young for me, since i'm 16. but i fell in love with the game after only a few plays! the little creatures are adarable and i love being able to read about them in the pokedex. the fights are pretty simple, but just exploring all the islands is a whole lot of fun! i'd recomend this game to anyone, except maybe people who want a real challenge."
4,New Relase Info,This game looks very fun . I am going to get it on its first day if I can figure out the realease date. I have played the japanese version but now I actually want to know what there saying. In conclusion I just cant wait until it comes out.
4,A new one coming out!,For all the people that think there has to be another pokemon game there is but there is no release date for the usa but I am guessing that it should come out late 2004. They are called pokemon fire red and leaf green they are remakes of blue and red but for the later versions if you are thinking what is version green? Green never made it to the usa but in japan they got red and green as there first old versions and blue as a later version.Also this is a secret that came out in september there is going to be a bundle pack in japan but I dont know about the usa but it is going to be bunddled with the game it is a wireless link to link up your 2 3 or 4 or even 5 GBASP's with out the wire and this time you can link up 5 people now. Also the pokemon game will be able to be linked up to pokemon colosseum and compatable with rubby and saffire.
3,Ruby Red,"This was purchased for my 9 year old grandson. I purchased it for Christmas, but the first one didn't work and I had discarded the return information. So I tried again. It was delivered quickly and according to my grandson ""it rocks"". If he's happy, I'm satisfied."
4,awsome,"The minute I got this game I loved it even though Im a girl who is a little weird, I still think if girls tryed it they would like it. Right now I have a leval 79 pokeman and my brother hasa leval 100 but Im still good."
1,Incorrect Order - beware,"I ordered Pokemon Ruby and was shipped Pokemon FireRed. Unfortunately i didn't realize it was the wrong game until my son opened it on Christmas Day. If you order from this seller, be sure you get what you ordered."
1,trustworthiness,the game i purchased is one of my old time favorites and i cant even play it bc the game doesnt save. the file has been screwed with so it wont save anything
4,New Monsters New Lands New Fun,"This game is like the defenition of fun. I started out with Mudik but I do reccomend starting out with Treecko. He can take out the first couple of gym leaders easy,plus his third form looks pretty cool. I never chose him but my rival uses it. My friend started out with Tortick. There's a lot more to do in this one. You can run and you can dive into water and catch Pokemon you can't catch on land. I caught Groudon but the bad thing is I used my Master Ball to do it. Here's some tips. Like I said before start out with Treecko,be sure to catch alot of Zigzagzoons because each one comes with a rare item,and be sure to catch Groudon because he's stronger than a level 60. Well I hoped this helped you a bit."
4,Pokemon Ruby,I think pokemon is one of the most addicting game titles out there. Pokemon ruby is no exception it provides you with at least 20 hours a gameplay and if you compete in the contests and complete the mini quests it will provide you with even more playing time. Overall I would give this game about a 41/2 star rating.
5,13 And Still Trying To Catch Em' All,"I am 13 and still playing Pokemon.I just got this game today and have yet to play it because i lost my game boy advance. But i am assuming it will be a good game. It seems quite fun. All of the Pokemon games that I have are. I have the blue, yellow, silver, and gold versions. The one problem is not with the game but with the system. I think it will be anoying how you cannot trade with older versions of Gameboy, so you need two GBA's. And Nintendo should change the plot of the games. Its the same thing over and over again. Go to the gyms, collect badges, beat up team rocket (now team magma/aqua), try to become the best trainer, and find the one special pokemon. Other than this i think it will be a good game."
3,"Here's Groudon, but where's Kyogre?","I rate this game 3 stars because it is tough to beat without a guide, and certain Pokemon, like Groudon only show up here. Kyogre is in the Sapphire along with Latias. Latios is in Ruby however. Also, you can only choose one starter Pokemon. Most of the old Pokemon are gone. Bulbasaur has been replaced by Treeko. Charmander has been replaced by Torchic, and Squirtle has been replaced by Mudkip who is my favorite by the way. Cyndaquill, Chikorita, and Totodile are gone as well. You can link up and fight 2-on-2 battles with your friends. You can mix berries in a Berry Blender and feed PokeBlocks to Pokemon, and compete in contest like Beauty, Cool, Tough, Smart, and Cute contests. See ya!"
1,it sucks!!!!!!,"got the game and it dont work, it keep freezing.. tried to contact seller on several occasions and they didnt even contact me back (bad business)!!! will never do business with them again!! consumer beware!!!! i had to contact amazon to get my money back!! im piss!!!"
2,pathetic attempt,"the makers tryed to release this so people will go back into the pokemon craze. it won't work, so why they bother?"
3,"if only, if only...","Ya, I know the pokemon craze is over, and I've always hated all the crap WB and Nintendo sell out with this franchise, but Pokemon Red was the first video game I ever played, and I will kep buying these games to the very end. But not this one. to be perfectly honest, I have raised the same Pokemon from red to crystal, trading them down the line. luckily, all previous pokemon titles have been backward compatible, so I could keep the same creatures. But not this one. to remain perfectly honest, I would love to bring my old creatures to a completely revolutionized 4-on-4 battlefield, but I cant. so, to remain perfectly honest, I must admit that I would buy this, but I won't."
1,The Most Dullest game I've ever played!,"Please all reviewers read this review with an open mind. Thank you. THIS GAME IS THE MOST BORING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE. This game has No replay value. and not to mention its so easy it makes me sick. When nintindo made this game it must have been for babies! I completed that Pokemon Ruby 8 times with no enjoyment. I played it again and again expecting somthing more. Oh, and guess what. This game has not a drop of replay value. Nope. Not a drop. The only reson I played it so many times is because that was my only game. To this day I dread that moment I placed in my order for this game. Influenced by all the good reviews. Please don't make my same mistake. The people who wrote thats its a super game, they don't now what there talking about. If you want a good game. I suggest Golden Sun 2 the lost age. At least its a true game that is worthy of a good review."
2,Game Boy advanace has nothing on reality,"what???okay so i got this game for my brother timmy and THIS GUY IS JUST PLAYING AND PLAYING AND PLAYING IT!!1) NOW THAT acne encrusted punk will never get a date to the prom2) i want to play catch with him but he's all ""gotta dedicate my life to pokemon ruby""3) NOW THAT he has it the whack punk never studies! he can kiss his dreams of being a Stanford undergrad goodbyethanks a lot ninento. I'm being sarcastic with that last sentencethis game is runing my kid borhters life and it should be banned on the mareket"
4,Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a great game. You may battle a lot of people over and over again. You get tons of money when you win. If I were you, I'd buy this game but that's just me. Saphire is a great game also. Both games are the same but they both have different Pokemon. I like Saphire the most."
4,Great Game,A whole world in a chip.This game is excellent.Excellent for kids and you'll get addicted too.The only thing I wish is that you could store more than one game at a time.
4,"Great game, but time battery ran dry",the time-based events wont happen anymore but the game still works fine and is really fun and addicting. This is a must have for gba owners
5,A staple in GBA gaming,"Okay, so a lot of people aren't fans of the 3rd generation of Pokemon. However, this is such a good game. There is a lot more to do and a step up in the storyline since the second generation. There is also a lot more challenge and new combination types that haven't been seen before. The only thing that was wrong with my copy was that the sound dulls after you save the game. This might seem bad, but when a pokemon is at low health, you don't hear the annoying effect. It's a great game."
3,Game works... mostly,"It's great to finally have this game, but it's kind of disappointing to see that the internal battery died out."
4,This is short,Well this game still has it.You can still clone pokemon.Do you want to know how?Well it is simple.when you put a pokemon in a box and when you switch it to another it saves.well turn it off before it saves and you will have the original in the box you first put it in and the clone in the box you were about to change to.You can also clone items with the pokemon.You have make the pokemon hold the item you want cloned and clone the pokemon.Then check the box you put the pokemon in and the clone and you will have to of that item.So you can clone a MASTER BALL!!!!!!!!.See ya.
4,absolutely brill!,"I haven't actually got the game yet, but my friends got it and she let me play on it for a bit. It's absolutely brilliant! the graphics are amazing and the new poke'dex and team display look great! I happily played on it for five hours and can say that none of the fun died down during that time! the new poke'mon are inventive and different (Even if their names are rubbish!) and i think that this game's new two on two battling is a hell of a lot more fun and challenging.The reason why i only gave the game four stars is because i think the only downside is the fact that you can't bring very many of the old poke'mon into the new game and the new name's and poke'mon are not quite as appealing. If you are a fan of poke'mon but don't wish to leave your old 251 behind, then buy this game but don't get rid of your other ones, if you are willing to try something new, then get this, you won't be dissapointed! trust me, this game rocks and i can't wait to own it for myself!"
4,The best version yet!!!,"I can sum it up in 2 words: IT RULES!!! it supposed to be a lot harder than the others, seeming to be for very experienced trainers(like myself!). i heard a rumor that it comes w/ a promo card, but i am not sure of the rumor's credability. don't get it 4 the card-there isn't one! however, it is supposed to be the best and most involved one yet.ROCK ON, TRAINERS!"
2,Boring.,"Ruby really disappoints me. The game is boring and has NO replay value.Don't get me wrong; Leaf Green was SO much better than this.You'd probably have more fun playing the other games, just skip this, you won't be missing out on much."
3,Didn't live up to the hype by a long shot.,"*PROS**Lots of towns, cities and islands to explore*Cute starters*Graphics improved in spades over Gold/Silver versions*Colorful*Interesting*Engulfing like the others*CONS**Too many ugly, and strangely creepy Pokemon to look at*Not as fun as the older games*Felt rushed*One main character (Boy) has white hair which was manage-able but the girl had wings as bangs (**LOL** I hated that! and picked the boy most of the time)*The Pokemon Gym Leaders weren't all that cool3.5 stars."
4,Pokemon!,"Yea. I used to be crazed about pokemon. Pokemon cards, toys games... all that good stuff. Though I have gotten rid of all that stuff and I'm ""grown up"" now.... I am still going to get this game. Pokemon started in the gameboy format, and Ruby, Saphire are sure to be big hits! I don't even remember most of the original pokemon's names, but this game is so great you cant pass it up!It's like an RPG, but with a twist. The random overworld enimies (the pokemon) you want to find instead of avoid. There are endless possibilites.My rating: 8/10"
3,Pokemon Ruby Review,"I have been playing this game for about two hours now. I don't like it as much as the previos Pokemon games because most of the old Pokemon simply don't exist in this version. Everything is completely different. The only games you can link up with are Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, not Red, Blue, Yellow, Silver, Gold, or Crystal. This game is good, however, for people who have not previously played any other Pokemon games."
1,Pokemon ruby,I have not recieved my game so I have no idea how this game is. I have been waiting for over a month and still have not received it. I would like to know why so someone please help me with this.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM SELL A LOT,Sell A Lot seller is a BAD person to deal with!!!!DO NOT BUY FROM SELL A LOTTHEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING
4,The honest truth about this game pleassse read,"I don't know why nintendo did this ruby and sapphire are horriblethis game is full of cons like you can't trade to R,b,y,s,g,c, its impossible to catch 'em all,they took out all your old favirot pokemon like mewtwo,can't use gb color ,it don't get dark,the pokemon don't move like in crystal,it takes too long to save,too hard to catch pokemon and use hm moves,the elite 4 are way 2 hard,no more cool cheats like missingno.,thegame isn't original like red and blue were,im sorry to say the 2on2 battles are sooooo stupid!! this is a step down from crystal!!If i were you go buy red or crystal versions they're the best.PS graphics are still bad for a gba game and there is no good thigs about this game at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great Game,this was a great game that i still love and can't go out of style. It has the thrilling exhilaration of watching your Pokemon grow and evolve right before your eyes.
3,Internal Battery,I love pokemon and I decided to buy this game because I had nothing better to do with my life >.> When it arrived I was like a 13 year old girl at a Justin Beaver concert and then it said the internal battery was dry so that was disappointing. Make sure you contact the seller before buying!
5,They're nice.,"Got these in black for a raptor and they went on easy, work and look really nice. No complaints at all."
1,SLEEP- O -MATIC! GUARENTEED SLEEP IN LESS THAN 15min,A complete waste of my time. About two boys who are left home alone. They basically just fight and call eachother names. Who needs this video when you have kids that do the same thing live! Do not waste your time and money on this piece of trash. ( I suggest getting good burger for your kids)
1,Incredibly hard to read,"We picked this book as the source of a ""Bible Study"" in Church. HOWEVER, it's not very easy to adapt to a Sunday School discussion, and is very hard to read. It focused on the costumes of the times, and several other areas that you probably never considered. Which can be good or bad, depending on your view. I would NOT recommend it."
4,Works just fine,"OK the front end is a little busy and yeah there are some prominent financial institutions not recognized (CapitalOne and Bank of America) but I've had no problems with bugs or crashes. After an install on a W98se box, that was flawless, I immediately downloaded the latest update and patches. What can I say? It works just fine."
2,Not Worth The Upgrade,"I am a heavy user of Quicken, both for home and business. I have found no discernable improvement in Quicken 2004 over Quicken 2003. The screens look a bit different, but they didn't bother to fix any of the bugs or flaws. For example, the business statement facility still has almost no customization available. You can't track the performance of non-investment accounts, such as CDs or interest-bearing checking accounts.Advertisements are still present on almost every screen and still annoying. Don't waste your money unless you have an ancient version."
5,Best 80L backpack out there,"Better than expected!I bought this pack on November 2009 for a week mountain trip, this pack handled all my gear ( I mean every single thing I could pack) including 2 3L camelback bladders, my eureka 2XT tent, 2 sleeping bags, food, 4 Nalgene wide mouth water bottles, Coleman stove Coleman propane gas, ez rest mattress...It handled 60lb very comfortably! I highly recommend this backpack, I have 6 months using it every month and its just the best backpack I have ever used."
5,Great!,"This is an amazingly strong, very nice pack that fits amazingly and makes any load seem light. Great pack! Well worth it!"
5,Mike,"Great item for all waterman. Excellent for swimming, tri-ath and as undergarment support when scuba diving and surfing."
3,I wish these were better,"When you think of speedo, this is the classic suit. Too bad it is marred by cheap fabric and poor construction as well as fitting unflatteringly to most bodies. I love the red color of the speedo I bought but there are just so many better options for swimwear now that speedo as lost its touch. I hope they improve this product."
2,Spedo Bathing suit,"Bathing suit is good quality. Using the bathing suit every day at an indoor pool, the suit requires a through rincing because evenutally the colrene in the pool causes fading of the material and snaging."
4,"Should older men wear Speedos? If you swim regularly and have the body to prove it, of course!","Speedo makes great swimwear, and this suit is good for general use. As others have reported, it's best to order one size larger than your regular pants waist measurement. Not quite as durable as their Endurance line, but with normal care, I expect this suit will last through several months of daily pool swimming.Should older men wear Speedos? If you swim regularly and have the body to prove it, of course!"
1,"A month later, NO DELIVERY","How lame... 30 days later, no shipment, no delivery.Very disgusted.Information about shipmentShip Method: USPSTracking Number: 910Status: In transitOrder #: 103Shipment Date: Jul 17, 2005Destination: West Hollywood, CA, United StatesEstimated Arrival: Jul 26, 2005Date Time Location Service Area Checkpoint DetailsJul 19, 2005 --- US Carrier notified to pick up packageJul 17, 2005 05:19:00 PM HEBRON KY US Arrival Scan"
4,Too Small,"This is a fine quality Speedo, but I have found that the sizing is small. I would have needed to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger."
3,Cuts into thighs too tight and doesn't last very long,"I'm a regular swimmer (3 times / week). These look cool but cuts into the thighs. Also, after about 10 months it falls apart, even though I'm very careful about maintenance, like not stretching it too much when pulling it on and off and rinsing it throughly in fresh water after using it in a chlorinated pool."
3,definitely an acquired taste,"I thought I'd try this after reading about Ms Yano's history of collaboration with David Sylvian, one of my favorite singers. Unfortunately I find this album hard to take; bland, slick instrumentals backing up a woman in her thirties who sings, in a cutesy, little girl's voice, about fey topics like how she'd like to eat a bowl of noodles. I suggest you give the sample tracks a few very good listens before you purchase."
5,Little Drummer Boy,What a wonderful experience . . . not only did I get the CD in time to listen for Christmas eve but I was able to listen to it a few days before. It was shipped VERY VERY QUICKLY!! Thank you. This was the first album I had bought when I was 9 years old 39 years ago . . . it was almost identical. I lost the album in a flood and was quite upset. Thank you for bringing such joy to my Christmas this year.
4,Brings back memories,"I grew up listening to this album on LP. The Harry Simeone Chorale was one of the very best. The scriptural inerludes made the album very special to me. For many years I have been looking for a CD replacement. It is as beautiful as I remember. My only complaint is the lack of liner notes. I remember the back of the LP having the lyrics and the scriptural interludes clearly marked. Without those I wasn't 100% sure it this was the same album until I heard the first interlude. With or without the liner notes though, I would recommend this to anyone who loves well preformed traditional Christmas music."
3,The Little Drummer Boy,"I was trying to purchase the original Harry Simeone Chorale's Drummer Boy and received this. It was okay, a mixture of songs, but I treasure the original one. Very short album, but price was good, so I was not disappointed."
4,Sing Me Now of Christmas,"Grew up listening to this at my Grandmother's house in the 60's. While this kind of singing and arrangement isn't to my usual taste, it works perfectly for this music. Brings back great memories--not only for me, but for my Mother who suffers from Alzheimer's. I put this on for her this past Christmas and she just beamed."
4,Traditional Carols,"Had this album when it first came out on vinyl. Still love it, even though recording quality leaves a bit to be desired."
5,Classic Album,I bought this for my wife who still has the original vinyl record...this has made her holiday seaon....for the price it is very reasonable
5,This is the same as the 1963 record!,"I'm thrilled to have found this particular version of the Little Drummer Boy -- this one is the CD version of the 1960s vinyl album, The Little Drummer Boy: A Christmas Festival (20th Century Fox Records, TFM 3100). I'd bought the similarly-namedThe Little Drummer Boya few years ago, but it's a completely different version than the 1963 original, with a number of different songs.This version, with the b&w; drawing of the drummer boy on a white background and a green border, is the right one! The songs are in the same order as the record, and each track corresponds to the divisions on the record; side A is tracks 1-5 and side B is 6-10.

5,Welcome Back Little Drummer Boy!,"Receiving ""The Little Drummer Boy"" by the Harry Simeone Chorale from Amazonlet me step back in time and enjoy that beautiful album again (on CD this timearound.) It's a great addition to my Christmas CD collection. Thanks Amazon!"
4,The Little Drummer Boy,"What wonderful, beautiful Christmas music. The Little Drummer Boy is one of my favorite Christmas carols. I only take away one star because the remastering is not very good and I can hear a buzz. On my home system I can clearly hear it, but I find it unbearable over headphones. It's too bad, because this is such fabulous classic recording. Even so, I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys choral music."
1,A Disapointment,"I have been dancing the tango for about 10 years, so when I heard about this movie I was anxious to see it. However, it appeared locally for only about two weeks, and after seeing the DVD I know why. It was a big disappointment. The plot very thin, and the dancing--with one exception--was a letdown.I think many people would watch this movie just to see the dancing. But there was so little of it, and what was shown was not even that good. The best dance demonstration was at the end of the film, perhaps as a consolation. If you'd like to see an excellent tango movie, check out ""Tango"". It was made in Buenos Aires about ten years ago, and might be available at your local library. You won't be disappointed with this one."
1,A Total Waste of TIme,"We rented the DVD based on past performances of Robert Duvall but this film is sub-standard of his history. There were entirely to many subtitles you had to read, the plot was boring and hard to follow. Wife and I were very anxious for this piece of junk to end. We are both glad we did not buy it. One of the worst films we've seen."
1,Virtuallu Unwatchable,"This movie is so bad that I had to struggle to make it through the 20 minutes that I DID watch. Duvall has obviously gone with the ""unscripted dialogue"" approach in an attempt to make the characters sound ""real"". Ironically, it makes the dialogue so jilted and forced that you can TELL exactly what is going on - and the characters sound even MORE false! A big disappointment for Duvall fans."
4,It's a given.,Uhohh. Now my ears are green.I'm sorry. I've wasted your time.But he said it wasn't our fault.
3,Flawed film worth a look to fans of Duvall or tango,"A low-level Mafia hitman is sent to Argentina to kill a retired general for his 'crimes against humanity'. The general has an accident (breaks his leg) and so the assasination is postponed and the hitman, who likes ballroom dancing, takes tango lessons.The film is basically an excuse to show off the tango sequences and dancing of Duvall's current girlfriend (in real life). She basically steals the movie. Duvall is a great actor but this isn't the best vehicle for him though it could have been much better with a better script and a more compelling story.As it is the story is weak and flawed. Still, Duvall in a mediocre film is better than most other actors around and his girlfriend is spectacular. Worth viewing once, especially for Duvall fans or fans of tango."
2,Not what I expected.,"This is not Robert Duvall at the top of his game. Weak story photography by a thirteen year old, difficult to follow. Even good Tango Dancing couldn't save this film"
5,Another side of Duvall,"For about 20 years I've said, ""When I grow up I want to marry Robert Duvall."" I've watched Lonesome Dove a half dozen times, thrice with best friends. Duvall is incredible. This movie, though, shows a whole 'nother side of him and I just love both that and the movie, and the dancing ... I've rarely in 50+ years seriously envied anything or anyone, but I do envy his wife. Duvall deserves every award and accolade he's ever had, but surely should have got more for this film."
2,Waste of time,"This movie is a waste of time and money. The story is boring, the acting is lousy, the music is weak, and the dancing is in very short clips and is mediocre at best. There are a few nice scenes of the city - Buenos Aires that is - not Brooklyn. But that's about it. Clearly, Duvall wanted to make a movie about his passion - argentine tango. But he had no story. Apparently he worked on this script for many years. Maybe he should have stopped long time ago."
1,An exercise in weak connections,"Robert Duvall could very well be the same character he played in The Apostle as he represents in Assassination Tango. He has the same impatient fervor, passionate obsessions, and bowlegged swashbuckling strut. Rather than get into a new character method, Duvall plays himself again with a new hobby - tango. And how to make a movie about tango interesting? Complement it with an ""International Man of Murder Mystery"". Duvall is a fine actor, and I do appreciate him. However, this movie bored me to tears. The tango dancing is exquisite. The indigineous Argentinians are charismatic, beautiful dancers and a joy to watch. By the end of the film it feels like a geriatric tour-de-force -- trying to hold onto youth by obsessing over a hot young tango dancer... and a 10 year-old daughter back home. I develop an interest in taking tango lessons and a nostalgia for Duvall's excellent opus, The Apostle...."
1,Assassination Tango,"This DVD won't play. It's useless to me. The vender keeps asking me for the description, which I can not find. I don't understand why a DVD formatted to play insome other country would be sent to America.fred hamilton"
1,Ridiculous,"Because I have a grandson in BA, I like to watch anything Argentine. This movie is ridiculous. Not only is the storytelling poor, the plot absurd, the accents, the portrayal of Portenos, the caricature of The Tango are ridiculous. Unless you are interested in a few frames of BA neighborhood footage (as I am), PASS."
2,just didnt go anywhere,"The movie wasn't about Tango so much, it wasn't about the mob so much. It just didn't really go anywhere. It could of been a contender, but sadly it wasn't."
1,"Pathetic, self indulgent crap","Duvall should have raised money for a serious documentary on the Tango, if his love for the form is all he says it is. Instead, he elected to make a pathetically self indulgent mob hit film that plays like just one groaningly long paean to his waning virility. No plot, just an excuse to show off his young Argentine girlfriend and to play the tough guy one last time. And all that ""Papito"" stuff with a young prostitute, and the shots of a black panther slinking around...oh, please."
3,"""Remember, tomorrow is promised to no one""","In ASSASSINATION TANGO Robert Duvall plays an assassin sent to Argentina to kill a general, but when his assignment is delayed, he meets a gorgeous tango dancer (Duvall's real-life love, Luciana Pedraza) and becomes enraptured with that world. Unfortunately this film starts off slow and really doesn't get off the ground at all. There are several holes in the plot and many questions left unanswered. Robert Duvall's acting is good, but the story lacks substance. If it weren't for the beautiful scenery of Buenos Aires and the scenes of tango dancing this DVD would not be worth watching. Generally I enjoy Robert Duvall's films, but this one fell short of my expectations. 2.5 stars."
1,ego city,"This film was written, directed by, and starring Robert Duvall. The actor has made some marvelous movies over the years, but when given total control, he failed badly. Assassination Tango is one of the worst films of the first half of the 21st century. Duvall, I fear, was simply over his head. The story is incoherent, the long improvised scenes are embarrassingly bad, and the characters are nebulous at best. Quite elderly Duvall apparently wanted to show how sexy and tough he still was; think Marlon Brando and another Tango movie. What a full-scale disaster."
3,Assasinated Tango,"This film illustrates Duvall's passion for and interest in Dancing.He has (briefly) danced before in film but here Tango is to the fore.Forget the ""hit-man"" plot it's not worth the trouble and how he couldwalk away from that woman (a great Tango dancer aswellas a looker)is beyond me. See it ONLY for some tango scenes. N.B. theyoung girl showing Duvall how to hook and kick.Unless you are (very) keen on tango - avoid."
5,Truly Clueless About Cars,"We bought this book - An Easy Guide to Car Maintenence and Repair - to have a basic how to book on this subject ""just in case"" we need it one fine day. More for me -and I found it very readable and informative."
4,Explained is as Explained does,"Even if you have never read any of Toni Morrison's work, reading this commentary and explication is such an enjoyable experience, you might put aside that other book that you haven't yet finished. David has a technique and style of drawing you into his unique approach to literary criticism--which this is not--and to chatty and healthy conversation about what Toni Morrison did or did not do, and what her books really mean. Eye-opening and quite entertaining, this work will likely be consulted by many a student in many a literature course, and by many a fan of Morrison. It jusy might open the door to a whole new school of interpretation!"
1,"Teachers, don't bother","If you're planning to teach Morrison, don't bother purchasing this book; for lit instructors, it isn't going to provide profound insights. ""Approaches to Teaching the Novels of Toni Morrison"" was far more helpful in my experience."
1,Save your money!,"In this book one will find information about Morrison's novels which is universally known. It is a kind of anthology of bit and pieces of reviews and critiques; it is bereft of anything original. What is missing is any attempt by the author to analyze subtextually any of the novels. I found the chapter on ""Jazz"" woefully inadequate and chatty. If, according to the author's admission, he did not understand ""Jazz,"" why on earth did he assay an attempt to ""analyze"" it. I think Oprah could have done a better job!!!"
1,Disappointed,With the hope to identify foundation trusts in Hong Kong to seek possible funding of my charitable organization. But it is rather disappointing to find out that the book only mentions a government department that has such a list. After searching the list that there are only the names of all the charitable organizations but no specific nature of what kind of charitable organizations they are. The book title is misleading to identify the prospect. The book is expensive and not helpful at all.David
3,A light read,These novellas are light and easy to read. It's a good book to curl up with when you don't want a complicated and adventurous story. The novellas are emotionally driven and the characters are well-developed. The stories are wholesome and there's an inspirational message woven within each story. I'd recommend this book to all who like a light Christian romance story.
4,Still Magic,"When you listen to Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares you feel like you are in some place else rather then Earth. This is a very good album with the same quality of the first one, which was a superb CD. The second one still brings you the angelical voices of these incredible women. The voice of Yanka Roupkina set up a standart in the frist one (third track, Kalimankou Denkou). If you liked the first one you certainly will like the second."
4,Enchanting and haunting vocal music,"I knew very little about the Bulgarian State TV and Radio Womens hoir until I heard a short clip of di-li do on the radio. I was intrigued and decided to buy a CD to see if I would like more of their music. Lo and behold the CD arrived and went straight into the CD-player. I was enchanted with the sometimes haunting music. In some cases it can be dissonant (my wife's reaction was ""What the heck is that"") but it draws you in. Not all of the tracks are great but some are amazing di-li do in particular. My music collection features a range of less conventional music such as Kodo, modern organ music, Russian liturgy, and so on and so on. This fits right in. It's odd how traditional musical styles can fit with a modern classical music sensibility. I recommend this highly but do advise listening to some of the 30 second clips if you are unsure. Once you get hooked though this is compelling. I willl buy more of the oeuvre in the future."
3,"Some material transcends, some reiterates narrow confines","3 1/2Carter is said to be one of the important modern American classical composers, but I agree with the previous reviewer who finds the first half far superior to the latter. These three works obviously have much in common with some of the sporadic, atonal sentiment which dominates current compositions, almost always to the detriment of the music. We do see that generically rampant, neo-classical ""sketching"" throughout the Double Concerto, but Carter's 2 Sonatas on the disc push past a compositional void that nearly curses the entire genre. Although the schizophrenic nature remains intact, these sonatas are gently layered with a musicality that gives form to an often formless gesture."
5,Street Fighter 2 V Vol.6 ROCKED!,"I loved this video because I'm a big Street Fighter fan. The Good Guys in this video (Ken, Ryu, and Chun-Li)rocked! And the villians (Vega, Bison, Balrog, and Cammy) hey I even loved the villians! If you like to see action watch this video!!"
2,Get the original instead.,"The fight between Vega(balrog in Japanese) and Ken were great in the Jap version. In the american dubbed one, they sound like high pitch people who are like surfer dudes and such. Whats worse *spoiler* when Ken gives the Shoryuken to Vega it sounds so retarded. In the Jap version, he sounds truly like a fierce rising dragon. Another bad thing is that the american dubbing will annoy the hell out of you with scenes like Bison(vega in Jap) choking Chun-Li. Whatever you do, just get the original version. American Version is not worth it."
5,IT WAS PACKAGE GOOD. IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE FRAGRANCES.,Halston By Halston For Women. Set-cologne Spray 3.4 Ounces & Body Lotion 4.2 Ounces
4,Hello... Where are the other two books.,"I enjoyed this story, it had some uncomfortable monents but I still enjoyed it. I have been waiting for the rest of the ""Mayflower Trilogy"" for all the years since. What's up with that?"
4,*****I want more**** Give me more!,"This is a cool book. It is funny. It is intriguing. It will make a wonderful series...if Orson evers writes another one!I read all the Earthborn, Earthclan, etc. books.This can be another great series!Don't keep your fans waiting too long, Orson!"
4,Thought provoking but uneven,"A thought provoking look at slavery and small town life on a colony ship. It has a appealing narrator, Lovelock, a sentient capuchin monkey, who acts as a prominent scientist's ""witness"". He has an unique prospective that keeps you interested.The major flaw is the portrayal of life on a spaceship. So many of the supporting characters are unsympathetic and unlikable busybodies. It seems more like life in a small town in the 1940's, before television, when all there was to do was gossip. I would think that there would be a level of sophistication that is lacking in the supporting cast.I understand that Ms. Kidd doesn't usually write science-fiction, but writes stories about small town life. It shows.I had no problem with the open-endedness of the novel, that the professional reviewer did. After all, it says ""Book 1 of the Mayflower Trilogy right on the cover! No one criticized ""Fellowship of the Ring"" for being open-ended."
2,not worth it,"I really like Orson Scott Card, and all his other stuff ranges from good to great. However, this is one of the two or three exceptions.The book is essentially about a super-intelligent monkey who is trying to get laid. That's it. There really isn't anything more to this book than a monkey and his quest for sex (in outer space).I mean, I've read books that are worse, but not a whole lot of them. Save your money for something entertaining, like anything from the Ender's series. =-)"
2,Terrible,"How much fixation on sex do we need? Yes there were some interesting spots, but the book was so revolting I almost didn't finish."
1,"Terrible, load of rubbish","Very poorly realised and I will not be hanging out for the rest of the trilogy. Kiddy space opera at its worst, nothing to grab an adult reader."
2,A capuchin is a person,"Let's say you were an Enhanced Capuchin. You had all of the intelligence of a human, more, but all of the emotional and psychological properties of a capuchin. You have been conditioned not to do the unseemly things capuchins do. But never fear, you can conquer this and, as a culmination of your growth, successfully masturbate. This book is no more than a tool to put dirty ideas in the mind of readers, from a unique standpoint, a monkey. This book has no value, it is essentially a story of a monkey who wants to be sexually free, with himself and everyone else, even going to the effort of growing a wife for himself. Welcome to the twisted mind of Orson Scott Card, I can only say that I am happy OSC has mellowed his writing in his old age, and am glad that he has redeeming books such as the Ender's saga. Sorry OSC, I like to think of you as the inspiration for my writing efforts, but some of your books are nothing to be proud of."
4,I'll have to read it again by the time the second comes out!,"Well I read this book not long after it came out so I have to go from memory. But as I recall I devoured it. It was very standard card. I'd have probably given it 5 stars but I'm kinda miffed that I read the book in like 95 or 96 and here it is almost 2000 and they haven't written the second. The person who whined about the book being offensive is being a bit puritanical in my view. Especially in how sexuality is used in the book, secondly its a monkey and well monkeys are well...monkeys. The comment that this is kiddy sci fi I believe was a bit unjustified, the book is not for a non-sci-fi or fantasy reader. I'd say it incorporates elements of both. Secondly it requires you to put yourself into the moral issues. The characters aren't flat and uncomplicated like your run of the mill StarTrek book"
3,A fairly good space opera,"The story reads well and remains interesting all the way to the end. There are no real cliff hangers although there is a little mystery about who is going to get murdered before the end of the novel. The story is told in diary form accounts written after most of the action in the story has occurred. The monkey talks about a murder that he has committed. There are a lot of dysfunctional people in the story at times any of them seems to be a good candidate for being murdered. It is actually these strongly annoying characters that made the story for me, they are well portrayed by the authors.The technology part of the story doesn't always quite hold together especially if you know even a little bit about computer science. And the tech. is dated a little as well since the story was published way back in 1994."
5,An entertaining story from and unusual point of view,The collaborative effort by Orson Scott Card and Kathryn Kiddproduced a fun and imaginative book. Written from the unusual pointof view as a story in the fist person of one of the characters.Card's style of character development and is quite evident. Althoughsome of the characters remind me a bit too much like charactersin an earlier novel. The humor of Lovelock's point of view is obviouslycreated by Kathryn Kidd. I feel that this is a strong collaborativeeffort and the framwork is picked up by other authors.
2,Not what I expected,"This book may be helpful for some communities, but I found it disappointing. The prayers have a very modern translation and the wording is not what I expected. This books does not have the prayers written in the standard or traditional way, the author instead re-translated the prayers in both languages to a modern way of speaking making the prayers unfamiliar to both languages. Being myself bilingual I have learned prayers in the traditional way and I can't use this book. I think is my fault for not reading through the book before buying it.The reason why I don't give this book less stars is because it has a very good format, is easy to read and is full of illustrations."
5,Good book,Good book for either someone that wants to learn the prayers in english or spanish or for someone that just needs a refresher. Left page as the english version and the right page has the spanish version. I really like this format. Allows you to see/learn the other language while reading it.
5,Shuttle-Craft Book of American Hand-Weaving,"Mary Atwater was one of the greatest ""explainers"" of weaving. She created many drafts and beautiful designs, and worked out drafts for historic coverlets with step by step ""recipes"" for creating them. This is a lovely little book, full of information about setting up the loom, comparisons of loom types and drafting differences in other countries. Her hand lettered instructions are beautifully done and there are lots of black and white pictures and other illustrations. Mary also addresses weavers' knots and finishes. This is a really delightful and comprehensive book for it's time."
2,Horrible,I have a V260 so I got one of these cases and when i put it on my phone it wouldn't even shut thats how small it was. When i did gett it on I had to pull so hard that the cover for the screen was completely bent and started getting ripped off the leather. The only reason why it got a two star rating was because it helped prevent a few scratches. If you want a good leather cases go to verizonwireless.com and buy one from there.
2,Inconsistent Fat Measure - Avoid It,"I'm usually very good about reading reviews before buying. Unfortunately I read Consumer Reports before buying and not these reviews. While Consumer Reports rated it the best measurer of fat among those tested they did say it still had shortcomings but nothing like the ones experienced by the reviewers here or by me. Following the instructions I tested the machine out four times in twelve minutes. The weight reading was consistent but the four body fat readings I received were 20%, 21%, 24% and 24%. I can assure you I did not down a pizza in those twelve minutes. I am resigned to the fact that these machines are not accurate, I would take a water test for that. But I did expect consistency so that you could measure fat LOSS accurately, for that all you need is a machine to consistently give you the same error with each reading. Even that is too much to expect I guess. Back to the pinch test for me."
2,Not Accurate,"I've been mostly just using this as a plain scale, not bothering much with the body fat portion yet, and it's horrible. I can step on the scale several times in a row and have my weight vary by as much as 8 lbs! If I was planning on GUESSING what my weight was, I wouldn't have purchased a scale to begin with!"
1,I wish!,"WEll, Consumer Reports got me to buy this model.Tested it out, myself and partner.My BF %, eath time, two days, 7.5%!I may be in good shape, but NOT that good...."
1,wildlife: the bald eagle,The effects of this movie are so old and out of date. The information is not as indepth as described.
2,Expected better,"Luther, get well soon so you can make another CD. This is below average music. I know that you can do better. Here is the grade breakdown of this project:""IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER"" - C""THINK ABOUT YOU"" - A""IF IT AIN'T ONE THING"" - D""BUY ME A ROSE"" - C""THE CLOSER I GET TO YOU"" - A""LOVELY DAY"" - F (Bill Withers original version is so much better.)""DANCE WITH MY FATHER"" - C""SHE SAW YOU"" - B""APOLOGIZE"" - C""HIT IT AGAIN"" - D""RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE"" - C""ONCE WERE LOVERS"" - C""LOVELY DAY"" Part 2 - F""THEY SAID YOU NEEDED ME"" - A"
5,Thank you Luther!,This is worth it just for the song Dance With My Father.Luther Vandross will be remembered as a great singer.
2,"Not Quite ""Luther""","This cd gets two stars because it's Luther, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. After hearing ""Dance With My Father"" on the radio, I was eagerly awaiting the release. But it seems as though I fell for the old ""bait and switch"". The guest artists were ridiculous; they brought absoutely nothing to the cd; the duet with Beyonce is laughable...her voice sounds weak and it doesn't mix well with Luther's. He should have chosen someone with a better voice (Heather Headley for example) to sing with him.Overall, I was terribly disappointed with this album. If you like Luther's older and more substantial work don't bother with this cd.He is still one of the greatest though :)"
3,it's ok,"a couple of good songs. luther's career was drying up until this cd and his death put him back on the map. i was expecting more and got only dancing with my father and buy me a rose. the duet with beyonce was good too. the rest of the cd was filler. save your money, this cd will be on the preowned cd racks in a few months"
5,Brilliant,"Quite possibly Mr. Vandross' best work ever! Every track is well worth listening to (several times). I was not particularly thrilled with listening to Foxy Brown on ""If it ain't one thing"". Thankfully, most of her ramblings came at the end...smooth and coarse just do not blend very well. I was very pleasantly surprised at ""Hit it Again"". Sexy, very sexy. Did it need the Queen? No! Mr. Vandross was doing great all by himself on this one!Ms. Knowles handled herself very well with a music legend! Maybe she is not all flash after all....great rendition of ""The closer I get to you"".Mr. Vandross has been so consistent for so many years that we all expect the very best from him. He has raised the bar yet again with this album and I am excited to see his follow-up! Yes, I live in an optimistic world and I fully expect another Vandross CD in 2005. Unquestionably this is a must have CD. He hits the mark with every track!Je t'aime, Luther.G"
4,Dance with my father,"Damn good album, nice playing quietly in the back ground. beautiful voice, purchased for the song ""Dance With My Father"" I wasn't disappointed.Dance With My Father"
3,Think About You,"That's the cut on this one...#2. Right up there with the Luther classics. Wish the whole album was up there. The rap stuff ruins the album. I'd rather listen to Luther classic compilations...with ""So Amazing"", ""Any Love"", and other untouchable vintage Luther songs. One of his BEST albums is ""Your Secret Love""...no rap, just LU...major league. GET BETTER LUTHER. We love you."
4,Nice Album,"Luther just has this unbelievable voice sent from God coming straight from his heart,his beautiful soul coming through most of his songs.Now the reason I gave the album four stars is because the trendy songs were not good, but the true luther songs like ,""Think about you"", ""Buy me a rose"",""Dance with my father"" and the song he did with Beyonce'""The Closer I get to you"" were outstanding,these songs alone should be the reason you buy this album.I just was not feeling the trendy songs that had busta rhymes,foxy brown and Queen latifah,it was just out of his sync,Luther is at the top of songs that you know only god could have touched his voice and soul to sing with such an unbelieavable voice. I love you luther and I thank you for the songs you have made now and in the past that has touched mine and and other people hearts all over. THANK_YOU"
4,Buy me a Rose,"Although I agree the first hit will be Dance with My Father, I feel in the ballad ""Buy me a Rose"" Luther has captured the essence of dating in the year 2000. ""Buy me a Rose"" shows how far off track people are in what is asked for in a relationship and what truly is needed in a relationship. You often hear a partner say I want diamonds, pearls etc. But their heart needs love,devotion and timeshare. A truly great ballad that will rank with ballads such as ""A house is not a home"" others that make your heart yearn."
3,The Velvet Voice of Soul Is Back...,"The velvet-voice of soul is back effectively exploring such romantic situations as questioning a ""friend's"" intentions (""If I Didn't Know Better""), expressing the pleasures in simple things (""Buy Me A Rose"", a soulful remake of Kenny' Rogers comeback hit a few years ago), warning a male friend about his cheating ways (""She Saw You""), and even flipping the script on the ""Although I'm poor, I can give you more love than that rich guy you're dating"" situation (""Apoligize"", the album's best cut beside the touching title track). Guest Beyonce Knowles helps Luther turn the old Roberta Flack/Donny Hathaway hit ""The Closer I Get To You"" into a vocal tour-de-force. However, rappers Busta Rhymes, Queen Latifah and Foxy Brown get in Luther's way on ""Lovely Day"" (an unremarkable hip-hoppish remake of the old Bill Withers song), ""Hit It Again"" and ""If It Ain't One Thing It's Another"". Luther doesn't need guest rappers to sell records."
3,"Get rid of the rap crap, PLEASE!","Although the title track alone is worth the price of the CD (well, almost) and some of the other ballads show off Luther's prowess to be the silkiest voice in R&B today, everything gets ruined when he starts enlisting some modern day rappers into the mix (Queen Latifah, Foxy Brown, Busta Rhymes). These rap sessions are totally useless, uncalled for, and just don't add anything to the otherwise fine songs. Very disappointing CD. Luther, I hope you continue to feel better so that you'll have the oppurtunity to make a better CD next time."
2,Huge amount of filler!,"Why are people giving this CD such great reviews? I like Luther Vandross (along with the other soul greats like Stevie Wonder, Marven Gaye and Barry White) but most of this album is so boring Im glad I didnt buy it! The only listenable songs are: Think About You, Dance With My Father and If I Didnt Know Better. This CD DESERVED to be slept on. I know Luther is capable of better. It just got hype because of his hospitalization. Hopefully he will release a CD with more than just good singles. D-"
1,Not his best work!,"This album is just plain bad! I can't believe he even put it out. His voice is still dynamic and wonderful, but the songs chosen for this album are horrific. I was very very disappointed and was happy to give my CD away to a friend, but she didn't like it either. I hope he has a recovery with his health, but I also hope he puts out a better album next time! Not very good this time Luther."
2,Keepin it Real,I anxiously awaited the release of this album but was so disappointed when I purchased. I have listened to this twice since I purchased in hopes that I wasn't in a Luther frame of mind at first connection. Time has passed and I feel even more that this is the worst CD he has put out. I have all the respect for Luther and his past work but this was a waste of music entertainment dollar. Burn it don't buy it
2,Just one song stands out.Majority Rules.,"I'm a typical Luther Fan.I wish him a speedy recovery,your true fans love you.The fact is,this rapper-rich CD is a disappointment.The producer responsible 4 this should be denied a second chance to work with Luther.True fans would buy this CD simply to show support to Luther.However,If you're on a strict budget,such as I,just procure a 99 cent download of the duet withBeyonce,it's classic stuff with a modern-day groove.Trash the rest.This review is in line with the others.Majority Rules.Love you Luther."
5,I loved it,When I first heard this song I absolutly loved it. It was a tear jerker. Just the words a lone. Beautiful job. Luther you did great. I would definetly recommend this cd.
3,SO SO CD,"I must say I like the song ""Dance with my Father"" not just that so many can relate to the song but it is a very touching, moving, heart-felt song. I love when an artist can take all the feelings he has and draw them out into a song that is so reflective. That song probably sells the cd.I am not a Luther fan, however I have heard the cd and I do think the best songs on the cd are the collaboration - ""The Closer I Get To You"" duet with Beyonce, as well as ""Lovely Day"", and the ""Buy Me A Rose"" cover, never liked Kenny Rogers. There are equal amounts of slow and faster upbeat songs to get you through the cd. Older fans might not like the Busta Rhymes/rap hip hop flare on a few of the songs."
5,Heaven sent,"As a true Luther fan and a lover of his delivery of songs, I am impressed by this CD. Luther seems to have thought to capture a wide-ranged base of music lovers. His duet with Beyonce, The Closer I Get To You, should just be a number one hit. You can't play it just once. Luther has the ability to bring out the best in someone's voice and he certainly achieved this with Beyonce. In the song, Lovely Day, you really get to appreciate the range in Luther's voice. He actually sounds as if he is a one-man singing group who changes registers so gracefully. One man with so much talent is just heaven sent. They Said You Needed Me is awesome - I do need Luther. I can't even speak about Dance with My Father. I get all choked up. HE IS THE KING!!!"
4,Luther's Best CD Since 1991,"Finally a good CD from Luther Vandross. He hasn't had a good CD since 1991. I had not bought a Luther CD in years. I was pleasantly suprised by this one. Hopefully he will have a full recovery, give us more good music and tour again."
3,Luther Can Do It All By Himself,"For the record...I love Luther Vandross, I faithfully attend ""all"" of his concerts when he's in Philly or at the Jazz Festivals in New Orleans or Virginia and I have most of his music, but I am a little disappointed with his last CD: Dance with My Father.Although I do love a few of the songs that are done by Luther alone, the collabortions with the artists chosen on some of the songs were mismatched in my opinion..so much so that I am not buying this CD..."
3,A so-so effort,"I have every Luther CD, except the ""Best of"" ones, so I know of which I speak. This is a mediocre effort, not his worst but no where near his best. The worst songs are the ones with rappers: Foxy, Busta, and Latifah. Luther, baby, no ones buys your CDs to hear rappers or hip hop. If I want Busta, I'll buy Busta. I buy Luther to listen to smooth ballads, one after the other, flowing from the first to the last. Well, that's not this album. It's too disjointed and sounds as if it were quickly put together. There are, however, some gems. The Beyonce duet is quite nice, but there are no vintage Luther songs here. But, ya gotta buy it 'cause it's Luther."
2,Can't Improve on The Best,"I love Luther. Add Rapper and Hip Hoppers to Luther and they just don't mix. Luther's smooth, loving, soft, caressing ballads are what I'm looking for; not the abrasive style of the street. I like two songs - Send Me a Rose and Dance with my Father - the rest, I will never listen to again.Luther Vandross is THE BEST all by himself."
2,Would Like More of Dance With My Father,"I bought the album thinking most of the tracks would be like Dance With My Father. Unfortunately, that was the only stand out ballid. It's a beautiful song and most likely the best slower song of 2003. The rest of the album left me luke warm. For instance, the Foxy Brown duet was simply unbelievable. Also, the background vocals on most the tracks were just silly. The writing on this album overall was pretty weak. One other song that I liked was Hit It Again with Queen Latifan. She's on a roll with Chicago, Bringing Down the House and this track. Luther has an incredible voice and that's not a question in my mind. I wish Luther improved health and still willing to go out and buy his next album."
2,"I can't believe it ! Anodyne ,over-produced mix !","You can trace a slick line from Luther to current chart-botherersR.Kelly and Usher.Smooth operators all,but Luther is the daddy of them,which is probably why the likes of Foxy Brown,Beyonce Knowles and Queen Latifah have queued up to be his ladeez on this album,adding some hip star credentials,if not exactly gallons of personality to the anodyne,over-produced mix.DANCE WITH MY FATHER is so laidback and uninvolving that a merely reasonable cover of Bill Withers' LOVELY DAY, with superfluous contributions from Busta Rhymes,stands out against the rest of the album's somnambulant soul offerings.With Luther still fighting to recover from a serious stroke,it is possible that this indifferent collection could be his swansong.That would be a shame and a waste."
3,re-make,"I didn't hear the entire CD as of yet. I am still waiting for my order to come in from amazon.com. On my way home the other night I heard ""The Closer I Get To You"" by Luther and Beyonce. I must say I don't particularly like re-makes, but this one took my breath away! It was that beautiful and the spin they put on at the end of the song is wonderful!"
3,COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I have always enjoyed Luther's music,but I must admit that I haven't listened to him in years.After he had a stoke I decided to purchase his latest cd.What disappointed me was the addition of rap artist.I don't care for rap artist to much unless they wrap all positive lyrics.I am use to Luther singing some of the greatest love ballots ever sung by a vocalist.The addition of rap artist just took away from Luther's style.Some of the songs that Luther sings without the rap artist are ok.Dance with my father is a beautiful song and maybe one other song on the album is really nice but overall the album is just ok and could have been better.This is not your typical Luther Vandross album.I do recommend this cd because it could turn out to be the very last cd that Luther ever makes and that can make this cd a classic.So if nothig esle,buy it for that reason."
5,How I Feel About The Product,I loved the Dance with my father CD It is lovely. Each time i listen to the song I want to cry all over again.I would tell every one about it.
5,The man with the golden voice,"Love this man's honey, silky coated voice. Dance With My Father features some classic LV jams...""Think About You"", ""Buy Me a Rose"", the remake ""The Closer I Get to You"" which are my particular favorites. It's not that I don't enjoy the entire CD the above-mentioned are the standouts. Luther DOES NOT need to insert rap into his recordings...he is a singer's singer!Get well soon Luther!"
3,His Vocals Carry this Set as usual since the 90's,back in the 80's Luther had Words&Music to go along with His VOice but since the 90's it's been all Voice&Hit&Miss Music&Words&that is the case with this Album.Praying for Luther&Wishing Him a Fully Recovery.Musically speaking though the title track stands out for me but the Duets don't work at all for me.I Miss Luther Albums that had depth to them.this is another slick Clive Davis Production which covers alot of Shine&Polish but lacks any real Sparks to Match Luther's Range.
2,Sorry Luther,"I was never a big Luther fan. But I did appreciate some of his songs such as Only Human,Endless Love,House is not a Home. I thought they were meaningful and beautiful. But Luther pathetic attempt to cross over to hip hop was laughable at best. This CD had the potential to be good but alas it wasn't."
5,Luther DID his homework!,"I had the opportunity of listening to ""If I didn't know better"", and I could not move on to track 2. That song is one of Luther's finest recordings. Luther can master the art of being as soulful as possible without oversinging. He and his family are on my prayers for a full and speedy recovery. I'd like to thank him for making this world a better place through song."
2,Easy to forget songs,"I'm sure my review will cause a ruckus, but this is a very poor cd from a very wonderful singer. Neither the lyrics nor the music are memorable. When the music stops, you can't even remember what had just played or who was singing.I'm afraid too many of his fans are giving Mr. Vandross ""pity points"" because of his current health problems. I won't. This cd seems to have been tossed out as a nugget to keep fans hanging on until Mr. Vandross' health improves completely and he can get back to some serious singing.No artist should be so complacent that he/she believes any offering is good enough for the listening public, and the listening public shouldn't accept mediocrity because prior albums were a hit.Pick another cd by this performer and take a pass on this one."
5,R.I.P. Luther - you're at peace now,"This was Luther's final studio album and he couldn't have ended his career with a more appropriate collection of good music. Dance With My Father is one of Luther's most personal albums and we have been so blessed over the years to have the pleasure of listening to his rich, melodic vocals. He was an immensely talented songwriter, arranger and producer as well. Luther, you will always be one of the jewels in our crown. May you rest in peace with the Lord and enjoy the eternal Dance With Your Father."
5,Dance With My Father,"I could use 1,000 words, but since I feel I can get to the point in far less I'll go that route. Luther Vandross has always been one of my favorite entertainers, and he still is. However, this CD has got to be some of his best work by far. It is one of those CD's you can listen to over and over again (and never get tired of it). I pray, this isn't his last but God forbid that is the case,,,He certainly has left us with a great one! My prayer is he'll be back, and I believe in miracles. You really did it Luther,,,once again."
4,A PESAR DEL TIEMPO,"A pesar que el tiempo y en este caso su movilidad de parte de Henry, uno de los protagonistas, puede reportarle algunos beneficios, la mayoria son contratiempos y dificultades. El hecho de que sea Clare la que espera y añora el regreso del amado en una manera distinta de presentar lo que a traves de la historia se ha dado, en donde el cazador va hacia lo desconocido con tal de procurar el sustento, aqui el cazador va hacia distintas epocas para armar un rompecabezas emocional y sera la abandonada quien tendra la fortaleza de seguir adelante.Con un lenguaje cautivante en su dualidad femenina y masculina, muy original y cuando uno se acostumbra a esto y a los cambios de fecha, te atrapa."
1,La mujer del viajero en el tiempo,La mujer del viajero en el tiempo/ The Time Traveler's Wife (Spanish Edition)I would like to see inside this book. thanks. Luz Rivera
3,shocked to know officers were not punished if they refused,"Good old days is an historical account of wittnesses inside the einsatzgruppen murders of jews.it was not hard to understand that most of the men doing the shooting got sick to the point of having to get drunk to forget.what i DID find shocking was that many of these wittnesses told that if they refused to shoot jews, they were assigned to another job...it was not 'following orders', or the fact that they either did this job or they were punished severly.... not true. simply, they all could have, had they chosen to, not do the job of shooting jews by massacaring them as they dug their own graves.....the soldiers tell their stories, in their own words...a riviting account of the 'good old days''i recommend this book to anyone studying nazi history, and those who want the truth instead of propaganda."
3,a dificult read,This book is depressing and very difficult to read for very long. The benefit of the book is to get a first hand glimpse of the atrocities committed by those following Hitler in WWII. It outlines how savage people can become in their feelings toward a religion.
2,Problem with Seller Smartlife Online,"I ordered this as a gift, which unfortunately I ended up needing to return. I've been emailing the seller Smartlife Online for over a month but have not received a single reply."
4,Nice background music,Relaxing classical music. Beautiful nature scenes. Some of the video seems a little grainy for blu-ray and some wierd color enhancing on others. Overall a great disk to have on for some nice background music/ video.
3,"Great Music, Poor HD Video Quality","This Blu-Ray contains a very nice cross section of popular classical music. The music quality is good; however, the 1080i HD video quality is grainy. There is a choice of 5.q PCM vs Dolby but no 2-channel PCM which would have been desirable."
3,Pleasant,"Very nice music, scenery is OK but not as exciting as I was led to belive. Well worth the price."
2,1080I ?,"Why buy a bluray disk with only 1080i? I was somewhat disappointed in the quality as I thought I was buying a 1080p disk. It was my own fault, but anyone interested in this might enjoy many other great bluray nature titles that are even less expensive than this one."
3,This was pretty boring...,"I purchased this because the price was quite low at around seven bucks...but now I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it because it's pretty boring to watch and I didn't think that the scenes were that impressive either. One of the scenes was a slow, very slow, panning out of a waterfall...I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit around watching this. Clearly this is meant to be played in the background while you're doing something else...but if that's the case, wouldn't a CD suffice?"
1,Do not order,"Place disc in DVD player and got the message ""bad disc"". Now I have the hassle of returning a useless DVD. Do not order you will be disappointed."
4,Party Attraction,"I ordered this dvd to play on our big screen during parties or dinners for four in our home. Nice. I like that we have the option of scenes with music or scenes without music. The only 2 improvements I would make are: The music title is captioned but the scene is not, so you do not know the what and where of the scenes. Also, it is not continuous loop, so you have to restart it every 78 minutes."
2,Duplication Natures Colors,"I am a big fan of the the HD Environment series and was looking to expand my library of digital videos. I found Nature's Colors online and decided to buy it based on very good reviews. Once I received the DVD and played it I was disappointed to see that most of the content was just a repackaged version of HD Environments material set to non copyrighted music. Though the material and music were ok, I just want to warn buyers if you have the HD Environment series dont buy this DVD as most of it you will already have. I am giving my copy away as a Christmas gift to someone who has neither."
5,My First Bluray expereince!,this disc is a must have for anyone who just jumped to Bluray. The quality is breathtaking. I really could not believe my eyes. The content was not being played on even an HDMI CONNECTION AND YET IT WAS BRILLIANT. I was playing it on a DELL 24'' panel via component cables. The images and video was simply amazing and sound on 2.1 ch. was just as good. I am still building my HD Universe and this disc takes the cake
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed most aspects of this Blu-Ray disk. The scenery is indeed natural and colorful, but I felt disappointed in my purchase after the first 10 minutes. The scenery was not varied enough, and there are too many scenes of trees, water and common wildlife that I could video myself by talking a walk in a nearby woods. I was expecting more scenery from unusual places around the world. The quality of the music track is fantastic, especially on my high-end home theater. Once again, too many of the selections are classical music that I've heard countless times on television, movies, radio, etc. Something surprising and new would have gone a long way here."
3,An inferior copy of Living Landscapes HD?,"I ordered and got both Nature's Colors and Living Landscapes HD The World's Most Beautiful Places [Blu-ray], hoping to enjoy the nature's beauty from different perspectives... BUT, after first seeing the 'Living Landscapes' and trying 'Nature's Colors', I am to...ooo much surprised to found that both copies shared a lot of common footage of almost all scenes! What the hell...Who actually owns the copyright? Why are they published by different companies?Well anyway, frankly speaking, the background music (noise?) of the Living Landscapes are all too artificial. Nevertheless, the picture quality is much better than Nature's Color when I am just 'giving' the chance to compare both."
3,Nature scenes set to classical music,"This video contains scenes from the folks at HDenvironments.com, makers of the Living Landscapes videos. They add classical music instead of retaining the natural sounds. The calssical selections are popular ones you should recognize, and the movement from scene to scene is faster than the original Living Landscapes videos. If this appeals to you, enjoy. If you want the natural sounds and longer scenes are each site, get the original Living Landscapes videos."
4,Good quality and picture,"The movie had a fine picture and no glitches. However, this particular version is missing the opening scene in which Joan is born, and the ending scene in which Jean returns to Joan's family to return her banner. Other than the lack of those scenes I enjoyed the movie."
1,Not the full length original,"I was very disappointed after viewing this current DVD release. I have seen this version of Joan of Arc with Leelee Sobieski before and wanted another copy. This is, in my opinion, the best movie of Joan of Arc even though it's not the most historically accurate. But this DVD is not the full length original movie. A lot was edited out in this copy. The original film had a run time of 180 minutes...this recent copy they have released is but 102 minutes. That's a lot of missing scenes, especially if you are not familiar with the story of Joan of Arc."
3,A SHAME FOR MERCURY LABEL/RECORDS...MISSING THE BEST SONGS FROM THE ORIGINAL ALBUM..!,"GYPSY, JULY MORNING AND MEDLEY ARE THE BEST SONGS THAT MAKE THIS ALBUM SPECIAL AND UNIQUE, AND THEY ARE NOT IN THIS CD.I WONDER WHY THE CD DOES NOT HAVE ALL THE SONGS AS IN THE LP.THIS LP IS A CLASSIC FROM 1973 AND ONE OF THE BEST LIVE CONCERTS EVER..!"
3,Only for extreme die-hard Heepers,"I'll keep this short and right to the point - The band sounds sloppy on this disc. None of the songs are better than their studio counterparts, and in many cases are worst. For example, July Morning is slow and lethargic compared to the studio version on Look At Yourself, and doesn't have the atmosphere and mood of the original Moog synthesizer part.This sounds too much like a bootleg. BUY THE STUDIO ALBUMS!"
4,"Wow! I'm reliving my glory days....""Sweet Lorraine""","I bought this album when I was 13, at the advice of my older brother. It was powerful music at a time when music was shifting from hard rock to glitter rock,...Queen with an Edge. Check it out!"
2,Missing a great track,"I love Uriah Heep and this album was awesome, but the CD version is missing the ""Rock n Roll Medley"" track that I foolishly didn't notice was not listed when I ordered it. If you don't mind that one track missing, the rest of the CD is great. For me, I liked that medley a lot. It was on the album, it should have been included on the CD."
3,"Ok, but not the best","I first learned OE from Bright's over 20 yrs ago now.Compared to the texts I used for learned classical languages, it definately left something to be desired in its method of grammar presentation. He should have spelled out the paradigms more explicitly than using a tilde so much, and combining Nom/Acc cases all the time. I learned Latin/Greek/Hebrew by rote memorization as most Classicists do. Give me the full chart so I can see/say the inflections !I highly recommend instead Mitchell and Robinson ""A Guide to Old English"". This is the book I recently relearned OE from after all of these years. Finally, I have an execellent understanding of Old English that I never had using Bright's."
1,**FIRE HAZARD** Do not buy!,"We've had this nice, adorable lamp for eight months. Over the last two days, the main light bulb part would flicker when turning on or off the lamp (like the bulb would burn out). However, this morning the part that the bulb screws into was smoking and flickering orange and we quickly unpluged it. The baby's room was filled with electrical smoke and my husband and I were sick to our stomachs thinking what might have happened if we had walked in fifteen minutes later while our baby was still asleep in there! Do yourself a favor and don't buy this lamp. Why would you ever put your child in a dangerous situation."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this lamp less than a year ago to replace my 3 yr. old's outlet night light. I liked the fact that it was a night light and could also be used as a lamp for softer lighting than the overhead ceiling fan lights. But, to my disappointment, the night light portion has ""died"" and now I am searching for a new lamp/night light. For the money, I had hoped it would last a least a couple of years!"
5,purepower dischord magic!,This is Guy and Brendan before Fugazi. Classic DC area punk. Not your standard 4 count snare-hi hat stuff. Offtime beats and great lyrics make this a true classic for any Dischord fan!
2,My ears are sore!,"My friend recommended the MAX wax ear plugs to me. At first these earplugs worked great. However after the 2nd day of wearing them I noticed my ears were tender and slightly sore. The wax ear plugs also get harder to roll in your finger as you use them again, so here I am at night giving all my finger strength to roll these wax ear plugs. Than when I think I have them rolled nice and small enough I start putting them around the ear canal (cuz your not supposed to shove them into your ear just cover the ear hole) and then I am like spackling them on and pushing on my already tender ears to get the wax to stick around the ears. Well ouch! after a while it hurts and your ears get sore, wax gets hard and by the way the wax will pick up dust, etc, cuz its on the sticky side.....Anyway it looks good on paper, but not in your ears. Try the other ear plugs the ones that are foam type, for me those seem the best so far."
3,The book has some value...,"... you're enjoy it more if you have a degree in math. It makes several interesting arguments why Drysdale and Rizzuto shouldn't be in the HOF. Nice discussion on the merits of Milt Pappas versus Drysdale. I never realized that the Veterans Committee had let in so many questionable candidates. Fortunately I think that the HOF has resolved that problem thanks largely to Joe Morgan's efforts (Thank you Joe!). I had heard the story on how Rick Ferrell got elected by the VC, maybe the least deserving member ever elected by the VC to the HOF. I had heard it was unanimous, but it was only 14 of 18 veterans who voted him in (blame Jim Campbell on this one)."
5,Knowledgeable stats man and quality analysis.,"This book is very thought provoking and honest.I love the way he analyzes players from different eras by using that eras stats to base his quality assessments on. Maybe not all hall of famers belong there, but the truth is statistics sure say a lot."
5,5 stars isn't enough,"This is an incredible book on love, life and the unfairness and stupidity of history. And cats fascination with tuna. I don't often get emotional when reading a book, although a good movie can bring me to tears if well done. This book made me cry with happiness, with anger and it made me laugh out loud and smile one heckuva lot. I cannot recommend this book enough. Although this is the only book I have ever read by Ms. Dexter, I truly enjoyed it and look forward to other books by her. If this is the best she has ever done, well, that's fine, because this book is masterful."
5,Excellently written and intelligent piece of magical realism,"This delightful book follows a womans journey from fear and isolation to a very magical redemtion with the help of an oddly believable cast of empathic cats and a timeline of many lifetimes.Sensitively written elegantly paced, Dexters book offers a very personal view into a world as real as any we may dream for ourselves."
2,Doesn't look that nice on the counter,"I got this thinking that it would look nicer to put this over my mixer since it sits out on out counter, but I think it looks much nicer without the cover. The cover just makes it look like a big bulky cluttered thing sitting on your counter, but if you just have the mixer sitting there by itself, I think it looks nice. I guess its good for keeping dust off of the mixer, but we decided not to use it."
5,Love the colour and the functionality!,"Not only is the red a really rich, deep shade that stands out on the benchtop, the pocket is very handy and the quality of the manufacture suggests this cover will last a long time. I'm thrilled with it!"
5,Great stand mixer cover!,"While it's a shame to cover my red KitchenAid stand mixer, I don't mind it so much with this cover!The color is exactly as pictured. It looks great! Keeps mixer and bowl from getting dusty in between uses, and has a pocket on the outside that is great for holding different mixing attachements, recipes, or even mixing spoons."
4,Perfect gift,My sister got a Kitchen Aid mixer for Christmas and needed a cover. I gave her the cover to keep it clean. Perfect.
4,Not so much for the big mixers,"This Cloth Cover is great and made from a very good material, but it doesn't quite fit the 6 quart KitchenAid mixer it is a few inches short."
3,It's Useful BUT,"This cover fits over the Pro 600 BUT not all the way down. As another reviewer noted it's approximately 1"" shorter than the machine. Silly since KA puts their name to it. The material is easy to wash and durable. The side pockets should have a side flange and pocket cover to make it more practical for fitting accessories. Still it's a good piece to keep dust/grease out of the motor and bowl and I can make the needed adjustments myself. Even though I shouldn't have to..."
1,Cover does not fit crank up 5 quart classic mixer,"This cover does not fit my 38 year old classic 5 quart, crank up KA mixer. It is 2 or more inches short and looks awful. Strange, but KA must have changed the height and size of their mixers, because a new 5 quart KA I have in a second home has the identical cover (but in black) and the cover fits it perfectly and looks good.It seems the older mixers (same style and capacity) are larger than the present 5 quart ones. People have noted that it does not fit the 6 quart model.Amazon and KA need to stop saying the cover fits all KA mixers. It doesn't. By the way, the 38 year old one mixer works perfectly and always has. I'm returning the ill fitting cover. (The return process looks simple)"
5,Very Well Made!,"I put off getting this but am so glad I ordered it. My mixer will stay dust-free. And my kitchen has lots of red, so this is just right for me."
5,Great product!,My husband bought me a Kitchen Aide mixer for Christmas which I love! I wanted to keep it clean and this cover is just perfect. It can be put in the washer if needed and even has a little pocket in front if needed to store accessories/tools.
4,Kitchen Aid Mixer Cover,Kitchen Aid is again true to their quality - a very heavy duty mixer cover - even has a pocket for additional storage. The only improvement would be a availability in more colors.
5,TLC,"Beautiful, very well made and the color is awesome. This is a perfect fit for the KitchenAid Mixer. Thanks for great craftmanship! Highly recommend."
4,Nice cover at a good price,I love the rich red color of this cover. It fits perfectly over my mixer. The pocket on the outside fits the flat beater well. I wish it had a good place to put the dough hook but it's not a big deal--I just keep it inside the bowl. The price on Amazon was much cheaper than other websites.
5,Ktichenaid Stand Mixer Cover,I love this mixer cover - I owned it in White and just redecorated my kitchen so I order it in black. Very handy cover with a front slot for my mixer cookbook. Very handly plus it keeps my mixer dust free.
4,nice,The cover is just like the picture. It is nice. My only complaint is that it is somewhat small for the professional series mixers that have a bowl lift.
4,Fits Professional 6 qt Mixer,I was a little hesitant to buy because a review stated it doesn't fit the 6qt but others said it did... well it fit my 6qt professional model perfectly and looks great!
5,Stand Mixer Cover,What a great heavy duty cover to protect my new kitchenaid stand mixer. The pocket allows for alot of my kitchenaid attachments. Definately recommend this product.
5,kitchenaid cloth cover,This product is wonderful. It keeps my machine clean and dust free. The attractive red color is a great accent.
4,"Large, heavy-duty, and very red","I'll bet I've owned my Kitchenaid mixer for nearly 15 years and have always wanted a cover. In my all white kitchen, this is a major splash of color. It's quite well made, in fact thicker than necessary. It's a very substantial quilted kind of construction. That explains the cost. I'm happy with it."
5,KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cover,"It's very well made, as are most things KitchenAid makes. The side pocket is very convenient for storing the instruction manual and some favorite recipes, and the extra attachments."
4,Happy to find a red cover,"I purchased the KitchenAid stand mixer cover (Red) for a Christmas gift. I had tried several local department stores, but had no luck getting anything but black or white. My daughter-in-law was extremely pleased and surprised that I had found a red cover for her red mixer (she has several other KitchenAid appliances--all in red--and plans to continue with the red theme."
4,perfect fit,"Purchased for a Sunbeam 2371 and it fits perfectly. Has held up over the past year, stayed clean and kept dust off the mixer. Pocket for the attachments is nice."
4,nice but would have chosen another color,"This cover is , well made, the pocket is a good feature it is a little tight on my mixer I would choose another color as it attracts dust and is visible"
5,Great KitchenAid Mixer Cover with Pockets,"KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cover, Onyx Black. This is a very nice attractive cover that is washable! I ordered the red colored cover that would go with my black/red kitchen theme. It has wide pockets for my dough hook or a pocket for a set of stackable measuring cups. It is more attractive than just looking at the mixer and I would purchase it again in a flash! It is well made & I am very happy I bought it! I don't understand why people some people stated it doesn't fit. You must put the pouring spout inside the mixing bowl. It covers mine very nicely & I love looking at it instead of the white mixer. It also keeps everything inside nice & clean."
3,Good but not necessary,"Ordered this stand cover thinking to bring color into my kitchen, however I find I like the look of my Kitchenaid better without it! My stand is not the largest available, nor is the space it sits, and the cover seems to 'take over' and present as bigger and 'standing out' than I like - so, for me, less is more."
5,Pleasantly surprised with the quality,"This arrived and the quality was much nicer than I expected. Heavy fabric, great color and it fit perfectly over my bowl lift mixer."
2,didn't like it,cover didn't fit the way it looked in photo. Cover did not appear to be long enough to cover mixer completely and looked very bulky. I returned it. Mixer looks great without cover and I have it in a place where it will stay relatively clean without a cover.
4,Great little cover,This fits on our KitcheAid Artisan series stand mixer. The deep pocket to hold paddles and other accessories is a nice touch and the bright red cover is attractive and quite durable.
5,Looks good,Matches red in kitchen+Good quality material and construction+Fits with ample room for putting on and taking off without issue
2,Utilitarian cover,"Yes it covers my Kitchen Aid, but it is very heavy material that attracts every crumb, powdered sugar, cat hair in the air, etc. so it looks bad. My cheap toaster cover next to it looks much better."
2,NOT impressed!,Thankfully I paid a discount price for this because it's not the right height and the stitching is uneven; overall it was obviously sewn by a non-professional.I gave it two stars because it does 'cover' my stand mixer - but I'd say it's U G L Y !!!!!!To others.....I'd recommend being wary of ordering this item.
1,Smell like gas.,"Brand new, open the bag and has a strong small of gas. Don't even want that near the kitchen, I am going to return it."
1,Very disapointed!! Would not reccomend!!!!,I wanted to purchase a few items for my pro 600 kitchenaid ....this was one of of them. I was shocked to find the cover postively does not cover the unit. Another reviewer mentioned if you turn the cover to the side instead of pocket being in front as should be twist so pocket is on side of mixer. Although gives a little more give in length pulls cover so tightly making it look horrible.. Cannot believe this was designed for kitchen aid mixers without stating would only fit smaller kitchenaid smaller mixers. Feel as though I was decieved..False advertising!!!
2,ok cover,"Due to very compact kitchen I always store the bowl and splash guard on mixer. This cover will not come down over the splash guard; when splash guard removed covers the mixer and bowl very tightly, does not look good to me. Will return this and use the one I made myself again. Please note this is very well made, good quality material and sewing."
5,Great Cover,This cover fits my machine perfectly. I have washed it many times and it still looks great. The side pocket is useful for holding recipes and thin cookbooks.
4,Kitchen Aid- Cover,I purchased this item for my mother-in-law who was covering her kitchen aid mixer with a grocery sack. She was so pleased and was impressed with the quality of the item. I was also impressed with the quality and the price point.
3,Product was great until I washed it,"This cover worked as desired for my KitchenAid mixer until I washed it in the washing machine. It came out slightly mishappen and no longer completely covers the mixer. It still works ok, but isn't as attractive. Handwashing the cover might have prevented the problem and I will continue using it as is."
2,Not for a 5 quart mixer,Nice color but as with other comments it is about 1/2 inch to one inch way too short for a 5 qt mix. Okay but not great.
5,A good price for a funtional item,I bought a kitchenAid stand mixer for my wife for x-mas and I wanted to get her a cover for it too. After seaching different websites I found the best deal on Amazon.com. thanks Amazon.
5,KitchenAid Stand Mixer Cover,"This is a bright, attractive cover and replaces the colored towel previously used to keep the dust off the mixer."
4,Good buy,"I bought this at the same time when I got my mixer. I do not cook all the time. Since the mixer is kind of heavy, it gets let out on the counter all the time. The cover is definitely helpful to keep the dust out. Besides, the red is so pretty, it brightens up my white kitchen. It is well constructed and plenty room for the Artisan model."
5,A great product to have,"This is a well-made, attractive cover for our 570-watt KitchenAid. Fits right over the bowl and everything. Will keep it from getting dusty between uses, and is an attractive addition to our kitchen. Plus, it's maid by KitchenAid and has the little tag on it to that effect. A good bargain."
4,Durable and Smart,"I bought several of these for my child and others as gifts. My daughter is now two and loves to stack, read and chew on them, and, they're still around."
5,Excellent CD Single - Additional Live tracks make this CD,The Live Version of Boots of Spanish leather is phenomenal. If your a Dylan fan you need to have this CD Single in your collection.
5,It's Tight,This is an awsome album from rob van winkle. All of the songs are good I don't care who you are. We have got to realize that v-ice is one of the most talented White rappers ever.
3,The picture could be much better...,"We bought this after much research into under-cabinet tvs. It received an average of 4 and a half stars and the price was less than anything we had seen.When we got it in, we were not impressed with the picture quality. It is not a very crisp image..pretty fuzzy. The sound is not that great either."
1,don't buy,"Within two weeks, on the first unit we bought, the volume went away on the tv and the telephone, then the picture went black, then it wouldn't play any cd's or dvd's. We sent it back, ordered and received another unit. We've had it for four weeks. By now, the dvd won't eject the dvd (one of my favorites), and the telephone doesn't answer anymore. The one star I gave it is only because I had to put something down. Something is seriously wrong with the product. For us, it's been a piece of junk."
3,Hope It Lasts,"This unit is a great Idea for the kitchen. As for this manufacture I am not so sure. After having used it for about the first 25 days the picture went black. Amazon did an outstanding job with taking care of the situation. They sent me a new unitand sent me a postage paid label to return the damaged unit. if I purchased the unit locally I think I would have just taken it back and got my money back. I thought Audiovox was a good brand.I hope the replacement lasts for at least a couple of years. Amazon, Great Job. Thanks for making me happy."
1,Don't buy,I have sent this item back twice trying to get one that works. The first one had a broken DVD and the second one had a broken vertical hold.
2,Stay away from this !!!,"Screen went black in less than four months wanted me to pay to have it fixed, since they only offer a 90 day warranty."
2,Amazon warranty is awful; TV is moderate,"I purchased the TV and the 3-year warranty. The TV worked fine for 18 months then started making terrible noises, the picture sporatically went black, etc... So, I called the warranty company - five times - to no avail. One problem after another. So I called Amazon's customer service department - and after holding for 20 minutes - still, no avail. They were having their ""investigative team"" look into it and would send me a confirmation email as such. Big surprise -- never got the email. Amazon is too big to know - or care - much about customer service. But on the bright side - when I hung up with them, they told me to have a nice day. Now, that's worth the $425.00 I paid for a broken TV - right?"
3,"decent quality, low price","The unit functions well for tv viewing. However, the picture is only 7"", although the screen is 9"". Clear, crisp quality, especially when some feet away. Easy to read print on the screen. Easy to use remote or unit controls.Using mine on the counter. CD playing is sporadic; haven't tried a DVD.Overall, it fills the need for a kitchen tv."
1,"nice, until it dies","Really LOVED this unit and it's versatility. Made my tedious hours in the kitchen upbeat. I used it lightly a few months and then it went silent. The pic is still good, but what good is it when there is no sound? Needless to say, the CD, radio and MP3 are also useless without sound. I paid over 300 for this, about 100 a month. What a let down, after drilling all the holes in my cabinets to hang it."
3,DVD/TV Player,"We got it up and running. It works fine, but I really need the instructions. It didn't come with any. My husband says not to ever buy used electronics, and I believe him."
4,Tastes great and dissolves quickly without amping me up!,"I can't fully give a review as it hasn't been a month yet of me taking this. I will have a blood test at the end of the month to determine if I am absorbing this particular vitamin in this form, but in the meantime, it tastes good and doesn't amp me up which is what 50mg does of B-1."
5,It cost him his life,I felt I had to buy the book since Cicero finally took a stand for the principles expressed in his philosophical works and Marcus Antonius killed him in one of the purges.
5,Part of a Series,"In early 1998, Toshiba-EMI (now just EMI Japan) put together a budget series of greatest hits collections of most of the top selling Western and domestic acts in the catalogue. Genesis were a prime candidate. I found this somewhere with no obi (the paper strip with translations and such). Nothing new, of course.Only the Collins-Banks-Rutherford lineup are pictured since apparently they are recognised the most and dominate this collection. The following year, ""Turn It On Again: The Hits"" was released worldwide with most of the some tracks, and most recently, ""The Platinum Collection"". There wasn't an official collection like this prior to this.There aren't many English translations inside, so we'd have to find a programme that can scan and interpret Japanese text.For completists and casual fans alike.Released 28 March 1998 as Virgin VJCP 5105."
3,Satisfied,"This was a hardback book that was not new, which was ok with me, but the hardback cover/back is bent or warped quite a bit. It arrived in a timely fashion. I was happy to find this book and will continue to order ""Miss Read"" books.Barbara"
4,Thriller worth reading,"This book is a real page-turner. I think the combination of cutting edge information about genetic technology with the possibilites for biological warfare make this book a must read. The ramifications of what terrorists could do at any moment are scary, and the book really drives that point home. Buy it today."
5,a clear and easy to understand technical manual.,"Lets read the last part of that title again, ""Technical Manual"". While some people might consider the creativity or spirituality of photographs ""Technical"" I don't think that's what this book is supposed to be about. This book covers in detail techiques for improving image quality and technical problem solving. And it does a great job at it. The author doesn't get condescending or lose the average intelligence photographer with writing, and provides a valuable tool for improving photographs."
2,Dull technical review,"This is a mediocre book that presents a lot of loosely related technical facts but almost no link to the creative side of photography. For example, you learn how aperture affects depth of field but never really get a feel for why you would ever want to change depth of field and what creative control it gives you. The books is full of technical detail but is badly missing INSIGHT. Anyone serious about photography will get a lot more out of Ansel Adams trilogy (""The Camera"", ""The Negative"", ""The Print"") which is very inspirational and insightful."
2,Just O.K.,Good cinematography and somewhat interesting story; but mediocre dialogue and not very engaging. I would not recommend. This last sentence added just to hit the 20-word requirement for a review.
4,"not for young children, but well done with a very suprising storyline.",Very good and would recomend the watching of this movie and not for the reasons one might think educational as well as entereaining
5,The female perspective,"In attempting to understand and overcome the hypocrisy of a strong-willed woman who has no shame in exploring her sensuality, with no intention of inflicting emotional pain, this film captures such a moment. The central character is doing just that (what the conventional mind would applaud in a man but will condemn in a woman). The film makes a contribution to that alternative perspective. The film can be visually stunning at times and with an intriguing additional dimension. It is well worth watching.Ian Hunter.Author of `e-Love'."
2,Not In Widescreen!,This is not a review of the contents of this DVD. This is a complaint that it is listed as widescreen when it isn't. I can't believe that a brand new movie is released on disc without the widescreen format. Very misleading and disappointing.
3,meh,"Mercedes Amberson, a student at the Cooper Riding Academy for Girls in Cooper Hollow, New York, is one of the richest girls at the school. She's also very lonely, a product of her parents ""unemotional availability"", according to her therapist. One night while at The Night Owl Club, she meets the lead singer of a new band playing there and they hit it off; but there's something wrong with Conner Egan. He's older then he looks, around 200 years older, and he's looking for someone to take his place as a vampire. The woman he loved 200 years ago did the same to him to free herself and live out her mortal life, and being trapped as a vampire has not made him happy.It's an okay book, I read it in a day, Cameron's writing is lacking, and I've noticed that tends to happen in several of her books."
4,miny men,"upon recieving this product I was very disappointed because of how small they are (exctly 1 inch tall) but after arranging them on my 6yr olds model city - I noticed how much fun he was having with them. He said the size is good for his small city. so what can I say, if he like it - I love it."
5,A picture is worth a 1000 words,"This book is an absolute must for the aspiring classical guitarist. The pictures of Segovia's hand positions are the best for learning , period. I have this book open at all times when practicing so i can watch his hands vs. watching my hands in a mirror. The Segovia Technique is in my opinion the only way to make classical guitar tones that please every and all ears. I also recommend The Art of Classical Guitar Playing. By Charles Duncan."
4,A good book for a classical guitarist's library.,This book was reasonably priced and in good condition. The price for a new copy was absolutely prohibitive. This is the kind of book that is good for a starting guitarist. My thought process is that if I can pick up two or good ideas/techniques that will improve my playing it is well worth the cost and effort to read it.
5,my favourite Theresian book,Las moradas is a summary of Saint Therese path towards spiritual growth and development.A most for all spiritual seakers and a landmark of mystic literature. Congratulations for making itavailable in Kindle Thank you
1,Pesima ortografia,"Este clasico de Santa Teresa de Avila, en especial este libro tiene una pesima ortografia que el libro no se puede leer, no se entiende porque es excesivo como las palabras estan mal escritas y tienes que adivinar que palabra es la correcta. Fue una mala experiencia tratar de leerlo, asi que tuve que volver a comprar pero otra publicacion y en otra tienda, y donde vienen todas sus obras completas en un solo libro."
5,classic album,"My favorite songs on The Gap Band III album are Yearning For Your Love, Burn Rubber On Me, Are You Living, Sweet Caroline, Humpin, The Way, Gash Gash Gash. Very good album. Humpin song is the jam."
4,The Gap on a roll,"The Gap Band started rolling on this Album.after this Album The Greatness of this Group really took off.""Humpin"" was the Jam here.but a Ballad took center Stage ""Yearnin for your Love"" took them to a whole different level.strong Funk Grooves&The Smooth Flow&Vibe of Charlie Wilson."
4,Their Breakthrough album,This album helped put the gap band on the map. The dance classic Burn Rubber is on here as well as the ballad Yearnin' for your love. The record that did not get its due is humpin'. A nice addition to your collection.
5,THE GAP BAND 3,THIS ALBUM WAS THE STUFF THE GAP BAND WAS IN HIGH GEAR IN BEGINNING OF THE 80S THEY PICK UP WHERE PARLIAMENT LEFT OFF THE BALLADS WERE HOT BUT ''HUMPIN'' WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GAP BAND IT IS BADDDEEESSSTTT SONG I HAD EVER HEARD I HEARD A GUY BLASTING IT IN MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD IN EARLY 80s I WAS 8 or 9 BUT I WAS HOOKED SO FUNKY IT SOUNDED LIKE STEVIE WONDER DOING A RAP IT MAKES ME HOT AND THINK ABOUT EVERY WHITE WOMAN I WANT TO ROMANCE BURN RUBBER ON ME WAS THE JAM TOO WHEN I NOTICE THAT CHARLIE SUNG LIKE STEVIE WONDER I SAID TO MYSELF THE GAP BAND CANT GO WRONG I WOULD NOT TRADE THIS FOR A MILLION DOLLARS THE GAP BAND AND STEVIE WONDER MY TOP FAVORITES
2,a bad electronic edition,"I'm sorry I spent a dollar on it. There are punctuation errors and this doesn't keep the stanza form. Instead of four line stanzas with the middle two indented, an entire canto is smashed together. Flat out typos are rare, but the punctuation is not loyal as random question marks appear.no good for anyone taking the poem seriously."
3,VERY SMALL FOR A BIG PRICE,It's very very cute! Although compared to my other yearly Pug ornaments this is the smallest and most expensive. Is it the economy or a cheap company? If it were any smaller I'd need a magnifying glass to see it on my tree. My Pug is an angel so I had to get it though. Next years ornament I will make sure is the biggest yet!
4,American classic in its own time,"One has to be full of admiration for the efforts of Ms. Upshaw to use her talent to promote ""modern"" classical music. Sometimes it works fantastically as the Barber piece in this recording, sometimes the results are uneven, no fault of Ms Uspshaw, as in Mirabai songs here too. Barber's Knoxville: summer of 1915 is a very intriguing piece. Prose set to music. It works very well but one wonders how did that ever happen. Here Ms. Uspshaw makes us stop wondering and just relax and enjoy it. The mark of great artistry. And the intelligence of Mr. Zinman in understanding the modern musical language has to be commended. A great team. Too bad that one has to take off a star since the choices of works for this CD is not the best and somewhat detract from each other. Yet, just for the Barber and Stravinsy pieces, this is a must have CD."
3,"Nice quality and price, but know what ""satin nickel"" means for Moen","These are well made and are pretty, but the ""satin nickel"" finish does not match the satin nickel finish of my faucets, knobs or the towel shelf. This finish looks milky grey, almost like it has metallic paint. Other satin nickel products I have seen have had a different finish than these, so if you are a stickler for all the metal in a room matching, make sure they are all Moen products."
2,An improvement.,"Though better than the first two installments, especially in terms of meshing with the Amber cosmology. It is still generally lacking. The whole story seems generally rushed and fails to really explore anything to any depth. The protagonist remains uninteresting, alternating between ineptitude and over-competence for no clear or identifiable reason."
2,Johnny Hartman lacks heart. Disappointed.,"This review is not for the sound quality of this Hybrid/Sacd which is four stars. Problem is, Johnny Hartman does nothing for me. I know he's loved by many but to me his voice is generic, like someone who might make it into the finals of American Idol. And that ain't a good thing. Buy if you have to collect everything related to John Coltrane or if you just completely disagree with my assessment of Hartman's voice. Don't buy if you're expecting a lot of Coltrane genius. He's only a prop on this one. Sorry."
3,Really Liked it At First...,"The first time I played this CD, I really liked it. Until it reached the end, and there's an awkward pause. That isn't the artist's fault, I know. Over time, though, I've discovered I'll take this out of the track selections, and am not reaching for it as often.Now the beauty of life and people is variety in tatstes. I'm sure there are those who'll love it, so I recommend you listen (if you can) to the sample tracks. He really is amazing on the guitar. Just... lacks something for me. Soulfullness? A sexy edge? Not sure."
5,Compilation of the most successful female artist of the 80's,"""The Immaculate Collection"" proves that Madonna is one the greatest and most influencial female artist of all time. This is a compilation of her greatest hits from 1983-1990 plus two new tracks: ""Justify My Love"" and ""Rescue Me"". This album shows how she's evolved as an artist. It guides us to funky underground to funky sexy to bubble gum pop with a message to religious to erotica. Every track proves that she knows how to attract an audience and keep them guessing what will happen next.""The Immaculate Collection"" is an important album for all Madonna fans. All who enjoy her music should also buy ""GHV2""(Greatest Hits Vol. 2), the compilation that continues where this ends."
5,Madonna IS the Queen of Pop,"If anybody dares to say that Madonna is not the queen of pop, please, play this album for that person. If he/she does'nt fall in love with Madonna after it, don't even try, it's a basket case. Altough many people does'nt like Madonna that much, they must also admit that such classic pop hits as ""Like a Virgin"", ""Holiday"", ""Like a Prayer"", ""Vogue"", ""Crazy for You"" etc. will remain in the history of music as important pieces of pop music. This album is the very best greatest hits collection there is or probably ever be. It's just the perfect way to start listening Madonna if you are a first timer. It has all the basic Madonna songs everybody knows' even your grandmother. But it's not for anybody very tight or conservative. ""Justify My Love"" is'nt the song that you should play at a southern babtist party. But the simple truth is, Madonna rules!!!!"
4,"Love her or hate her, Madonna is part of the 80's","80's pop would have not been the same without the material girl, and here you have her greatest hits all in one. No 80's inspired party is complete with out her, so if you want a walk in memory lane, this is one for you."
5,IMMACULATE ARTIST!!,"This is simply the best greatest hits collection i own. It's great. i bought it when i was 13(5 years ago) and i still play it daily. Though i didnt experience the 80's, were madonna was at the top. This collection really convinced me that shes the ultimate and only Queen of Pop.The tracks are amazing!! All of them are. I mean if you like pop music. THIS IS FOR YOU! otherwise dont bother. i'm not completely satisfied with it though. To be named the immaculate collection it needed more hits like Burning up, dress you up, Causing a commotion to be added. Anyways its great"
5,Greatest Hits From The Greatest Female Artist,"One could say that 1990 was Madonna's year. She starred in the box office hit Dick Tracy. The movie was accompanied by a hit album featuring her smash hit Vogue. Her Blonde Ambition Tour was getting praise all over the world. In the winter of 1990, she would release what many consider one of the most important greatest hits albums ever. The Immaculate Collection covers Madonna's biggest songs of the 80s and a few new ones. Justify My Love is a spectacular song and hints at what was to come. Rescue me is the other new song but it's just as good. Selling 10 million copies, this is one of Madonna's bestselling albums and it shows us the magic she made back then; the magic she still makes now."
2,"Very good songs, Terrible Collection","This CD totally ruined some good songs. Although I am not a fan of Madonna, I have liked her some songs like ""Crazy for you"", ""Live to tell"". That is why I bought this cd. But oh, gosh. The sound quality is horrible. Listen to the original sound track of ""Vision quest""(I mean ""Crazy for you""). Then try the song in this cd. If you are not dumb, you will know how bad the sound quality of this. Why they did that? They want me to buy her previous albums again? Crazy-for-Money persons."
1,Overrated,"What is all the fuss about madonna? She can dance about as well as the average woman, sing maybe a little better, but only since she had voice training for Evita, and as for acting, we'd better not go there. I'm sick of seeing her so much on TV, and this album is an unwelcome return from manufactured songs that have clogged the airwaves for decades.Feeble."
2,?,"madonna fans will relive their fantasies with this collection of tired songs we still hear. madonna girl give it up, how many sexual statements can you make."
1,Hand in hand with MTV....,"Madonna symbolizes like nobody eles the damage that MTV began to inflinge over pop music in the middle eighties, when MTV started to collect money from the record companies in order to display its lousy videos."
1,Madonna sucks!,"THIS no talent is supposed to be the best pop singer of the 80s? Her whiney, nasal voice sounds like she needs a shot of Afrin nasal spray. Laura Branigan was way better than Madonna."
5,An Immaculate Collection of music from an Immaculate Woman,"Madonna has to be one of the most influental and well known artists of the 20th century. Her music is loved by all ages, all races and all kinds of people from all around the world. There is not one person on this earth who can admit to not liking a Madonna song.This greatest hits collection ""The Immaculate Collection"" gives her fans and the general public an insight into her amazing musical career from the years 1983 up until 1990. While a few of her best tracks are missing from this collection ""Who's That Girl"", ""Angel"" and ""Oh Father"", the 15 greatest hits and the 2 new songs on this album will provide any music loving person with just over 75 minutes of listening bliss. Enjoy this trip, Immacaulate Colletion II coming soon (i hope!)....."
3,Not so Immaculate!,"The only way this would be an Immaculate collection is to include every single she released worldwide, in their original form from Everybody to Rescue Me as a double greatest hits album.All but the last 2 songs have been distorted by q sound. The tracklisting should have been 1. Everybody 2. Burning Up 3. Lucky Star 4. Holiday 5. Borderline 6. Like A Virgin 7. Material Girl 8. Crazy For You 9. Into The Groove 10. Angel 11. Gambler 12. Dress You Up 13. Love Don't Live Here Anymore 14. Live To Tell 15. Papa Don't Preach 16. True Blue 17. Open Your Heart 18. La Isla Bonita 19 Who's That Girl 20. Causing A Commotion 21. The Look Of Love 22. Spotlight (fade) 23. Like A Prayer 24. Express Yourself 25. Cherish 26. Dear Jessie 27. Oh Father 28. Keep It Together 29. Vogue 30. Hanky Panky 31. Justify My Love 32. Rescue Me"
5,Great!,BUY THIS CD!THIS IS SUCH A GREAT COLLECTION ALL MADONNA HITS ARE HERE.THEN YOU HAVE TO CHECK OUT GHV2.DON'T WAIT ORDER NOW!
1,Remixes Throughout,"If you're thinking that this might be a good collection of Madonna's hits up to 1990, you're only half right. Sure, most of the songs are hits, but if you plan on hearing the ORIGINAL versions of these songs, you're out of luck. Almost everything here is remixed, rerecorded, or just totally unlike the versions made famous through radio airplay and on MTV. If you have all the early Madonna albums and singles, then this CD might hold some interest as a sort of dance club mix, but if you're like most of us who want only the big hits in their original versions, pass this one up."
5,fun dancing or singing music,"wow I never liked madonna until i heard the c.d immaculate collection! It just blew me away in the blink of an eye1 I am especially fond of the songs: Holiday,shining star, and like a virgin! They are the 3 most commonly found songs that i would be humming on a regular basis! awesome beat and lyrics too!"
5,A perfect choice,"I am not a big fan of pop music, this said, I can still give credit to those who make pop music at a higher level. Madonna is, without a doubt, one of the best artist of pop music of the 80's, the choice of tracks is perfect and this cd is a must have if you want the best pop music, so many hits, almost incredible. Ciao !"
2,Disappointing,"Madonna had some great hits and a lot of them are on this album - but where are the original versions? If you had an ear permanently affixed to the radio in the 80's like I did, you will definitely feel dudded by the paltry offerings from her early 80's period. I am particularly alarmed by what suspiciously sounds like her voice being sped up. This is very noticeable on ""Like A Virgin"" and ""Lucky Star"". She sounds like a 5-year old for goodness sake! If you want the real versions it looks like you might just have to go out and buy the individual albums."
1,This is everything that is wrong with pop music.,"Throw this pap onto your CD player and just get sickened by the garbage that comes from your speakers. She is no musician and has absolutely no musical talent. It is a shame that she has lasted this long. A new haircut and her ""fans"" gush about her chameleon-like persona. Yikes! Anything to distract you from the fact that she [is weak]. Listen to this CD and you can just hear her limited range and even [weaker]lyrics."
1,The role model,"The role model for every talentless attention seeking waste of space in the whole inglorious world of pop. You have to admire her for making a fortune out of making monkeys of her poor duped fanbase. Her writing is worse than her acting , which is even worse than her singing. Her whole career a sustained exercise in sleight of hand."
3,The Not-So-Immaculate Collection,"Hmph! This is Madonna, the Queen of Controversy, in her greatest hits. Yeah they're great prior to her downfall, but Madonna fans who think she's the best female artist out there better THINK AGAIN cause she can't sing. And she's taken the name of the Virgin Mary in vain! Now I know why ""Like A Virgin,"" ""Papa Don't Preach"" and others have become controversial."
2,Lackluster,"Uh, Dont quite know what to say about this release, besides the fact that it is Lackluster and not Great..Its just, well-okay..Madonna was big in the 80's, that decade that we all look back on and cringe..well, i believe she is one of those reasons..I think she became talented in the 90's w/ Ray of Light and w/ the Secret Album...that is GOOD Pop Music...Her and Mariah are vying for the Crwon of the Most Successful and Still Relevant Diva Title, But My Money is On Mariah b/c in 100 years I think people will soon realize Madonna was never really pushing any buttons, she was just a clever girl who was always interested in making as much money as she could--she knows how to manipulate the shhep-le...But Mariah's Voice will stand the test of time..no matter how she dresses...Buy Mariahs four disc Greatest Hits/Remix Albums..or even her #1's c.d...That is FANTASTIC Pop..."
4,The Immaculate Collection,"The Immaculate Collection is greatest hits between the years 1983 and 1990. Here we get tracks such as Lucky Star, Material Girl, Live to tell, Express yourself and Justify my love to mention a few of the many gems included on this amazing collection. Gene Sculati has written the linernotes and writes a very interesting take on Madonnas every release that is included on this release. The booklet is filled with pictures of Madonna and not all of them look that great. 4/5."
5,Madonna's Greatest!,"This is a great collection of all of my favorite Madonna songs. I miss the Madonna of the 80's, so this was my ideal choice of Greatest Hits. Love it!"
5,Great Dance Music,"I have always been a ""middle of the road"" Madonna fan, but this CD has alot of the great hits that I used to dance to in the discos! Still makes me want to get up and dance!"
4,A Great Way To Start A Collection,"If you're just getting into Madonna, this is a great album to familiarize yourself with her work. If you're already into Madonna, the album might be worth buying just for ""Rescue Me"" and the better versions of ""Vogue"" and ""Express Yourself"". However, a lot of these songs have been cut down and many of them lost something in the translation. The version of ""Like A Prayer"" on this one doesn't come close to the original, and this is true of several of the songs here. It's still an enjoyable listen but I prefer listening to her songs in their entirety."
5,Must have for any CD collection,"Madonna's *Immaculate Collection* is one of those must-haves. This belongs in everyone's collection; it's the type of CD you can play from beginning to end, without skipping tracks. Every song is a gem; it includes her dance and pop hits, as well as ballads. And another great thing about it - you'll know all the songs, and can sing along. Pick this up."
5,Absolutely Awesome and a must have album for Madonna fans and casual fans,"This is a five star album and the only Madonna album or collection of hits you need. The album is all that and a bag of chips. In fact the 17 hits on this album show why Madonna is the queen of pop music and why she has been such a big star since the 80's. I do not think Madonna can top or produce better dance/pop music than she did in the 80's and early 90's, so she will always be remembered for these hits in my opinion. This album never gets old and stands its time. The music on this album is completely ageless and feel good music."
4,The best of her 80's material.,"Looking at the tracklist here, what else could she call this album? It's 15 of her biggest hits from the 80's. Included is everything from ""Holiday"" and ""Like A Virgin"", to ""Express Yourself"" and ""Vogue"". Plus two extra tracks, one being the excellent ""Justify My Love"", which alone makes this collection worth having. Any level of ""Madonna"" fan should own this. It's even more essential than ""GHV2"". If you want one of her best albums, go for ""Like A Prayer"" or ""Ray Of Light"". In fact, ""Cherish"" them all."
5,Great collection of her hits,"Lately I've been into Madonna, which is why I asked for this cd for Christmas. I wasn't disappointed. It's a great collection of her greatest hits since she burst onto the pop scene.Something I've definitely noticed is the way her singing voice develops and changes from the beginning of her career. In the beginning it was more nasally and high, particularly ""Like a Virgin"". It's almost like you're listening to her develop her voice on the cd itself. She's definitely gotten better over time.If you're a Madonna fan, definitely a great cd to own!"
5,"One Against Nature, Bka, the Virgin Collection....","...Or the Sanctified Years. Dig it. It's got evvything from those controversial years. In evvybody's fuss, no one but those of us head bobbin' and dancin' to her songs noticed that there is a lotta nice music in La Ciccione's repertoire..'well, just who'da thunk it'? Maybe, just maybe, that's what she's been sayin'..? That the music will stand without the videos. And in spite of what one thinks of Madonna the dance icon. Years from now they're gonna be jammin' on ""Lucky Star"". Hmmm...Crank up ""Express Yourself"", baby, and let's jam!"
3,An immaculate deception,"If you thought you were getting a collection of Madonna's greatest hits, well, think again. Works on this album are trimmed to make room for other deservedly unknown tracks that Louise hoped would become hits. Once again, we have been had: if you want the songs in thier original form, you must buy each album seperatly. Experience has made her rich..."
2,For kids only,"If you like a trip to the eighties, then this is the album for you. That's all I can say about this album. Her earlier tracks sound much better than her recent output, almost sound monotonic."
2,Horrible Crap cd,"I so regret buying this cd, it is not a complete anthology of Madonna's hits and it was released too soon to make it a thorough collection. For one thing, most of the songs are EDITED for time. The best part of ""Holiday"" is gone, the best part of ""Into The Groove"" is gone, the best part of ""Lucky Star"" is gone, ""Angel"" isn't included, ""Dress U Up"" isn't included, ""Everybody"" isn't included, ""Burning Up"" isn't included. The cd doesn't even use some of the better 80's dance versions of the hits. I'm actually sincerely angered by this cd, with all the money Madonna has, to do this to her fans so you have to buy ALL of the cds for the total collection. THANKS MADONNA GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!"
2,it is better to download these hits on the net,"ya i dont understand the reviews on here. say why YOU think its good rather than giving people stats on how many #1 hits Madonna has had or how many albums she's sold. truth be told, most people have heard all these songs so you dont really need to read reviews. fact: Madonna had some decent pop hits in the 80s. they're on this cd, tracks 1-9 are worth listening to. post 80s Madonna is no good. your best bet is to do like me and DL the hits off a site like Kazza and Ares and don't give your money to this grubbin ho."
4,Complete Hits Package,"All hits here. Whoopee! If you are Madonna fan (you need to be slapped in face with dead fish for starter) you will like this slop. It is mixture of early screeching to the latter caterwauling that sure to leave you wanting less. The disc itself is great for coaster, so that good."
2,For 80s kids only,"If you like a trip to the eighties, then this is the album for you. That's all I can say about this album. Her earlier tracks sound much better than her recent output, almost sound monotonic."
1,CD skipped,I was so excited to get this CD and when I did all the songs on it were skipping! I was very dissapointed to say the least.
3,Immaculate? Not Quite...,"Obviously after ten years it's time for another Madonna hits collection. But ""The Immaculate Collection"" is still a worthwhile primer for the casual Madonna or 80's pop fan. ""Holiday"", ""Like a Virgin"", ""Vogue"" and ""Crazy for You"" are now rightfully considered classics. However, there are some songs missing (""Who's That Girl"", and ""Angel"" chief among them) as well as some curious edits (what the hell happened to the middle of ""Into the Groove""?). This album is worthwhile for the casual Madonna fan, or as a collection-starter. Someone who is more of a Madonna fan, though, would be better served by getting the full, original versions of some of these songs on the original albums."
5,"Good, fun pop music at its best...","Every track on ""The Immaculate Collection"" was, and still is, very fun and catchy, exactly what a pop record should be. Madonna may have had controversial lyrics or a controversial image, but her music is the core of what she has become. This collection contains her best work in the span of 8 years, and it would be at home in any pop music lover's cd stash. The tracks that highlight this album for me are, ""Borderline,"" ""Crazy For You,"" ""Cherish,"" and ""Like A Virgin."" These songs still sound fun and fresh today, and most likely would appear to be that way for the next several years.."
4,madonna at her best,"Wonderful compilation of madonna's best songs from the 80's. There are some notable exclusions however. Where is ""angel"", ""dress you up"", ""burning up""? Rather have the album versions of ""lucky star"" and ""holiday"". Overall, for 80's Madonna fans this is the album to own. In my opinion, this is her last great work. Her 90's material was less fun and she sold out to the new generation which would be fine except that her true talent was captured in the 80's. In addition to the ""Immaculate Collection"", 80's Madonna fans should also own her debut album and ""Like a Virgin"". These albums really caputure her 80's talent with material that is not on the greatest hits."
5,The best combination of Madonna songs,"This is by far the best Madonna Album ever released. It has all of her greatest hits from the first half of her career, and I don't think she left any big hits out. The second greatest hits collection that came out in 2001 failed to do what Immaculate Collection did. Greatest Hits Volume 2 didn't do well because it didn't have all the biggest hits from Madonna's second part of her career. There were many left out and some that weren't included. Immaculate Collection came out over a decade ago, and still sells big because people want a Madonna album full of all her first big hits. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves nothing less. If anything it deserves 6 stars."
4,Hits and Remixes From the Material Girl,"Madonna's ""Immaculate Collection"" contains most of the essential hits from the Material Girl's early career. Eliminate the hype and you have durable pop classics such as ""Holiday,"" ""Justify My Love"" and ""Vogue."" Purists may argue, but the extended remixes of ""Into the Groove,"" ""Express Yourself"" and ""Like a Prayer"" are superior to the original singles. Until a lavish box set comes along, this 1990 compilation remains the finest showcase for Madonna as Recording Artist."
5,The Best Madonna CD Ever!,"This is probably the definitive CD of Madonna's music - highlighting her incredible career in the 1980s. These songs are what Madonna is recognized for and her name will forever be associated with such lines as ""Material Girl,"" ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Open Your Heart."" One downside to the CD is that the songs ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Express Yourself"" are re-mixes. I bought her actual album ""Like a Prayer"" because the title song is better on that one. One song is missing from this album, however - ""Oh Father"" from the ""Like a Prayer"" album. This is one of her most emotional and dramatic songs, where is it? Anyway, this is a great album and a must have for any Madonna/80s music fan!"
4,Great but could have been even better...,"This was a nice compilation of some of Madonna's greatest hits, and a good buy. But I was disappointed that ""True Blue"" and ""Dress You Up"" were not included. I would've rather had those songs on the album than ""Justify My Love"" and ""Rescue Me""...but other than that, a good compilation."
5,The best singalong car tunes,I have always liked all of Madonnas songs since they are all singable. To have all of her best songs on one CD is great. This CD will keep you singing in your car...but don't get caught belting out the tunes when a car drives next to you!!
2,Don't Be Fooled -- It's All Remixes,"This is an okay CD, but it has some major flaws. ALL of the songs on here are NOT the original LP edits or radio versions. For example, the remixed ""Borderline"" is so distorted that you can barely hear the original keyboard arrangements! Also, ""Like A Prayer"" is a completely different version. Instead of releasing the promo versions of the Madonna songs we recognize on the radio, they released this. Also, there are an inexcuseable number of Madonna's other hits that were scrapped. ""The Immaculate Collection"" is not satisfactory for die-hard fans."
4,Pure classic Madonna--not quite how I remembered her,"I grew up listening to Madonna blaring from my older sister's room. I remember even early Madonna as being great music to dance to, but after relistening, I have to say, not so much. It's still fun, but at times repetitive, and most of the songs don't hold up as well as I would have expected."
5,This is why Madonna is one of the best...,"Listening to this album, you'll understand why Madonna is so famous. Not only is she a talented show woman who remakes herself over and over again, the music is great. Every song on this album is a gem. Whether its sexy (La Isla Bonita, Justify my Love, Like a Virgin), fun to dance to (Into the Groove, Holiday, Material Girl, Express Yourself), an emotional ballad (Live to Tell, Crazy for You) or a just great (Vogue, Papa Don't Preach, Lucky Star, etc.) its perfect. Every song on this collection is amazing and I guarantee that you'll love it. This is what got me into Madonna in the first place. Get all of her music!"
3,A Review for The Immaculate Collection.,What I find amusing is that many people proclaim this to be a greatest hits collection. If it is then its bad. If it is not then what is it. Well its a collection of Madonna songs that were popular in the 80's remastered in Q- sound or whatever. Some of the tracks are remixes. The problem is that if you look at this as a greatest hits recording then its so disapointing.Such tracks as Who's That Girl and more are missing not to mention that the first few tracks are edited and are not in their full versions. Like A Prayer is horrible remixed and this version as among the worst versions of the songs. Express Yourself is also diffrent from its original. The version of Vouge is longer and a bit boring. The two new songs are good.Overall this is a good album if you don't look at it as a greatest hits collection but if you do stay away.
4,All around good...,"Hello...This cd is all around good... But I agree that it could have beenbetter as a double cd with more of her #1 hits to date at the time of this disc's release i.e. ""Dress You Up"", ""Angel"", ""Who's That Girl"", & ""Causing a Commotion""... Don't get me wrong, this cd is definitely worth the buy... Now what I'm waiting for, is double cd dancefloor remix of her best dancefloor songs to date -Madonna Remixed"""
3,xmas gift,i got this gift for my wife for christmas she enjoys listening to it. i couldn't be more happier with my purchase.
3,Immaculate Collection is slightly disappointing,"In my childhood, I have listened to Madonna's music, especially her original songs. Except for Justify my Love and Rescue Me, all of the other songs on this cd have been slightly altered."
2,very average,the songs are catchy.and owe more to the Production than her NON-SInging self.she sounds Horrible.the songs are good though.She is one of the Most Overrated SIngers ever.the Mixes on this disc don't help her voice.if i could i'd give her a 1 1/2.she is just a Brillant Market Maker.
3,Missing Songs.,"This album is missing a lot of songs and some songs that were top ten songs. The songs missing are ""Burning Up"", ""Everybody"", ""Dress You Up"", ""Angel"", ""Who's That Girl?"", ""Causing A Commotion"" and probably many other songs that I forgot right now. i think this is a very incomplete album. I thought GHV2 would release those songs but it didn't either. Will they ever release these songs on a greatest hits CD?"
1,slow moving with no real detection,"I was very disappointed. As a big fan of historical mysteries, I expected more. More detecting at the least. Isaac doesn't do much of anything; just sort of wanders around asking vague questions. Even worse, the story wanders too. No more in the series for me!"
1,Terrible disappointment. Denigrating to Judaism,"She has created a medieval Jewish hero who doesn't pray,desecrates the Sabbath, reads Greek philosophers in preference toJewish texts, has no Jewish friends or community, a shrewish wife who's faulted for being against her daughter marrying a Christian and so on."
1,"rotten mystery: no detecting, a killer with no motive,","I'm really mystified why Caroline Roe chose to write a mystery. She can write nice prose that reads easily, and pleasant characters. But her hero does not detecting, there are no clues, the murderer is revealed completely deus ex machina and is not someone who has appeared in the book until the moment he's revealed -- she breaks the fundamental rules of the genre. Nor do I see why she chose a Jewish character. She obviously has no interest in Jewish anything -- one of the key turns in the plot involves a Jewish girl eating in a monastery. Hasn't Roe ever heard of keeping kosher? And what she does have -- a locked ghetto in medieval Spain -- is inaccurate. The first locked ghetto was Venice in the 1500s. This wasn't fair to the mystery fan, or the historical mystery fan."
5,Buy 2 copies...,"This book is structured, written, photographed and edited with parallel purpose and effect: communication of the author's respect and regard for the book's subject and for its readers. Mr. Darke sets out to inform and does so with enconomy but in full course; when he instructs, he teaches the novice and gives pause to the critic; when he photographs he shows his passion and inspires with the nature and wonder of his subjects. The book is encyclopedic, yet its prose is always to the point with the agreeable dryness of a good, well-bodied wine. Credible, trustworthy, enlightening. This is the best gardening book I have ever read. Negatives? Only one: Mr. Darke's standards are unimpeachable; those of the book's typographer and designer, however, are not."
4,Good Grass Reference,Good Reference. Author has a newer book with more grasses and pictures that may be more up to date.
2,Shows its age,"This book is mainly about pesticides, which in this day of Integrated Pest Management & caring for our environment, is just bad. There are much more up-to-date books on dealing with pests in the garden that won't damage/destroy the ecosystem that exists in your yard and the world.Please don't follow the advice in this book."
4,ESCELENTE,UN TEMA QUE SE SUELE DAR EN LA VIDA REAL SERA QUE ME GUSTAN LAS MUJERES DESPUES DE HABER PROBADO A UN HOMBRE?=?
1,PC Universe sucks,"I don't know what kind of propaganda this listing is supposed to be but PC Universe is not a good company to business with. They have shady business practices. They canceled my order with them because my ""credit card failed."" Upon contacted both my bank and Amazon it turns out the credit card charge never failed, and was in fact accepted and PC Universe canceled the order because they were out of stock. So they lied to me. Didn't ship product. And billed me anyway. Not the way to do business where I come from."
2,ok if you like this kind of thing,"newies come to town to sell the story to the world. but become the story because it's so sad people are being killed in war. God, tribe, power, are the reasons for war. we don't like your god so we kill you. we don't like your family (tribe) so we kill you. but we want the power to rule over a area, state, country, so we kill you and take that power. so the nice people ""save"" the poor underdogs by moving them into areas where killing is not on a large scale. in the end send money to help stop war & feed the hungry, stop man made global warming, cure the ill, make life nice in the world."
1,It's like CNN..only on celluloid,"This film is terrible... Not only is the narrative extremely inconsistent, it has absolutely nothing to offer visually. As far as politics goes it is about as accurate a take on the Bosnian conflict as any biased Western souce. The film could have been a little more weighted in its presentation of a conflict we Westerners have yet to understand..and with the help of movies like these, probably never will."
3,Intense look at a city under siege & the citizens' suffering,"Having read the book by Michael Nicholson first, I looked forward to seeing how it would translate to film. As with many other efforts, this one comes up short. Stephen Dillane does well as Nicholson. However, Woody Harrelson's character does not really appear in the book except as a compilation of mis-steps by various Western reporters. Marisa Tomei is a wonderful actress; however her character is not a major one in the book. The movie would have been better if she had played the role of the orphanage director, Vera Zoric'. What I did like about this movie is that it was filmed on location. The location footage brings to the forefront man's inhumanity to man. The scenes that show the destruction to Sarajevo are worth the price of purchase alone. Overall this is an above avarage movie but I would recommend the viewer read Nicholson's book first."
5,"A must see film, real beyond belief",filmed in sarajevo two days after the sieze fire this films portrays the life and times of muslims and reporters living in the town during the civil war. It shows the true horror of the bread line Massacre as well as the heart warming story of the reporter who took to england a young girl living in the city.Compelling from start to finish but not the type of cheary christmas film you may wish to give this christmas.
5,gripping,"The realism of the Bosian war is wonderfully and honestly captured in this film. Hard to watch at some times but gives the viewer a better perspective of what the people endured during this time. A wake up call... out of sight, out of mind and so ignore. Not a big fan of Woody Harrelson but now have greater respect for his acting.....as always Stephen Dillane is superb."
5,shocking and unforgettable,"admittedly i rented this out because of Goran Visnjic being in it..but that wasnt the main reason.As the opening scene unfolded i could see that this wasnt a film for the faint hearted, that on the way to a wedding the mother of the bride is shot dead.With the film progressing and the character of Risto(Visnjic)becoming more important I felt myself being drawn into what was happening, and could not help but be moved by the scenes of the orphanage.To see how these children had been mixed up in a war that led them to losing their parents had me in tears.Whilst not an entertaining film, I thought that it was well worth watching as it gave an insight(no matter how small)into what people had to go through.The acting was great and only enhanced what was a brilliant film..but one that left me shocked and upset."
5,My Favorite and Most Used Book,"This is a constantly used resource. I used a copy of the 1949 edition as a text for an undergraduate ecology course and haven't parted with it since. No doubt this book would be dust by now if the 1975 edition hadn't come along. If I had but one field guide, this would be it. The range and presentation of the material is useful to the professional and accessible to the novice. I'm amazed it's out of print. Ecologists everywhere should be outraged."
4,Useful reference,"I used the second edition of Palmer's as an undergraduate in the mid-60s. Although not as useful as a true field guide which enables to user to identify flora through leaf, bark, and seed classification it is still a useful handbook once the reader identifies a family of plants. I enjoyed reading the descriptions and paging through sections of text to find information about various specimens. My copy, although used, was in very good condition making it well worth the price."
2,Many pictures-little information,"I was somewhat disappointed after receiving this book. Although there are a huge amount of pictures of various Christmas lighting sets, the organization was poor and there was precious little information about the history of electric Christmas lighting. According to the bios of the authors, they reportedly amassed a great deal of knowledge in their field of collecting, but precious little of that knowledge has been shared with the reader."
5,A must have book for the serious collector,"This book represents a major effort in the field of Christmas lighting collecting and research. Great pictures, perhaps a bit haphazard in the way they are laid out (no chronological order) but this will be many people's only way to see some very rare and unique items. A wonderful coffee table book!"
2,Nostalgic Disney fun -- Disappointing DVD,"It's a shame that Disney refuses to exert that little bit of extra effort (and possibly expense - ""there's the rub"") to restore its films and release them in their original theatrical ratios (aka: widescreen). These films appeal mainly to ""grown-up"" Disney fans, scholars, and collectors. For a modest comedy like this, the ratios aren't too distracting; for major productions - like Babes in Toyland, The Moon-Spinners, and Blackbeard's Ghost -- the pan-and-scan is horrible. It would be better for Disney to slow down its release schedule and take the extra time to prepare first class DVD's. The Disney name used to stand for quality and technical innovation; appparantly, those standards no longer apply."
3,Merlin Jones,The movie is about the zainy antics of the campus egg head Merlin Jones. Merlin takes an old football helmet and uses a series of electrical ciruits to increase his memory. The fun really begins when on of the football players uses Merlin's Memory Helmet in his college studies. This is a can't miss early Walt Disney Film!
3,"You may FEEL THE FIRE, but it doesn't ignite","Reba's career has spanned more than two decades, and as you listem to her albums, one can hear the changing times, and the changing woman. Not quite a diva, Reba shows a lot of growth and potential in one of her best EARLY works. This album features her 1st Top Ten single, ""You Lift Me Up To Heaven,"" as well as some stellar songwriting. The stand-out tracks are ""If I Had It My Way"" and ""My Turn"" If you like Reba, you'll like this album, if you're looking for hits...look elsewhere."
5,NOW THIS IS A CLASSIC ALBUM!!,When you find a Reba album where all the songs are first class material and she does an outstanding job on every one of them...you'd better hold on to it tight because this is rarely the case any more. This is one of her very best!! Every song is Class A stuff and Reba is simply grand!!! Bravo!!
4,Even In The Early Years You Can Hear The Quality,"As always, Reba comes back with more great songs. She gives them a whole new meaning and refreshing sound"
4,Fine,"Hello,By a mistake I did not see that it was a kassett and not a CD, but this is all my own mistake."
3,A worthwhile investment,"These songs on here still didn't make it to #1. This was Reba's 3rd album with Mercury, and she didn't get a #1 until her 5th album. These songs are sometimes a little more pop, and sometimes a little more balladistic. I believe this is worth buying, because although 7 of the 10 are on Oklahoma Girl, My Turn, Long Distance Lover, and Look At The One Who's Been Looking At You are all great songs not found on there. I believe you should buy it, that is if you can track it down for a good price. I found the CD for $3.99 at a used CD store. Check those places. If you see any of her Mercury albums, you should purchase them immediately, because they are very rare."
4,An American Woman in Afghanistan before the Taliban,"The author, an American already seasoned to living abroad, recounts her adventures during two years in Afghanistan in the 1970's. Women could work in the offices and schools then, before the religious fundamentalists came to powerEven though it was a safer time for foreigners (her husband was an agriculturalist with the UN.) Ms. Stratton seems to have taken some unusually adventuresome risks in her travels about the country. She nonchalantly explains that most Afghans were not dangerous, merely curious.Afghanistan may be different now, but Ms. Stratton's story shows us a more peaceful time and perhaps gives hope for the future. I found her book very readable and informative."
2,Below expectations,"very thin book. Only a small bit about ""my body"". Was not what we were looking for."
1,"Poor design, unreliable, frustrating to use","I've never reviewed a product on the web before, but recognize the picture of the Brother Intellifax 1960c and write to try to spare others the time and frustration of having to deal with a machine so poorly conceptualized, designed and built that its problems are too numerous to catalogue. Never mind the money; don't subject yourself to having to deal with the machine."
4,Brother Intellifax-1960C,"I was very satisfied with this product. It has so far performed up to my expectations. The only problem I have had is with the paper tray. It is a little difficult to set up the first few times. Once you get the hang of it though it is fine. It prints very clearly and the phone/answering machine is also very clear. The last machine I had was a panasonic and it lasted about 5 years with only occasional use. This machine already outshines that one in performance, it was well worth the money. I think this is a great machine for a home office or small business..."
