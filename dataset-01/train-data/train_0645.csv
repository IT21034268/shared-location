3,"Good developmental info, but badly in need of an update!","I'm giving this book a mixed review. I thought the developmental information was extremely helpful - it was great to know my son was behaving like a ""typical"" 3.5-year-old rather than a sociopath in the making. However, the solutions offered by the authors are less than stellar. They basically encourage parents to dump the kid off at the babysitter's or daycare as much as possible until they straighten up. Excuse me? The last chapter, which had supposedly ""real"" questions from parents, was laughable at best and mildly horrifying at worst. I'd love to see the authors update this book, because it is really outdated."
3,Not very helpful,"I found this book to be completely lacking in much practical information. I was hoping for some insight into why my 3 year old acts the way she does, and some practical solutions for dealing with it, but I didn't find that. What I found was something like ""some three year olds are like this, and some are like that and others are like something else entirely."" That much I could have figured out on my own. Even less helpful was the section on ""equilibrium"". Three year olds are wonderful, but when they're three and a half, look out. But then again, not all three year olds hit these ""equilibrium"" points at the same time... or at all. Just not a helpful book. Don't bother."
2,"Poorly written, repetitive, no new ideas...","I would definitely not recommend this book. The author mostly states the obvious, over and over again. Also, the content is not well organized and very repetitive (oops, did I say that already?). I did not gather any new coping strategies from this book. In addition, the author recommends several times that parents should let a babysitter handle their child if the child is resisting certain rituals like eating, bathing, dressing, etc... That is not helpful advice for parents who actually want to learn to deal with their children's changing behavior. Look elsewhere for a book on three-year-olds"
2,Ridiculous and Unrealistic,"Seriously, the core advice of this book is that 3 year olds are totally testing their parents, and they don't really care about testing other people, so you should get a babysitter.That might, arguably, be helpful for families with a lot of money. But for those of us in the world of limited discretionary income, it looks more like advice that makes me want to join the 3 year old in having a tantrum and meltdown, throwing the book.The best I can say about this book is that it is somewhat reassuring to learn that it isn't just your 3 year old who acts psychotic, and yours probably isn't a very short sociopath, but a normal 3 year old.Good luck finding a sitter."
1,don't waste your money,Worthless. Completely outdated and condescending. I was hoping for some practical insight into my relationship with my three year old and instead I was advised that I should leave her with a teenage babysitter as much as possible. The 80s were a good decade for music but apparently not for parenting advice. I thought $11.00 was a value; this book wouldn't be a value at $1.00.
2,not useful if you look for more than just behavioral,"description. The book uses a lot of pages to describe different kids behaviors, I guess, from author's observation. But it defintely lacks of insights for why of those behaviors. So if you just look for what kind of behavior you would expect from your kid at that age, this might be the right book. But if you look for some information like psychological analysis on different kids hehaviors and effective ways to deal with those behaviors, look else where."
4,Good information,"Provided good, general information. Easy to read and generally interesting.Will definitely get Your 4 year old...Not too long, so managable"
4,Laughed out loud,"3 year olds tell stories. And there are days you don't want to see them. It was refreshing to find pages here -- in the still of the night -- where we could laugh out loud at our 3 year old. Yes, she tells the stories that go on and on and make sense to her. They are delicious and this series of books is such a great help as time goes along. Just ordered four year old."
5,what a relief!,"This book has been extremely helpful! I would highly recommend it to anyone with a 3 year old! Now that I understand better what is going on developmentally, I have been able to relax and become a better parent!"
1,Boring,"This was just too boring for me to really give it a chance. I needed a book with tips and solutions, not just an over-analysis of what is typical 3-year-old behavior."
4,Very Helpful,"This book is great. Confirmed a lot of my thoughts, really helped us to understand why our 3 year old acts the way she does."
2,"Agree with ""A Reader From Texas.""","Some of the developmental information is helpful, but the methods described in the book (isolating children from each other, turning your child over to a baby-sitter as a method of ""parenting"") are archaic at best, draconian at worst. Stay far away. Try any book by Dr. Sears."
4,Lotus Guide magazine,"Healing TraumaBy Peter A. Levine, PhDISBN 978-1-59179-658-9 (Sounds True, 2008)Peter A. Levine, PhD, author of Waking the Tiger, spent 35 years studying the effects of trauma on the body. In Healing Trauma, he has written a slim companion book to the first book, describing his 12-phase trauma-recovery program and providing an audio CD of his somatic experiencing exercises.This book may be useful for those who have experienced a minor trauma and who would like to try using Levine's techniques. However, for those with a more complex trauma history (multiple losses or an abuse history), I recommend this book and CD be used in conjunction with therapy, as the techniques are oversimplified in the book.Rahasya Poe, Lotus Guide Magazine and Author of ""To Believe Or Not To Believe: The Social & Neurological Consequences of Belief Systems"""
1,shouldn't be sold on kindle,"The content of this book is excellent. However, a significant part of the information relies on a CD with specific exercises. I recommend if you purchase this that you buy it as a new book NOT Kindle."
2,Good starting point but the techniques are not useful,"You start this book thinking that this is the reason why I'm suffering but the techniques he created don't seem to work at all. They look artificial and you get an instinctive feeling that they're not gonna work, and for me they really don't seem to have an effect. I'd suggest you go to a Rosen Method practioner. This method has scientific evidence of how it works and seems to cure everyone's stuck feelings who has tried it."
1,NOT FOR THE CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE!,"At least as of this date, the product description omits the following important detail: the blanket is nylon OVER A POLYURETHANE CORE. Polyurethane outgasses for a long time and is thus dangerous to the chemically sensitive."
2,Disappointed,"This blanket is not worth the money!! It doesn't wear well, doesn't wash well, isn't comfortable at all. Don't waste your money!!"
2,Not as pictured,"The blanket quality was good & I received it in a timely manner, but it was a completely different color then what was show. Instead of lilac it looked grey."
3,Revision Required,"Although this is book is academically solid and thoroughly researched (hence the stars), my students and I found some of the lessons hard to complete given the space on which to write. I loved the word lists at the front, but had to recopy and add to my students' worksheets as I went. All teachers dream of worksheets which can be reproduced ""as is"" as time and convenience are crucial in our field. A little reformatting and this would be a five star resource!"
5,Great book!! Highly recommend it. No other book like it.,"This book really prepares a young student for high level mastery of vocabulary and is a necessary tool especially regarding today's high stakes testing (i.e. STAR). The lessons are challenging, yet fun and imaginative. A must have book for students who need to understand how roots are critical to expanding one's vocabulary. Two thumbs up!"
3,A glossary would be nice,"My sixth grader is getting very frustrated with this book because the definitions of the words are not actually included. She has written ""This book stinks!"" on the title page.I checked in the back for a glossary, but there is none. Some may think this is an excellent opportunity for looking up hundreds of words in the dictionary, but I would prefer my daughter focus her time on other things, like using the words in sentences.So, I feel that this is a book that will require a lot more handholding by the adult, who will need to explain and perhaps even write out what the words mean. Thus, only three stars from us."
4,Byzance by Rochas wonderful however I found better deal at,"Byzance by Rochas is astonishingly beautiful perfume. For many years it was my absolute favourite, However I found a larger bottle at a much better price, better deal at Thefragrancefactory.com they also had my lotion and shower gels in Byzance, thats the place to go."
2,downloaded,"Be cautious about downloading because it never was able to show anything because of the buffering. I needed to show my students this video, but had to make other plans so in truth I have no idea how the video is as far as quality."
4,Tati's final feature film,"After suffering major losses with his previous film, ""Playtime,"" he returned to his successful formula of following Mr. Hulot's adventures in this his last feature release. He produced a TV movie for Swedish television after this for his last effort.If you love Tati, you'll love this film."
4,Traffic,This is the last of the Tati films and was excellent. The special features add a great deal of information and provide one the opportunity to see the real Tati.
4,"More fun from Tati - not spectacular, but solid.","Good fun, not a masterpiece like Mon Oncle or Playtime, but if you like Tati's other stuff, it's a must have."
1,Painfully dull,"Having seen ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" many times the past few years and enjoying it fully every time, we decided to order another of Jacques Tati's movies, ""Traffic."" ""Traffic"" was void of humor -- no funny lines or sight gags. The possibilities were endless, but not utilized. Mr. Hulot does his funny walk and jerky motions, but they're not tied to any comic situation. This movie left us totally disillusioned."
3,Good story but errors distract,Interesting story and characters but the errors distracted me at times. If it had been edited better I would have enjoyed it more.
4,Great for a late night read...,"What a great book to end your hectic day. I became engrossed in this world of murder and intrigue. You will too! It's like a little bit of ""big-girl"" fun. I can't wait to see what Detective Lindsay gets into next!"
5,BEST gate ever,This gate has withstood the test of time. We breed Boston Terriers and have 2 children. This gate is strong enough for my 44 lb. 5 year old to ride it open and closed without it coming out of the wall. It is lovely and works great
5,Mason2,"Excellent quality, much better than I had expected. If your a Perry Mason Fan, this is a must buy! Keep them coming...."
5,Perry Mason: 5 Season Pack,Excellent series if you are a Perry Mason fan. I have purchased the 1st 6 seasons and will purchase the last 3 or 4 seasons.
3,Picture freezes,Viewed disc 1 of season one volume 2 and everything was fine. However all 4 movies on disc 2 froze and were unwatchable. Have yet to view all the other discs so don't yet know if this is just one bad disc or if there will be more problems.
5,Perfect,I love this flashlight! It's super bright and very small so it doesn't take up a lot of room on my keychain. Best little flashlight I've bought.
5,nice and bright keychain light,"I recommend this light, it is bright and light for your keychain. I bought this for my girlfriend to put on her keychain."
5,Works great!,"I got tired of pulling out my phone to use as a flashlight to get my key in the key hole at night, so I decided to buy a little LED for my keyring. This light is perfect for what I need it for and is brighter then I expected. It's also smaller than I expected so when I shine it at the door I have to angle it down in order to get my key in. I could honestly aim it at the floor and have enough light to still be able to see so its no problem at all. Its cheap in price but not cheap in quality, you should definitely buy it!Pros:BrightSmallCon:I guess a con could be you have to hold the button down for the light to stay on, but that could also cause it to stay on in your pocket and lose battery life."
3,this is so bright,"I just bought this key chain a few days ago and I love it. My brothers took it to use for an outdoor game last night after dark and ended up having to use a regular flashlight because this is so bright. I really like the three different light modes, although I wish the strobe setting flashed faster. It also feels very nice in your hand. It's very small but heavy for its size."
3,Problems with the switch,"I have had several of these lights over the past few years. They are great when they work but it seems that eventually the switch fails. Press and nothing happens or the light flickers. This is not a battery issue.The company does have a lifetime warranty on these and they have replaced the ones I have returned to them, but I have to pay the postage and it's sort of a pain."
5,The best in class,"I have used these lights in Iraq, Africa in red and white. I love this product, it does not come on when you don't want it to like other lights and is small enough to hook to your dog tags or button hole or a key chain. I recommend highly, Retired Special Forces"
2,Annoying Flashlight,"I purchased this micolight reading a map, etc, in the dark. The light is bright but highly uneven. It has NO switch to leave the light on! Very annoying."
1,doubtful!,I doubt this is the Photon brand. This .01 to .30 offer goes back and forth under several different sellers names. Beware. It is most likely fake.
1,Kindle Edition Unreadable,Download a sample before purchasing the Kindle Edition. It is not worth the effort to try to decipher. Amazon needs to be more careful about Kindle editions.
1,Kindle format,This book was easily downloaded and yet unreadable.The format that came through read like computer code. While the words/content of the book were there - so was the formatting code.
2,love of a god ... who beats you.,"i really, really wanted to like the works of JoN. i have tried on numerous occasions to read them, but the insistence on god being the origin of all her afflictions, that somehow making her miserable, sick, and suffering was god showing her love is frankly a sickness of soul. no one in their right mind would recommend that anyone be in a relationship of any kind with anyone who treated them this way.i'm sorry, god doesn't get a 'free pass' on this one. if one's god cannot live up to god's own expectations of humanity, then this is not a god worth reading about."
2,Revelations of Divine Love,This book was recommended by a priest. I did not enjoy it. It is written in 12th century grammar. Too hard to read.
3,"Excellent Book, Less Than Stellar E-Book","This is honestly one of my favorite books. I really enjoyed the handcover Classics of Western Spirituality edition, so I was excited to see that it was available for the Kindle. However, I was disappointed to find that on almost every page there are spaces between words missing and the language is a bit archaic. It was sad to find such an inspiring, beautiful work marred by a poor presentation on the Kindle."
4,Revelations of Divine Love,"Initially I had to 'adapt' to the period language, as I have other authors of this era who have been mildly modernized by translators. Once getting into the book though I found it inspiring,awakening and most useful for Godly appreciation & meditive incitment."
2,This is Chillout music ???,This album should not be in the GU trance category. I'm a huge fan of progressive trance and this is definitely chillout or some kind of easy listening meditation music. See my listmania for some good progressive trance albums.
5,Amazing. Nick Warren is true to form on this masterpiece.,"This Cd starts out a bit slow, a bit trippy, bit druggy. But that's ok because its a just a warm up for the real bread and butter of this 30th in the series of Global Underground. Cd2 is faster, harder, stronger without sounding too cliche. If you havent heard Nick Warren live recently, you can get a good taste of his style with this mix. I recently saw him twice duting Winter Music Conference in Miami. First time at Mynt and second at Shine. Each time different styles, much like cd 1 and 2. I highly recommend this CD, excellent music by a master of his craft."
4,Not a bad read,"This book gave me more to read on Harry Potter as I wait for the release of Book 7. I found his ideas to be interesting, and much the same as my thoughts and predictions. If you like getting your hands on anything about Harry Potter then you will probably enjoy this book."
1,ahhhhh,i need the real book ! i just finished half blood prince . im gnna be so sad when i finish the series . i love harry potter . LUMOS ![:
4,"7 Unauthorized Harry Potter Book Seven News: ""Half Blood Prince"" Analysis and Speculation",So far the book has been very good. I have yet gotten to the point of the speculation on book 7 and what it will entail.
5,Wow,"I can't believe that BOTH Voldemort and Harry die in book 7. I really didn't need that spoiled for me. I was also somewhat relieved to read that Snape isn't actually a Death Eater, but unfortunately has to face the ultimate consequence when his true loyalty to Dumbledore is revealed to Voldemort. Wow? Really? The last Horcrux is Harry's scar? This is some juicy stuff. If you need book 7 spoiled for you way in advance, I'd recommend this book."
2,Purchase with caution,I purchased this book as something to read before book 7 but found it to contain even less information than most websites let alone have anything new in it at all. The author has a small bias towards characters which may also not suit all readers. If you really must have everything HP then get it but this book will not give you anything new that you could not read at any of the four big websites.
2,Where are the predictions?,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. Easily 80% of it is an analysis of book 6. I have book 6, I've read book 6. There are exactly 6 pages of predictions about book 7. Pales in comparison to Defogging the Future, which is nothing but predictions based on evidence from the other books. This book might be more correctly called Book 6."
1,A waste of time and money,"This book contains 2 things: motivational techniques to get you to ""go for it"" in the area of finances and some sketchy details about what and how to do it. The motivational techniques are taken almost verbatim from Tony Robbins's Personal Power series. (I realize that Tod was a student of and eventually teacher for Tony Robbins but pleeeeeeese.) If you want or need the motivation, do yourself a favor and go to the source. Get Personal Power II. As for the financial advice? It is general (very few details) and obvious and has been covered more thoroughly and better in 100 other books. Buy any of Ric Edelman's books instead. As Tod says, ""I could wax cliche-ically forever on this subject."" And he did. The one saving grace is that this book is an easy read so you should be able to dispense with it in an afternoon."
1,Hard Sell From Financial Person Looking For Clients,"Nothing but an advertising brochure from a self-described ""financial advisor"" who is desperate for new clients. His advice is very weak and WILL ONLY MAKE HIM RICH!"
1,Beware Financial Advisors Selling Books,"Financial advisors who write books often tell just one side -- the positive side of the financial products they tout in their books. Some of the advice in this book is better for the author (and his financial planner friends) than it was for me or other book buyers. Too bad since it's MY MONEY that was wasted. If I had known some of the hidden risks and hidden costs of this author's recommendations I would have made other choices from an impartial source (one who doesn't stand to gain bonuses, commissions or other fees from his recommendations)."
1,In Search of the Holy Mother of Jobs,"The recommended age level of 4-8 for this book is CLEARLY a misprint! I have never read such a raunchy, tasteless, and offensive piece of literary filth such as this. Littledog's language and style is extremely vulgar. In no way does this novel discuss women's work, but is instead a chronicle of the author's own lewd and sordid experiences, with only a sprinkling of details about her unsuccessful business attempts. The entire piece reads like one continuous acid trip, only leaving the reader wanting to take a shower after reading it."
3,wrong item description but good product.,"it is not an ointment. when i bought this the product description said:Cayenne Ointment contains: Olive Oil, Cayenne, Oil of Wintergreen, pure distilled Mint Crystals and other herb oils, in a beeswax base. A synergistic blend of herbs, pure essential oils and other natural ingredients for stiff necks, sore muscles and joints.it still says this right now but hopefully they change that. its just cayenne extract in 50% pure grain alcohol and distilled water. they say to take a dropperful but that is way too hot and i'm used to spicy food. but thats why i like it. as long as you know what your getting its a good product and good for circulation."
3,"Kick starter, body warmer",I think cayenne extract great kick-starter to get nutrients from supplement in my system fast.On a cold day I could use cayenne extract in food or drink for a quick body-warmer.I have used Dr. Christopher's cayenne extract for years but recently discovered its many uses and benefits.
1,Higher amounts of cayenne in other forms available,"I admittedly did not buy this in an effort to occasionally drip cayenne on something to add flavor, I actually wanted it for effect. I wanted it to add heat or bite to food in a way that regular hot sauce didn't. This product does not do that.In fact, with the quality of the product in mind, this product appears to have no purpose. I can find any hot sauce for the same price or less than the cost of this bottle that provides more cayenne per drop than the contents of this. The alcohol does not stop the cayenne from being hot, the alcohol mixes with the cayenne oils and makes direct ingestion of this disgusting. The cayenne content in the liquid is so small as to be able to take a single cayenne pill and get more out of it. Putting it on food to create bite alters the taste of the food significantly and not in a good way, and doesn't even give bite.Taking into account all aspects of this product, I don't understand what it is for.Save your money."
1,Bad Book - Familiar Story,This book takes all of the familiar things from the Matthew Shepherd story and turns it into a book about his boyfriend being killed and how he deals with it. The story was contrived but the grammar and writing style were also contrived as well. The way people speak in the book is not comfortable and the breaks in sentences is simply repulsive.
4,ArcSoft ShowBiz pretty much what I expected,"I had a previous edition of this program preloaded on a previous computer, that I lost when I had a hard drive crash. I thought I would buy the new edition for my new computer. It is pretty much like the old one. So far I have used it for three projects, and it has worked fine. Not the fastest program, but I still like it. When you finish making a DVD it asks if you want to make a label, and I can never get it to go anywhere but to a page offering to sell something to me. If anyone else has this, and yours goes to a page to actually design a label for LightScribe let me know."
5,Arcsoft Show Biz,"I had an earlier version of this program and loved it. I decided to upgrade and am very impressed with the improvements they have made.For anyone who wants to make slide shows of their photos or video's and does not have a lot of computer experience, this program is very very user friendly and you will be making your movies in no time.The only addition I would suggest is they allow for you to put music to your slide show, but it seems anywhere to go with this venture you could be copy-right violators. Give suggestions on who to handle this situation."
4,great but not as great as advertised.,"Is a great product if you want to make dvd's. But its capabilities for slideshow videos is substantially weakers and anemic that the product info states. I should have gone with the cheaper software as the transition effects ,templates and special effects were much better. Plus even though this is the higher level/software you can't download extra effects....a good product but if your looking to make slide show presentation videos make another arcsoft choice and save yourself some money."
2,Disappointing,"Although the SiliconeZone products are generally good at what they do, this product has two major limitation. Cakes become very flat on the top, or even take on the shape of the oven rack, because the weight of the cake presses down on the bottom of the pan (which becomes the top of the cake). Although the makers of this pan talk about the even heat conduction of silicone, any baked goods prepared in silicone pans won't brown--or cook--nearly as well as anything prepared in a metal pan.For this price, you can get a heavy-duty nonstick metal Bundt pan that will serve you much better."
2,Stick With Metal Pans,"This is a beautiful blue color, coordinates with my kitchen. However, I'll bake my poundcakes in my old, reliable metal pans. I tried to use this a few times, spraying every nook and cranny with Baker's Secret release spray. Without fail, each time the cake stuck to the pan in a few places."
1,Stick with metal,"I've used my silicone (red) pan twice. I didn't like it either time.Problems I've run into:1) Both times the sides started caving in while I tried to put it in the oven.2) Bottom of pan (TOP OF CAKE!) flattens due to the heavy batter. Since Bundt cakes are usually heavier, I don't see silicone as a useable material for any bundt style cake.3) Sprayed PAM but it beads up and runs down to the bottom of the pan (top of the cake). My cake had grease stains at the top of the cake.I'm going out to purchase a metal pan. I'll be putting my expensive silicone pan in a garage sale. Buyer beware!!"
1,Very bad cake pan.,I bought this Silicone Bundt Pan at a kitchen store and paid full price. I tried it with my favorite sour cream coffee cake and it was a disaster. The cake did not get done even after 12 extra minutes in the oven. I put the pan in the dishwasher like the instructions said and now the pan is sticky and I can not get it clean. I will never use it again.
4,Interesting Beginning - Disappointing End,"I love Maggie O'Farrell's work and this one is added to her mix. The beginning of the story was great and kept me reading but towards the end, the story just stops. I felt that there was no fluid ending. Regardless, I still loved the story and recommend her work to all of my friends."
3,Not Top Shelf,"After reading The Vanishing Act of Esme Lennox and After You'd Gone by the same author, this book was sort of a disappointment. Even though My Lover's Lover did not have a great story to tell as the other two books, it was very well written. But, not as satisfying a read as her other books."
3,Suspenseful and keeps you guessing!,"My Lover's Lover was my second Maggie O'Farrel novel, while I didn't enjoy it as much as After You'd Gone, this was still a very good read.Suspenseful...wow, it kept the pages turning and I was dying to see what was going to happen, to find out all of the secrets. I felt wrapped up with the main character and could feel her emotions as I read, O'Farrel certainly has a way with words.O'Farrel's books are hard to find by me, but I'd certainly keep an eye out for more of hers. She's a talented writer. If you can find her books I'd recommend them."
4,A finely crafted psychological thriller!,"My Lover's Lover is one engrossing erotic thriller! It enthralled me from beginning to end as it told the story of Lily and Marcus's bizarre love affair. Things start out promising between the couple. When Lily occupies the bedroom that was once Sinead's, Marcus's ex-girlfriend, strange things begin to happen. Lily is led to believe that Sinead is gone. However, her presence is palpable. There are some disarming twists as Sinead resurfaces...This novel's writing is deceptively simple. The suspense and darkness are subtle, albeit tangible. The building of tension is finely crafted. I disagree with most of the reviewers here. This is a fine piece of psychological thriller. Maggie O'Farrell is a talented British author and I look forward to reading her other books. Highly recommended..."
2,kelly preston is hot,Ok...this movie is unremarkable and Kelly Preston probably wished no one remembers this movie. But Kelly Preston is super hot and just so beautiful on camera. She is the only reason worth watching...and yes she is strips baked in this movie.
4,Great Bat,"The bat performs as well as the manufacturer claims. I was impressed with how the bat seems to create, or better put, gives you the sense that it corrects a bad swing by making the ball take the path you intended for it.I'd recommend the bat 100 percent, I'm happy with it, my two teams love it, it took about a good 200-250 hits to break it in. Great bat for line drives over the infield. Anyone with any decent power can certainly put one over the fence. I like the end load on it, gives it a good feel."
5,They forgot some songs....,"I think the CD is tight...I'm a huge X-Raided fan...but I think they should've included the songs ""Who is y'all"" and ""Momma's Pride and Joy""....those are some of his best songs too."
4,Great Westcoast material here...,X-Raided comes real tight in this greatest hits CD. He's definitely one of the most underrated rappers in the game.
1,Twaddle!,"Early on (p.137 is a good example) Lawlor clearly unveils his ""extreme Green"" biases. Obviously, he'd like several BILLION human beings to just evaporate (and take their cultural artifacts with them, thank you very much) so that his ""dream of regeneration"" could come to pass ... with Humanity reverting to ""spiritually connected"" neo-stone-age hunter-gatherer bands. It's hard to take an anthropological essay seriously if the author repeatedly throws Luddite tantrums, which are a notable ""feature"" of this book!"
5,This is a magical book.,"I have had my copy for thirteen years now, and, since the first time I read it, I have called it my Bible. This book has helped me to summon up lost teachings of my own souls journey, and has helped me to find my truth.As far as the people who gave it poor reviews, I guess they don't connect to the true, raw wisdom that Lawlor has to offer."
1,Better to wake up from this daydreaming.,Now this is a book i would recommend:Yorro Yorro: Aboriginal Creation and the Renewal of Nature : Rock Paintings and Stories from the Australian Kimberley by David Mowaljarlai and Jutta Malnic (Paperback - Sep 1993)
1,Hoax!,"I have worked and lived with Aboriginal people in The Northern Territory for the last 10 years and the stuff Lawlor writes is akin to the fiction of ""mutant message down under"". Beware, what is contained within these pages bears no relationship to the real thing. Only through learning language and understanding culture through this will you receive the smallest glimpses of the spiritual lives of Aboriginal people. Sacred and secret knowledge is well safeguarded through a strict system of law.I see this FICTION is totally Robert Lawlors dreaming."
1,Voices of Bulldust,"One of Australia's greatest anthropologists, William Stanner, urged people who are inspired by indigenous cultures to ""...avoid banal projection and subjectivism. (""White Man Got No Dreaming"", 1979). Lawlor does both and more. He is an armchair anthropologist who has never lived among indigenous Australians and spins a tale that has little bearing on the real world of indigenous culture. ""Bulldust"" is the Australian epithet for such radical departures from the truth. If you want to really grapple with indigenous Australian spirituality there are better texts by scholars who have actually lived with aborigines. Amazon readers should try Zohl De Istar's ""Holding Yawalwu"" as a case in point. It provides an account of her subject that combines insights into the ""law"" (spirituality) with the mostly rugged and raw day-to-day lives of indigenous Australians."
1,Voices of Fantasy,"Where are the real Aboriginal people, where are their voices? All i see here is the voice of a white man. The idea that he could ""penetrate the consciousness"" of Aboriginal people is offensive and ridiculous. Aboriginal people can speak for themselves and do not need distorted readings of out-of-date ethnographies to represent their cultures (and it is 'cultures' - there were over 500 Aboriginal nations in Australia, too many to be represented by a book like this)."
4,Worth buying,Rio Grande games needs to hire someone English born to go over their rules. Otherwise their games are usually great. This is no exception. We enjoy playing it. You won't be disappointed if you want something new and different.
4,Not quite engaging enough,"Fun game, people I play with like it more than I do. While it is not bad at all, I would also pick several games over this one. I find it gives my mind too much down time-not a ton, but still some. I prefer games that keep me constantly thinking."
5,Death to Monopoly,"If you are gonna buy a stupid game made by Hasbro rethink your inks. They are all the same. Roll your dice; move your mice. Thurn and Taxis and other games like it (Dominion, Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, Puerto Rico, etc.) are so much better that once you play this type of game you'll wonder why you ever wasted your time buying hotels on Park Place. Thurn and Taxis is a superb example of the genre. It's got a good theme, based in history. Beautiful pieces and board. And the players succeed with strategy and tactics as they endeavor to build the most robust postal system in Bavaria. Enjoy!"
4,Love the pens!,We used these pens for VBS as well as for our Mission week. They have held up wonderfully and we hope to use them many more times!
3,reasonable gate,I have a fence and a wall where the gate was installed and it took me quite a long time to get this gate well installed. This is the second brand I have and the best so far but I haven't really found something I could easily install.
4,Only two disadvantages,"We bought this gate because my toddler son figured out how to undo the cheap wood dog gates. We're very pleased so far.Pro:-Looks great in black. Lots of compliments-Wide entry. Others are not as wide-Low step height-Easy install. I didn't even need the instructions (which were missing in one of my gates)-Very secure. My son can shake it and it won't budge.-Requires three steps to open which makes it difficult for my toddler to figure out. 1) Push button on handle, 2) Rotate handle, and 3) Lift gate slightly and rotateCons:-In order for the handle to work properly, the gate requires A LOT of tension on the wall to push the handle closed. If you are not mounting this at a stud, it may very well damage your wall. (It damaged my friend's walls) Without this extreme wall tension, the handle is not used at all and it to open the gate you just need to lift the entire gate and rotate it.-Cost. Must be one of the most expensive, but so far to us, its worth it!"
1,DON'T BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!,"Baby gates can be a tricky thing and need to fit and work properly in order to be safe for your child. This gate did not properly fit in the opening in which we needed and the company REFUSES to allow us to return it because it's outside 30 days. We purchased the gate anticipating our daughter to walk around 12 months, but she didn't until around 14 months and so unfortunately we hadn't even opened the box until after their 30 days were expired. I tried to call the company, email them multiple times and even tried to work through amazon and no one would help us with this. Wish I would've spent a little more, read the return policy more carefully and gone with a company with better customer service."
2,Functionable but not convenient,This gate serves its purpose and stands firm and wont come down but it really isn't made for a busy mom or family. The gate isn't difficult to assemble if you aren't at the maximium width but our entrance way was 48 inched which requires 2 extention kits (142.00 later) the maximum width is 48.5 so tightening the screws is a tricky task you will need separte tools even though it doesn't say so the wrench they give you couldn't tighten anything. This gate was really our only option since we don't want to drill holes and the first steps gate can't be extended this long. Good Luck
1,Watch where you place this gate!,"We originally purchased this gate for use at the bottom of our stairs. Unfortunately, it put a hole in our wall from the tension. Would recommend placing this gate only on reinforced walls or doors. Works very well in the door frame, as long as the bottom ""ramp"" is installed to keep it from shifing with each opening and closing. Difficult to replace the ""ramp"" when it breaks. Difficult to adjust the tension, especially the lower nuts with carpeted floors. We replaced this gate with the ""Soft and Wide"" by Evenflo (much gentler on our walls, doesn't leave marks and adjusts to fit various size openings).Would not buy this Kidco gate again, but we would definitely buy the ""Hands-Free Gate"" by First Years. Similar idea to Kidco, but a cinch to install, very easy to use and much more secure in the openings we want to block. We bought the First Years gate for use at my in-laws house and they liked it so much they wouldn't let us take it home!"
1,Very dangerous,"I bought this gate with two extension kits to use in a wide space. The extension kits break into small pieces. The first day I had it up it fell on my foot and broke into several pieces, we put it back up, when my baby stood up and held onto it the gate again broke into several pieces and fell on top of him. I returned it the next day."
5,"Finally, one that works.","This is a great gate. My husband and I literally bought four gates and returned all four because they were junk. Of course, we started off with the [less expensive] one but we eventually had to give in and [buy the more expensive one]. It hurt to spend that much on a gate but when we saw how well it works, we decided it was worth it. Since you use them for about 3 years, I guess the investment is not that bad in the long term. Try it, if you don't like it, you can always return it. I can guarentee that you'll keep it."
4,Excellent gate,"We have this gate (and one extension) in a doorway between the kitchen and foyer and it is excellent. Unfortunately, the directions were very difficult."
5,great gate,"I tried few other gates before, none worked for long as this one did. I have this gate for the past 2 years and it is sturdy and work great. without screws to attach to the wall, it stays put. good as a child gate and pet gate (I use it for both purposes)."
1,Design flaws. Latching mechanism.,"I bought this gate (and the KidCo Safeway Gate) after reading good reviews. Both had major design flaws in my view. I would not recommend either to anyone.This gate's latching mechanism is too complicated and made of cheap plastic. There is a small button that you need to press every time you open the gate. If you don't, the latch breaks. Without fail, everyone who tries to open the gate for the first time doesn't press the button. Just a matter of time before it breaks. It's also difficult to open with one hand.The Safeway gate claims that it only opens in one direction to prevent it from opening over the stairs. The mechanism used to do this is two little plastic nubs that are insufficient for the job. It was very easy to push the gate over the stairs, with only minor resistance.I am an engineer and installed both gates absolutely correctly.Do not buy these gates. And, KidCo, improve your designs."
1,This is THE WORST seller on Amazon and what a terrible product.,"After trying to resolve this with the seller I am extremely disappointed that this business is permitted to be affiliated with Amazon. I am a weekly customer and always receive top notch service and products from Amazon and the marketplace.The item received was horrible. It is flimsy and doesn't work well at all. I tried to put it up and felt that it was absolutely a safety hazard for our child. There is no doubt that he could topple this and fall down the stairs. After days of waiting for a response, the first response was ""tell us more"". The second response was ""you will have to pay for return shipping AND a restocking fee"".Not to mention, the photo shows 3 extensions and they only ship 2. That is also deceptive advertising and should not be allowed by such a great company. Horrible. Try the Dreambaby products. They are now up in our house and we love them."
4,kidco gate for church nusery,"I purchased this gate for our church nursery. So far it is working out very well. We have had other plastic gates that worked fine but were broken off the wall by kids hanging and swinging on it. The KidCo metal gate opens from the center so we are hoping it will hold up much longer and not be an enticement to kids swinging on the open gate door. The only negative for me is the tripping hazard of the bar across the bottom of the gate or threshold. I have seen other gates that have a threshold more like one in a home. This bar on the threshold takes some getting used to and could be a hazard for someone who is not aware of it's height. The childproof locking feature is a plus! If it lasts longer than our last two gates I would give it a 5 star rating but since we only have it a month, I gave it 4 stars."
5,Solid performer!,"This gate is one of the best I have seen. I searched through as many as I could find online. It is made from heavy gauge metal with a plastic locking mechanism. (There are also a few other small plastic pieces.) It is very sturdy and simple to use. It uses pressure points for installation on the wall so there are no holes or marks made on the wall. The adjustable screws for installing are very thick and not easily bent which is important when you have them fully extended. I use it to keep my large Labrador Retriever in his area. I also have 4 children, 4 years through 9 years old, and they are able to navigate through the gate easily. Although, we don't engage the lock usually. Works great and I have had it for a month now. Worth the extra $$$ when looking for a product that lasts."
5,love this gate,"This gate is my favorite baby gate. Easy to install, no screws in the wall required, and it feels very sturdy. I use it at the top of my stairs and have no worries that it will not hold up. My 15 month old likes to hold on to the gates and shake them, this one doesn't budge like another one we have. I think technically it is supposed to take two hands to open the latch (a safety feature) but after you get used to it there is a way to do it with one hand.I would definitely recommend this gate, we have 2 in our house."
5,Love this gate.,"This is a great gate. It is easy to install and it looks really nice. The gate comes with one extension on each side of it(they must be added on each side. You can't put both on the same side.) The gate is very sturdy. We like that it is a multi-step opening system. You have to press in the button, lift the handle, and lift the gate in order to open the gate. We are very satisfied with this gate and would recommend buying it."
5,Great quality gate,"We wanted a nice looking, metal gate for our doorway into our great room to keep our dogs from going into the rest of the house. This gate is rich looking, great quality, sturdy, and the pressure stems have thick rubber padding to protect the door jam. We ordered an extension kit too. It is everything that we hoped for."
4,Advise people how to use when in your home!,"This is a fantastic gate, however people who do not live with you are not familiar with locking mechanism & if used wrong will break. There is a button on far side of gate lever which has to be pressed in order to open lever properly, opening gate. If this button is not pressed & someone just pulls up on lever, they break one of the safety features of this gate. This button prevents children from eventually learning how to open gate. Once button is broken, gate is still operational, but just have to hope child doesn't figure out down the road how to lift lever on their own -- no button safety feature anymore.****Note: Even though you have advised people how to use the gate -- the button being hidden on far side, people forget it's there when going up the steps & tend to just do what's natural & pull up on lever w/o pushing that button. I suggest to maybe mark top of lever with perm. marker to push button first. Lever is wide enough to do that."
3,"New gate, hard for child to operate",We have a new crawler in the house and she's been curious about the stairs lately. I had intended to order a replacement for our bottom of the stairs gate since we put the old one across our four-year-old's bedroom entry (to keep the baby away from the Legos). This gate appeared to be the same but it is now a little trickier to open. There is a button on both sides of the handle and both must be pressed at the same time in order for the handle to lift (and the gate to open). Our son is having a hard time getting both buttons. Hopefully it will come with some practice--the poor kid has to ask for help to go upstairs for now. I'm not a fan of this improvement.
4,"Super easy to install, large openning","NOTE and UPDATE:This is still a good gate..But make sure you tightly screw the fasteners as much as possible, othersie, liek my 9 month old, kids can open it with persistent banging..Good:-The installation is a breeze. I did not have to read the instructions.-When installing, make sure you adjust the screws to ensure the gate lock closes.-Gate opening is large. As large as it can get.Bad:-The packaging was sad. The original packaging was mailed without any protection. The parts were moving freely inside when I received the box.Wishful thinking:-I wish the gate could open all the way, but, it only open 45 degrees. Extra 15 degrees would ensure that gate can be Velcroed to the wall, avoiding accidental tackling.Verdict: Buy it !"
5,Perfect gate!,"This gate was super easy to install. I had it across the bottom of our stairs within 10 minutes. The locking mechanism is easy to use with one hand. It is to complicated for my 2 year old to figure out. The materials are sturdy and well-made. The gate is metal instead of a cheap plastic. The lock is plastic, but we have had another of these gates in place for over a year with no issues."
4,Wide door,"I purchased this gate because of the wide walk through door. My only complaint is that the bottom mountings are too low for my 1"" quarter round. The gate needs to rest on the floor and would probably be fine if I had 3/4"" or smaller quarter round."
2,Deceivingly tricky,"This baby gate looks like it'd be a good bargain, but the install is much harder than it looks. I am very good at installing things and building things, but I found the instructions almost completely useless and unreadable. I finally got it installed, but it was definitely tricky! Once it is installed it seems to be okay, but is all the trouble really worth it? I would argue, not. Also, beware of the gate which actually won't latch until you have pressure on it. I swings every which way and can knock into your ribs, head, or fingers. Be cautious of this buy if you are at all easily frustrated with building/installing things for your home!"
2,Safety Hazard,"We bought this gate to use with our 13 month old and were very excited not have to install hardware to the wall. It was up for about 24 hours when I heard the baby cring that cry that you know they are in pain. I found her at the gate, both knees were wedged between the vertical poles. I managed to get one knee out but had to put vegtable oil on the other one to free it. She of course was screaming the whole time and her knees were bruised. Very nice design but I bought it for safety and that's not what I got. The company said they just shortened the space between the rails, but I think it's too close now seeing how her knees got stuck. Good luck to anyone trying to keep little ones out of harms way. That's a job in itself."
3,My 2 year old figured this one out,"My mother and Father-In-Law have this gate at the top of their staircase and my 2 year old has figured out how to open it. However, my 10 month old has not had any problems with it. The design is nice, but it was somewhat difficult to install, and seems to need adjusting quite often. We have a spring-loaded gate at home that has stayed in place, but does not swing open. I would recommend this gate if you have a child that is not yet able to climb to a standing position or pull up on it."
4,Works as advertised,Works as advertised. Very sturdy and solid. Great safety mechanism on the handle. The only reason for 4 stars is because it doesn't come with the adapter for rounded banisters (sold seperately).
4,Works for us,I was happy to find a gate that works for us. We use it at the bottom of our stairs along with a kidco y spindle. Not sure what other options we had for mounting to our round staircase baluster. If you have a similar staircase I would say this is the product for you!
1,Buy this gate only if you want a broken toe!!!,"This gate is horrible! Every person who came to my house tripped over the gate or stubbed their toe on it. If you look at the picture, you can tell that there is a stationary bottom rail that goes across it. The rail is not part of the gate that opens....it stays on the floor and sits above the floor in a fashion just perfect for tripping. My mom broke her toe on the gate. A dinner guest of mine (who was investing in our company) tripped and fell flat on his face carrying a glass of red wine. My husband and I had black and blue toes for weeks until we got used to it. Also I had to tighten the gate constantly or it would get lose enough to fall under pressure. This gate is a safety hazard to the poor adults that have to use it every day!"
1,The worst purchase I've ever made!!!,"My 11,5(!) month old son figured out how to open this gate and climbed up at the top of the staircase!!!To begin with this gate was extremely difficult to install.It's not sturdy at all and you need to adjust it almost every time you open it.It's a waste of money."
4,great for protein shakes,This blender is easy to use and makes no mess. I use it every morning for my protein shakes. You drink from the same cup that you blend in. It's so light and small that I take it on trips with me too. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I have not yet been able to find a way to buy extra cups for it.
5,Don't let the Shadow novels die!,"Kay Hooper is such an excellent writer! The Shadow trilogy are the best of any I have read! In Out Of The Shadows, the plot was excellent, although I did know who the killer was very short into the story, but the reason as to why he was killing and whom he was killing was a complete mystery! Masterfully done! Added with the paranormal and a threat of a serial killer who had died six years before and you have a SHADOW-A-LICIOUS read! You won't be able to put it down! I would love to see more novels with Noah Bishop, Miranda Knight, Bonnie, and Seth! Maybe another series just all their own!"
2,Disappointed...,"I had a hard time finishing OUT OF THE SHADOWS. Although it is evident that KAY HOOPER is a skilled writer, her characters in this book felt like paper - no depth. I think the main reason for this is Ms. Hooper's success in keeping the characters to themselves and not reveal too much about who they really were inside. Unfortunately, this left me, as the reader, cold and unconnected to the characters and what was unfolding in the story."
3,I Liked This Book But One Thing Bugged Me,"Kay Hooper has written a page turner. She grabbed my interest right off. I've read all three books in this series and thought this was miles away the best, probably because of the heroine's strength of character.However, in every one of these books she has introduced some lapse of logic that I found irritating. In this case it was right at the beginning. An (admittedly inexperience) forensic team is examining and clearing a body dump site. The body has been tentatively identified as a local teenager by a class ring and a gold tooth (teenager with a gold tooth?) There's a statement about how the remains wouldn't fill a shoe box. But somehow it is determined that the body was the estimated height and weight! of the missing teen? How did they estimate weight from a skeletized body in fragments? That is never explained.Shame-- carelessness like that detracted from a rather good book."
5,Total enjoyment..,Once I started the trilogy I could not put it down! Cannot wait for more trilogies from Kay Hooper.Awesome read...
4,Encouraging guide to following your dreams,"It's difficult to be all things to all entrepreneurs, and much of the detailed figures and advice didn't apply to my own business. However, the real value in this book lies in reading the success stories, discovering how others did it --- and how long it took them! --- and getting some very welcome encouragement to give it a try."
1,Research The Material,"This book was written after the Cadillac LaSalle Clubs Grand National in 1997. Many of the pictures were taken at that event. Unfortunatly, it appears that the author spent a couple of days taking photos and doing mediocre research at best. Many photos are inaccurately described. It would seem that this book was published to make a quick dollar as opposed to providing an accurate history of the Cadillac automobile. As a member of the Cadillac-LaSalle Club, I consider it a joke."
4,Nice little stickers,Old fashioned type stickers. Worth the money. Nice little booklet they come in makes them easy to keep track of. I would buy more stickers in this format.
3,A shorter guide,"This book really consists only of healing on an emotional and spiritual level. I enjoy the channeled messages from each crystal, and this book actually separates channeled from researched material.If you are looking for a lot of information regarding elixirs, this book will be very useful for you. I reccomend Chase and Pawlik's book for those who would like to further their knowledge of the use and application of gemstone elixirs. This book also has a compendium of pendulum charts for blending and prescribing elxirs and the appropriate dosages."
3,Simple but lovely,Very simple amber stud earrings. The amber is high quality with beautiful color and pattern but I have found the settings to be slightly less than perfect.
2,Meh...,"They're okay. A lot bigger than they look, and the stone's actually look kinda fake. Not something I'll be wearing often (in fact, I've not worn them once since I received them about three months ago)"
4,Alternative Living Style,"COHOUSING: A Contemporary Approach to Housing Ourselves is about how people are starting to live like we did in the ""old days"" where whether or not you are single, or part of a large family, each person is important to the community. I believe the the USA will start to see a shift to this type of living because it's cheaper, more social, and you have a built-in ""family"" wherever you live."
5,"Loving Greg O'quin's title cut ""Unh-Unh""","If you don't have this CD, then you should get it in a hurry. I heard one cut ( title: Unh-Unh) and fell in love with it, then I bought the whole CD, and it is ""AWESOME"", (One of the cuts on this CD). This is definitely by far the best I have heard from Greg O'quin. As long as he (Mr. O'quin) keeps telling the storm, everything is going to be great. God has really worked in you with this project. It is rejoicing to my soul everytime I hear it (everyday, all-day). GOD IS ""EVERYTHING"" (another cut)."
3,My View Review,"I felt the CD has some beautiful songs. I just feel that he should try to appeal to more than just 16-24. Some people are a little more traditional. He made no attempt to communicate with those of use who have been in church since child hood. True enough I am 28 and I do like contemporary urban gospel. He came really close with 'Uh Uh Peace'. The entire cd is wonderful I just believe that he should want to touch more than just one generation. For example: an a capella spiritual, a traditional sunday morning song with a foot stompin' hand clappin' feel of his own original words, maybe a country gospel toon. I just feel like he has boxed himself in to one avenue. I don't see the creativity.Make no mistake, I love the CD. I listen to it regularly."
5,Returned Item,Unfortunately my son did not need this book for his class. It was passed the time I could have returned it through Amazon. I contacted the seller and he said no problem that if I shipped it back to him he would give me a refund. I was really thankful on how helpful he was.
5,Angelina and Princesses what could be better!,"Little girls like princesses and ballerinas and this book combines both. The students at Miss Lilly's Ballet School have been invited to perform for the Mouseland princess. Angelina is sick on the day of the tryouts and ends up getting a minor part. She is upset, but her mom tells her to do her best! Angelina also memorizes the lead parts and on the day of the show one of the lead ballerinas sprains her ankle and Angelina gets the chance to dance a lead part!"
4,HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL...............,"IF YOU LIKE STRAIGHT AHEAD ROCK AND ROLL GUITAR PLAYING WITH BLUES MIXED IN, THEN THIS IS YOUR BAG. NO FRILLS HERE. JUST MIND NUMBING STRIPPED DOWN GUITAR PLAYING. THIS 3 PIECE GROUP LAYS DOWN SOME OF THE MOST HARD EDGED BLUES / ROCK AROUND. HER VOCALS MATCH HER PLAYING. ROUGH AND SMOOTH AT THE SAME TIME. TOUGH TO EXPLAIN BUT INCREDIBLE TO WATCH. HER STUDIO CD CALLED "" SENDING ME ANGELS "" IS , IN MY OPINION , HER BEST WORK. HER LATEST LIVE CD "" LIVE, AS IT SHOULD BE "" IS A DOUBLE DISC SET OF BUTT KICKIN' ROCKIN' BLUES. SHE ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE JOAN ARMATRADING VOCALLY SOMETIMES AND THEN JANIS JOPLIN. SOMEWHAT LIMITED IN SCOPE BUT A GREAT TREAT FOR US OLD TIME ROCKERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPRIVED OF OUR MIND NUMBING STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN ENERGY. KEEP ROCKIN KELLY......................."
3,Poor graphics,"In this day and age, rehashed graphics from the 1950's FAA publications are not acceptable. While overall content is average, it doesn't compare to up to date publications like Jeppesen's Private Pilot Handbook."
4,one of the standards to read and know,"a lot of schools seem to have this book around. it's concise and well organized. doesnt cover enough on panel instruments for my taste, but is really a valuable book to refer to for most other things."
3,Just okay,Many actors overact. Plots are weak. Character development ok. Percy is ok. Travis is ok. These are two of the main actors. I am not sad that it was cancelled. Not much good scifi available now so I did watch it.
4,More of a Correction,"Seems this is not season one as noted, but season two. Season one was called Starhunter, with 22 episodes I think. The '2300' portion of the title was added in season two.You can watch season two without ever realizing there was a season one. Just thought I'd make a note of it since I just found this out myself.As to the show itself, I thought it was great. the story is wonderful and I'm sorry there weren't more seasons to watch, but that's always the way."
4,Starhunter 2300,"I really liked the first season of Starhunter 2300. At first I didn't know what to think so I just watched each show until the end. OK so you could see it was on a very tight budget, but all-n-all I thought that it was really good! The ending was good, now if someone can tell me where I can find Season 2 at I will be good to go! The story line is well done the acting is not that bad, and the ship, need a space really bad, but other than that a good show!"
3,Too Long in the Tooth for Season 2,"Starhunter 2300 is British SciFi. There are two incarnations of the show on DVD. Starhunter is the original which was shot with a low budget and really hokey graphics. However, the characters were pretty compelling. Starhunter 2300 is the revamped final season with an entirely new cast save for two people. Personally, though the final season had better graphics and more money for production, the story line didn't hold together as well as the earlier DVD set. I guess you don't really care about the new characters too much and it seemed to drag at then end."
1,"Boring slow, 45 min of my life I am never getting back.",Just dull. It look like the makers were more interested in making arty looking space picture than actually create a show.
2,Not without Michael Pare`,"I only watched the first season because of Michael Pare` and at first thought that it wasn't much. As I watched the whole thing, I became entranced with the cast. I didn't even mind the total lack of decent scenery. I really enjoyed the play between Dante and Percy. I just wish they had continued with Pare`. I just don't think Percy could fit as well with anyone else so I have decided not to take the time to even bother with the continuation of the series.Dragonflyryder"
4,The StiffUpperLips make good sci-fi. Thanks blokes*,"I thought the only sci-fi that would ever come out of the British Empire would be a spoof-show riddled with toilet humor.But I did enjoy this whole series. Especially towards the end, however as the other reviewer stated, production does lack a little, but the stories make up for it in spades (along with the SCRUMPTIOUS Tanya Allen, she is so friggin cute).Basically it's like watching a slightly less interesting Firefly with British accents. If you like Crusade, Firefly, B5 etc. this is a good addition to that genre drawer (fellow DVD compulsives). Any sci-fi fan would appreciate these stories on some level."
3,"STARHUNTER nice package, dull series","First of all, don't bother complaining about Image releasing the second season, the first season shows were licensed by a different company (Platinum) and are already on the market on DVD. Amazon and many other outlets carry the first season DVD releases; do a search. Take note: the Platinum DVD volumes contain the uncut versions of the shows not aired on US TV, which contain some nudity and run a bit longer.The second season is a lot more expensive, but it is a higher quality presentation. The real trouble here is that both seasons are pretty dull and cheaply produced.Fans will likley buy them, others won't find anything worth more than a rental when everything else is checked out."
3,"Good, but poorly packaged","The product works great, but the item is poorly packaged by both American DJ as well as Music 123 (the distributor that I purchased them from), so a couple of them arrived shattered. American DJ individually packages them in thin paper board boxes without any padding. Which is dumb on their part. And then Music 123 put all those individual boxes into a larger box with just a little bit of crinkled up paper. Which is also dumb on their part because i'm sure i'm not the only one who has received broken lamps and asked for them to send more at their expense."
1,REVIEW:,This book is not good if you are looking for grant support for a religious organization. I give no stars for rating!
1,Inferior quality,"When I received these pans I noticed a strong chemical smell. When I folded them between my fingers to see if they were high-quality, the material turned white, which I've read is an indicator that fillers have been used and they are not pure silicone. I would not buy this product again. I did find some higher-quality Casabella ones where the material doesn't change color if folded."
4,Great silicion pan,"easy to use, i am way more satisfied with this silicone mold that with my brand one. quick shipping."
5,LOST BOYS SAGA,I LOVED THE MOVIE. FOR ITSELF. AND I ESPECIALLY LOVE HOW THEY WRAP UP LOST BOYS ORIGINAL. AND STILL SHOW CLIPS OF BOTH COREYS SO HE WAS A PART OF IT. I KIND OF HOPE THEY MAKE ANOTHER MORE LIKE THE FIRST TWO. IF THEY MAKE ANYMORE. I FELT LIKE EVEN THOUGH IT HAD A GOOD STORY. IT WAS MORE WRAPPING UP THAN ANYTHING. I WANT ANOTHER TRUE LOST BOYS LIKE THE FIRST AND THE SECOND. IF YOU HAVE SEEN ALL THREE. ESPECIALLY SEVERAL TIMES LIKE MYSELF. NO LIFE I KNOW. BUT YOU WILL GET WHAT I MEAN. IM WONDERING IF THER IS A KIEFER IN THREE AS THERE WERE IN THE FIRST 2. BUT JUST THE WAY IT ENDED WITH TURNING WOLF ALMOST REMIND YA OF TWILIGHT. BRINGING THE TWO TOGETHER. THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER. IM LOOKING VERY FORWARD TO IT THUMBS UP. DO A LITTLE ADVERTISING NEXT TIME THOUGH . I FOUND THIS BY ACCIDENT. NEVER EVEN ADVERTISED ON TV.THE CHARMED ONE
4,Fast pace action,If you injoyed the original Lost Boys you will enjoy this movie. It was a fast pace action that explains what happen to the vampire hunters chasing down the head vampire. Not a phonemona as the first but it was a good story. I didn't know it was even out. And it filled in some information for the Lost Boys - The Tribe.
3,"It was alright, nothing to write home about, honestly!","I picked up this bluray for 5 bucks at Wal-Mart, and for what it was, it was okay, nothing that made me jump out of my seat. Would I watch it again? Probably, but not anytime soon. The first one was ofcourse the best, the second ( the tribe ) was not too bad and this was just mediocre in comparison.I will say, however, that the bluray picture quality was very good and the sound was excellent!"
2,Nothing like the original,"Certainly is modern and therefore its more of a typical, trash, and over-characterized.Kind of like random serial teenager flicks.So I do not see anything memorable about the movie and no certainly it does not mesasure up to the original.WATCH the ORIGINAL!To me the best movies to date our the 80's while now they ove-buff films, and insert in their perversion traits to ring in male audience,which to me is a sad way to slander an original classic"
3,"If you were hoping to love this movie like ""The Lost Boys"", it doesnt come close!","This movie was okay, but nothing like The Lost Boys. I was hoping for the same thrill, cute guys and great story line, but this movie didnt make the cut. It was a little dull compared. I must say it is hard to compete with the original Lost Boys but this one didnt come close!"
3,;0/,Love the original and nothing comes close to it. But I have to start off by saying is it me or is Corey Feldman acting way off in this it seems over done. The movie wasn't bad basically its what I expected which means I wasn't expecting much. It's a fun little low budget film so it is what it is.
2,"stinks, but not as bad as the 2nd one",Rented just because Lost boys is my favorite movie. This movie obviously doesn't compare to the original nor does it suck as much as the second one.
3,Lots of fun.....and vampires also,"I did see the original lost boys...but i did'nt remember the storyline, onlyremembered that i like it. Now today looking in the bargin bin, there the lostboys:the thirst. So i picked it up, and it was the last movie to watch of the bunch thati bought. Well, guess what, it turns out to very different andentertaining movie. And yes, i loved the ' grunt' one of the frog brothers does.It gave added character and was well done.Great little movie to end a weekend with."
3,LOST IN THE 80'S,"This third entry in the LOST BOYS saga is surprisingly better than I expected. Corey Feldman's deadpan performance recaptures his original portrayal, some 20+ years later. The movie has a sharp, concise pacing and takes dead aim on the romantic vampires glorified in the TWILIGHT franchise and TRUE BLOOD/VAMPIRE DIARIES.While not as good as the original, it surpasses THE TRIBE and returns to the more heinous evil of vampirism. It also has a couple of neat twists at the end. True vampire enthusiasts should enjoy."
4,Good flick. Alot better then the tribe!,Have seen the reviews for this movie and have been wanting to see it. We watched the tribe first thinking that there might be info in that movie we'd need to know. All can say is I'm so happy that this movie worked out better then the crap we call The Lost Boys: The Tribe. Awsome to see the Frog brothers back in action. I wish they were togeather for more of the movie.
3,Getting Closer!!!!!,"Much better then The Tribe. For a direct to DVD film it felt more cinematic then the last and had elements of the first but what I would like to see in future sequels is more Alan Frog with Edgar. Their dynamic in the original was what made them so great, singular Frog is not enough. The scene where Edgar is asking for Alans help against the Alpha vampire was a true Lost Boys moment...it had heart and the acting was good. I would like to see more of that in the next film with the campyness more spread out much like the original. Al in all The Thirst is fun and it gives us the fans a taste of a Frog Brothers reunion!!!!"
1,Seriously?,"I am glad I only spent $1 at the redbox to rent this movie. What a waste of time. I know it is a tall order to follow a classic like the original Lost Boys and make it good, but this was way off the mark! The original movie had so much character development and depth. The storyline was mesmorizing. The acting was excellent. The vampires were the best I have seen in any vampire movie. This sequel was cheesy, stupid, the acting was horrible, the storyline was pathetic, and the vampires were lame. The best parts of the movie were the flashblacks of the original! What a disgrace to the original movie!"
4,an organic chemistry introduction through mechanisms,"A very good aspect of this book is to present the basics of organic chemistry through mechanisms. It is much easier to memorize a reaction if you can explain it by a mechanism. If you read this book and beside work with the outstanding ""Writing Reaction Mechanisms"" by Miller et al. you are ready to start with more advanced concepts"
5,Can't miss hit of the summer!!!,"Solomons' Organic Chemistry is the ""feel good,"" hit of the year. A must own for anyone who's anybody!! Scintillating portrayal of pi and sigma bonding orbitals. But of course, the functional groups take the cake...as always"
2,Buy something else,the spout keeps popping off then loses its spring to keep it in place. for what we paid for it I'd rather buy something else
3,It takes a geyser to make it blow,"Yes, it's cute, that red delicious apple. True. The top is snug so I'm not afraid it will drop off when I'm pouring hot water. But the whistle is so snug on the spout it's very hard to get off, especially when it's hot. And it takes a steaming geyser to make it whistle. But when it does whistle, the sound is like a pleasant distant train, not an ear-splitting screech. The handle is on the side 180 degrees from the spout, which I find easier to pour than a teakettle with the handle on top. I've had it about a year and the black interior coating is beginning to bubble, even though I follow directions and dry it out each time I use it. Wonder what's next with those bubbles. If you're mostly concerned with cute, don't let the few imperfections bother you."
5,Good 'ode Stewart.,My grand daughter started watching this show when she was a year and a half and would watch it again and again. Sweet show for little ones.
2,Only for the Movie Maven,"If you are looking for an hour or so of entertainment (like the video series That's Entertainment) don't buy this DVD. I agree with the other reviewer. It looked like a High School project that made it to some publisher.Because I am really into exploring all of the goldie oldie movies the DVD presented some previews unseen in my movie quest. A rather tedious DVD to watch for those few goodies.I don't understand why there was such terrible fidelity in the film shorts. They were recorded in really bad EP mode when I know many are available in better quality film mode. Like this was made with someone with very limited equipment.Anyway, worth a few (very few) $$$ to the student of movies. For the casual viewer....don't."
1,Poor Quality -- Poor Attempt at Reminiscing,"Worst DVD compilation I've seen and a big waste of time. It's basically a series of movie previews and trailers strung together with narrative. The quality is very poor. This DVD cover and label shows a pic of The Barkleys of Broadway, which was a favorite of mine. There was nothing on the DVD about Barkleys. I do think this was a rip-off and I wouldn't consider looking at the rest of the series of their musicals of the 50s and 60s."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this DVD. I was expecting much more than a collection of movie trailers. Very few songs were performed in entirety and the words appearing over the singers and dancers were very distracting. As I said, it is a collection of movie trailers, interesting in themselves but not worthy of being termed ""selections from movies""."
4,The kids loved it!,"My wife's a fourth grade teacher; her class had just finished doing a book report. They enjoyed reading ""Pippi Longstocking"" so much that, she wanted to surprise them with the movie version... long story short, my wife said they couldn't stop laughing, they loved it!"
1,Not Widescreen!,"I am getting tired of this and positively will NOT buy Edited/Censored DVDs! Not even a little tiny little edit is ok. Another great movie ruined by the suits. This movie is formatted to fit TVs, so the sides of the film have been cut off."
5,timeless,This was my absolute favorite movie growing up. So much that I made my parents rent it so much that I wore out the video stores copy :). I am so excited that I can now get it for my children.
3,Great,"I've watched this so many times, I've got bored of it. But I still loved it. Though, it confuses me at some times."
2,weird weird girl,"I remember seeing this version as a kid. This Pippi is ""rawther annoying"" as Eloise's Nanny might say. It was still interesting to watch, but still, it always annoyed me. There are two kinds of weird, one is cool and one is annoying like this portrayal of Pippi Longstocking. The bottom line? This movie is short on Stocking."
1,Never Recieved,"After the one month shipping time I had to wait for this movie, I still never reciened it!!!"
3,There are better kids movies .....,I knew this is a kids movie. I do not know what I was expecting from this movie but I did not care for it. In today's society I think it not a good kids movie. Very old and dated.
5,Classic Children's Film,"I'll address the one person (I'm sure that'll change) that gave this movie one star. Yes, it is true that this movie does not follow the books. In fact, they're taking artistic license all over the place, but that doesn't detract from the experience. The reason I read the books in the first place was because of this movie. Anyway, on to the real review. It's very light fare. A children's film. I have memories of watching it when I was younger and I enjoyed it. I still do. So, if you're looking for something you can watch with the kids, of if you're a big kid (like me), get this film. And unlike most ""kids"" movies you see today there is no bathroom humor. Highly recommended."
5,The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,"We enjoy all the Pippi movies. This one is special because it's in English, not dubbed, and her father is played by John Schuck who graduated from the same high school we did. A great adventure!"
5,Pippi Longstocking DVD,"Great to find this dvd of daughter's favorite childhood movie; our old one had somehow 'magically' disappeared. Now that she's grown up and on her own, I won't have to watch it, but did enjoy seeing her delighted face upon opening the gift."
3,OK I guess...,"Its OK and my kids enjoy it and watch it often. However, I prefer the original swedish version. The songs in this one are annoying and Tami Erin was a bit too old for Pippi (she has her own website, for all of you who were wondering what has happened to her). The whole thing just feels kind of awkward and peiced together. I am now ordering the original version in the hopes that it is what I remember and the kids don't notice the voice over as much as I do."
3,Not great but not horrible either!,"Though I prefer the original Swedish versions of The Pippi Longstocking movies based on the Pippi books by Swedish kids author Astrid Lindgren I thought this remake was cute though having it set in in Florida, U.S.A. was a bit odd. Though not quite as good a Pippi as Inger Nilsson I think Tami Erin did a fine job and had just the right amount of spunk to make her performance seem believable and I think the movie is worth watching at least once but it's not something I would keep but more like a rental or something I might watch on TV if it was on and I had nothing else to do."
4,An enjoyable film for kids,"My kids love this movie. COnsidering all the other garbage out there for kids to watch, this harmless, fun movie provides some wonderful entertainment."
1,movie,cant be played in australia and didnt say so in the write up not happy I now hav a movie I can never watch
5,Loved it :-),"One of my favorite movies as a child, now I can watch my kids enjoy it too. The story doesn't really make sense but my kids love it as much as I used to."
2,Not what I expected...,"This DVD is not what I used to see when I was child, I thought this is original version. I don't recommend it if you already knew original one. So story do."
2,Decent Movie,"I have to admit, this movie is creative with its portrayal of the characters. However, I get the feeling that the film is painfully low-budget. While the main trio of kids capture their characters, the writing makes them very bland, uninteresting characters. Pippi still has the carefree attitude and friendliness that Lindgren's writing conveyed, but Tommy and Annika both seem to have lost any personality they had originally, and they originally only really existed to be shown as ordinary middle-class children. The storyline is very good, and the movie is appealing to younger viewers. However, the sub-plot of the men hoping to tear down Villa Villikulla feels like they're trying to pad the film out, and it would have been better to leave that out.Overall, the movie is worth a watch once, but you'd be better off reading the books about Pippi."
4,Pippi is cool!,"My best friend and I have grown up watching this movie. Now that we're older, we have begun to notice some of the corny special effects and lines, but I still think The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking is cool!! I know that the way Pippi is portrayed in the movie is a bit of a character stretch, but, quite honestly, I saw the movie before reading any of the books. If it had been the other way around, I might not like the movie as much as I do. For me, this movie is a lot of fun memories."
1,Painful to watch this Pippi,"I was so excited to share this incredible story with my kids - after all, it was one of my favorites as a child. I had fond memories of the original movies in the late 60's-early 70's. But the terrible acting in this remake is downright painful to watch! The cheesy musical numbers are reminiscent of an extended episode of Barney. My kids (10 yrs old & 7 yrs old) even commented that this was a ""SUPER LAME"" movie."
1,One of the worst kids movies I have seen in a VERY long time,"My girls asked me to buy this movie having been a big fan of the books. It was one of the worst films I have had to sit through with them and that is saying something seeing as how they have gone through an ELMO phase, a Telletubbie phase, a Wiggles period, a Lazy Town year and a half, etc. Needless to say I have been exposed to some VERY cheese-ball media thanks to my children....but none of those can compare to this film. Maybe if I had indulged in some psychedelic pharmaceuticals prior to watching I may have felt less like slitting my throat but I don't think so. I would rather stick hot pokers in various orifices than watch this again."
5,Loved this movie growing up!,I loves this movie growing up. I am really excited to give it to my niece for Christmas. I'm sure will like it as much as I did.
2,Pippi Longstocking Movie,I ordered this movie for my daughter because her friend is dressing up as Pippi for Halloween. So I thought the movie would be an easy way to let her know about Pippi. I think the movie has a lot of bad behavior and disrespect for adults in it. The beginning was pretty scary with the storm too. So I won't let my daughter watch it again.
5,Love this Movie!,I love this movie! I watched it when I was younger and wanted my kids to see it also! They also are huge Pippy fans now!
1,Almost puked after 10 minutes of watching,"This is a stupid nonsense movie,where the writer was most likely doing a hard drug. The plot is horrible and everything is fake."
5,So many memories!,"Wow. Last night I was about to go to sleep and this movie just popped into my head, and I had to write myself a reminder to buy it! I used to love renting this movie, and I haven't seen it in years, so I have to buy it! I only remember little blurbs, but I do remember that it's a great movie. I remember watching it when I was maybe three or four when it first came out, and it totally reminds me of being little! I can't wait to see it again ;o)"
1,CHEESY PAINFUL,This film is the dummest movie ever!!!!!!I am THe son of steph. I argree this acting the worst you here. that the girl who played pippi was the worst ever I would rather wacth Barney or teletubbies with my sisters.Yes so dont waste your money on this painful cheesy film and I wished they fired her.Son of steph
5,What a beauty!,This is a top of the line pressure cooker. It is quality throughout the construction. I especially like that there is not a long handle sticking out. I bought it for use on a sailboat and the cooking area is cramped. I tried several receipes in the book included and all worked well. I did read concerns about the rubber seal going rather quickly but I carefully wash it and store it in a cool place and have not had any problems so far. Really like the size and finish.
2,Not really squirrel proof,"All the squirrel has to do is push its head through the cage and it has easy access to the suet, and the spaces are wide enough that the squirrel's head slips in and out easily. It took a while for the critters to figure it out, but once they did they were very happy! It does a great job, however, of keeping larger birds like Jays and Starlings away from the suet."
3,A theoretical book about plant reproductive ecology,"This book concludes fifteen chapters written by different specialists offers a various theoretical points of views of plant breeding systems. The authors discussed about several early unclear or incomplete but important plant reproductive theories, which have been proved or carefully studied since then. The authors discussed every example and case elaborately and objectively; however, it seemed to be insufficient because of paucity of empirical data in that era. This is still a good book for who have backgrounds in plant reproductive biology and ecology, and want to have primary ideas of plant reproductive theories."
4,Pretty darned good,"This thing is excellent. We put it across the entrance to our kitchen, 8 ft. and basically straight. It would be much more sturdy if we had used the extra piece and shaped it differently, but our table is sort of in the way. It does its job, though. Baby can get through. She is 1 yr. old and about 20 lbs. We'll see how it goes over the next year or so."
4,Peace of mind,"We purchased this gate to keep our one year old son away from the fireplace. It was a little difficult to get each piece into the angle we wanted but now that it is set up it seems very secure (despite our son's attempts at shaking it apart). One negative is that we couldn't move the gate over one section. We have a fireplace insert so we need to swing a door open to feed the fire and having the gate opening where it is makes it a little cramped for us. Otherwise, we are very happy with the product. The gate door is very easy to open with one hand, which is so convenient. We will probably end up using it around our BBQ for the next few summers as well. I would recomend this product to a friend."
1,Plastic hinges broke immediately,"I really liked this gate, BUT, as soon as we opened it, 3 or 4 of the plastic hinges cracked. I was very surprised. Then, I was sad to see that others had the same trouble. So, I had to return. : ( We exchanged for the Metal Superyard and have been very happy (and that one was surprisingly less expensive, which was a perk)"
4,Attractive and sturdy,It's a sturdy barrier that's easy to attach to the wall. It's dark color helps it look right at home surrounding our fireplace.The price is a little higher than some other barriers that are bigger and sturdier. Check out the North States 3-in-1 barrier; it's a bit sturdier and costs about 40-50 dollars less.
2,KidCo Hearth Gate,"We are on our second Hearth Gate this year. The plastic pieces that are supposed to swivel when you open the gate don't swivel like they are supposed to and it snaps! It is a great gate, it keeps the kids away from our wood burning stove and it looks attractive given the purpose but for the price, I would have expected better quality. I am going to call the company to see if this part can be replaced or else I will have to make another return. I would give up at this point but I don't know of another hearth gate."
4,overall pleased,"It isn't easy to attach to brick. However, even without being attached it is still sturdy enough to stand against children pulling on it. well made"
4,Excellent for SMALL children,"I installed this around our living room wood stove shortly after my daughter was born. It has worked very well. I did of course add some custom spacers where it's meant to attach to the wall and also sunk screws through the bottom rail to stiffen it up some. We've also noticed with the appropriate 20 some inches of gap between it and our stove face it barely feels warm to the touch, even when the fires BLAZING!My only suggestions to improve it are: Lower the price!, and add some small support brace across the top edge of the pieces that make up the corners. The plastic adjusting hinges can only standup to so much leverage against them."
5,A must for homes with fireplaces!,"We moved into a new home a year ago, and this is the first thing I purchased for it - and couldn't be happier with it! We have a wood burning stove in the kitchen, and although it has a brick hearth to it, I really wanted something to protect our little ones from falling onto it.Very easy to assemble & mount to the wall. Highly Recommend it!!!"
4,Great product but save Money and Time,"Hearth GateJust purchased this gate which was highly recommended by a home safety consultant as being of good quality and durable. Only complaint was that when I went to install the gate sections, (The set fits hearths 6 feet wide by 2 feet deep, and it has five 24-inch sections), it became very apparent that I needed smaller sections in order to make the necessary angles to fit around our fireplace. Upon inspection I discovered that the gates plastic locking fasteners are attached with rivets and don't easily allow you to remove and then cut the gates to size so here's what I did. I drilled out the rivets and removed the (2)plastic locking fasteners,(very easy), cut the gates to size,(5 minutes with cheap hack saw), and reattached the plastic fasteners, by drilling (2) small pilots holes and then installed two small black screws. End result was very safe, very easy, and looks OEM. Saves $50.00 and waiting for a second order."
5,Great Gates!!!,I bought this gate and two extension sections to put around the Entertainment unit in my living room. I have a 10 month old baby and he is really getting into everything. These gates are expensive but well worth it. I also have the 3 sections white gate around an irregular stair landing in my house. Little door is easy to open and close with one hand. Would highly recommend this gate
4,KidCo Hearth Gate,Item is as discribed. Installation was a snap. Needed minor adjustment due to application. Looks Good installed and keeps the baby off the stove.
5,very sturdy and good looking,"this really expensive piece of kid safety is a good buy if you have a wood/pellet stove. sets up pretty easy, looks good too."
3,EHHH OK,"I do love Joan, and I realize that evey cd can't be as great as some of the earlier stuff she did. However, this cd is not one of my faves. I do like ""More Than One Kind of Love"" and ""Free"" IS one of all-time favorite songs by her. But the rest of the cd just doesn't do it for me. I try going back to this every so often and just can't get into it. If someone is considering buying a latter day Joan cd, ""Square the Circle"" is a HUGE improvement over this one."
3,Not her best,"I love Joan Armatrading, and while I enjoy this album, I think it is perhaps her weakest. There is so much other good stuff to pick from."
5,excellent,"We received this item quickly and in perfect condition. We are very happy with this product.KidCo Center Gateway Child Safety Gate 5.5"" Extension - White"
5,Geeky book for Produce Lovers,"A geek in one thing, a geek in all things, I guess and here is a book for all the gardening and food geeks out there. I came acorss those book while trolling the sorting shelves at my local library. It is one of the best finds I have made in a while.Melissa's Great Book of Produce: Everything you need to know about fresh fruits and vegetables is a information-filled and gorgeously photographed tome on produce both familiar and strange. For each piece of produce you get information on buying, storage use and even a few recipes along the way. There are some items in here I have never heard of before and it is great to get information on those I have heard of, but never encountered.A wonderful book for the kitchen or the couch, Melissa's Great Book of Produce will surely expand your knowledge and, most likely, your appetite.Highly Recommended"
3,"Good book, deviates from the initial subject at the end","A very good book on a medical doctor's research in near death experiences. Very good information, but you can tell the book was written by a structured clinical type person. The reading gets a little dry at times. The final few chapters deviate from the original subject and get into a study of cults and the use of drugs for out of body experiences."
3,Great Book...but the author's other book was better!,"I read both books by Dr. Rawlings. I expected more from To Hell and Back. Only half of the book dealt with NDE's who may have experienced Hell. The rest of the book, frankly, lost my attention. The author's previous book, Beyond Death's Door is truly excellent."
2,Maurice has an overwhelming religious agenda.,"The ""analysis"" is prepared to fit the previously derived conclusion that meditation and esp are Satan's workshop.Read this book if you like distortions, bible thumping, over simplification and non sequitor."
1,What The Bible Says,"According to Hebrews 9:27, ""It is appointed unto man ONCE to die,"" and after that you don't come back, you go to judgment. The few exceptions to this are presented in scripture.Death was at one time assumed when a patient had a flat EKG, electrocardiogram. But a stopped heart does not prove death. A flat brain wave proves death, that is a electroencephalogram. A stopped heart may give the appearance of death, but it's just an appearance.People who think they've died may very well have mental experiences, dreams, nightmares, etc. that they can speak of when they regain consciousness.It's amazing how many people want to believe that people actually have come back from being dead."
3,Documented personal experience and research,"Intriguing work which has great meaning and significance in the life of the author. Rather than trust exclusively in what the media filters out for us on a topic such as Near Death Experiences, Rawlings invites all to turn to the real source: God's Word. Although many might want to discern the reality of such experiences from reported incidents, we all would do well to understand our own reality in Biblical terms. Additionally, Rawlings has a fine section on other ""out-of-body experiences."
4,solid hard rock,"First off, ignore the ""goth metal"" description. While some of their past albums have dipped into gothic rock, this isn't one of them. What we have here is a good album that sounds like an updated spin on the kind of hard rock songs that ruled the charts during the early to mid-1980's - and that's not something to be ashamed of. A common reference point on this album is the Sunset Strip rock sound, before that scene went downhill with overbearing power ballads and wannabe bluessmiths. Fans of L.A. Guns, Faster Pussycat, Motley Crue and the like would do well to check this out. Recommended."
2,Let down,"After Devils, I was higly let down with this cd. Nothing jumps out at you, it kind of just blends one boring song into the other."
3,"Where, oh where, have they gone?","This album is about two cheesy songs away from being called Poison's Greatest Hits. I am very disappointed. I've listened to these guys for many moons now and this album is completely unlike anything they've ever done (unless you go all the way back to their Motorcycle Mommas days ::GAG::)...and I don't mean that in a good way. Sure there are a few songs that embrace their dark side (so to speak) but, for the most part, it's a bunch of simple riffs and simple lyrics.Don't get me wrong, I still love them. It's just that this album is NOT their crowning glory. If you're a fan, buy it, you'll enjoy (some of) it. If not, go buy something better like ""Paris Kills"" as your introduction to the band."
5,THE 69 EYES FROM HELSINKI WITH GOTH...,"I'm Lillith69,I'm a huge fan of the 69 Eyes & love everything from them.I haven't been a fan for long but instantly got turned onto them after seeing/hearing Lost Boys & Wasting the Dawn.I've been a fan of Rock & Roll/Goth & Roll for over 25 years & I can honestly tell everyone that the 69 Eyes are great.Nothing disappointing about them at all (; & I will be receiving ""Angels"" sometime between today & the 14th this week.After then I'll be getting ""Devils"" & the Helsinki Vampires DVD w/photography by Ville ""Pink Rock Photographer""my fav song by them is Brandon Lee""what would it be if the river of sadness turned into sea;would there be another thousand stories like you & me? Wanted a heart,wanted a soul more than anything else in this world but we are doomed our flesh & bones...I would never give in! Just like the moon does,we rise & shine & fall over you that we rise & shine & crawl;victims aren't we all!"""
3,Son loved it - BUT... very costly for what you get ... only 5 babies hatched,"This toy is a great idea! Though very costly for what you get (mostly just a square netting with a few cheap accessories! You must buy the eggs separately - we only had 5 babies hatch - and after 3 days only 1 is alive! My son loved it when they hatched, but he is VERY disappointed he only has one left - and he is assuming that one will die quickly too! We read lots of extra information on how to keep them alive - but not much worked! It might be better to keep them in their natural habitat!"
2,Know this before you purchase.,"You have to pay extra for the critters! I think the cost of the kit, toy, etc. is even over priced! Then to pay more for the insects is a rip off!! Someone is sure making money on this one!"
1,A complete FAILURE!,"The box ""Butterfly Kit - Raise your own live butterflies Watch and learn about life cycles!"" is false advertising. It contained only the habitat NO LIVE material! Worse than that, the kit is useless--the zipper doesn't work at all!Fascinations GreenEarth Butterfly Kit"
1,Read reviews first!!,"I wish I had read the reviews here first!! For the price, I thought the butterfly garden would be a complete package. It's not. Plan on spending even more money to get the caterpillars to grow into butterflies. And plan on getting your own food to feed them through the process. If you have a collapsable laundry basket, just use that. That's all you get for the price. On the plus side, the included black-n-white booklet about butterflies is kind of interesting. That part's worth about 50 cents."
1,Ridiculous Rip Off!,"I ordered this kit and was excited when I received it BUT there was no coupon for caterpillars inside! I sent it back and Amazon kindly sent me a new one right away. Now that I have the coupon for caterpillars, I realize that it cost $12 MORE if I want the caterpillars. Let me get this straight - I spent $20 for a tiny laundry hamper and now I have to spend almost that much just to get the good stuff??? I should have read all the information because now that I have, I realize that there is a Butterfly GardenInsect Lore Live Butterfly Gardenthat only charges $3 for the caterpillars. This was such a ripoff and not a good experience."
4,Good product but needs caterpillars,"This product did not come with the caterpillars, we had to order them separately. However once we got them, they were wonderful. Children learned a lot and I even was able to get a video of the butterfly emerging. We released them to go on their adventures."
2,Haven't Hatched,"Praying mantis' are really cool, so I bought this praying mantis kit. It has been about 3 weeks and it still hasn't hatched!! It says.. and I quote: '... well I cannot find the box so I won't quote, but it basically says: You get to catch your own insects!! YAYYYY!!!... NO! THAT IS BAD!!! But, to my surprise, I found a dead mosquito inside the 'inclosure' already! Hmmm, this isn't too bad!But, if I were you, I would buy a similar product except it is a kit where you get your own hermit crabs and you can paint your shells! I think that's pretty awesome. This is probably a better thing for boys than girl though....EEEWWW! lolThis kit is doing well so far, except they haven't hatched yet for only THREE-FOUR WEEKS!!!"
2,Returned this item.,I returned this item as it was not what I had ordered. Amazon quickly provided a prepaid shipping label and promptly credited my account.
5,a classic hawks masterpiece,"five stars becuase Levitation marked a creative shift for the band, charting the course for the great 80's material to come. Also, it is easily the finest sounding hawk lp up to that time, just a great recording period. Kicks off with the rockin' title track and from there into a terrif hawk sequence, ""motorway city,"" ""who's going the win the war,"" ""world of tiers,"" the stuff cranks-close it out with the dazzling ""dust of time,"" you got you a genuine hawkwind classic."
4,It works,"I ordered this because it was difficult to find a 22"" pan at the big box stores in my area. I'm using this with an electric water heater, so it being plastic isn't an issue. If you are using a gas water heater, then do not purchase because it will not be up to code. This is a pretty standard item and not much can go wrong with it. The PVC drain connections were easy to connect and this will hopefully prevent damage to my home if there were to be a leak. I highly recommend this or a similar item for the peace of mind alone. I ended up replacing my 14 year old water heater before it failed just because I knew it was end of life and I no longer trusted it. My existing heater didn't have a pan installed, so I'm breathing much easier with this unit in place. It's cheap insurance and well worth the purchase price, in my opinion."
4,As advertised,Pan is poly and seems to be functional. It will go under a point-of-service water heater under the kitchen sink.
4,Plastic Pan for under the counter water heater,"There is nothing wrong with this pan that was suggested for the under the counter heater but it is too big so I wont be able to use it, had to buy another one smaller so I suggest customers tomake sure if they are going to need a pan to get an smaller one"
3,I'm not sure,"I started reading it, and found myself to be lost. I felt like there was a book I should have read before this one. It seems like a continuation of something else. But, it is probably just not for me."
2,Silly-con!,"I got this as a Christmas present. I have wanted one for a while as I loved the idea of a non-stick, easy to wash, easy to store muffin pan.It's not very non-stick. My first batch of muffins stuck horrendously and I was very disappointed. Looks like I'll have to use nonstick spray to make this one nonstick."
4,Flexible cooking,"I find the pan handy in the fact I don't have to worry about it rusting or the non-stick coating coming off. I also discovered that although it claims you don't need to grease the pan, I find it easier if you do. I spray a little Pam in the pan before I cook and when the items cool, they pop right out. I don't put a cookie tray under the pan. I've never noticed a funny taste. All in all, I'm very happy with the product."
1,Don't waste your $...,"I ordered this item and received the one w/the pencil case, twice! So if you want the pencil case instead of the lunch kit, order here! Plus it's a really, cheaply made vinyl book bag. It doesn't look durable at all! Don't waste your $!"
1,Do Not Order,"Like the buyer above me, I purchased this backpack and recieved the pencil case one instead. I am in the process or returning it and hopefully will not receive the pencil one a second time!!!"
4,"Wonderful series, but somewhat superfluous book..","While the 'Strangers in Paradise' series is about as good as the graphic novel/comic genre gets, the treasury edition is merely rehashing all the editions with a small amount of (somewhat incidental) commentary by Moore.It is really aimed toward those who are beginning the series, and even then I would recommend the pocket books over this treasury edition, which only hints at the actual wonders of the story.Some of the covers and artwork are quite interesting, but only for the hardcore 'Strangers in Paradise' fanatic."
1,What's wrong with Amazon?,"This book was listed as NEW condition. What I received was a dirty book with bent pages and a remainder mark that was beginning to fade. This isn't the first time I received a book under the same conditions and usually I would complain and than I would receive a discount and an apology stating that this book ""slipped through"" and wasn't caught in time.What happened to the days when you were able to order a book from Amazon and get it at a wonderful price and receive a brand new, clean copy of a soon to be favorite book that was a joy to hold while reading . . . . . ."
5,The cat who cookbook,"Very good cookbook,after reading the ""Cat Who"" books,I was drooling for the various dishes written about in the books,then to my great surprise discovered that there was a cookbook out with all of them!Well worth buying whether you have read the series or not,the recipes are superb!"
3,whynotavailableonKINDLE,"Why is The Cat Who...Cookbook (Updated) not available in Kindle format? It was published over six years ago, right? So how're the publishers so pokey?"
5,"It's No Mystery, This Is A Great Cookbook!","The Cat Who Cookbook has wonderful recipes based on foods mentioned in Lilian Jacson Braun's famous novels. I have had nothing but success with the recipes I have tried from this book. Special favorites are the Carrot Raisin Muffins, and the Pork Chops Etouffee that I tried tonight. VERY good, and simple to prepare. Most mystery fans must also be food fans, since so many popular series now include recipes. This book is more useful to me, though, since it has the recipes all together in a separate place, making them easy to find when I want them. Now, a plug for your public library: If you want to try before you buy, check a copy out from your local library. If you like the book, order a copy... (But don't forget to return your library's copy!)"
5,Two saints come alive,"It is a delightful story of the saints of Assisi intented for the young people, written by Helen Walker Homan and illustratd by John Lawn. The oft-written story of these saints becomes alive in 12 short chapters in simple language, readable for young adults. I am sure that a lot of research and exploration have gone into this work. The early 12th century Assisi becomes alive with the castles, market places, taverns and churches. The saints become normal and real, like the everyday people we meet. At the same time their sanctity and uniqueness in history are well brought out. Indeed it is a well-written book for beginners."
2,Poor quality for price.,"I was surprised by the extremely poor dvd cases and presentation. For the price I was expecting all the dvd's to come in a box but one dvd was put in a plastic slip cover rather than in a case. The covers looked photocopied and there were even dents in the cheap cases.As for the content there were some interesting interviews, although it looked like the directors were interested in filming bare chested models, which was a bit distracting from what fashion is really about-clothes!"
2,"cute, litte, charming.... disservice to Sapper","Ever wondered what the equivalent of CliffsNotes would be for design(ers)? Wander no more for this book may be just that. Michael Webb, the author of text portion does an excellent job in capturing the essence of Sapper as a creative designer; one is only left wanting more. The photos are disconnected from the text, on purpose, and too small.Not sure about the rationale for why the editors announce this book as part in a series. Other than illustrating the concept of unsustainable design, (i.e. sloppy marketing) which Sapper himself shuns, I find the whole concept lacking. I wish these installments were all pulled together in a single release."
3,Burtnick was a worthy replacement,"Glen Burtnick did a decent job replacing Tommy Shaw, and Burtnick wrote some of the better songs on the album (the title track, Love is the Ritual and All In A Day's Work). JY's Homewrecker is excellent as is DeYoung's Show Me the Way, but the other DeYoung songs are awful. It appears (as it does on Brave New World) that Dennis has completely forgotten how to write a decent up-tempo number as all he write is ballads."
5,Better without Tommy Shaw!,"Edge featured new guitarist Glen Burtnik who does an admirable job in filling in for Tommy Shaw, who thought he was too good to be back with Styx. Dennis DeYoung, however, is the star player on the album having penned the monster smash Show Me The Way and the pop hit Love At First Sight. DeYoung's Back to Chicago also is strong. Burtnik contributes with the pop rocker Love Is the Ritual and a guitar ballad All in a Day's work. JY seems though to have taken a step back with his contribution, Homewrecker but it does feature some cool DeYoungian keyboards. Even with Burtnik though, it sounds so much more like STYX than the current Brave New World - and as a result did much better sales- wise."
3,a good pop rocker,"This one yeilded a hit single and was a solid pop rocker but I have to disagree that this is on the level of their ""brave new world' cd later in that decade that had the original band back except the drummer who had died of aids sadly. rip. still this is a decent pop rock cd that is not shameful and bad it's just not as great as what came before for sure. But styx and pop rock fans should enjoy the well written songs here even if they aren't on the level even of the much maligned 'kilroy was here' which I think is a good cd actually."
3,Their worst record by a long shot--very weak,"I'm a huge Styx fan, and also a longtime fan. My expectations were very high for 1990's 'Edge of the Century.' Styx had been gone since 1983, their last record being 'Kilroy Was Here.' I had set the standards really high, maybe too high.But I was disappointed with this. Instead of the hard rock, pop rock and progressive rock that made Styx, well, Styx, this was just pop. It did have several moments; I do like 'Love Is The Ritual,' 'Show Me The Way' and 'Carrie Ann' a little bit.But overall, this was disappointing. It's bubblegum pop, not at all rock. Tommy Shaw had left the band (I can understand why) and was replaced by top session musician Glen Burtnik.But this isn't a terrible record, it's just not very good under Styx's standards. It is one of their more inspirational-themed albums.Recommended for the Styx die-hard or collector."
4,Better than Brave New World,"If you want ""new"" Styx, listen to this. It is better than ""BNW"". Classic vocals, KEYBOARDS and more. THIS is how ""new"" stuff should sound (although not quite as strong as the classic stuff)."
2,Not their best,"Styx were famous for big, emotive ballads like ""Babe"" and ""Lady"" but this album doesn't deliver in terms of memorable songs. Show Me The Way is representative: a big number, but neither melodic nor emotional enough to stick in the mind."
2,The Beginning of the End for Dennis DeYoung,"""Edge of the Century"" shows why Dennis DeYoung had to go as Styx's frontman. He has his usual basket of ballads about loving and missing his wife, and a cover version of the rocker ""Not Dead Yet"" that sounds forced, like he ""had"" to do it. DeYoung's control over the record also results in a very lifeless, clinical feel that even JY couldn't overcome with an otherwise great song called ""Homewrecker"". Glen Burtnik and JY steal the show, of course, and it's no surprise that Tommy and JY asked Glen back for the ""new"" Styx. Tommy isn't on ""Edge"" and it the record suffers for it. It's a good album if you want the entire Styx library, and for the JY and Glen songs, but it's also a key piece in the Styx conflict and shows why Dennis has to go. Long live the new Styx!"
2,Edge of the Century,"A decent Styx album, but way too pop for my taste. Their later efforts are better."
3,Mwa,"It's a nice album, but not the greatest. Dennis DeYoung has only written ballads on this album. It is listenable tough. The album has some good songs. These are the songs:Love Is the Ritual(good song)Show Me the Way(good song)Edge of the Century(good song)Love At First Sight(good song)All In A Day's Work(boring)Not Dead Yet(good song)World Tonight(listenable)Carrie Ann(listenable)Homewrecker(good song)Back to Chicago(listenable)There are no real fantastic songs on this album, but this album ain't too bad."
4,"Very Good Video, But. . .","This video has credited both Lauren Bacall and Roddy McDowall to have been a part of it, but neither are in it, along with the other Travel the World vids that claim they are. The shows are very interesting to watch, enjoy and learn, but are misleading to think these two great people are in them."
4,"A great pressure cooker, except for the price","The Kuhn pressure cooker is definitely a top quality product, except for the steep price. The unit is quiet, without the hissing sound and it does a great job in cooking tough meats. The other issue that might be a disadvantage for some is that not all the parts are dish washer safe."
4,the wrong and right way to deal with a warranty issue,"Don't get me wrong I loved this pressure cooker when it worked. After 5 months of heavy use the valves started to leak, so the pressure could not be maintained and one of the handles fell off. Remembering that I had purchased a very expensive, top of the line product; I excitedly checked on my warranty. ONE MONTH! Of course, it is my fault for not noticing when I purchased it, but really ten years on non-replaceable parts is pretty much of a joke. I am about to purchase a smaller pressure cooker and will be more careful this time.Since then I have returned the cooker to the manufacturer to my satisfaction. I have also since bought two more cookers and the one I use the most has a handle that keeps coming loose. I think there is a problem with the design."
5,Very good product,"This is my first pressure cooker. I am glad I have made the right choice. It is well design and made with quality material. I am sure it will last for a very long period of time. It has very soft hissing sound while cooking. That means less nutrition were lost together with the steam. It saves at least half of the cooking time for me to cook peanut which will take hours to cook in normal cookware. Frankly said, this is a cookware that save time, money and the goodness in the food. I really enjoy using this pressure cooker."
5,Excellent Product,"Love the size and the pressure cooker (8.5 quart). I am still learning how to cook in it, but so far the family has been thrilled with everything I have served (pulled pork, spaghetti sauce, beef stew, chilli, vegetable soup).I started off pressure cooking with an electric pressure cooker that only lived one week. I reordered from Amazon and bought this one to replace it. I am extremely pleased with the cooker and Amazon's service."
2,Hot Springs and Hot Pools of the Southwest,"This book sucks! It's an outdated edition with horrible directions, at least in Arizona.I ended up following a pitted, rough, rocky, dusty road in a loaded down Honda Civic for 20+ miles and still didn't find the springs.Stick to the Falcon Guide."
1,crap,"This guitar is terrible.It slips, so it can never stay tuned, abd the electical wiring in it is faulty. If you are tone def, and buying already broken things, this is the guitar for you!"
5,Very sweet book,"I bought this book for my twin granddaughters, and am very pleased. I especially like the part where I can write in my personal promises to each of them.It's a book that I hope my granddaughters will cherish, as I certainly will."
5,Grandma's Book of Promises,This is a wonderful book that any Grandmother would be proud to give to her grandchild. It's full of promises to do the fun things in life with their grandchild. I'm planning on giving it to each family where I have grandbabies.
5,Wonderful Promises!,This book does an amazing job of making the connection between a grandmother and her grandchild. It's wonderful to make these promises and have my granddaughter realize that when we do these things that promises are being kept. It's a book to read over and over and over as the grandchildren never tire of hearing the promises made to them.
2,Sadly Disappointed,"I felt that this Grandma did too many things that a parent would do. Though many were sweet and appropriate, only a guardian grandparent or one that had a grandchild full time for some reason for some length of time would do all the things the poem suggests. For a Grandparent that lives nearby, much of this would not occur. I spend a lot of time with my grandchildren and could not give this book to them. Therefore, I was disappointed in the book. However, the illustrations were lovely."
2,Not satisfied.,"The photo on the side (which I printed out at time of purchase) showed what I thought I was buying but I only received a Playpen with 6 sides (sectors?) and not the extra 3 sides as shown in the photo. The price paid was also compatible with the extra sectors which seemed to be offered, if compared to the price of the opriginal 6 sectors Playpen. Kindly review purchase and send extra sectors.Joana Vieira"
4,Nicely made play pen,"I bought this play yard for my new puppy. Originally when she only weighed 5 lbs she could squeeze through the slats. But after two weeksthe pen worked great for her. It's made very well. My only critisismwould be is that it is not very portable. It doesn't easily fold, and when it is folded it is very heavy to move. I have it set up in my kitchen for a safe place for the puppy. It is great for this.The door opens easily, and it is very sturdy."
4,Nice large playpen,We like the fact that this is a very large playpen-we actually bought an extra side as to make it larger. I can put my 10 month old in this and not worry about her safety. She can tolerate for short periods but if longer she cries and wants out. Overall really like having this at home as an option for her.
1,Not worth it,"I am disappointed, first of all it is one page, not three. Secondly, the amount of information is ridiculous: most of the things are to be found at Dan's webpage! I have not learnt anything new from this bio."
5,Chicken Soup for the Successful Soul,"There are should-reads and then there are must-reads. The ""Games Do Count"" is the latter. It's very simple, we're all looking for a basic formula where the result is success. Brian Kilmeade finds that formula and his common denominator is sports.The beauty of this book is that the inspiration is not rooted in the stories of athletes who conquered their sport, but those who didn't. Success for Brian's subjects was born out of the failure to achieve greatness in sports on a professional level, the benchmark by which we judge a truly successful athlete.Whether adult, or child, Kilmeade's 70+ vignettes show success is achieved through a series of life's lessons. Whether you're looking to be inspired, or just entertained the book offers a bit of everything... most of all a reason why you should get off the proverbial couch."
5,Good book,Most successful people that I know have a background in sports. A history with competition prepares one for some of the harsh realities of life both mentally and physically. This book does an excellent job of supporting this idea. The only other book that I've seen that uses a similar premise is The System by Roy Valentine. The ability to prepare oneself mentally as star athletes do is necessary to be successful in the game of life.
3,Good ideas - dry writing,"This book has great ideas about the importance of competition in building character (a truism of yesteryear that's devolved into the money grubbing, prima donna, drug soaked, millionaire promiscous super athelete of today).I'm reading it to my 13 year old to stoke his dreams and grow a good value system for his life.More pictures and personal background would make this a real classic."
3,"Great Message, But a bit repetitive","Brian Kilmeade has written a book that shows the value of participating in sports from the perspective of many of todays top government leaders, actors and musicians. I enjoyed the theme of sports developing discipline, the ability to work in teams and how to overcome adversity and how participating in sports helps a person develop these abilities and traits.The majority of us have never and will never become professional athletes, but we all can learn values from participating in sports. Th theme of the book is excellent, but i only give it three stars beacuase the material gets a little recycled towards the end, a bit shorter and it would have been worth a five star rating."
5,My husband loved this book!,I bought this book for my husband for Christmas along with The Best Sports Cliches Ever by Don Powell and he loved both of them. He's a big sports nut and hard to shop for so when I found these I was thrilled. I also recommend the ESPN book The History of ESPN which comes with a free DVD with their spoof commercials.
3,Fast Read,This was a fast read but the chapters get a bit repetitive. Most of the stories begin to sound the same.
1,"There is only one ""sport"" that gets you ahead in life.","And that ""sport"" is golf. All this book is saying ( and it isn't saying anything much ) is that jocks have the confidence of arrogance because they are usually good at ALL sports and they know it.Success and Teamwork are mutually exclusive in business as in life. The underhanded rule breaking SOB with all the confidence - he's the one who succeeds. And he does not come away from sports learning any virtue - he learns to cheat within the framework of the game.Nice guys really do finish last."
3,The trance ... still lives~~oakie,"oakenfold is a digital genius. i wasn't too impressed the first time i listened to ibiza. but i discovered, like all trance cd's, you have to get into the cd. i noticed you don't feel the same way about a song when you listen to it the second time. the more you listen to it, the more it gets you. i love the cd. it's not my favorite of oakie, but it is not that bad. Not as good as another world, but good. i don't regret spending the 26$ on it. i did the first time i listen to it, but i'm happy with it, and i like it alot. oakie is still a trance ...!"
1,Oakenfold????,This was absolute junk. This doesnt even compare to Another World or Tranceport. Waste of money.
2,Can't compromise on the ingredients,"As a thoroughly satisfied owner of every other Oakenfold disc in existence, it saddens me to review Ibiza negatively. But as in culinary works of art, inspiring trance starts with the best ingredients, and I'm afraid Ibiza is comprised of some of the least inspiring material I have ever heard in an Oakenfold production. Much of his earlier material is so fantastic because it reaches back into music history to borrow specific pieces that even in their day were inspiring (like the ""song of the siren"" in Another World), and blends it beautifully into an epic mosaic of pulsing sweeping sounds. The choice of treasured ingredients like this and a marvellous sense of hi-kinetic aural beauty are what set Oakenfold apart. Ibiza unfortunately picked some contemporary ingredients which lack melodic structure, inspiration and development, so no matter how good the chef, the entree is mediocre."
1,Disgrace ! you' ve changed man!,"How is it possible ? I have listened to all you cd's and you have been my favourite dj since I ""learned"" to listen to trance and related music. You were one of the fews guys that gave us this mellow music with ups and downs (like other master's e.g tiesto, paul van dyk, sasha) and made me dream with my eyes closed and made me feel happy all the time! As soon as I heard our last cd, its soooooooo commercial, tasteless, proundless !!!"
1,"If you want to be bored, buy this cd!","I listened to this cd once, I listened to it twice and I listened to it thrice. Pure garbage. I have no clue what Paul was thinking when he put this cd together (possibly to bore people out of their minds?).I have since given the cd away to a friend. She took it grudgingly, having listened to the cd once before and realizing what she was in for.If you like Oakenfold's stuff prior to this chances are you will hate Ibiza. Seriously, do not consider this album as its a waste of your time and money."
2,Where is Paul & what have you done with him??,"OUCH. Was he trying to sell out, go for a pop chart hit?Boring. Really bad singing & sampling. Annoyingly simple techno that starts with nothing and goes nowhere. I am heavily dissapointed. Disc 2 is slightly better, but I found I could not make it through most tracks. Paul Oakenfold has some great CDs, but this is not one of them."
2,Uninspiring...,"After preordering this CD on Amazon and giving it multiple listens, I have come to the conclusion that it just doesn't cut it. I have tried to understand the tone and direction of this cd and still don't have an answer. It seems that Paul slopped this together and slapped an ""Ibiza"" title on it to entice you to buy. CD 1 is just a plain snoozer. CD 2 is a bit more driving and pertinent, but has the occasional lull that aggravates you to no end. Please give me some melody, some emotion, something that socks me in the stomach. This cd just doesn't give me that down and dirty dark trance sound (Sasha, Fontaine, Digweed) or that emotional hands-in-the-air feeling either (Acosta, Tiesto, Taucher). It just seems to take the ""overtravelled"" middle road. You can do better Paul..."
2,Uninspiring....,"Whenever trance music is mentioned, it is always synonymous with Oakenfold. And after owning Global Underground New York and Another World, good cds(not great), I preordered this one thinking it was going to be a masterpiece. I will have to say that there are some good tunes, but all in all pretty boring after many listens. The mixing is unspectacular, song selection is quite dull, and once it gets an elevated level it stops abruptly. A style Oakenfold has adopted which flat out BOTHERS me! But different strokes for... I can say too that after seeing many great DJ's play(Tiesto,Van Dyk,BT,George Acosta...)in some great clubs, Oakenfold is very overated. I know I will get angry reviews, but this cd just doesn't cut it for me. Long live the trance temple (Gone but not forgotten!)"
2,Not the everday Oakenfold.,"This is a much different Oakenfold CD I've ever heard. What happened to the mixing like GU New York, Fluro, 2 Years at Cream? This cd is completely the opposite; he's mixing has become more like Max Graham, Timo Maas, Dave Ralph,not the usual tracks Oakenfold would mix."
2,Not what I expected,"I was glad that this was sent to me instead of my in-laws, where I had meant to send it. I was so disappointed that I bought my in-laws something else bcause I was embarresed to give them this product."
4,Nice description of cave diving history,"Nice description of cave diving history, 2 thirds of the books related to Great Britain cave systems."
4,A great choice,This battery is great. I am a novice cameraman and I mostly do action shots. This battery is great for the beginner to the expert.
3,"Good, But Not Great","When 'Days Of Open Hand' was first released I bought it and loved it. After not hearing it for over 10 years, I recently bought a new copy and listened with fresh ears and I can now understand the mixed reviews I've seen of this album. It's certainly worth buying for anyone who likes S.Vega's sound but judging it against the genius-level standard set by her other albums, Days Of Open Hand feels a little bland. There are some very good songs, my favorite being 'Rusted Pipe', but overall the album seems to lack the inspiration I'm accustomed to in S.Vega's records. If you're looking to buy your first S.Vega album, this isn't the one. Go with 'Solitude Standing' or 'Nine Objects Of Desire'. If you're already a fan but don't own 'Days Of Open Hand', you should certainly buy it."
4,I'm surprised how much it's grown on me,"I'm a big SV fan; I own all her albums and look forward to new ones. I have to say, that when I first listened to this album, I was a little dissappointed - especially compared to her first two. But, now with the innovation of iPod shuffle, I listen to her more. Some of the tracks on this album, especially Tired of Sleeping and Those WHole Girls, have really become my favorites. I was surprised when I looked back and they were from this album. I recently listened to the whole thing and it's much better than I rememberd it years ago. I guess I've grown musically, just now as fast as SV. She's ahead of my time!"
4,A Nice Quiet Album!,"I have always considered this album Suzanne Vega's least interesting - containing only 2 and a half really good songs. ""Tired of Waiting"" is among her very best, and though some may find the single ""Book of Dreams"" a little too commercial it's another favourite of mine. Though not quite up to the same standards of these two songs, there is a great rhythm in the melodically relatively simple song ""Men in War"".Having read other reviews of the album here on Amazon, I realize that other reviewers consider the album among her finest. This obviously made feel like giving the album a new re-listen. Though this may not have changed my overall opinion of the album, I do agree that a song like ""Rusted Pipe"" is actually very good.A nice quiet album with the strongest material coming during the first half of it."
3,Mixed,"This album has some real gems, like Tired of Sleeping, Room off the Street, and Predictions, and some really inventive arrangements. It feels like her self-titled debut album in its simplicity and its well crafted, quiet songs. I certainly prefer the simplicity of this and her first album over the sparkly production of Red and Gray.That said, I have to agree with those reviewers who call it her weakest link, not because it isn't a great album, but because her others are perhaps much more brilliant in comparison. And, I find it hard to listen to because the number of depressing songs. Subject matter includes depression, war, hospitals, institutions, suicide. I prefer the lighthearted, magical lyrics of her first album.As another reviewer said, you'll want this album if you're a seasoned fan, but start elsewhere if you're a new listener."
1,Worst DVD burner ever !,I have this for a month now and I have issues.The DVD's burned (at slow speeds)are skipping and freezing in my DVD players. The problem is a lot worse with DVD+/-RW.I have several burners (this is the most expensive) and this is the first time I have issues.I also tried different discs.The firmware on Lacie website was not updated since September 2006.Stay away from this drive.This is a repackaged Samsung SH-162L which costs $30. Is a rip off... I got stuck with it...
1,Firewire Connection Was Messed Up,"I bought this hoping it would cure my busted Superdrive on my G4 iMac but when connected via the Firewire it would freeze any program I was using to burn cd's or dvd's. I thought it might have been a messed up product so I returned it to Lacie and got another one but the problem still persisted.I then thought it was my computer, but the firewire ports worked when connected to my old iPod and even worked when connected to my Lacie external HDD. Finally figured that the product was defective after I purchased the Sony DRX-830 dvd burner and that burner worked perfectly when connected via firewire.This product however worked when connected on the USB port but the burning speeds were so slow that it was just about useless."
2,not real happy,"My hubby bought this for me for xmas this year & I thought I was doing something wrong, until I read the other review. I am having the same problem. My recordings skip in my player & sometimes LightScribe works but most times not. I love the idea of this but am not happy with the product."
2,"Poor Quality Control, Poor Performance","I have been a fan of LaCie hard drives for many years, so I am doubly dissapointed in this external DVD burner. The first one started failing to write either DVDs or CDs after about 5 days. I contacted LaCie, and after several hours of trying different cables, upgrading firmware, different computers, etc., they gave me a return authorization. I sent it back (at my expense) and in return got a second one which was dead right out of the box. The third one finally works - sort of. It writes DVDs or CDs just fine, but many DVDs that mount and play just fine in my DVD player or any of our 3 Macs will not mount using the LaCie. I am not going to waste any more time and money trying to get LaCie to replace this one unless it fails completely. At this point I have no confidence that the replacement would be any better."
1,total crap for lightscribe,I've used this a few months now and the light scribe has about an 80% failure rate. I'm done with lacie.
4,LaCie Support is excellent,"I purchased this item several years ago with the intent of storing family videos on DVD and having a professional way to label and use photos on the disks. I didn't get around to using it until recently, although I did test it when it came in and it worked fine then. Well, because of operating systems upgrades, I was having trouble getting the Lightscribe burner to work so I contacted LaCie support. (Note: I had registered my product upon receipt, so they had a record of it.). To my pleasant surprise, they were able to give me instructions within one e-mail that made the product work perfectly. I only rate it as a 4 start due to the time it takes to burn the images and labeling (about 21 minutes in my case). I just wish it would go faster! It is a very reliable product for me so far, however."
2,Spotty. Really Spotty.,"When it works, it's fine, and it does work a fair amount of the time. But it doesn't always recognize dvd's and cd's that I know to be good. Even worse, it then refuses to eject them via OS X. (That's right, I needed to unplug the power and firewire cable and stick a long pin into the manual eject mechanism to retrieve the disc again. Oh, yes, this has happened many a time.) When it does recognize the discs it will then sometimes just lose the firewire connection for no apparent reason while you're trying to access the disc (e.g. copying files, ripping, etc.). FYI, my OS X install and the drive firmware are up-to-date, the firewire cables are good, and the usual troubleshooting stuff has already been tried. This gets two stars only because it works maybe 60-70% of the time, which is, unless you have really low standards, completely unacceptable."
2,Sherlock Holmes Critic's Choce Double Feature DVD's,"I would not recommend buying this or any other Critic Choice brand Basil Rathbone/Nigel Bruce, Sherlock Holmes Double Feature dvd's. The video is sketchy, shaky, and fuzzy. I recommend buying the MPI brand Sherlock Holmes double feature dvd's tha are also available. The MPI version is much, much clearer and a better video. You will definitly notice the difference!! I bought 2 critic choice double feature sherlock holmes dvds because I didn't have those specific episodes, but now I am looking for MPI brand episodes to replace them. Then I will sell these ""cheap"" Critic Choice DVD's on Amazon.....Good luck...."
5,Fasinating book..,This is a must have book for any student or history buff interested in World War II or the bombing of Hiroshima.
3,For Flash Developers with No PHP Experience Only!!,"This book would be most useful to the Flash developer who has basically no programming experience. While the idea is good - and I always love to see PHP getting some attention - the material is VERY foundational.My expectations were a book highlighting how to blend PHP and Flash. To some extent I guess the book does that. But unfortunately there just isn't alot to it. It equates to about two lines of text: ""Export variable to PHP, Import variable to Flash"" - of course with the slightly more technical explanation to make it work.If you are looking for the technical ""know-how"" of how to make PHP and Flash talk you would be better served searching the net. About 15 - 20 minutes of research and you will be able to cull the total technical information offered in this book.If you know zilch about programming, and want to see some cute examples of how you might use this - enjoy!"
1,Dissatisfied with Sabatier Cookware,"I ordered this cookware set not two months ago and already the ""aluminum"" is peeling out of the bottom of the pots. Unbelieveable!! Or not!! Don't waste your money on this product!"
1,junk from china,"Received this set yesterday, it is the cheapest, lightest,made in china junk I've ever seen!"
1,Junky junk junk...,"As with some of Sabatier's knife sets here on Amazon, the list price of 400 smackers is a joke. This is an ultra-cheapo, flimsy set that should be AVOIDED. There are better alternatives, even at this price. Check out deals on Farberware's sets, some of which are around the same price."
3,Average Set (3.5 stars),"I'm not a huge fan of Sabatier kitchen tools, mostly because of this set. It makes a good set for someone just starting out who has no cookware, and needs a bunch of inexpensive stuff right away. This isn't a set that lasts for a long time.The pots and pans are nicely sized and they are anodized aluminum with a nonstick coating, which is helpful. Makes cooking and cleaning up afterwards quick and easy. The handles are nice and stay pretty cool - good for me, since I tend to burn myself a lot in the kitchen! Just make sure you only use nonstick or nylon utensils with this set, the pans scrape and scratch VERY easily.Another thing to be careful of with the pans - while the pans can go in the oven at over 700 degrees, the lids can't go in over 480 degrees!While I think this is a decent set, there are many other sets out there with higher quality items in the same price range. If this one is on sale, it might be worth purchasing - but definitely shop around before committing!"
4,Handy tool,"Good thumb wheel ratchet, top quality. Get a 3/8 to 1/4 adapter don't bother buying two sizes of ratchet."
5,Flawless,"This thing is great. Very well made, the chrome is excellent, the knurling is great. The ratcheting action is smooth. This thing is perfect and made in USA."
3,Know what you're getting in to....,"This book was manditory for a class and would never have been a personal choice, Her punctuation was confusing, but looking back, her use of grammar and pronouns was very important in setting the scene of a confused family. Gordimer left many open-ended ideas that gave us room to reflect. And what's with the symbols. Only one chapter worth of information could have told the same story. The rest was unnessisary."
2,Not an Easy Read,"As it was already mentioned, this book is very complex and difficult to read. It takes a while for you to get used to the odd style. I think it was a good book for showing the problems and misunderstandings between whites and blacks and the fact that it showed you the daily, everyday life in the village. I did not like the ending at all, it leaves the reader asking ""What actually happened?"", although this is not uncommon in this book. I would recommend this book for people who want to be challenged and want a good read about South Africa and their people."
2,ABSOLUTELY BORING,The novel was overwhelming. I believe that the author tried to use a unique style of writing; however it was too confusing to catch up with. The novel was unclear. It was too discriptive and it should've been written in a captivating way instead of trying too hard to write articulately.
2,"Difficult, tedious and annoying yet makes you think","Gordimer's style of writing is both difficult and annoying. Many believe that this adds to the quality of the story as the confused style reflects the confused state of mind felt by the characters at the time. I felt that this deterred many a reader and because of that the message of her novel was missed by many. She does express many eye opening views on the troubled lives of people in a country in turmoil, South Africa, but this is shadowed by a wriing style that few manage to pick up on.One wonders how this book came to be published, if it were not for a topic so that desperately needed to be showed to the rest of the world."
1,"Horribly written, not believable or entertaining",July's People is a worthless novel disguised by a jumble or incomprhensible words. If you're one of the few that can decipher this book then you'll surely come to the same conclusion I have.
1,July's People by Nadine Gordimer,"As hard as ""July's People"" tried to emphasize the effects of apartheid on South Africa, it failed miserably. The character devlopment is abysmal. However, if this book had a plot, it would certainly be worse. This book could only have been more aweful if the ending had space aliens, but then again, maybe it did."
2,What was Gordimer Thinking???,"In July's people, Nadine Gordimer's use of words are almost confused as the message whe is trying to put across. The novel jumps from section in incoherent section. A horrible representation of how it was like in South Africa. Be like the characters and stay away from this book."
1,Oh my goodness!!!!,"There is actually a book WORSE than the Grapes of Wrath!! I wouldn't have believed it possible, but here it is. It starts out pretty confusing. Eventually, I managed to piece out what was going on and realized that there are no quotation marks, just ""--"". That would be tolerable in a better book, but here it just added to the annoyance caused by the book's existing at all. Aside from that Nadine Gordimer doesn't seem to understand the concept of a complete sentence. This gets tedious. As for the story itself, it was disgusting! I mean...EEW!! And besides that, did anything ever happen? They hung around a lot and maybe some people did some stuff. Really, it lulled me into a kind of stupor. If I ever decide this is a good book, please shoot me.And in summary: EEEW!"
1,This book BLOWS!,This book is the last one I would ever read in my life! Gordimer made absolutely no sense!
1,Old Yeller,"Overrated (good?), Overpriced ($4.00 for a book that originally cost $4.99 40 years ago, before the pages turned to not only yellow, but closer to Brown Mustard Yellow), and dog-eared tells me that your quality rating criteria need to be reviewed. This copy would have been hard pressed to draw 50 cents next weekend when our local library has its periodic used book sale."
1,boring ...........,"stay well away from this book and the rest of Hofmeyrs books , this is probably the most boring and uneventful book i have ever read . I kept reading on thinking something would actually happen (most eventful thing in this book is when they arrive in the village , from here on its just downhill) before i knew it i had read the whole book , worst part is i will never get those 5 hours i spent reading this book back ."
4,A Clarification,"Just thought I'd clarify that the ""dashes"" that reviewers have been referring to are in fact the standard for marking dialogue in South Africa and, I might add, many other countries.Gordimer's novel is, I think, a great work of literature that deserves to be read as much for its style and attention to detail as for its touchy and still-applicable subject matter."
5,I like the story,"Nadine Gordimer's July's People is a challenging work on race relationship in Apartheid South Africa from the colour-blind angle that allowed light to settle on the sweet energy of a progressive South Africa . The dream of a rainbow nation must have cannot be dissociated from this book. Gordimer joined the ranks of Achebe, Chando and Patton in contributing to Africa's jolting literature. In different ways, July's People also reminds me of Disciples of Fortune and A Blade of Grass, that stand out as African novels with story lines that act as wake up calls. This insightful novel is a classic."
3,"Fascinating, but flawed","I really had to make an effort to figure out her sentence syntax and structure. It's unconventional to say the least (and sometimes just plain ungrammatical). But the story itself is fascinating and kept me riveted.I kept thinking what it would be like to be plucked from my comfortable, secure middle class life and dropped into the African bush.In that way, the success of the book for me, particularly in light of its unsatisfactory ending, had more to do with getting me to think about the situation rather than the book itself. I'm not sure if that makes sense to you, but it's the only way I can describe it.Bottom line is that I kept reading (if it had been really bad, I would have discarded it on page 5) and the impressions it made will stay with me a long time. And I may even give Gortimer's other books a try. But I still couldn't give it an unqualified recommendation."
4,Great book because it is confusing.,This book is great because of how Nadine Gordimer shows the reader how the characters feel through her writing. The reader feels the same way that the characters and experiences the same things that the characters do. The only qualms I have about the book are the use or shall I say the way that quotes are not used. This leads to some confusing reading but if you wish to enjoy a good book this is it because of its thought provoking material and controversial topics.
3,Nothing happens,"There are no interesting events in the story. There is no ending. Nicely written, but nothing happens."
1,AVOID!,"This must be the most forgettable book I've ever read. That's because it lacks a sense of real feeling, empathy or humanity. The required ""suspension of disbelief"" is impossible in Gordimer's fiction. Stated plainly: it's not about real people or situations, it's not believable and the punctuation really adds to the overall irritation. It is said that very few people ever force themselves to finish a Nadine Gordimer novel, and July's People shows why."
1,Ugh.,"I think irridium said it most articulately, but I just wanted to add to the hate for this book. I have never experienced such a strong visceral negative reaction to any work of literature. Save yourself some time and read Nabokov's Ada instead."
3,Not Gordimer's Best,"This is not my favorite Gordimer book, but it does capture an important pivot point in South Africa's history with interesting characters. The mood of that country when this was written was desperate and that need for human connection against terrible odds comes across in every interaction and on every page."
4,AMY SPREADS HER WINGS,"Amy Grant's emergence into the pop music scene took off with the release of HEART IN MOTION. Despite a mutiny of her devoted Christian fans, 5 hit singles were culled from this album, establishing her as possibly a new Olivia Newton-John. Her whispery yet strong voice, her girl next door image and smart producers combined to make HEART a guilty pleasure. Her up-tempo tunes (except the inspiring YOU'RE NOT ALONE and the New Wavish HATS) are musical cotton candy. The strongest tracks: the heartfelt THAT'S WHAT LOVE IS FOR; the haunting and potent I WILL REMEMBER YOU; HOW CAN WE SEE THAT FAR and the inspirational HOPE SET HIGH.I've often wondered why Christian artists are considered musical traitors but when pop artists like Elvis and Donna Summer go gospel, that's considered perfectly okay. Double standard?At any rate, Grant's pop foray is a pleasant musical frappe."
3,Breaking out onto the mainstream,"The more upbeat hits like ""Baby, Baby"" and ""Good for me"" are good, but Amy shines on the ballads ""I will remember you"" and ""That's what love is for"". The lyrics are a bit light, but still deeper than what you normally find in dancey pop music."
4,Cool,GREAT CD FOR A SUMMER PARTY OR ROAD TRIP.WWW.STREETALLIANCE.COM TO FIND OUT HOW TO PROMOTE CHRISTIAN ARTISTS.
2,"Some good music, but not for the non-Christian","I really like the song 'I Will Remember You', I think it's one of the most beautiful ballads ever recorded. The rest of the album is way too heavily religious. Christian people probably like this music: I don't."
4,This CD is one of Amy's Best,"In all songs, the music itself influences me more than the words, but it's great to be able to sing along. Though few of the songs on this album are directly about Christ, they are all pure and fun! My personal favorites are ""That's What Love Is For"", ""You're Not Alone"", and ""Hats"". This is one CD I've had for a long time and it never gets old!"
5,Very good,"If you are an Amy Grant fan, you probably have this CD. It is very popular. My favorites are ""Baby Baby"" and ""I will remember you."" I have had this CD forever and I am still not tired of it."
4,"Amy ""grows up"" in this album","This album is one of my favorites because Amy moves beyond ""Jesus has all the answers"" to more complex and adult statements of faith. ""How Can We See That Far"" is a perfect example. Amy admits her doubts and fears about marriage and childbirth; but it's still clear she is relying on God's sustaining hands.Not all of the album has this mature outlook; ""Ask Me"" is frustratingly simplistic. Some of the songs seem just for fun, like ""Hats"" and ""Galileo"". Overall, though, this is a good album. It's nice to see that Amy's music has matured along with the rest of her."
3,So-so music,"A member of my family bought this CD a long time ago so I had to listen to it a lot. Recently, however, I listened to it again and found that there were a couple of songs I liked, and some okay ones. But I just generally don't go for this type of music.But the real problem with the CD is that Amy Grant has a very small range--not a lot of notes she can hit, so you just hear the same notes over and over and over and over and over...you get the picture.But she isn't bad, she just needs work."
3,Good Pop CD,"This is a good ""Pop"" CD from Gospel Artist Amy Grant. Allot of of good songs as well. A must have to any Amy Grant fan"
4,Original,"This CD showed how original and talented Amy Grant is. Although I don't care for her personal life, I really enjoyed this album. Good music and great lyrics make up this pop/adult contemporary album. My favorite songs are ""Heart In Motion"", ""Galileo"", and ""You're Not Alone"".I would also recommend:Avril LavigneMichelle BranchVanessa Carlton"
4,Excellent collection,"Some of her best songs are on this album: That is what Love is For, I Will Remember you, Every Heartbeat, etc... There were a few I didn't care for, but this is still a terrific CD and well worth buying."
4,Hits with inspiration,"Thanks mainly to the trans-Atlantic No 1 hit 'Baby Baby', this album is one of Amy Grant's most popular.Known more for her gospel/pop work, which has earnt her Grammy awards and record sales in excess of 10 million, Grant can expect wider attention with 'Heart In Motion'. This is a typically bright effort with most of the tracks potential hit singles. 'Ask Me', about a girlriend who was sexually abused as a child, and the ballads 'That's what Love Is For' and 'How Can We See That Far' show Grant at her best. 'Galileo' is an excursion into funk/jazz fusion and 'Hope Set High', the most overt proclamation of her Christianity on the album, is one of the best tracks.Grant's faith might have her thinking about the hereafter but the success of 'Heart In Motion' has probably forced her to handle some more immediate and wordly rewards."
2,Not as good as free AVG anti virus and free Zone Alaram Internet Security,"I have been using Zone Alarm Internet Security and AVG Anti Virus for 4 years and I was so happy. First time, I have bought this CA internet security bundle which comes with Internet Security, AntiVirus and Spyware.Pros:Installation is very smooth.Cons:While CA internet security is running, I have found the following issuesFirefox takes 100% CPU when CA firewall is running. I can't shutdown gracefully and I had to shutdown forcefully by holding the power button.Lots of ebay pages are not working properly from MyEbay page. While bidding, the firefox is trying to download the xxx.dll instead of running it on the server.Everytime, I have to add new website into the privacy -> manage websites to make all link work properly.Opening security center takes 100% of the CPU."
4,Unique individuals,"when i couldn't find this very popular stlye, i turned to amazon. there itwas! it is a must have for kathy bag collectors. i have received many compliments and questions where i bought it. it has lots of space and isamazingly light. the silver realy pops."
5,Hermann,"A very interesting exposition on Norwegian culture is perhaps the lesser strength of 'Hermann'. More importantly is this book more moving, uplifting and entertaining than much else that can be read about Norway. I'd recommend this to those who have no interest in Scandinavia and would suggest it as a must-read for those who have."
3,Hart has done better,"I'm a devoted Catherine Hart reader. This isn't her best book by all means, but it is worth a read. Charity is attacked and her world is shattered. Her husband is killed, while she is brutally beaten and raped. She meets the hunky hero, a notorious gunslinger and convinces him to train her how to be a gunslinger also. While, she isn't the best gunfighter, and is entirely nervous hunting her attackers, she still manages to kill them. It is also silly at times how she keeps getting hurt or near-death scenarios happen to her. She is a strong character, but I liked the male hero better. She just seemed silly at times, where I just wanted to shake her and tell her to ""get real."" Overall, she is a tough cookie, but the love scenes are very lacking. I think Catherine Hart could have done more. Good one time read only."
1,Really terrible experience,"I ordered this pressure cooker set from Amazon. When I received the shipment, one glass lid was missing in the package. Two handles for the glass lids were also missing. I contacted Amazon. Amazon said it is easier to directly contact the manufacturer for parts. After I told Amazon to account for its mistake to strength out the problem with its supplier, Amazon promptly shipped me a replacement. To my surprise, Amazon shipped two class lids but forgot to ship lid handles this time. I was really speechless and I didn't believe 3rd time is the charm. I cancelled the order to get refund. Be aware of ordering any thing in ""Set"" from Amazon."
2,Rusty inside in less than a year...,"I thought this kettle was so cute, I ordered it and couldn't wait to have it in my kitchen! When it came, I hand washed it and tried it out. Worked great, and I loved the harmonic whistle. I never left water in it, and washed it by hand every so often. The enamel started to chip off, and the steel started to rust. Very disappointed that I cannot use it for human consumption, now it just boils water to put in my steam cleaner until I buy a new one. I'm going for stainless inside this time, no enamel!"
3,Cute but no whistle,"I bought this for my sister, because she asked for a whistling tea kettle, and I thought it looked darling. I give it 5 stars for appearance, but it never whistled. If you're near the kitchen, you'll probably know when its boiling from the little rattling sound and the gush of steam, so it's not a total loss. If you're ok without the whistle, it's very cute!"
3,nothing special,"It's too expensive, really, but we got it for the novelty. It does the job. We received one that did not whistle, but the company sent a replacement whistle for no charge and no questions asked. I was glad to see that, but it also made me think that this is not an uncommon problem. Take my advice and get something cheaper."
4,Stawberry Teakettle,SO cute! Also it does not have that annoying kind of whistle that most tea kettles have. Instead it is a lower pitch.
3,Decorative Kettle,This is a really pretty kettle to keep on top of the stove. I'm disappointed that it does not whistle - very disappointed!
4,take-it-with-you bible,"the notion of breaking the bible back into books (and tiny ones at that) is refereshing. while typographically nothing to marvel at, they are much easier to lug around than moser's beautiful but daunting pennyworth-caxton edition. the introductory notes give the texts spiritual and historical context without spoiling the majesty of what follows."
5,"If You Admire James, Twain, Tolstoy, or Zola--Read This!",This title should be on the syllabus of every American lit class. Read it and you'll realize that the canon is as full of holes as a chuck of swiss cheese.
2,"Interesting, yet overall rather tedious.","This book is very interesting in its portrayal of life among the various social classes in New York in the 1880's. However, much of it is very slow reading, with pages and pages devoted to little action. The plot is quite shallow, and although a message does get across, it takes forever for it to reach the reader. Only read this book if you have TONS of time."
2,Boring....,Boring .... How can a man that writes some of the greatest books on African Hunting be in such a boring film. I buy hunting film to see hunting and not walks in the brush and when you get up to the shot they cut to a still photo of the hunter standing next to the game.... BORING! The only part of the film I liked is when a hippo comes running by and .... Well if you spend your money for the film you will see it....
5,Memorable Characters,"I really enjoyed this book, the characters, the references to Penn State University, and the suspense. I am really looking forward to Paul's next book!"
4,good game but requires more componants,This game was fun but you really need to buy the light gun for the playstation to play the first person shooter.
3,Die harder...three packed loaded missions,"This game is great,john mclane hitting the paint -loaded terrorists,I recommend you should buy this and die hard trilogy 2.Hint : Look up cheat codes on computer for extra fun!"
2,"no animal noises, just really banal sangs","When my toddler went into his ""moo"" ""woof"" ""quack"" stage, I wanted to get him a video which showed the animals and gave their sounds. This video was a big disappointment. There are less than 30 seconds of animal noises out of a half-hour video, and instead we are forced to listen to wooden, mechanical, forced rhymes, DUMB DUMB songs. ""Uncle Larry's Farm, where the animals have such charms"" just an example.Cute animals and pretty farm"
5,Goonies!!,"Great Movie. It's unfortunate how the magic sometimes goes away when you rewatch a film from your childhood... nonetheless, still a good time."
5,A classic...,"This is a great movie from my childhood, that is still enjoyable to watch. I am looking forward to introducing my kids to it. great 80s soundtrack, characters, plot. So much fun!"
5,Goonies = awesome,"Hellooooooo, great movie! This should be in everyone's home. Awesome kid and family movie about treasure, adventure and kids grabbing some independence. What recent movie had this stuff? All I see now is violence, bullying, smart ass disrespectful kids on tv who dress like adults and aren't really kids but mini adults who I'd never like in real life and do not want my kid to emulate. Enjoy that rant? Well I'm right :)The Goonies is an amazing movie!"
4,Long time favorite,I have loved this movie since it first came out and now my kids enjoy it.This is a movie you will never get sick of watching.
5,Never say die,I remember watching this movie a lot back in the day. A two parent household including kids are going to be basically forced out of where they live unless they raise the money they need to give to their landlord. One of the young men in the film stumbles upon a treasure map and a treasure hunt ensues. The map needs to be decoded as it's written in Spanish. The gang finds themselves at a unsuspecting little bar which is actually where the treasure is. They must navigate through various boobie traps in order to reach their treasure. I enjoyed the friendship and relational issues throughout the movie. I thought it was really good.
5,AYYEEEYOOUUGUUYYSSS,"This is hands down my favorite movie. I rented it to watch with my girlfriend, and although she didn't get it, it was definitely fun to watch with her. This is a great movie for anyone, no matter what kind of movies you're into. :)"
5,The Goonies,"Our family have really enjoyed ""The Goonies"" It has long been one of our all time favorites. We watch it at least once a month."
4,"Good Movie, Needs a Digital Copy","Great classic movie, looks pretty good on BluRay, but not the best I've seen. Interesting features included in the box, but I just wish it had included a digital copy."
5,The Goonies,"This is a good quality DVD of a GREAT kid's adventure. I was a little frustrated at some crassness in the beginning, but on the whole it is a good film."
4,The Goonies R' Good Enough!,"""the Goonies"" is a great flick. It is filled with thrills, chills and laughter. All of the children actors are great. The first time I saw this movie I was rolling with laughter. The DVD is great and the best part is the special features. However, I wish they would've left in the ""Octopus"" scene, it was great! ""The Goonies"" is a great movie not to be missed. Kids and adults will love it!"
3,The Goonies by Mark Phillip Stassen,"The Goonies (1985) Dir,Richard Donner Starring, Josh Brolin,Corey Feldman,Sean Astin , Martha Plimpton , Keri Green. A group of goons attempt to enjoy ,what could be their last adventure together. They find a treasure map , and investigate in what could be hidden treasure from the Spanish Armada, but there is one crucial flaw, The Frattelis' a family of ex-cons,who discover their plan and attmept to claim the treasure for their own. This movie definitely epitomizes teen life in the 80's and will hopefully grab the attention of a new audience.Definitely not dated,spectacular sets,effects,backdrops.A bit to much yelling though! but thats the goons for you ! Recomendations Indiana Jones 1,2,3. (1980-89) Stand By Me (1986) Masters of the Universe (1985) Hook (1993) Star Wars (1977-00) Just to name a few. Mark Phillip Stassen ."
3,How much???,I love this movie.. have watched it hundreds of times and never got tired of it... am glad that its on blu-ray BUT why this much for a single movie????? Cmon Amazon I know you can do better than that!
3,The Goonies,"The movie is really cute, but the language was very unexpected for PG rating. I had seen this movie back in the 80's and thought it was really funny, but guess that was before I watched it with kids! The children in the movie are the ones that use the inappropriate words, not really want I wanted my kids hearing. This will not be a movie that I keep on the shelf for them to have access to. I recommend renting before buying if you can find it."
1,Goonies DVD damaged,I bought the Goonies movie for my husband who loves this movie. Unfortunately the DVD keeps skipping. Amazon does not take back dvds. It was supposed to be a new copy.Buyer beware!!!
1,Not a Family Movie,"Don't believe the PG rating. This movie came out before PG-13 was around and should be changed to PG-13. This is not a Family Movie. In the first 10 minutes there are several curse words, several drug references and sexual comments. This is not a family movie."
3,Bleah,"What an obnoxious, irritating bunch of loud, spoiled, whiny little kids. I know this is a dearly-beloved film for a whole generation of Reagan-era Americans, but yuck. These characters aren't people I feel a need to spend much time with. Also, what's with all the bad acting? And why couldn't the older brother just pump the air back in his tires, instead of stealing a baby bike from some little girl? Oh, right: it's supposed to be funny. How could I have missed that? (Axton)"
1,what the reviews DID NOT TELL ME,"I ordered this movie because I am looking for movies for my kids that are more mature than the Disney cartoons but still wholesome. I read the reviews for this movie and it semed like a winner. Within the first 5 minutes of the movie there was foul language by the KIDS in the movie, reference to drugs, and a small stutue of a naked man with an erection. I turned it off VERY ANGRY that I had wasted my money on this garbage. This is supposed to be a kid movie -- there is no way I would let my 7 year old watch it. Wish there was less than 1 star to rate it."
1,horrible...no stars,this dvd was trash...it would not play on any dvd player...it was bogus...dvd...goonies...i was ripped off and when i tried to follow up with amazon i got no help...will never use amazon again
1,a crappy movie.,"How can anyone stand this drivel? I do not get the cult love for this horrible excuse for entertainment.I would rank this as the worst movie I have ever been subjected to recurring snippets of and quotes from. Once through of this would be worse than watching ""walk tall"" 8 times in a row. Worse even than watching the home shopping network for 24 hrs with your eyes forced open and unable to turn your head away, while being force fed a blended mixture of spam, Strawberry Torani Syrup and Wintergreen tic-tacs. Blech. If only I could forget every part of this movie, my life would be slightly improved."
3,Fun for most of the family,"This is a classic from my youth. I showed it to my kids and they liked it but it does feel a little dated. Also, I don't remember there being so much mildly offensive language. I cringed through a lot of it with my 7 and 8 year old kids."
5,Hilarity,"Goonies has been one of my favorite movies since childhood which is probably one of the reasons I love it so much and can find no fault with it at all. Basically, Goonies is an Indiana Jones for kids but the adventure isn't halfway around the world it's in your own backyard. The movie always gave me hope that maybe there is more to my boring neighborhood than meets the eye."
5,Hey You Guys...,"I grew up with this movie, so Im a little bit biased. However, I have not met too many people who did'nt enjoy it. Its just a good time, feel good movie."
5,The only thing we serve here is tongue. You boys like tongue,"This is an 80s masterpiece. It's a comedy adventure about a group of young boys and a few girls who go on an adventure to find the hidden treaure of legendary pirate ""one eyed willey."" Along the way they encounter many obsticals such as booby traps and the Fratelli family, who are counterfeits and murderers. Slong the way there is much to be laughed at and some to learn. If you don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you."
3,"Love the movie, but the transfer was less spectacular.","I've always loved the Goonies movie, and I'll save the review of the movies to the countless others that have done so before me. instead, I prefer to focus on the transfer itself. The video ""was good enough for me"" (rim-shot), but the audio was poor to say the least. It was flat and lacked depth. Very disappointing. If your watching it through a TVs speakers, you might not even notice, but those with high-end Home Theatre systems will come away wanting more from the audio mix."
5,Packaged To The Hilt,"This just came in the mail. I was expecting to have merely a wonderful blu-ray disc. There's so much more included. A removable slip around the box depicts the board game, reproductions of magazines, and a storyboard card set (all included). Vivid photos throughout all the packaging, along with informative material in one of the magazines about what the stars have been involved with since the movie. The earlier dvd has a unique visual commentary option while you watch the movie. Often, the camera will show a picture within picture of the stars watching along with you... and I do mean watching along with you. There's a sense of fun while they reminisce with each other. That's a rare feature, basically the only time I've seen something like that."
5,WHY YOU SHOULD BY THE GOONIES DVD NOW!,One of my favs. it's an 80's teen movie and I love it. About a group of misfits on an adventure of a life time. The movie is funny and full of suspence. If You don't like this movie you are really trully crazy and in denile! The Goonies I give 5 STARS!~Hey You Guys!!~
3,gooniefan,"I love this movie, but am disappointed with the version on DVD. It should've been the ""disney"" version with the extra footage added into the movie......the ultimate cut version it should've been. However, I do love the film and love the fact that the deleted scenes were included, as an extra..... both Cyndi videos are fantastic and I am glad Part one and two are included. I would've rated this higher had it been a version, like the disney one, that contained ALL the scenes."
4,Gloomiest,Has tons of replay value! Watched it with my kids on a rainy day around holloween and they loved it! Wanted to watch it again the next day!
5,Goonies Never Say Die!,"ain't that the truth! A true Goonie will never quit! that's what this movie taught me at a young age, if you believe with perseverance you can over come ANYTHING that life throws at you, this is a childhood staple, I pity the fool who's never seen the Goonies! story line is fantastic, the child actors, so much goodness, there's not enough room to go through it all!HHHEEEEEEYY YOUUU GUUUUUUUYYYSSSSS!"
3,Goonies is an entertaining if somewhat juvenile film,"I remember having watched this movie quite fondly as a kid. However on a second viewing with my son, the movie does not hold up to time very well."
5,"The best ""kids"" movie of the 80s (or ever?)","The Goonies is the adventure that all of us dreamed of having as kids. A rainy Friday afternoon transforms into an almost-believable underground romp with a group of kids that you could imagine yourself hanging out with back in middle school. Imagine that, a movie with an all-child cast that's actually likeable and who actually talk/behave like children! Screenwriters & directors today can learn a lot from Chris Columbus & Richard Donner.The great locations/sets and dialogue between the goonies never gets old and I make it a point to rewatch this at least once a year."
5,A classic,"I, like many people, grew up with the Goonies as a favorite. I know almost all the line by heart and I never get tired of this great film. It was never designed to be a high quality epic, so if you are a Lucas fanboy, maybe some of the best parts will go right over your head.A great movie for kids as the humor is dorky kid stuff and nothing vulgar or really offensive, my 6 year old has been watching this for years.A movie about ordinary kids, the rejects i fact, who stumble on the adventure of a lifetime! Enjoy! Its free if you stream it on Prime, so add it to the watchlist and turn it on when you have nothing else to do."
5,Simply Awesome,"Simply Awesome , This movie made me a movie geek when I was 8. Foundation set for loving Pirates, Hobbits, and all manner of freeks and geeks."
3,A must-have if you've got kids.,I saw this when my 30-year-old was a kid and will enjoy watching it with my nieces and nephews! Hidden treasure and best buddies..who could want more?
1,Disappointed!,"I love this movie which is why I ordered it. Unfortunately the movie would not play all the way through. It kept fast forwarding itself, and jumping scenes as if it were scratched. I took the movie out, it had no visible scratches on it at all. I put it back in and it did the same thing at the same scenes through out the movie. I purchased a bunch of movies from Amazon for Xmas, I hope this is an isolated incident. I will definitely be returning for a refund."
5,This movie is good enuff,one of my favorite movie of all time. i wish i was part of the movie. when i found it finally i grabbed it as fast as i can.
3,Great for kids,I bought this for my youngest son who is now into pirates. He loved it. I remember it from the 80's and enjoyed seeing it again.
5,A Five- Star MUST!!,"I have, will and currently LOVE the Goonies-- I probably will for my whole life. I first saw this when I was 5 (hey, I heard plenty of bad language my whole childhood through, and it didn't turn me into a depraved, immoral individual), and while I can understand a lot of parent's concerns about their children seening a movie with ""bad words,"" please don't overlook this movie for that purpose (c'mon, your kids have heard it, probably from your own mouth while driving). The cast is enigmatic, has wonderful chemistry and the imagination used to make this movie inspires TO THIS DAY. Although I dissent from the review that says that the magic is the friendship, I think the magic in this movie was definitely imagination. Mikey's imagination and his belief in his imagination and support form his friends saved the neighborhood.Besides, there are too many giggle-worthy moments in this movie. I could sit here, give a recap and list them, but that would be beside the point."
4,Great gift for Goonies fan,"This was a great product. I doubt my husband (he is 35) will ever play the game, but he just loves this movie and said it was one of his best gifts. (And I get him really nice gifts). It also comes with extras that any Goonies fan will appreciate."
5,Good Adventure Movie,"Don't know why I'd never seen this movie before, but just recently purchased it, my wife & I watched it, and both of us were highly entertained. Took a little bit to get the adventure started but once it did it was a roller coaster ride all the way to the finish. Funny seeing some of the current day actors as children. Definitely worth what I paid for it. Good movie! -kd5-"
5,Great Movie!!,"The Goonies has always been one of my favorite movies from my childhood. I always try to catch it when it plays on TV, but they always shred the movie beyond recognition. Finding a quality DVD for the movie hasn't been easy either. When I found the this version of The Goonies, I was stoked! I couldn't wait to get it into my hands. I put the DVD in the Blu-Ray player and fell in love with the movie all over again. I've watched the butchered TV version so many times, I forgot some of of the best parts!Since it is a Blu-Ray disc the quality of the picture is amazing. The bonus features are good too. All in all, I think this is a must have for you collection if you are a fan. Two thumbs up!(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,DUSTY'S REVIEW,"This movie rock's. It's my favorite movie. I remember watching it as a kid and still love it, ive watched it atleast fifty times and i'll never get bored of it. I had it on tape it it's much better on dvd plus you get alot of extra features."
5,Old School,"The movie that started it all. This movie is more than a classic, it defining moment in cinema. This adventure filled movie, is excellent and needs to be owned."
4,"Blu ray transfer good, have reasonable expectations","Given: this movie is already great. Review is on the single disk blu ray quality only.Pros: Very decent HD picture. Some scenes pretty grainy, some scenes super crisp in Blu, good for an old film.Cons: Some digital artifacts through out that the average joe might not ever notice, making me wonder if the film masters were really rescanned to achieve the purest HD and just over compressed in the single disc version... it does not appear to be an upconversion of the old dvd source materials like the first release of the Stargate Blu-Ray that was panned. On the other hand, film grain is natural in filmography, or on purpose like in the apollo 13 blu disc to achieve the vintage look. It also appears on various scenes that some of the optics in the filmography was a bit odd, being focused in the center but distorted at a certain radius.No brainer for $10. Enjoy."
4,Goonies Never Say Die,I've loved this movie ever since I was a young boy. Filled with the adventure most young kids daydream about.
5,The Goonies,"This movie is the greatest.Our son loved it as a child and now his children are hooked.Actually,after we receive our copy,there will be three copies in the family.One here,at Grannies home,they have a copy at their Dad's and they asked Santa to bring a copy for when they are at their Mother's home.I don't think this movie will ever loose it's popularity.Another great one is,Eight Below.It's based on a true story.Probably not suitable for little ones.One scene about the leopard seal is scary.Even when you know it's coming next,the music and the scene will grab your attention.Fast forward the scene.Our Grandchildren have been watching it since they turned six.They really like this one,too."
3,? PG,"Not PG. Strong language, albeit in Spanish subtitles, with content innapropriate for children: MArijuana, Cocaine, Heroine, sexual .........' '***T'.Might consider this for the younger kids."
5,"Goonies, and other movies and games","I liked this movie when my kids were small, and now I can share this movie with my grandchildren. Amazon has the best customer service that I have ever encountered. I have told so many people how quick my orders arrive, and how easy it is to order gifts. I have severe arthritis that limits how long I can walk let alone stand in lines. I now have no excuse not to shop when I can do it from my computer. My grandchildren are going to be so excited with the gifts they are receiving this year.Thank you so much for great choices and quick shipping as well as the customer service representatives that I have spoken to when I ordered incorrectly. Both online and telephone made the refund exchange so easy.Thank you,Jean Cyford"
5,goonies,what can you say about a classic. was time to show the kids the type of movie I grew up with
5,Great movie,This always takes me back to my childhood. I love this movie! Great kids adventure film. It has been fun watching it now with my four year old.
4,Classic Movie,"This has been a favorite of mine since I was a little girl. I recently bought it for a girls night at my house and showed to a few of my coworkers that had never seen it and they both enjoyed it very much. It has a few curse words, I would not recommend for very small children."
3,Very Good! Extremely Underrated!,"When I was a kid this movie was all the rave. I saw it with two of my friends and loved it so much that I made my two younger brothers watch it. It's about a tightly-knit group of friends who are trying to find a way to spend their last weekend together. Because of a greedy company their neighborhood is about to be turned into a golf course. While exploring the attic they find an authentic 17th century treasure map, deciding to find the gold and save the neighborhood they set out to a sumtarrenan cavern full of booby-traps and skelatons. You've got to see this film, there are a few jokes not meant for younger kids like the breaking of a certain part on the famous statue David and one character Mouth mis-translating packing instructions to a Spanish housekeeper. Very Funny! Rent it!"
3,"Blu-ray quality is good, not great","This is a wonderful movie, but the newly released blu-ray version doesn't do it justice. Surely they could have done a better transfer than this. It is extremely grainy in parts, almost like VHS (no I'm not kidding). Blade Runner, which was filmed a couple years before The Goonies, looks much better on blu-ray as does Back to the Future (which was filmed a couple years after). I really don't understand why such a widely loved classic movie got such a so-so treatment when transferred to blu-ray. Bummer. [This is for the new 25th anniversary set]"
3,Good movie.,"Good movie to watch, except the screaming kids voices were too much. Other than that, it is a good movie to watch."
4,Inafaltable en una coleccion,"Excelente pelicula, es de las que yo catalogo como infaltable en cualquier coleccion. Una de mis peliculas favoritas de mi infancia. En cuanto a este DVD, pues nada, excelente calidad, Audio en ingles con sus respectivos subtitulos en español. Lamentablemente las caracteristicas especiales del mismo no tienen ningun tipo de traduccion, solo audio en ingles. Sinceramente nunca jamas entendere como es posible que a estas productoras les cueste tanto trabajo colocarle un simple subtitulo a todas las caracteristicas de un disco, sabiendo que esto no le resta absolutamente nada a la calidad del producto en vista a que un subtitulo solo pesa unos cuantos kb. Cuando sera que se daran cuenta que en los estados unidos hay un mercado gigantesco a ser explotado de habla hispana. Nunca lo entendere."
5,a classic,this movie is by far my favorite movie of all time. i first saw it when i was about 9 years old and begged my mom to buy it for me. i am now 17 and i can honestly say i have watched the goonies at least 15 times in the past 2 weeks. i just keep on rewinding and watching it over and over. there isn't a scene in the movie i get bored with. this is a great movie for any person young or old. there isn't a doubt in my mind that it will always be my favorite.
5,Goonies forever,"There are very few films that really stick with you from childhood on until today. See when I was a kid and I first saw Goonies it was like a little adventure you were preparing for. You had your blanket it was dark you had your friends over watching the film made you yourself go on an adventure. Why anyone would give this film anything below a 4 star rating is beyond me.I dont have to tell you the story line of this film because chances are you saw it already if not then you must be somewhere under 27 or 28 because this film was really for the late 20 early 30's individual before surround sound, and HD was even considered as a movie format. The benefit of Goonies is that it takes you back to when you were a kid and keeps you there."
4,Has everything about Goonies inside!!,"Comes with an unique board game, a 1985 souvenir magazine reprint with cast photos of Chunk, Data the Fratelli's . The only thing was not amazing was the blu ray case an disc, they don't match with the other cool stuff."
2,OK,"Not exactly High Cinema. A movie for some but not for others. Mostly a kid's film, but some adults like it too"
1,waste of money,contrast was way way too dark-impossible to correct with video settings changes. to check i borrowed a dvd and compared. shoulda bought dvd. download is crap. vjm
1,Drivel.,"If you want to be subjected to nearly 2 hours of pre-pubescent boys yelling continuously at each other in squeaky voices, then go ahead, maybe the other content of the movie will entertain.For me, I'm posting this review to offset a bit the unimaginable 4 1/2 star overall rating this movie has, that enticed me to waste 30 minutes of my life in the belief that there had to be a scene somewhere beyond the opening that did not consist of kids yelling at each other."
5,Goonies: Always a great choice.,"What else is there to say. Goonies is an all time great family action adventure. If you are debating whether or not to make the purchase, debate no longer. You can't go wrong. My advice is to always purchase new."
5,Why isn't this on DVD?,"A classic for children of the 80's. Nerve-wracking, compassionate, and adventurous."
2,skipped several times,"What a disappointment for this old movie to skip several times throughout the movie. I would return it, but it's a pain to go through that process..."
2,Goonies - a parent review - not for kids,"This is a parent review of ""The Goonies."" It is not a good movie for kids, as it containsquite a few instances of the s-word. It is rated PG, but that rating from the mid-1980sdoesn't compare to PG movies these days. In 2005, this movie would be rated PG-13,with clarifications about the language, among other elements where parental guidance would be suggested. I remember the movie fondly when I saw it myself in the theaterwhen I was 27 years old. But I would not want to hear kids (meaning those in the basicgrade-school age) talking with this kind of language."
2,Not as good as I remembered,"I had great memories of this as a kid. As an adult, I was very disappointed in the awful language in this movie. I don't want my kids watching this. Also, one of the brothers taunts the other by calling him ""adopted"" (which he isn't). It's just meant as an insult, which is a really terrible thing to be showing to children. Adoption is a wonderful gift & blessing - and I definitely don't want my children seeing that kind of garbage (especially since we are adopting!!!!). I got rid of the DVD after watching it once."
1,$40 for a movie we have seen on TV 50times a year?,You have got to be kidding me... this bluray is not even a step up from the DVD in any major way. And gouging huge fans who cant wait till the price drops to $10 like all blurays will? Disgusting...
1,Goonies,"I have seen this movie a million times and just love it. I was very excited to share it with my son but when it arrived, the words and when they say them are all out of sync. Very distracting to watch. It does this the entire movie. This will be the last movie purchase from Amazon."
5,You have to love the Goonies...,"I have loved this movie for years but I always wondered what happened to the octopus scene that they refer to at the end of the movie. On this DVD, they have included several deleted scenes and one of them is the octopus scene. I know now why they choose to delete it from the original movie. :) The rest of the deleted scenes are great and I can only imagine they were deleted due to time constraints. This is a great movie and I highly recommend it!"
4,The Goonies,"The best movie to watch is, The Goonies, and I have three reasons to back this up. First, the story itself helps you believe that anything can happen. Like you meeting a crew of dead pirates while your being chased by crooks at the same time. Mext, the story is a mix vetween the Hardy Boys and Treasure Island, but funny at teh same time. Third the characters are all unique because at teh same time they can be funny and serious. This movie has the best twist to it. So if you're ever thinking about treasure watch The Goonies because of the story, characters, and the great twist. Oh, and lets's not forget the treasure."
4,Great Family Movie,"I think this movie was a great family movie and not just for kids. I have seen this movie several times and now my kids love it as well. I just wish we can find the Soundtrack or at least the Single from Cyndi Lauper with the song ""Goonies 'R' Good Enough (for me)"". We can't find it anywhere!"
5,the best ever,even though i wasnt alive in 1985 i saw the movie and i am 10 years old and i go crazy for the goonies i like the chinnese kid the best i forgot his name but he is full of suprises and i like his inventions i dont like leaders in most movies they get all the credit but micky is a ok guy i like him and chunky he issecond place he is funny and fat that really mixes the 80s rock
4,It's the goonies... on Blu-ray.,"You've seen this movie. It's the same movie, it's just on Blu-ray. What else is there to say? Great picture, great sound, same Goonies."
5,Super AWESOME movie,"My daughter LOVED this movie.it is her all-time favorite movie.my weenie of a son did not like it...mostly because of one character...Sloth.although,there are quite a few cuss words and an inappropriate scene.it's probably a good idea to watch the movie before you let your kids watch it,or at least look up the list of cuss words online and see if it's OK.I personally LOVE the movie.don't listen to all the stupid 1-4 reviews"
4,Happy,I ordeded the item on 2/2 and recieved it 2/7. i was very happy and it turned into a great birthday for my husband
5,are good enough,"Everyone who saw this in the 80s loves this movie. I frankly caught it on cable, but was already a preteen I think, so not quite under its spell. However, it is sophisticated swashbuckling entertainment and just so integrated into the first half of the 80s that I think everyone in their teens even saw it on HBO. It has talentless teen stars like one of the 'Coreys', has Cyndi Lauper music and Capt. Lou., and a classic Donner/Spielberg feel like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Close Encounters.Trully a classic defining that era that is overlooked vs ""the breakfast club"" and others, because it aimed at a younger audience."
4,Put soap in the mouth!!!,"I enjoyed the basic story ,but some of the language is really Bad!!! I would recomend that you let your parents see it first.Anyway, the main idea is that these kids find an old treasure map, they decide to follow it to were One-Eyed Willy's treasure. They run into outrageous booby-traps and to top it all off, they are being chased by danagerous criminals!Before I stop writing, I want to say two things, 1. Beware of the language. 2. I would recomened this movie."
4,Goonies great!,"About 10 years ago, i saw The Goonies for the first time. I was in awe at the complex characters and their personalities, and especially at the concept of the pirate ship filled with gold and jewels beneath an italian resturant. I liked the chinese kid, I cant remember his name right now, and his kool gadgets. I was kinda freaked out by that monster that is chained up under the italian resturant though, he was kinda scary at first, but then i kinda warmed up to him cause i saw he was nice. Although it may seem farfetched to someone else, i overall think the Goonies is a great movie and a little getaway everytime i find the time to sit down and relive my childhood."
4,this is such an adorable movie,Ok I admit It. Im 13 and I just saw this movie for the first time a month ago lol! I really didn't think I was going to like it. But I told myself It was made in the 80s it cant be that perfect right? But it had everything a great movie should have drama comedy suspense. The goonies movie Is awesome!
4,i love this movie,I absolutely LOVED this movie as a kid. i ordered it for my sister for Christmas. it arrived on time and in perfect condition
5,Classic,"Watched it with my 8 yr old who absolutely loved it. Its funny, is filled with adventure and a bit of fantasy."
3,Are you still a Goonie?,"This was a blast from the past. I remember seeing this when I grew up and when i found it at a bargain price on Amazon I thought this would be fun for me and my kids to watch. While my 5 yr old son was a little freaked out by Chuck almost getting his hand placed in a blender and the Sloth character, my oldest enjoyed the movie just fine. A good adventure movie with a nice message or never stop trying. I would recommend the movie for nostalgic purposes, however the Cyndi Lauper video in the bonus features I could do without."
5,Classic movie,"Great movie, brought back memories of being a kid and going on adventures with my cousins in my grandparents attic and basement, looking for 'treasure'."
5,BEST EVER!,"I have loved The Goonies since I was 4 years old. It is the best movie, I must have seen about 50 times since I was four. It is so hilarious and always puts a smile on my face whenever I watch it. The actors are great, especially Chunk. He is my favorite. This movie is best ever."
5,If you want adventure this is the one!,"Goonies is the best movie, I've liked it scice I was 5 years old! My mom says I shouldn't watch it anymore, but I still do!"
4,pleasant classic picture,I enjoy very much this picture with young artist. they are funny. i like the Steven Spielberg touch. very relaxing picture
4,Your A Goonie!!!!!,"The Goonies.....A great movie of delightfull fun. Kids, a lost treasure, pirates, traps, villians, and a barrel full of laughs.This movie has delighted my nephew so much that i'm giving him his own copy. This movie has kept the kids quite and occupied quite a bit....which isn't nessacarilly a bad thing, and i like it myself as well. Get the gonnies and enjoy....especially get the gonnies if you have kids 10 and under."
5,The Greatest 80s movie!,"This is a terrific family 80s movie. It is about a group of kids who will soon be moving due to financial circumstances. They find a treasure map and go off to search for One-Eyed Willy's treasure. Along the way they run into escaped prisoners, befriend Sloth, and outwit Willy's booby traps. Classic film!"
4,Turn off your brain -- this is still a cute movie,"This was not as bad as you remember ... it's a Who's Who of popular movies.Kerri Green is still cute, Corey Feldman and Martha Plimpton are still irritating, Sean Astin is not yet a hobbit, and the ""Tooz"" never looked so good! First movie for Josh Brolin. The amazing Anne Ramsey and the Fratelli's are a stitch.Yeah, the plot is weak. The kids overact. The timing is not great. So turn off your brain and have some sophomoric fun!"
5,Come on it is Goonies,Just one of those movies I grew up with. I bought to have my kids watch it. Now we all love it.Shane
5,Came on time with great quality!,"First off, Goonies is such a classic that I was excited to buy it for my step brother for Christmas. The delivery was very fast and the quality of the DVD and the case were excellent. Great movie, great experience!"
5,BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD!!! AHHhh... MEMORIES..,"Every generation has certain movies that will always transport them back to childhood. ""The Goonies"" does that for alot of people in my generation. The cool thing about this flick is, not only does it take you back, but, once there, it captures so wonderfully what the best moments of being a kid felt like. Yes, the plot is mostly a fantasy-the ultimate wish fulfillment of having a great adventure, and saving the day. However, the soul of the movie-why it's still cherished today-is it's understanding of friendship and family. ""Stand By Me"" is the only other film that has so accurate a portrait of adolescent boys interacting with each other. The cast had such an amazing chemistry. Great direction by Richard Donner, and this is Spielberg magic in it's prime. This fantastic DVD presentation does the film justice. Some may think this movie is way too 80's, but to me ""The Goonies"" is an essential classic."
3,It was aiight!!!!,"i loved this movie as a kid back in the 80's and i still love it. i bought the video for my brother and he loves it. we've watched it hundreds of times and now that i've seen it a lot as a grown up, i've found there to be many mistakes in the movie. i guess it was bad directing or editing. but overall it's good for kids."
5,goonie perfect,This movie is awsome it is hilariuos when i saw it i rememberd awhile back along time ago i had it but i traded it for jumanji i mist it so much i couldn't stand it and i could not find it but i found it two years later i was so happy i watched it so much pice out.
5,What's a good name for this review?,"Oh hell yeah! Indiana Jones meets The Sandlot I'd say. Like most 80s' movies ""The Goonies"" dose not suck. If tou haven't seen this movie rent it right now! In fact wal you're there pick up ""Back to the Future"", ""Bill and Ted's Exellent Adventure"", ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"", ""Gremlins"", ""Gremlins II:The New Batch""(I said ""BATCH"" not bitch), and of course ""Big"".And If you don't like it, I will find you."
4,Fun,"What a just plain fun movie! A fun tale of being a kid and having dreams and believing in stories before we all get to the point of having to fully face reality. A little bit Indiana Jones, a little bit fairy tale, a little bit mystery and a little bit teen/pre-teen romance. Just a fun way to remember a time when life was simpler and much more fun!"
5,HEY YOU GUYS!!!,This is a wonderful BluRay experience! The extra features are so cool! The board game and the magazine included is a must for any fan of the movie!! DO NOT listen to any of the bad reviews from people who do not know how to buy the correct region!!! This BluRay plays great on my player and it will on yours too! Just make sure you buy the correct version!!
4,Corny in a cute sort of way,"I don't think I've ever seen a movie so corny yet so cute at the same time. Despite the 1980s special effects and acting, there's a certain charm toThe Goonies. It's largely from the energy of the kids - led byThe Lord Of The Rings's Sean Astin. The kids are loud - sometimes too loud - but they're also adorable. The movie follows them along on their quest for lost treasure - and maturity. This is a great adventure movie for kids (although Sloth might be a bit scary)."
5,Box set is a must for Goonies fans,"All I want to say is if your a true fan of this movie, get this box set. Not only do you get a stunning quality movie, but you get all kind of extras, including a board game...thats amazing!!!"
5,Goonies R Good Enough,"Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.....Cindy lauper........Man, this is a timeless classic, I first saw it on t.v when I was really little, and I still watch it today (on dvd). Worth the watch to see Chunk spill his food on himself and say ""aww sh*t!"""
1,PG?,"I remembered seeing this as a kid and enjoying it. I thought it would be a great movie to let my kids watch, and went based on it being PG, not even PG-13. We didn't even get 15 min into the movie and the amount of ""OMG"" and ""S***"" had us turning it off. Too bad that ""PG"" doesn't necessarily mean appropriate for kids. Guess my memory blocked out the questionable stuff."
1,Childish potty humor.,"If you enjoy potty humor an eleven year old boy would find funny, then this would fit the bill. The initial car chase was fun, but that was about it. It is extremely seldom that I do not finish a movie (this is perhaps the fifth one in my whole life), however, I was only able to endure it for about 30 minutes. If I were Spielberg, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated in any way with this."
3,Believe Me When I Say I Saw This Movie Twice!,"That's because it was so good the first time I saw it. And I had many questions about this movie and what happened. First, I read some other reviewers reviews of this movie and they don't explain something. What happend to that guys face? It made me sad that the mean lady was mean to him on the boat just because his face is different than hers. She is an ugly, mean lady.My favorite parts are about the camera belt and the oily shoes that squirt oil on the log. How come I wish i had some of those so I could use them on my little sister when she is anoying me.One question I still have is I wonder if they will ever fix his face with the money from the buried treasures? I watched it again to see if they did because I couldn't remember. THey saved the town."
2,not that into it,"My husband watched this movie when he was a kid. He enjoys watching it till this day. He introduce me to this movie. I watch it with him, but I really don't care for it. It is interesting in the beginning. Some parts of the middle of the movie is ok. But when they get to the ship I think it get's boring."
3,Mediocre,"This is mediocre, at best. Watchable, yes, with children, but just barely. The plot is very predictable. The ending is weak. The effects are marginal (some are downright bad). The editing is not very good, either. If it weren't a serious attempt, it almost could be a classic late night show (which is not always a good thing). Pass this one by."
2,Movie is ok. Movie is NOT close to great,"There are many better family movies. ""Camera Angles"" and attire are done on purpose i think. Story line very very predictable."
2,Goonies are not good for this family,"My husband and I watched the Goonies for the first time with our eight year old son the other night. I would in no way call this a family film. I know children will hear foul language from time to time but this show seemed to open with pointlessly foul and ugly humor; the kind I don't enjoy hearing from a child. The references to sex toys and drugs serve no real family entertainment purposes. While I found the adventure to be appealing, I could have done without the low class, tasteless humor of the spanish interpreter."
4,the goonies,it was a very good movie the first time i seen it 20 some years ago and it still makes me laugh even now. so it has to be a very good flick for me to spend the money to buy it.
4,Great Family Fun,I first saw this on Beta in the 80s. It was great then. It is clean and fun to watch. Even today I still enjoy it.Love the Pirate Ship and the whole story is a great childhood adventure.
2,Great adventure tarnished with filthy language,"I remembered this moving growing up, and couldn't wait to buy it for my children. I was shocked to see all the cuss words they had thrown in this movie. Why do movie writers feel the need to put these words in? They add nothing to the story. Yet another great adventure movie that is tarnished..."
2,This DVD COULD be ALOT better........,"The Goonies is such an excellent movie and all but the DVD was a disappointment. The picture and sound is fantastic but it's just that not all the deleted scenes are here. There are only 4 deleted scenes and they are the Stop'N Snack, the Data binocular part, the octopus, and the scene where Chunk and Sloth come to the cave with spikes. We are still missing the Steph and Mouth plank scene, the leech/oath scene, the scene where Mikey and Mouth save Data as he slips on the log, and the scene where Data blows up. The second disappointing this is that the deleted scenes that are on the DVD aren't even in the movie. They are sperate which is bad cause when you view them it starts off just from there so it's hard to know what part of the movie they originally were in."
3,product came from canada,Movie came from Canada so everything also written in French. Movie played in English. Took forever for it to get here.
5,Adventure,"Every adult that I have talked to loves this movie for the simple fact that it reminds all of us what it was being a kid. Exploring with your friends on those Saturday mornings and discovering all sorts of treasures. I love watching this movie on rainy days with my children. I have lost track of the number of times I have seen it. I am so glad that it is coming out on DVD. Without question, this is a MUST have for anyones collection."
5,one of the best all time movies,"The first time I saw this my friend practically had to pin me down and force me to. I thought I was too old for kiddy films anymore, but after seeing this, I'm rethinking that thought! The Goonies is a hilarious, cute, and attention-grabbing movie. The plot is an age old story: a few hardy boy type kids on a treasure hunt. Incorporated into the film is a little bit of romance, a little bit of terror, and a whole lot of adventure! After seeing this film i wanted to be a goony too and go on adventures with Mikey, Mouth, Data, Chunk, Brand, Andy, and Stef. Give this movie a chance, you won't regret it."
3,Blu Ray version made me blue,"I love this movie, it is probably my #1 favorite of all time. I bought the UK version because the USA hasn't released it yet. I am disappointed with the quality. It is not blue ray quality at all. This becomes very noticeable in the dark scenes and it gets very grainy. Looks like it was just transfered to blu ray disc but not digitally enhanced or cleaned up.My regular DVD played thru my up converting player looks better than the blu ray unfortunately.Hopefully the USA release will have a remastered version that will be true HD quality."
3,basic introduction. just the basics.,"nice book for a reading introduction about this topic. But clearly not helpful for conducting any serious work in this field.For engineers, buying is maybe not a ""must"" since this is clearly not a reference book.Maybe borrow it..."
1,Not Worth the Price,"Be wary of this release! Ostensibly a special, it is a poorly strung together compendium of movie trailers! Additionally, the special Featurette section stops each video mid sentence at the 4 minute mark (on 10 minute shorts!). Definitely a slapped together, low budget DVD meant to trick buyers."
2,"quality musicals, lack luster DVD","This DVD lets you in on lots of behind-the-scenes info about our favorite musicals from the 60s, but the quality of the DVD leaves something to be desired. I bought this elsewhere online, new, and some of the segments were suddenly cut short (in mid-sentence, even). So buyer beware."
2,Not what it seems to be,I bought this thinking these were the full length movies. It's not. It's just a review of great movies from the 60s. Not all that great.
3,Bought for a School Assignment,I bought this book strictly for information for a paper for my one of my classes last semester. While I think it was kind of dry it did have all the information that I was looking for.
2,Would Make a Different Selection,"I had to read this book for a school assignment. It was very tedious to get through, highlighting the intricacies of the Nightingales' land ownership and family relations. While all of this information was pivotal to the plot, it made the book stagnant and there were many instances that I found myself thumbing through the information for the next instance of plot progression. I should have selected a different book for my reading assignment. I barely finished it in time for my project."
2,Eh...,"There certainly is plenty of information in this book; unfortunately much of it gets repeated over and over. There is a dry-as-dust mantle that accompanies nearly ever chapter, and the narrative can be confusing as it skips back and forth between years or even decades. I am still reading it, but I can't say I'm enjoying it much."
4,People Magazine for 19th-Century Buffs,"I enjoyed this book a lot! If you're into the 19th century, the Nightingales are so well-connected that this book reads like a who's who. In the family tree, you can even figure out how Helena Bonham Carter is related to Florence Nightingale! Gill paints a lively, sympathetic picture of the often dysfunctional family. Loved her pacing and touches of humor. Is it worse to be a living legend or the sister/father/mother/cousin/niece of a living legend? The scenes in the Crimea are not for the faint of heart or stomach. Meaning, I loved them."
4,A Family Like No Other,"Engrossing, enthralling, a finely limned psychological portrait of a family as well as of Nightingale herself, a matchless look at the murky motives that governed women's conduct in the Victorian era. The bulk of the book builds up to and ends with the Crimean War. But Nightingale lived on for many decades after that pivotal event. This is a pattern I have seen with many biographies of famous women: apparently nothing much of interest happens after they turn 50 or so ..."
3,HAWK-POP 3 1/2 Stars,"Just fine for a latter-day ( 12 years old ) HAWKWIND album. If you've heard and enjoyed 'The Ballad of the Black Blade' or some of the 'Chronicals' tour material then you will like this. This largely instrumental disk starts with the ""poppish"" 'The War I Survived' and drifts between mellow synth-rock and material with a soft, synthesized, BLUE OYSTER CULT feel. The remaining tracks on the disk are: 'Wastelands of Sleep', 'Neon Skyline', 'Lost Chronicles', 'Tides', 'Heads'( a bit PINK FLOYDish ), 'Mutation Zone', 'E.M.C.', 'Sword of the East', and 'Good Evening'. Running time: 44 minutes, 14 seconds."
1,The Price Is Too High,"Normally, I would have ordered this DVD title, since I have all of the other sets in the LAW & ORDER franchise.But, all of a sudden, the price for a set has gone up approximately $12.00.Gee, and in this economy.I'll pass. Maybe in a few months, Amazon and Universal will come to their senses and go back to the old price.If not, I'll just watch my 10 seasons of LAW & ORDER:SVU all over again.Dumb move, guys!"
1,Review of ludicrous price!,I loved watching the season on television and was very much looking forward to the DVD so I could spare myself the commercials. The show itself is awesome! Normally I wouldn't post a review because of an outrageously high price but... this is absurd! Whoever set this price is delusional! Add me to the list of people who won't be buying this season also. As another reviewer pointed out... and in this economy too! Insane!
1,stratched DVD,DVD shipped fast...but DVD were stratched causing them to skip and not properly play. luckly was able to return them to local store and get a working copy. def disappointed new product came in less than ideal condition
5,Essential for An SVU-aholic!,"As a longtime fan of the Law and Order: SVU series, I own every season of the DVDs and watch them often. I love the show very much and like that the case that holds the DVDs is slim and takes up less space on the shelf, unlike the first few season's packaging. I also like that on the DVD episode selection, it gives you a brief synopsis of the episode and the DVDs also project in high quality. I will definitely be buying Season 12 when it comes out."
4,Christmas Gift,"This was purchased as a Christmas gift. It came in a timely fashion and made my sister happy, so I am pleased."
4,Unstable,"I loved this episode.I will admit I watched it for Wentworth Miller but was unsure of how I would feel about his character...Nate Kendall is one character I would love to see again,not just because of Miller but because as characters go he was alarmingly wonderful.The alarming part comes from the cold indifference he shows to everyone in the episode, the rape victim he doesn't want to deal with because 'victims cling', and just about every inappropriate thing that comes out of his mouth afterwards. The character was just so damn intriguing I want to see more of him. I hope his character comes back."
5,Can't put a price tag on captivating television,"I started watching Season 1 last summer, and I am nearly caught up. The show has grown and changed in so many wonderful ways. Who cares if its more expensive? Everything that is great about SVU is still here...after 11 seasons."
5,outstanding as law & order suv always is,Law & order suv I feel is an outstanding show. With a great cast. I enjoy every episode. and having them on dvd I can watch them over and over again for many years to come.
5,COLLECT THEM ALL,"THIS IS THE BEST SHOW ON TV. GOOD STORIES. GREAT CHARACTERS.MAKES A GREAT COLLECTION. I NOW HAVE THEM ALL,"
1,Amazon 'download' rip off,"Price was right, IF we actually got something. . .The download link never worked, and we got absolutely NO RESPONSE from Amazon customer service to our complaints. They did, however, extract their buck from the credit card, and never even offered a refund."
4,Better than I expected,"This product is nowhere close to the real pinball game, but has many features of the real game. It can be played by one player or two players and there is an electronic scoreboard also. Sound effects are quite good, but not close to the real game in an arcade.Yes, it comes with very short legs and is intended to be used on a table top.Packaging was good and overall product quality seems good so far (it just arrived last week).Please note that it uses 4 'C' size batteries (not included) costing about $5 in local stores.Our children really enjoy playing with it (and they have played with Windows pinball game and are used to all the dazzle)."
3,Fun Game but Not Delivered as Shown,I was very disappointed that the game is misrepresented in the picture that portrays it. It shows the pinball game on full legs that would reach a child's waist. That is NOT the way it is made. It has small sqat legs and I had to expain to my child why it was not the same as the picture that it was advertised in.
5,Best WW2 War Movie,"No Doubt, this is the best WW2 war movie. Good story, Funny and Combat all in one package. And yes, i bought the DvD and it's a Collector item.I must have seen the DvD a dozen times already and I still enjoy it. If the sounds were more like in that movie "" Saving Private Ryan "" then you got one heck of a movie.I wish they edited the sounds and made them more realistic. It's also on Wide Format so you get to see everything it was intended to. I definitely recommend this Movie. I gave it 5 Stars. You won't be disappointed."
4,Note on Tiger tanks,"Enjoyable flick, especially the attention to detail. But German panzer crews had pink pipping on their black uniforms, I believe. As for the Tiger tanks in the square, the attention to detail is quite good, but in one scene in a profile shot of a Tiger as it moves you can see that the wheels supporting the tracks are single spaced. Tigers had overlapping wheels, plus it certainly looks like a Russian T-34 rolling chassis, but I don't mean to quibble as I was very impressed to see Tigers, but knew there had to be catch."
1,Kelly's Heroes,"The product cannot be played on my DVD-player because of ""area-limitations"".Subtitles only from England and France - I'm living in Denmark as a danish citizen and my language is danish.It was a wrong product in this case.Knud Veitland"
5,The Best Ever,"Just to say I love this movie, I watch atleast once a day. Donald Sutherland and Telly Savalas are at their best. Its funny, exciting, historically accurate, and will keep your attention throughout the whole movie. With a wonderful soundtrack including the likes of Hank Williams, Jr and the Mike Curb Congregtion you'll love this movie from beginning to end."
4,"World War II, 70's style","A classic Saturday afternoon ""guy's"" movie! Lots of big (and small name) stars when they weren't so big yet. Donald Sutherland's character obviously meant to appeal to the younger hippie moviegoer of the early 70's as well as the theme music. Not a serious WWII movie, but more of a comedy set during WWII with a some good action scenes."
5,A Funny anti establishment war flick,I really loved this film as it is not your traditional war film. The premise of having a bunch of renegade GI's rob a bank is a clever one. I am sure that it happened in one of our wars.
1,Total trash!,"When it comes to war dramatizations, I am a rewlist. ""Tora Tora Tora"", ""Stalingrad"", ""Band Of Brothers"", ""Untergang"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". This flop is nothing but another Hollywood, liberal contribution to the Second World War. Don Rickles, a well known stand up comic a soldier. Donald Sutherland, the hippie tank driver. Really? If true to life American soldiers didn't shave him bald the Germans would have done it. Carrol Oconnor made a convincing ""Archie Bunker"" however not a military officer. The only redeming actor of the whole lot is Clint Eastwood and he even appeared awkward playing his role. I don't own this movie, won't buy it. Take it from someone who watched it. The Three Stoogrs coikd have made a more realustic war movie. Save your money."
5,Kelly's Heroes DVD,The Kelly's Heroes DVD was received very promptly. I had seen the movie years ago and saw the tail end of it on TV and decided to buy it. It was received in just a few days and was in perfect condition.
5,"""Behind enemy lines? Yeah. That could be the perfect crime.""","This was the first Clint Eastwood movie I ever saw and I've yet to forget it. Picture this: You are an American soldier in WWII Europe. You have just found out about a bank in a town 30 miles away which happens to contain $16,000,000.00 worth of gold bars. You think, ""I could become a bank robber for about 3 days."" What's that you say? It's crazy? To think I could blow a bank and get away with it? What if that bank is in German territory? Well, I think you get the picture now."
5,Kelly's Heroes CD,THis product was a Christmas gift for my son in Nevada. He enjoyed watching it very much.I order many CD's from Amazon and have been pleased so far with the timley delivery and the condition of the items.
5,Kelley's Heroes is a incredibly funny World War 2 Movie,"I love all of the work of Clint Eastwood. This movie, which follows on the heels of his successful Sphagetti westerns, is a very interesting change of pace. The cast of this movie is superb. I love the roles of many including Donald Sutherland as ""Oddball""! This is a very funny movie!"
3,"Kelly""s Heroes","It's an ok movie good to while away some time when nothing is going on. Entertaining, fun without a lot of drama."
5,Wonderful Movie,"A great war time movie where things are a little loony but very Clint Eastwood, another blast from the past."
4,HIDDEN SHERMAN BLASTING TIGERS,"A lot of the hippie stuff in this movie is total nonsense & typifies the 1970's counter-culture era & crime caper genre. But there are terrific uniforms, equipment & combat scenes to be enjoyed. The Tiger tanks are amazingly convincing running mockups based on T-34 chasis. The film captures the dynamic movement & stalking of tanks in a French village. This is a comedy, action adventure so don't expect the real World War 2. The body count really piles up starting with the Sherman tank attack at the German rail yard. Enjoy the hilarious performances by a talented ensemble cast & treat this as an American wartime fantasy fairy tale."
5,Top Notch Movie,If you're looking for an off beat movie that very successfully combines totally different personalities (including Clint Eastwood in another top-notch performance of a totally interesting character) within a tense atmosphere (war) and still expect to see some quirky fun - then Kelly's Heroes is a must see!
4,"A funny, action-filled, WWII Western.","This movie is entertaining in so many ways: it's a comedy, an adventure, a war movie, a western... and it's got Clint! Sure, there's more meaningful films about war, but if you want to be entertained -- you can't go wrong with this one."
4,This film is absolutely worth seeing,"I was really shocked that film has been absolutely forgotten. It's definitely not a M*A*S*H (although it was made in the same year), but has really got its moments. Clint Eastwood, Telly Savalas, Donald Sutherland play together , which is unique. The story is about a private action during the WW2. It describes the army as a corrupt, meaningless thing but in a very funny way. Sutherland will definitely give you ""those positive rays"" END"
2,Waste of Money,"Exactly what kind of book was Dave aiming for? Certainly not any kind of real story, biography or interesting ride. This was just a form of therapy for him, that's on the reader's tab. Yes, it was only 'a year in the life' of Dave Navarro, but come on - this is all he could come up with? And though it has been mentioned that there are great snapshots - not one comes with any kind of caption that would have felt like the book was overall more connected. Save your money."
1,very boring,this is gotta be the most boring book i've ever read or tried to read (i got 3/4 of the way through it before i had to quit)i was suprised it sucked so bad because i really like neil strauss but i guess if all you have to write about is a washed up heroin addict that wont leave his house because he broke his glass unicorn then he did his best it surprises me that dave would want anyone to know how boring his life is hes suposed to be a rock star but he just sits in his house for a year (literaly)shooting heroin and feeling sorry for himself and writes a book about it if you want to read a good book by neil strauss check out a long hard road out of hell the book he did with manson but i would never recomend picking this one up you will be dissapointed
3,What A Pity Party,"Yes, you have/had a serious drug problem but did you really feel the need to document the entire book to this? The idea of having people over and making them enter the photo booth was kind of a neat idea - but that's about all I found interesting. Dave Navarro is a very bizarre individual. I wouldn't rush out to buy this book because there's nothing really informative or interesting in it. Get it at the library if you can and save yourself some money."
1,Boring and poorly written,I truly wanted to like this book but found it completely self-indulgent and just boring. Navarro tries so hard to come of as an intellectual and really just comes off as a loser with too much time on his hands. I had to force myself to finish it - I'm glad I bought it from bookcloseouts.
1,Boring,There are a lot of better rock autobiograhies out there at the moment. This one is very unfocused and you do not really get to understand what it really is about. The photos from his booth are interesting though but also do not make sense. A shame.
5,It's what Scar Tissue should have been,"SCAR TISSUE was the pity party, this book was just plain entertaining. I've been a fan of Dave Navarro's for quite some time (in interviews he was always so witty), so I was waiting for this book to get published. I think it has an awesome formula- a look into a year out of the life of a heroin addict/musician. We don't need their entire self-absorbed life story, documenting just a year was so much better. Though it does bring up Navarro's past a little bit to give you some insight as to who he is and the roads he has taken. Many things in this book made me laugh out loud, Dave has a f*cked up sense of humor! This book was very addicting and I read it in a day. Cheers to Neil Strauss for putting up with him!"
2,You have to be a dave navarro fan to enjoy this,This book is for the diehard Dave Navarro fans only. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the use of instamatic photos in the book is creative. The text is nothing more than diary entries by the guitarist. Neil Straus approached writing The Dirt with Motley Crue is a much more creative way which kept me interested. This book falls short unless I would have been inclined to want to see things Dave's way. I grew restless of this pretty quickly.
1,Extremely Uninteresting and Boring,"I was excited when I first read an excerpt from this book in Rolling Stone, only to have it come out a few years later (legal troubles prob). In the end, it is a bland and boring read about a self-absorbed loser whose life is really not interesting. There is no insight into anything, it is a stale narrative with nothing revealed."
1,"shock value, wrecking careers?","I read this book, actually started thumbing thru the text it was so raunchy. I thought women only gossiped. This weirdo tries to ruin other peoples careers by dishing their dirt like an Enquirer. What a disturbed blob. Let see, how can I ruin this person's entire life's work with a few paragraphs of my blabbering opinions trying to make myself feel not so disgusting and worthless? That is what it is all about, making yourself feel better at other peoples expense and trying to make a few bucks in the process."
5,Dave Navarro's Book,"I enjoyed this book, it gave interesting insight with Dave Navarro's life, feelings, and dark side of drug use. At the end of the book, a drug-free Dave relfects and makes comments about his dark times with drugs. Dave is definitely very intelligent."

4,I like Silicone,"I really do like the silicone bakeware that is out now and Silicone Zone's is as good as they get. My two cons are that the muffin pan is flimsy once full of muffin batter so you definately have to use a cookie sheet underneath to get them in and out of the oven, and two it is smaller than I expected, but in the end I've come to prefer the smaller muffins (this is not a mini muffin pan)for those with bigger appetites, just take two!"
5,No complaints yet,"This was our first venture into silicone, as our last beloved muffin pans finally got too rusty to justify keeping anymore. There was no smell from these that people report from some other silicone based products. They are easy to clean. I wouldn't call them nonstick. We still spray them, which is fine with us. Everything so far is so good. Hope this turns out to be a lasting product for us. If these continue to do well we will purchase more of them. Impressed with seller."
2,didn't work for me,I bought these muffin pans because I really wanted something non stick but when I baked my muffins they stuck really bad and I lost both pans' worth.
1,A Black Hole in the Memory,"The author obviously spent a lot of time finiding clever titles for her chapters! This is why I had to at least give the book a star... but boy, did she forget her story line! The downfall of this read is first and foremost the lack of consistency in facts, opinions, and arguments brought forward. I counted at least ten major contracdictions of facts and arguments in my first read alone. The book is not much in terms of disclosing interesting facts, but could make for a great comedy."
1,abusing the public school system,"This is the story of a teacher in a financially strapped school district who was well past retirement age and was offered a golden handshake to retire. She did not want to do so and as a result wasted huge amounts of taxpayer monies and working educators' time fighting through multiple appeals and an independent court process. She lost every time. Her revenge was to publish this book. Like most self-published books, it lacks objectiveness and any kind of editorial coherence. One quickly tires of her repetitive claims of innocence maligned. Before you buy it, ask yourself if you think teachers in the public school system are entitled to work past their seventies just because they want to and without regard to the financial realities of the school system."
4,Title Is Deceiving,This book is a good addition to any manager's library. It goes through the steps it takes to go through a web project. It is a good toolkit since it gives the reader a list of tools for many types of web testing.It also talks about Business Requirements and types of testing that can be done on web applications.As a novice tester the book may not answer all your questions but for testers who are looking for quick answers and want to reserach tools this is a must buy.The CD also offers several templates for the Test Process that I found useful.
2,Do not judge a book by it's cover,"Being new to test Automation and working in a Web environment, this sounded like the perfect book for me... ""Automated Web Testing Toolkit."" I was looking forward to its arrival and waited 2 months for it to become available. Finally, the book arrived and after a few hours of reading I realized that the book was not at all what the title promised. This is a book about the basic practices and methodologies of testing with an emphasis on Web testing. I was hoping for specific information on the methods, concepts and practices of test automation. If you have little experience in testing on the Web or otherwise, this book is great for you. If, however, you want to do what its' title suggests... automated web testing, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU!"
3,Pluses and minuses,"On the plus side this book gives some basic quality assurance techniques to the web development community. From what I've seen, experienced and endured, this is sorely needed. The book also is not centered on any particular vendor, which is something that I appreciate. On the negative side, the book is extremely lightweight, skimms the surface of some important issues (content management, security and performance testing come to mind.) Recommended for entry level testing professionals (or those who find themselves thrust into a testing role) and web developers who want to expand their professional horizons. NOT recommended for anyone who has been doing structured testing in any environment. This book will state the obvious and waste your time."
5,Perfectly sized,Took quite a bit of time to find the right set. This one has full size dominos and it is very lightweight. Total width of case is not even an inch and can tuck very easily in your suitcase. Also bought the Cribbage and More Travel Game Pack with it. The cribbage board can be stored open in the zip up bag. Liked it so much that we bought another set for friends.
5,Book Nitty-Gritty,"This review is for the ""substanially revised and expanded"" Continuum 2003 edition.A chunky trade paperback, 751 pp, 2.75 pounds. B&w; illustrations.Indexed. Over 100 pp of narrative and bibliographic end notes. 38 p Bibliography.Blurbs...""A superbly translated study of the legacy of the largely American postwar occupation of Japan....""""What is most impressive is that a Japanese author should have such a vivid understanding of the relations among the Americans, and particularly of General Douglas MacArthur's personality, along with a firm grasp of all the policy debates.""""This major contribution is accessible to the general reqader with little or no background in these important events.... Professor Takemae's indispensable contribution is most welcome.""""...a masterful assessment of the US occupation of Japan and the impact and legacy of occupation reforms.... This book is a must for all who are interested in US-Japan relations and postwar Japanese history."""
2,Too Many Bad Discs,"Been using these discs for a while, but this batch was terrible. Out of 50 discs, 11 were bad--kept getting ""Sense Code Error 52102"". I bought 200 of these and this was the first 50 out of the 200. Hopefully I won't experience the same amount of errors on the rest."
1,disc have a strong chemical smell,"I've always enjoyed using these disc, they record very well, however this time they had a very strong chemical smell. That's why I gave them a low star rating."
3,Normally a great product,"I have been a fan of Verbatim blank media for years. Normally, I would buy ""8X"" for compatibility with both new and older dvd recorders, and never get those useless ""coasters"". I purchased the faster 16X for my newer Panasonic recorder and, to my dismay, the stability and reliability of this batch has been inconsistent. Maybe the old 8X was manufactured differently, but I don't have the same confidence in the newer, faster product . Sometimes, in this new digital era, I actually long for the old Betamax/VHS days, because I didn't have to ""finalize"" everything, or worry about corruption of media during normal use."
1,I Got a Bad Batch,"I must have gotten a bad batch. Of the 50 discs, I managed to convince 17 to burn successfully. And before anyone starts, I tried multiple burn speeds, multiple disc images, and multiple drives.Seeing as how Verbatim is such a well respected brand, I can't help but think that I got a bad batch. And although I didn't analyze this scientifically, I kinda think that the disc location on the spindle influenced the likelihood of a successful burn. At any rate, I'll probably get different discs the next time I need to burn something."
1,High Failure Rate,"I had a very high failure rate with these disks (mainly they would not format after recording, some had dropouts). I switched to TDK and have not had a single failure since; so, the problem is not my recorder, it's these disks. In my opinion, these disks are trash.I noted that they carried no brand name (where one usually sees it at the hub).Added Oct 31 2010: I used the word ""format"" above. I meant to say ""finalize."""
4,Great,I have used Verbatim printable DVD's for some time now and have no complaints. They have performed very well on my MacPro. The best one to get is the glossy printable DVDs by Verbatim. Both have printed flawlessly on my Epson R200 & R220.
5,Great value for money,"The Verbatim printable hub DVD's are what I had been looking for! I use print settings of 25mm inner diameter and 117mm for the outer on my Epson Artisan 810. That leaves only a small ribbon of white both inside/outside. Most times they appear perfectly centered, not something you get much when using labels. You could probably get even closer if you wish to try.I have ordered a second spindle of 50 and was shocked to see that I am now paying $20 less than when I last ordered. At this price you need look no further for DVDs that allow printing on such a large surface area. Also, colors are much more vivid than on my DL DVD Taiyo Yuden Watershields.I have had 100% burn success this far, knock on wood."
2,Have no consistent quality!!!!!! Made in china,"I often use Verbatim dvd for movies and data; rarely having any problem. This time is a different story. Over 10 disks are wasted, even at the very beginning or half way of the burning process. I have a good disk, then a bad one on different tries. It is a data life time, but some have problem playing back after few months."
5,Awesome for long-term storage,"If you're like me, you burn DVD's because you want to store important data, data that you don't want to lose. And when you are storing your important data, you can't afford to mess around with inferior media (Memorex). I've been using these Verbatim DVD-R's for over a week (burning at 4X for max quality) and I am not disappointed. Using Nero's excellent Disc Quality test in their CDSpeed utility, these discs average about 0.00 PI failures and a little under 1.00 PI errors which is fantastic. Time will tell how good DVD's really are at long-term archival use, but I would expect these discs to keep your data safe for at least 10 years if stored properly. (in contrast, I've lost data burned to memorex discs in only 1 or 2 years)"
5,Twin Pack Ink,"There are not much to write about the description of the item since it is an ink.Just to remind you that the item has to be TWIN PACK as you see on the picture. If you receive one-pack, then you should talk and argue with your seller."
5,RCA AH19 Stereo Hook-Up Cable 6 ft AH19,Excellent product. Supplier shipped on time. Package and contents arrived in first-class condition. Would buy from this source in future.
1,For Audio or Non-Stereo Video connections Only,"There's nothing special about RCA Stereo Hook-Up Cable. Stereo is a misnomer. If you're connecting audio equipment to your Stereo system then the cable is completely appropriate but this cable doesn't have the VIDEO and Stereo Audio connection that's needed for a connection of your Stereo HiFi VCR to your OTHER Stereo HiFi VCR for dubbing.There's cheaper cable with ""gold"" connectors (though it makes little difference) available at your local dollar store for only a dollar. I suggest that as a better purchase."
5,Too Perfect,This product came on time and it was just TOO PERFECT becasue the groom is an advid fisherman. This was a great topper for the Grooms Cake. Recommend to anyone.
3,A Few Great Songs Does Not A Great CD Make,"""More Than Words"" -- overplayed, but still beautiful. ""Hole Hearted"" -- cool. ""Song for Love"" -- cheesy, but still solid. The rest is worth a once-over ... Wait -- I forgot to mention ""Flight of the Wounded Bumblebee"", the intro to ""He-Man Woman-Hater"". Nuts. Just crazy. I've been walking faster ever since I heard it. P.S. For a much better Extreme CD, check out ""III Sides to Every Story."""
2,A guitar shredder's paradise..but Funk of the 90s?,"Extreme,when they were still a band, claimed to be the face of 90s Funk. Sure, there are some nice hooks here and there. Nuno is a fine guitar player. Unfortunatly, Nuno realizes this all too well. Extreme's music is lacking the essential ingredient in funk which is breathing room. Any chance of a consistent funky groove is suffocated by Nuno's Van Halen/Malmsteen chops or Gary Cherone's Freddy-Mercury-meets-Brad-Delp vocal treatments. To prove that they are diverse,a few ballads are thrown in the mixture.(What better way to sell an album these days)? In 'Get The Funk Out' they sing: "" No rotten apple's gonna spoil my funk."" Mine either, so I'll avoid this apple. An album closer to 90's funk is the Chili Pepper's 'Bloodsugarsexmagic.' However, if you want to hear a 90's group with the musical indulgence of Cream and the staying power of Kajagoogoo, this may be your band. Just don't call it Funk cause it ain't."
2,A small mistake...,"I purchased the vinyl version of this album long ago, when I was 15. I was very impressed by the guitar skills of Nuno Bettencourt, and I liked the anthemic ""More Than Words"". Ten years after, I can safely say the album has lost most of its appeal: no one is interested anymore in faster-than-light guitar solos, and the metal-flavoured pop of these guys sounds quite silly, a useless heritage of 80s. Besides, in the same years a few really groundbreaking album surfaced (eg Pearl Jam's Ten, Nirvana's Nevermind) that showed where good rock music was heading, definitely away from this stuff. I consider Pornograffitti a mistake in my ""career"" as a listener."
5,Extreme - Pornograffitti,"I found this in dads CD collection amongst hordes of 70's, 80's and 90's music, and i just think this band are brilliant, Nuno Bettencourt is a hard act to follow, and i find that they are one of times forgotten rock bands, the talent they have was second to none, flight of the bumble bee on guitar... now that is 100% raw skill... there are very few bands that catch my eye, Extreme got my undivided attention!! 6/5 if you like rock then u really need to buy this CD Bettencourt is god! :)"
4,"I like this ""More Than Words"" can say.","I'll admit, I didn't give this much of a listen at the time, but since I recently have, Wow! I guess I could say I'm amazed at how good this is. I know they got tossed in with the hair-metal bands of the era, but they seem a step above that. This album does have many of those elements, but it's also pretty diverse. Besides plain rock, this also includes ballads, some songs like ""Get The Funk Out"", have a touch of ""Chili Peppers"" feel to them, and ""When I First Kissed You"" sounds like it should be on a ""George Michael"" album, be that good or bad. The opener ""Decadence Dance"" is great, I really like ""He man Woman Hater"", and of course the two huge songs ""Hole Hearted"" and ""More Than Words"" are here as well. The songs I didn't mention are all good too. Personally, I'd take this over their ""Best Of"" anyday."
5,Extreme&#65533;s best - Extremely good R-O-C-K,"I guess this was one of my absolute favourites when I was around 20. It still is. Great ROCK songs. You can feel the extreme joy the band has in playing. You can feel the fun they had putting together the lyrics. Feel the ""let's do it"" experimental ideas in the sometimes unorthodox details added before and after every piece.This is great fun, great lyrics (some might misinterpret them as very hostile and provoking and unethical - I just see them as pure fun and sarcastic satire).This is great rock, great music. Right from the speedy Pornograffitti, through the album's best piece He-Man Woman Hater to the beatiful jazzy ballad When I First Kissed You.EXTREMEly great satirical hardrock album!"
4,Solid Work,"This album is definitely worth checking out if you like your rock music with a metal-funk twist. There are a few ballads on this album (i.e. the well-known ""More than Words"", and ""Hole Hearted""), but the main focus remains on up-tempo numbers with unique twists. Nuno Bettencourt is as technically sound a guitartist as there is, and Gary Cherone provides suprising vocal range. In my opinion, the gem of this album is ""Get the Funk Out"".The only downside to this album is that some of the riffs and tempos tend to get a bit monotonous. Therefore, I would rank this album slightly behind it's sequel, ""3 Sides to Every Story"", only because ""3 Sides"" seemed to have a bit more creativity."
5,A Life Changing Musical Experience,"Quite frankly this album changed my life and shows the musical versatility of the band to the maximum. Switching from Funk Metal to Jazz to Ballad with seemingly motionless pattern. Off the back of this album and seeing the band perform encouraged me to try and emulate Nuno & the boys by picking up the Guitar. My band are now close to big things thanks to Nuno & Extreme. There's obviously the track 'More Than Words' that brought Extreme to the masses but it's more the tracks like 'It's a Monster' 'Decadence Dance' 'Pornograffitti' & 'He Man Woman Hater' that I still love over ten years on.These boys knew how to rock with the best of them, a timeless classic that I shall always have to the forefront of my record collection.You quite simply have never been 'funked' until you've listened to this album. Thanks boys!!"
4,Adaptor,Perfect adaptor to connect wet dry vac to table saw and other tools. Was for my husband to keep the diy projects manageable for me.
2,Okay for occasional use,"I purchased one of these Duromatics in mid 2004. Now a half a year latter, I'm ready to get rid of it. First off, the blue o-ring became damaged (torn) right away. Looking at the design of the lid, you see why. The ring doesn't lay flat, of course it's going to get torn. Wait until you price them.Next, take a good look at the handles. Why are they so small and close to the pot? Look at other manufactures handles, better placement less likely to get burned.Professional reviewers and kitchens refered to Rikon as the golden standard for pressure cookers. That maybe true for other models or during some other period in time. This is a real disappointment."
4,One of my favorites. Also second favorite cover art.,"While not an expert on Fleetwood Mac. I am familiar with all there work from ""Then Play On"" until ""Tusk"". I sorta got away from them after that. Anyway, this is definitely my favorite Mac offering post Mr. Kirwin."
4,Not your typical Fleetwood Mac,"The tracks on this album are rather unique from the Fleetwood Mac songs typically given airplay. The vocals on Emerald Eyes and Hypnotized are simply groovy, and the guitar work on Miles Away is pure rock. I'm not a big fan of Fleetwood Mac, but this album is a welcome exception."
3,Another Darker Fleetwood Mac,"Darker and moodier than the releases to follow with Stevie and Lindsay, buy it to get a true understanding of the Fleetwood Mac evolution."
2,mystery,"I purchased this CD because it was said to be a rare CD. I can see why. Not only was there only one fairly good song on it, I was very disappointed in my own stupidity to buy it. Thank God it was a used one and I only paid $5.00. It rally wasn't worth the shipping cost of $3.00. By the way, the case was broken when I received it; probably the post office made a bad purchase worse. Another one for the land-fill."
5,Excellent!,This is a wonderful pre Stevie and Lindsey part of FM. Christine McVie has this voice that draws you into her emotions thus you will never forget her melodious style.Bob Welch is complementary to the band and I was sad to see him leave but happy for his Bare Trees album.
5,Mystery to Me by Fleetwood Mac,"I owned this music in the early 70s when it first came out on vinyl (my first ""Mac"" album). So I took a chance and it sounds better than ever on CD. Fleetwood, McVie, & Christine prove they were the heart of a extra-ordinary band before their later mega-success. Bobs Welch and Weston add all you want with vocals, guitar, & songwriting. Glad I decided to re-visit this music."
4,This was my first experience with Fleetwood Mac,"Before Rumours this was the first album I listened to. Great stoner music, Bob Welch was such a good singer, too bad he left! Definetly in my top 5 FM CD's/Albums whichever. Joe"
3,A perfect disc,"Before Stevie Nicks, Bob Welch took the band into the mystical explorations. Mick Fleetwood claims the track, ""Hypnotised,"" gave Christine the chills. Other tracks, in the same vein, include ""Emerald Eyes,"" and my favourite: ""Keep on Going,"" which Christine actually sings. The legendary Ms. Perfect McVie, to her credit, is perfect on ""Believe Me."" In the context of her problems with John McVie, at least to hear Mick tell the story, that song is incredibly poignant. What a pity not all the songs quite live up to this high level. But nobody is perfect."
4,"Sounds familiar, but still a good read","Let's see, the Doctor's companion has to deal with living in one place and time, years pass, the Doctor is imprisoned, and alien insectoids are involved somehow. Now which novel am I talkng about?A. Set PieceB. Seeing IC. All of the aboveThe answer is C, of course.That said, I really enjoyed both novels. There was more focus on the Doctor trying to escape this prison, and although it happens several times, it's new and interesting each time. The changes that Sam goes through while trying to carve out a life for herself on an alien world are reminiscient of our own experiences in finding our way as new adults in our own world. This book went really quickly for me, and I was done before I knew it, and wanted more. The Orman/Blum gestalt always produces thoughtful, entertaining, and interesting stories, and this is no exception. Buy it now!"
2,"""Oh boohoo, the Dr. doesn't deserve to be ugly boohoo!""","This is the first of the ""New"" Dr. Who stories I have read, meaning the ""original"" stories that are not part of the series. I have got to say that it is one big soap-opra. Most of the scenes are with Sam on some Earth-like world doing Earth-like stuff. Booring. I read this about two years ago, so can only barely remember the scenes with Dr. Who. Most of the chapters are of Sam and her friends, or Sam and her new boyfriend blah! blah! blah! These books, all of them in my opinion, are like this. I don't know if it's the times(1999, 2000, 2001) or what but I guess people prefer soaps on another planet to adventure on another planet like the series. That is why these books have sold. That is why sci-fi shows today are so mushy(eg. Farscape, Star Trek, probably ""Enterprise"" released this fall, and Dr. Who if it was remade for today's audience, I guess I'm an old codger at age 30, don't know... Hmm!)"
2,Re-release of original work,"This was a book is a rewrite of one of several original books Joel published in 1949. The first God the Substance was a workbook of Joel's lectures given in Victoria Park. A word for word analysis shows a complete re-write of the original. For more information on this go to the[...]website. The original, unedited version is available to serious students."
3,Too Bad NOT original,"This is a fine book for the general public interested in Joel Goldsmith. However, if you are a serious student interested in learning the principles which will help you realize the nature of God, please hunt down the un-edited original."
2,Over hyped former prodigy,"Maxim is a over hyped former child prodigy. Among his generation, Gil Shaham, Joshua Bell, Kyoko Takezawa, Chee Yun, Christian Tetzlaff's intonation and music are more pleasing to my ears. Why I cannot find Kyoko and Chee Yun's records."
1,"flawed case, unhappy customer","Could this be one bad apple in the bunch? My SKB Baby Talor/Martin LX Hardshell case arrived recently, and I was unhappy to see that the bottom and top of the case did not close completely, but was warped by the handle and at the bottom of the case. At these two places there was a gap of about 1/4 inch high and about 6 to 8 inches in length. Thus, it looks like the appropriate humidity would not be maintained even with a humidity device in place within the case. Sadly, as one of many who is failing under the weight of an out of control economy, where even basic needs like food costs continue to rise dramatically, I am not able to afford to ship the item back. I will not order anything but books from Amazon from now on. I have, however, been pleased with all book orders.Jennifer VyhnakBristol, VT"
4,Good Insurance,"Although my Baby Taylor came with a travel case (a nice one at that), I decided that having a bit of insurance could go a long way. As there aren't too many cases that will nicely hold a 3/4-sized guitar, the SKB was my natural choice as it was highly rated. My guitar fits in there rather snugly (it takes very little effort to get it inside), and it doesn't move once placed inside. The only thing that caused this to get 4 stars instead of 5 is a minor, minor reason, but it had to be done; the latches (especially the one closest to the headstock), takes a little maneuvering to get them to latch properly. I feel that because the case locks, that makes up for this a bit.Overall, you can't go wrong with a hardcase, especially one of this quality."
5,Great guitar case,"If you own a Baby Taylor guitar or a Alvarez MSD1 like I do, then you must realize how difficult it is to find a hard shell case for your guitar. This SKB case is superb and very difficult to find. This guitar case is not a card board case. If you value your guitars then this a requirement for you to have. This my second SKB case. I purchased an SBK case for my 3/4 folk guitar. This case is also difficult to find. You will not be disappointed in either of these cases if you can find one to buy. The amazon merchant I bought this from was great and notified me of every step of the process. I had the case within seven days. Great case and great merchant."
5,Being Different,"Length:: 1:12 MinsI love all the books by Eric. This one talks about being different from others. Ellison couldn't trumpet like the other elephants. So they teased him. His mother told him ""All the greatest elephants in history were unusual - That's what made them great!"" But he is still discouraged when he meets a weasel who encourages him to try different sounds with his trumpet. Ellison closed his eyes and concentrates a beautiful sound cames out. All the elephants want to see what is making that wonderful music.This story helps you to teach your children that being different is how you can become great. The world doesn't need everyone to be the same and there is nothing wrong with the gift you have."
4,A great story,"We bought 3 of Drachman's books with CD for our 4 1/2 year old daughter who is crazy about audio books in the car. The story is simple but endearing and the art is very lovely. I like how the readers on the CD sound like real people and the sound effects are fun too. My daughter enjoys reading it without the CD as well. My only concern is that she is now mimicking the way the child/Ellison speaks. Either the reader naturally has a speech impediment or it was put on for the story. While I can see value in having this in books so kids with similar problems can realize others are like them too, it's not so good for kids who love to mimic. Now, my daughter mispronounces all the L words. So I will have to put away the books until she gets over this phase. Edna and Leo is not as pronounced so we still enjoy those. If your kid does not mimic, then you will probably love this book."
2,It's okay,"From the other reviews I was expecting something fantastic. Instead, the whole thing is so-so. The story is not very interesting or creatively told. Yes, it holds a good message but that is not the only point of reading a book- I like to hear pleasing or clever language too. Also, the artwork is all dull colors and the animals are not cute-just kinda blah. I expect a lot better artwork in a children's book. Finally, the weird accent of the kid who does Ellison on the cd and the annoying voice of Weasel make the cd something I don't want to play as an adult. My daughter likes it but doesn't ask to hear it on her own."
2,The author is an avatar of Dullness,"I am neither a Sanskritist nor practitioner of Hinduism. I am not qualified to evaluate the author's biases, hidden or revealed, in writing on Hindu traditions and literature. I would just add my voice here on this point: the book is written in an exceedingly dull manner. The prose is stilted, lifeless, and lacking in both content and colour. The bibliographies are useful, and I appreciate references to the original texts from which the tales are (poorly) retold. But overall it's simply too drab to be much more than an anthology of cold prose. I didn't think it was possible to make Kali-Ma sound boring -- but this author succeeded."
1,Trash,"Silly book by a sex-obsessed author - Freudian analysis to explore religion? At best, one can describe it as the product of an over-imaginative mind, but it's certainly not a book on Hindu religion, because it interprets the religion in ways that the practitioners never intended or even imagined. ""Your interpretation of my beliefs reflects the way you think, not the way I think."""
1,Good for Humour reading,"This book meant for lay people who are interested in the Rgveda, ends up presenting a completely wrong picture. The translations are pathetically bad. Most unreliable book on the Rigveda - I guess we get what we pay."
4,A good intro book written by someone smarter than you,"I read this book for Professor Doniger's class at the University of Chicago. I can't say that I absolutely loved it, but on the whole it was an excellent introduction to Hinduism with a widespread selection of relevant myths.I'm really writing this review to debunk the other reviews on this site. Chances are the reviewers who charged the author of innaccurate translating or having a Judeo-Christian agenda either (1) don't realize the extent of Prof. Doniger's expertise or (2) are just idiot Hindus with their own narrow views of their religion. Unless these reviewers are scholars themselves, I doubt they know enough about Hinduism to make these charges. Don't listen to them."
1,Hindu Myths,"Lousy book,wouldn't be be surprised if the author is a rightwing Christian fanatic.Save your money."
1,Broke already,We have only had this product a few weeks and it is already broken. Not too disappointed though since it was so cheap. You get what you pay for.
5,did what it was supposed to -- I'm happy,"I needed an adapter because while the stereo receiver lights were lit, no sound came out of the speakers, and I didn't know if it was the receiver or the speakers. Thought if I could find some old-school big plug headphones I could plug them in and if I could hear sound, then I knew it was the speakers. Couldn't find that type of earphones, just my earbuds. So I bought this, plugged in the buds, and it worked! But why weren't the speakers working? Since there were 2 outputs for speakers, I switched the wires from the A speakers to B speakers on the receiver and voila! no need to buy a new receiver. This item saved me hundreds of dollars!"
3,Works ok.,"Did not entirely fit my earbuds (was slightly too large), but gave reasonable sound quality. Worked ok with different headphones."
1,Doesn't fit standard headphone plug!,"This product was very disappointing. The 3.5mm portion of the adapter is bigger than it should be, and all three of the headphone sets I tried just fall out of the adapter with any light force on the cord. If there isn't any force at all pulling the plug out of this adapter, the sound quality is fine, but the second the SMALLEST little force pulls on the cord, it just falls right out. This thing is useless, and it's cheap enough that it doesn't make sense for me to even ship it back. Just not happy with this at all."
1,Buy it if you want a MONO jack,"I should have read ""Faulty"" below. The adapter provided by LowerPriceUSA was not a stereo adapter. Yes it fits in a stereo plug but there are only two contact surfaces not three on the male end, shown in the photo, which is required for STEREO. I tried to send it back. They asked for a picture. Amazing, even when a picture was sent they thought nothing was wrong with it. I just had to write this up. I know that I never want to buy from lwrpriceusa again. Anyhow, no big loss."
1,Faulty,"I didn't realize theAudio-Technica ATH-M2X Open-Back Dynamic Stereo HeadphonesI bought came with their own adapter, so I bought this. The one I got was faulty, sound comes out mono unless you wiggle it around a bit - and when you do get stereo to come out, it sounds worse than the unit that came w/ my headphones. Must be a loose connection or something inside the adapter.I'd return it, but considering how cheap it was, probably not worth the effort. I'd be wary next time though."
2,Substitute Teacher's Reference Manual,"This book does help you think about some things you wouldn't normally think about, and there are some helpful worksheets in the back for emergency use and background school information. However, the book is not worth paying money for. I would see if you could check it out at your local library, if not no great loss."
1,Waste of time and money,"I started Substitute teaching and was looking for a guide to help me out. This manual had only common sense knowledge, and only a few craft ideas, many of which were similar to asking a child to draw a picture. There were no creative ideas to help new teachers. There were mechanical errors all over, and worst of all, the author referred to children as ""munchkins"" and ""gremlins""! They are children, not creatures. Do not waste your money on this book."
2,Not much substance,"This is a small, flimsy spiral bound book which is an easy 20minute read. It is extremely basic information for a sub with NOexperience. It has a few interesting activity ideas (although morethan 50% of the book is activity ideas), and some simple, sound advice. I am returning this book for something with more substance."
3,Not bad from a hack nslash and platformer fan.,This is no platformer. It does not have enough variety for that. Pretty much go from level to level killing the bad guys in a very pretty setting with different weapons with similar killing powers. It is not good enough to be a great hack-n-slash game like Lord of the rings. This is an average game that could have been great if some decent variety had been included. Bottom line: As it stands pick it up used if you have to have a slasher game. Otherwise wait for something better to come along.
4,Fun game,"Was a little disappointed, as I thought this was the sequel to the original :MediEvil"" - but this is basically the same game, but with some additional levels and other things added. Still a fun game."
3,Fun but not as good as the original.,"I loved the classic Medievil, so finally decided to give this a shot. It was fun, but not nearly as good as the original. I kinda felt like the developer was making fun of Medievil the entire time I was playing it. They made it seem as if Sir Dan was mentally disabled and there was a worm that lived in his skull(literally) that was always telling Dan what to do. They also skipped out on a lot of memorable stuff from the original game. If your a huge fan of Medievil, I would suggest you pass this up. If you know nothing about the original, by all means enjoy the new version."
3,Blast from the past,"I bought this game for my PSP because I remember playing the demo for the original PlayStation, and this was when I was 9, and scared to bits. It's a nice classic and I look forward to beating the game without screaming in terror. They really did a nice job retouching the graphics."
3,3 Disc Set Collector's Edition,Has the exact same episodes sold in the 2 Disc 10 Classic Episodes Bonanza Collection
3,GOOD BUT NOT AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT,"I LIKE THIS BOOK. PURCHASED IT FOR A FRIEND AND THEN GOT MY OWN. IT'S A MUST HAVE!!! IT HAS GREAT IDEAS, DIRECTIONS, PICTURES, DRAWINGS, ETC."
3,Coffee Table Book,Great coffee table book. Beautiful photography. Info about celebrity weddings but not a practical wedding planning book by any means. This book is all about getting ideas from celebrity weddings and inspiration. This would be a nice book to look through to take a break from wedding planning and advice books and just to get a feel for what kind of a wedding you want and what that might look like.
3,Makes a great coffee table book,"The pictures were very nice. But I agree, it is more of an idea and reference book than anything else."
4,"Not too great of a resource, but great pictures","If you want a book to look at wedding-related pictures, this is a pretty good one. It has a little bit of planning information, but it really isn't that helpful. It has several pages on some celebrity weddings and it may give you some good ideas. It just isn't something that you need when you're planning your wedding because it isn't loaded with that much information. For example, it has several pages just talking about the engagement ring, which you don't need information on because you probably already have the ring if you're planning your wedding. It's a great visual book, but not a great resource."
5,Wow! What a book!,"I saw this book in Amazon together with Martha Stewart's Wedding Book and since I admire Style's Wedding magazine, I decided to purchase this book. What a great find! It has ideas on every aspect of the wedding. Lots of very cool ideas. I particularly like the ideas for photos and beauty. Definitely worth it."
5,Britney's #1 Fan!,"Ok, Britney. This book was great, I couldn't put it down. It had quizzes and it had this one quiz that I loved. It was actually hard for me. It was interesting it had an interview with her, a 50 question quiz, and 50 fun facts. It had pictures from Britney's concerts or Britney and her fans. It had pictures of Britney just hanging out. It had pictures of Britney through out her school years. Ith ad also information on Britney that I didn't even know. So if you are a Britney fan this book is for you. If you think you know Britney well, you don't! Not until you read this book. Plus, her little sister Jamie Lynn is absolutely gorgeous just like Britney."
5,Great Notebook Case!,I bought this for my new Dell Inspiron E1505. This case is perfect for it. It has allot of space to hold extra stuff as well. No negatives I can see.Shipping was fast. Great to do business with!
4,Even Heat,This line of cookware is constructed for even heat and I am pleased with how things cook in it. I wish it had a big heavy lid so that I could use it for a chicken fryer. They may make that piece but I haven't seen it.
5,Good fit - All functions usable without Taking cover,"This Case is worth every penny I paid for( may be more). It let you use all functions without opening the cover.It fits the Phone very snug(or tight). Keypad as well is screen is covered so, no scratches there too.I was skeptical about usability of the Keypad with cover on, but it is not a problem at all.Is this product without drawbacks, yes there are few.Like phone looses it's sleek look.Phone top corners are exposed, so potential for damage when dropped upside down.I wish the belt clip hook is removable.I wish Camera lense has cover. But this one protects pretty well as the opening is only lens size.All in all, it is worth it."
3,"Range Box?, Cleaning kit?",It's big. A bit too big to use as a range box. The gun supports do not fit well into the box making for akward storage. The bottom is not tall enough to store aerosol cans upright. I am glad I have it but would look at the smaller one next time. It seems a bit flimsy. when it is locked up it is OK. Affordable solution for a catch all..
3,Solid case,The construction is solid but the method of attaching the two halves of the gun rest leaves something to be desired. Overall it was a good deal.
4,good case,"Big enough to hold all my gun cleaning supplies for multiple guns. Wish the clip on gun rests could attach to the outside of the box-they kill a lot of space inside, but this is the larges case I have seen yet."
3,"Yes, it's a big box....","It is large, and I had to figure out the right way to store the rifle yokes, to use the most available space in the bottom of the box. The yokes them selve's were not that hard to put on....look at the picture with the box, on-line, etc. It would have been QUITE a better box had they made the lid just a little bigger and incorporated a way to store the yokes on there. It is wide and deep, yet not deep enough to store your average spray can of gun lube, de-greaser, or what ever, up right (gotta lay them down in the bottom of the box too). I also had to re-drilled the holes in the tray for the rifle rod accessories! Not a bad product, not a great one either. I like it for what it is-a parts, cleaning box"
4,"Good, but could use some design improvements.","This is actually the second one I bought. I use them as rocketry box when I go fly rockets. Fits most everything I need, except the rockets, of course. My only real complaint is the Gun Rests don't securely attach to the case. I don't use them so that's not a major issue for me. However, if I were to use them I would make some sort of screw bolt attachment so they are secure."
4,Range Box,"Comes in handy to carry multi pistols to the line. Pleanty of room for both pistols and ammo in the bottom section, and your tools in thetop carry handle section."
4,Great case...on the big side but room for all the stuff,"This was a great purchase for all the shooting supplies. There is plenty of room for all your cleaning supplies up top and ammo, glasses, etc. down below for a day at the range.The cleaning rack is difficult to get on as noted by other purchasers but this is really not an issue because it is a good positive connection that you can depend on while cleaning your firearms.Not a bad thing that I can say about this purchase. It arrived on time and I am pleased with the item so far."
4,Plano XL Shooters Case,"The rough dimensions on this are: 20 in wide, 10.5 in deep, and 11 inches high. The case IS huge but it will hold much of your cleaning gear. The lift out top tray can hold jags and other small essentials.Putting on the gun rests was a bit of a challenge since there are no instructions. It made me feel like I was taking an IQ test. But I managed to find a picture on the Plano site, import it into my photo editing software and adjusted the gamma so I could really see how it was supposed to go together.The two guns rest pieces are meant to go on with their finished side pointing in towards the box itself. You have to push down rather forcefully to get them to slide into position, but once that is done they are pretty secure.Great for a gun cleaning/storage all in one unit and the material is virtually indestructable."
3,Good but not great,"It took awhile to figure out how the two holders secured to the sides of the case. First, it looked like they rested on top. With some effort, I finally figured out that you had to push the gun holders down. There were no instructions or diagrams. The case is large. It would help to have some dividers on the lift-out tray, or in the main case below. The photo appears like there are dividers, but there aren't. It is a large case with plenty of room for storage. It also is very light. I rate it average for the price"
3,FLIMSY }:) AND HUGE,"Much bigger than I expected, however that is not really as much of an issue as it feels and is flimsy and cheap , I would not recommend this product to friends or enemies lol"
3,Needs Improvements,"Problems include absence of either a diagram or instructions as how to mount gun yokes (see similar comments). Back gun yoke split completely in two pieces during first usage. Left exterior ""hinge"" distorted with two contact points twisted away from channel on first use. I'm an experienced, mature gun handler with a reputation for ""good hands"" and not forcing components.OK for maintenance items storage, but not sure if ammo could be dry stored."
1,No Joy,"I was enchanted by the description, photos and low cost of this Shooters Case. However, five minutes after unpacking, it went back in the shipping box for return. What I liked: It was plenty big. What I did not like: Real flimsy plastic - too thin and flexible, warped tray, cheesy latches, inadequate provision for locking, bad color (mine looked like pea soup and mustard -- nothing like the deep, dark earth color in the picture. Sorry Plano... I calls 'em like I sees 'em."
5,35% gain following Wade's stock split advice,"Last Spring I noticed EBAY was listed on stock split candidates on WIN. I began buying @ (dollars) and held it until the recent announcement and sold EBAY @ (dollars) for a nice 35%= return.I know that Wade's ever present detractors will blast this by saying that I had to wait a few months. But aren't these the same guys talking ""buy and hold""???Sorry to hear that Wade's company is in Ch. 11 but am EXTREEEEMELY grateful for WIN and the advice in Red Light Green Light and THE Wall Street Money Machine series."
5,Doubled my money in 1 day! Thanks WADE!,"Following WADE's advice from his new MUST website, I bought calls on HPQ prior to expected news that Wade had predicted and came true and doubled my money in 1 day! Thanks WADE!"
5,80% 2 day return - Thanks Wade!,I made a 80% return over a 2 day period by buying options on Multimedia on a post stock split run.I have also made H-U-G-E- returns following Wade's advice on earnings and news announcements as per this book. The advice works---if you use it.Great book...Great author.
3,For the serious soap maker,"This book is VERY detailed for the person who is going to get into serious soapmaking, supplies, ingredients and all. It provides all the information and illustration you'd need. Personally, I was looking for more of a hobbiest Melt & Pour kind of thing and I couldn't tell by the synopsis on the Amazon page whether or not this was. (it's not...) HOWEVER - I kept the book because it has excellent descriptions of ingredients for ANY soapmaker. It also has a super section on suppliers. That alone is worth the price as, again, whether a serious or hobbiest soap maker, you'll need soap supplies. Catherine Failor obviously knows soap and educates you with this detailed guide."
5,And 3 makes a perfect set,"Every one of these 3 mandala coloring books is a precious masterpiece. I've enjoyed them for years, and love to introduce them in classes that I teach on relaxation and healing. The variety and endless appeal to the adults and children in my classes keep them on my list of teaching tools. It's fun to see the adults fighting over who gets to color which mandala...until they realize, there's always enough for everyone. While they touch hearts, they also seem to introduce the idea of hope in some patients and family members who have lost their way.I've purchased and tried many other similar books---but I always come back to this classic set. Any or all of the 3 are precious tools for healing and restoration."
3,Anolon Advanced 5-Quart Covered Saute Pan,"I worked for Williams-Sonoma for 8 years and know my pans. I was looking for a good sized pan with a cover for my wife. Most of the top end cookware, like All-Clad, Calphalon, etc. are great pans and worth their high price tages as they will last forever. But Anolon offered this pan at a more reasonable price. Let say this...the pan is great in design, appearance, and function -- but if you don not know how to use a stainless-steel pan successfully, find a nonstick version. My wife burns things in this pan almost everytime, and it is a hassle to get the pan clean."
4,how societies work,"Coleman's Foundations of Social Theory is a tour de force of using game theoretic methods to explain social interactions. Much of the book concerns finding explanations for how and why people behave in groups. Some of the best parts focus on everyday group behaviors, such as bank runs and fashion fads. This is a pretty tough book to wade through, not because of the author's writing style but rather because he packs a lot in. I would definitely advise tackling this only after you feel comfortable with game theory, preferably having taken a class or two. If you can get through it though there are some rich insights in the book."
4,Challenging,"It was not easy to read through this. But, for those who wanna try something other than usual in sociology, I think this book will do. Don't you think the truth about our society is still out there? We have come here and it's too far away from the truth. ..and I think sociology is left land which will be fertile in some centuries. I think this book started first for searching another method to the gold, truth. Not just because it introduced mathematical view in sociology ,but because it showed us a new way of proceeding."
5,I like it!,"I use it with the TV in the bedroom. It's perfect because of it's size and because it can be installed vertically. I have it standing on-end right next to the TV. Even better, the remote is programmable to operate different brands of televisions. Except for one thing... it operates everything else on my Panasonic television except the power function (?). As for features, it does more than I will ever need it to do."
2,Won't stand behind product,"After 14 months of on and off problems with machine, I sent it to the service center where I received a bill that was more than the machine was worth. Sony would not stand behind product."
5,On the road-its great!,"Installed this little gem in our Explorer Conversion van. It slipped perfectly into the Nintendo holder. It plays just fine thru the van's TV/tape system. You'll need a 12v > 10.5v converter (from the Shack) @ nineteen $mackers. The A/V hookups are standard...you'll have to pull the Nintendo away from the wall to get to the van system...easy. Been on the road for several long trips now... NO SKIP! With the rebate, you have instant DVD on the road for $... !! perfect!!"
1,Unreliable,"After one year of use, it refuses to play all DVDs and half of my CDs. Be careful with this one."
4,won this from game show network,"i thought id write this ...not so much as to rate it(only had a month now) but to let you people know this is one of the prizes featured on the ""greedinteractive"" sweepstakes on gameshownetwork.com..i won this thru the promotion.very nice to own something like this never had one b4 . i noticed air force plays better than what it did on abc...u can tell the difference there is no comparision.i cant get angle to work can somebody help me with this tyvmharv"
3,"nice, but nothing special","i was just wanting a basic wool blanket to use for meditation and yoga to protect me from the earth's electromagnetic pull. this blanket serves this purpose although i can not get it to stop shedding, i have little pieces of wool everywhere and all over myself when i do yoga."
2,Ok but not great,"The blanket was thin, course and has a smell. It is ok but not what I expected or wanted. I would not recommend it."
1,Oily Smell and Residue,"The yoga wool blankets smelled very strongly of ""machine oil"" that no amount of airing would remove. There was an oily residue left on my hands and one of the blankets shed so badly that if you had used it you would be covered with large purple fluff from head to toe. Also had trouble with my return until Amazon stepped in to help."
2,Self-important Jumble,"Charles Pellegrino's stream-of-consciousness ramblings about the eruption of Mount Vesuvius and the collapse of the Twin Towers offer excellent descriptions of just how such catastrophes play out, but little else of interest. Reading the book is an exercise in frustration; just when the author throws out juicy tidbits regarding Pompeii or Herculaneum, he veers off into discussions of conditions on Earth in 1,000,000 B.C. or Gnostic philosophy. Pellegrino clearly possesses an active, imaginative mind but, just as clearly, has difficulty focusing it on something as mundane as maintaining focus. In this manner he reminds one of Tim Robbins' baseball pitcher Nuke LaLoush in ""Field of Dreams,"" who possessed a phenonomenal fastball but was just as apt to hit the team mascot as the strike zone. In ""Ghosts of Vesuvius,"" Pellegrino throws a few strikes. Unfortunately, these are overshadowed by his spectacular wild pitches. Mascots, and readers, beware."
4,A good bet,"Even though it can be a little precious in places, this book is extremely insightful and very beautiful. It gives an ancient tragedy a very human and personal feeling--I found myself in tears at many junctures. Well done."
3,Lizzy Borden's new image,"Remember Lizzy Borden? I mean ""Love you to Pieces"", ""Visual Lies"", ""Master of Disguise"", etc. Well Starwood are the same lineup than the one that recorded the ""Deal with the Devil"" album except for guitar player Joe Nelson (RIP).The band sounds good, 80's hard rock style.If you like bands like Motley Crue, Guns & Roses, Skid Row, you should buy this CD, but don't expect to listen Lizzy Borden."
5,Fantastic.,A sharp and sophisticated read that gives you much more than a mystery. How could you not fall in love with Anne and the world she actively persues?
3,a romance story that is hard to swallow,"I was looking forward to an Agatha Christie suspense mystery when what this delivered was an overly long romance novel. Others have said that Ann is Agatha's ideal woman, independent, willful, intelligent, quick, and risk-taking. But as Sir Eustes says in the novel, she's an amateur making illogical moves and choices. Her fearlessness goes beyond naivete. Not much of this novel is plausible, and the explanations at the end are long and drawn out. Ho hum, I got through it, but cannot recommend it. I suppose in 1924 it was spectacular."
3,A bit too of its time,"My grandmother left me her collection of Agatha Christie novels and, over the years, I've been trying to make time to read them in chronological order. I've just finished reading ""The Man in the Brown Suit"" and, while I did find it intriguing and suspenseful, I found it a bit too mired in the melodrama of the day. When a female character suddenly protests "" But I love him!"" about a character she's just barely met, it's a bit difficult to believe. The mystery is fun and the globe-trotting storyline is exciting to follow, but the romance hurts the overall story rather than helping it. I look forward to reading more of her books to see when (if?) she moved past such melodrama and let mystery and suspense lead the way."
4,An ideal read for a warm bath after a stressful day.,"The Man in the Brown Suit is one of my favorite Christie novels that does not fit into one of her regular character series. Much more of an unashamed romance than her other novels, it is an ideal read for a warm bath after a stressful day. Anne makes a delightful detective and intrepid reporter. Identities are switched. Villains are not quite what they seem. The world is traveled. A good time is generally had by all.The Man in the Brown Suit is Christie's fourth novel, and was published in 1927. Recommended."
1,THIS BOOK IS FULL OF STINK,IT WAS A VERY BORING BOOK. MOST OF THE CONTENTS ESPECIALLY THE PAGES WERE FULL OF STINK. THATS ALL.
5,Great escapist reading!,"This is one of my favorite Christie books. I wish she'd written more of this genre (adventure/mystery/romance as opposed to straight mystery). There is another that's very similar to this called _They Came to Bagdad_, also of the same type: plucky young heroine, alone in the world, embarks on an adventure. Both books take this formula and infuse it with excitement, wit, and a lot of local color. Highly recommended!"
5,Thrilling,"This is one of my favorite Christie mysteries. Even though Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are missing, the deductions and suspense are present in abundance.The plot revolves around a young girl who is suddenly without family and longs for adventure. Sure enough, little time passes before she finds it, and romance as well. The book travels from England to north Africa, and through many plot twists and turns.The characters are, as usual in a Christie novel, charming and engaging, and you root for this cunning woman to find the answer to the mystery, as well as love.A must read"
1,BORING!,"I'm a 13 year old looking for an adventure, and my school library had this. I thought i'd give it a shot since my sister read the ABC murders and liked it. I got about 2 pages in and practically fell ASLEEP! I got to all of 50 pages before i couldn't stand it and gave it back. WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ!!!!!!"
5,Awsome adventure of a young woman!,"Intriguing concept of 'Anne"" writing her narrative of events and 'Sir Eustice Peddler's' narrative from his diary, combining to tell the whole story of Anne's adventures in Africa. Especially fun is the ""red herring"" Paget, secretary to Sir Eustice.One of my favourite Christy books."
2,"Agatha, not your best!","I am a converted Agatha Christie fan who had not heard much of this book before, and now I know why.A 'perils of plucky Anne'. Quite disappointing."
3,This is not the new video series,This is not the current video series now running on public television. This is a very old series. The new series is called Rick Steves Europe.
5,An Extremely Intense Album,"Temple of the Dog was a one-off project put together with members of Soundgarden (Chris Cornell, Matt Cameron) and a group of of musicians who soon became known as Pearl Jam (Jeff Ament, Stone Gossard, Mike McCready and singer Eddie Vedder). Singer Chris Cornell wrote much of the lyrics and music, making him a dominant force on this release.The album and this project came about because it was inspired by friend/ex-Mother Love Bone singer Andrew Wood (who was a former friend/roommate and band mate to these musicians, but died of an overdose). So the album contains very insightful, powerful and emotional ballads like ""Say Hello 2 Heaven"" and ""Hunger Strike"", which show the mourning over their friend. The sizzling guitar solos and tracks along with Cornell's powerful slightly off-pitched vocals make this an extremely intense album."
5,Grunge Band In Mourning,"With the passing of Andrew Wood(lead singer Mother Love Bone), roomate Chris Cornell(Soundgarden) and band members Jeff Ament(Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam) and Stone Gossard(Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam) wrote a colaboration of songs outpouring their deepest emotions. This albumn is the purest most musical form of mourning(and we all know what kind of impact raw emotion has on music). Definately a must have for any Pearl Jam or Soundgarden fan. Additional lead guitars by Mike McCready(Pearl Jam); Drums, Matt Cameron(Soundgarden, Pearl Jam); Additional voice, Eddie Vedder(Pearl Jam). Contains hit singles, Say Hello 2 Heaven, Reach Down and Hunger Strike. If you say you love grunge and don't get this albumn, you don't love and appreciate grunge. If you like this albumn, check out Ten(Pearl Jam), Vs.(Pearl Jam) and Superunknown(Soundgarden)"
2,this cd is a dog,"very little to recommend here, especially when compared to the last 2 soundgarden discs or pearl jam material. the production on it is very poor, sounding like it was processed thru a coffee can. i listened to it once. probably won't listen again. and believe me...i'm a huge cornell fan. buy audioslave instead for more mature & polished material."
2,"Grunge is dead, people!!!","Though the joining of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden had its pleasant moments on this record, this is mostly B-side material. Chris Cornell can't hold a candle to the new-kid-on-the-block, Chad Kroeger of Nickelback, or the guy from Staind. While Cornell writes very self-involved lyrics, Kroeger writes in a more universal manner, thereby letting everyone into his world. Cornell's world is only drugs, grunge, and Seattle cafes.Ed Vedder sort of picks the record up with his vocal contribution on ""Hunger Strike,"" but it's not enough to save this complete wreck of an album. Heck, this stuff wasn't even too hip in the early 90's, so why would it be any good now?For true grunge check out Creed, Bush, Staind, Default and of course, the legendary Nickelback.Well, I hope this helped you in your selection process."
3,"Not a bad album, but not great either","This album has great moments, such as ""Say hello to heaven"", the ""duet"" with Vedder ""Hunger Strike"", and ""Wooden Jesus"". But there are also some rather weak moments, like the way too long ""reach down"". Overall, I would recommend this album if you are a cornell and pearl jam fan. Otherwise, I would recommend downloading the highlights."
5,aiysgfbv,"great CD, a tribute album by soundgarden and MLB, along with Ed Vedder (current PJ + Chris Cornell) for Andrew Wood, lead singer of MLB who OD'd. Probably Cornell's best album."
5,Don't forget Matt!!!!!,"Everyone else got it about right on their reviews. Chris' vocals have never been better and the guitarist's pumped out (arguably) their best work. But, hardly anyone, (if anyon) mentioned Matt Cameron's drum work. Absolutely phenomenal as it always was. My personal favorite drummer."
5,Seminal Grunge,"Matt Cameron on drums. Chris Cornell on vocals. Mike McCready and Stone Gossard on guitar. Jeff Ament plays bass. The term 'supergroup' would not mean anything if it weren't for this band. More songwriting and performing talent was present in the studio for TotD than any other record I own. While Eddie Vedder only appears on Hunger Strike, Chris Cornell's voice makes a surprisingly good counterpoint to Mike McCready's wailing guitars, which absolutely dominate this record. 'Reach Down' is a ten-minute epic prayer to the god of Rock, with a great solo followed by stunning a capella. 'Call Me a Dog' is one of Cornell's true lyrical masterpieces. Of course, if you had to pick five songs to define the Seattle movement, 'Hunger Strike' would be on the list. The PJ guys' ability to do 'mellow' allows Cornell to cut loose on songs like this a lot more than he did with Soundgarden."
5,A welcome and enthusiastically recommended addition,"Woolley Fox American Folk Art Rug Hooking by expert needlecrafter and rug hooker Barbara Carroll is divided into three major sections, Part I tours the Wooley Fox guesthouses and classroom, Barbara's wool collection, and introduces the reader to the art of rug hooking.

Beautifully and profusely illustrated throughout, Barbara Carroll's Woolley Fox American Folk Art Rug Hooking is a welcome and enthusiastically recommended addition to any personal, academic, professional, or community library needlecraft instructional reference collection."
1,"""POOR IMAGE""","THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MIKE PINERA WAS A GREAT MUSICIAN AND HIS WORK REVITALIZED IRON BUTTERFLY.....""BUT"".....THIS TWO ON ONE OFFERING IS VERY MEDIOCRE AND FAILS TO CAPTURE THE ATTENTION OF THE LISTENER.A LOT OF FILLER AND THE SECOND SET OF MATERIAL DOES NOT HAVE PINERA IN THE BAND.THE BLUES IMAGE ARE BEST REMEMBERED FOR THEIR HIT ""RIDE CAPTAIN RIDE"",A GREAT TUNE FROM THE 70'S,BUT NOTHING ON THIS DISC COMES CLOSE TO THAT!!!THE TWO ALBUMS ON THIS DISC WERE DELETED AND OFFERED IN THE BARGAIN BIN AT MY STORE FASTER THAN YOU CAN SAY ""VINYL HEAVEN""$$$$$SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,A Mixed Bag,"Well, being a fan of BI from way back, I was really looking foward to a cd release of their albums. Right from the start, the poor sound quality (loud hissing-especially when using headphones) of the first album, sort of ruined the listening experience, but the quality of R,W & BI was much better, almost as good as the lp. The first album sounds a bit dated and is more jazzy, bluesy with a latin flavor. It probably would have sounded better with producer Richard Podolar, who produced their other albums. The opening track of R,W & BI (Rise Up) is a different version from the lp. This version is an alternate/extended version. Maybe it is actually the original version.Although R,W & BI is not their best effort, it is very well produced and if you like the style of Ride Captain Ride (which is on the OPEN album), I think you will like most of this album.IMO, OPEN is the best BI album."
4,another freda payne or edna wright?,"Eloise Laws has talent. Few people knew that in the late 70's when she did not have the commercial chance to show it do to label's disputes and weak support. She has that Freda Payne, Edna Wright nasal voice very sensual and sings with heart. This album has a overseen gem ""You Got Me Love You Again"" that will make you move and sing it while listening to it!"
1,DONT BOTHER,This is not one of her better recordings...really dont waste your money. its such a shme they have not released her ABC records release or her self titled album recorded on Liberty records.This woman has an amazing voice one that really should be listened to but this albums material is just shocking.....bad recording sound also...Go get The Key and Secrets both fantastic.
3,Ozium,"This product smells terrible, but, I do believe it takes care of odors. If something could be done about the scent, I would highly recommend this product. I am not sure it completely removes smoke smell however."
4,Clears the Air,"This product is effective in clearing the air, but you really can't stay in the room right after spraying it. I don't care for the fact that you can't use it on fabrics since that is where some of the odors linger."
4,If you're having a baby,"If you're having a baby, Brighter Baby is something worth watching. It details how and why baby massage can help your child develop in the very early days of life, and it's a wonderful activity to learn about. The product is VERY specific in its instructions on the HOW TO side of things, and would make a great gift item for anyone who is 'expecting'."
4,"Surprised, great for intermediate conversation , listening","I speak spanish not too badly. I've studied Italian from a few paperbacks and parts of CD courses, liked Michel Thomas the best and listened to 8-10 hours worth (it really jump-starts you if you've puttered with self-study or know Spanish). But EZ Barrons, it has a lot of material, both for reading and listening, lots and lots of interesting conversational vignettes and episodes, spoken in real but probably 'extra clear' Italian for the foreign learner. I can't say whether this will teach you Italian from ""word one"" 'cause I didn't start there. But if you know some Spanish or studied some Italian at one point, this will probably be very helpful for invigorating your memory and helping you understood a wide variety of basic conversations. Also quite a bit of reading to review and learn from."
4,A great CD for an evening in,"I heard Terry Disley on a trip to San Francisco in April. I liked his music so much that I bought the CD. I have not been disappointed. It is easy listening, perfect over dinner with a glass of wine. Shame the CD is not available from Amazon in UK, especially as Terry is English."
1,Not always what you think,"Yes, I read this book when it was first published and thought what a wonderful story. With some brilliant editing and highly tuned selective memories the Buttons have indeed created an unparalled love story. However, I know the Buttons and know that what you read isn't exactly the whole story. The Buttons are extremely selective in their collective experiences, the sharing and dispensing of love with family and friends, and think nothing of flattening others personal feelings along the way. Their inner social circle places them on such an elevated status that one cannot, nor should not disagree with the Buttons. With all this said, I have found a perfect use for this book, it makes for a good door stop."
2,No widescreen version!,Too sad.I have widescreen TV and this dvd is annoying.It has only full screen format.
3,Okay...but emphasizes special effects,"This is a nice kids movie...but pretty stereotypical story line. Clearly devised to show off the Disney special effects. Can be scary for a 5 year old. Kids characters are stereotypes. And of course, it is the one girl who needs rescuing!"
5,A great classic!,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid, and loving every second of it! And, what do you know? I still do to this day!Very creative story, great characters, all around good clean fun for everyone!"
4,Rick Moranis's best film yet! besides Ghostbusters of course,"In this film Joe johnson director makes a movie about kids getting shrunk and spend days in the backyard it seems like a jungle to them! And it shows a close up of what lives in the grass of the back or front yards! like they run into giant Ants, giants Squrpions, and giant bees + other things that seem small to us YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! Also see these films Honey I blew up th kid & Honey we shrunk ourselves"
4,A family classic.,"This is a good movie for preteens and /or a good movie to sit and enjoy with your children. I liked the story line, the visual effects and the sometimes corny humor."
3,good old movie,"Good old movie for the kids and the family. Received the DVD quickly, but it was scratched and caused one scene to skip. I did not bother to contact the seller, so I am not sure if the seller would offer a replacement."
2,"Once again, Widescreen only good enough for region 2!!",Disney needs to stop giving the foreign market a better deal. Start concentrating on making the product more appealing domestically in the country where it was made! Widescreen somehow always gets put on the back burner for the US.
3,review honey shrunk kids,nice family movie...fun spirited..good character development...unrealistic drown/rescue scene--teen girl near drowns in muddy water--teen boy does rescue dives searching for her--he finds her pulls her out and does a few rounds of mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and she is perfectly fine and completely recovers
1,"The Movie kept cutting out and ""loading""","The movie is a great movie as I saw it when it first came out, but playing it for my kids through Amazon was horrible. I started and restarted more than I got to watch it. I tried other shows and movies after getting so frustrated with this download and they were all fine, so it was not my connection speed!"
5,Funny...,"Just as funny as I remember it being as a kid. My six year old loved this movie. Just ""rented"" it for a day, but thinking I may now need to buy it."
1,Not compatible to USA DVD player.,I love this movie but It will not work in my DVD player. It says it's not compatible with USA DVD player.
3,Suddenly the world just got a whole lot bigger.....,"Honey, I Shrunk The Kids doesn't exactly hold up, but it's still pretty fun. The special effects, which are the strongest elements in the film, are stunning to watch and they really help with the story (which is pretty weak at times). There are plenty of silly moments and some impressive sets and effects shots. The music is also good. However, there are two problems I have with this movie. One is that the kid characters are terribly dull. They was nothing distinctive or interesting about them. The other flaw I find in this movie is that the journeys that the kids take when they're tiny aren't very adventurous. I mean, the adventures aren't very imaginative. It's not really exciting to see this kids wandering around in the grass. It would have been better if they had taken a journey outside of the neighborhood.Still, HISTK is fun, and it has some swell special effects. It's not a great movie, but it certainly isn't a bad one, either.Grade: 5/10"
1,COLLECTORS BEWARE,"This DVD presents the film in full frame, not widescreen. Why Disney did not include a widescreen transfer on the other side of the disc or as a separate release is beyond my reasoning capabilities. I had to return mine unopened once I realized this. Same for HONEY, I BLEW UP THE KID."
2,C'mon Disney!... Why are you anti-original aspect ratio?!,"I had waited for quite some time for this film as well as Jungle 2 Jungle, Babes In Toyland, and White Fang to be released on DVD. I was only to be disapponted by Disney that it's awaited release was only available in the full-frame/pan and scan version. A benefit of owning a DVD player is the ability to own films widescreen and with extras (which these DVDs lack). If we are turning into a digital society... then make it worth our while. Disney's choice of the aspect ratio 1:33:1 release has cheated these films' directors in that the widescreen anamorphic format is how the director intended us to see it. Disney cheated us, the audience, as well leaving us with a full screen of plot rather than the wonderful vision of the films' crew.P.S. Hey Disney give us a reason to buy your DVD's"
3,"Fun movie, bad DVD","Although it's a bit dated, Honey I Shrunk the Kids is still a fun family movie.However, I'm disappointed with the DVD edition. First, the video is ""fullscreen"" 4:3. There is no widescreen option for newer 16:9 displays. Second, the video quality is poor - you can see many video artifacts such as noise on the display. It looks like you're watching a VHS videotape.Your kids probably won't care about the picture quality, but it might bug the parents if you're watching along."
4,Kids love it,Bought this classic for my kids to watch on long car rides. I enjoyed this movie when I was younger and now my kids enjoy it.
3,"Great movie for the kids, poor audio quality...","Not sure if the audio problem came from streaming the movie on the internet through Amazon, but it was a huge bummer. It would get really loud during action parts and when dialogue came up, it was barely audible.This movie is fun for the whole family, it has some incredible special effects that for that time were stunners, just know that kids nowadays have seen better cinematographic advances so they might think its cheesy. Anyhow, my kids loved the movie, its funny, quirky, perfect for family night."
5,Stroll down memory lane,It was so fun to watch a childhood favorite of mine with my own children!! The quality was great and my kids loved it!!
4,classic 80's,"This is a classic. It is a cheesy film, but the kids really got a kick out of it. I would watch it again. Still makes me laugh at my age...37"
3,Entertaining Movie,We were bummed by how rude and disrespectful the kids were. But the premise is super fun for kids to watch play out.
1,Tried 3 different ones............all junk,"1st two I thought might be defective, but when the third one does the exact same thing, well you know its just poor workmanship. If you look at the coils in side only one side of all 4 slices gets hot, toast is VERY uneven and only toasts one side!"
1,Defective.,"After eagerly awating this toaster, I opened it up, pushed down the toast levers to test it, and found it was defective.There are four toast slots, thus eight sides which have heating elements. Of these eight sides, only two of the sides heated up completely and turned orange. Two other sides barely heated up, and the rest didn't heat up at all.I called the DeLonghi service center and described the problem. They said the toaster was defective and had to be returned.Apparently DeLonghi doesn't test these things before they ship them."
2,DeLonghi Toaster,Nice looking but doesnt toast according to the settings. I have to stop for the desired toasting. Wouldn't reccomend it.
3,Abridged version of a fantastic course,"Frank is a great teacher and his courses are excellent. This one is no exception. One word of warning. This is NOT the complete Inversion Excursion course. Go onto the Truefire site to get the complete course.The DVD being offered here is their Abridged Course which only covers major chord inversions. This includes major triads, major 6, major 7 and major 9 chords only. The complete series covers all the minor chord variations, dominants and b9, #9, etc. It also covers vertical movement, I IV V progressions and Cycle of 4ths. I agree with everything that the previous reviewer (R. Holcomb) has said, but understand that you are only purchasing roughly 25% of the entire course."
2,"Not the best, you get what you pay for..","I've used this for a little more than 2 years now. And up until now, it was working fine. Now, the blinking light stays blinking, constantly trying to heat up, but not. I'm sad because I just missed the warranty. And I'm just writing a review now, because I was trying to find a fix for the thing.I've starred it down to 2 stars because this isn't that great of straightener in general.Pro: When its working, it heats up pretty quickly. I usually need the highest setting, and this one was pretty decent.Cons: Bulky size.Part where you're suppose to hold onto and place your fingers gets really hot and unbearable to hold on.The same parts to hold on to is uncomfortable regardless of heat, the ridges start to wear your fingers out.There is a weird guide in the middle of the straightener, to keep the two paddles aligned. But this gets caught on your hair easily, and when it does it hurts!"
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed getting this product because I've read the previous reviews and the majority have written positive feedback on this hair iron. I actually prefer the cheaper Conair's ceremanic irons w/o the wet on/off feature over this one. It doesn't clamp down well on my hair (I've got thick frizzy hair). The results for me aren't that great, it straightens my hair a little but it's still frizzy. It's lightweight which is nice. I don't care for the wet hair option because it takes me twice as long to straighten my hair. I definitely prefer other models over this one."
3,It works good if you have time,"As some previous reviews mentioned, you must move slowly on your hair inch to inch, it works quite well. But every morning I'm so rush to work, so the result is not completely perfect looking - the end of my hair is still little frizzy. All I can say, I can do better at weekends when I have more time to deal with my hair and stuffs. One more con is too bulky."
1,Broke After One Year,"I bought this product for my wife, who occasionally straightens her hair, even though she already has naturally straight hair. The product was maintained in nearly pristine condition, and at the time of this review, it still looks so well cared for I could practically return it as new in the box (had I kept the box). Anyways, after EXACTLY on year, the product just stopped heating. The lights turn on but the heating never begins. What I find fascinating is that I'm not the only person this has happened to. If you read through the low-rated reviews of this product, several other customers have complained about this. I do not recommend this product."
1,Sudden death,I LOVVVVVVVE this straightener but I am now on my second one as the heating element keeps burning out :( I wrote to the Conair customer service folks and am waiting to hear back. Hopefully they will replace it!
1,In Pain and Still Frizzy,"I've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight. This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out. Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass. Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener. Needless to say, I'll be taking this back for an exchange.I suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair."
1,not very good,"My hair is curly, but not difficult to straighten. The wet setting button does not provide enough heat to dry and straighten my hair. The dry set button does not provide enough heat either. The pins don't do much to help pull the hair straight. The result was frizzy, course, partly straight hair, it took a long time, and I got so hot during the process that I'm sure it frizzed my hair more. Also, the vents are on the side, which made it easy to burn myself from the steam. Probably best for lightly wavy, thin caucasion type hair. Everyone else, spend the extra money for the Maxi-Glide. Does a much better job and is easy to use."
3,Would probably work better if you didn't have Wavy or Curly Hair.,I bought this straightner while on vacation. The first time I used it I had a friend straighten my hair. I didn't really notice until after the Second try when I tried to do my own hair that the straightening pins on the plates pull at your hair. It was a pain and I finally just gave up because it hurt so much. Other than that it would have been a wonderful straightner.
2,Not too pleased,I read all the reviews & thought this would do the trick. My daughter does not like the results at all. It does not straighted her hair as it states. I wish I would have spent a little more $$ on a better one.
3,Not for thick AfrAmer hair,"My hair is very thick and this straightener could not handle it. It seems like it would be fine ofr other types of hair but if you are black or just have hair that takes a lot of effort to straighten, I would not recommend this straightener."
1,It sucks,"This Freaking sucks!! it does not heat well at all and it leaves my hair puffy and not straight at all. I have really think curly hair and it did not work for me, I don't recommend it. I thought it would actually work cause of all the 5 stars of ratings it had and people saying great stuff about it. Even my sister didn't like it and she has thin some what straight hair and for her it takes longer to straighten. Maybe I got a defected one or who knows, but I personally don't recommend it."
5,Awesome!,I must say I have bought every flat iron out there and this is the only one that really gets my hair super straight with no frizz or fly aways! I was told that chi was the best and I was unhappy with it but this conair is cheap but yet does the job I've always wanted from a flat iron. My hair is thick and frizzy and course but after I'm done using this iron you would never know! And it holds the whole day! I wish I could stock pile this iron so I could always know my hair would look fabulous! Worth it and love it!
5,Great Ceramic Straighten,Happy wife Happy life!I picked up 2 of these for my wife and she loves them. She has curly hair and this model was the only one that had a good built in brush to get out the tangles.Would buy again!
4,Hold it right in your hand,"I had this one before and I think it was a little bit better, now it doesn't have the tiny thing in the plates which use to hold your hair better, I'm even thinking on changing the plates from the old one to the new one, but I like the shape that allows you to give the hair the form you want and overall I am happy with it."
2,"Works fine, but when it dies there is no warning.","I have also gone through three of these. I like them, and they are cheap so I kept buying the same one. Until today when the third died. It worked great yesterday, and then like the others try to heat it up this morning, and nothing. When it goes it goes, with no warning. Bought another model today. If used every day, they have all lasted me for a year, maybe a year and a half. But now I would rather spend the money on one that will last."
5,Good for 1 year,"This is my all time favorite hair product. It works the best, gets hot enough to straighten my thick hair, and the middle comb helps immensely (trust me, once you use a straightener with a built in comb, you cannot go back to using a straighener without combs). I have had three so far, because they only last ONE YEAR. FYI. But they do come with a 2-year warranty I believe, so if I wasnt so lazy I could probably get one for free.Enjoy!!!"
3,A little heavy,"I felt it was a little heavy and the pins pulled at my hair. I have shoulder lenght hair, maybe it would work better with longer hair."
3,It was good at first,"I've had this for about a year and it worked pretty good, not the best straightening ever though. It took about 40 minutes to get it perfectly straight, I have curly frizzy hair. About 2 months ago it started acting weird. After i use it for about 5 minutes it would turn itself off so i have to turn it back on and wait for it to heat every few minutes. Sometimes it doesn't even turn on, I have to unplug it and wait like 10 minutes, then plug it back in and wait for it to heat. Oh, it also takes almost 5 minutes to heat up, unlike some newer irons."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this about a week or two ago. I liked it for the most part when I got it, but today it broke. I used it maybe 5 times total. I did not drop it. The product will not turn on at all. I would spend your money on another product as I'm learning many people have experienced this."
3,Pulled my hair out!,"This was my first straightener. It did damage my hair, there are places hairs can get caught and break. I later bought a Remington and it is such an improvement over the Conair! My hair has never been this straight and I don't have to worry about breakage. I don't recommend buying this."
3,Can't beat the price..,"So I bought this on Tuesday. It had great shipping got here in 3 days and I used the free shipping. I was hoping it was going to be as good as a different conair one that I used that has a steam dish in it.. it's not. So I will have to buy that one later on tooPros: Does add really great shine, locks in the moisture of your hair, takes half the time than my Amika straightener, price, and shippingCons: It tugs a lot on dry thick hair, it's a little bulky, has a weird smell, had some odd sticky stuff on it when I pulled it out of the packageAll in all, I spend 20 bucks on it plus shipping... I figure I'll just use it when I have wet hair, and I should be okay. Will be buying a different straightener in a few months though, cause this one won't work for my wedding. Still a great buy if you have thin or average hair."
4,good performance,"its a good product for the price, have work since day 1 perfect, so yes! buy it!m the color its great and about size its 4x4"
4,Decent straightener for the price,"I've had this straightener for over a year now and have not experienced any of the glitches or malfunctions that others have complained of. The straightener itself is a bit bulky and weighty, and the hinge squeaks every time you close it. It does a pretty good job on straightening my thick, wavy hair and it only takes me about 20 minutes on dry hair. I have not used it on fully wet hair [just slightly damp], but I do not notice a difference in how the straightener performs. For the price, it's not bad at all and worth a shot."
2,too bad,"I cant get through the book. Compared to fixer chao is just terrible, I am SO disappointed. I read the first 3 chapters and had no idea whats going on. I guess like everyone else in hollywood, success has spoiled this artist who I was once obsessed with after reading Fixer Chao. Moral of the story: Just because they come out with one good book doesn't mean you should run out and buy their next book. Han Ong, what were you thinking? Stylistically its out of control, you used to be so candid and honest and straightforward, now your words only confuse and depress me. I just cant recommend this book although Fixer Chao was the best book I read in 10 years, hands down."
4,Targus,"I liked the product, it's just that we had a hard clamshell case, and we thought this would be similar. It's nice it is just not a hard shell case. Still it is a good buy."
1,too heavy and not enough space inside,"The title says it all. This bookbag seems like it should have a lot of space inside but it doesn't and it's unnecessarily too heavy. Don't expect these rolling type of bookbags to be light as a feather, but it was too much. The jansport was more roomy I got for my second child and it wasn't too heavy."
3,Too many zippers and pockets.,"I noticed right away that this bag had a lot of pockets to put things in. Also, with all the pockets, a lot of zippers. It seems to be a pain to go through two levels of zippers to get to something. From the outside, the bag is quite busy with 5 zippered enclosures (more zippers on the inside).The laptop sleeve does its job well. I can easily pack my laptop and a few books in the roomy bag. However, as the bag gets half full, you begin to realize how thin the shoulder straps are. It hardly gives any padding at all.Not a bad buy, but not a great one either."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","I moved from a Lucas backpack to this one. There are many things I like about this one: it rolls very nicely, the padded handle is nice when I need to lift it, straps are good, and construction appears to be good. However, I have many accessories, so I need more and larger pockets (as a previous reviewer noted, the top front pocket could be larger), and an additional separator in the computer section would be useful. Also, I don't like the strings used to pull the zippers. And the straps don't fold down flush when packed away to roll the bag along. When fully loaded, the backpack does not easily fit under the seat in front - I either have to put it overhead or slide it under the seat pushing the top side in first."
5,Targus is a Hit,"This product was easy to purchase because the information was readily available. I bought this for my techie daughter who travels for her job. She was killing her back and shoulders carrying her laptop and tools to each job, but now she can just wheel everything to each location. She LOVES IT and I'm so happy to have come up with something to help her avoid wrenched back muscles. By the way, it really does fit under an airline seat. Perfect!"
5,Great little case,"Sorry to say that I never really got to use it. I have the 11.6"" Gateway netbook and because of the battery extending the extra inch out the back it just wasn't quite gonna fit(damn!) I just gave it to someone who had a 10"" netbook and they love it. I think the Acer 11.6"" would fit as long as the battery dont protrude from the rear."
4,"Good, Comfortable, and roomy","bought the backpack to replace a messenger style bag that hurt my shoulders. The Targus holds my Dell Precision with extended battery well. it is really roomy, with tons of compartments.I knocked it down a point because it has TOO many compartments that all look alike, and therefore, has a lot of zippers and tags. Not a problem, but you may end up hunting for something."
3,Heavy even without books,"I bought this rolling backpack for those times when my shoulders just can't take the load anymore. It works well as a rolling bag, but is a heavy bag, even before computers and books go in. The transition from shoulder to roller is a little awkward, as you have to take it off, stop, bend over and make sure both shoulder straps are well tucked in and out of the way; then proceed. The roller does work well, no tilting or tipping over, and it has been a durable bag. Just wish they could find a way to lighten it (or maybe the book!? Kindle?) up a bit."
5,Great item,"This is a great case for a 12 inch netbook such as the asus 1201n. At first it seems too small but actually the bag is designed to fit snug but still open enough so that the power outlet and maybe a wireless mouse can fit in the side compartment. The shoulder strap is really comfortable and has a lot of cushion. This case is advertised for 12 inch netbooks but there is an alternative compartment for smaller 10 inch ones as well. Overall great product, I recommend this item,it fits great for my 12 inch netbook and this size of sleeve is hard to find in most stores like staples, target, officemax, or k-mart who only sell 10 inch size sleeves."
4,Great wheeled laptop backpack,"I bought this mainly because I travel a lot with my laptop and walking form terminal to terminal at airports gets to be bit much lugging around all the weight. This backup does the job perfectly. It's pretty big as well. It stored my 15"" laptop plus a bunch of other things nicely. It has a flap that can be flipped if you are using the shoulder straps so you don't ruin your clothes with the dirt on the wheels.The one downside to this is that it is a little heavy. Since it has wheels and it rolls, this is not a big deal to me, but if you plan on carrying it a lot, this could be a problem."
3,Its a bookbag with a laptop sleeve,"The backpack itself does not have a dedicated laptop pocket. Instead, the cushioning comes from the sleeve provided with the backpack. Didn't realize this when I bought the bag."
3,A little too heavy,"This bag is great and I was really excited to get it... however, it is a little too heavy for use as a conventional backpack.... and in the end, you WILL have to pick it up a LOT as you come across stairs or other surfaces where you can't just roll your way through..... Although I do recomend it, I have to point out that this is quite a heavy bag."
3,Very Good,Works well. Front stabilizer need to be more sturdy... at times it falls over if you have too much in it.
4,Great Commuter Backpack for Professionals,"I ordered this backpack after reading reviews posted at Amazon. The backpack was listed locally for well over $90, so this was a good purchase for me.There is a sufficient amount of room in the back (larger) space for your computer, and a padded jacket, too. The wheels roll smoothly, and the straps are wide and well padded. I was looking for a comfortable, functional pack for my day commutes in Seattle, and this is perfect for that.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because if have an item that is wide, it will not fit because of the dividers between the book area and the computer area. Other than that, this is a fine purchase."
3,"Noisy on the wheel, but good quality","I have used the TagusTargus TSB700 15.4 Rolling Notebook Backpackfor 1 month in my last travel. The bag has a good design and is well built. It is extremely easy to put it into and taken out of the plane's overhead cabin because of the two wheels, for small plane, it can be stored under the seat. The two shoulder straps are wide, so it is comfortable.My only and biggest complain is the wheels are not noisy but very noisy rolling on hard ground. It make me feel very embarrassed to roll it, or I have to walk very slowly. I think the reason is the material of the wheel maybe too hard. I may return it."
4,pretty good bag,"I looked at every rolling backpack in every store, and at a ton of websites. I finally decided on this one. It is very sturdily made and has wheeled around just fine. My computer is quite well-protected from bumps and knocks. The negatives: it doesn't fit under an airline seat - has to go in the overhead. It is kind of smaller than it appears. I am in medical school, and it really only holds the computer and about two books. That's enough for me, but it might not be for some folks. All in all, I would recommend it just because it is really well-made and I am not concerned that it will fall apart, burst a seam, refuse to telescope (the handle!), break a zipper, etc."
4,Great and useful product but awful sound !!,"I travel frequently for business and I was always searching for a notebook bag that looks like a casual bag especially to prevent the theft. I actually loved the way Targus bag looks and it provides useful space for my notebook and clothes (not more than 1-2 day travel) BUT it makes an awful sound on the surface of autowalks at the airports or even on some of the sidewalks....Everyone know I'm coming !!!!! So, I'm even thinking about changing the tyres ?? If thats actually possible ?"
5,Targus backpack review,I use this bag every day for work and love it. It has plenty of room for evrything I need to carry without back or shoulder strain.
1,TERRIBLE design for carrying laptops,"I was excited at how lightweight this bag was and thought I would just love it. However, I quickly found that this bag is poorly designed for carrying laptops (full sized weight) or anything tall and heavy. It is designed to lean at an angle that causes it to fall backwards ALL (I mean multiple times per day) the time when there is anything heavy such as a laptop in it. I am surprised that my laptop has not yet met its death due to this bag falling over. I now have to remember to prop the bag against a wall or desk to keep it from falling over and damaging my laptop. This bag would have had potential if they had not designed it with such a diagonal lean and nothing at the bottom to balance the weight. Very disappointed!"
1,Failed Targus Packpack,"Zipper failed on first trip. Too small for 15"" laptop. Poor quality. Back pak straps suitable for small person or child, too short for adult and padding does not extend far enough for comfortable carry."
3,OK for price,"So far it seems to be durable and of decent quality, but like another reviewer, the one I received had this craptastic flimsy shoulder strap that seems to be an awkward length (for me at least.) I will be addressing this situation w/ Targus.Other than that, my only real complaint is that the interior straps that hold the top part up (so you can use your netbook while still in the case) have these bulky plastic buckles that have scratched the exterior of my Mini. I don't really see their overall purpose and actually cut the straps off completely.The accessory pouch is adequate sized, but barely so. Not much more could be done though w/o sacrificing the compactness of the case.Overall it's a decent case for the money."
2,Feels Cheap,"I have owned many Targus products and this is the first one I thought was below their typical standard. I'm looking for a new laptop backpack with wheels. When it arrived, I opened the package and looked the backpack over. As I touched it, it just felt cheap. If you're thinking about this backpack, look at another.While it's got great pockets and a good configuration, it looks and feels cheap."
5,great little bag,"This bag looks good and has plenty of room for my netbook, power cord and mouse and still has room for pencils and a small notebook (paper). I love it!"
4,Decent Netbook case,"The Targus Sport Netbook Case is a decent carrying case for my Asus Netook. It will adequately shield my netbook from falls of moderate height. The fit is just about optimum leaving plenty of room in the other zippered compartment for odds and ends one might need or want to carry along, such as a power supply, or USB patch cables. I even stow a hardbound book in mine from time to time. The only things I don't absolutely love about the case are the strap that keeps the case from opening too wide (it tends to flop outside of the case, getting in the way when zipping up that compartment), and I would far prefer that the case was solid black. While the the strap is a minor annoyance, I would say that it should not be counted as a disqualifying quality. All in all this is the case to buy for a 10.1 inch netbook, and despite the two minor negative observations, I could comfortably recommend this case to anyone with a similarly sized netbook. It's right for the job."
5,great bag,"This bag is durable. It's actually spacious, since my son has a lot of stuffs that he needs to bring everyday. Now he does not have back pain because of the rollers."
4,Targus Netbook bag,Its works well for my netbook with extra space for a small notebook and some pens etc. I'm very satisfied.
4,A lot of space!!,"I needed a new bag for work and after searching for quite a while this seems to fit my requirements. I needed a bag that rolls, I can sling over my shoulder as needed and has lots of space. Lots of pockets would be nice too!! This bag fills all those requirements.Pros:+ I like the T handle and the large rollerblade style wheels that glide very smoothly.+ Lots of storage capacity.+ Many zippered pockets to sort everything I carry (3 ring binders, overnight essentials, earplugs, keys, work gloves, etc). You get the idea)+ Backpack straps that hide under a flap when not used.Cons:- Backpack straps feel a bit thin. They haven't broke yet but I fear they might. As I want this to last I try not to use them much.- There is a small net pouch on the side (water bottle?) with a drawstring that already broke from the side today.Overall this seems to be a good bag, I would definitely recommend it for school use or typical business travel."
5,Does a good job,"I bought this so I could travel with one bag to hold all, while being able to keep my notepad safe. Quite simply, it got the job done. Decent quality too, considering the low price tag."
5,Nice bag,"I looked all over for a bag for my netbook and finally found this one! This bag is perfect for your netbook. I carry my Acer one, mouse and slim line dvd drive in this bag and still have room for many small items. Tough, small and durable. Only thing that I don't really care for was the little pull string knob inside that allows you to tighten the computer into the case. You get good protection for your computer in a very nice case, I have two of these and would order these again. Amazon as always did a great job!"
5,great for the price,"bought it for my netbook; only minus is that its zippers only go one way, wish it had two zippers instead of one, but what else do you want for $20?"
4,Very good purchase,"I picked up this backpack for my work laptop, a 15.4"" HP EliteBook. This is everything I wanted beyond something to tote my laptop around. It's not too 'chunky' or huge, there is plenty of space for notebooks and binders, and MP3 players et al. Worth the money."
5,Excellent! Bought it twice!,"I bought this item the first time around 2005 when I bought a laptop for college. I have used it since then to carry my laptop most everywhere. I also used the item as my backpack throughout all of college. It only recently sprung a hole in the bag making it no longer a bag I want to put anything in without losing it!! I was absolutely delighted to see that they still make the same exact bag and without question bought it again!!! Love that the laptop case comes out and isn't attached. The straps are durable and comfortable. It is a good durable bag, looking forward to many more years of use!"
5,Excellent buy,"I bought this rolling backpack in April and have since taken it on several trips, mostly involving transatlantic flights, airport transits, trains and buses, and I absolutely love it. I typically also have a big suitcase for part of the trip and love that I can use the Targus as a backpack, for instance when getting in and out of trains, but when I have checked my suitcase I can fold away the handles and roll it. Either way it is very comfortable. The only thing I would improve would be to add a different kind of outside pocket or perhaps straps to secure magazines or boarding passes or a small umbrella within easy reach quickly. (Apart from the pockets you see on the picture, it has one side net pocket for a small water bottle and a slightly too small other side pocket with a zipper) Overall, one of my best purchases ever, great value for money and exactly what I was looking for."
1,"Great Bag, Terrible Zippers","I bought this bag for the new 2011 15"" MBP. It fit my needs perfectly. Big enough for the MBP and my notebooks and book for class. It was great until 3 days ago. The zipper began getting stuck. At first I thought it was the zipper getting stuck with the fabric, like all other zippers do. Upon inspection, I found that the zipper tracks have quite big gaps and now the actual zipper has came off the track and is now useless. I can only close the biggest bag in one direction now. It sucks that I can't return this or get an exchange as my 30 days expired a few days ago. It was a great product, while it lasted. I'm not too happy with this purchase as it's only a little over a month old and the zipper has already failed."
5,Notebook case worth the money,"a great value. provides good protection in a padded case. Not a a lot of extra room, but perfect for those who just want a case for their notbook, mouse, and an external DVD drive."
4,Practical as a business case,"I switched from a wheeled breif case to this. I use it everyday to and from work as a wheeled case. It doesn't look as need as a breif case, but today noone cares. The big advantage is when traveling I can switch it to backpack and have my hands free. It als rolls down the isle of an airplane without hitting the seats.Ofter a month including two business trips is shows no wear. Mine is all black with black and gray strings tied on the zippers. I removed about half of the zipper ties since they aren't need."
4,"Great Rolling Bag, but a bit bulky as a backpack","I really like this as a rolling bag, but it is a bit bulky as a backpack. It has very sturdy construction, doesn't tip over easily and keeps your laptop protected with very good padding. There is also room to store everything. I would definitely buy this if you are looking for a rolling bag that can also be a backpack. If you are looking for a backpack primarily, then this might not be the bag for you."
3,"Beware differences in 15"" Bags","I've ordered the wheeled bag before for my daughter for school. It was relatively light for a wheeled bag and has worked well for her. I went to order another one for my younger daughter and ordered the other 15"" bag thinking it was just a different color. One bag has wheels and one is just a backpack. I dont think Amazon should have them both on the same page."
1,"The design is good, but the quality is too bad.","I bought it for school just around 3 months, and it's broken now. The bottom of the backpack is very weak. You can't fill much is things in your backpack although it has a huge storage space. The bottom can't afford too much things..."
5,Don't Buy Anything Else,"My Business Partners love this product. There are some they order, the wheels fall off and don't protect against inclimate weather. This does it all. More compartments to carry stuff other than your laptop and accessories."
3,Good rolling backpack,"That backpack is a very hight quality product as Targus is used to do.First time I used it, I noticed that the shoulder straps have to be attached while rolling as they will go around the wheels.So impossible to move directly from the back position to rolling. You need first to re-attached the shoulder straps.Targus should find a solution to switch between the back and rolling mode without any operation."
2,Not for Business Travel,"This rolling notebook case is well constructed with a lot of room. For me, this bag has not worked well however. I travel often and need a laptop bag that will attach to my other luggage. There is no 'easy' way to attach this laptop bag to my other luggage - so it has turned into quite a nusance to travel with."
2,Report From Iron Mountain,"This was a leaked document from a secret government funded think tank study group that many say is a hoax. Personally I think its probably for real. Various foundation/government think tanks have been caught saying and doing things just as bad, if not worse, than whats in The Report From Iron Mountain so I don't see why this would be unbelievable to anyone with half a clue as to how the world really operates. As far as reading it, well its horribly boring. You can get overviews in various ""conspiracy"" related books so I don't know if this is necessary reading."
1,Be Cautious,We had Summers' textbook for 1st year Greek and I worked my way through this companion study guide on my own. I found it to be of little value because there are dozens of mistakes! I contacted B&H to let them know and was given the runaround. This book is NOT a good study aid until/unless B&H corrects the errors.
1,Don't bother!,"This DVD spends way too much time on footage of Stotts and windshield views of city streets, rather than the subject matter. The delivery is stale and definitely over the heads of 5th-8th graders. All in all, the subject matter is not presented well and the camera angles are terrible."
4,Viewmaster reels + viewer,"The images on the View-Master reels are great, and we are very pleased with the reels. However, the description of the item says ""View-Master reels + viewer"", but there isn't anything included that could be called a ""viewer"". I thought it meant that there would be something that you could ""view"" the reels with, but all you get are the reels."
2,For the hardcore Seinfeld viewer...,"Since there is no description of this DVD on the site, here it is. This was a bonus disc that was given out as a Best Buy promotion when you bought one of the volumes 1 and 2 or 3. The DVD simply contains additional interviews from cast members that play George and Jerry's parents, Newman, Puddy, Uncle Leo and more. The DVD is entitled, ""Life Before Seinfeld"".It isn't a bad DVD if you are interested in watching the interviews; however, if you don't own it now then you aren't missing much."
2,Woulda been nice...,"Shoulda been nice. It worked fine for a couple of uses, but one morning as I was tightening up the jar on its base, it just broke off in my hand. Now I wasn't cranking this thing, just normal tightening - nothing more than what I'd done with the factory original (lost in a fight with gravity & physics) that this was supposed to replace. Unfortunately, I can't say that I'd recommend that you order this particular jar should you feel the need."
4,An excellent rendering of Narayan'slife and times,"This is vintage Narayan at his best. Those of us who are his regular readers, will continue to marvel at his breezy, uncomplicated style of narration. My Days will make you smile, shed a tear and feel sorry when it ends ! A must for all book-lovers."
3,The Seventies: From Hot Pants to Hot Tubs,"My overall review of this book was really good. Although, it would probably be most enjoyable to people who lived in and remember the seventies. The book was funny to read because it covers music, films, politics, trends, and television. You can also follow along through the seventies at the bottom of each book page with a timeline marking historical events during the seventies. So if you want an educational yet fun way to learn about the seventies this book would be a good choice."
2,Freeze,"I have had this player for a few weeks and sometimes it works fine and other times it will freeze for no reason in the middle of playback. I plan to return it for a different brand because this is unacceptable for the amount of money it costs. Also, the user interface for MP3 playback is very primitive as compared to most other MP3 compatible DVD players."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER. PERIOD.,This is a warning to all of those people who are interest in this Sharp dvd player. I purchase one of this dvd player and it would not work. The problem is that this dvd player only skips and freezes even when it is on the first movie. I exchange it for the second version. Same problem. I exchange it for the third version. Same thing. It only skips and freezes after only playing it for an hour... 95% of Sharp DV740U dvd players need to be refund or exchange. So my advice to you is to not to purchase this dvd player. I just wrote a letter to Sharp Corporation to explain that Sharp should stop selling it to retail store or online until the problem is solve.Other than that this dvd player has cool styling and features for an exceptionally low price.
1,BAD BAD BAD,I had problems with mine almost from day one it has never worked right and I only wish I'd returned it while I had the chance. Someone earlier tried to imply that it was poor disc quality. But I've bought brand new discs unwrapped them popped them in and had them not play through. Then take the same disc into the other room and put it in a $50.00 Oritron Player and had it play PERFECTLY... These machines might well serve better as a doorstop than as a DVD Player.
1,Untrustable,This DVD player is not worth the money! Please do not expect a good DVD player. This player not only stalls about an hour into the movie. It ALSO has a problem with brightness. Throughout the film. Everything 30 seconds the movie goes from BRIGHT to DARK!
1,Peice of junk don't waste your money!,"I have nothing good to say about this dvd player. Sharp should be ashamed of this product. The freezing problem drives me crazy. All of these units should be pulled from shelves. If you have one already return it, if you don't have one yet don't buy one. Period."
1,freezing picture,Same problem as everyone else picture starts freezing half way through the movie and gets worse as you get towards the end of the movie.
1,Faulty Machine,"Hey to all you out there that has prob's with the dv740u. I concure also that the machine has some bad problems, But if you contact the sharp help line they will help you out. After having the machine into the shop for three times and finally having the traverse deck replaced. I finally called sharp they told me they would send me another upgraded one to replace this unit. Should be getting it in 10 day's.Ps. can any-one tell me if they have had any experience with the sharp modle DVS2U."
3,A Contrary Opinion...,"I found this player to be quite good, especially at playing alternate media. I've not suffered the same maladies as the other people posting while playing factory DVDs, but I use this machine in the bedroom as a secondary unit. For a low cost DVD player, you could certainly do a lot worse."
1,Skipping problem,"I concur with the previous reviewer: the skipping, even on an immaculated DVD, is unacceptable."
1,Stutters,"I recently received this DVD player as A gift. It was my first player, and it almost made me think this whole DVD thing was a scam! Do all DVD players act like this? Fortunatly I have found out that they do not. No matter what movie I put in the player freezes and stutters after about an hour into it. It's enough to drive you crazy. After talking to some knowledgable people, and doing some research, I have found that this is a common problem with this player. It's to bad, the player has some very nice features, but they are worthless if the player doesn't perform it's basic function...PLAYING A DVD...without stuttering and freezing up. I will definatly be returning it for another brand. ..."
3,Big picture lost in the details,"V&V does a great job on details, however, it sadly misses the big picture. The meta and intuitive material is indeed there, but so buried as to be nearly useless. The reader has difficulty reconstructing a coherent whole.To profit from V&V, you need either an unusually good prof, or a companion book such as Lehninger, Mathews, or Stryer. Read a chapter from the simpler text, then fill in the finer points with V&V. This learning model has worked very well for me."
3,Descent,"Shipping time was great and the book was in good condition overall. However, there was a large amount of highlighting that was not mentioned in the book description."
2,Pathetically inferior to Stryer,"As a high school junior wishing to major in biochem, I read the vaunted Voet/Voet book and must say it is extremely disappointing. Although decent enough, Stryer's Biochem is much more comprehendable. And to that reader from Sweden, biochem is NOT supposed to be more about chem than about bio. Furthermore, it would be stupid and arrogant for a student simply to learn about the chemistry of molecular biology and not the relevance to biological systems...Styer does a better job of linking all those uncomprehendable chemistry stuff into real-world biological examples..."
3,boring!...,"this is, like, the most boring book I've ever read. I totally liked the Harry Potter books and the Narnia books, too. But, this book... first of all, it makes no sense, and it's like it doesn't even try to be engaging and pull me into a world all my own, filled with fantasy and all that good stuff that really makes me fly. Got any ""snow""?"
1,Bad,Worst text ever. The order of the book is not very good and the language is hard to understand. Trying to figure out biochem with just this book will be a feat. If you dont have lecture good luck with this book. I took biochem and actually went to another text because this one was confusing.
4,Good book but sometimes disappointing.,"At some places The Book is frustratingly superficial, and Index is a disappointment at times. But clearly written, good illustrations, overall impression is good."
1,Worthless!,"I got these as a part of a gift from a friend and they worked well with regular use for the first 3 weeks. Then they started to smell so I hand washed them and put them to sun dry, that solved that problem. Then the outer fabric started to run and get holes and rust colored marks and they became very slack on my wrist and proved to be more of a hindrance than a work-out asset."
1,Odor,The weights are a little tight to get on. This poses areal problem if yu have arthritus. Also we keep most of our small exercise items in a basket. Lately we have detected an odor and we narrowed it down to the Weider weights. We removed the weights and the odor disappeared. I would definitely not purchase these again!
5,good pair of wrist weights,"These weights are convenient to use, since you just slip them on. There are no hooks or fasteners. I'm a woman, and I'm not that big, so they fit me well. I can wear them around the house if I want, which I do once in a while. I also use them to do some muscle toning exercise. They have to be washed once in a while, and they don't look like they can be put in the machine."
3,Great Clipboard...when you get one that works!,"I love the functions of this clipboard. I use it to hold my workout/exercise list while I'm at the gym. I get maximum efficiency because I can time exactly one minute between sets (exact amount required in my workouts for muscle recovery). The only problem is that the first one that I ordered quit working after a couple of weeks, the second one never worked out of the box, but the third is perfect. Luckily I ordered from a company that sent me two replacements for FREE, without even having to send back the faulty product! If you order this, do so under the condition that you can get another one if you get a crappy one!"
5,"Interesting subject, witty humor","Not a bad video! There are certainly some funny parts. I really enjoyed it! Possibly because I was a judge's gavel away from having to pay $1,050 for just a speeding ticket in ole' VA! Anyway, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!!"
4,Great Reading,"First off this is not a Travel Guide rather an amalgam of stories and excerpts from books. But a very useful counterpoint TO Travel Guides.It gives a real personal sense of some of the places in this part of France because i is not a Travel Guide. Having just spent a week in Biarritz I wish I could have read this before I had gone there.It is really quite insightful but really varied as well because the article are taken from a range of sources; food magazines, authors, travel critics. I found myself cross-referencing places mentioned in this book with a Michelin Red Guide and a map.It really is great reading"
2,Healing Sick Houses,Well-don't try this at home. That is the general feeling about this book. I guess after reading this book They must think that most of the general population are no-talents. In other words please check with your doctor before doing anything and make sure the doctor does it. Very disapointed in this book. It could have been presented a lot better than how good they are at what they do and you are not. Dowsing For Health was a much better and informantive read.
5,Great!,"Even though all songs are great, this album is worth buying for just one song i.e Dark Side of Aquarius. Buy it if you want to listen to beautiful lyics, a great voice and haunting music."
5,THE RETURN OF THE KING,RECENTLY I HEARD A BRUCE DICKINSON SONG CALLED THE RETURN OF THE KING.. I CANNOT FIND THIS SONG ANYWHERE. IF ANYONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT THIS SONG PLEASE TELL ME..
1,"Dull, tedious and uninspired","That applies to every track here. I've heard this album quite a few times over the years to give it a chance but this album never had a chance. Road to hell is such a boring chorus, I wonder what people are on to be overrating a dull track so much. Man of sorrows is another track that goes nowhere, it tries to be tuneful and emotional but fails and some people are apparently still impressed by it. I hear the sound of someone reaching for ideas but not getting anywhere.As for the rest of the album, when I say I have heard it a few times over close to a decade and just now and still can't remember the tuneless forgetable tunes, that explains this album in a nutshell. Bruce did a better job with Skunkworks. But overall I say, I'd skip his works and listen to the Blaze and Di'anno albums with Battlezone and Killers. Never mind what a handful of Bruce drones and Bruce era Maiden fanboys tell you."
5,Sew your socks on - one killer cd !!,"There's no bulls__t here. A hard rock masterpiece that doesn't happen very often. From the title song to Omega to Ghost of Cain to Star Children, you name it-they're all really good. If you like to rock real hard like I do, this is the one. Adrian Smith makes a huge difference - Bruce knew and it shows. Get this. If you know some one who likes to rock-buy it for them. Everybody should own it."
4,Bruce gets back to more basic rock,"The sound on ""Accident of Birth"" is good clean rock. I loved his sound with Iron Maiden but his new sound has less happening all at once as I.M. always does. If you like Bruce, you will like this album."
4,Bruce has a beautiful voice,"I am not a fan of metal by any stretch, but when my boyfriend played me ""Omega"" and ""The Ghost of Cain"" I was impressed. I had never thought of metal as being emotional or melodic. I have to say Mr. Dickinson gives this genre of music a good name."
5,Anne Stuart does it again!,"Leave it to Anne Stuart to twist this plot line around (and around)and make it work. Tackling a bit of time traveling in a shorter book is difficult at best, making it work as spendidly as she did is a rare feat indeed. Brava, Anne!As another reader mentioned, I only wished it were longer so I could have enjoyed my time in the (multiple <g>)lives of Susan and Jake that much longer. I can't wait to see what she does next!"
5,Wonderful with a twist!,This is not your ordinary romance novel. It was so unexpected and so much fun! I have yet to read a novel quite like this one. I highly recommend it to anyone that likes to read books with a twist and a lot of adventure. I could not put it down.
5,Mellow Listening,I had been talking with a friend about albums we used to have and enjoyed a great deal. When I got home I decided to go on line to Amazon to see is I could locate a Cd by Dexter Wanzell and much to my surprise I found it was there and reasonably priced. I ordered it immediately. I could not believe my luck. The Cd arrived in a timely manner and the cd was new as stated. I played it and it took me back to some beautiful memories. I will be looking for more albums in cd form in the future.Groovin in Chicago
4,Dexters Smooth Soul,"One Million Miles from the Ground. That track was the main reason for this purchase. Once upon a time,urban/college radio stations played this track with the idea that their audience could and would appreciate GOOD music. But alas, the times have taken us to the musical point of artist mediocracy offering us; Non-identifiable voices over re-hashed tunes from the not too distant past.This gathering of songs by Dexter and the gang was refreshing when releasted and can hold it's own to this day."
5,Need a Copy!!!!,"I have searched high & low for this Album, & I can't find it!!!I even went back home to Philly to try to get a copy..I ordered it through Borders & kept getting something else.. Needed it by Valentine's Day..If anyone knows how I can purchase ""Life on Mars""/What the World is Coming To, then please let me know..Thanks"
1,Doesn't work on all Fujis,this cable didn't fit my E500. Too bad there wasn't a list of cameras it does fit available.
1,Good for insomniacs only!,"This film is just bizarely horrendous. No one in this film can act, and the first 40 minutes are a better cure for a sleepless night than Ambian. When 6 year old Ron Howard gives the best performance in a film, you know you are in trouble. I love Johnny Cash, but if his estate has any concern about his reputation, they would find a way to preclude anyone from ever being able to see this thing again!"
1,total piece of crap,Why can't I give it 0 stars? Or negative stars?How did this piece of crap get made?!It's actually worse than I'm describing.
4,Cocktail,"Not one of his hardest acting roles, but still a fun entertaining watch and a good buy for a Cruise fan."
3,MST3K Fans Rejoice -- Rifftrax is Here!,"A drunken Australian councils a young Tom Cruise on life, love, and female undergarments. Tom and Nicole's wedding night? No, this is the thrilling plot of Cocktail, starring Cruise, Bryan Brown, Kelly Road House Lynch and Gina Showgirls Gershon. When young Brian Flanagan (Cruise) is discharged from the Army and quickly discovers that he has few job prospects, scant talent, and no discernible intelligence, he exercises his only real option and gets a job at a TGI Fridays, whipping around bottles of Blue Curacao and serving deep-fried broccoli balls to people wearing suspenders.When Coughlin betrays his partner, Brian flees to Jamaica, puts on a cheap, Qiana jungle print shirt and resumes his half-baked act there, soon bedding down the improbably named Jordan Mooney (Shue). Coughlin follows him to Jamaica. Can they rekindle their friendship? Will they reform their circus/bartender act? Will they get a job together tossing chicken strips around at a Carl's Jr.?"
1,A True Dud,Tom Cruise Can't Act to this day but he usually picks better films than this mess.it's one of those films that you would expect Michael J.Fox to take?it's a very 80's Cliche type of film.Avoid at all costs unless You Like The Smirks of Tom Cruise.Bryan Brown is a Good Actor but He made a Bad Choice Playing Second-Fiddle to Cruise in this film.
1,Somebody put something in this cocktail,"Not that Tom Cruise worries about my opinion, but by time he made COCKTAIL, I thought he was in a position to choose better films than this silly thing! Most Cruise pictures I've seen were at least an attempt at quality, and maybe the young actor thought COCKTAIL would be good, not just a good payday. Dunno. But I do know it almost put me to sleep, not unlike one too many of the drinks Cruise and Byran Brown served. Too bad the Brown-Cruise relationship, COCKTAIL's only interesting element, was not central to the story."
5,One of his best!!,"Granted, it's cheesy, but when you look beyond the simple story and thrown in plot twists, it's awesome!! To pick up your life, live and work in the sun and then fall in love with a beautiful woman you meet on an island - sounds like evry guy's dream, right? At least mine. I'll live vicariously through Tom, since it wouldn't work for me. This has always been an under-rated movie, but any red-blooded guy should be able to identify. Great acting thrown in for free!"
2,The arrogant bartender,"I don't know Tom Cruise personally, but the person he appears to be in tv interviews doesn't seem very different from the performance he delivers in almost every one of his movies.Early in his career, Mr. Cruise developed a cocky, in-your-face persona that he used in film after film.He played the cocky unlikable fighter pilot, the cocky unlikable bartender, the cocky unlikable NASCAR driver and the cocky unlikable pool hustler in movies that were limited by his character. Even in films that were saved by the superior performances of others - such as Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"", or Paul Newman in ""The Color of Money""- Tom still played the cocky unlikable character.With a handful of bizarre public appearances, he developed a nearly universal reputation, Sloane Crosley wrote in Village Voice, as ""one spoke behind Michael Jackson on the freak wheel.""This is his cocky bartender movie."
1,tom cruise lives up to razzie award winner status,"This is one of the worst acted and moronic story lines ever written. I might have enjoyed this movie had I been in junior high. Unfortunately, the first time around I was in high school. But who could ever forget those cleverly crafted one-liners, ""champangne, perfume going in... sewage coming out."" Say this the next time your at a bar-- watch your friends disappear."
1,One of the worst films ever made,Tom Cruise at his worst. Not even the lovely Elisabeth Shuecan save this movie. ...this film is a disaster. Bryan Brown should be ashamed of taking a part in this potboiler. What an awful plot. Don't buy it. Don't even see it.
5,COCKTAIL BLU RAY,GREAT MOVIE PERFECT SOUND AND PICTURE GREAT MUSIC GREAT STORY A PERSON FINDING OUT HOW TO BE SUCESSFUL IN LIFE THAT GOING TO SCHOOL ISNOT ALWAYS THE ROAD TO TRAVEL THAT PEOPLE GET OUT IN THE WORLD AND GET THE HARD NOSE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE YOU NEED EVEN IF YOU START IN THE MAILROOM OR A FILEING CLERK IN COLLEGE PEOPLE DONOT GET FIELD EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD SECURE THEM A JOB JUST A BILL FOR ATTENDING THE COLLEGE
4,Coming From A Batender......,"This movie was very entertaining in all ways! I actually learned a lot from this movie as a bartender! Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown worked extremely well together. Get this movie if you want to laugh, feel sad, and then feel good again."
4,the move wasn't bad,tom did a good job as a bartender but it shoudn't be a rated r because not enough nudety in it.
1,Perhaps the worst movie ever made,"I watched this movie on tv last night. I have to admit that everytime this is on, I have to watch it. Why, you ask? Because it is perhaps the worst movie ever made. It's like slowing down to see an accident on the side of the road. There are parts of this movie that will actually make you cringe, (the bar/poem scenes especially). Who would go to a bar run by these guys? With all the jumping and singing and bottle throwing, you'ld never get your drink! ""Coctails and Dreams""! That cracks me up, too! The story is paper thin and trots out just about every possible cliche. The dialog is completely unbelievable. The one up side is that parents can use this movie as a tool to insure that their kids will never pick up a drink or go to a bar. Just say ""NO""!"
5,"Sign yourself up for the ""Cruise"" of a lifetime!","Another Saturday evening with a nasty case of gas and a big bag of nobody next to me on the love seat. A night like any other, until...This all-you-can-eat eye buffet set up camp in my living room. Roll over Elisabeth Shue,Bahama Mama has licked her plate clean and she's back for seconds. Oh, and, uh, yoohoo, bartender, I'll have a marriage on the rocks. No, on second thought, why don't you hold the ice tonight, and serve me up a stiff one instead! Yeeeeeow!"
4,A Feel Good Movie....,"What a great film! Stars Tom Cruise and Bryan Brown. You keep a steady grin throughout the first half of the movie. From catching the bus to NYC, to going to class with young Flanagan, through looking for work on Wall Street, and then finally meeting Coughlin. Later, a 25-year old Shue appears. What a great young woman! She's smart, fun, good sense of humor, and of course, very pretty. Any guy would be lucky to meet her (Oh yeah, we find out later that she's an original ""rich chick"").You'll love the scenes of the old New York skyline and the beautifully breath-taking beaches of Jamaica, mon. A classic movie that everyone should watch and enjoy. Good songs and memorable quotes throughout as well."
3,O.K Movie,"Cocktail is not one the greatest movies out there. The plot here is sort of a mess especially at the beginning. I mean Tom Cruise had his big role at that time in Rain Man one the best movies ever made in my opinion but this movie Cocktail is just O.K. I think practically anyone could have been in that role of Tom Cruise and it would have not made a difference whether Micheal J. Fox, Patrick Swayze, or Bruce Willis big late 80's actors could have played that role of Tom Cruise and the movie still would have been a mess. The problem here is stupidity in the script Cocktail just centers around Tom Cruise juggling wine bottles and throwing glasses around. I mean in my opinion the movie gets better later on the beginning just gets on my nerves because it is so egotistical but it does get a little better there is some moral to the story at the end. This is just your typical mid 80's film."
1,One of the WORST movies ever!!,"This, by far is one of the worst movies EVER made. I don't even know why I bought it. It was stupid. That movie was over rated! Just horrible! I like Tom Cruise WAY better in ""Days of Thunder"", ""Risky Business"", his small ""Outsiders"" role, ""Rain Man"" and ""Top Gun"". I don't really like movies about bartenders and their romance. This movie fails, I give it a 0 and an F. Video Renters Beware! You will NOT like this movie! Have more fun watching glue dry."
5,The Best Tom Cruise Movie,"Tom Cruise stars as a small time want-to-be-rich bar tender who goes down to Jamaica to start his own bar and meets a girl named Jordan (Shue). They fall in love and some problems occur. See what they are. The movie is about love, friendship, care, and comedy."
2,NOT A VERY GOOD DRINK,"Another Tom Cruise 'slice of life' film in which he plays a budding bartender. You can't go very far with that synopsis. All budding bartenders eventually realize there's more to life. This is like the characters from ""Midnight Cowboy"" with credit cards."
2,Good Movie but should be more features for Blu Ray,"When they decided to take this classic to Blu Ray, they should have had some features on this deal instead of just the movie. They shouldhave got the cast together to share stories on this as well as the direxctors on the making of the movie. I am sure some footage exists of deleted scenes, out takes, the making of the film, the TGI Fridays in Times Square where this was made could have done something as well. There is so much missing out of this deal for a blu rayrelease. Hopefully they decide to do another edition with some features in it."
1,"As ""Great-Awful"" as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space""!","This movie is one of those sublimely awful movies that should be savored line by line, wretched moment by wretched moment.As truly awful as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""So awful it's terrifying at first, then mesmerizing, then strangely exhilirating--I mean, can people really conceive of something THIS bad?The ""Best Worst"" Film of the entire 80s, by a long shot."
1,Avoid,"If you don't know what I.Q. is, but if you did, you are sure you could count your's without takeing off more than one shoe ( only if you are sure ) you may enjoy this film."
1,Whatever Were They Thinking,"Whatever were they thinking when they dreamed up this one!? What's next, a movie glorifying busboys??"
4,Good all around entertainment,Just a great favorite of mine from a while back. Always loved Elisabeth Shue!
3,Not totally satisfied,"not sure what the problem is, or if its even the fault of the actual dvd, but the picture quality is pretty awful. its grainy, and dark. i get a better picture when im' watching something on regular tv, on a station that is NOT HD. other than that, it was delivered quickly which was nice, just the quality has bummed me out a bit..."
3,Very enjoyable until the last third.,Nothing is more entertaining in this film than watching Tom Cruise and Bryan Browne tossing around bottles and singing a bunch of songs from the 80s. Looks silly now but in the 80s it was the coolest thing. Their relationship is extremely entertaining to watch on screen. When Cruise heads off to a Jamiaca resort you see all the exotic scenary you could want to see. It is very entertaining and enjoyable. The last third of the film when Cruise is trying to win back Elizabeth Shue and Browne's life is falling apart is such a terrible way to conclude this film. It completely ruins the feel of the first two thirds. Overall the film is worth it but the last third is brutal to sit through. Great performances from Cruise and Browne though.
3,Not bad,The bag is a bit on the thin side especially on the bottom. I do like the bag but I wish it was a little thicker in material wiseo n the bottom. It's not like super thick so it seems like it'll sag when fully loaded. FIt and finish are good though.
5,A good read..,"This book gives a broad overview of both QNT as well as QLT procedures. This book explains what really matters in statistics... design, methods, and data collection techniques."
3,Thoughts from an SP,"Good story. The spelling/grammar errors detracted from the quality, as did the numerous errors in SP related acronyms, equipment and operations. Kind of made me wonder if the author had been an SP, or to what duties he performed. STILL a good story and I enjoyed it"
5,Great,"Very Pleased with series. Purchased ""Learn Spanish in your Car"" first and hated it. Pimsleur is much much better"
4,My son loves it!,My son received this for Christmas and loves it. It's recommended for ages 3 & up but he is only 19 months and can easily match up the pieces since there is a picture of the matching piece underneath. It would be great if the pieces could stay attached with tiny magnets or something because they do come out easily as far as storing goes. Highly recommended regardless!
4,another excellent melissa and doug product,"Both my children have enjoyed this ABC product. I am always happy with Melissa and Doug products. My 2 year old received this for Christmas and loves the realistic pictures of the animals, some of the aminals are hard the figure out for her but with my explanation she caught on quick. The only concern I have is the durability of the puzzle pieces because she can be rough with them. But I will continue to purchase Melissa and Doug products for their quality, price and educational value."
2,Beautiful puzzle...not for alphabet beginners,This is such a beautiful puzzle and my toddler loves it. I bought it thinking I could help him learn the alphabet but the puzzle pieces are not really shaped like the alphabet and the picture on the puzzle peice is dustracting from the letter it is supposed to represent. Otherwise a great puzzle for older kids.
2,Only if you know NOTHING,"This book was rather disappointing to me. I thought that it would have good tips on how to take certain photos with a digital camera, like out side shots, indoor shots, back lit shots and so on but it had very little of any such advice. It seems to me that this book is more a sales pitch for digital cameras and their versatility. Unless you have no idea how to get started choosing a digital camera or how do use the ?digital darkroom? do not get this book. If you have a basic knowledge of digital cameras or own one all ready and have a basic knowledge of ?digital darkroom? software do not get this book you will all ready know everything that is mentioned."
1,"Basic, basic, basic","If you are thinking about buying a digital camera, or if you own one and know absolutely nothing about it, then this may be the book for you. If you already own a digital camera and you're looking to improve your photography skills, then you need something more advanced than this. This book only covers the very basics of digital photography.The only section I found helpful were some of the tips and tricks cooncerning postprocerssing of images, but that alone would not warrant purchasing this book."
3,"Good, Not so Good",This book is for the very beginner. The only part that I found useful was the post processing. There is enough in the post processing that warrants buying the book.
3,Field Trip For Digital Photography,"After reading the original Photography Field Guide I anticipated this one to be at least as good and better since it is aimed at DSLR. It is a very superficial, cursory booklet that is of very little help to me or anyone else unless they are just looking for a snapshot of information. Considering the cheap price, it may not be a waste of money but it will certainly send you looking for more depth elsewhere."
2,Not nearly what I expected,"Bought this book with a lot of hope that it'd have an over abundance of information. While it does have good information, nothing super informative that I haven't read online or in other books. I wouldn't say not a good one to have as it's compact and has great images (National Geographic of course!). But don't expect anything absolutely spectacular!"
3,A little out of date...,"The book is ok, especially for those that started with non digital photography. Some of the technological infomation is out of date...If you really want a guide I recommend ""The Digital Photography Book by Scott Kelby"", it is filled with nice tips."
3,Not really about improving your digital photos,"When I purchased this book, I was looking for info on how to improve my digital photography. I already use quite a few of color and lighting options offered on my camera, but wanted to get better info on things like f-stops, ISO's, and lots of the other options that are available. This was not the right book for that. The only useful info of that type it contained was an introduction to using histograms to evaluate light balance. Instead, this book really addresses everything except the taking photographs. There's plenty of info how the cameras work, and what to do after you've taken the pictures, but not much about how to improve your actual photography. If that's what you want info on, you might really like this book, but it wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Amusing but way off the mark,"The food writing was lackluster, sort of the McDonald's version of foodie literature. The astrology connection was downright comical. Each of the categories is vague and non-specified. The first time I talked to friends about it, they were amazed at how well their preferences lined up with what the book said they should be. I soon noticed however that the categories were vague and il-defined. As an experiment I decided to re-read the same passages to other friends, assigning completely different signs to the alleged recommendations.People were equally enthralled by how ""accurate"" the book was.The message was clear. The author has managed to compose a series of sign specific food recommendations that are so vague and so generalized that almost ANYONE will see at least some of their tastes reflected in it."
1,Public Domain Content Only,"Just an FYI - A quick google on the UPC reveals a great many retailers are listing this item, and the content is dated between 1926 and 1938. That means this is yet another compilation of Hitchcock titles that are in the Public Domain (not protected by copyright). Other retailers have it listed for as little as $5.99 with free shipping.Note for the ""reviewer"" who asked why no one was listing the content while complaining about the lack of a content list. The DVD hasn't been released yet - How are they supposed to know? Given the St. Clair Group's stellar record of providing zero information, and their oh so informative website, how exactly does one derive this info?C'mon now, get a grip and relax. This is but another example of someone trying to cash in on Hitch's name. The latest in a very long line of poorly mastered compilations of Public Domain material by publishers who care for nothing except what it will take to separate you from your money."
1,huh?,"Who is going to buy unknown titles? The marketing ""experts"" know nothing about who buys films and what film buyers care about."
1,"""Finest"" is a subjective term.","Along with the rest of these reviewers, I won't be purchasing unknown titles. However, I probably wouldn't, anyway. Obviously, they're not going to sell a collection of titles like Vertigo, Rear Window, North by Northwest, or Strangers on a Train for $9.98. Only a completist fan is likely to want all nine of these films, whatever they are; and a completist fan likely already owns them, maybe even in better quality."
1,No Information-No Sale,"Does anyone expect to sell any product without a description of what they selling?Who buys anything, not knowing what they are purchasing?Would anyone teach their children that it's a smart thing to spend money for something they have no knowledge of?Where I came from, we were taught better sense than that!"
1,Never recieved the item.,"On the tracking and shipping page it said that the item was delivered, however I never received it."
1,So what are the movies???,"Sorry to mislead, but this is not a review. I read the reviews hoping to see which of the ""Finest"" movies are on the DVD for only 9.99. I still don't know, and wonder why (no offense) the reviewers, if they saw the DVD, complained that the titles weren't given, and then they didn't either! Just wondering..."
5,Hygieia: A Woman's Herbal,"Written before books on women's health or herbs were popular, Hygieia has remained a classic on women's health, spirituality and spirit through three decades! A book not just about herbs and herbal healing. Hygieia touches deeply the soul, begs us to reevaluate our relationship to our health and introduces us to the spirit of the green through ancient lore and modern tales. I love this book.It is simply one of my favorites."
5,A YOUNG WOMAN,"I am a young woman who is most interested in my reproductive years which are in the beginning stages now.I find that by reading Jeannine's book, Hygieia: A Woman's Herbal is like sitting with a dear sister who guides me in and out of all my questions.She is experienced and concise and I do appreciate the candid explanations and language.Most of my friends feel indifferent about becoming able to have a baby...they hate their periods and are always cramping and complaining even using tampons.I feel so blessed to be able to have a copy of this book.I feel it should be in every YOUNG WOMAN'S library as a source of comfort and knowledge.Thanks Jeannine Parvati for this book.Dream Weaver"
1,Horrible!,"I can not begin to express how disappointed I am with this book.A few things that bothered me were:The book is full of opinions of herbal uses. While there may be some truths and things to be learned from this book, weeding through the gross misinformation is troublesome.The hard to read calligraphy and fonts.The ridiculous glossary. Most definitions are just the authors OPINIONThe dangerous section on using LSD, Peote, and mushrooms even during pregnancy.A photo of a nude little girl. No, not playing in the sprinkler, just standing there posed and the photo is of her torso and genital area.I truly wanted to like this book. I was just so turned off by it though.I would suggest Susun Weed's book ""Wise Woman herbal for the Childbearing Year"". Susun's book is still funky and hippie-ish, but not so far out there like Hygieia, that it leaves a bad taste in your mouth."
5,Wonderful book covering many topics,"I was lucky to find this book when I was a college student, just beginning to understand and appreciate the power of herbs. It is a book that has stuck with me as I've grown older and now one that I'm re-reading more thoroughly now that I'm expecting my first child. For any woman interested in getting touch with her own health, and for tapping into the aged wisdom of generations of women before us, read this book and adopt some herbal traditions. It's a shame this wisdom isn't an integral part of our lives."
5,combines brilliant historiography with practicality,"The thing that has always amazed me, and many other people, about Jeannine Parvati, is her uninhibited combination of the power, perceptivity and instincts of an ancient curandera with the skills and sophisitication of a modern professional midwife. I can't speak from the perspective of a woman, but I was the first to welcome all 3 of my children into this world. At such times, Jeannine Parvati has helped me to contact the macrocosm through my microcosm. ""Nine powers of nine flowers,/Nine powers in me combined,/Nine buds of plant and tree./Long and white are my fingers/As the ninth wave of the sea."""
4,Good book on a rainy night!!!,"I really liked this book and I would have given five stars if it weren't for the whole sabotage debacle and Grant not dropping the sarcasm even after he finds out that she's an innocent, other than that I really liked the plot and everything. I did not want to put this book down. I wanted Grant to be a man and admit his mistakes, it took him too long to realisze his love for her. She never really stood up for herself the way you think she would have. But yet and still I kept reading. Really good book."
5,Great read,"Great book. The characters were strong, plot was great. I really liked the heroine. She wasn't a meek typical woman in romance novels. She was gutsy, and smart, and could hold her own. I liked that she had leverage over the hero. It kept my interest throughout this book, and the descriptions were great. I could picture being there in Kentucky adn seeing the beautiful horses. Great read for sure."
4,Extra large and well made,"This travelcover is a very good bargain for those wanting a very large cover that is well made. For some, it may be too large and bulky. It actually fits two small carry bags, but the combined bags may weigh too much for air travel and would be difficult to manage."
2,Unfortunate purchase,"I purchased this for my clubs, and upon trying it out the zipper broke. Luckily, I still had time to run to the local sports store to purchase a replacement. My money was fully refunded, but was disappointed with the product."
4,COOL GAME,"GREAT GAME, MY 4 YEAR OLD SON LOVE IT AND I LOVE TO PLAY WITH HIM, HE LIKES ALL THE CARS MOVIE GAMES, THANKS"
3,This game is for much younger ones,I actually purchased this one for my niece. But atually I ended up keeping it. BUT THIS IS REALLY REALLY MEANT for KIDDDDDDDDS
4,1/5 Cut Tab,"File Folders Smead 1/5 Cut Tab (Legal Assorted) / B0015ZW3TAThere's five colors in this pack, with five of each color, for 25 total legal-size hanging file folders. The Cut Tabs are a bit nice - each file has a number of cut insets in the top of the file, and you can insert the file tabs into the location of your choice, to be moved as necessary. It's kind of a nifty feature in that you can move the tab inserts around as needed, without having to worry about tape or glue.~ Ana Mardoll"
4,AMAZON'S REVIEW RE 'FANGED GENITALIA' WASN'T OVERSTATEMENT,". . . it was just the tip of the iceberg. Nothing graphic, or objectionably too-realistic (pornographic) but prurient in an adolescent way. The dated but still good animation cuts down an X-rating to a light R. Dubbing, which one reviewer dinged, seemed fine to me; actually the inflection and 'acting' was pretty good. I was entertained, with not a few smirks throughout.One of the better animes within this soft-porn/action genre. Could've been a pretty good movie; the CGI treatment would be interesting to see. If anyone wants to see a Japanese movie of this sort, see ICHI THE KILLER or FUDOH."
4,"Wow... Good stuff, old school brutal anime!","This .... is ... so good!!!!same makers as Ninja scroll, so same type of animationthis movie is super cool it hs a great plot, it's very Dark and brutala lot of Blood, a lot of sex and nudity, tourture, some monster rape not (NOT porn hentia style) and anime violence in old school,this is the type of ninja scroll, demon hunter kind of movies.it's just great and fun to watcha lot of fantasy, erotic and bloody scenas here .the movie has great graphics to it and it looks good, animation is very good."
3,Not really what I had in mind...,"I was expecting more of a monster/action movie, instead I got a monster/hentai movie. It wasn't bad, but I wish there were more monster's, more fighting, and less smut. But like I said it wasn't a bad movie, had a few funny parts, the romance was interesting, the monsters were interesting, the few fighting parts were well animated, I thought the American voice actors did a good job, and at least the hentai parts weren't in super bad taste. Definitely for 18+ audience."
2,A bizaar story...,"Cops meets Demon City in a world vividly recreated by some fine artists in this anime. The story is a little dry really but interesting. For the most part it is a worthy purchase but many will find it too dull if they expect another Demon City. The movie never quite harnesses it's opening eerie environment, and then loses its hold on you as the story drags on. The themes are mature and there is nudity and graphic violence. Basically a cop must fight demons before they come and take over the dimension in which humans live. A dirty old man is the secret to stopping them and he is hired to protect him. A few laughs involving the old mans ruthless desires to the demon woman who was sent to also protect him. The cop falls for the demon girl in text book format and the story progresses until you wake up."
1,Obsoleted by modern anime,"If you are looking for a graphically outdated movie with dull action scenes, a loose plot, and many rape/relations scenes, this movie might be for you. However, don't get too excited just yet, almost all of the adult scenes really don't show anything graphic, but rather use grunts/moans and implied movements instead.As for alternatives, if you are looking for a good horror flick, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust is a good option. If you wish to see a horror flick with great visuals, Blood the Last Vampire is a good option. If you are looking for a horror flick with gratuitous gore and female nudity, Ninja Scroll is a good choice. Lastly, if you are looking for an action/horror series, Hellsing is a great pick.Bottom line: there are many better anime movies out there then Wicked City regardless of what you are looking for in a horror movie. Let this old dog sleep."
1,Wicked Waste of Money,"Wicked City is by far one of the worst animes I have ever seen. I'm a huge fan of Ninja Scroll, but Wicked City lacks any positive qualities such as good characters, plot, artwork, or even music. I do enjoy anime gore and some sexuality, but this one just went over the edge. Many of the scenes became ridiculously cheesy and/or gross causing me to laugh or just simply turn my head. Hardcore anime fans may just want to rent this one once to experience its ""unique"" style, but I urge everyone to at least watch Wicked City once before buying it to determine if you can stomach its content. I had high hopes for this movie, but it just kept getting worse and worse and I regret ever buying it."
1,"Sick, Twisted World",I caught this movie on late night cable about a month ago and it has disturbed me ever since. I lost count in the amount of violence especially towards women. How do you have a woman raped by two men and ten minutes later have sex with the one man she is attracted to and who saved her life. A woman is depicted as a spider who shoots webbing from her genetalia? Movies like this make me wonder more about the persons who create this madness. All I can think of is that they are future rapists and serial killers. My sons love Japanese anime. I pray they never come across this movie.
4,"exhilirating and gross, brilliant","this one is pitted on demons. theres this old horny guy that is awesome and he kicks ass in the end battle ontop of that roof. theres nudity in here and some rape scenes but that doesnt where down the action and gore. favorite part is when the goodguy shoots his shotgun and he flys back like, when he shoots it, right, he instantly flys back from the shotgun blast, its cool. see it man"
2,Laughable,"How can any one watch ""Wicked City"" and keep a straight face? Do people actually get off on animated nudity and sex? That thought is even more frightening and hilarious than this film. I've watched a lot of Anime in my life and have had to tolerate a lot. Even ""Urotsukidoji / Legend of the Overfiend"" has more merits than this film. ""Wicked City"" is probably the worst I've seen. It's not really that the content disturbs me. It's the plot of two agents trying to save a dirty old man that is obsessed with porn and whenever he has sex with a woman, she happens to turn into an alien and try to kill him. Not to mention monsters rapping a woman every other scene. It's just too silly and absurd for me. The quality is pretty good and has a moody dark style. The English dubbed actors do a good job but it's all in vain for such a lousy plot and tendencies to show more sex then plot."
1,Aliens with a big sharp toothed ...,"Pretty bad, but it moves along well enough that it works for a Bad Movie Night. If you like to sit around with friends and laugh at how bad a movie can be then this is a good contender. My favorite part is that the captain is a perfectly ineffectual middle manager. He sits in his ""office"" and sends one person after another to go investigate and then broadcasts [weak] suggestions to them as they walk to their deaths."
3,"NOT anamorphic. ""narrow letterbox""","A good low buget movie with Judy Geeson, but a 2.35:1 letterbox is rediculous. Anything with that ratio should be anamorphic. I have to hit the zoom on the widescreen tv and that soffens the image. Don't know if it is cropped on top and bottom yet. I'll have to see a vhs version."
3,In Space No One Can Hear You Scream....In Laughter!!!,"This movie was released in the U.S. under the title HORROR PLANET. I remembered it because of the creepy baby alien on the cover. I remember I hated and loved it back in 1982 as a kid, and knew I had to get it.If you are having some friends over for drinks you might wanna watch this one as it's hilarious!!Poor Judy Geason and Stephanie Beacham are the only actors doing their best to act above and beyond the silly dialogue and situations.The rest of the cast are terrible and the characters make serious mistake after mistake just to wind up sliced or diced.Still it's fun to watch all these big name actors (in England anyway) run around cheap sets from a really great Judy Geason."
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased this video set. I submitted a fair review which was never printed. This video set is of the poorest quality. The film clips are a poor dub of a third or fourth generation copy. I can't imagine that anyone would want to keep these tapes, they are easily the worst video quality I have ever seen. I hope this review will be printed. I submit it as a public service to others who may be considering purchase of this product."
1,Save Your Money!,"This is the worst quality VHS production (if you can call it that) that I have ever seen. The audio bounces back and forth between mono and stereo, the sound drops out. The video looks like a third genration copy of a pal original coverted to ntsc. Someone projected some of the films on the wall and pointed a hand held camera at it."
5,Great for everyone!,"This book has become a classic,-- and a hit;-- for more than ten reasons. It is multilayered, and yet presents a unity of ideas: The material, and the writing is engaging for the beginner, and for the research mathematician alike. When I used it in my teaching, it was equally popular with the math students, and those from engineering. I don't know if I can say this about any other book I have taught from. The students could follow all the carefully presented proofs, and the engineer could generate algorithms from the applied chapters."
4,Not for the faint of heart!,"This book is a treasure of details if you know what you are doing. As another reviewer noted, it is not for the beginner. But if you have had some experience with the subject this is a must have for your library shelf."
1,"Great series, terrible DVD","I love the show, but I've decided from now on I will rate any DVD I come across that does not have closed captioning an automatic 1 star."
2,"A disappointing, diluted version of an epicurean classic.","Don't expect this to be the classic French Larousse, which comes in a condensed one-volume version and a full three-volume set.The American Larousse is, as many things American tend to be, watered- and dumbed-down for our nation's less-sensitive palates.Just as with its French cousin, the American Larousse, contains many color plates featuring dishes and ingredients featured in its pages. However, the the American Larousse appears to have approximately one-third of the content of the French version. As a purely illustrative example, the American version's section on sweetbreads is approximately two columns' worth of loosely-packed print, while the French version features six pages of dense text on the subject.Especially in light of its cost, the American Larousse is a bitter disappointment. The epicure wishing to have ready access to a gastronomic bible would be well-advised to obtain the French version in its place."
2,Are you sure this is the one for you???,"I think that prospective purchasers of this book should be aware that a three volume Larousse Gastronomique exists and that it is available at Amazon.fr., and, if they would be interested in that one over this one, perhaps they should look into it before buying this one. That set, however, costs."
5,BEST,ONE OF BEST EXITING MOVIES OF ALL TIMES FULL OF ACTIONYOU HAVE THIS DVD YOU MUST KEEP IT BECAUSE ITS THAT GOOD
4,A GREAT MOVIE AND I'M GLAD TO FINALLY KNOW IT'S ON DVD,"AN FBI AGENT [SIDNEY POITIER, IN WHAT WAS HIS 1ST ROLE IN A LONG TIME] AND A TRACKER [TOM BERENGER] TEAM UP TO LOCATE THE WHEREABOUTS OF A KILLER. LOT OF ACTION AND LOT OF SUSPENSE MAKE THIS A PLEASANT FILM TO WATCH. AND THE ACTING IS GOOD TOO. GET THIS FILM NOW. YOU DEFINITELY WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED."
3,Shoot to Kill DVD Review,Shoot to Kill is an entertaining crime drama. The DVD is of very good quality.
5,Very pleased,The product was just as advertised. Completely sealed and new from factory. Very pleased and will use this company again.
5,PURE ENTERTAINMENT,"This film did not a received a lot of exposure at the time of its release, but it clearly shows what good acting can do. Sidney Poitier did many of the stunts himself and this was when he was in his 60's. Tom Berenger was also excellent in his roll and the two characters played well off of one another. I already own it on laser disc and can't wait to own it on DVD. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good action thriller. It does not disappoint."
4,Fast-paced and exciting!,"This entertaining and engaging action-adventure will have you on the edge of your seat. If you loved Cliffhanger and The River Wild, you will love this. I don't care how you see it, just see it. You won't be sorry. While you're at it, check out Sneakers, Little Nikita, and The Jackal. Sidney Poitier gives just as good a performance in these."
4,Solid Action,"This movie has good solid action, a compelling story line, great scenery of the Pacific Northwest. Sidney Poitier is always very watchable and he doesn't let us down here. I'll buy this one on DVD when it's available."
5,Great gift,"This was a gift for my boyfriend and he couldn't be happier. This was pretty much impossible find in a store near me so I'm glad Amazon had this available, and for such a great price. Fast shipping and good packaging."
3,"Oscar worthy? No, but a fun Saturday night flick","Early Chris Tucker flick, and he is in his element. Charlie Sheen looks baffled by Chris Tucker's riffing and doesn't really keep up, with Charlie acting as if it is high drama. But, if you are looking for a fun, funny movie, put on the popcorn. You can't really go wrong."
2,Sorry,"This movie is so freakin stupid. Yes its funny...but so very dumb. Not good dumb; bad dumb. Terribly, painfully stupid. Funny at times. Best avoided or taken in small doses."
4,Meet Vic Damone Jr.,"I don't care what anybody else says. This movie is utterly hilarious. Yes, the humor is crude at times and Chris Tucker must say the ""f"" word 5,000 times. But, his delivery is unbelievable. Perfect timing. Imagine Chris Tucker passing himself off as the son of Vic Damone and Dianne Carroll! He attends a posh Italian American wedding reception and tells everyone he is Vic Damone Jr. There is a scene where Chris calls in a bomb threat at a disco that made me laugh so hard I hurt afterward. Charlie Sheen is a terrific partner in crime. If you liked Rush Hour, you will also like Money Talks. Comedy mixed with some pretty graphic violence. But it works! Take a chance on this one. It's worth it."
3,a decent comedy,"I saw this movie twice and I still liked it the second time as much as the first but the one thing that really offended me when watchig this movie is how many times ""God----"" is used over and over. I realize that Money Talks is rated R for language but I find it ridiculous to over-use the Lord's name in movies."
4,4 Stars - due to Chris Tucker,"I first watched this simply because I enjoy Chris Tucker (Friday, Rush Hour.) I was not dissapointed. Chris Tucker really shines in this flick... Friday fans could imagine Tucker's character being Smokey a few years down the road. Slick talking as usual and constantly in trouble, Tucker hooks onto Charlie Sheen's character cause Sheen drug him down. Now the two are trying to clear Tucker's name and nail a big story in the process. Paul Sorvino really does well in this flick also. Sorvino bidding against the bad guys is hilarious. Must watch for any Tucker fans and also great for anyone who wants a good carefree laugh."
1,Junk,254 pages of politically correct academic claptrap for $74.00 - they have to be joking. Watching paint dry is more interesting than ploughing through this junk.
5,SALT DREAMS wins major awards,*Winner of the 1999 Western States Book Award for Creative Non-Fiction. *Winner of the 1999 Clements Prize for the Best Non-Fiction Book on Southwestern America.
3,Too many mediocre episodes,"This series showed a lot of promise in the beginning, and watching the early episodes is time well spent.But midway through the year the quality of the scripts plunged, and there are just too many mediocre episodes for me to give this four stars.I recommend that you wait to get this till it's on sale."
5,Only 27 Episodes... Too Bad!,"I had never heard of ""Johnny Staccato"" before but I don't watch the trash they call TV these day's and rely on DVD's of classic TV series for entertainment. Thought I take a chance on this and have not regret in doing so as it has become one of my favorites. The story lines are great, the intro awesome and Johnny is just too cool. The more I watch this show the more I can't understand why it only lasted one season, just love it and believe you will too."
5,"Soemehow, I remember this series....","Naturally, I'm way to young to have been of a discerning age when these were broadcast but I do remember the mood of these episodes.. Classic film noir with John (Star Wars) Williams playing the piano when Johnny tags him. Some of the stories creak a little but,overall, this is a welcome re-issue. Play ""spot the stars when they were younger"" - great fun"
5,Great value in HDTV,"Just bought this unit. The picture quality on antenna or satellite via S-video is excellent. Set up is relatively easy and the remote is better than most, with buttons and a joystick. Even my wife the luddite can use it, although she gravitates back to the old separate remotes because she has been trained over 9 years to use those. Unit is compact and fits in my entertainment unit. The biggest factor for me is value. This TV delivers the most wanted HDTV features,eg progressive scan, the necessary inputs, a great picture, a useable universal remote, at about $300 less than comparable units. Guarantee is somewhat better than most at 12/12 as well. If you want HDTV and a great all around TV and do not want to over-pay, this is your TV."
5,"hitachi 32""","excellent choice over eve flat screen sony so much saving great picture which expands to fill entire scrreen less wieght , cost and less size to cabinet an you have avery good deal LIKE THE OTHER REVIEWER IT SEEMS A NO BRAINR I DON'T NEED A FLAT SCREEN WHEN ALL THE OTHER STUFF IS SO GOOD"
2,ok.. but there are some severe flaws.. read my review,"Ok.. This is a fun kettle. It boils fine, whistles nicely... however the metal guard under the bottom of the handle will melt the plastic handle if it gets too hot. If you have a gas stove... it is not a good choice. Secondly, after a year... the spigot was rusting from the inside. The tea kettle has rust spots at the welds and stain marks down the inside of the kettle. I just wonder how long I have been drinking that. I would not buy this brand again. 1 Year is a very very short lifespan for a kettle. Not worth the bucks."
1,"an okay book, but not true to the setting","I grew up near Silk Hope, and it wasn't even close, which made the book a little disappointing for this reader.All in all the story was good--some really funny parts--but I was glad when it was through and that's unusual for me."
4,Very cool wall decor,I originally bought this for my son. Later I bought another one hung them on my wall and now I get a lot of cool compliments
5,Great Party Favors,"I bought this item to use in my sister's graduation party. She plans to be a nurse and the theme was as such. The Ouch Bubble Gum Band-Aids was a perfect match with the other party favors placed in a medical bag I created for each table.What you should expect: the 3 different flavored sticks of gum aren't shaped like band-aids - the individual wrappers have an illustration of a Band-Aid. The sticks of gum are full of sugar and are lightly dusted with flour so it won't stick to the inner foil wrapper. Don't expect high-quality on the flavor, but then again you should expect that when buying candy in mass quantities chosen specifically for decoration."
1,A Trip to the Ocean,"As soon as I read the back cover of this book I knew I had made a mistake. This is not about a trip to the ocean. This is about ""God's wonderful creation under the sea"". I was looking for a book about a trip to the ocean. When looking for and ordering this book, nowhere did it state that this is a religious book. If I had known that, I would not have bought the book. This review is to let others know and not make the same mistake."
1,terrible investigations,"These guys are by far the worst paranormal investigators. Each show consists of nonsense stories and crap evidence. In fact, the only evidence they have is 'oh, I'm hearing noises and feel cold, blah blah blah'. Don't waste your money on these dvds. The main guy doesn't know what he is talking about, and the rest are just kids with high tech toys. Buy Ghost Adventures, it's by far the best show out there and they provide credible evidence. Just a side note... I remember one episode where they think they have a demon in their presence. The main moron then states that 'its dangerous to even say aloud the name of this entity' because of how evil it is. That being said, for something so dangerous, they flash the name of the demon on the tv numerous times during the episode. Come on!! For something so evil, you flash it on the tv screen for the viewers at home? Fact of the matter: these guys suck and their info is completely contrary to paranormal experts."
5,The selfish one,"I liked this book it was much better than the last one. I like the spirit of Hannah. I am glad I didn't have to read much more about Barbara. She was self centered spoiled rotten brat, even in her adult hood.This is the type of book you can read in a day. I am glad that Ben and Hannah found each other."
3,Disappointing,"I have tried a lot of machetes over the years and almost always been disappointed. I bought an Ontario-- US made and supposedly very high quality. It isn't much better than the cheap machetes.The blade is thick and heavy, but that doesn't seem to help it in cutting anything. It doesn't take an especially good edge and doesn't hold it well. The edge geometry doesn't seem well-suited to cutting anything.I finally tried a Tramontina machete recently and I FINALLY have a machete I can call useful and reliable. The Tramontina arrived dull, but took a good edge and kept it. It cuts well, and I will definitely buy Tramontina if I need another machete."
5,"Great quality machete, heavy but sturdy & will get the job done right","This thing is great, it can cut anything from weeds to trees. I once lent it to a friend to sharpen with his new dremmel tool, but he screwed up the edge and dinged and nicked the blade up pretty good. Nothing a good old file can't fix and some time of more use and sharpening. Anyway, this machete is a bit on the heavy side, but it will give you some well needed wrist strength, a quality much needed by any outdoors-man. Also, it may have been the vendor that I bought this from to blame, but this thing came so dull when I bought it that I couldn't cut anything without using sheer brute force. That's irrelevant anyway most likely, as most people who own a nice piece like this should know how to sharpen, or at least start learning quick. The only con about this thing: it looks terribly intimidating when you bring it to the once a year family reunion picnic....don't go swinging this bad boy around like a maniac or you might get shot."
4,great lite machete,"Simple, but good quality machete. I had to modify the handle with a Dremel, it was not very comfortable at all, I've seen many others that have done the same."
5,What a gift!,I sent these bulbs to my son-in-law and daughter for an early Christmas gift last year. They were so pleased this spring and received so many compliments on their pretty flowers.
3,Taking the mask off the monster,"When a child is sexually abused, it isn't just the child that suffers. Peter has disclosed the journey into degradation and stands before the reader exposed and vulnerable. He documents the stages or cycles of deviance that led him into hurting his own daughter and tore his family up. Whether the reader is looking for some understanding of how anyone could sexually assault a child or the professional looking for insights to better treat the offender, this book is well worth reading. As a professional in the field of sex offender treatment, I recommend Breaking The Cycle."
3,Different Slant,"I was under the impression that Simone was female, so of course I thought the sound would have been different. However, the music was very pleasant, and romantic. I was just a little confused, I guess."
5,"""When the forest burns along the road...""","Soundgarden were vastly underrated in 1991. With the explosion of the Seattle grunge scene that year, Nirvana and Pearl Jam recieved a LOT of hype from critics. But I believe that the other two grunge acts from Seattle, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden, deserved just as much recognition for what they did to bring real hard rock back from the dead.With that being said, this record is ear candy to the ardent hard rocker. Songs like ""Outshined"", ""Rusty Cage"", ""Drawing Flies"", and others will get you hooked on Badmotorfinger. Chris Cornell's voice is astounding on this record. So pick this gem up today. Hard rock does not get much better than this."
4,Great follow up.,Great follow.up to their last cd. It still has tbeir overall heaviness in both the lyrics as well as the guitar. Outshined is the best so.g and stands out as one of their best ever.
4,"About This Title, Um, Well...","It starts out strong with the first two tracks, then kind of falls apart. I don't know what happened with the rest of the album. There are a few parts that are good, but aside from the first two tracks, good songs are pretty scarce. I still love Soundgarden though. I strongly prefer Superunknown to this album. It is so obviously better than Badmotorfinger."
5,Extraordinary.,"If you like the unique Soundgarden sound then this album is for you, each track being a classic in is own right. This once again confirms Soundgarden as one of the most inventive and talented bands of the 90s. A must buy!"
4,Blinding,Great record from one of the best bands of their (or any other) time.Quick pointer to another review from Eric Amos from South California. The album is Soundgarden's 3rd (4th if you count the Sceaming Life / Fopp EPs CD) and NOT their debut. It is also astonishing and not the unlistenable atrocity that your review seems to suggest.
5,Soundgarden's Best Album,"This is another grunge essential. It's brutal metal mixed with punk rock, and it's a masterpiece. My favorite song has to be ""Jesus Christ Pose"". It's brutal and intense, which is how grunge was meant to be. ""Slaves and Bulldozers"" has one of the best bass lines crafted, while ""Rusty Cage"" and ""Outshined"" are classics.""Superunknown"" is as good, but a little mellower. ""Down On The Upside"" is mediocre, but ""Louder Than Love"" and ""Ultramega OK"" are also grunge classics.Don't even bother with ""Audioslave""."
2,there's been better!,i like the music but the lyrics are not so good. i wonder why they make this kind of stuff!
1,I have not recieved it yet.,I ordered this 2 weeks ago and it still hasnt arrived.So when Amazon claims it ships within 24 hours dont believe them.My rating will change if I ever do recieve it but if I still dont get it Im sticking with the 1 star rating
1,Thank g0d grunge died out!,"Soundgarden are pompous, overblown, pretentious, and epitomise all that was rotten about music in the 1990s. Along with NIrvana, ALice in Chains, and Pearl Jam, Soundgarden were one of those flannel clad, shoe gazing alternative rock bands record companies forced on the public during the early 1990s grunge explosion. Their lyrics were filled with pretentious angst and frustration, which appealed to snobby suburban rich kids who thought their lives were miserable just because their yuppie parents didn't give them a high enough allowance. But we all grow up eventually, and by the time we are adults, angst ridden grunge music no longer appeals to us. THank g0d grunge is dead. GRunge sucks. It is the nu metal of the early 90s, unsophisticated music for unsophisticated listeners. Sounds really dated."
3,Interesting but long,"I read this book some time ago, and its issues and characters still stand out in my mind, which seems the sign of a good story. On the other hand, I thought about a third of the book could have been cut. If you are interested in white people's involvement in the civil rights movement or current racial issues in the deep South or marriage and parenting issues, there's something in this book for you. Its worth reading, though there might be parts to skim."
2,Long and Drawn Out,"I had to convince my mind that the story line would lead to something interesting. Boy, was I wrong. Lots of distractions with no climax."
1,The Worst Book I've Ever Read,"This had to be the dryest, dullest novel that I have ever read. The characters are very unrealistic and difficult to relate to. Although the idea of the civil rights movement is important, this novel portrays this subject in the dry manner. For anyone looking to be bored out of their minds this summer, pick up this book. For anyone who wants a good read, select any other title at random--it has to be better that this one!"
1,Beware Of This One!,"For years and years, I was a fan of the Philips name for all my blank DVD needs. Not anymore. I purchased this pack for $5 and wondered why my burns were failing. The software and burner checked out ok. Every one of the discs I tried had failed burns. It was verified when I used Memorex ones and those came out ok; no problem at all, at any burn speed. I've since gone on to T-Blue for they are ""professional grade"".Save your money."
4,A compelling thought provoking story,"I had no idea this group had been around for so long...this documentary by writer/ director Sergio Myers focused on the cult members' story, not the media's. The heaven's gate home videos were amazing, it added a lot of depth..."
1,MORE FICTION THAN FACT,"I am an expert on cults and was hired by the FBI to perform an in depth study on the Heaven's Gate group. I watched ""Heaven's Gate The Untold Story"" and I was horrified that the producer could try to pass this off as a documentary. I have never seen so much editorializing in a so-called documentary. It was poorly produced, biased and unbalanced, and not worth the hour of my time it took to watch it. Other elements, such as the music, were out of place and just plain weird.I personally would not purchase this video, especially if you are looking for the real story of what happened."
1,Amateur attempt to cash in on human tragedy.,"I'm not sure what the previous reviewers were watching, but it certainly wasn't the tape I viewed. I have done several stories on US based cults, and this amateur style documentary, was obviously thrown together, haphazardly, in a desperate attempt to drain a few nickles out of the pool of human suffering. Clearly the producer has no idea of story cohesion, or of the most simple of lighting techniques available. I am a documentary producer at the University of Chicago, and it appalls me that someone would try to pass this off as legitimate research. There is far more in depth coverage in Newsweeks articles detailing the cult, and can be read in 15 minutes. Having to sit through this docu-style farce, is the real tragedy. The poor victims of that cult chose to take thier own life. You will too if you watch this...docu-debacle."
4,Etch A Sketch,This model is a lot smaller than the origional. Works the same. The word classic in its descriptoin is misleading.
2,Not what I remembered in quality or size,I ordered 2 of these for my grandchildren because I had so much fun with them growing up. I was disappointed because they are smaller than they used to be and the lines you draw are too fine. They don't erase as easily either. I would love to find the original etch a sketch but I'm afraid that doesn't exist anymore.
4,Timeless classic,"I bought this for my two year old for Christmas. It's a classic and it's built well and is very durable. Although it's smaller than the one I had as a child, it's quality has not changed.I'm very pleased."
3,It ain't what it used to be!,"My (adult) brother is an Etch A Sketch fanatic! But he's forever losing his or people break them. I purchased this as a gift for him. He was quick to point out that they're made out of cheap plastic and they're much smaller than the original. Don't let the throw-back ""original"" packaging fool you as it did me."
3,not as good as the ones of my memories...,"...but I'll still be giving one to the little kids of my acquaintance. Yes, this edition is a much flimsier imitation, and isn't as smoothly operating as I'd like. It's still fun to play with."
2,They just don't make them like they used too.,"Not like the Etch A Sketch I remember as a kid. Sure it looks the same and feels the same. Does not draw with the same intensity. When you go to erase the image, the image does not erase completely. The lines are still there......"
2,Not the Etch A Sketch I remember!,"I bought the Etch A Sketch for my 2 year old grandson thinking he would have fun watching the lines being drawn on the screen. The Etch A Sketch I remember as a child had a strong, thick, dark line when I drew on it. I could easily tell where I was and where I wanted to go.The line on this new Etch A Scetch is barely visible! I can hardly see it myself. My grandson was unimpressed and almost immediately lost interest. And like another reviewer mentioned, what line you do have won't shake out! What a disappointment! I should have purchased him another Savings Bond. Next time I will shop retail so I can try it out first hand."
1,"Great Toy, but quality was horrible","My Kids love etch-a-sketch, but the two we bought were broken right out of the box. You could not see the drawings, they were too faint.We returned them and Amazon honored the return right away."
1,Very Disappointed,"Some of the other reviewers were right, the toy we received drew lines so faint you have to go back over them. Very disappointed."
2,Vary bad quality,"The trace is very thin, the lines almost no detectable. Very bad quality because the wheels stuck all the time"
3,good,"had interesting things to say that i did not really know. nice illustrations to help you understand the story better. a good read, even got my other friend interested!!!!!!!"
4,French 'chanson' at its best,"These are songs based on poems by the French poet Aragon, mostly about love and romance, but some on the human condition in general. The beautiful lyrics have been turned into mostly beautiful music sang with competence, a beautiful voice, warmth and emotional commitment by Jean Ferrat. Originally published in the 80s it has long deserved a reissue on CD and here it is. Nevertheless, at almost US$ 20 I find it quite expensive."
2,None of us will know where we will love...,"..but it sure won't be in the pages of this book.OK, I'll admit, I used to love this book. Absolutely and singlemindedly..... when I was in grade 3. Seriously. There are some parts to it that are actually good, like when Erik is in Persia or ROme.((hence the 2 star rating)) The rest reads like sheer melodrama, which is sad, because this book had great potential.Anyway, the story is intreguing, instead of the basic Phantom story we all know, this starts from the very beginning, and chronicles the life of the extraordinary man, who would become the Phantom.For people who are considering this book, I'd reccomend reading it at the library first. As I said, the book's not bad.. but it wasn't what I remembered it to be. If you like it, then buy it.... don't just order it on a whim though (((unless I'm the only person who does that... heh heh... >_< ))"
2,Just OK,"I did not care for how this story was told, this book should have begun about 250 pages in. The first half of the book was very dull and took me quite awhile to read. The only thing this book made me desire was to read the original."
3,Phantom,"Susan Kay has created a Masterpiece...... This is one book I never wanted to end...I wanted more... Keep writing Ms. Kay, I will forever be a fan."
5,Great love story,I purchased this book years ago and immediately added it to my KEEPER shelf! It is a great alternative tale to the orginial PHANTOM OF THE OPERA.
4,Very good book,"Overall I enjoyed reading this book. In particular I found the various travels/history of the Phanthom amazing as it puts into context his life eventually at the Opera House in Paris. However, once the love story began, I found myself at times getting lost and not as entertaining. Overall a good read."
5,Breathtakingly Awesome.,"I have never felt this way about a book before. ""Phantom"" by Susan Kay was not simply a novel, but a mind-altering experience. I was literally trembling after I read it. Her prose is beautiful and haunting, and I guarantee you won't be able to forget about this book for a while. A must for not just phantom (Erik) lovers, but also for people who enjoy solid, top-notch writing."
5,The Phantom Lives!!!!,"Though I read this book about a few years ago, I am really greatful that it has come back into publishing. This is a very wonderful book that should not be kept away from any Phantom fan or any avid reader. This book is wonderfully written with such passion...it is so good that one might mistake this book as the original novel of the Phantom, but of course it is not. Susan Kay portrays Eric as the fallen angel that he is ought to be. Anybody who reads this book would automatically fall in love with the angel of music and would greatly appreciate that Susan Kay did not ruin the Phantom's image with just another fanfic."
5,We cannot help where we will love.,"This is by far, one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. Usually Erik is described as a souless, heartless monster, but Susan Kay brings a depth to the character never before seen. We learn why he is the way he is, and truly understand what it is to be truly alone."
5,wow,the story of erik that would make leroux proud. one becomes so involved in erik's life they want a differnt ending than the original. you cant help but fall in love with the man who was the phantom.
4,"A Little over romantic, but overall well-written","I read this years ago, and reread it, and reread it...It's a bit of a stretch, given the original novel, and timeline, but well written and a very fun fantasy to fall into on a cold, rainy day. Phantom Phans will especially love the more tender moments exchanged between Christine and Erik, and the friendship struck by Erik and the Daroga is well-thought out.All in all, a great read for my fellow dreamers."
5,Truly amazing...,"This is the exact supplement to the Leroux that Phantom phans were looking for. When I first heard about this book, years ago, I was incredibly skeptical. Needless to say, within the first few pages I was hooked and read it all within one day. The characters are all so real...They're emotions reach out and touch you. And Erik, the mysterious Phantom of the Opera, is suddenly so very human. Susan Kay is a marvelous writer, adding great depth to each of her characters. It is quite obvious that she loves Erik, for she tells his story as none other could have. Don't hesitate to buy this book! You won't be disappointed."
5,Susan Kay's triumph,"I own an original copy of this book, and will soon be purchasing this newer volume; as mine is quickly becoming dog-eared. With respect to Gaston Leroux - who GAVE us the Phantom - Susan Kay has given breath and life to the characters in a way NO ONE ever has or will again. To any planning to retell this story and market it: My suggestion is that you'd best read this one first. Susan Kay is a formidable author on this subject."
5,True Phantom of the Opera Fans Listen Up!,"I consider myself a TRUE Phantom of the Opera fan and was very skeptical of this book. I almost didn't read it because I didn't want anything to taint the original version. As a matter of fact, I didn't buy this book for myself - it was a gift. I had no intention of buying a copy-cat. Don't make the same mistake I almost made. This book if fabulous! A must read! I am back at amazon to order a couple more copies for my best friends. This book compliments the original Phantom of the Opera so well, and it is impossible to put down. Note: Have some Kleenex nearby! Wonderful!"
5,Was Hard to Get Through,"This book was hard for me to get through because of its intensity at moments. I had to put it away for a bit and then returned to it. I'm glad that I returned to it in a way because I both loved and hated the ending. I cried, laughed, cringed, and was repulsed as I read this book. It is not the book for the faint of heart or those who get bored easily since there are some parts that are slow. It was a good addition to my Phantom books collection."
4,The Phantom Lives,"I'm not a critic nor am I a reviewer, but I just finished this book and I'm walking around .like I just lost the love of my life. I can't believe how Ms. Kay brings this man to life from birth thru his life of suffering into middle age. This is a MUST read. I hope you enjoy the book as much as I did. Thanks Ms. Kay"
5,Simply the best!,"Susan Kay's ""Phantom"" sheds light onto a subject too often ignored in other interpretations. She delves deep into Erik's past daring the reader to believe the unbelievable- a human being is shunned by society because of his face. This telling of Erik's life gives the reader more insight into what makes Erik ""tick."" Through this book the reader will no longer regard Erik as a monster, ""twisted every way,"" but as a human being misunderstood by society.This book is quite possibly the best re-telling of the story, ""Phantom of the Opera,"" and by far surpasses the original. I commend Susan Kay for this literary masterpiece."
5,"Phantom, a heart-wrenching adaptation of a classic story","The movie performance of Lon Chaney ( easily the best movie portrayal of the Phantom) cannot compare to the very real very human character of Erik, the Phantom Of The Opera. Not even the original book depicts this man as such, relegating him to the shadows of movie monsterdom. ""Phantom"" draws this fascinating, brilliant, tortured person into someone who is almost real enough to reach out and touch. The focus builds to the climax of the kiss which Christine grants ""poor, unhappy Erik.""Even the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version pales in comparison.This is a book where you put the ALW musical on the CD player, curl up in front of your hearth, a cat purring contentedly at your side and the inevitable mug of hot tea.Easily my favorite book of all time. Its a treat and a tearjerker from beginning to end."
3,Hmmmm,"Well... I did like it. It was well-written, and interesting. But Erik is way too sexual and not half as humble as he should be. The entire comparison between his mother and Christine is disturbing. And Christine is not half so admirable a character as in Leroux's version. She's more like a spineless love slave than the brave, naive, and curiously ambivalent Christine I came to admire in the original.Another real problem with this book is that it comes dangerously close to condoning of Erik's violence because of his other redeeming qualities. In order to do that, the author made Erik a superman with unnatural talents in practically everything.Also, a previous reviewer said that the book was too Catholic-- I didn't feel it was Catholic enough. Leroux's lonely and virginal Christine would have never had sex out of wedlock (""Only my husband can tell me what to do!""). The entire last part of the book was just ridiculous. So... yeah. Read the original."
3,It's okay,"I won't argue with anybody who says that this piece of fan fiction is ""overwrought,"" ""full of purple prose,"" and ""nothing but a romance novel."" They're legitimate allegations, except for the last, and it's certainly not quality literature. However, the romantic teenager in me enjoyed Kay's interpretation of a magnetic, well-assured Erik.Of course, that's where the problem begins. Leroux's Erik is not sensual or self-confident... he's more than a bit mad, a genius, yes, but with a feverish, child-like quality to him. Kay's Erik was every inch of him a man--a man who knew what he wanted, and went after it.What I mean to say is, that Kay's novel is enjoyable. It's a guilty pleasure, it's a comfort book that you go back to whenever reality bites. But for Leroux purists, Kay doesn't seem to truly understand what Leroux's Erik was really about. Sadly, very few seem to (and no, Andrew Lloyd Webber is not one of them)."
3,Good plot but poorly written,"This book is very intersting for a fan of the Phantom of the Opera, but before trying it I recomment highly seeing the musical and reading the original by Gaston Leroux. The story told in this book detailes the life of The Phantom from his childhood and fills in the areas left blank by the above two works. While an interseting story, I must say that it is written in a childish, overly dramatic manner, with frequent failed attempts of power and majest which do not live up to the sweeping power of the musical or of the original. Like the Harry Potter books, it has an excellent plot but below-average writing style.My point: an interseting book, but first read the book by Leroux and see the musical. Don't let your first taste of the Phantom be this!"
5,"All I have to say is ""Wow""...","I am a huge fan of all things realted to the story of the Phantom of the Opera. I have read the original story many times, and a few other versions as well. This is far and away the best addition to the original. Awesome, emotionally packed, and just so good! I encourage anyone who is interested in the story of the Phantom to read this book."
5,Why is this book out of print?????,"I sincerely believe a publishing company should have jumped at the opportunity to reissue this book when the Phantom of the Opera movie came out last year. This telling of the phantom's tale is so touching and thorough, it far surpasses the original. Why, oh why, has no one reissued this book?I'm so glad I got my used hardcover before all of the used book seller decided to charge upwards of $100 per copy."
4,"Good, but not quite what I expected","This was an excellent book. It was a quick read, but I expected more about Erik and Christine. I should have realized from the reviews that his early life was going to be stressed. But, after multiple viewings of ALW's wonderful Phantom of the Opera movie, I wanted the majority to be about Erik and Christine. It was nice to see where Erik came from and what caused him to be the way he was, though. I just was expecting something else."
5,book review,"One of the best books i've ever read....If you ever want details behind the man in the mask in the famous play, then Phantom is for you. I can't recommend it highly enough."
5,A devastating experience,"This book is one of the few ""jewels"" one finds amongst modern literature. I first read it 8 years ago, and up till now i can't keep track of how many times i've re-read it!! I just lost count and didn't bother ever counting again! This book tells a heartrending tale that strips away all decoration...it simply displays before you the naked emotions of a very real man and his devastating love. Maybe we all have the preconception that sequels or books based on ""original stories"" are cxxp...but it would be a sin to stereotype this amazing tale. For those who love the Phantom and those who don't...let yourself experience the unbelievable emotion!!! For the first time, or again and again!!"
5,Best Book I Have Read,"I can't even explain how awesome this book is. If there were any book I would recommend to anyone, it is this one. I have read it many times and every time I pick it up I am moved to tears.The story of Erik's life is told by many of the characters perspectives as Erik is growing up. Very beautifully written in every aspect. If you are looking for a book full of beauty, love, and pain this is most definitely the book for you."
3,Interesting but dissappointing,I had found Ms. Kay's book good but quite disappointing. So much detail to Erik's beginning days on earth and little or nothing to his final ones. The book leaves the reader sad and angry. Surely his final end as a genius deserves more than alluding to what happend behind a closed door for a few days. The Requiems that Erik demanded for others did not occur for him. I would suggest reading the book but a need for closure to Erik's story is missing.
2,A kind of love that is spelled C-A-N-O-N D-E-A-T-H,"Is this book decently written? The first few chapters are pretty good. If you can get past the endless amount of angst, improbable infant achievements, poorly characterized characters, and sexy, sexy corpses, it's not soul hemorrhage inducing. The Persia chapter of the book really shines. It's after that that Susan Kay should have slapped a 'finis' in and sent it off to the publisher. It's a decent read, but certainly not better than the original in any way, shape or form."
5,"Tantalizing, Haunting, Unforgettable, And So Much More!","I first read Phantom by Susan Kay in July of last year, since then I have read this book four times unable to put it done and feeling as though I was reading a completely different story each time I start it over again. I feel as if I am in the story and when ever I finish, I always seem to say to myself, ""Poor, poor Erik."" The style Susan depicts the Phantom and his life is absolutely stunning and graphic but wonderful. If you like The Phantom of the Opera by Gaston Leroux (highly recommended) or Andrew Lloyd Webber's broadway musical, then you should deffinately read this book. I love this story of Erik's life so much more than any other version that I has seen or read before. It is so GREAT that it should be made into a movie. Just an idea."
3,Phantasy reborn,"I just can't give this more than a 3 star rating, however well written. This is a really interesting take on Erik's back story, and if taken for purely that, then its well worth a read. The main area that just doesn't lend itself to credibility is her timeline for Erik. There is just no way that Erik (born 1831 according to Kay) would be 50 yrs old for the culminating events of Phantom. Sorry, but that is stretching credibility way too far. Few people, especially someone like Christine (feather-headed though she may be) could have brought herself to bridge a 30 yr age gap. I can buy Eric at 29, even 35, but not 50. Even Leroux, with all his cryptic hints did not characterize Erik as 50 by the end of Phantom; unless I missed that bit in the 27 times reading his book, which is possible I guess, but unlikely.Phantom"
3,Great read,"Susan Kay is a terrific writer and her take on the Phantom story is a worthwhile read. I was disappointed in the end, however, which didn't strike me as credible. The Raoul character's patience rivals Mother Teresa's. Modern women may be turned off by Christine's passivity as she leaves her destiny to the men who love her. Still, I highly recommend the book."
5,This is the REAL classic !,"This book is so gripping I couldn't put it down. Leroux was a chore to read, a real bore and the main characters really irritated me, I didn't care about any of them. Raoul was a total wuss, weep, weep, sob, sob. I started to wonder if he was gay. Christine was an idiot and Erik little more than a gremlin.In Phantom the characters are so much more deep and compelling and the story just holds you spellbound. I even liked Raoul in this version.The book builds and builds to a wonderful conclusion. You don't need to be a phan to enjoy this book. If you appreciate well written literature you won't be disappointed. Worth every cent."
3,An okay book...,"This book is good but not great. The last part of the book when Christine enters the picture was poorly written, it seemed to me as if Kay got bored with the book at that point. And Kay kept changing POVs between Erik and Christine, which just doesn't work for the story.Kay gives an account of Erik's life, his childhood and how he grew up. But it annoyed me that she would add things to Erik's history that weren't even hinted in ""Leroux"". It's like she gave herself the license to completely make up a few events, specifically in Erik's childhood.So my advice either borrow this book from the library, or buy it paperback, a lot cheaper than hardcover (I did the mistake of buying this book hardcover, it's expensive. Leroux's phantom was cheaper and a far better read), read it, and form your own opinion about it. It's an okay book, just okay."
5,This is it!,"This book RULES!!!!!!! There are no ifs, ands or buts, this book is amazing! Within the first 40 pages I was in tears. People have complained this book is too unrealistic because of it's sexual content, but come on! It's not all that bad! It could have been a lot worse! I thought the book was absolutely delightful and I will probably never find a better book then this for Phantom ever again because it doesn't exsist! Kudos to Susan Kay!"
5,AMAZING!! BREATHTAKING!!,"I would rate this book 100 stars if I could! it was amazing and breathtaking. I read this book nonstop - literally. i read it during class (hehe), before bed, in the morning, and so on. I just couldn't put it down! I even have one of my friends reading it. They wanted 2 because I loved it so much. I would DEFINITELY reccommend this book to anyone! If you are a Phantom/Erik Phan, even if you aren't, do yourself a huge favor - READ THIS BOOK! It was totally breathtaking and romantic."
2,Stilted and Vague,"I was sorely disappointed in the author's style which made me give up on this book. After more than one hndred pages I remained put off by the choppy and disonnected writing. I kept feeling like I was not understanding all the characters were saying because every sentence seemed to have a hidden meaning and subtext. Perhaps if you are able to stay with it, this book might get better and be worth reading."
5,A Sunday Jew.,"Look this book is written for people who are truly avid readers, yes alot of characters to keep up with but if you choose the book to read then you new what a great deal of patience you was up against. The author done an excellent job as far as I am concern she gave me my money's wroth. If you don't like long and especially challenging books do not READ them and then try to fault the author of a great read. I feel that books as such maybe should come with a warning saying CAUTION not for fast and unable to keep up with an extreme amount of characters please do not attempt to read!! REMMBER this is just my opinion. I love the book but was ready to read only this book usually I am able to read 2-3 books at the same time but would not even try with this book."
1,Sunday Jews,"The book was well-reviewed, but I found it terribly disappointing. The characters are both unrealistic and unsympathetic, the book is stuffed with solecisms, particularly regarding Judaism, and the writing style is at best precious and at worst impenetrable."
4,"Difficult, but worthwhile","Getting into this book, which its long sentences (no, not really like Henry James--Calisher's style is not poetic, but is deeply probing and thoughtful) and many characters, is difficult. But the story of this family is really very absorbing. Making the two principal characters an archeologist and a philospher is a foil for the writer's style of questioning, analyzing, and reflecting on all aspects of family life, religion, culture, money-making, art.... But it does work. I related to the characters and to the emotional strength of the book and the family."
1,Thank god. I thought it was just me.....,"(I'm tickled to see these other reviews.)I tried. Really I did. But to no avail.Too many characters to keep track of. No discernable connection between them...even though they're supposedly in the same family! How did the author stay interested enough to tell this story?Knowing that this author was president of PEN and the American Congress of Letters (or whatever) makes me think that the Empress has no clothes. Or that she simply had a multi-book contract to fulfill and that because of her ""fame"" no one at the publisher had te balls to reject the manuscript....."
1,Not to be believed,"This is the worst writing I have seen in years. It is not just bad, it is gob-smackingly appalling. It beggars belief that people have not only succeeded in tolerating it, but that they actually like it. I didn't think writing like this ever saw the light of day after the 6th grade. Not even funny-bad - just dreadful."
2,"A reader in New York, N.Y.","I am heartened to see so many readers willing to disclose how awful this book is. The only way I got through it is by its being the only book I had on a 12 hour flight. There is not a true or credible character to be found in nearly 700 pages. I tolerate a wide variety of writing styles, but not ones that are deliberately opaque. There are pages of utter gibberish here. And honestly, the ""deep thoughts"" are just silly."
5,Great for the price,"This pad is perfect for the price. It's durable, made of quality material, attaches easily, and provides enough protection for my 4 boys when they play. I would definitely recommend it!"
2,don't buy,My mistake I thought it was like the one I bought for playstation that was so much fun. Its dark no intructions as were to go. It rapidly shows were scooby is suppose to go. Just don't die as must start all over. It says how to sneak past ghost but sneaking just dont seem to work.
3,Well..,"I'm 16 and my brother is older and BOTH of us can't beat this game. If your buying this for your kid, it's pretty hard."
5,Fantastic!,"This is one of the greatest albums ever put out into the world in my humble opinion. It sounds just as fresh as it did when it came out all these years later and will sound amazing in 20 more years time. Every song on this album is solid and well composed, Chris' vocals are on point and everything blends together like magic. More albums should be this good."
5,Soundgarden....doubt one of the elite,"After listening and becoming increasingly familiar with grundge music, their is no doubt that Superunknown is one of the best grundge cd's ever made and is, in my opinion, straight up one of the best cd's ever. My three favorites are ""Fell on Black Days,"" ""Day I Tried To Live,"" and the underrated ""4th of July."" Of course, the remaining tracks on this disc are nothing short of spectacular, and Soundgarden's old school style is better than anything Audioslave will ever come up with."
5,Soundgarden's masterpiece,"Words can't describe the greatest of this cd. I started listen to this cd when I was 9, im 17 now, and i still listen to this cd constantly. Go out and buy this cd now! I dont know what else to tell you, except that its one of the best cds ever."
3,Superunknown CD: Okay quality,"When I received the package and opened it, I thought it was in good condition but when I picked it up the front CD cover just fell off. It was cracked and there were actually pieces of plastic at the bottom of the package. I have to say I am disappointed in the condition of the case but so far the CD is playing fine which is what I mostly care about."
3,Not bad for a Seattle band,"Only two decent bands have ever came out of Seattle: Heart and Soundgarden. If you must listen to a grunge band, Soundgarden is it. If you must listen to a grunge album, Superunknown is it."
3,quite good!,it is better than badmotorfinger...the lyrics are quite dark and satanic...very good! the riffs could be better. like suicide and black hole sun as well as fell on black days are great songs! they bring me more children!
3,wow people have no understanding of the history of music,creed did not invent anything besides a new way to show how crappy a bunch of drunk losers can be. infact nirvana had an album out before all of those bands so you could say they invented grunge but im not really a nirvana fan this album is ok was not the first grunge album ever but it ok like i said
2,Boring and polished,"Well, this is a record I heard daily in the spring days of 1994, but now, let's say it's some of the records I don't want to let any of my friends know I have. After the excellent ULTRAMEGA OK (just the title says all) and the less excellent Badmotorfinger this must be considered as the complete sell-out! The only really cool track is Ben Shepherd's ""Half"". I can't help thinking of pop-grunge fourteen year old girls with pierced noses when I hear ""Black Hole Sun"". Sad."
1,Nightmare of a purchase unless you love thrash metal!!,Was shocked to be recommended this album after listening to & loving Sublime. Not at all in the same genre. Absolutely hated it. Skimmed through all the tracks in utter horror before giving it to my brother - sorry guys!
1,TERRIBLE!,They just copied Nirvana. It was a major rip-off. Dont buy it! Buy any of the other Nirvana cd's because they are all better than this cd!
4,What a voice! What a band!,"This is Soundgarden's most famous album and deservedly so. It is dark and moody, but has some upbeat stuff too. ""Fell on Black Days"" is my favorite on this one. Everything about it is excellent. It has the perfect balance that is so hard to find in many songs. ""Black Hole Sun"" is the mega-hit from this album. It is an excellent song which shows how beautiful Chris Cornell's voice can be (it also has a very original video). ""Spoonman"" is the other radio hit and is different than most of their songs. It has a great beat and some very cool drumming. ""The Day I Tried To Live"" is a very interesting song. The lyrics make it seem like someone is given a chance to live and they waste it. This is another screamer and features more of the signature tightness from the band. There are many other good songs on this album, but I feel these are the biggest standouts. Any fan of the grunge era owes it to themselves to get this. It is a prime example of the genre at its best."
5,THE BEST ALBUM FROM GRUNGE'S BEST BAND!!!!!!!,"There is a lot to say about this album. Soundgarden is defenitely at their best creatively in Superunknown. Soundgarden displays the variety and style of Led Zeppelin along with the dark riffs of Black Sabbath. Chris Cornell's lyrics are truly brilliant and easy to relate to. Without a doubt, their best yet. If you liked Temple of the Dog and are a true fan of grunge and hard rock, you'll love this album!!!!"
5,i was so cool i was a fool!,"when this album was released i was so fed up with grunge and seatle and all of its hype!my indie-rock music snob self was either discovering bands like sebadoh,rocket from the crypt and guided by voices or reminising of the pre-nirvana good ole days when bands like husker du,replacements,sonic youth,dinosour jr and the meat puppets ruled alt-rock.but i have to say that i was a fool to not have given this album more of a chance,it is one of the greatest hard rock albums of all time! 8 years later i have come to appreciate it.being a fan of 70's bands like sabbath,zeppelin,ufo,thinlizzy and grand funk railroad, i can hear all of the classic rock influences.so even if you are not a fan of gen x alt-rock but you may have liked 70's hard rock ,i recomend this album!"
5,a great album by one of the greatest bands ever,"Seven years later this album is already a classic in alternative hard rock, because this album never gets old. Every single song off this album is listenable and great. It contains many recognizeable hit radio singles: Fell On Black Days, My Wave, Black Hole Sun, The Day I Tried To Live, Etc. It also has songs such as Let Me Drown, Limo Wreck, Fresh Tendrils, and 4th Of July, which are unknown classics from the album. Kickstand is a very short, very fast, song that is also fun to listen to. The album ends with the epic Like Suicide; probably the best song off the album and by the band in general. The acoustic version is also great too. This album is a hard rock classic. That's all that needs to be said."
4,Superunknown? Should've been titled SuperKNOWN!,"Here is one of two REALLY good bands from Seattle that deserved the recoginition it got. While not your typical ""grunge"" band (they were more rock/metal if you asked me), they were still able to display the raw, electric talent that characterized them. For some reason, Chris Cornell reminds me of Robert Plant (based on the way he sings). Anyways, you have their popular songs like ""Black Hole Sun"", ""My Wave"", ""Fell On Black Days"", and ""Spoonman"". And then you have their experimental songs like ""Head Down"" and ""Half"". The majority of the tracks have that electric, psychedelic vibe. Overall, this album rocks! It's a shame they broke up a long time ago. The only other good band from the Pacific Northwest was Nirvana (which also broke up due to unforeseen, tragic circumstances...you know what I mean :-( ). At least we'll have Soundgarden's (and Nirvana's) music to listen for years to come."
5,The finest hard rock album of the decade,"As the 90's comes to an end, every magazine is doing polls on the ""Best albums of the decade,"" and so on and so forth. Why is ""Nevermind"" always number 1? Music shouldn't be a popularity contest, it should be an art form. This album is unlike any rock album I have ever heard. It almost bridges the gap between progressive rock, and punk. ""Black Hole Sun"" is an amazing song, but the real highlight is ""Like Suicide"". This 7 mintue long opus is one of the best songs Cornell has ever written, and the guitar solo at the end, though not technically difficult, is amazing. This album as a whole is an album that should put Soundgarden into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It offers more than any Zeppelin album (minus ""Stairway""), and it is far better than anything to ever come out of Seattle in the past 2 decades. Soundgarden was an amazing band, and I don't think any other band could have pulled off such an album as gracefully, and as perfectly."
5,The 90s rocked!!,"having to admit that I was introduced to soundgardern through Audioslave, because of Chris cornell, it is a great rock band from the 90s!! hit after good hit, that makes the listener beg for more!! one of the best albums I have ever heard!!"
5,The best 1990s band from the Seattle scene,"Superunknown is a killer CD. Soundgarden's music clearly shows its Led Zeppelin/Black Sabbath influences but always sounds original. This is a driving, complex release and time has not diminished its impact."
