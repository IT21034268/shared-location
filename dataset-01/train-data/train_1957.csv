3,Just okay,"There are good discussions that will stimulate meditational reflection but there isn't the indept exposure that I expected. Analyse the word, give us a picture of the environment then and dig deep into the word. There is a lot of Boice opinion and a feel too much social discourse. I discovered later that the book is a collection of radio sermons, that explains it.Do not misunderstand me, Boice's work is good, but it isn't exactly what I was looking for. It didn't cause me to raise my eyebrow cos of some academic or historical or language insight."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"Do not buy from Sony. We returned this camera to Sony 2X to have it fixed. Each time it was $170 to get it ""fixed"". It is already broken again! Terrible customer service! We used to buy everything Sony. Not anymore!!!"
5,great,"I would have liked a comparative report on this model and the ""DSCH7"" one. There's a difference in price and I actually think they are pretty much the same!"
4,Nice camera,"This is a nice camera, you may find it useful if you are interested in learning to take better pictures."
4,Sony Cybershot 15x Superzoom,"I really love this camera. I have owned Cybershot H1, H5 and H7 and this is the best so far. What to I like most? Let me list the pluses: antishake, 15x zoom [!!], great colors, face focusing in automatic mode, full manual mode, speed and multiple shot capability - no significant time lag.The only significant complaint might be with the lack of a raw image format without any error correction [or at the very least a way to control the degree of error correction/compression.] So far this limitation has not been a problem, but I can see a point in the future when this may limit the size of the images I print. Seems like a simple request to have NO error correction/compression as an optional choice."
1,Camera is defective-Sony Customer Service is HORRIBLE,"My husband bought me this camera as my first Mother's Day gift this past May for our then 2 month old daughter. When we had the first pics developed, we noticed yellowing in the shots but attributed it to the store who developed them. My husband decscribes it as pixilated yellowing and I say vein like. Hard to describe unless you see it. After this happened with an additional batch of photos, I contacted Sony who had me send it to one of their repair centers. We had to pay shipping costs. The camera came back over a week later and the problem was still there. I called Sony and they refused to replace the camera and want me to send it to ANOTHER repair center.We have lost out on precious moments that we won't get back. We currently are disputing this with our credit card company.They do not stand by their products and I will not buy Sony again."
3,good camera/not crazy about seller,"I had this camera before and it was stollen. I did buy a newer camera and it just wasn't a nice as this one. They do not sell this camera New anymore, so I had to buy it used. Only used this one once so far and seems to be okay. The seller was rude when I sent her a message asking a few questions about missing parts and if she had a return policy. She did not have one which was fine, I just had to purchase the parts directly from SONY, which did cost me more money and some I happened to have already because I already owned this exact camera before."
4,Good Camera but,"The H9 is a great point & shot camera, but the image quality and the User Interface are just poor."
2,"Overspecified, with too many compromises","This camera has a great zoom range but, on the other side, the lens' quality seems to be below average, with a lot of distortion, chromatic aberrations, noticeable corner softness.Also, the sensor/processor combo seems to be a step backwards from previous models, in terms of image quality. The pics look soft and there are a lot of visible compression artifacts, due to the lack of fine quality mode.All of this translates in poor images, which may look good resized at 5 megapixels, or in small prints, but then, why would you want an eight megapixel camera that only delivers pictures with quality on par with 5 mp cameras, from 2 or 3 years ago. A Huge step backwards for sony, if you ask me."
3,Maybe my expectations were too high,"My purpose of buying this camera is to shoot nocturnal animals with adequate budget. First time I saw DSC-H9 on the web, I thought this was the one. This camera must allow me to take IR shots with no difficulty.But I was wrong. All that in the photo I had taken were gloomy ambiguous. I tried a lot of things, and finally decided to buy an IR flashlight to assist my shooting.As a point-and-shoot digital camera, the resolution is poor compared to today's standard."
5,Unbelievable Cost Increase,"Bought my DSC H9 about 4 years ago because I knew my mother was on borrowed time.Wanted to get as many quality pictures of her as I could.This camera has taken some memorable pics of a beautifulwoman.Lost the battle june of 2011.I have about 500 perfect photos to share with my siblings.Onlyhave 1 question,why is this camera now priced at roughly 3 times what I paid for mine?Realizeprices go up but 300 percent?"
4,A Very Good Camera,"This is probably as good a camera an amateur photographer needs. Everything seemed to be just right, and the amount of time it takes to learn how to use it is very short. The steady shots are just superb.The only thing I found missing on it is the ability to automatically print the date on the pictures. I would call this a perfect camera if it had that ability."
2,"Okay, but major design flaw","Have had the DSC H9 for 3 months. A good day camera for small hands. Large hands(thumb pad)bump control button. Light, easy to use, short day shutter lag. Long list of features. Major design flaw: 72mm funnel shaped filter adaptor ring sits in front of flash. 50 out of 50 pictures have half moon shadow due to flash blockage. Without adaptor ring, pictures are fine, no shadow, but no lens protection. Night shutter/flash lag very poor. SLOW. If the object/subject moves, you will not get it. Sony not responsive to flaw issue. Cylindrical adaptor not available."
5,Marvelous for the price!,This is much more than I expected! I have used it several times and it is great. So many features and ease of use...for under $500 and Sony is a great company for support. I especially love the tilt screen which is not found on any other new model..it really helps with the Florida sun always out..at least most of the time.I can't find anything bad to say so far...my friends are all amazed at the pictures and video it produces.Thanks Sony for this great camera.Marji Stone
5,"Sony Cybershor DSC H9, Case and Sony 4 GB memory Stick","A very good camera, high precision and easy to use. It's recomendable to all who wishes to have a digital camera. The case that come with, is very practical to carry or to store the camera. And the Sony 4GB Memory Stick Pro Duo facilitates to the user to get a great number of photographs and transfer them to a PC or Notebook in a easy form."
3,Good and Bad,"Nice zoom, but difficult to focus when zoomed all the way. Vibration indicator kept flashing, so maybe you need a tri-pod. I also found the controls confusing, having to traverse to the digital menu for most everything. Wide angle lens blocks flash. I returned mine for a Canon G9 and I'm MUCH happier now!"
5,I am very pleased with my new camera.,This camera is everything that I thought it would be. I have not experienced any of the problems that have been brought up. The buttons are well positioned. The lens does wonderful things. I am able to take detailed shots of birds that I have never achieved before. I did not expect it to be a DSLR and it is not but it is an excellent point and shoot with a magnificent zoom capability.
1,Great but not great,"This book is a lot of fun. It's meant as research, but every single conclusion is ridiculous. So if you like that, this book is top notch. If you want facts, look somewhere else."
1,Just a warning...,"This book is laughable. If you buy this book, do not do so for serious research. It is nothing more than a comparative dictionary, and the ""similarities"" the author points out are ridiculous. It makes for a great read, but only because you'll be laughing the entire time."
3,Good For The Price I Paid,"(...). It's got hardcore matches and bra and panties matches, but they should have had more matches and less storylines. But for 5 bucks, what do you expect."
2,This DVD [is bad]!,"I would have to say that the only good moment of this DVD is the Trish Stratus- Vince Mcmahon angle, and that is why I gave it two stars instead of one.Where's The Rock? Where's Triple H? Where's The Hardy Boyz?This DVD [..is bad..]!"
3,Action!...Maybe,"Ok I'm gonna shoot with you on this. Parts of this video are well done, while others are poorly done.Subjects:Hardcore Title: some good matches and some funny spots. Pretty good.Bra & Panties: ok, this would have better if we could finish the match without interference. But fubby.Mr. McMahon/Trish Stratus love angle: This was good. Good clips, great action.Stone Cold gone Bad: This was a low point in Austins career. You knew in your heart he wasn't into it. This also introduced the catchphrase ""WHAAT??"". Some good clips/Invasion: ok we start the invasion bbut don't finish it, Some good matches and angles.Spike/Molly love angle: This was a wonderfully done storyline. It made you remember the olden days.All in all, a good video, But instead of Action! It should have been best of Raw and Smackdown 2001."
1,Interesting Man Awful Documentary,No one seems to mention how awful shot and Produced this Documentary is. From the lighting to the boring and overly long interviews this is a documentary in need of some good editing and a director who knows something about making an interesting film. It appears the director has no idea how to shoot an interesting and decent looking documentary. Just pointing a camera at poorly lit people and letting them ramble on with no editing does not make for an interesting film. It is said that a great teacher can bring alive even the most boring subject matter and vice versa. This film takes an interesting man and a fascinating time and make it into a complete snoozefest.
2,Makes Me Think Who Cares!,"I turned this documentary off half way through. I didn't find it interesting and I didn't enjoy the interviews. I bought it for my cousin who was doing a term paper on Jack Kerouac and he wondered after watching half the DVD if he wanted to write on such a boring person. But, anyone who knows anything about Kerouac knows he was not boring, he was facsinating! Look elswhere if you want to know more. As a matter of fact try reading a book by or about him."
4,"Stratfords ""Promise Her Anything""- Great Track!","Hearing the Stratfords again makes it well worth it! One of the best groups to come out of Evander Childs HS in the Bronx, in the early 60's.This record is a current revival hit in Germany!"
4,I love this book,"I read this book weeks ago and certain lines and gem-like details still stick in my mind: ""the business with the seaweed;"" the rash in the shape of the Virgin; throwing a deck of cards out of a car speeding through the sodden Irish countryside. Is there anyone who hasn't done something like this or wanted to? Ridiculous, almost cruel, but what a satisfying gesture of female defiance. You should read this book because it is smarter than most!"
3,Hard to keep up,"Yes, they're good dance steps...if you can keep up. She doesn't explain what she's going to do before she does it, and, as you can imagine, hip hop music is a bit fast-paced. So, its a bit difficult to keep up with her."
2,Overused Plot,"To placate her critically ill grandfather, Lisle agrees to marry Jake. She abhors him for taking control of the family business and he detests her for the party girl that he thinks she is.I'm sure they work out their differences in the long run, but I lost interest early on and didn't even finish the book.I've read other books by Sara Craven that kept my attention, so I think this was just an early effort of hers that seems fairly ho hum."
2,The other reviewer hit the nail on the head,"Definitely a mere 2 or even 1 star effort, the worst fault of A BAD ENEMY is that it totally lacks any basis or reasonable motivation for the happy-ever-after eventually reached by the hero and heroine.The couple spend nearly the entire book fighting and sniping at each other, although (par for the course for a Harlequin romance) they are sexually attracted and some kisses and caresses are exchanged. About halfway through the story, suddenly, the heroine thinks, Oh, my gosh, I'm in love with him --(although their acquaintance is approximately one month, if that, and they've spent all their time fighting). She feels that her chances with the hero are hopeless (!) so she passively runs away, instead of breaking off her engagement to him face-to-face.The story was completely unbelievable, and unbelievably annoying. Wooden unsympathetic characters in a silly story. Can't recommend."
1,Worse than nothing,"Do not buy this. If you have it already, do not use it. The software is aawful and will tranfer thousands of useless files if you are not careful. It automatically ""helps"" you by recreating your file directory structure - what a mess. I managed to avoid having my settings completly messed up, but still had to spend hours deleting files and directories."
1,I don't recommend this product,"I have a very complex laptop computer set up, with about 50 different applications on it, plus nearly 50 GB of data. I thought this tool might help in the migration from my old laptop to my new laptop.The instructions first tell you to install all of the application on the new computer to match your old computer, and then begin the move.When I did this, I ran into these issues:1) Even using a network connection (the fastest supported) the data move took about 6 hours.2) Some data was not moved over that I wanted to move, and some data that I did not want to move was moved anyway.The above confused some of my applications and I had to reinstall many of them.Your only choice whether to select what to move and not to move is based on file extension name. This is not a very granular way to move applications and data. It should be based on specific applications, which this program seems to know little about.It is faster to do the migration manually."
1,Uch!,"What happened to the good old BSC? BSC Friends Forever is awful! Ann, why do you even bother to call it ""BSC"" Friends Forever anymore? They never ever ever baby-sit anymore so that's very misleading. The accurate name would probably be The Pessimistic Whiny Low-Life Teenybopper Club."
4,It was almost good.,I'm sorry that Logan and Mary Anne broke up because they have been together for so long. I knew the big breakup was coming sooner or later. Logan was being too overprotective of Mary Anne and she got tired of it. I wouldn't blame her. I can't wait for the next one.
5,ITS ABOUT TIME!,"This was an excellent book, i really enjoyed reading it. It was about time mary anne ditched logan and became her own person, i think mary anne is the best, i can really identify with the way she is and how she feels about logan. Still it will be a bit sad to see the best bsc couple so far dissapear i am sure the future will give mary anne great opportunities and a very interesting life."
1,what happened to mary anne?,mary anne was so bitter. she used to be nice and would never hurt some one . though she was standing up for herself i just didn't like how she acted .in the orignal bsc she was my favorite charater and i'v read almost all her books i was so shocked she had the guts to break up with logan.anyway i don't recamend this book to any one who was ever a BSC fan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Absolutely necessary for travel to Panama!,"We spent New Year's Eve in Bocas del Toro on the Island of Colon. There was no information available except for The Lonely Planet Guide bought by a Canadian couple and shared with thirty or so lost travelers. The Lonely Planet Guide got us through del Toro, back to David and to the border of Costa Rica without a hitch. An absolute necessity for anyone traveling in Panama!"
3,panama guide lacks substance,"while this guide is accurate in terms of what hotels and restaurants exist, it is only relatively good with prices. Be forwarned that bus scedules in the guide are only a rough estimate, do not rely on Mr. Doggett's schedule as gospel. Also, Mr. Doggett leaves out much needed detais and descriptions about the FEEL of each place, and what a stay there will actually be like. for example, the market in el VAlle is described as the best in the country, so we literally planned our entire trip around being there on a Sunday. Only, Mr. Doggett fails to describe it in the grander scheme of markets. In comparison to markets in Ecuador, El VAlle was a great disappointment. Before you go to Panama, talk to someone's whose been there. Also, be warned that fruits and vetables are virtually impossible to come across out of the city."
5,The Perfect Ending,"This, the final of Yehuda Amichai's works, lays to rest a life and career memorable to no end. Open Closed Open is about the Israel that is and has been -- tensions that have not faded -- complexities that have not eroded -- and loves that remain in spite of it all. It is, in every sense, a book of poetry, of poetics unequalled. Please read Open Closed Open."
5,Great DVD,"I am very impressed with Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams. It is one of the best Yoga DVDs that I have ever seen. It is very easy to follow along unlike a lot of other DVD's I have seen. I also liked that each segment presented different material so you get an amazing amount of excellent instruction on this one DVD. After being disappointed by so many DVD's in the past, Jane's program really delivers an excellent program. It is well worth buying and I will be recommending it to others."
2,Disappointing,"I'm in my 50's and largely sedentary and wanted something to improve my balance and help with my anxiety levels. The routine is good, the informal background is fine, but the quality of the recording reminds me of a poorly made 1970's home movie. There is hissing noise in the background throughout and Jane's high-pitched voice is anything but soothing. I would not recommend this to anyone.If you're looking for a good beginner DVD try Yoga: Gentle Practice with Zyrka Landsijt. I ordered it at the same time as the above. Zyrka's voice is wonderfully soothing, there are 9 different sessions to help you progress, and the quality of the recording is professional."
5,Great DVD for travelers,"As I travel frequently for work I have been searching for a long time for a yoga DVD that helps me stretch out the kinks of the day & is easy to follow. This is the one. I purchased this DVD several weeks ago & have been very happy with it. The gentle yoga is perfect for my arthritis & helps soothe tired muscles. It is also easy to do in a small area, like a hotel room. Thanks Jane Adams!"
5,Gentle Yoga with Jane Adams,"This is a GREAT DVD. I'm in my late 50s and my husband is 70. We do this DVD together and wish we had started years ago. It is easy to follow and we can see the difference in our flexibility, strength and balance. A bonus is that I see an improvement in my posture. If you are looking for a yoga DVD that you will enjoy and one where you will notice an improvement in your body and state of mind, this is it."
4,It is what it says!,"This is an excellent yoga program for us older folks who aren't as flexible as we used to be. The DVD is divided into segments beginning with a short introduction segment. After watching that once you can do whatever segment(s) you want to do each day. Segments are a 20min. warm-up, 33 min. balancing, 13 min. lower body, 20 min. upper body, and a 7 min. relaxation. The reason I gave it 4 stars is the quality of the video is home-movieish. At one point on the warm up you can even hear a plane or truck go by and the voice quality is echoey. Other than that, it is a good ""gentle yoga"" workout."
5,Love it!,I have a lot of pain throughout my body and as I age any exercise that involves impact does more harm than good. This DVD lets me add body movement to my daily regiment of walking and light weights. I overdid the first day and quickly learned which moves I need to increase and which to limit. Even when I am not watching it I can do moves wherever it is convenient and I feel I need a stretch.
5,Fit senior,"This is a great video. I am 71 and find it a bit taxing, but will stick with it. It is very rewarding to get through the routines."
5,For beginners or those less flexible.,"This DVD is a great beginning for someone who has not exercised in awhile or someone who is older. The ideal is to go from no exercise to some exercise and I think other DVDs might be too challenging and those watching it might give up. Whether a person decides to stay at this level or move on, it's a SAFE place to start."
5,Nino Ferrer's best,This CD brings back memories of 60's dance parties. Back then songs actually told a story and by listening to them we could learn some words in a foreign language. Love this CD. The sound is in very good quality.
1,CHILD'S BIKE,"This is a Child's Bicycle. Not For Adults.My Wife saw it online, looked cute. I bought it for her.When it arrived I could tell immediately it was not an Adults bicycle.I put it together and sure enough, it's good for a little girl age 10-13."
5,Great bike for petite ladies,"After reading all the reviews and calling Forge with questions I decided to take the plunge sight unseen. I had been looking for a bike to fit my 5 foot frame for a few months and was about to purchase one at twice the price of this one on sale!After I spent two hours trying to put it together I called Forge for help got voice mail and just had a pro put it together for me. I have since received 3 return phone calls from Forge including one offering me a credit towards my bill for a pro putting the bike together.Forge is a great company, super helpful answering all my many questions (bike weight is approximately 30#)and getting back to me within 24 hours.As someone else said, the bike is a great coppery brown color, the seat is fairly comfortable and the 24"" wheels make for a great bike for short people."
5,Best Bike I've Ever Had,"This bike is definitely the best bike I have ever owned or ridden. It's the perfect size - I am only 5 foot tall, so to get a bike with 26"" wheels was a definite out. It rides well on the street, and it's comfortable. I feel like I could travel the world with it. If you are looking for a good street bike, this one is definitely it."
1,I don't have received this order.,I am being waiting for this movie and at this time (almost two month) I don't have received it. Please. I need information about this.Dalia
5,RVD!,That's all you need to know. He is the FUTURE of wrestling.MATCHES: WWF Championship Stone Cold vs Kurt AngleWCW Championship The Rock vs Booker TWWF Hardcore Championship RVD vs Jeff HardyWWF & WCW Tag Team Championship Undertaker & Kane vs DDP & KanyonWWF Intercontinental Championship Lance Storm vs EdgeWWF Light Heavyweight & WCW Cruiserweight Championship Tajiri vs XpacSix Man Tag APA & Spike vs Dudleyz & TestPlus many more exiting matches.
2,Ehh.......................,Lance Storm Vs. Edge - ** 1/2Dudley Boyz & Test Vs. APA & Spike Dudley - ****X-Pac Vs. Tajiri - ***Chris Jericho Vs. Rhyno - **Jeff Hardy Vs. RVD - **Undertaker & Kane Vs. DDP & Kanyon - *****Stone Cold Vs. Kurt Angle - *Booker T Vs. The Rock - ** 1/4
3,not bad,"This was a not bad PPV overall. True, there aren't any over-hyped, popular WCW stars (Sting, Goldberg.. etc etc..) but, it is well worth owning.But the real action is at streetbrawls.com Never, in my long wrestling-watching life, would I thought I would ever see WCW/ECW vs the WWF. The RVD (Rob Van Dam) vs. Jeff Hardy match is a classic if you ask me. The bra and panties tag match too! >=) Two of many reasons to own this one of a kind."
4,Summerslam 2001 Review,On a scale of one to ten I would give Summerslam 2001 a 7.5. It was solid but it really could have been more if a few things had not happened. Summerslam 2001 was a big improvement over the disappointing Summerslam 2000 event. This event cannot come close to equaling the excellent Summerslam 98 and Summerslam 99 events. ....
3,this pay per view was good but not great,1st match lance storm vs edge winner edge. 2nd match apa and spike dudlay vs dudly boys and test winners dudlay boys and test. 3rd match x-pac vs tajiri winner x-pac. 4th match chris jericho vs rhyno winner chris jericho. 5th match rvd vs jeff hardy wnner rvd. 6th match kane and undertaker vs kanyon and ddp winners undertaker and kane. 7th match kurt angle vs steve austin winner kurt angle. 8th match the rock vs booker t winner the rock.
2,Not the wwf at its best,"This was a ok video the ladder match and jerico vs rhyno were decent.BUT THE OTHER MATCHES WERE TERRIBLE.Angle got messed up badly by austin and was about to win but he got [messed] over.I was waiting for this cage match to get good but it didnt.The rock vs booker T was pretty [bad] too,because I dont like the rock or booker T, if anything I would want booker T to win.DO NOT BUY RENT IT ONLY!!!!!!!!"
4,best ppv since wm 17,"1.edge vs. lance storm-great technical match, and got the crowd going. 8/102.apa/spike vs. dudlyz/test- okay for a six man tag, spike takes a cool bump through a table. 6/103.xpac vs. tajeri-good match, and thats suprising considering x-pac was in the match but i guess tajiri can make anybody look good. 7/104.taker/kane vs. ddp/kanyon- boring, taker and kane suck, ddp is okay and kanyon sucks. this match couldnt be saved. 4/105.rvd vs. jeff hardy- great ladder match, had a ton of high spots. 10/106.austin vs. angle- another great match, angle gets out of 3 stunners, and just a great technical match, both guys did a good job, however the ending is sorta screwey. 9 and a half/107.booker t. vs the rock- okay match, nothing amazing. but it was cool to see the rock back. 7/10"
1,I want 2 c Edge vs Lance Storm,I heard so many excellent reviews about the match many rate it as a four star match saying it was one of the best opening matches in a long time I can't wait to see this match lance storm was widely considered as a great worker who never had the chance to shine in the wwf because of his size while edge was beginning to show the wwf he was capable of having 4 star outings with above average wrestlers like kurt benoit and guerrero
4,I think it is a good quick workout,I like it . It is not a hard core workout but if you have physical problems that make it to hard to do most workouts then this is a good one to do. Use it at least once a week for a mixture into my weekly workout.
1,WORST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you need to repair your credit, don't look here. The book if 300 pages, but only 25 pages really pertain to fixing your credit. The rest of the book is telling of different court cases and a copy of the Fair Credit Report that spans 125 pages of useless info. Please don't waste your time or money.... This was terrible. This jim shapiro should be ashamed of himself for actually charging for this."
1,An utter and complete joke,Please don't waste your time. This book is written like a poor college exam paper- HUGE type TRIPLE spaced.It is written this way because the author has nothing to say- except to sell you on calling him for more help.An internet search will give you more help fixing your credit. AVOID!!
1,Fell apart,"I bought this belt for my daughter for her birthday. It fell apart after about a month, started cracking then broke apart where the holes were."
2,simplistic feminist fluff,"This book basically covers the history of women using frame drums theorized by viewing artifacts and pictoral references from past 2200 years of civilized societies. There is no mention of tribal drumming or theories discussed of women using other types of drums. Plus you get wasted pages of author's own diatribe about her and her friends spiritual enlightment from forming a drumming group. It's junk like this that gives christian fundamentalists fodder for saying new-age/neo-pagan followers are nothing but feminists trying to rewrite history.The pluses for this book are it has plenty of b/w pictures, and the cover flaps can be used as bookmarks if you can't finish this lightly fleshed out summary in one sitting."
5,Very important for my research in shamanism.,This is basilar book for female shamanism. In Italy don't have a similar works. I very very like it. thanks.
5,The Beat of Different Drummers,"This book made a major change in my life as a woman & a drummer. Filled with photos of funereal friezes, statuettes & bas relief of women holding frame drums or tambourines from centuries & centuries ago before written history, this is the telling of one woman's journey along her spiritual path & the discoveries she made. A lovely lyrical effort & one I eagerly recommend. It will change your life!"
5,Excellent Book. Exciting and Dramatic,"I found an old, ragged copy of this book at a garage sale a while back. I read it and LOVED it. It sparked my love for reading again, and also sparked my interest in Andre Norton. I really want to find a copy in mint condition to add to add to my bookshelf."
5,Excellent!,"The Ossipov performances are flawless and the music will give you happy feet. You won't be able to sit still during ""Kalinka."" The waltzes are especially beautiful when played on balalaikas. They stayed away from the overdone stuff like ""Moscow Nights"" and ""Song of the Volga Boatmen."" Many of these I had never heard before. You should add this to your collection."
3,Too Small,I have found that all the card dies are much smaller than they look in the pictures...more the size of little gift tags. It would be helpful if the dimensions of the finished cards were listed.
4,Good for younger children than listed,"My three year old is in love with Angelina and puzzles. I gave this a shot despite it being listed for much older children. Because the pieces can be matched to pictures in the tray, with a little help, she is truly enjoying doing the puzzles. The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the pieces fit a little bit too snugly together -- the main source of frustration for her. Don't be scared off by the the listed age range if your littler one loves Angelina."
3,Puzzle Box Set,"The age description is the reason I only gave this puzzle box set 3 stars. The puzzles are beautiful and would be wonderful for 2-4 year olds. I purchased this set for my 5 year old and it just ""too pre-school"" for a child this age. I do highly recommend it for your pre-schooler Angelina fan!"
2,MORE ABOUT CNN THAN 9/11,"I just finished watching this DVD from the library. I have been looking for one that shows minute by minute details of what happened that day. This DVD jumps around a lot, which makes it a bit confusing as to the flow of that whole day. A lot of pats on the back for CNN but not at all what I was looking for. It's not a bad account, just seemed to jump around way too much.I also saw National Geographic's Inside 9/11. A 2 DVD set. One disc about the events leading up to 9/11 (not what I want) and one disc that gives minute by minute coverage of that day. (this is what I want). If I can find this 2 DVD set for the price of 1 DVD, I'll be happy. But the CNN DVD, I have no use for it."
3,"Good, but not great.","Excellent footage of the attacks, but I was hoping for a play by play of what was happening jjust before and the initial shock. They did NOT have a detailed initial interruption of the first plane hitting. I wanted to see regular expressions of the anchors to the surprise look at 8:46am.I was hoping for more of the actual day than the aftermath of the attacks. This is a PG rating of what they really showed on Septemeber 11. I was home on September 11 and saw the graphic violence that went on and this tape really doesn't cover it.Good, but not enough of what really went on."
5,Beautiful DVD about a horrible event,"CNN did an amazing job with this DVD. This topic is not an easy one to work with, but they pulled it off beautifully. They took very sensitive footage and turned it into a piece that not only recounts that day, but that honors those who lost their lives and those who helped save thousands of lives on that horrible day. I am glad I bought this DVD - each time I watch this it helps me appreciate life and makes me love America even more."
2,"If you are looking for a real documentary, this is not it","The editor decided that I don't want to see how the plane crashes into WTC, or how people jump from windows, so, he cut pretty much all of that. Instead, there is a plenty of news people's talking into camera about where they were at the time and what they were thinking, plus a bunch of stuff about anthrax to pad the little footage that was left."
3,cnn america rembers,"DONOT DO NOT DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT THRU ""EXCLUSICE"" THIS SHIPPER IS ONE BIG PAIN IN THE NECK. TOOK ALMOST A MONTH FOR PRODUECT TO DILIVER. EMAILS WENT UNANSWERED. WAS TOLD THEY SHIPPED ON 4-24-O9. GOT PACKAGEON 5-4-09. WITH A POSTMARK OF 5-01-09. WORD TO THE WISE DO NOT ORDER FROM EXCLUSIVE. IF NOT FOR PROBLEM WITH SHIPPER WILL GIVE IT 5 STARS"
4,Unbelievable but America still needs to learn..,"I still remember the day when I it happened. This DVD will bring you back to the moment it took place. Well edited and good conditions of shots. But it kind of make you think that ""Were there any others besides whites?"" It seems like everyone whos been interviewed were non colored folks. I know we can do way better than this now. Things like that happens for reasons. I thought our country had learned something. However it's a good DVD to have and show your kids later."
1,Let The Media Blind You From The Truth,"I am on a mission. I am out to find un doctored video of what happen that day. In this edition of America Remembers is media hog wash. All of the impacts of the planes have been removed so that the victims and the american people are blinded by what really hit those towers.Although they show 1 to 2 impacts of planes, this stripped down version of the real events hides the truth.In this dvd no reports of the hundreds of eye witness accounts that reveal many explosions going on at the twin towers before and after the ""planes"" hit.There is so much left out of the dvd that i decided to compare it to the first dvd.The differences clearly show that a lot more needed to be edited before the public figures out, what really happened that day.This dvd is a one sided slap in the face to victims and Americans in general.Everyone that reads this should call or write cnn and tell them we want the original dvd. Not this government version of events of mass murder."
5,Great Documentary,I want my children to remember what happened on that horrible day; this dvd will greatly help. The events of September 11th are well documented from beginning to end. I especially liked the fact that CNN did not try to politicize anything-- they just told the story based on the facts. Well worth the price.
3,"Slow, interesting, pricey","Episodes 1 and 2 are slow, they are laying out the plot; 3-5 are an improvement. This series is better than the PBS version but I have to seriously question whether or not they are worth $4.99 each."
2,probably needs revision,"i admire the author and have read many of her articles; however, IMHO this book is too old now (2000) so will contain outdated info. if and when it is revised I would consider it."
2,Please be careful,"Because many natural remedies are ancestors to our modern pharmacopia, care must be taken with all drugs you give your pet. Please use these books carefully and under the supervision of your veterinarian. There is a reason why we are required to attend four years of post-undergraduate medical school in order to prescribe drugs and make medical decisions. All animals are complex organisms who vary widely among species and individuals. Drugs and herbal remedies that may be safe and effective in humans can kill cats and dogs. These species variations are not well understood, especially with regards to herbal medications. For example, onions can be deadly to cats, as can Tylenol (a drug that we feel is safe even for human children). Please don't leave your common sense at the (e)bookstore door. Saving money on veterinary care by using a book may cost you the life of your pet."
1,Inaccurate facts,"I was disappointed in this book. In the first few pages I found several inaccuracies, i.e., grapes and raisins shown as people food recommended for dogs. These two foods are highly toxic to dogs. One of my clients nearly lost their dog due to a box of raisins he raided from their trash. Who knows what other inaccuracies there are in the book. After seeing those, I am afraid to try recipes for home cooked food for my dog. Nor am I willing to try any of his recommended natural remedies. I am a professional pet-sitter and certified in pet first aid. I do not recommend this book."
2,Outmoded Training Advice - stick to health please!,"I wish the author had stuck to the topic of natural health care. Her chapters on dog training promote outdated methods. Reading Baumann's description (in interview format) of her own methods and her misinformation about positive reinforcement methods forces me to lower my rating of this book as a resource for the average owner. This is undoubtedly the problem with attempting an ""encyclopedia"" approach, but as a serious researcher the author should've done better. I won't be ordering this book for my store."
3,Travel size?,"This dryer works well, but it is not travel size, it is a full size dryer with a folding handle, so don't expect a small size dryer to arrive."
2,Not what I had wanted...,"The item was much bigger and heavier than I expected, and did not dry hair so well. In addition, the retractable cord on my piece was not doing a very good job of retracting. The first hair dryer I bought after a year of borrowing hair dryers from roommates and so disappointing! I wouldn't recommend it as there are probably much better hair dryers at this price."
2,Kind of big,"The hairdryer is fairly heavy and hard to hold in one hand because of the weight but also because of how big around the handle is. Given I used this for travel, it also took up more of the 50 lb baggage limit that the airline gave me. It did work great on 240 voltage though and did a good job performance-wise. Would I buy it again? No."
4,Great for travel,"This hair dryer is perfect for everyday use as well as for travel. I love that it folds up, and the retractable cord is also convenient. I was able to bring it with me to Europe and didn't have any problems. Plus, it dries quicker than any others I've tried!"
5,Super Sucker DVD,This is one of those cult stupid/funny classic films in the same category as Ghost Busters. A great movie to watch when you just want to laugh.
1,Truly disgusting.,"I like Mr.Daniels' acting, he's got a great range of ability. Why he chose to do this movie is beyond me. It's about women prefering to have 'relations"" with thier vaccums instead of their husbands. yuck! After loving Escanaba in da Moonlight, we were very disappointed."
5,Looks deceptively simple,"I bought this 3 years ago, and have come to thoroughly enjoy it. Especially when I want a real challenge. The tile choices aren't the greatest, but you get over that in the challenges you'll face in many of the games. Some of the games have layers to them that won't allow you to match the top pieces until certain other pieces have been removed. When you start to play this game, set an alarm or have someone come and force you away from it. It is VERY ADDICTIVE and you'll find yourself playing the same layout over and over trying to beat your own scores."
2,Niche market,"Run-of-the-mill advice tailored for practicing Christians only. Having a relationship with God is good (no offence to you atheists out there) but considering that perfectionists procrastinate due to paralyzing fear of failure, can you picture them having developed the most important personal relationship in and out of their lives?"
4,The Language of American Art,"I love John Updike's essays. His perspicacious critical writing is, more often than not, a joy to explore. However, I have to agree with a previous review, which wonders at the lack of female representation. In a country with giants like Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, Nan Goldin, and Helen Frankenthaler pushing the bounderies of art; it's impossible to think of this book as anything other than a reflection of Updike's personal preferences. Therefore, don't expect a comprehensive collection of essays about ""the best"" (whatever that means) American art."
2,Why does Updike ignore women artists?,"I find it disturbing that John Updike can apparently find no female artist worthy of mention in his book...beyond one artist who is practically unknown. And she is included only because his family owned a piece of artwork created by her. Updike seems very dismissive of even this one female contributor.He does find room in his book to include a nude photo of the great artist Georgia O'Keefe, but no actual artwork created by O'Keeffe. That should give you a clue what the rest of the book is like.Disturbing, too, are Updike's dismissive comments about Edward Hopper; he claims that Edward Hopper can't paint faces very well.So even though I purchased this book, I don't recommend it to others. Give this one a pass."
1,weak time novel,"I typically enjoy SF books, but this is one is quite weak. Time travel is a tricky subject, many paradoxes are possible, which are largely ignored in book. The German phrases that are scattered through the book (funny that there are very few French phrases, it is after all in Paris, even though occupied by the Nazis) are all grammatically incorrect and seem to be taken straight from Hogan's Heroes."
3,Decent Time Travel Novel,"I felt the characters in this novel were weak and shallow. There were also so many ""ifs"" in this book, I mean I can understand one miracle, but there were a lot of I beamed (which sounded a little ""trekky"" to me) out at the last second for it to seem plausible."
1,"Wait for the DVD version, it will be worth it!",If you purchased the DVD U2Elevation Live from Boston you may have noticed a short clip of this concert in the extras section. The sound quality is so superior that I suggest waiting for the producers to release the DVD version before spending your hard earned on this VHS. Hopefully they'll get their act together soon.
2,very average,after the Joshua Tree U2 has gotten down-right way to Self-Indulgent.this concert was a Vegas show at best.it has a couple of good moments but more often then not it's very average.
1,This CD highlights how good the Cure are,"As a fan of The Cure, I decided to get this CD to hear how other groups would pay tribute to this great band. I am very disappointed. Instead of a tribute, I feel that this was more of a promotional scheme by October records to get their weak roster some air play. All of the songs are played by techno bands belonging to October records. It is easy to tell good techno from bad techno, and these groups are all examples of bad techno. They are musically weak and simple. They have taken the technically beautiful songs of Robert Smith and reduced them to their most simple form. I have even more respect for The Cure after hearing this CD and realizing that not everyone can play at Robert Smith and clan's level."
4,A Gem of a Book from the Gem State,"I had the honor of hearing Marianne Love read chapters of this book as she was writing them and shared in her glee as it was published. She writes such vibrant, wild tales of her youth that one can't help but be absorbed into the book and want to keep reading. This book has all the flavor of ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and more. It's a shame this book never spent time on the bestseller lists for all the world to discover."
3,sweet and funny,"John Cusack(Better Off Dead, Identity, Max) and Catherine Zeta-Jones(Traffic, High Fidelity, The Mask OF Zorro) are America's Sweethearts but they were when Cusack went nuts..so he's at this clinic where Alan Arkin(Jereky Boys Movie, Grosse Pointe Blank) is his doctor..so he is let free when his newest movie is released featuring Jones..so Billy Crystal(Father's Day, Deconstructing Harry, This Is Spinal Tap)..it's directed by a very funny Christopher Walken(Suicide Kings, Nick OF Time, Sleepy Hollow)..also starring Seth Green(Party Monster, Stephen King's IT, Idle Hands), Julia Roberts(Erin Brockovich, Oceans Elven2001, PRetty Woman), Hank Azaria(Godzilla1998, Heat, Great Expectations1998), Eric Balfour(Trojan War, Cant Hardly Wait, Texas Chainsaw Massacre2003) and Stanley Tucci(The Core, Big Trouble, The Pelican Brief)...highlight would have to be when Seth Green and Billy Crystal talk threw the walkie talkies.Hilariousfavorite lineAlan Arkin-(sniffs a leaf) life is a cookie"
1,NO NO NO...,"This is a horrible movie; please do not waste your money unless you have rented it first. My girlfriend and I both wonder how a movie with such an all-star cast, a cast that we both admire, could be so incredibly bad. This movie skipped the editing room. My parents saw this after many others and my warnings; afterwards they noted how grueling this picture was to sit through. If you have not seen this movie, do not waste your time. If you want the DVD make sure, you see it first."
4,Sweet Comedy with great cast!,"Where can you find Billy Crystal, Julia Roberts, John Cusack, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Hank Azaria in the same place? Here, in the movie America's Sweethearts. The initial premise of a married couple (John Cusack and Catherine Zea-Jones)garnering the country's attention by making movies together is a little loose, considering our cynical view on Hollywood, but thankfully, the story doesn't focus on them. Instead, it focuses on a budding relationship between John Cusack's character and Julia Robert's character. Every character gives an exciting performance that keeps the movie moving along without any slack. You won't be disappointed if you're looking for a delightfully funny escape."
1,How embarrassing,"American Sweathearts is a testament to the acting abilities of Cusack, Jones and Roberts in that they manage to hide what must surely be complete embarrassment and discomfort in acting out each scene. This movie is lousy, unfunny, and totally devoid of charm. The acting is so cutsey and the plot so inane it would surely be a smash hit with the pre-teen crowd--not what the movie is marketed at. The only reason it deserves 1 star is the slap in the face of Walken, who's character and acting was actually enjoyable.A total waste of money."
2,john cusack is in this...,"but that doesn't make it good, surprisingly enough.........wish for better!"
1,Not America's Sweethearts,"This is a very shallow movie. Its about hollywood life and how one couple try to act and deceive the public in order for their movie to be a hit at the box office. Frankly I found Catherine Zeta-Jones annoying as the whining, self absorbing and shallow little starlet. Julia Roberts who plays Kiki, is the sister of the whining star. She lets herself be belittled by her sister and I didn't really like that. Stand up for yourself!Eddie played by John Cusack, is so scatterbrained that he belongs in therapy. He's very clueless about himself and his life. I know its just a movie, but I don't like to see anyone being manipulated and I actually like strong characters in a movie. Its amazing that this movie opened huge, considering that its plot stinks. This movie clearly shows and confirms that people in hollywood are shallow, and egoistic maniacs that will do anything to get ahead in their career. There's nothing to be admired about this silly movie or hollywood."
4,Pleasant Plot to Watch -- Good Acting,"This was look at behind the scenes Hollywood about prominent ""public marriage"" gone bad between two prominent starts. Acting was good by all four major stars. Also, the new boyfriend's role is great! Accent is so funny!Some of the scenes are just hilarious, e.g. boyfriend picking fight in restaurant is great!"
2,Not believable,"I love Billy Crystal - so I couldn't wait to see this movie. Boy was I disappointed. While all the actors are fantastic, Julia, Katherine, Billy, Hank, and John, I just didn't believe the story. Katherine's character was so ruthless, I didn't believe that John's character could ever like her, much less love her. And, they didn't develop the relationship between him and Julia's character enough to make that believable either...Witty writing, but the story wasn't enough to make me want to watch it again!Oh well...I'll just stick with When Harry Met Sally, and City Slickers!"
4,Julia Roberts is truly America's sweetheart,"Let's admit it, the movie was no-brainer couch-type-on-a-rainy-day kind of film. Some would even say it's a harmless dating movie. Although it was (maybe) intended to reveal the true painful lives of Hollywood stars despite the glitz & glamour, it did not come out too successfuly in the market. & although it also dealt on a true & undying love (Julia for John), it was taken lightly though it ended pretty well --- the way cheesy Hollywood films should, anyway. In spite of these & its other flaws, the film remained lovable in its own way...why? I personally think it's because of Julia. Though she was more of like a background actor, supporting her brat superstar sister, it's her usual sweet persona that held the movie together & kept its charm. I say, Julia Roberts is trully America's sweetheart :-)"
1,Waste of time,"I can't believe that Billy Crystal after making ""When Harry met Sally"" and ""Analyze This"" can mix up his name with a production like this. Go for a walk instead."
1,horrible,I was surpised how much I disliked this movie because im not picky with movies at all but this movie was just a lame wanna be romance flick it truly was awful.
4,America's Sweethearts,"Many people have given this movie horrible reviews, but I really enjoyed it. The cast is what made this movie wonderful. Catherine Zeta-Jones played the prima dona over the top, and it really worked. Billy Crystal is as always delightful. Christopher Walken always seems to play some kind of dark character, but maybe that is because he is so good at it. I was surprised how much I liked Julia Roberts and John Cusack together. They had great chemistry, and were just so natural together."
4,A plesant night in.,"Billy Crystal proves that he is at least as good a writer as he is an actor with Americc's sweethearts.The casting is well done, although you can almost claim Zeta Jones is typecasting considering what happened with Michael Douglas only without the kids involved.Crystal's character is the perfect cynical foil. You love to both love and hate this guy. Cusack is a lot of fun. Hank Azara as always is a hoot, I think he is the most underrated comic actor in the country. Alan Arkan shines in his small role as does Christopher Walken who is the funniest character in the whole movie, I would love to see the picture he made. It is a great plot twist. (Why does he always play nuts?)Julia Roberts is ok but nothing to write home about. Am I the only one who thought Julia Roberts looks better with the phoney weight?The writing makes this movie, the acting complements it.Watch this movie, you will complement it too."
1,This was soooo Bad!,"After seeing the trailer for this film, I really wanted to see it. Now, after having seen it, I'm sorry I did. It isn't funny at all and both of the main characters, Gwen and Eddie, are boring and annoying. In addition to this, it's pretty unbelievable to see Julia Roberts 60 lbs. overweight, frumpy and mousy. The worst part, however, were the jokes leveled at Gwen's Spanish lover. The only thing he, or anyone else, was interested in was his sexual prowess and size. I find this stereotypical and racist. Generally, I enjoy all of the actors that were in this film, but it turned out to be a huge disappointment and I don't recommend it at all."
2,What happened?,You would think that with this cast the movie would be good. But a bad story and script can't be saved no mattered how good an actor is or how big of a star they are. There are a few funny parts but not many. The movie is mostly very bland and boring.
3,Won't Win Any Oscars,"This movie wasn't amazing, but it was a cute story. It was interesting to think about everything that goes into publicizing a movie, and what the actors are like in real life. Crystal's character was very funny. See it at some point if you don't have anything better to do, but don't spend too much on it."
1,offensive in the name of humor,"The actors and story were OK, but there were enough offensive lines (the one I remember being about ""circle jerks"") that I agree with my wife's evaluation: a dumb movie and a waste of time."
2,Typical Julia Robert's fluff film.,"This film was unfortunately a typical Julia Robert's film. In other words it was average at best.Billy Crystal was wonderful as usual, and Catherine Zeta Jones did a splendid job in her role of the snotty sister. But Cusack and Robert's didn't bring it together.The plot was your typical love story plot, but the poor acting of Roberts and Cusack simply wrecked it. Robert's gave her typical stinted and lacksidaisical acting and didn't draw you into her character at all.Unfortunately the great cast couldn't bring it together with this film.I'd wait until this one hits the cheap theatres or rent it. Don't waste your money at the theatres, you will only be disappointed."
2,Star Studded Folly,"How did someone take a light-hearted but cute premise, big name stars, and turn it into such a lame and inane film? The talent is obviously there, but the movie simply doesn't work. Alternating between over-the-top (which I think was the point) and deadly dull (which probably wasn't), this film stalls and fizzles."
2,This movie is terrible!,I did not like this movie at all. What was the point. Julia Roberts is not a good actress. John Cusack is a psycho drug addict. Billy Crystal says nothing funny. This movie is a waste of time.
2,Not very good.,"A great cast and a lousy script = bad movie. A painfully unfunny, dull and lifeless movie has each actor trying his/her best to liven up a deadly script without success. You may chuckle once or twice, but that's it. About 20 minutes in, I knew this would be a stinker. I was right."
3,Frothy fun in hollywood,This is a nice film that explores the world of the film junket where journalists go along to do five minute in-depth interviews with film stars. They are usally in some remote location and journalists are plied with stuff to make their reviews as favourable as possible.It is a game and journalist and actor agree to play it.Writer and actor Crystal takes us to this world and has a lot of fun as estranged actor couple cusack and Zeta Jones play a bickering pair who get together to sell their film.Crystal takes a cynical look at hollywood and then cannot resist the temptation to have a Hollywood ending. I enjoyed it particularly Zeta Jones as a nasty piece of work.
3,Another Julia Roberts Movie. Need I Say More?,"This movie is funny. Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones may have been the big draws for some people, but you can't beat the trio of Billy Crystal, John Cusack (one of my favorite actors), and Hank Azaria.This movie will make you laugh, but it definitely won't make you think. You also won't have this at the top of any of your lists.If you love Roberts, or Cusack, then watch this movie. Otherwise, there are some much better movies out there."
4,Liked it but...,"I really liked this movie in the theater - just the thing to help you forget your troubles. John Cusack is definitely one of my faves (look for sister Anne and friend Steve Pink in small roles) and, as been noted in other reviews, Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfectly cast. So, from the point of view of the movie itself, this DVD is super.I am just now getting into buying DVDs and one of the things that I like is the behind the scenes extras and that is where this one falls short. Trailers for America's Sweethearts plus two other older movies and a commentary track do not an outstanding DVD make - and that's why, even though the movie makes me laugh out loud, I only gave it 4 stars."
2,S - L - O - W !,"This was, quite possibly, the WORST movie I've ever seen. I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and push the actors to ""hurry up and get to the point!"" And Christopher Walken is in the movie for a scant 5 minutes, if that -- why they even put him on the label is beyond me. Don't waste your money. If you really want to see it, get it from the library."
2,Not The Worst,"Not the worst comedy out today but not the best. With the high powered cast I was hoping for more. Julia Roberts shines, once again, and saves this movie from a one star rating. As the overlooked sweet little sister to the popular self-centered older sister she brings her role to believability. John Cusack turns in his typical solid performance and there was a nice cameo by Christopher Walken.Overall, it had its moments but there are much better films. It has a feel good ending as audiences are always rooting for the good guys."
2,Romantic comedy?,"An odd catagory for a movie that seems intent on doing without romance or comedy.With this cast it's fair to say that expectations might have been set too high, but geez what were they thinking? I mean they all have basically decent track records and none of them notices that the movie is bombing?Annoying characters, less than entrancing chemistry, and a diligent focus on the dreadful nature behind a Hollywood ""star"" who is so annoying that I began hoping that a plot twist would kill her off.Seth Green has some good moments, but if you want to see an all around brillant ""inside Hollywood"" movie I'd recommend ""The Player"" from 1992 - which also happens to feature Julia Roberts and John Cusack."
2,Far Below It's Cast,Shallow. That pretty much sums up this film which is neither heartwarming nor sweet and derives most of it's humor from crude jokes and sophomoric antics.
1,"Yes, it's possible for John Cusack to make a bad movie","I was flipping through the channels some time ago and came across this movie, which I had misfortune of paying for when it was in theaters. To say it was a waste of fine acting talent is certainly true, but doesn't capture awfulness and pointlessness of the film.The film was awful because the writing was awful, and great actors (although slightly miscast) and good directing could not make up for something that just wasn't there.Console yourself in watching classics for the actors in these movies instead: for Cusack, watch ""The Sure Thing""; for Roberts, ""Notting Hill""; for Walken, ""The King of New York""; for Zeta-Jones, ""Traffic"" and for Crystal, ""When Harry Met Sally."" Now *those* are some movies worth watching."
5,"A Witty, Fun Movie","This movie has it all.....It's witty, funny, charming and for the most part has an all star cast. I'm sorry fans, but I do not like Billy Crystal at all and feel like it was a waste having him in the movie. However, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta-Jones, John Cusack, and Hank Azaria have such a wonderful on screen chemistry together, making this movie a must see and a great purchase."
1,A waste of Talent,"This movie proves my statement that Hollywood is running out of ideas. The one star is for the effort, but otherwise there was no plot, no great effects and definitely NO originality.I was surprised with this considering the actors' talent in other films, maybe they didn't work well together, or there was just a lack of enthusiasm, but either way this film was surprisingly boring and very predictable."
3,Hank Azaria should act in more movies,"Here's a Hollywood film that I enjoyed when I saw it, but in retrospect, was only slightly better than the others. John Cusack is awesome, and I've always loved his movies, since the classic 80's comedy Better Off Dead, and more than ever, after one of my all-time favorite comedies, High Fidelity. Julia Roberts cancels out John Cusack. Catherine Zeta Jones is neutral. And Billy Crystal puts the movie in qualitative debt. Luckily, there is Hank Azaria (Tuesdays With Morrie, Mystery Men, The Birdcage, Quiz Show, The Simpsons, and voice of Venom on the 1990's Spider-Man TV show) to put the movie above the mediocre standpoint. His Spanish sleazeball with a lisp is hilarious, and practically makes the movie, along with the lead actor, John Cusack. There's not much depth to this movie, but it's fun for a while, I guess."
1,How Gross!,A sister going after her sister's husband?! That's disgusting. How morally corrupt we are that people don't see that anymore but rather view this as entertainment!
1,It could be the worst movie I've seen besides High Fidelity,"This movie was bad. C.Z. Jones is a spoiled (...) in this movie and Cusak plays the same dopey, nobody loves me characted he plays in all of his movies. Billy Crystal was funny at times (first time since Throw Momma from the Train). My advice to anybody considering buying this movie is don't. Rent it if you must but you'll want your $3.75 rental fee back when it's over."
1,A waste of John Cussack,"This movie was such a disappointment. Although the female actors had an opportunity to capitalize on their relationship with one another (despite the ridiculous plot-which is so forgettable, thank God), Julia Roberts plays like she's taking a break from her busy acting career and Catherine Zeta Jones makes no effort to add MUCH-needed charisma or sympathy to her character. As for John Cussack...well, he just seems to be caught in the middle. The token male.American Sweethearts could have passed for believable, or funny, or not so stupid. There were no redeemable qualities. The director wasn't able to get anything out of his actors and to be honest I don't think the actors even tried, or cared.The one star is for Billy Crystal's line: ""That's a whole Backstreet Boy""."
4,It really does have to grow on you,"The first time i saw this move I hated it. For some reason I decided to watch it again, and by the third time this was one of my favorite moves. It really does have to grow on you. So if you watched it once, or maybe even twice,try it again. Its really funny."
2,"Women love it, Men hate it!","America's sweethearts, Gwen (played by Catherine Zeta Jones) and Eddie (John Cusack) have just split up. Their new movie, ""Time Over Time,"" could either make or break them. The studio's publicist, Lee (Billy Crystal) must reunite them before the premiere. A sweet movie about Hollywood romances. Fits comfortably into the ""Chick Flick"" category, and is a great movie to watch with your girlfriends."
3,"Good cast, anyway...","I found this movie to be cute and entertaining, though not a real account of genius in the film industry. If you like the cast, I suggest you purchase the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones is great as the snobby superstar, and Julia Roberts portrays her down-to-earth and once-overwieght sister and assistant. A love triangle evolves, making for several very funny scenes. Billy Crystal only adds to the hilarity of the film.A good flick if you like the type. It's nothing beyond temporary entertainment, though."
5,Sassy Satire with Heart,"In a world obsessed with celebrities' every move, Billy Crystal delivers a smart, sassy satire with heart. He brings a hilarious portrayal of celebrity breakups to the screen by telling the triangle of Gwen Harrison, Eddie Thomas and Kiki Harrison.Catherine Zeta-Jones shines as Gwen, the overdemanding much- lauded starlet, and John Cusack is brilliant as Eddie Thomas, her estranged husband and former co-star. Julia Roberts taking a role somewhat in the shadows, is perfect as Gwen's sister, Kiki, whose life is devoted to satisfying every want and whim of Gwen. Having seen Julia as Anna Scott ( Notting Hill ), it was refreshing to see her tackle a different type of character, one who lives in the shadows of the famous, but shines in her own right.The film is smart and funny while delivering a sweet storyline about the choices we make over who we love, when guided by others and the DVD is enjoyable with deleted scenes. Add it to your movie collection today!"
5,This book started me on Durrell,"Durrell is wonderful at describing both animals and people and one gets the feeling one's there, with him, sleeping under a car and trying to keep warm by smoking a cigarrette, or in flight to Jujuy, sitting by a fat and talkative lady, or in Buenos Aires, sorting cars at I don't know how many miles an hour. Absolutely terrific!"
5,Gerald Durrel a man who is greatly missed.,"If you like animals, the environment and laughing out loud...this book (as al of Durrel's books are) should not be missed!"
4,Good product,Much improved from the plastic version I had before. This one keeps the dry food dry from the weather. Don't know about pests as yet but i am satisfied so far.
4,would be GREAT if my dog wasnt scared of it!,"nice feeder, but was made cheaper than i expected for what i paid for it. My dog is scared to death of the door so ive had to stick something in there to prop it open, which in my opinion defeats the purpose! I set it out while i left to go on vacation and my dog still did not eat the entire time we were gone! There is no way you would fit 25lbs of our dog food in it either...maybe 15lbs"
4,Good Feeder,Used this feeder a couple of times when going out of town. Works good for me used under eve of house and is far superior to the plastic type that was eaten into by outside critters the first time used. The magnet closure works decently but could be better.
5,Pretty Slick little unit,"This unit works really well. It keeps my two dogs fed, and just as importantly, keeps other dogs and critters out of their food. I'm pretty sure that I will pay off the unit in 1/2 year just from the savings of not having to feed birds, squirrels, and other dogs. It took a bit of time for one of my dogs to figure the door out, she's a little timid. But once they got it, it was no problem. One minor complaint was that the lid was slightly bent on arrival, it looked like a packaging/shipping issue. I was able to straighten it out with pliers."
4,convient feeder,This is actually being used to feed a couple of pigs in a pen and works great so that they don't turn over the feeder that was previously used. It hold enough food so that you don't have to feed them every day.
4,A real time saver...,This gravity fed dog feeder is well made and easy to install. I did notice that when my dog ate from it the swinging door would sometimes get stuck open allowing water and birds to get into the food. I had to make a slight modification to it and now it closes properly. Overall good purchase.
1,Little Giant Dog Feeder,"I bought this feeder for outdoor use, but every time it rains the dog food inside the feeder gets wet and I have to clean it out. I was forced to put it under a shelter. May be ok for indoor use, but in that case, the magnetic door is pointless."
3,Works 50% of the time!,"I have 4 dogs. A Golden Retriever, 2 lab mixes and a terrier mix. Only the Retriever and one of the labs will eat from it. I had to put a screw driver in the door to prop it open in order for them to eat from it though. Otherwise the door scarred them and they wouldn't eat. The other two dogs won't go near it. I was determined and thought that if they got hungry enough they would. Um...no. I kept an eye on all of them and the one lab didn't eat for 2 days before I finally caved in a put food in a bowl. The terrier would only grab a bit at a time, walk away and chew and then return. I've had it for 3 weeks hoping things would improve. Sadly, no. So, I still keep putting food in it because half my dogs use it (with the door propped open). The other half, I still gotta fill up a bowl every day. So for me, it's a very expensive dog bowl. It is a good quality and I think in theory, it's a good design. It's just my dogs just don't want to stick there head in there."
4,Very interesting read,"Although this book is not of high quality literary-wise, it is very interesting. As a reader you get a realistic glimpse of how life in the Lithuanan Jewish gettho's was during WWII. I was shocked to find out that not only Germans, but Lithuanians and Poles too were involved in mass-killings of innocent people. 'The shadow of death' is a very suitbale titel, because that is exactly how the jewish people must have felt: living in the shadow of death."
3,"beautiful movie, lousy transfer for the dvd","i loved this movie in the theater--just really beautifully shot. But the color on the dvd is all washed out, with an overwhelming yellow tone to it that I don't remember. It's possible I'm just not remembering the original correctly, but I don't think that's the case. It might be worth asking the folks at your local video store to pop it in their player for a minute so you can see for yourself before you decide to pick it up."
1,An awkward and boring movie,"As a native speaker of Shanghai dialect, I have to say that the script is horrible with dialogs very boring and unnatural. Everyone seems to be able to cut their 5 minutes conversation into 20 seconds to mean what they mean. I love slow Chinese movies that use subtle dialogs to hint at the unseen plots (like In the Mood of Love),because it is an efficient and artful way to present the story while focusing on the characters, but the dialogs here only amplify the blankness of the characters. This is a big disappointment especially because the stories can be potentially interesting and the cast is good! It may be pretty to look at, but I would rather stare at a painting."
1,Least interesting of all Chinese films I have seen so far,"I have seen about 45 Chinese films and I have to say ""Flowers of Shanghai"" is the least interesting one I have seen so far. I don't mind very slow movies and some of the other Chinese movies I have liked, such as ""Yellow Earth"" are also slow paced.""Flowers of Shanghai"" takes place in a brothel visited by very well to do Qing officials during the 1880's in Shanghai, a city notorious for its brothels between the late 19th century to the 1930's. While this historical context provides for a potentially interesting storyline, I did not find the scenes of drinking, games and conversations among the Qing officials and their expensive ladies interesting.I am sorry to say I do not recommend ""Flowers of Shanghai"" unless you are a fan of Hsiao-hsien Hou, the director."
1,Restrained? Muted? Boring!,"This movie was tedious. Absolutely nothing happens. Blocking, which is supposed to reflect the tension between the actors, is nonexistent. In fact, the characters hardly move. The cinematographer's only trick is a slow pan; there are no cutaway shots or close ups. It's almost as if the director sought to evoke in the viewer the opium-induced stupor many of his characters reside in. I am no stranger to Chinese cinema; I own a few dozen titles. Nor am I unsympathetic to movies with serious themes; in fact, that is precisely what I find entrancing about Chinese cinema. But this movie will, quite simply, bore you to tears."
1,boring,"this was so boring, the lighting by candlelight added nothing to the movie. I found it all somewhat confusing, I love Chinese films but this one really fails. It was hard to follow just what was happening at any time in the film."
2,BORING...,"I love asian films but this is one of the most boring movie made. Throughout the whole movie, i couldnt even see anyones face and I felt like falling asleep."
1,This product was falsely advertised.,"Although the Vienna Boys Chior was predominantly mentioned on the label (see above), the CD did not actually contain more than one or two performances by the same. I was not satisfied with the product.Peter P. HaaseBoca Raton, Florida"
2,great if you like to rebuild your faucet every few years,"We like this faucet and it looks really great. I'm on at least the third cartridge replacement since buying it in 2006. Moen was good about sending the cartridges under the warranty, but who wants to deal with fixing their faucet every few years? Our water isn't the type of water that is hard on this kind of stuff either."
2,Where did the quality go?,"I have to admit, I didn't buy this product from Amazon. I received it as a free replacement from Moen because of the lifetime guarantee on another faulty faucet. Wow, that's all I can say. Where did the quality go? It's ALL Plastic! And they say it's chrome, what is chrome? It's chrome colored plastic, not metal. I'm extremely disappointed with the quality, however, I must say it works flawlessly. It swivels smoothly and the pull-out hand works well. Although, the handle sits in the base kind of loose. Just make sure you keep your expectations low before purchasing this product."
2,Cheap product,I purchased this faucet to go with a new stainless steel sink. I was looking for something with a pull out spout and a sleek design. I came across this moen product and liked the way it looked. It was really what i was looking for. What a mistake! The quality of it is not the greatest. The pull out part is made of plastic! Because of that it not only looks cheap but also feels cheap! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Looks really nice on the photograph but in reality is nothing like it. Not worth the money.
2,Nice looking but cheap feeling,"Product looks good, but the pull out handle is cheap feeling plastic. The handle does not attach well to the faucet. If you want a better single handle faucet from Moen, try the 87315C model. The handle attaches to the faucet much better and it is about $10.00 cheaper."
1,Do not buy a Moen,"I bought a Moen (kitchen faucet) on the advice of our plumber (he said Moen or Delta) and other plumbers online at the time. I thought we were getting a good brand-name product. Wrong. If the cheap plastic was the only issue, I could live with that. No. We have had it six months and it has a slow drip. It is slow enough that we didn't notice it at first and when we did, thought one of us has not turned it off properly. But we are two adults and always careful about stuff like that. Finally I thought to put a bowl under it and, yes, it has a slow leak. There are times when if you align it just right it might not drip. But 95% of the time it does even when we are careful. Then I go online and find others have had the same problem. The irony is I paid more thinking I was getting a faucet that was better than the cheaper brands. I would not recommend any model of Moen to anyone."
1,What a poorly written text,"We used this text in my last college course, this text was so poorly written. The exams were inaccurate and the exercise questions were bad. It dismayed alot the students in the class."
4,Technology in Action Review,"Fabulous price, arrived very quickly and book was in good condition, although I'm not sure if I missed reading it but it was missing it's CD which came with it. But the price did make up for it."
2,Didn't even crack it open.,Don't you hate it when teachers have you buy these expensive books and then don't use them at all in class?? That happened to me with this book. Just following his notes got me a B in the class. Guess I didn't need it anyway.
1,tech in action,"the seller was great he did all he could to help me out, but i didnt get the whole product from the shipper, I am still missing 3 books"
5,A Top Laymon Novel!,A great book. I have to say I rank it pretty high among all the Laymon books I've read. I am dissappointed to know it's a part of a trilogy and now I must find the other two books to read! This is more gore than most of his books but it didn't stop me from loving it. This is Laymon and the ending is a jaw dropping thrill!
3,King of Trash (the early years),"In 'The Cellar', we see all the hallmarks of Richard Layman's unique mix of sadism, sexual deviance, horny girls, priapic males, hairy beasts, messy sex and messier deaths. For all the silliness of the story, Layman revealed, even in his earliest work, an innate genius for writing un-put-down-ably compelling narratives. Reading Layman is like reading those vaguely scandalous and disreputable pulp fiction rags of the 1920s and '30s. He may have written trash, but he was the most satisfying writer of unapologetic trash in the genre."
1,"disturbing..., and not in a good way","I couldn't find a way to like this book. I usually love an anything with a combo of creepy houses and mysterious characters, sex and violence don't offend me, but I found nothing in this book that worked. I didn't like the mother, the daughter, or even the ""hero"" of this book. Seriously, NO real mother would leave her daughter's side for one moment when faced with the situation that these people were in much have a sexual relationship with a stranger. Trust me, I rarely get shocked or offended, but this story pissed me off. And the lame and stupid name fo the ""monster""....""Xanadu""....stupid,stupid,stupid. What really got me was the detail Laymon went to in the graphic detail about the rape and early compliance that the young girl had with her captor. Personally I think Laymon wrote a few of his own fantasies and tried to pass it off as creative writing. I did something with this book is something I have never ever done in my life. I THREW IT AWAY."
1,Don't bother,"I wouldn't recommend this book at all. The characters were undeveloped and unbelievable to the point of ridiculousness. A mother who would trust strange men instantly not only with her own safety but with that of her daughter's, with everything that happened to them? That was the only horror of this book. The ""hero"" was 1 dimensional and forgettable. The ""monsters"" were laughable. Save the ""$5 and change"", and your time and pass it by."
4,A yarn of questionable judgement,"Richard Laymon's purpose, so it appears, is to give the reader a suspenseful horrific ride, upon a vehicle of poor judgment. His characters just do not use good common sense. Hence, they find themselves in situations which they deserve. I kept saying to myself throughout this book, why the devil would he / she use such poor judgment ? You don't pick up hitchhikers at 2 AM. You don't forsake going to the hospital after a car accident. And you certainly do not go into a place called ""Beast House"" when you are running for your life. Yet this is the type of judgment used throughout, so I found myself having very little sympathy for the victims. However, when you take a look at the purpose of his book from a different perspective, it's all about the carnal vicarious ride. The characters are supposed to put themselves in harms way. The killer is supposed to have opportunities abounding. It is a slasher B movie in print. Decent yarn for this genre."
3,Fairly entertaining,"A fairly entertaining and quick read. A bit disturbing, as a horror novel should be, likeable heroes, ulgy monsters, good writing and lots of action."
1,Please read something else,I'm sorry I really didn't like the book at all. The plot was weak and child rape was it for me. The plot was too far out there and to sum it up find something else to read.Joe
3,Quick read with a great ending,"One of Laymon's better works, although lacking in character development. One thing that really upsets me in fiction is the develpment of a loving relationship within the period of say, 24 hours (and ends in a sexual encounter). That happens in this book and is unrealistic, to say the least.Apart from that, the book is satisfyingly grisly, and the ending will probably take you by surprise as it did me. It would have much more impact if you cared a little more about the characters though."
2,perverted storylines peppered with graphic violence,"I first heard about this book on a ""best horror books of all time"" online list. After reading a rough outline and some minor details involving the plot, i ordered it online. Well after reading it, i have to admit i'm torn. On one hand it is filled with suspense, and is definitely not lacking in the ""shocking"" department. On the other hand pedaphillic rape, and sadomasochistic beastiality seem more disgusting than disturbing to me. After reading a chapter or two i found myself needing a shower, using a brand new bar of soap each time.Apparently there is a whole series of these books. I'm not quite sure why one would actually want to engage in reading a ""series"" of this filth, but its there for you if you so desire.just make sure to stock up on soap"
4,A good read,I have read all of Richard Laymons books that I could get my hands on andThe Cellar was the first and got me hooked. If your looking for a book that you can read and not have to keep up with hundreds of different stories within a story then this one is for you. I really enjoyed just being able to sit down and read a book tht took no effort to understand and just flat out entertained me by its simple people and page turning plot. Laymons books are not for the sqemish or the faint at heart to say the least. If you love horror and gore with a good story behind it then he is your man. Make sure you read Beast House as it explains why things are the way they are. You wont be sorry you did.
4,"A great read, but not scary.....","This was a very interesting book. However, when I bought it, I thought it was going to be scary by the other user's reviews. It was about a beast in a house, and among other things, about a man who rapes little girls. I found that the man was the scariest part of this book because you know that happens all the time. People are sick. But as far as the rest of the story goes about the beast....I did not find it scary at all. But it was still a very good read, and I'm glad I did."
4,Good Start to a Decent Series,"The Beast House series is not anything ravingly original but Laymon is a damn good writer no matter what his plot is. With titles like ""Flesh"" and ""Stake"" many people have written him off as merely a hack pulp horror writer and not even a good hack at that. However, Laymon's style is crisp and sharp cutting through to the readers sensibilities like the razor sharp talons of the creatures he writes of. The Cellar drags out the tension in two ways. One, what is really in the Beast House and two, when will Donna's evil exhusband bite it and how. This first book sets the stage for the other two books (I believe there is a fourth due to come out) which lack any element of surprise similar to the first novel but are credited with Laymon's characteristically terse and dialogue loaded prose."
1,This might be the worst book I have ever read.,"I bought this book based on its good reviews off amazon.com. I have no idea how/why people like this book. The characters are one-dimensional, the story shallow and superficial, and the scenes of rape and torture are unnecessarily graphic and obscene. And the ending... single worst ending I have ever read. So absolutely unbelieveable that it made me want to throw the book away (which I did a day after I finished - couldn't even bear to have it in my house).But I should mention that as I love horror books and movies - I do not like the new genre of horror/torture porn that has come late in recent years - but if you like this sort of thing - then you might like this book?"
2,"It'll give you nightmares, and not in a good way","While looking for new authors I stumbled on to this book. It sounded interesting and there was a lot of good reviews. But how often are those wrong?Let's say I was disappointed in this book. There was a lot that could have gone right in it: Interesting characters, interesting story, things start picking up at a decent pace, a fairly competent author... then you get into the meat of the book. In the end it turned into basically a mix of porn and monsters, and quite a few occasions both. I'm not a prude by any means, but it has it's time in place. And not twenty times in a 300 page book, or with children (alluded to), or with a monster (often).Maybe it's just me and this book just isn't my thing, but I don't think I'm going to be picking up another one of his books anytime soon."
3,B-Movie in book form,"Richard Laymon's, ""The Cellar,"" is straight up your quintessential B-Movie reconfigured into book form. All the elements are intact - gory and savage violence, a high body count, graphic and disturbing sexual content and some nasty, twisted 'bad-guys' to keep things interesting.Originally published in 1980, this 2006 reprint edition will certainly fool many into thinking that this was a recent work as there is nothing by way of story/setting to date this book back a quarter century ago. With a brisk pace and constant flow of violence and action, those looking for a bit of mindless literary entertainment will find the experience satisfying like a good B-Movie should."
3,Dated but Valuable,"The first edition of this book was written back when computers and automated processing was emerging and 'a new thing' so much of the information this book started with is pretty dated. The second edition was updated in the '90s and correspondingly updates some things but, suffice it to say, is still dated now. I would argue though that the information contained therein is still very, very valuable for reference, particularly for purposes of following the 'money and paper trail'. The concepts and theories still apply and the methods by which things are done today are effectively the same (just done electronically not with paper). It also provides good overviews of the processing and bookeeping of various product types."
5,Seminal Work on the Securities Backoffice,"If you need to understand the nuts and bults process of what happens after a trade is made, this is the book for you. A must for those in the industry, in particular, IT developers designing securities software. When I was in the industry, it was my bible."
4,"Learn about securities processing, if you stay awake.","If you manage to stay awake then you too can learn about securities processing from start to finish. This is a great book about how the sell-side brokerage firm works, although much of the information here is outdated; electronic systems have streamlined the process and made it more efficient. Still, this book has a great wealth of information in it. This book impressed me in its clarity and at the same time, its magical ability to be so boring."
3,Not comprehensive enough and unfortunately outdated on marketplaces,"The topics suggested by the title (settlement, etc) are well addressed, but the first half of the book is dedicated to marketplaces and here the book comes up short. Many recent market developments, even those that were in place at the time of writing, appear to be inadequately or inaccurately addressed. Examples:ATSes/ECNs are much more center stage than the book would suggest and are not sufficiently discussedHybrid market mechanics are not discussed muchDark pool liquidity is not addressedOptions market making is not addressed beyond a single paragraph that sheds no light into how Citadel et al make continuous markets electronicallyAnd unfortunately, given that the major development of Reg NMS took place after the book, this makes the marketplace info even less useful."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"The title of this review gives my major criticism of this book. I expected a book of mistakes by the law and by lawyers - wrongful convictions and how they were overturned, and blown prosecutions. On the balance side of the ledger, what I got in place of what I expected was reasonably entertaining to read - stories of eloquent arguement and mistakes both silly and extraordinary by criminals. But I would have been far happier if I had known what I was getting in the first place."
1,A long way from paradise...,"Allegedly based on real events, this cheaply-made effort tells the story of a group of incredibly stupid young people who spend an inordinately lengthy part of the movie doing nothing on a secluded beach, forget the way back, and get lost in a forest. There they are set upon by a group of very weird and menacing backwoods-dwellers. Poor acting, editing and scripting suck all the life out of what is supposed to be a slasher/thriller. The only suspense arises from wondering which member of the group is going to survive. But halfway through, you find yourself not even caring. It's impossible to believe that a real group of teenagers could be such morons."
4,Hat for History,I bought this for my son to wear to his school Virginia history day. The only thing it didn't like about it was it wasn't pointed enough at the tips. Too rounded.
4,A little small for a 6-year-old.,"The quality of the hat was fine, about what I expected. It fit my 4-year-old just fine, but was a little small for my 6-year-old."
4,JUST WHAT WE NEEDED,This item arrived in time and as described -- just what we needed for a school presentation.
2,Dimensional Glass Painting by Priscilla Hauser,"I never received the item from the vendor, Textbooks USA. I am sure the book is of high quality just like all the other Priscilla Hauser books."
1,Big Disappointment,"From the title of this book I fully expected to find trivia specifically about Christmas in Iowa. Instead the articles, receipes, etc. are very generic, i.e. ""Our Old Fashioned Iowa Taffy"", ""Iowa Santa Puppet"". I have not looked at the other books in the series - Michigan Classic Christmas Trivia, Alabama Classic Christmas Trivia, etc., but I suspect that they have the same articles, receipes, etc. with their state name inserted in place of Iowa. A huge disappointment and waste of my money."
2,misleading item,"Well first i want to say that the product looks good but i had a ton of problems with installation. The package comes with only 2 dinky screws. so i had to purchase anchors, etc. Then came time to install it on the wall and it came flying down. The holes in the wood that the company thinks will hold the shelf on the wall, do not! We needed bracket supports, and on and on. It was a nightmare and the morale is: this floating shelf is less floating and more bolted to my wall!!!"
2,"Decent quality, hanging system is flawed","Good: These are hearty ledges and they look nice. I like the groove on the surface which prevents pictures from sliding forward. The texture of the ledge is nice too. It's not completely smooth like a lot of the laminate ledges you see for sale. Those look like fake wood in my opinion.Bad: Anchoring system is a bit flawed. You basically have to insert two screws at a near perfect amount of penetration thru trial and error (about 80%). Then you slide the ledge over the screw head. If the screws aren't just right, the ledges will not be extremely flush. I noticed a bit of an outward tilt with my ledges, but I have an older home with imperfect and slightly uneven plaster walls. I don't recommend these ledges at all for this type of wall. If you have newer construction or drywall, they should work much better though.Quality is good, but they are overpriced for what you get. About 2-1/2 stars on this one."
5,Amazing,"Jet Black New Year is one of the best songs I've ever heard in my life. Stunning lyrics such as ""burn these words from our lips as the dagger screams 'love is dead'"" haunt this amazing cd. It's a little different than the other Thursday cd's, but it's thrilling nonetheless. If you like Thursday, you'll love this album. If you don't love the album, you'll still love Jet Black New Year. Even if you don't like this genre of music, you have to appreciate the lyrics these geniuses write."
2,disappointing,"Thursday helped define the genre, but beginning with a City by the Light Divided the band sounds flat and no longer relevant. The four live tracks here are among the best songs that band has written, but the vocals are muddled and contain none of the urgency and dynamism of the studio recordings. The new studio track is simply disappointing. It lacks the melody and tonal structure of the band's best work."
4,Emo-Core?,"so i downloaded a cupple of the songs from this album the other day when i was trying to stay awake for my girlfriend to call. i was surprised to find that they sound a lot like finch, thursday, and taking back sunday. dont wait to long go get this c.d."
4,SMACKED in the face By Memory Lane,"If your a newer fan than this is good, for some questions you may have or things you may be wondering.This is a good set and I recommend this to fans of anything Smackdown.I'm not going to bother with the match list; seeing how a bunch of users already gave they're thoughts, Impressions on them."
2,Waste of Time!!!,When you see the Best of Smackdown you think of Complete Material right ?? Not here its a Countdown show of the Best Moments of Smackdown!! .. Dont Waste your time here folks what I seen of the Used set I bought thats Scratched and unplayable in certain segments was unbearable to watch .. Bad production WWE ... This just doesnt do the Brand of Smackdown justice..
1,DO NOT BUY!!RIP OFF,"Do not buy this if you are expecting a repeat of the raw 15th anniversary dvd its just clips they are not in their entirety its mostly douchebags like miz,regal,micheal hayes and josh grisham giving comments i do not recomend it at all"
3,OK dvd,"I am a huge fan of the wwf/e. I was so excited about the release of this set. I was hoping it would be just like the prev. RAW set they released, boy was my hopes crushed. This set features SOME complete matches that are pretty good. All of the moments are just clips, they are presented in a top 100 countdown style. I also noticed that everytime they would show blood it would go Black and White, WTF! I really think this set could of been ALOT better."
1,Terrible,"Sounds like a great game for a young person, right?Think again!The game had even my 13-year old, an accomplished gamer, baffled. His younger brother experienced only frustration and tears.Thankfully we rented this before we bought it.This untested, rushed-out, nothing-new, and innappropriate game is the fruit of a handful of companies who monopolize the whole PS2 indistry.I say this game does best to rot in the warehouse."
1,Antiquated,I purchased this book at the suggestion of a Conservatively trained rabbi to assist a friend with conversion studies. I find the text and particularly the photos to be so antiquated and dated that they do a disservice.
5,Impressive!,"This is a lens I had been considering for use on my K-5 as a moderate wide walkaround for some time. Every time I just about pulled the trigger on it, I would read some so-so review and look at the price and think, no way. Well, even after seeing the first few images taken with this lens, all I can say is WOW! The color and contrast this lens produces is just incredible. It's readily apparent even wide open, where the performance of this lens is beyond anything I expected (the color and contrast is as good as any Zeiss or Leica glass I have shot over the years). From a few reviews, I was also a little worried about sharpness. I don't know if I just lucked out but my copy is very sharp. Anyway, if you have been going back and forth on this lens, all I can say is just buy it! It's really that good."
4,Good book,"This is a good book for any cockatiel owner and has the right balance of experience, advice, scientific knowledge, and personal anecdotes. However, some of the photos and paintings are of poor quality, giving the book an unprofessional appearance."
5,plain talk about the care and personality of cockatiels.,"when I first saw the book at the book store the cover sold me,even if I didn't like the book,I love the painting it was just like my Joshua,Moe-Joe and my yellow cockatiel Gabriel posed for the painting.I love the book too,I learn my cockatiels could eat cottage cheeze.Gabe likes cottage cheeze,the other don't.Thank you for writing it."
2,"Changed the formula, will not buy again!","I'll keep this short and sweet, As of some point in June 2011 they changed the label and formula of the powder. It now tastes caulky and will not mix well. I get large chucks of powder in my bottle. This used to be my favorite power now I'm going to have to find a new one. :("
4,It's awesome if you maintain a strict diet and workout routine.,"I've gained almost five pounds after my first tub. There's some water build up in your muscles from the creatine but it wears down after not working out for a couple days. Also, watch your diet or this stuff is gonna make you fat."
1,Beware Of Product Labeling,"Before you buy this product, scroll down and click ""Click here for nutritional information from the product packaging."" You will notice that the label states that there are 0 (Zero) calories from fat per serving yet it states below that one serving has 8 grams Total Fat (23% of daily value) and 15 grams of SATURATED fat (45% of daily value). You don't have to be a math genius to know that something is wrong here and, if they can't even get the label right, why would you trust the ingredients in the product? Take at your own risk.CytoSport Cyto Gainer Protein Drink Mix, Chocolate Malt, 6 Pound"
4,Good stuff,Good working stuff. Only good for post workout to get some healthy carbs and calories in. If you take it 3 times a day like they suggest you will just get a stomach because the carbs hide out there. So I would suggest this product for post-workout and then just up your calorie/fat/carb intake with an increased balanced diet.
3,The Michalka Sister's,"The Michalka Sister's are great. They write there on music and both have great vocies. Pluse there also actress, Aly star's as Keely Teslow in the Disney Channel series Phil of the Future. AJ stared on episodes of CBS The Guardian. Now the to sister's star as Taylor(Aly)& Courtney(AJ)Camden in the new Disney Channel moive ""Cow Belles""(Premiering on Disney Channel Friday March 24, 2006) about two wealthy teen sisters that are forced to work in the family dairy business by their exasperated father. So you see Aly & AJ are really great, they write & sing ther heart's out & they act to. Pluse you can buy there CD ""In To The Rush"" now and I know if there DVD as good as there CD. Then its a must have."
2,"Used Quality item, did not last a full year","I purchased this item in late 2007, and literally the first time I began using it, the green light indicating that power was flowing would go on and off, which is the problem that occurred with the previous one that I had purchased with the actual laptop, right before it died. I didn't think anything of it, but have spent almost every time using it moving it around so that the electricity light would come on. It completely died less than a year after buying it, I made the mistake of not returning it when I first noticed issues. I bought this new, but its quality was cheap, shoddy, and I would not recommend this seller."
3,I Like It!!,"Call me strange, but I actually liked this movie.It is what the movie, ""Signs"" should have been.I liked the aliens in it because they were aggressive, nasty, and clever. The tone of the film was sullen, depressing and dark.I like Stephen Baldwin even if he has ""no facial expressions"". Maybe it is because he was abducted by aliens in real life, and Billy Zane remind's me of one of my cousin's. hahaI am going to buy this movie, with pride."
3,SIGNS OF THE TIMES,"I have to admit that I enjoyed this much more than the bigger-budgeted SIGNS. At least SILENT WARNINGS remains coherent, and its cast of relative unknowns do pretty good. Name stars Stephen Baldwin and Billy Zane have little screen time; Baldwin as usual makes the best of it, and Zane as usual stinks. I don't know how he's had a career.Anyway, the special effects are fine for a low budget movie; the director, Christian McIntire, manages to create an eerie and suspenseful mood, with some genuinely scary moments.Overall, a fairly entertaining and diverting spooker."
2,Low budget alien invasion movie.,I should have known if it had Stephen Baldwin in it with top billing it was going to be a stinker. The only part I liked was the last 10 to 15 minutes. Because it had a decent ending I'll give it two stars instead of one.
1,Wow this movie is bad,"Don't see this crappy SCIFI pictures ripoff of Signs. It's really bad.PS: This movie claims that it stars one of the Baldwin brothers (I forget which one). He's in it for 3 to 5 minutes in the begining and gets fried. Man, is this movie desperate for viewers."
4,"Nice book, but not what I thought it would be","As a local builder/remodelor, I was looking for a book that would contain some great ideas for additions as well as some new helpful strategies or solutions to common problems that occur doing additions. This book fell short of my expectations. It focuses on a few addition projects and highlights the details of those additions. If the house(s) that you are working on is/are not one of the styles highlighted, there may not be much here for you. That said, there are some great ideas in these projects that are worth the price of the book, but be forwarned that you will not learn much, and that there are not pages and pages of different ideas."
2,Poor quality,IThe first one I received was smashed so I returned it and reordered. I got a second one that did not work. I returned it. Theses were poor quality closcks that looked cheap and were obviously not well made.
3,looking for Sonny Landham movie!,"Amazon has misst again! I came across this Great kids movie, while looking thou all of Mr. Sonny Landhamd's movies! Realy can't see Mr. Landham singing on a kids sing-a-long movie!"
4,A Little Girls favorite toy,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter. She enjoys playing with it everyday and she has some how figured out to get her other barbies on the stand to take pictures also.She really does enjoy this toy-- Keep up the good work Mattel
1,A Fashion Don't,"My 4 1/2 yr. old just had to have this doll, so I relented and bought it. Don't you make the same mistake! Putting it together was a nightmare that even an 11 yr. old struggled with. Moreover, once it was done, it tilted to one side.(In other words, Barbie looked like she was falling down sideways. We could not keep her upright and straight.)When we clicked the camera, she made a spastic move, not at all like the graceful catwalk moves we imagined like in the commercials! She is programmed to only make a couple of moves, so there is really no photo shoot to speak of, just a couple of jerks and twitches. The Barbie was left on the kitchen table after 15 minutes of play. My daughter was really disappointed.The dog, however, got a new toy to chew up."
3,just a regular barbie,"I bought this for my niece for her birthday since her mom is a photographer. Well, according to her, it was difficult to work and they couldn't get the barbie in the shoes that held her in place on the platform. My niece just uses her as one of her normal barbies. That stinks considering I could've spent a lot less for a cheap barbie! I wouldn't bother getting this again unless the girl is older than 8 years old and you plan to figure it out and show her right away."
4,Not your average Starvenger...,"Getter Robo-Armageddon left my head spinning for several different reasons. I initially purchased this dvd because I had always loved the Starvengers segment of Force Five and was immediately drawn by the nostaligia factor. However, what I found was that there were only trace similarites between the old Force Five Five series and ADV's current release. The new Getter Robo series is extremely dark and disturbing and the story-line, at this point, is somewhat schizophrenic and difficult to follow. The action sequences are extremely intense, and if you are a mecha fan, it is really interesting to see the different generations of Getter mecha. The animation is not as sophisticated as Evangelion or Macross Plus, but it seems to work well. If you are looking for a simple anime with all questions answered, then Getter Robo is not for you. However, if you are willing to relinquish control and let the story unfold, then sit back, buckle-up, and enjoy the ride."
4,NIce but not as good as the old flannel cloths.,"I think it's good but for wiping down after playing or for buffing after wax on my classical guitar bodies, I think I prefer the old flannel cloths instead. Micro-fiber seems to be slicker and generally did not feel that it was doing the job (mostly removing finger prints etc). Maybe it needs to wear out a bit or if it had a thicker nap to it."
1,This product is NOT NUT-FREE!,"If you have nut allergies, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It is advertised as ""nut-free"", a term that means it has NO NUTS. If you buy it, as I did & read the insert INSIDE THE BOX, it says ""Allergen information: This product manufactured on equipment used for processing peanuts & tree nuts"". I ordered this product because I have had allergic reactions to candies manufactured on equipment used for processing peanuts & tree nuts. ""Nut-free"" means free of nuts. A plain candy bar does not say it is nut-free, it simply says ""milk chocolate"", or whatever it IS, not what it is NOT. ""Nut-free"" is a very specific term, and does not jibe w/the allergen info inside the box. If someone eats this, not having read the insert they can become dangerously, ill.The candy itself is delicious; I loved it before I developed nut allergies, I just want to warn anyone w/the allergy who may believe it is safe to eat."
4,"A good value, alternative to teak","We purchased 4 chairs, 3 ottomans,and a corner piece. Was fairly easy to put together.Based on customer reviews,we decided to lightly sand all items and applied 3 coats of teak oil (sanding between coats) prior to use. This improved the texture and smoothness of the wood. In addition, we attached 1.5"" sides on the bottom of the legs to keep wood dry and prevent chipping when moving furniture around.We also treated cushions with upholstery protector and a mildew retardant. I haven't even put the cushions on the furniture yet, I can't see them looking good after sitting on them. The cushions are a ridiculously light color, and we intend to choose a more suitable fabric and make our own removable covers. Not sure if I would even try to remove the current covers and launder, even though they are zippered and removable."
5,love the stathwood balboa set,"We got the chaise lounge and the ottoman, both were simple to put together (it helps to have two people for the chaise as it is heavy) and look more expensive than they cost. the cushions are firm as others have stated, but not too much and i prefer firm rather than soft. overall this set looks nice, is heavy and sturdy, and a great purchase."
2,"""some "" assembly required!","Difficult to put together! The holes for the screws were full of some foreign material..had to ""oil"" them to get even one screw into the 2 screw openings for the legs.Delivery process was complicated and less than easy."
2,Try before you buy,"If you can, find this product at a store before buying. Find a demo unit and try it using what you think would be your natural seating position (for me, I use it at my desk at home). That's because it is easily four inches too narrow. To use it properly you need to squeeze your legs together, which is very unnatural. Even then, I find that my feet can't naturally rest flat on the massage pads (I have to consciously force them to rest flat). Also, the angle of the unit is slightly too flat; five or so degrees of incline would be useful.This unit replaces a Conair foot massager that served me well but died recently. It is lighter than the Conair and MUCH smaller (see above). The Conair offered features not found on the Homedics: variable-speed massaging and independent heat; the Homedics combines heat with massage, it can't be turned on by itself.The Homedics does look cool with its blue and red lighting, but the size (actually, the lack thereof) marks it down"
4,Your feet will thank you,"It's vibrating feature is a little weak, a person can stall it if he/she puts excessive pressure on it. The ""Infraded Heat"" feature does not emit enough heat in my opinion. A person needs to understand that it is not a commerical unit and you get what you pay for. I walk many, many, miles a day and it sure feels good at the end of the day having my feet massaged. Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit."
4,My mom loves it!,"Got this for my mom and she loves it. She is on her feet a lot caring for my dad -- and she loves this. She said it works great. Sorry no specifics, but she loves it."
5,Soothing,Makes your feet feel wonderful. This is so relaxing to sit down and have your feet massaged without leaving your home.
2,Hello Kitty Flashlight,"I purchased this flashlight for my daughters birthday a few months back. It does come equipped with a AA battery- however the battery went dead within 2 days.After replacing the battery with a high quality brand, it stopped working. We'd have to keep clicking it on and off about 20 times to get it to work. The quality of it is not too great and doesn't stand up to a young childs rough play."
3,kitty lite,"My daught loves this lite, however I am now on my 3rd one. She doesn't know I have to keep replacing it. It just stops working after about 1 month. Glad it's cheap enough, should be even cheaper!"
3,Events Finder,"Want to know when the ""big things"" are going to happen in your life? This book helps you to easily identify the ""forks in the road"" as they occur in your life. If you want to know when you'll get married or if you'll someday find fame and fortune, read this book!"
2,Worst book I have purchased in a long time,This book is very poorly written and extremely difficult to pick up the thread of the system. Fortunately I had other astrological books in my library to understand the system.The publication diagrams in many cases have hand written notations on them that are quite difficult to decipher if at all.And that is only the first few chapters whilst later chapters contain ad nauseam conversations in the first person with others.In short if you want to know about Solar Arcs and Second Progressions there are far better books on the market.
3,interesting info,"I think the book provides some interesting information. I don't know about all of it, still reading it, over halfway through. Some of it jives with my experience, and some of it, for me, I wouldn't necessarily come to the same conclusions. However, he's been doing this for a long long time. Looking back at some of my solar arc over planets and angles in the past, some were uneventful, and some were very eventful. He seems to be more sure about some of the types of events that will happen whereas I believe that the soul's evolutionary level can make predictions very hard, especially the scale of the event. Sometimes, we expect something really big when it's something much less grand."
3,US Navy Destroyer,"I didn't purchase this model of a Fletcher Class destroyer as a toy. I served on three different destroyers in the 50-60's. I purchased it as a reminder for me of good, bad, and difficult times at sea.Ken Irons"
3,Bill and Gloria Gaither,"This dvd is a good Christmas spirit lifter...the comedy was ok....the singers were good...however,several groups and artists did several numbers while others did none (or they were not included on this dvd) I wanted to hear some of the other artists...I expected more,but got less."
4,Pretty great for a holiday treat,"Nice and enjoyable and relaxing. I could always see more of David Phelps, but the groupseems to enjoy their singing so much that it makes one feel happy along with them"
4,Essence,"Essence is a fascinating story about the ghost of a little girl that haunts a house for centuries. The story takes the reader through many time periods, and provides beautiful examples of human emotion and desire through the introduction of many well developed characters. I could not put this book down, it was extremely entertaining."
4,Not your typical boo...,"I am always open-minded when it comes to ghosts and this story had a definite different spin. I actually looked at the web site prior to reading the book, so I was delighted that the story could be true. The history and lives of the people made it interesting and a good read. I think some of the stories of the families could be novels themselves. I would have enjoyed the book better if it had allowed me to bond with some of the other characters. Worth reading. I appreciate the author's patience and hope of publication, however his editor left a lot to be desired (misspelled words, missing words, etc. causing distraction from the flow of words)."
5,Dolly Lambert in State College PA,"I loved this book and I am an avid reader of ghosts, hauntings, and the macabre. It is most unusual and delightful and I recommend it highly. I was apprehensive at purchasing it because it is classified as a novel, however, there is a website [...] that shows it could be true."
1,Avoid,"Slippery, maybe ice is slipperier. Way to thin and wearing thin at spots within 6 weeks. All reviews listing cons were correct. Wish I had paid more attention to the experience of others. Utopian mat is way to go. Will get one soon."
1,hugger mugger original tapas 80 inch,the only things i liked about the mat was the length and color. the mat has a slippery coating which makes you slide while doing your practice.
1,a very dissapointing movie,"When somebody (including me) saw the potrait immediately thinks great story like Legend of the seeker or any other great fantasy but I am truly and really sorry this is not even close of the category of Seeker or any other , the plot and the movie went slow and did not pick up anything to keep you entertained.So do not buy it or even check it out."
2,Daivd James Elliott Sci-Fi,Being a David James Elliott fan from his role in JAG I purchased his movie Bloodsteel. I must confess to expecting more out of his performance than what I observed. I think the script was lacking in substance which was disappointing. The story line is weak and the characters almost seem mechanical in their quest. Being a total fan of the Lord of The Rings triology I was hoping that this movie would be of similar quality however it is not. Christopher Lloyd does his best to portray his character with believablity however the supporting cast just can't help him out. I thought if I watched it twice it would grow on me but I came away with the same opinion as the first time. I'd love to be more fair about this movie especially because I'm a fan of David James Elliott but I admit to laughing at several scenes that probably weren't meant to be funny. I'm glad I purchased this one used. Not really worth the investment and I'll probably never watch it again.
1,Is it over yet?,"Someone had a bit of courage producing this movie and keeping it at almost 3 hours.The acting is bad, the effects are bad, the writing is bad and I'm happy because I rented this.Save your money of better yet, if you need a nap rent this because you're likely to get a really good nap.Not sure what's wrong with others who have compared this to TLOTR. This movie is nothing like the TLORT with the obvious exemption of attempting to make the poster a look alike.Amazon needs a ""Hate it it"" option or a ""No Star"" for movies like this."
2,Like LOTR? someone needs new glasses...,"To compare this low budget 2nd class production with LOTR is an insult to LOTR... the graphics are so evident to be CGI, the scenery is so clearly artificial, and the story, OK, just more of the same. Not even the characters and creatures are original."
2,Beware of shining reviews,"Poorly acted, poor special effects, just a down right poor movie, and stupid besides. DON'T BUY THIS!"
1,just plain horrible...,this movie is full of bad acting and cheap special effects. i couldn't even finish this movie. please don't waste your time with this LOTR knock-off. :(
1,Saw only half had to stop,very bad actingvary bad plotvary bad costumesvery bad special effectsall in all very bad movie if I should compare it to Lord of the rings that movie would deserve 10 stars ! this totslly waste of money sorry to say so even Legend of the seeker worth 3 stars
3,Knights of Bloodsteel,"This was an interesting movie with some unusual twists in its' characters. It was a little lacking in depth, but still enjoyable."
5,One of the best shows ever,"I would have to say this is one of the best shows on tv, Adult swim has made another classic. The characters(sp?) are unique and funny, the storys actually tackle meaningful and real issues. Pick this up you'll be happy you did."
5,Must See,"Would be good if they had a clean version with all the 'beeping' still in it, but this DVD set is awesome. Boondocks goes places TV wishes it could and does it extremely well. Riley and Huey are great characters. Gim Rummy is the funniest. Next DVD set of season 2 has to include a soundtrack with it. If you read the comic strip or just like good animation that takes on 'different' topics, Boondocks is for you."
5,COMEDY CARTOON,"THIS IS A GREAT CARTOON FOR THE GROWN UP'S, I WILL BE GLAD WHEN THE NEXT ADDITION COMES OUT."
5,OMG GET THIS.... CLASSIC!,You wanna know what its like for a Black person as a kid? Check this out! Its a sign of the times classic work of comedic genius!
4,Great Quick Service on Boondocks 1St Season Box Set,This DVD set arrived within days of placing the order. The physical DVD's were in great shape. I'm happy with this purchase
5,Brilliant comedy,I have been an adamant watcher of this show since i first discovered it. I have not yet purchased the DVD but believe it to be excellent intellectualy stimulating comedy. I am also an avid fan of Southpark and carlos mencia if that helps you make up your mind one way or another. The comedy can be a little dark and off beat sometimes but then again thats the stuff i like best. This show has thsome of the greatest and most unforgettable characters i've ever seen. All things considered i highly recommend this show and plan to buy the season on DVD soon. Hopefully it will be full of extra's and who Knows maybe they'll give Uncle Ruckus his own show.
3,Political propaganda disguised as a how.,"I will keep this review short and simple. This show has some great ideas and interesting directions...but get lost in the constant political dialogue that overtakes the humour and leaves a sour taste in the viewer.As a show it fails to entertain but as a satirical comic strip it certainly does the deed. I feel that show should ""humanize"" the characters more instead of constantly boxing them in with ""racial topics"" and limiting their potential to develop as characters.I watched this show with the best and most optimistic mindset but it really dissapointed me. It tried to inject intelligent arguments with humour a'la ""South Park"" but got lost in its own propaganda....like Spike Lee's latest films. The comic strip did a much better job at finding humour in stereotypes...I wonder why this 30 minute series didn't?Oh well...maybe season two will be better"
4,a cartoon that make sense,"yes, this is it. Great logic. The profanity can be cut other than that. IT is better than the simpsons."
3,great movie but does not live up to the hype,"Once again a film is touted as ""the most horrible, shocking thing ever committed to film"" and it turns out to be anything but. Sure this film is dark, nihilistic, gritty, disturbing but I wouldn't even place it in the top 5 most disturbing films I've ever seen.This is a very, very, very good movie though. The performances and direction were stellar and while the voice-over was an effective way of aiding the viewer in understanding the protagonist it was a tad annoying from time to time.Judging by the reactions of the other reviewers perhaps I'm a tad more desensitized than the average person so this film might be the most horrible thing you've ever seen. However, if you've seen Henry, Salo, Cannibal Holocaust, and other similar films I suspect you'll see this is more of a ""very good"" film than a ""shockingly disturing"" one."
2,Whats so disturbing about it?,"i want to say first of all that i quite enjoyed this film, but i did not find it disturbing AT ALL! i was expecting it to be more disturbing than irreversbel after reading some of the revews but it comes nowere close ,but over all it is a better film"
1,ZERO STARS - COMPLETE CRAP,"I spent over $20 for this movie. I was looking for a 'roller-coaster' ride - but wound up with a slow trolley on a tour. Firstly, it has ABSOLUTELY nothing of what it claims - the only violent scene is when the butcher (butcher, as in had once owned a meat store) beats some broad he knocked up. . . and as for the graphic sex, well, the butcher treats himself to a movie, and that movie is porn. All the while the butcher just drones on and on about his mediocre existence and how hard life is. PUH-LEEZE - this is no work of art - it's absolute crap."
3,Not that shocking,"I expected more ""shock"" from reading the reviews. It is not that violent in my opinion. Resevior Dogs was worse IMO."
3,See It,"If you are even looking at this title, you must already be somewhat interested in this film. my advice is get it, blind buy or not. it is extremely well done. the film is very dark in subject matter, and ignoring the graphic hard core sex shown briefly when the character goes to a porn theater, the movie is rather tame. The violence is, of course, violent. But it is very seldom and not ""gory"". Just based on word of mouth i picked up this disc and was not let down. easily one of the better blind buys i have made. the DVD is barebone and this title will probablly never see a SE (atleast in region 1.) the transfer and audio is decent. stop reading and put it in your cart."
1,piece of crap,"A 50 year old French man who is an utter failure at life stops trying and just starts reacting. He is utterly confused on how to live his life. Anything that remotely will change the way he feels he reaches for: violence, incest, beating up his wife, whatever. Nothing is resolved in this film. The main protagonist is an idiot. If you enjoy spending time with this sort of character then you may enjoy the film. This film was done many times better by Scorcese when it was called Taxi Driver."
2,Quite Disappointing,"The workmanship was mediocre, the colour was a dark navy blue unlike the picture, and the size was way too big. I normally take large in t-shirts, but read the site and ordered smaller to a medium size. Even that was too big. Several years ago when I was in the U.K. I bought my sons Celtic T-shirts they were quaility and beautiful. Sorry I cannot recomend this."
1,A few problems with this order.,"I will be returning this item. This is what I searched for on Amazon: ""100% organic cotton men's Large T-shirt Celtic design made in USA.""This item popped up so I checked the product details and ordered it. However, when it arrived, the label said ""XL"" although I ordered a ""Large."" The label said made in/assembled in ""Mexico"" in addition to ""USA."" The product reeked of an unpleasant odor. If I order an item with 100% organic cotton, I certainly expect low-impact dyes."
2,"OK in quality, but there are better guides","I've read different guides on Japan and Tokyo, do to several trips I made over the years. Even trough there are some Lonely Planets I found really great - especially the earlier ones on China and Southeast Asia - this one seems to have copied a lot from other guide books. I tried hard but didn't find much new and unique information. And there are no walking tours, so you have to do homework before you start exploring. In my view, there are some much better guides"
4,You'll be lost without it,"Tokyo is not an 'easy' Asian city like Bangkok, Jakarta or Singapore. In Tokyo you can be truly lost, unless you are with locals. Despite my experience as a continuous traveller, I have been literally lost in Tokyo many times - entering pharmacies which I thought were restaurants, looking for inexisting cash machines, wandering around the underground without realizing how many networks there are... This book may not be great, in fact it does have some lacks. Yet, by all means, it is a great tool to feel more comfortable in this Asian capitaly, and also to enjoy it."
4,talent totally locked up,"bought ist album in 74, and was instantly amazed at the talent,good voices,but not promoted properly,a real shame."
2,Difficult to play with,"There are too many things to hook up to make this doll work. She poses when you turn the lense ring. My daughter would have preferred her to pose when she pressed down the shutter button. My daughter is almost 5 years old. She begged for it, played with it once, and has since left it alone due to difficulty."
4,Great new book!,"I enjoyed Ms. Ferguson's book very much. Not only was the plot good, original and believable, but I learned a great deal about harvesting sea urchins, a creature I am totally unfamiliar with. All in all an excellent first novel."
5,Finally Inspiring Stories on LGBT lives,"The best thing about this book is it is set up to inspire. So many stories from the community are about overcoming hardship, but this one strives to show how wonderous the lives of LGBT people actually are. Rather than focusing only on the challenges and overcoming them that LGBT people face in society, this book shows that far from carrying a burden through life, being LGBT opens us to new ideas and creativity that a life ""outside of the box"" can bring and extolls the freedom that such a life brings. This book will uplift and inspire the spirit within all of us."
5,Best Vintage Catalog in The World!!!,"There is no doubt that Lou Tannens Catalogs where and still the best in the world, since no ones has been able to duplicate their extensive line of products. It's also very unfortunately that they dont have these catalogs available and their store in New York are about the worse providers of Magic Tricks and lack of customer service.The era of a good Magic Shop is gone but if you like to see the list of all Magic Tricks in one place, then you can confidently buy any of these collectors catalogs!Magician Rasputin[...]"
4,A Great Book!!,"This book was wonderfully descriptive and transported you to a place perhapse centuries from now, or just around the corner. The author combines the traveler's description of ""Forefather"" things in such a way that the reader can grasp what he is talking about. The plot is wonderful, with emphasis on both the character's and their lives, and the condition on the world after a horrific war. A must read book for anyone.!!"
5,Use it all the time.,"I use this all of the time, it makes my hair shiny and soft without adding weight like regular leave in conditioners."
4,different fragrance,loved the deep shine lusterizer for what it did to my hair and for its fragrance - it made my hair smell like I just swam in the ocean - now it smells like all the other Rusk leave-in products.it still works well with my hair but I will look for something else now.
3,Okay,"It is super humid in this area of Texas and it really didn't do to much for my hair. I will use it, but will see if my daughter has better luck with this. Did not control my fly aways."
2,All Products,"I am usually satisfied with any product I purchase from Amazon. I do not usually rate products. If it is a good product and I like it I will buy it again. If not, I won't. That says it all. Personally, I don't like to be told to rate products or how many words I should use. Very often, I purchase a product and don't use it for weeks, or I order it for someone or give it as a gift, and may have no idea how well the product works or not. So please, no reminder to rate products every time I purchase something. Thanks."
3,Product might be old...,"It would seem one could get such a deal with buying online however, the product smells older, although packaged well for a no spill journey and works the same way as a newer product I can't quite get over the smell. The product itself I've been using for years, and it works well on blow dried hair but is a little heavy if you're going to flat iron. There are better products for keeping a bit of volume if there's going to be flat ironing, such as mop's leave in conditioner and paul mitchell's leave in conditioner. Rusk gives a sleek, frizz free look and will work well with naturally moderately curly hair."
3,It was OKAY.,"My hair is 18"" long. Im african american. But my hair is REAL. Its not that thick kind of medium texture. I used it and it hardly curled my hair. It gave me a VERY loose wave type thing. I dont even know what to call it. So it sucked for me. But my sister on the other hand has the total opposite type hair its a little shorter than mine and way thicker. She has a weave and it worked on her hair! My hair is 100% natural and healthy and it sucked on mine :( So i gave it 3 stars because it works. But i guess it depends on your hair type."
5,Just what I needed!,"The size is good, which I expected. The manner in which the hair wraps around the cylinder is great. With short hair it is sometimes difficult to get it where I want it on the curling iron and to keep it there."
2,No curl at all,Nice style curling iron but did not seem to be able to put the slightest curl in my hair. I have another kind the same size but much cheaper where I am able to get curl and body.
1,Defective Item,I was very enthusiastic upon awaiting for this curler and it turned out to be defective. What more can I say-Very disappointed!
2,Cord shorted out,Power cord started to shore out a year and a half into use. I only use this at home and am not a stylist so it wasn't heavy use. I called the company and the product is only warranted for a year. The replacement cost was $21 but buy the time you pay for shipping both ways what's the point? My revlon brand iron lasted many years longer. Needless to say I'm disappointed since it's suppose to be a professional item that it died after light home use.
3,takes a lot of patience to learn how to use the iron,The tourmaline curling iron is a well made product with multiple temp settings; however it takes a lot of patience to learn how to use the iron. I found that once I finished doing my hair it looked great.
1,was USED and had glue like substance all over it,"This product was supposed to be new and it had scratches all over it, there was also some sort of glue like substance that left alot of residue on your hands whenever you touched any part of it that was plastic"
5,Great product,"Bought this as a gift for a relative. It's super light, easy to use and well worth what I paid for it!"
2,Sticky handle,I not happy with the product i recieved the curling iron and the handle had a sticy glue i have not hear from hot tools to mail it backI did send a email also
2,Not Long Lasting,Neither the curling results or iron itself are long lasting. The biggest annoyance was that it died on me after less than a year of using it once per week. I have had straightening and curling irons that have lasted 5 yrs + on average.
4,Very special,He was very cool and has used more than once and liked it a lotBut I need to training on different types of hairstyles to be skilled in the use of
2,Would not buy again,I may just be stupid but I can curl my hair fine with a flat iron. I thought I'd get this to add variety to the curls but it does not work. I have watched videos and tried everything. It does not work unless I keep it on my hair for an insane amount of time. Takes a long time to curl and does not get too hot though I burn my fingers often on it. Would not buy again or suggest.
3,Just so so,"I can't even find the manual of this item. I search the website, no video instructions for this item. I don't know how to use it."
1,this sucks!!! DO NOT BUY EVER,I was really excited about getting this. It finally came and i opened it and tried it out. DIDNT WORK! sure it gets hot and turns on but the point of a curling iron is to make curls right?. it only flipped my hair because the second the curling iron let go of my hair it came undone. everyone in this house has tried it on my hair and no one can figure out why it isnt working the box says works on all hair types so why is mine the exception? I KNOW its the curler thats cheap. it is made by helen of troy products which look cheap and are! If i would have known then i wouldnt have wasted my time and money on this sucky product. I am getting a refund and no one can tell me otherwise!!!!
1,Need to return item. Can't get response by phone or email.,The item was not what I wanted so I tried to get instructions for a return by both phone and email and get no response.
1,"Hot Tools Curling Iron Spring Grip 1/2"" (Purchased on 05/25/2010)",I have not receieved this order yet! Can you pelase update the expected ship date?!
1,Way too big!,"I have really long, wavy, normal (nor thick nor thin) hair, and this curling iron is huge! I wasn't able to make a single curl on my hair!!! it only allows me to roll 3 times the hair on the iron, and no matter how long do I leave it on my hair it doesn't curl at all!! leaves an awful wave on the hair, I even prefer my hair as it is. If you have medium or short hair don't even think about it. I don't recommend this product at all!"
5,"1/2"" hot tools spring curling iron","This is the only place I could find this size curling iron which I have used for years as I have really short hair. It's great, professional model that really holds the heat and the iron lasts for years. I bought two to be on the ""safe"" side. Prompt shipment and great price. Thanks."
5,Great smaller barrel curling iron,"I bought one of these in 2000 and it lasted for 9 years. The spring went out, but I ordered another one this year and it came with extra springs so it appears that it should last even longer. The curling iron is hot within seconds. The clamp holds tightly so that hair does not slip out easily until it is released. The swivel works great so that the cord does not twist up. I have a larger barrel of this same brand and love it as well. I have owned many brands and this outshines them all."
3,just as the rating it's okay,It's not fantastic as I thought it would have been but maybe it's my hair. It still came fast and it was okay
5,Hot Tools are the Best,I love the Hot Tools brand and this one curling iron is great. I'll have to put this one away since I had my hair cut short. I'll save it when my hair is longer.
1,Spring issues,Purchased about 6 1/2 months ago and the spring just went out on it so it will not close to hold the hair.
5,Wonderful Cruling Iron,"I had a curling iron of this same brand for about 10 years, it was a wonderful iron, but the spring finally broke. I bought a replacement at Sally's, but I would not recommend buying anything there. It was expensive and a piece of junk! I tried to return it, apparantely customer satisfaction is not important to a company that sells low quality junk. I came home and ordered this iron on Amazon for half the price, what a delight this curling iron is. It heats up wonderfully, has a nice long barrel and even came with extra springs. I'll bet this one lasts 20 years!!! :) If you are in the market for a curling iron you won't be dissappointed, but don't shop at Sally's."
1,Worked great...until it BROKE,I loved this curling iron until it broke about 6 months later. It's too bad because I had a curling iron that was ten to fifteen years old and it worked like a charm until it finally broke about a year ago. Ugh... It's so frustrating!!!!!
2,Ordered and paid for a 1'' curling iron and got a 3/8'' one,"That's it, I ordered a 1'' curling iron but I got a 3/8'' and I can't return it because it's already out of the US so it isn't under guarantee anymore. I didn't knew they sent me the wrong size until it was in my hands here, in my country.Nevertheless, the thing works perfectly. I already bought a 1 1/2'' and it is amazing, I love it!!Those 2 stars are because now I have to wait for another chance that some acquaintance goes to the US, so as I will buy another curling iron (hoping they send me the right one this time...) and this person will bring it to me when they are back in the country... but only God knows when will that be... Damn you, Hot Tools people and thank you, by the way!SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH!! :S"
4,Good curling iron,This product is good. I like the heat setting and design. My hair however refuses to hold a curl for more than 10 minutes despite and gel or spray I put in. I've also tried wrapping my hair around the barrel. No luck! It's too dried out I guess... But overall this is a good product.
2,"hot tools curling iron 1.5""",i have somewhat long hair and wanted loose curls. this doesnt even do a wave. i was not impressed. even with hairspray it never had a curl. my hair is easy to work with and it just didnt work for me. it straightened more than anything. i guess its good for doing the bangs in front because who wants curly bangs.
3,So-so,"I heard great things about this curling iron but when I used it, it's not anything special. My CVS bought Conair works just as good."
3,Ceramic Tourmaline is better,"I have the purple ceramic tourmaline Hot Tools curling iron that is also 1 1/2"" and I loved it, but the springs wore out and I threw away my extra springs that came with it... So I bought this one because it was a little cheaper... It works well, but I am very long, very thick hair, and the ceramic curling iron works SO much better! Much better hold than this gold plated one. I suggest spending just a little more and getting the ceramic one! :)"
2,Melted my hair,"I never write reviews but in this case I had to.I will start with bad stuff... In general the Extra Hot heat mode should NOT exist on this curling iron.... I doubt that there is a person whose hair wont melt when it is subjected to such heat... I accidentally turned the nob to the wrong side (towards extra hot). Guess what, it dried my hair to the point that it didn't curl anymore...and then when I touched, it it fell right off....2 inch long piece of a thick curl just fell right off...... I understand that I had to realize that extra hot is EXTRA hot...But seriously, such setting should not even exist..... Oh, and I did not hold it for too long b/c I didn't want crazy spiral shapes...just a little waviness.When I was trying to check the rest of my hair for melted/dried pieces my heart was racing and hands shaking.... So, Girls be careful...Overall, it curls nice, wide curls and does its job... as long as its not on Extra hot setting."
1,"Truly Awful, Don't Buy","After doing some research on Amazon I decided to ask for this curling iron for Christmas on my amazon list. My sister got it for me. I used it 4 times. The second time, on the lowest setting, it FRIED my hair. It is truly frizzled/fried in places, which is very distressing. After talking to my stylist and buying some heat protective spray, I tried it again. It seemed OK for 2 more uses, then stopped working entirely. The power indicator light goes on, but it does not heat up AT ALL. This happened right before an important professional meeting I had to travel to, which I had to attend with flat hair.Re-reading the reviews I see that other people have had a similar if not identical experience. It is probably the worst product I've ever gotten. And I can't return it because it was a present plus I threw away the packaging. I recommend that you AVOID THIS PRODUCT. I will never buy a ""Hot Tools"" product again."
3,"Great curling iron, but NOT for THIN hair!","Don't get me wrong, this is a great and solid curling iron that will give you nice waves and last you lifetime, but it's simply not for people with thin hair. Every time I clip my hair to curl, it slips off since my hair is so thin. I have thin, long Asian hair and I even tried to put more hair onto the clip, but when I do that, the curls are not as defined and even. If you have thin hair like mine, opt for Babybliss' Pro Ceramic Tools curling iron. They clip even my baby hairs and holds well when I curl and this is the only iron I've even bought EVER that could do this! Also, it's cheaper, too! :-)"
5,Great Curling Iron,"I was previously using a Conair curling iron, and this Hot Tools curling iron has been so much better. I love all of the heat settings, and it gets hot enough to curl my hair, and the curl holds for hours!"
4,My Rating on Hot Tools HT1109 Midi Professional Curling Iron,"i gave it 4 stars, because I do like the product. My hair is fine, and the product holds it in place while curling. It seems reasonably priced also. I have had two of these before, and they died on me before year-end. It does have a year warranty. The first one I did not return, but the last one I am returning, since I kept all the info on it. Hopefully Hot Tools will replace it; I'd like to have an extra on hand just in case this last purchase does the same thing."
3,Hot Tools 1.5 inch Curling Iron,"The clamp is a little too tight, resulting in a dent in the hair if the hair isn't rolled around the iron right away. It may be a good idea to not use the clamp at all. The iron has about 10 heat settings, which is nice, but I find setting 4 to be enough for my needs."
5,great product,"Excellent product. I would highly recommend it for thick curly or frizzy hair. Other curling irons I have tried either did not reach the necessary heat level, or started out hot then cooled down as styling proceeded. This curling iron keeps a very even heat level at the setting I choose using the dial on the side of the handle. The controls are conveniently positioned without being in the way. The iron does get extremely hot, however, so be careful around the scalp. There was absolutely no damage to my hair at settings over 400 degrees, and at this level of heat I can finish in about half the usual time I was taking with a 'cooler' iron."
3,"Good product, but i bought the wrong size barrel","I will not say this is a bad product, it just was not for me.I believe I purchased the wrong size barrel for my needs. The iron has adjustable heat settings. Its highest setting is really hot, so be careful not scortch your hairThis iron is easy to use, easy to maneuver but 1.5 inch barrel is pretty big to think you are getting real curlsI should have bought the 1 or 1.4 inch."
2,My curls don't last,"I was excited to receive this after reading all the great reviews about it. I tried it and my curls were gorgeous at first, but after an hour they were barely wavy. At first I only used the TreSemme heat protectant spray, and later I tried hairspray and a curling mousse while using this curling iron at the hottest setting and holding it for 30 seconds on each curl. Even with all of that the curls wouldn't last more than an hour. This is my first curling iron so I can't say that it's worse or better than other curling irons...or maybe there's something wrong with my hair. I hope the rest of you have better luck!"
4,Great for long hair,"I love just about everything about this curling iron except that it does catch my hair a little bit when pull it down the length of my hair. Even though it does this, it doesn't rip it out. No other complaints."
3,1-1/2 inch curling iron,"My hair typically does not hold a curl but with lots of hairspray I can get pretty soft waves with this iron (although they straighten out within a few hours). I think a ceramic barrel would have worked better. The size of the barrel is good for creating soft waves. The iron is ok for the price, but I would not recommend it for hair that does not hold curls well."
2,Lowest setting is too hott for my hair,"Good curling irons as far as quality. I bought these because I wanted to add little more body and bounce to my hair that flat irons cannot do. They don't look cheap or flimsy. I've used it maybe 3 times and am quite impressed, however, I was a little irritated by the heating preferences. The heating element goes from 280 to 430. I wish there was a lower setting than 280. For me, 280 is just too hot. I am really big on hair health and I always try to use the lowest heat setting possible to prevent breakage or damage.. Perhaps if it went down to 200, it would be better. These curling irons work very well but I am not very satisfied with the heating preferences so I will probably continue to look for something better."
4,Pleased,"This is just what I was looking for. I was apprehensive because other reviews said it burned hair off, but I have no idea why that would happen. I have thicker hair, but still my straightener has a similar heat setting so I don't see why the heat would be too strong. Creates large, natural looking curls like I wanted. Great for longer hair and more natural looking curls."
1,Doesn't work,I didn't get any curls from this. There were marks from the clamp left in my hair and it fried my hair into frizz. I got maybe 1 or two curls and that's after trying to curl all my hair.
4,Hot Tools Professional 1102 Curling Iron,Very nice looking and it really looks professional. Heats quickly and has several settings. The only problem I have is the stand. It tips the iron forward leaving the hot iron touching my counter. I don't want the hot iron resting on my counter thinking it might burn so I leave the wire at the end of the iron hang off the counter and it seems to balance the iron properly. It also comes with several extra springs. I've never had to replace springs on any iron and I use irons for years so I question this. There's also an order form to order more springs.
5,Pleased,I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas. She loves it and says it works better than her last one. (I haven't used it but I can vouch that the curls look great.) Great price too. : - )Edit: It has been almost a year and the curling iron is still functional. The curls are as beautiful as ever!
1,Does not reach temperature,"After several tries, I could not figure out why this iron will not curl my hair. So I exchanged it for a new one. New one will not curl my hair. Makes curls, curls go straight. My hair is not difficult to curl, and I can make it curly just by twisting it around my finger and waiting for it to dry (takes a long time to dry, though). My old, broken curling iron that burns my fingers when I use it will set a curl into my hair that does not come out. Supposedly this one gets hotter. On a whim, I tested it with my Raytek Infrared Thermometer. The hottest part of this iron was 325F at the very center. Which should still be hot enough to make a curl that holds. Most of the rest of the wand was 285F. Since I've had it too long now to return it, I may just take it apart and see if I can't ""fix"" it myself. Waste of money."
1,Terrible design,"I purchased this curling iron at a salon. Almost from the first use, I became aware of an obvious--horrible--design flaw: the handle for opening the curling iron is mostly made of flexible metal, so that with repeated use, the handle bends down until you can no longer open the iron. Each time this happens, the handle must be bent back up, which is extremely frustrating. Obviously, after many repetitions, the handle finally breaks off. I just duct-taped my broken handle so I don't burn myself, and I am now looking for another brand. Verdict: truly awful design."
5,Love it!,As promised!! This is the exact curling iron my stylist uses at half the price. I'm really pleased with this purchase.
5,Good product,Would buy again. Like the large iron. Worth the money (a good deal) and came recommended by our stylist. We ordered it for a Christmas gift thru Amazon.
4,hot tools,"This curling iron gets hot much quicker than my old one, but it's a little heavier than I'm used to. Quality construction."
1,Design flaw - lever springs wear out quickly,"My wife has had several of these and loves them - until the lever spring (that gives it the clamping action) fails. The spring has a little metal roller on it that - after repeated use - wears out and slides down to the base of the spring. When that happens the clamping action of the lever is gone. They maker obviously knows about the design flaw because they include one extra spring in the box. That's great if you didn't throw it out with the box and are handy enough (and have a screwdriver) to replace it when needed. Unfortunately, the spring seems to wear out after ~6 months of daily use.Like many others I'm getting tired of throwing things out prematurely so at my urging my wife is looking for another brand this time around. Problem is they all seem to be made in China - which is where the quality seems to be the most questionable. Any brand suggestions?"
5,Best Curling Iron,This is the best curling iron I have ever used - I will never buy another brand again. I highly recommend it.
2,Horrible!!,"I usually never do this, write reviews, but I hate this curling iron i've owned it for a week now. I curl my hair everyday and this curling iron doesn't hold the curl. I decided to buy it for a replacement and after seeing the great reviews I thought okay i'll give a try, I have a Hot Tools straightner for 5 years already and it still works like the first day I bought it but this curling iron for me is a disapointment."
1,This curling iron hasn't worked right since I received it!!,This was a replacement curling iron. I had the exact one and was extremely happy with it for several years. The spring broke on my first one and it would no long hold my hair when I used it. The new iron spring already sounds like it is going to break. Sometimes it doesn't hold my hair and I have to force it to close. I don't think it will last long at all!! This was not a good purchase!!
4,Hot Tools Curling iron spring,"I have used this curling iron for about a year now. I love the curling iron but I am on the last of the two ""extra"" springs it comes with. The curling iron still works like new. I hate throwing a good product in the trash if it can be avoided. Does anyone know if/where the extra springs can be purchased? Thanks!."
2,Loved it until it died!,"This iron was great until it died today. I purchased this just 2 years ago and used it maybe once a week. I have other curling irons I've had 10 years that still work - and they were cheaper! I'm am extremely disappointed, given the high ratings and the apppearance of high quality of this product. I am bummed!"
1,Its broken already!,"I bought this curling iron in June 2010. I use it once a day most days. I loved using it until last month, it stopped working. There may be a short, because if I fuss with it, I can get it to turn on sometimes. Looks like I'm throwing it in the trash. I'm frustrated, my cheaper low end irons have lasted 5+ years...this Hot Tools iron lasting only 20 months...lame."
1,Only lasted 1 year,"This curling iron gets very hot and makes very nice curls. I liked it so much I bought a smaller size too and was considering buying a medium sized one. Then one day while I was curling my hair, it popped and began to smoke. It no longer works. I expect a product like this to have a longer life that the one year I got out of it. It was MADE IN CHINA and so maybe I should have expected that it was not a quality product. In general CHINESE quality control isn't very good or doesn't exist at all. Lesson learned."
4,Wo0oW but !!,hiits very good itembutthe Head conductor of electricity is smallso you should buy another big head to can you use the iron.
5,Professional Curling Iron,I like how fine you can make your settings for heat and I find that these tools are very durable.
4,Great curling iron,This curling iron heats up really quick and works well. I think I will go with a slightly smaller barrel next time.
5,The best,"I love this iron, it is such a good product for the money. I left my first one on a trip and had to get another since my store bought conair irons were so bad, no comparison. Buy this you will be glad you did"
4,Looks Legit.,"This is a gift for my sister, i haven't used it yet, but delivery was fast. and it looks professional. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,This is the greatest curling iron I've ever used.,"My hair doesn't usually hold curl well, but this curling iron works wonders! My curls stay in all day and night. Depending on how you use it, you can create a couple of different looks/styles with the 1"". I highly recommend this curling iron for any hair type.My old roommate got me hooked on this brand. Her mom had a salon and Hot Tools were what they used and I can totally see why. Great brand and products from them."
4,Great Product!,"For all those burning your hair off, turn down the temperature!Great product, it's not as sturdy as I'd like but it gets the job done. Really like that the temperature goes from really low to super high, great for saving time, just rack it up to the max and then bring it down.It's a little on the slippery side and while I wish I had gotten the 1 1/2 (was it 2 in?), it still works great for tight or large curls.Would recommend!"
5,Great,I love this curling iron! It arrived at my house on time and it works really well. I would recommend it to anyone
2,Impossible to keep the handle clean,"I like this curling iron in every aspect except for the fact that the handle is now gooey and stuck with hair, and nothing I have tried will take it off. It's going in the trashcan. Sorry Hot Tools! Try another type of plastic."
1,odd woman out?,"I read the reviews on this iron about people with fine hair having a lot of good luck with this curling iron, so I was sad when it didn't work for me. Even though I didn't expect the curl to last long, even with a ton of hairspray and all the other tricks I've tried over the years, my hair was completely flat in less than 30 minutes. Other curling irons have at least left a little curl on the ends and the look of hair that's been curled that day. I got neither from this iron. I would not recommend it, and am probably going to return it or try to sell it to someone else."
4,loooove it!!!!,I recently bought my Hot tools curler and i love it alot!!! I can set the heat setting to the temperature that i want and it all depends on i want my hair to be curly. Great tool if you are looking for to create those loose curls.
2,want waves? this is too big,"I bought this curling iron hoping to achieve the celebrity ""wave"". Like this[...]I have straight, fine, hard to curl, medium-long length(bra length) hair. I sprayed my dry hair with hairspray lightly, and curled, in sections, like every tutorial says to do but my result was not successful. It flipped out the ends of my hair and thats it. No curl, no wave. Two hours later my hair was FLAT.Maybe I'm doing something wrong? But I think this iron is just too big. I returned it and purchased the 1-14"" iron. Maybe the 1/4"" will make a difference? Or maybe someone can give me some tips?"
1,poor shipping and handling,"Hi the item that I have received was bent, looks used, and also shortage of connection. I was not happy at all. Ill like to know what is the process of returning my item as in how long would it take and what is the cost."
1,Hot Tools Curling Iron,"AWFUL EXPERIENCE! Used curling iron for the first time on low heat and FRIED my hair right off! The second time I tried to turn it on, it no longer heated up. Must have been a short in the curling iron or it was defective. I'm out the money I paid since it was opened from the package & still don't have a working curling iron...Will never purchase Hot Tools again!!!!!"
4,"Good curling iron, but curls don't hold for very long","I like this curling iron because it heats up fast, and gets pretty hot. It is nice there is an option to change the heat setting but I usually just have it cranked to the highest heat. That said, the curls do not hold as well as with other irons I've had in the past, they start to fall out within even half an hour sometimes. Also, I wish there was a better stand to rest this on the counter - the top half is so heavy, the stand doesn't hold it up (although it has a nice thick cool part at the head, perhaps for that reason)."
2,Not the right hair type?,"Based on the reviews, I thought this purchase was a no-brainer, but this curling iron just doesn't work in my hair. I've used other curling irons for nearly twenty years for spirals, waves, etc., and have always gotten good hold until this one. I'm completely perplexed by this because I've never had issues in the past. It's definitely getting hot, but my hair comes off the rod nearly straight, and what little curl there is (when there is any at all) falls right out within a minute or two. I wanted this for body, not curls, but it doesn't even do that. And yes, I've tried adding my styling products both before and after; it makes absolutely no difference. Bummer."
5,Good quality,This is not the first time I have used this product. I love it and the price was better than Sallys
2,not what i expected,"This iron is a bit on the heavy side and snagged and pulled my hair and left it dry dull and lifeless, i actually had parts that looked burnt and crumbled to the touch and i was not even to the extremely hot setting , this is just a metal barrel the gold blah blah is non sense, i have a paul mitchell straightner which is soo smooth and adds shine to my hair probably i ll try the curling iron from same brand."
5,Great tool,"I have vey thick, wavy, shoulder length hair. This iron works very well. I turn it up to almost 8. It gets vey hot and does nice curls that last."
2,Poor design,"The problem with this hair curler is in the cord to the curler connection method. This is the second one that has had the same problem, intermittent power when the cord is wiggled. It may be useful for the cord to swivel around, but it is a problematic design. The end of the cord is connected to the iron using two coiled wires that tranmit power. If a break occurs in the cord inside this end then the power is intermittent. Hot Tools refuses to sell a replacement cord which would easily fix the problem since the iron is fine otherwise. Just want you to buy a new one with the same flaw. Look for another brand."
2,This is a weak and imitative pseudo-thriller.,"I predict that this book will sink quickly without a trace. ""Mortal Judgments"" (how's that for an original title) is a forgettable entry into the already overcrowded legal-medical thriller genre. It has an overly complicated and not too coherent plot with characters so forgettable that as soon as I closed the book, I had to strain to remember what I had read. No cliche is left unused in this tired plot: the mysterious and unexplained death in the operating room, the spunky heroine (who is both a doctor and a lawyer), the corpses that pile up because they are getting TOO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH. The ending is anticlimactic and rather dull, as our heroine finds herself chased by her assailants. Will she survive? This is a yawn."
2,"Nice picture, very expensive to maintain","Have had PT-40LC12 for two years now and have experienced the same problems other reviewers have mentioned -- 2 lamps in 2 years at $330 each. Now the lamp ballast has gone bad and that will run another $1,000 for parts and labor.Have heard lamps and lamp ballasts are an issue with all LCD and DLP rear projection, but can only cite my personal experience here."
1,Nothing but problems,"I first purchased this TV a few weeks ago. After a week or so, I noticed that on certain cable channels (analog, not digital) the audio was out of sync with the video. This was usually in the range of 0.1 - 0.5 second lead in the audio. Confused, I watched some movies and it did the same thing. Thinking it was a problem with the TV, I had the only person I knew with a truck drive 2 hours to my house to bring it back, we brought it back no problem, got the new TV, that person left, and the TV then wouldn't turn on. Extremely aggrevated, I called the place where I purcahsed it and they agreed to deliver a new one for no charge. I got the new one and it has the same audio out of sync problem as the original, except sometimes it seems worse. This happens on the both the HDMI, and component outputs of the DVD player (and yes I did try a different DVD player). So either the store gave me back the original, or panasonic needs to review their schematics."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"Have a PT-45LC that is two years old. Have had to replace the lamp 5 times, at $300 a lamp, and now the ballast or something else is blown and the TV needs servicing. Nearly $2,000 just to run the TV for two years! We follow all the suggestions and are nuts about cleaning the filter, but the set just eats up bulbs. They last about 1,000 hours, not the 4,000-5,000 hours Panasonic claims, just long enough to be OFF of the 6 month warrantee. One lamp blew while under warrantee and it took 4 weeks for them to replace it. NICE! Unless you have money to burn, don't buy a Panasonic Projection TV. The company doesn't care about your satisfaction, and the product stinks."
2,Wall Map,I purchased the map quite sometime ago and made the mistake not to check it thoroughly. There was damage to the laminate in the center and it is still sitting in a closet waiting for possible repair.
3,Worth the price,"The word ""laminated"" made me expect something a little thicker and heavier that what arrived. I guess it means it's been treated so you can write on it? It's worth it for the price, though."
2,Laminated World Map,"The quality of the map is fine, however the clamps that hold the map up are not very good. It keeps falling of the wall. Finally I just threw away the hangers and nailed it straight to the wall."
5,Excellent,Bought this for my teenage daughter who loves it. It's bigger than expected. Everything is very clearly marked and readable.
4,Big Map,"I love maps, bought this to plan out my future travels.I'm hoping to go to Anguilla for a month's vacation, or maybe two but couldn't find it on the map,lol. So this big map is missing one location. The shipping was not the best, it had a crease right down the center of the map.It should have been put in a cardboard/PVC sleeve for safe shipping.All in all i give it 4 Stars."
4,Good but not exactly as expected.,"I was expecting this map to come laminated in the sense it would lay flat and not come rolled in a tube. It's just a more sturdy, shinier paper than regular ones, but it can still crease and wrinkle easily if your not careful. It at least came with attached plastic strips along the top and bottom to add some height so it would hang flatter. Other than that, it's still a good, easy to read political map."
4,"good enough for the price, arrived rolled up and flattened.","The map is large and sturdy, perfect for our purpose. It arrived rolled up in a tube, which got flattened in shipping, but it looks fine on the wall. Overall, perfectly appropriate for the price."
3,Purchased for CFO office,"we all have wall maps in our offices at work so the new CFO needed to have one. This map is the right size and has a good color scheme. Unfortunately it could not be used because the ""frame"" was not substantial enough to stand up to the duration of transportation."
2,weak lamination,"This poster is glossed, not laminated and will definitely not pass pass the test of time in a class room..."
3,Great looking poster Inadequate packaging,This poster looks really nice. I ordered it for my classroom and have already received numerous complements on its appearance.My major gripe with this was the packaging. poster is laminated and was somehow bent during the shipping process. there is now a noticeable line of wrinkles that run down the poser. Nothing worth sending it back for- but a little annoying.-I would recommend this item be shipped in a tube rather than a box.
2,Nice Map - Horrible Shipping,"The map arrived rolled up. That would have been fine it wasn't also totally smashed. The end result was a map that was all rippled and, had I actually needed it for more than one night, I would have returned it. Not sure who's bright idea it was to roll a map without using a tube on the inside or the outside."
2,Map arrived with creases (July 2009),I read the reviews and thought that with all of the comments Amazon would have improved shipping of this map... but NO they HAVE NOT! My map arrived in a triangular package with multiple creases as others have mentioned (July 2009). Based on other comments I likely won't return it just to wait for another creased map.... but SHAME ON YOU Amazon! Usually I'm so pleased with your service. This is a disappointment.
1,Packing issues continue,"As others reporting, map arrived with a dozen creases. Map was not shipped in a hard tube, just rolled up and packed in soft card, then folded flat. Sort it out Amazon!"
2,"Decent map, awful shipping","The map itself is fine, especially given the price. The ""lamination"" is a thin, waxy coating that hardly qualifies. But no matter.Main problem: the map is delivered in a flimsy, plain plastic bag--not even a sheath or pliable paper tube. The map was badly creased and dented on delivery, so it went back promptly. The shipping oversight here baffles me, and the UPS guys who picked the map up for return looked at me incredulously when I tried to convince them that it was indeed the original packaging."
1,terribly disappointed,This map came all smashed. It says it it laminated but it doesn't seem at all laminated. It is flimsy and not worth the money. I wouldn't recommend this map to anyone. I wanted it laminated so it would be durrible to use with kids but it is not that. The biggest problem is that it is smashed.
3,poor packaging,"the map is nice, but the packaging was terrible and left it with many creases in it that i can't get out.it's decent but not something i would frame in this condition. good for educational purposes i guess...if they fix the packaging problem, i would give it 4 stars."
3,Map is good but packaging was very bad,"The map is good, cheap, but the packaging that came with was crushed and mademany permanent creases in the map."
1,Feels cheap looks cheap,"I don't know why Amazon can't put the actual and true size of this map on the site. Is it really THAT HARD? I couldn't figure out what the size of this thing was and the 31.5"" size indication with other ridiculous numbers is the height - so beware this thing is BIG. approx. 60"" wide and 32"" tall. Besides the size problem the map looks faintly printed and feels really cheap in general. It's not what I would call ""laminated"" more like ""coated with a nano layer of plastic"". Also, the slightest accidental bending while handling this huge map will likely leave a permanent crease or wrinkle in the map. Returned!"
1,Still waiting to receive this item,"I placed my order for the world wall map deluxe on July 11th with an estimated delivery date of July 16th. I have been tracking my package through UPS and it consistently has a status of ""in transit"". UPS tracking says they received the package July 14th in Lewisberry, PA. I know I am horrible with geography, which is why I am purchasing this world map, but I do know that PA borders NJ, but did not realize it takes a month and still counting to get there."
1,The package was lost,The people at the post office are still trying to find my package. They were suppose to call me but they havent. I havent received it so I cant review the item itself.
1,Misleading Map,This map identifies Taiwan is a country with a legitimate capital. It's misleading and useless. I need to return it.
5,Perfect Condition!,"When I read some reviews, I was worried that my map would arrive all bent. But when we got it, it was in a long box and had packaging in it. Make sure you read the dimensions, though! It was a little bigger than I had imagined. It also came with two things to hold it up on the wall. Excellent!"
5,Awesome Map,This map is very bright and easy to read. It's also very sturdy construction. I would definately recommend it to friends and educators.
1,"No es lo que ofrecen la mercancia que envian no es la que promocionan, decepcionada","No es lo que ofrecen la mercancia que envian no es la que promocionan, decepcionada. El material de mala calidad."
4,Huge,Nice quality but looks so big (high on the body).It doesn t sit as tight as I thought it would be.
5,Cotton Comfort,"When it comes to underwear, I only want cotton briefs. But most don't fit well. The ""Bali Full-Cut Fit Stretch Cotton Briefs"" have a touch of spandex that gives a really comfortable fit. Plus, they don't ride up!"
3,Poor quality elastic waistband,"I love the fabric, and these are long enough in the rise, but the elastic at the waist is starting to deteriorate after just a few washings."
2,Color is off,"The description of the color is soft taupe. When they arrived they are more yellow than taupe. I wanted taupe to wear under white slacks so they won't show. These will definitely show. I won't be able to wear them under white slacks, so I'm sending them back. They also seem very cheaply made and the material is rough and scratchy. Not a good product at all, especially for the price."
3,Why change a winner?,"Nature's Gate Herbal Daily Shampoo is a product we have been using for several years, refilling our pump bottle from the large gallon size as needed. For some reason, without changing the name, Nature's Gate has changed the product significantly, and not for the better. Previously, the product was a yellowish, clear gel that poured easily, lathered easily and had a light, delicate fragrance. The product is now MUCH thicker, making it difficult to pour from the gallon bottle to a pump bottle, and is now opaque off-white, which is less of a concern, but it is not as esthetically pleasing as it was before (in fact, several years ago, this product was a beautiful 'aloe' green, and the company elected to change the color to a rather uninteresting yellow, but that's old news).This was a great product before its current incarnation -- not so much now. I don't think I will purchase it again."
3,"good shampoo, good value","This is my favorite vegetarian cruelty free shampoo. I was happy to find it in the gallon jug to save on both plastic and money. Based on what I had been paying, I figured it's like getting one out of every 6 normal sized bottles for free. The shipping was on time and well packaged."
5,As Ordered,"Package came in reasonably time, bubble-wrapped so it wouldn't get punctured , no problems, no leaking. I would order from this vendor again."
4,Holley throttle bracket works well,I needed a throttle cable mount that actually held the cable at the correct position to clear the air cleaner and allow the carb to be pulled fully open with my gas pedal. This part did this and it matched the carb base for fit. I do wish the cable hole was tighter so it held the cable better.
4,Good read - story line getting a bit old,"I enjoyed this book - a sequel to ""With Hostile Intent"" and ""Acts of Vengeance"" (I did not read ""Black Star""). It gets off to a slow start but has the usual action sequences that are detailed and riveting. Gandt does a good job recapping material from earlier book without becoming bogged down - especially helpful if you have not read the books in order. The lead characters are well presented without excess bluster or deep emotional sequences - although the latter is certainly not missing. Plenty of military detail adds to the realism. The The series is getting a bit tired but really a great read overall."
4,Finally announced for Region 1.,"I saw this version of The Day Of The Triffids on A&E; 17 years ago and have been looking for it since dvd became popular. I always loved the novel, and this version by the BBC follows it closely. It is not perfect, but is still much better than the silly Howard Keel version. No giant slurping trees here.I noticed on 2 reliable dvd sites that the BBC version is scheduled for a Region 1 release on November 6, 2007.The mini series gets 4 stars from me. Hopefully the dvd will justify that rating."
4,Needs more stuff,"This version is far superior to the 1962 version. The scenes in which the triffids first reveal themselves is chilling. The long length gives the viewer a chance to really understand what John Wyndham had in mind when he wrote the book.My only problem with this DVD is there are no extras. DVD's were practically made for pouring on the extras. This one, however, has nothing, which is a real dissapointment."
4,great production of classic novel,"Excellent presentation of how quickly civilization breaks down in the face of massive calamity. Eerie music and well-filmed scenes that stay with me, beginning early on with roaming bands of thugs preying on helpless people. Realistic view of the choices to be made when all we know collapses."
4,British Remake of the day of the Triffids.,I enjoyed this movie and was glad when it became available in DVD series one format. I read the book as a teen and of course saw the first version years ago. A departure form the first movie without the added story lines of the rewritten screenplay. I recommend this for Science Fiction fans.
1,Trite Triffids,"Oy! Being a Triffid fan, I was anxious to see this British version of a GREAT story.It's good, if you want a laugh. Everything is done ""On The Cheap"".The acting; poor. Music; awful. Creatures; dumb. Editing; disjointed.Everything reminds me of a poorly done public school production.My wife left the room before the second episode.I reluctanly stayed, did some fast fowarding, and eventually finished the production. Oy!!Stick with the original book (and it's sequel). What else can I say?!?!?!"
2,Good production,I like the original novel. The story is better than US movie. But this was made 30 years ago. Sorry it is old.
2,It's just ok,Normally I like British TV but this show was lacking something. It was worth watching only for the hilarious triffids. It's amusing enough for 2 stars. Long triffid tongues are scary. Watchthe 60's version for a good laugh.
4,FINALLY IT'S HERE,"THIS [THE ORIGINAL BBC VERSION] IS FAITHFUL TO JOHN WYNDHAMS BOOK. I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR OVER 20 YEARS TO GET A PROFESSIONAL COPY OF IT. WHEN I FIRST SAW IT IN 1985, I MADE A VHS COPY WHICH I WORE OUT IN 10 YEARS! I WISH THAT THEY HAD REMASTERED THE SOUND [DOLBY DIGITAL] AS WELL AS THE PICTURE. IT'S APPROACH [LIKE MOST MOVIES FROM THE UK] IS RELATIVELY LOW KEY [IT'S NOT A SHOOT EM UP!]. IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS PRESENTATION BEFORE, GET IT FOR YOUR LIBRARY. IT'S HEAD & SHOULDERS ABOVE THE 1962 MOVIE BEARING THE SAME NAME. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"
2,Worse than the original movie....,"I waited sooo long for this movie, just to be dissapointed. What we havehere is not a movie...its like a teleplay shot on video, lousy music(mostly a piano score)... long long boring scenes dweeling into the humanmind instead. Yes the British are good at this kind of stuff. Im not saying that its bad..im just saying that it kills the movie momentum.The movie is about killer plants...well in this film, we see one here andone there....with today's special effects they could have done much better. Some will welcome this new movie, but some like me will requestthe movie makers to make a true remake of this movie or dont bother at all. Im also ticked off at the precious time ive lost looking at thissoap opera... Gime the original movie anytime..at least its fun."
1,Waste of time,"As the British would say ""a crashing bore."" Long, monotonous, and the acting stinks especially the lead actress. Not the last bit scary and plants are idiotic. The original was much better.Save your money."
4,I like it!!!,"I like the pizza stone, I use it in my oven and on the bbq!!! it works great and the pizza cutter it came with works good also..."
2,Worked for a while,Broke before a dozen uses. Do not cook dessert with sugar on it. Sugar hardens and breaks. Stone easily stains and cannot be cleaned.
1,Broken- 3 in a row,"My first stone broke after about 10 uses - at 450, the second stone broke after its second use at 500 and my third stone broke in its first use at 550."
2,Breaks at high heat,"I've had this stone for a few years and it has worked great at temperatures below 450 degrees. It discolores but that was no big deal to me, maybe that is normal for pizza stones. Today I made a new kindof home made pizza which required the stone to be heated to 550 degrees. My pizza turned out great but when I took the stone out of the oven it had broken in half (though the halves were still attached to each other)! Conclusion is that if you make the store bought pizza which only needs to be heated at 350 degrees, this would be fine but for anything higher than 400 degrees I would not recommend it."
5,Stone,Just as great as pampered chef and a fraction of the price! Love the way it cooks everything to perfection!
2,Broke two of these before switching,"The first one I bought lasted three baking sessions, and it seemed to work well enough before it broke while cooking a pizza. A bit of olive oil had dribbled onto the stone over each of the cooking sessions, so I figured perhaps I was being sloppy and bought another. This time, I was very careful to build up a high crust on the dough to contain the melted cheese, sauce, and oil, and it broke again during my first cooking session, on the fourth pie. I've heard cast iron ones work almost as well, one guy I spoke with swears by a terra cotta disc he got at a gardening store. In any case, I won't be buying another one of these."
5,Great!,"Great product - works well, easy to use, helpful instructions, and accompanying tools are great.I wish the stone were a little larger, but I am pleased."
1,Arrived in four pieces!,Pretty upset for some odd reason this review has been blocked multiple times...the stone arrived totally useless in 4 pieces! I am unable to contact the seller and find it to be total bs! I want either my money back or a free replacement! End of Story! I recommend never buying from this seller!!!!
1,china guide,The most important pages of this book had been cut out. I will never buy another book from this company.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. I think it looks cheap and the magnification side is distorted. Should have ordered a mirror with a light. Tried using it a couple of times, now it just collects dust!Could have got a better deal and nicer mirror at Bed Bath & Beyond!"
4,No More -- No Less,"This count up/down timer is exactly what I was looking for. No bells, no whistles -- just timings up and down. It's small and light, and can be clipped or held. It even has a magnet for attaching to metal surfaces. I only wish it had a shut-off switch so that it doesn't start counting (and beeping) if it's accidentally brushed."
3,"Good, but talkative","It is a good product. It just makes a beep every time a button is pressed. For instance, when entering the amount of time, it beeps with each number entered."
3,OUT OF STOCK,"Use CAUTION before ordering from Electronica Direct: Although the website would suggest this item is in stock, I was highly disappointed when I ordered a case, extra battery, additional memory, etc. only to find that the most crucial portion of the shipment had been cancelled, days after I had placed the order. THE PHONE WAS NOT IN STOCK!"
5,incredible¡¡,It is the best phone I had a part of the treo 680. It has very good function and is quite fast. Very good ¡¡¡
5,GREAT ALL IN ONE DEVICE,"I love this. Phone works great with Tmobile Prepaid. I use it to sync Outlook and Word between home and office. It's a great note taker. For extensive notes, it works well with Bluetooth keyboard. One thing they don't tell you. In the charging cradle, it does slide show of photos with time and date. So it's a photo picture frame on your desk. GPS rocks. And it's got a voice recorder. Bluetooth works with car kit. Adequate camera. It's smaller than past Ipaqs but the screen is still visible. Love it."
4,"Very nice, but buggy device","This product is really neat - has everything I would want in a single, yet small device.My only complaint so far is that the phone sometimes simply freezes, and the only solution I have found is to remove the battery and consequently restart the device.The only SW I have installed so far is the beta version of Skype, which is really awsome!! I can call my relatives FOR FREE in the UK drinking a Capuccino at Starbucks using their free wi-fi access."
4,Bueno como Agenda.....pero peor que un teléfono,"Al parecer, uno no le puede pedir a un tostador de pan que lave tu ropa.Esto se cumple en la HP6945.Como agenda es excelente!Pero commo telefono todavía le falta. Es más difícil usarlo que un el modelo basico de Nokia.Además la cámara de 1.3 deja mucho que desear.De igual manera estoy satisfecho con la compra; envío y recibo mail con facilidad y además ando con 1 aparato envez de 3."
4,"HP 6945 Excellent, but slow",It is everything you need on a phone-PDA. It is light and the functionality is easy and better designed than the earlier versions.The only thing that I could say negative to the 6945 is that sometime is slow on heavy usage.
3,A little more realistic than Gilligan's Island,is Dusty's Trail. Situations here are slightly more believable. The non-Bob Denver actors are all about as good as the GI cast (though Ivor Francis as rich Mr. Brookhaven is a little inferior to Jim Backus as Mr. Howell). This is one of Denver's better post-GI efforts as he shines very well as Dusty. I just bought this on DVD having seen four DT series eps strung together on VHS minus the laugh track (which was put back on this DVD version). I love DT.
2,GILLIGAN'S ISLAND IN THE WILD WEST,"Ummm...for this to be labled as a ""classic TV"" show may be a bit of a stretch. Now I'm operating on memory here as this show goes back some 30 years or so to the mid 1970's.Basically the show is Gilligan's Island in the west. Except rather than being marooned on an Island, it's the story of a carriage lost in the west journeying from town to town.Bob Denver reprises his Gilligan role, this time as Dusty one of the inept carriage drivers who constantly bungles everything. Forrest Tucker basically plays the Alan Hale Jr. role as the other driver and boss who is always yelling and blaming Gilligan...err...Dusty for everything.The passengers of the wagon match..almost exactly those found on Gilligan with the rich person, the starlet, the country girl, etc...I mean I guess for the price it's not a bad deal but you really...REALLY have to be a huge fan I would say..."
2,For hardcore Bob Denver fans only,"I remember seeing a few episodes of this when I was nine years old --- I thought it was stupid even then. I would imagine that the core demographic for this type of show would be your younger set, so if a nine-year-old found it to be stupid, it is not surprising that the show quickly sank like a rock.Few shows were as totally derivative as this one. Everything was so obviously an attempt to duplicate ""Gilligan's Island"" --- with a little ""F Troop"" thrown in, perhaps --- that every viewer with any sort of memory would realize that it has all been done before. Even Gilligan fans found this to be stupid.I can't imagine that anybody but the most hardcore of Bob Denver fans would feel the need to acquire this. The only good thing one can say about this is that it is cheap, but I am amazed that anybody saw fit to release this on DVD. Good grief."
4,Germany & Austria At A Glance,"I think Rick Steves did a good job at presenting the highlights of Austria and Germany. It was easy to fast forward through parts of the video that did not pertain to our travels. Although I won't be traveling to most of the places on the video, it did give me a good feel for the German and Austrian culture. I especially liked the coverage on Saltburg."
2,did not like,could not finish watching the movie. did not like it at all. just not my style of movie I guess
3,Ho - Hum,"Seen the plot a thousand times, done with a religious tint to it. I think it would be OK for children, yes I could recommend it as a family night movie. Below age ten won't be able to follow it though. Can't remember any bad language or any seen to bad for children."
1,DONT BUY THIS..........,"Do not buy this DVD. I was so disappointed when I tried to watch it. The quality was terrible. The colors are dark and all messed up. I've seen these same cartoons on Cartoon Network before and they were perfet. I don't know why anyone would put these cartoons on here in this awful condition. Don't buy this, you will be very very disappointed. I wanted to just throw the DVD away. It looks bootleg. The cartoon titles are often cut off at the top and bottom of the screen. It looks just like somebody was videotaping these with a camcorder while thery were playing on a screen in front of them. It's all shaky. DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!! (However volume 2 is good)"
1,The quality is not very good,I would recommend Timeless Cartoons (asin number B0006I686G). Looneytunes Golden Collection or Classic cartoons.
4,History,"I bought this to watch Stingray. Low budget movie, but a classic! The dub quality was so so - kind of a bummer - but still watchable."
1,Poor information,"The information presented was very low budget, and not very convincing. 2003 has just about come and gone, nothing stated by Mark Hazelwood is correct in the video."
2,Thank goodness it was a Netflick...,"Helicopter pilot Colt Erickson (Adrian Pasdar of ""Heroes"") nearly has all his ducks in a row. About to propose to his longtime girlfriend (Kelly Rutherford of ""Melrose Place"" fame), and nearly in the black with his business due to various assignments stunt flying for movies, he's ready to settle down. He thinks he's going on a routine charter flight until a woman (Alicia Coppola) puts a gun to his head and forces him to assist in a prison break. Due to his former juvenile record and past association with the escapee (Antonio Sabato, Jr.), Colt is thought to be an accomplice, and has to use his stunt flying skills to pilot them to safety, while also trying to elude his captors.Cheesy dialogue and improbable situations are abundant in this underwhelming thriller filled with plenty of too stupid to live moments and considering the protagonist is a stunt pilot, it is pretty light on the stunts. And Pasdar has the perfect voice for silent movies."
1,my review,"This is a three dvd set. The production values can best be summarized as ""What values?""; the focus of the film as ""out of focus""; and the acting and choreography as very bad. Basically, it is a propaganda film that fails to deliver.I watched the first and second films, and never viewed the third.the last pretty much sums up my view: i didn't view it.tlt"
1,Don't buy this compilation......,"These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu.However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this )Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way."
3,"Nice action, less wire work would be nice.",I love the actual real martial arts displayed by Jet Li and others including Donnie Yen in this 3pack. I am not a big fan of the extensive wire use. They make the movies less realistic. Its an enjoyable 3pack if you are a Jet li fan.
4,Be careful unless you speak Chinese,Great action flick except this particular DVD is only in Chinese with English subtitles. Great for the purest in the crowd but killer for those of us who like badly dubbed English dialogue. Better off buying the single disc if you need English.
2,over-rated,"the first movie is very good but the second and third put me to sleep. Everyone said these movies were so great. I just can't see why. Unless you need to collect every Jet Li movie I would pass on this set. I think the first movie is worth buying singly though. It is very complex and unique. It will put you in a different dimension while watching it. But the 2nd and 3rd are so boring that I couldn't stay awake no matter how hard I tried. If you don't buy this set you will be missing nothing. However, try to pick up the first movie, it is very decent."
5,Once upon a time review,This is a classic starring Jet Li at the early part of his career. It was a bonus to add all three volumes at once.
4,Definitely a classic! A great collection to have!,"This is almost like Indiana Jones, but the Chinese version. Lots of adventures, with funny bits thrown in as well.The first 2 is the best (my favourite is the 2nd one with Donnie Yen) but I bought all 3 to keep, as it is hard to find them in local stores anymore. The only thing I liked about part 3 is the introduction of ClubFoot - one of the newest student of Wong Fei Hong. His style of fighting, with his 'demon feet' as his strength, is really captivating.The triology have audio in Mandarin and Cantonese, which is hard to fine. The English subtitles are pretty good - so I can watch with all my non-Chinese buddies. Picture quality is quite good, sound quality is ok (minus 1 star) - on some parts it looks as if the words are coming out before the mouth moves, but this is not a big glitch. Overall, I am very satsified having bought this trilogy collection.Buy this if you want a Chinese classic kung fu collection to enjoy for many many times."
4,SOLID DEBUT!,"A fine first novel from Larry Jones! Forget about the overly critical review from ""Publisher's Weekly""...this is a good read. I thoroughly enjoyed the diversity of the characters and the overall plot of the story. The author also did a solid job of smoothly weaving the Christian faith into the story. The epilogue, especially, really hit home for me. Congratulations on releasing your first novel, Mr. Jones!"
1,Crappy homemade Rip OFF!,"Not even a cleaver parody, this is a total Rip-Off of Cheech and Chong albums. Just check out the real thing instead of this unfunny rip off of bad imitations. Cheech Martin and Tommy Chong should sue these guys! Remember, they are back together in business you know!"
1,Piece of Junk--Don't Buy It!,This is a piece of junk. The cordless phone did not work from day one. The corded phone only worked intermittently. Often I could not get a dial tone unless I hit the phone!
2,Works fine for awhile,"I bought this exact phone two years ago. It worked fine until the handset died. Bought a new battery and it worked fine for about a week. Then the base died. No way could I revive it. But until then, it worked so well that I replaced it with the same model. I searched the internet and couldn't find a phone with all the features for a comparable price. I decided that for the price, two years was an acceptable lifetime."
5,LOVE IT!!!,"WOW! It's been forever since I last watched this show. Nowadays, Nickelodean rarely ever plays the old nicktoons. I remember watching this when I was really young. So nostalgic!!!"
2,only 7 episodes?? why are alot of Episodes missing??!,"BEFORE YOU MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THE EPISODES, READ THIS. For some strange reason, alot of episodes are missing. there were suppose to be 21 episodes in the first season. Go to wikipedia and you will see that there are suppose to be more episodes then what the amazon instant streaming is offering. If you want to see all the episodes, then you have no choice but to get the DVDs. This is just a friendly warning so that people dont make the mistake of wasting money just for a few episodes. Save it for the DVD. This is just stupid for them to put only a few episodes and not even warn the customer. Its as if they dont care much about this show. Good thing i checked wikipedia."
4,Perfect gift,I bought this for my brother for Christmas. it was exactly what i ordered. It came fast and brand new like the discription said. i would buy from this seller again
3,NOT COMPLETE!,"This show is great. Unfortunately, the dvd producers didn't care. They included 20/21 of the season 1 episodes. It is important to note that this release is missing the pilot episode. I did not realize this and I am semi-disappointed."
3,animal armageddon,was ok i expected more animation and less talk from the profs.probably would not have bought it if i'd known this.
5,The Best of the Best,"I'm sorry to see that this book is out of print; I have read through my copy so many times that is is falling apart. Oswald Chambers had such a wise spirit for a young man. The Chambers devotions at the beginnig of each daily reading of the Bible come from many of his speeches, all of which were written down by his wife; otherwise we would not have the wisdom of his words today. Chambers gets to the nub of spiritual life, and many of his words inspired by God are what I call ""ouchies."" In otherwords his arrows take the Word of God straight to what your weakness is. I would recommend this devotional Bible to anyone who seeks to deepen his/her spiritual walk, even though I don't always agree with his theology. Just Read It! God's Holy Word + Oswald Chambers = Uplifting"
3,"Tastes great, but nutritional information is WRONG!","Just received mine today. The Peanut Butter Fudge variety. Very tasty. Much to my chagrin though, the nutritional information provided with the link here couldn't be more incorrect.Here is the actual information, straight from the package sitting in front of me:Calories - 200Calories from Fat - 105Total Fat - 12g (18% DV)Saturated Fat - 5G (25%!)Trans Fat - 0%Cholesterol - 0%Sodium - 100mgPotassium - 125mgTotal Carb - 10gDietary FIber - 1gSugars - 5gProtein 13gDo with it what you will, but this will be my only box. Too much fat content for what I'm trying to do. Oh well, back the dotFit bars I guess..."
1,dubbed dialogue,"Was disappointed that all three films were dubbed in English instead of having subtitles. I feel it's more authentic if you hear the actual voices of the actors. Further, the dubbing was terrible, reminded me of those cheaply made kung-fu movies of the 70's where the actors mouthing of the words are not in sync with what they are supposed to be saying."
3,The three burials,"This was a wierd movie, a little slow to start, but the story was different. Tommy Lee Jones did a great job with the part, but the movie drifted for periods of time that didn't make sense."
4,border patrol blues,"I liked this movie even more than I thought I would. I am a Tommy Lee Jones fan and I usually enjoy all his movies BUT this one was definitely different in a great way. What a creative story line and an eye opener to the Border Patrol. Yes, I believed it! Dark Humor abounds. Don't find out what it is about, just go watch and be nicely surprised."
3,The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,"Although this was an interesting story I could never figure out where there were three burials. I only saw two.This is well acted by both American and Mexican actors. Barry Peppers plays Mike Norton, a bored border patrolman who appreciates no one, mistakenly shoots and kills Estrada but then doesn't tell anyone. Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete Perkins, Estrada's friend, who fulfills Estrada's death wish of being buried in his hometown in Mexico. When he finds out Norton killed him he forces Norton to dig up Estrada's body and carry the rotting corpses across the Rio Grande. A dark comedy, you will find yourself chuckling at both Perkins and Norton and even at the corpses."
5,A hidden gem,"Watched a portion of this movie on cable, and immediately sought out the DVD for purchase. I am not one to buy DVDs these days, especially with the efficiency in time and money of renting them, however with this movie I made the exception."
2,Tommy Lee Jones is a great actor but the movie lacks,"This movie was probably made because the US border patrol was a popular subject at the time of making this movie. However it is too esoteric to make any point. Too morose to make any connection with the audience. Too disjointed of have any continuity of thought. The cinematography may work if one was blood thirsty.If you want to see Tommy Lee Jones in a good movie try ""The Fugitive"" (1993). Or if you really like campy then try ""Volcano"" (1997).The FugitiveVolcano"
2,Too graphic for my taste!,The movie present several very graphic scenes of a dead body decomposing. It was gross! The plot was not interesting either... Not watching it again!
3,If okay you want to take a nap during a movie,"A real snoozer for me. Came recommended by a good friend. Our friendship remains intact, but I wouldn't ""pay it forward"" as they say."
4,The Three Burials...,"I caught this on Cable very late one night. I must admit, this was avery good film. Tommy Lee Jones yet again delivers another greatperformance. I'm so used to him being ""over the top"" that it was a shockto see him with such an understated performance. He was still the heroin this film, but he was just so...low key as to be almost invisible.A great peformance by Tommy.Four stars for the Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada!"
2,Disgusting,"The movie has several long, disgusting, close up shots of a decomposing body and of a gangrenous foot. These gruesome shots become more and more prominent as the story line disintegrates into nonsense and banalities."
1,Just my opinion,"After reading all the reviews, I ordered this movie and I can not tell you how disappointed I was! There was not one thing I enjoyed about this movie. I thought it was depressing from the beginning and never got any better. The acting was good, but as for the movie, I would give it 0 stars!! Don't waste your money on this one. Buy Man of the House. It is great!BTC"
3,weary of this social agenda,"Cuckolded, kidnapped, handcuffed, lassoed and dragged by a horse, beaten and kicked in the presence of his young wife, bitten by a poisonous snake and refused standard medical care, scalding hot coffee poured on an open wound, nose deliberately broken, terrorized and finally forced to bow and pray to a dead adulterer ....and the victim is, of course, a white heterosexual male. Once again Hollywood reminds us the only group which it is politically correct to bash is the white straight man. If all this abuse were inflicted upon a minority in any movie the public would be up in arms. However, once the viewer gets beyond the obvious and simplistic social agenda, this flick has entertainment value. The background music of blues and country western is excellent. The script is interesting and the plot is pleasant to follow. The actors are easy on the eyes and a few colorful characters are a bonus. Dull scenery and the absence of any comic relief lower its value."
3,"Interesting, but.......","I bought this because I am a Tommy Lee Jones fan. It was worth what I paid for it, kept me wondering what was going to happen, but glad I bought it used. Tommy Lee Jones was as good as always, but the story line was weak."
4,DIFFERENT YET VERY VERY GOOD!!!,"Hello Everyone!!! Ok, Tommy lee Jones, Barry Pepper... play very well off each other... It was a well bt together movie.. I gave this movie 4 out of five stars..I must add this movie can be slow at times.. however it worth wathing.ThanksIts your Review from the Jay Guy"
3,Mediocre. I wouldn't bother to watch it again.,"I watched this film because I heard many good critics, but it proved to be a disappointment. Tommy Lee Jones shows some nice directing tricks in some scenes but the overall result is mediocre and the finale awfully simple and predictable. The director, though, clearly has the potential for something better. May be next time."
1,Bad people + bad sex = bad taste,"If you are interested in movie that presents a one dimensional view that all Border Patrol agents and all Texans are amoral, white trash, you may like this movie. In my personal experience, that view is extremely predjucial. One the other hand all the Mexican characters were presented as humble, helpful, saints -- which is a little closer to reality in my experience. Other reviews mention the theme of redemption. Yeah, you can find it if you look hard, but about 75% of the movie was devoted to showing just how badly the gringos need redemption.Frankly, between the distorted view of Texans & Mexicans, the ugly sex, and bad language we did not enjoy this movie. If you are interested in more balanced view of the individual, rough, tough, righteous cowboy, with a great theme of redemption, stay away from The Three Burials and watch Open Range, perhaps the best of the Western genre in the past 15 years."
4,The Fairy Faith,A good insight into fairy legends and those who claim to have seen them.Documentry style dvd.
5,"Beautiful, enjoyable documentary","A rare and enjoyable documentary examining the belief in fairies from a diverse group of individuals and locations. On top of the enjoyable interviews, the scenery filmed was so beautiful and well done it is a worth watching for that reason alone."
5,Enchanted,"Using the narrative of his own curiosity and search for truth, the writter/director unfolds a beautiful story of some of the recent mythology of the faerie realm. Interviews offer varied views of the light and dark side of faeries, as well as the intellectual perspective and personal experiences. Fun and informative!"
3,"Not enough Froud, too many people hard to understand","I bought this for the Brian Froud interview which was way too short! I enjoyed that one bit so much, and some of the others said great things too, the harpist was lovely. Some of the regular people telling stories were difficult to understand sometimes because of their accents, perhaps subtitles would have helped some. It is not as much of a documentary as I expected, just one interview following the other, I don't think we see the filmmaker at all. This would be amazing with some narration in between each speaker. At times I was bored with the rambling."
2,Sounded Good; not worth it,"I purchased this along with ""Fairy Tale-A True Story"" assuming it would give a little more insight into the ""Fairy"" genre. The truth of it is that ""The Fairy Faith"" goes on-and-on with repetitous stories and anecdotes to the point where I pulled the disc at halfway point and have felt no desire to finish. If does have any redeeming value past this point, it would have been wise to give the viewer SOME hope. I find the subject matter very intrigueing and the ""Fairy Tale"" film was delightful and beautifully done, but this documentary is neither."
3,Not so fast....,"The picture was ok, nothing special, but the way it was packaged, well let's just say that they must not think too much of their own product. There was almost adequate packaging material in the box to protect the picture but unfortunately it was all on the back side of the picture so that it arrived with the picture frame dented and beat up. I will not be purchasing anything from them again!"
2,Not what picture depicts,Purchased this item and disappointed with frame. Returned it once and second frame was chipped but not as noticeble. There is no gold lable depicted in picture just a cut out on white paper. So picture is misrepresented in order picture. I do not think this picture is worth 99$ Is also plastic glass material as well. The print itself is enjoyable and detailed and only reason i kept it tired of shipping back and forth hoping to get a mint condition frame. I hope I get a discount but buyers should consider this before purchase.
5,Dazzling & delightful!,"I had no idea until last week that there was a book to accompany Ken Nordine's classic album ""Colors!"" Of course I ordered a copy immediately ... and I'm not disappointed in the least. As the previous reviewer says, the illustrations are a refreshing change from the trite, predictable work found in too many children's books. They match the words for imagination & dizzy, free-wheeling fun! I wouldn't hesitate to give both this book & the ""Colors"" CD to a child, but I'm just as happy to own both as an adult. And I'd love to see more children's books from this team! Highly recommended!"
2,"Story: 5 stars, art: 0 stars, overall average: 2 stars","I certainly hope Mr. Nordine wasn't the person responsible for picking and approving what this artist did. I loved the Colors CD and had to get the book to go with it. I would have been better off transcribing the work on the CDs than buying the book.Frankly, I have to wonder what the artist was on when he drew this, then I wonder what the Editor was on when he _approved_ the art. I'm sorry, but I feel like I could do the drawings in my sleep. Had I seen sample pages, I would not have bought the book.The pictures do not complement the words - they detract from them. If I were to read this aloud to children, I would be totally lost trying to follow the words on the pages.My recommendation: But the CD, skip the book."
3,Engaging but full of too many holes.,"A very interesting view of how a single moment in time can lead to so many profoundly different histories. This one centers on Columbus' voyage to the west, and raises questions of what may have happened if he didn't travel west. Our current world evolves into a rather dire future for humanity, so the people from our timeline (set in the future) try to set things straight.They want to prevent the enslavement of the native people of North Amerca, and have history unfold quite differently. However, the alternate history that Card builds in the last quarter of the novel is really not plausible in my mind. It is far too didactic about how humans should live, rather than really probing why humans are they way they are.And the rosy ending at the end is nice for a movie, but not very interesting for a book."
2,Nice but deceiving.,"I clearly expected much better from the writer of the Ender series. Everyone here is just is just so nice and cold and impersonal...I mean, Colombus is a hero, alright, and all the scientists from the future are nice and want to better mankind but doesn't it lack some personnality, some drama? I admit there are good ideas and the writing is, as always, quite good, but the plot just lacks strength.Almost on of those read-and-forget books.I'll probably try Children of the mind anyway and hope that i'll be surprised and entertained more than in Pastwatch"
3,Why couldn't it have gotten good earlier?,"The last half of this book saved it from getting a 2-star rating. It wasn't until the end of the book that things started getting good. It was at that point that Card really dove into the possibilities of time travel and manipulation. The first half of the book, in my opinion, was a failed attempt to associate the reader with the characters and fell flat. Characters, love interests, motives were not really developed that well."
3,inventive and engrossing (though sometimes simplistic),"""Pastwatch"" by Orson Scott Card is an inventive re-imagining of the world if Christopher Columbus hadn't come to America and launched that whole sordid chapter of history. Narrated in turn by citizens of the future and Columbus himself, the book is meticulously researched with fascinating treatises on history, politics, geology, religion, mythology, and anthropology. As engrossing as that all is, the narrative fizzles somewhat in the last third of the book into a new age victory and love parade. Still, worth reading - it's quick and compelling."
2,Not my type of book,"I bought this book for my father (who loves OSC's works), and, after finishing it, he told me to read it. I shortly found that it was not my type of book. However, I could also quickly tell that this book could be loved by some people.Problem is, nothing happened. Boring to the extreme. I lasted to page 100..."
1,"""Pastwatch"" or is it ""Pastwash""","Pastwatch is a future organization that has the technology to view the past. What did Pastwatch see when they viewed the lives of Jesus and Muhammed? This book, whose entire premise seems to be religon and redemption fails to tell us. In Orson Cards future world, Christianiy is still around so when the Pastwatch organization viewed Jesus'life they must of seen he was God. Islam is still around, so when Muhammeds' life was viewed they must of seen that ""Allah was god, and that Muhammed was his Prophet."" I could not suspend my disbelief after 200 pages, the situation and the technology seemed forced, squeezed to fit into an implausible plot. The Columbus parts of the story are tedious, and dreadful, you hate when they appear, as they are filled with cardboard charicatures. The cover was interesting but buying a book under that pretext well ...you know."
2,eh,It was ok... nothing special... though Card does have a wierd facination with his male characters' wangs ( see: Treason) all very odd. At any rate if you are of the opinion that western society is evil you will probably love this book up until a sort of secular christianity wins out then you'll probably hate it. I did like Kemal though... he was pretty cool.
1,Gave up on it after 200 pages.,"This is my first (and probably only) Orson Scott Card novel, but I think he's bit off more than he can chew. To write about people who lived 500 years ago would take a lot of skill and knowledge--I was never convinced I was reading about Christopher Colombus (I think calling him ""Colon"" in the novel was Card's token effort for historical veracity) or Queen Isabella. But all of the characters, including the future scientists, are too transparently unidimensional, cardboard constructs who can be described in a sentence. This was simply too agonizing for me to get through."
1,"Please, Card, keep your sexual fantasies to yourself.","Why does Card always seem to have to include all his weird naked inappropriate moments in his books? Maybe to redeem himself from bad plots. I wished that I had not wasted my mind and time reading this book. I feel like my mind has been violated by this author. It's been a while since I read one of his books. Now I remember why.I listened to the whole book: Nothing works, unless you enjoy reading endless conversations that seem to stop time. While I was reading, I was banking on the idea that the final moral to the story would be something that I could use. I will just say that people do not become converted to Christianity simply by promising them gold and then wowing them with some magic tricks.Here is something that maybe I can use: Let me imagine that I have traveled from another time, and that I'm now living in the year 2009. What can I realistically do that can make the world a better place?"
2,This book is horrible!,-boring -unrealistic -boring -it doesn't get interesting until ur 3/4 of the way through and half of the info mantioned in the first part is useless.
5,Present Food Crisis in Likely Future Scenerio,"Orson Scott Card in his book Pastwatch conveys an interesting perspective on the present food crisis in the book's third quarter. It lends a particularly penetrating, relevant slant on people's obsession with gluttony and the effect of over-consumption on the food crisis of the future. Through revised techniques in agriculture, the human population has increased more than any time in history. Yet how long can the world support such increases in population when the world's most powerful countries continue treating food - and energy - with such frivolous disregard? This book is a wake-up call to consider options for conservation for whoever has ears to hear."
4,If you could change the past...,"The Premise: How different history would have been if only: 1) Columbus had just a bit more of a conscience, and/or 2) The native Americans had been just a bit more ready, technologically, to meet him, and/or 3) Columbus had been prevented from returning to Europe! Pastwatch, which exists in a future where all the earth is dying from pollution and environmental degradation, sends three messengers into the Past; one, to improve Columbus' conscience, one to prepare the native people and one to prevent the return. They hope at least one will get through, and succeed; all three do. The result is ""too good to be true."" As a time-travel novel, this book has its flaws; as a morality play, and a cool look at the complex nature of history (not to mention the complexities of human nature!) it is just about unequaled. Read it for the philosophy, not for the believability."
3,"Interesting premises, shaky execution","Pastwatch has good and bad things going for it, and I will attempt to summarize them without spoiling things for a potential reader.Con: While I love some of Card's novels, this one did not engage me in the same fashion, and while thought provoking, it just seemed slow and listless compared to some of his other books. The characters seemed not only distant and removed from each other, but from the readers. Romance, when it occurred, felt forced.Pros: As a sci-fi fan, I love tampering with the time stream. This is the first time I can recall wondering what happens if you *don't* tamper with it, and Card has some unexpected ideas on that front. I really enjoyed learning more about Columbus (no idea if it was at all accurate, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt), and the Mesoamerican civilizations were fascinating as well.On the whole, I enjoyed it, but I don't think I would encourage others to put it at the top of their book piles."
2,What's wrong with Card?,"I adore Orson Scott Card so I could not wait to get my hands on this book. But when I had wolfed it down I felt utterly cheated. The theme is enchanting enough; a team of brilliant scientists goes back in history to stop Christopher Columbus. However, he develops this team using an entire crew of boring, flat characters. Card is usually a mastermind when it comes to creating intriguing personalities; not so this time. They are all brilliant and (after a few pages) almost without emotion. The natives think the timetravellers are gods and that's exactly how they behave. Never a moment doubt or real interaction; just being enigmatic and busy saving the world. Please, Mr. Card, you can do better than this"
5,"OH MY GOSH, THIS IS FABULOUS","I think that I have read this book bout 18 times - yes, it's THAT good.And each time, I discover more wonderfulness.I can't begin to imagine the thought and research that went into this book, but Mr. Card, THANK YOU. This is a magnificent, thought-provoking book with incredible real characters."
4,Excellent book with a few flaws,"Orson Scott Card is a wonderful writer. He is one of the most compassionate writers I have ever read, especially in science fiction. His scenarios are always fascinating. However, the one thing that bugs me about him is his fast and loose use of ""futuristic technology"" in his books. Because he writes in the sci-fi genre, he imagines he can get away with any sort of nonsence, like a machine that lets you see any moment in the past, from any viewpoint. This seems impossible to me and nowhere in the book does he even attempt to explain how this could be. I usually read hard sci-fi, so I like plausible technology. Or at least an attempt at explaination. However, if you forgive this one issue, Pastwatch is an excellent book. Not as good as Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead, but better than most of the sci-fi drivel published these days."
2,Puh-lleeaasse,"I'm a fan of sci-fi, but that's what I said aloud most often when reading this story.I am struggling to express, even to myself, what I so disliked about this book. The writing was good, as you would expect from Card, although almost unbearably preachy. I guess it's the whole suspension of disbelief thing - the problem being that I just couldn't.Not even in my wildest liberal dreams could I believe the premise of the story: That if someone had just loved Christopher Columbus - we would be living in a politically correct, environmentally friendly utopia."
2,"Great writer, so-so book.","Orson Scott Card is certainly a great writer, but he falls way short here. The book starts off well enough letting us get to know a group of future historians who spend there time watching history on special machines that show them the actual events of the past. These historians believe that it is impossible for them to effect the past, but they learn that they are wrong. What follows is extremely contrived as Card suddenly decides that his ideal future is actually on the verge of a collapse so complete that society will never rise up again, and the people of the world VOTE to erase their very existance in hopes of creating a better world! Yikes! In spite of good writing and an excelent treatment of Columbus as a driven but basically good man, Card never manages to overcome his ridiculus set up. The scenes near the end are also very contrived as the characters transform to world of Columbus's day into a nearly perfect world with very little effort."
2,disappointed unexpectedly.,"I expected to read an excellent book... but... after 300+ pages of reading, I still felt like the book hadn't started yet. I would not recommend this book. The characters are ""flat"" and there is a LOT of confusing, esoteric discussion ... that doesn't give a fluid explanation for things in this book. Maybe I was let down because I had expected something entirely different, but I don't know. There just seems to be something MISSING in this novel. It just doesn't capture the reader the way it ought."
4,good read!,story captures your attention. He moves well between the future and the past. I would recommend to any sc fi fan
4,Card plays his hand differently,"As an Orson Scott Card fan I was pleasently surprised not to see another biography of a brilliant, world changing child (Ender series, Alvin Maker, Wyrms, etc). Card appears to be most enchanted with the idea of time travel as a force of good. Perhaps because of this, the characters of this book are not quite as compelling as his others. Nevertheless, it is still Orson Scott Card's work. His writing and storytelling abilites (even when not his best) are far better than the majority of current SF"
4,An Effort of Humanity and Technology to Provide an Ectopia!,"Card in his novel uses technology to find the roots of misery in humans' lives, using history and technology as to attempt to change them. Although the pastwatchers do not belong to any specific religion, they create the perfect world with people who have good intentions. This interesting part of this novel is that his ecotopia is not created by white, wealthy, pious human beings"
2,Not for the intensely practical,"Spoiler alert! Since my problem is with the plot, I may be giving twists away.I don't usually like alternate history, since the past is immutable. But Orson Scott Card thinks deeply about all he writes, and I was interested in his take on the Europeans' arrival in the Americas.Problem is, we get multiple alternate histories in Pastwatch. The brilliant scientists in the story have evidently never heard of the Law of Unintended Consequences.I willingly suspend disbelief for most novels. This one contains too many improbabilities for me and perhaps for the like-minded."
4,Sarah,"This is a wonderful and exciting view of the lives of Sarah and Abraham. I wasn't sure I would like it, but once I read one page, I was unable to put the book down. It is the best book I have read this year. This is the first book I have read by Orson Scott Card. I am looking foreward to reading the rest of The Women of Genesis."
5,Simple and Reliable,"This is a great, no-frills stopwatch. I use two of them in a Toastmasters club to keep track of speech times. Not having to worry about multiple laps, splits, and the other ""features"" that other stopwatches offer is really helpful. The simplified structure of this stopwatch allows us to quickly and accurately determine the times that we need."
5,Timer Review,"I am a USCG Auxiliary member and needed a stopwatch to use in Man Overboard search and rescue boat maneuvers. I was looking for a very simple timer that would give me start, stop, reset, functions, be of good quality, and be inexpensive. I didn't need all the many functions other stopwatches offered. The buttons are large and easy to use,and has nice large, clear numbers, easy to read.This stopwatch fits the bill. I am very happy with it and highly recommend it. If all you need is a simple stopwatch, this is the one."
5,Easy to Use Stopwatch,"If you are looking for a simple stopwatch, this is it. There are two buttons on it: ""stop/start"" and ""reset"". The numbers are huge, so if you are looking at the timer from far away, you will be able to see it easily.I use this in guided reading groups, and the nice thing about it is that the lanyard is long enough for it to sit in my lap,and the numbers are large enough that I can see it easily while I am teaching. If you are are teacher, you know that it is not useful to let kids keep track of timing when teaching because they will be so focused on when they are done that they can't concentrate. Therefore, this is a useful feature for someone like me.The only thing that disappointed me, and I should have known this but not being stopwatch savvy, I didn't, I thought that ""timer"" meant that it would have a timer that you could set and have beep. If you are looking for this feature, you should probably look elsewhere. Otherwise, great product!"
1,NOT WHAT I PAYED FOR,"The seller was nice and all but when I expressed that this item was not what I payed for she told me shed reimburse me for the item but on for the shipping, so either way I was screwed out of money. I was livid! The description of this item was completely deceiving, I wanted a silent (as in makes no sound) stop watch. Not only was the watch loud, it did not have a silent option or even an off/on button! SILENT OPERATION does not mean that it is silent even if the description says silent option. Now I'm stuck with a loud constantly ON stopwatch."
1,Broke within 2 days,I'm in graduate school and bought this stopwatch to collect data. I am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED with this product. When I attempted to use the stopwatch within 2 days of opening the package I found that it didn't work. This is the worst product I've ever purchased from Amazon. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Piece of Crap!,"I bought 2 of these watches within a week or so apart. They worked fine at first but within less than 2 months one watch had failed and then 2 weeks later the second watch failed. I tried to contact the seller and the seller responded that the 30 day warranty was up so....too bad. I have other watches I purchased at Walmart years ago and these watches still work. If I could give this NO stars I would. Stop watches just don't fail unless they are dropped crushed whatever, but the screens on these just display dashes. I was extremely disappointed with the poor customer service. I still had the plastic on the screen! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY! If you want to get rid of $20+ dollars quickly then donate it to where it will do some good."
1,Mis-leading Description,"I ordered this to get a stopwatch for my workouts - something simple. What I received is the equivalent to a kitchen egg timer. It has countdown only, and does not even resemble the item in the picture! If you are looking for a kitchen timer, this is it - if you want a stopwatch look for something else."
4,The Ultrak Simple Event Timer Stopwatch - Silent Operation Review,"Even though I only gave this stopwatch a 4 star rating, it is a solidly built, quality product and I would definitely recommend it. The silent operation is just that, silent, although you can hear a faint click from the button mechanism moving. The only reason I took a star away is because it is just a start/stop/reset stopwatch and does not include a clock or the LAP feature. This is probably stated right in the product information and I just overlooked it, which is fine because I don't really need the clock and wouldn't use the LAP feature anyway. I use this stopwatch for preparing speeches I give which requires a great deal of concentration, thus I did not want the annoying beep, beep, beep that you get with practically any other stopwatch. It is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for."
2,Meh,"""Mode"" button never worked.If I saw a different cumulative timer, I would have got it.Otherwise, it does seem to add up the seconds.So I use it for that."
5,"Great, simple stopwatch","Stop watches with multiple features are a liability in the flying environment. This watch features no tricks, no problems. Start the watch, stop the watch, clear the time. Great for my needs."
1,"Cartoon Marathon, Vol. 2","Don't waste your money on this DVD, the sound track is off by almost FIVE SECONDS - a total waste of your time (and money!) If I could give this disc a zero, I would!! One star!"
2,Not as good as some of the other ones,The quality is not as good as it should be. I would say buy the looney Tunes Golden Collection and classic cartoons (B00063QD6G). I am a cartoon fanatic and quality is very important too me. If the color is washed out or the sound is not as clear I can not enjoy the cartoon.
4,Highly Recommended,"The instruction on this DVD is outstanding. I have been practicing yoga for 10 years and am often frustrated by the poor quality of the instruction on many yoga DVDs (of which I have tried quite a few). This one is refreshingly different, however, in its quality. The setting/graphics are a bit dull (I like to pretend I'm not in my living room practicing when I'm in my living room practicing!) but otherwise this is a great yoga DVD. I especially like that the sections are clearly separated so you can do whatever you're in the mood for/have time for on that particular day, or go to the instructional sections for more information. Overall an excellent choice for a guided home yoga practice."
2,Not what I expected.,"When I bought this dvd I was expecting a challenging yoga workout with a very detailed anatomy of the human body in relation to yoga. The dvd did provide both of those, however, I was also looking for more of a single workout, rather then different segments on either standing poses, sitting poses, ect. When I do yoga I use it as a relaxation where it's just me and the mat. However, with the use of props in this video. It was too distracting to relax when you had to constantly change the fold of a blanket or listen to instructions for folding that blanket."
4,Great practice,"This is a wonderful DVD, however, I would say it's more for the beginner yogi (1-3 years of practice) I would highly recommend this dvd if your beginning students want to work on going deeper with their home practice. I would recommend checking out Tamara's Yoga FusionTAMARA'S YOGA FUSION"
3,Useful but nowhere near an advanced practice.,"I gave this dvd 3 stars because it is not for an intermediate or advanced participant. I do however, rate it 5 stars for an advanced beginner. There are 2 or 3 moves that will challenge you (adv. beginner). Intermediates will find it a little boring, but the chapter she spends explaining the spinal movements almost makes it worth the purchase. One last thing for beginners. DO NOT mimic her movements because her form is not always the best. DO listen to what she's saying though."
5,Great songs...great movie...,Excellent movie soundtrack with almost every song being radio and car friendly...two great remixes at the end...
3,somewhat outdated,"This book was written during the days of film. the exposure settings are somewhat confusing as each exposure is ""Pushed 1 stop"" a technique not necessary in the digital world. The equipment discussions are useable only in general terms as specific models have long since been replaced. There is a chapter on choosing film and ""new"" auto focus cameras. Post processing is understandably absent as the darkroom used in this era was really a darkroom.With all that, the other content is very good as the theory of digital photography is the same as the film days. There is helpful information on animal actions and behavior, composition, getting close and more.I can recommend this book, with reservations. It will help you in a number of ways, but not as much a more current book."
5,very good book,lovely book with excellent information. found it very useful along with the cd of part -2 . useful for starting out with bird photography
2,Out of Date Information,"This book points out such valuable information as: use a long lens (like the authors $9,000 glass,) and get close. Hey, I never would have thought of that! The book was written in 1997 and deals exclusively with 35mm film media. A large portion of the book is devoted to film types and uses, and exposure and development techniques. Virtually no one, including Authur Morris, uses film anymore. Additionally, the author makes many equipment recommendations for equipment that is no longer even produced. This might have been a valuable publication, when it was written, 10 years ago, but it is sadly out of date now."
2,OK but flawed,"This is a quite good but flawed ""how to"" book on bird photography with pretty good pictures. It is flawed for the following reasons: 1) It is not the complete guide to bird photography the undertitle claims it to be. Several important aspects of bird photography are not treated in any detail. 2) Technical advise is very brand specific. The book would have been better with general information on how equipment works like most other ""how to"" books, and not centered around a single camera model from a company the author is sponsored by. This book will date fast and is not the only one you need on the subject."
1,Horrible book...poor english skills,Art Morris should pay me to read this book. It is poorly written. The skills are outdated as well. Spend your money and time on a book by a real professional writer and photographer!
5,Great tanning lotion!,"I love this lotion! Smells great, leaves your skin super soft after you tan and it really increases your tanning ability! Also, got my order super fast. Would highly recommend this product! In fact I already have to friends and family! Also make sure you buy it on Amazon.com! You won't find it cheaper anywhere else!"
4,Excellent product but rubs off on your cloths,Spellbound is an excellent lotion. Dont let the only 4 bronzers fool you. They are stronger then some of the 20x 50x and 100x bronzer lotions. Color can been seen after just 1 visit. It is a silicon based lotion which means its not greasy. I am sensitive to skin breakouts and have had no problems with this lotion. Absorbtion is excellent. The smell is decent and you dont smell like a coconut when you come out of the tanning. There is no oranging of the cuticles and between your fingers. The color recieved from the lotion is a true brown and not orangy.The downside to this lotion is it does rub off on the towel and sadly your clothes. If you are hardcore and set on getting really dark as fast as possible then you should not take a shower for at least 8 hours for maximum bronzer absorbtion into the skin. You will get much darker much quicker this way.
2,Over rated!,"I used this lotion for 3 weeks with minimal results, I was starting to think I was one of those people that aren't able to obtain a tan in a tanning bed.... then I got worship me... and wow! results in 2 days! I couldn't believe I wasted my time, money, and skin on spellbound... I was sad to see it didn't work... I wish it would have. Well at least it smelt good."
1,Not worth it!,They lotion actually seemed to cause me to lose my tan. I dont know why? I usually use a tanning product with tingle so i dont know if it had anything to do with it. After purching this i used for about 2 weeks and was getting lighten instead of darker. I went to Sallys and purchased a bottle of lotion for $10 and it works great!
1,Whatever,"Yes ! I know many people is going to think that I shouldn't put one star if I didn't try this product but people should be aware that this seller sucks !, after one month and a half I didn't get my product at all ! even though I sent many e-mails, not even a ""umm... Sorry?"". Thank God Amazon policies are awesome and we can rely on them in case that a crappy seller like this guy does stuff like this."
5,frugal gourmet cooks with wine,"i already loved this book, this was a replacement for me my other was worn out, beautiful book! thank you"
5,Jeff Smith - Cooking with Wine,"All I can say is I'm glad I bought the book.I also taped many of his TV shows, and I've got another paperback containing his recipes of three different countries.He was an excellent chef, and died too young.Prices at Amazon are always low and reasonable.cbrad4334@aol.com"
3,Don't be fooled,"The Recess christmas ""movie"" is an enjoyable holiday treat, although...don't be fooled as I was when I got the video expecting to see an all-new christmas adventure with these great kids...most of the stories in this ""movie"" are old television episodes of the ""recess"" series already being shown on televison, bookended with the two teachers and the principal stuck in the snow at christmas time and told through flashbacks. Again, an enjoyable video but not entirely a ""christmas"" movie and hardly any of it is new."
4,Excellent Christmas story with James Earl Jones as Santa,"This is a fun Christmas tape for fans of Recess. I think the last story featuring James Earl Jones as Santa was quite touching and funny. At least one other reviewer, who said there was ""no Christmas content"" on the tape, must not have actually watched it. I guess technically some of the material comes from the episodes they have produced but unless your child has taped every episode this is unlikely to be redundant in your collection."
3,"""Recess"" is radical!","""Recess-School's Out"" was really pretty awesome, & although I never saw the Christmas version, I'll bet that it was also very charming, in a sense.-Earl"
5,Great buy.,Easy install. My PC was up and running in about 10-15 mts. No hassles. The only way this can get better is if it was priced under $10.00
5,works great!!! good price easy installation,"I have it installed on my small form factor Compaq EVO D510 desktop. My wireless router is a netgear in another room. The pc is inside my TV cabinet and the reception is ""excellent"". I am not using the extra extension antenna provided, only the fixed one."
4,i have the audio cassette,"i have the audio cassette of the same item, the same songs for sale, collectible , very good"
1,disappointing.,"Thumbed through this book in the store... Loved the idea, and the selection of topics - architecture, natural phenomena, etc. - really wanted to buy it. Ran across some typos... some missing information... and ultimately just plain bogus ""mathematics"": sin^2 + cos^2 =1. Well, sin and cos of what? As written, it's nonsense... there's nonsense all around us too, but I wouldn't want to read a book about it. Wondered why the publisher did not employ an editor... put it back on the shelf."
1,Totally inaccurate regarding setting,"I read this story several years back, and as someone who has actually been to Ocracoke I couldn't get past the inaccuracies, to the point that it just made me dislike what may have otherwise been a tolerable read. First of all, the entire beach on Ocracoke is undeveloped National Seashore, so there are no beach cottages as depicted in the book. There are also no cliffs or bluffs, as also depicted in the book. If you aren't going to be factual about the setting, you should just use a fictional island (and use a different state as well since there are no cliffs or bluffs on any part of the North Carolina coastline)."
3,Not one of her better ones.,"I love KB's books I think she is a great romance writter. However, Beachcomber left me feeling disappointed, i was actually somewhat bored by it which is not a feeling I have had with any of her other books. I think I should have waited for the paperback like a reader said."
2,Boring and predictable...,"I hadn't read a Karen Robard's novel in quite a while and this looked like a good romantic mystery - well, it wasn't a good romance nor mystery novel. By the second chapter I was skimming pages and literally had to force myself to finish it. Definitely not worth the money, so if you are a diehard Robards fan wait for the paperback."
3,okay but not up to her normal standards,"this was an ok book, but not up to normal standards by any means. ok, so what bothered me is how quickly Christy forgives Luke for lying to her. also, I never really got a feel for the characters and I didn't feel like they ever really got each other - that all that was there was lust.i also thought a lot of the plot was weak and not very realistic. all in all i wasn't as fond of this book as i have been some of her earlier books. that being said, it was decent, but not horrible."
3,Not one of her best,"I have recently started reading Karen Robards books.I enjoy romantic suspense novels. I loved 'Whispers at MidNight'. Based on that experience, I went ahead and puchased this book. While the book had great suspense, the romance was weak. One of the things that I enjoyed about her previous book was the character development. This book never spent much time on the relationship between the 2 main characters."
3,A fun summer read!,"Karen Robards is one of those authors I'll actually pay hardcover price for. Beachcomber is a fun summer read -- nothing too heavy or sophisticated. My only complaint is that you don't really get to know the characters very well, as the beginning of the book jumps right into the middle of the plot. There's little history about the alpha male, Luke, or the heroine, Christy. There are actually two plots working here ... the mob storyline revolving around Christy and her ex-fiancee and another about a serial killer. It'll keep you in suspense for a weekend or rainy day."
1,Don't waste your time and $$,"I'm so disappointed with this book. It started out great, just like any other Karen Robards novel, but this one had a disappointing ending. I had to check and make sure it was really written by Ms. Karen Robards. And all I could say was, ""What the heck was that??"" I can't believe I stayed up til 2 a.m. just to get to the end of the book just to be disappointed. A total waste of time and money. ( and lost sleep)"
2,Left me disappointed...,"I have been anxiously awaiting this book for months. When I read it, the ending left me disappointed. I don't want to give anything away to those who still want to read it, but I felt like I was so anxious to finish the story, and then I felt incredibly bored with it. I usually love books by Karen Robards, but this just isn't as good as her others."
2,"Sorry, but this book is not worth the money!","I know this is probably not politically correct, and this is supposed to be english literature, but this book is trully lousy. 1984 was okay, so if you're into Orwell's books, you can read that one. As for this one, it's only good for teaching in English class."
4,I read the back of this at a local shop:,"When I saw the picture on the front and I think that someone (maybe me if I could get the funding for them, I used to be a sound engineer but due to bad economy then you get the picture, things have been rough lately) - should turn it into a movie as well as the books by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child called THE CABINET OF CURIOSITIES AND THE BOOK OF THE DEAD - I believe that they would make fantastic low budget films or movies as some would call them.[...]."
5,F your ears! This is the Chariot!!,"I swear, every time I listen to this CD it still sounds new to me. It's like having your ears kicked one verse at a time.I've been listening to hardcore for years, but this band is one of the few that combines excellent vocals and lyrics over-top of some of the most brutal tracks ever laid down.Nothing about this is friendly. The entire CD is abrasive from beginning to end. They never even cut out the feedback through the mics. At first it's cringe-inducing, but then it's addictive.I would advise anyone who loves brutal hardcore to check out this CD, but only under fair warning. This is heavy and manic."
3,Let's get a little more feedback,"That is the prevailing theme on this record. Feedback. I enjoy the lyrics and the musicianship is fine; it's typical, but isn't everything? If you can get past the feedback then you shouldn't have a problem enjoying this record."
1,Solid state does it again...,"I have not heard an album in the past few years that I have liked at all. This is probably the worst. The Chariot is trying way to hard to be pretentious and artsy. I love analog recording and think it is great but they do make the mixing and editing for a reason. In fact, analog recording is still used a lot in the music indusrty, its just transferred to digital, which keeps all of the good parts of analog. The feedback on this album is the most annoying thing in the world. If there was anything decent on the album I wouldn't know. And what is up with the really long song titles? Quit listening to this faux hardcore crap."
2,"Norma Jean was ehhh, this is terrible","Contrary to popular belief Norma Jean's Bless The Martyr and Kiss The Child is not a good album. I won't get into reasons why just read my review of that album. But also it had stand out moments. That is what makes this cd even worse. It is uncoordinated, mindless noise and a huge disappointment for those who like Norma Jean's former singer. Since when is that ""guitar is too close to amp which has its volume knob too high"" feedback cool. Those of you who enjoy playing guitar with high gain distortion understand what I'm talking about. Most artists try to edit that sound out when their in the studio because IT GETS ANNOYING. So please if you with to avoid mindless noise and annoying repetition, don't buy this album. Instead buy Hopesfall- The Satellite Years, Anything by The Agony Scene or Zao- Where Blood And Fire Bring Rest"
1,Desperate Attempt,"This CD is downright horrible. It is just a bunch of random guitar riffs and drum banging. I am not into chaotic music and I can't see why anyone would be either. It has no rhythm and goes nowhere. Not to mention the CD is irritably monotonous with the same high pitched screech of the guitar throughout the majority of the tracks. If you are looking for real hardcore talent, try listening to Evergreen Terrace or Lamb of God."
5,very awesome cd. and a very awesome band!,"this cd is freaking sweet! If you like hardcore music, then you will really love this cd.The dvd is also worth a look too. You get some live footage which is great, because this band is one-of-a-kind live! they are one of the few bands who can leave the audience in fear of being hit by their instruments.Even though the cd is short, it is well worth the 27+ minutes that it takes up."
5,Solid !,"I can't put it any better. If you don't hear or buy this album you are missing out on what made Norma Jean so good in the first place. The Chariot are great, and like He Is Legend prove that Solid State Records knows what their fans want. You can not miss with buying this album....."
3,Not Bad Except For The Annoying Feedback,"When I first heard this CD I was amazed at how crappy the recording quality was considering they were signed to a major label. Everything was so messy and blended togehter. Having learned that this was recorded live with no overdubs it has grown on me and I'm able to listen past most of the excess noise... except for the squeeky guitar feedback in nearly every song. It gets annnoying after a while and I'm sure there is something they could of done to get rid of it. Yes, I know they wanted the raw, non-perfect sound but that doesn't need all the annoying high pitched squeeks. Musically though this is some damn good hardcore... good breakdowns, an excellent screamer and some great drumming. Just those damn squeeks!"
5,"this cd is good, but read on!","this cd is one of the most amazing cds ever made. no computers, no special editing, nothing! norma jean's Bless the martyr album doesnt even sound live compared to this! this truly is like being in the studio with the band. but this cd is only 27 minutes long, so i wouldnt reccomend buying it, get it burned. you pay 10-15$ and get less than some EPs have. nonetheless, this cd is the best hardcore/chaotic metal works of art ever made"
1,50% failure rate,"Two new SanDisk Extremem IV CompactFlash cards. A 2 GB & 4 GB. The 2 GB failed. Only had one failure on previous SanDisk cards in the past several years. One of my first two Extreme IV cards failed. The Extreme IV has some serious reliability issues in my experience. The 2 GB card was formatted, re-formatted, and fails after about a dozen shots. The camera, D300, was tested with 4 Extremem III cards and the working IV 4 GB card and no issues."
5,great,i love this painting. decent poster great price. color and paper quality are good what else is there to say.
3,"Dated, obsolescent","Mobius is an investment genius, of that there is little doubt. However, in 2012 this book is of very limited interest. It is largely a collection of facts about emerging markets as they were many years ago, and while many of the facts are interesting few have much relevance to investment and many no longer are true. For example, writing from Muscat he states that most men in Oman wear the Khanjar dagger. In today's Muscat this is not the case at all. Khanjars are worn there today as often as US Army generals wear cavalry swords. The book also has a chapter on the USSR, which is of course no longer an emerging market as it no longer exists.""EPICTETUS"""
2,"Deadly dull, with little insights","I guess I'm in the minority here. I was extremely dissapointed with this book. The writing is plodding, and I kept waiting for some good war stories, insights, or ideas and never got them.Sure, there are words on the page, so he must be saying something. It wasn't anything particularly new, original or really useful. Or memorable for that matter. He does include some personal stories, but they elicit a shoulder shrugging, ""So what?"".Invest your money elsewhere."
5,i LOVE Pollyanna Flower,the second song on this single is excellent! get it! the second song is worth it.
5,You're stupid to NOT get this.,"Even if you aren't very fond of Thank U, you should get this. Even if you already have the SFIJ import w/ the Uninvited demo you should get this. Why? Pollyana Flower is the best b-side around. Instead of a live cut like those on the JLP singles, this is an amazing studio recording that was almost put on SFIJ, but didn't make the final cut."
3,Good book,"I had picked this book up while preparing for the MOSS 2007 certification exam. While the book was informative, it was not appropriate for my purpose; a lot had changed between versions (2003 vs 2007). Still, it would be a useful book for someone who needs to learn (or brush up on) MOSS 2003, and I recommend it in that capacity."
3,Enjoyed the more gourmet style of recipes,"I enjoyed this little book. While it is not one if you are looking for a great quanity of recipes, it does have many different recipes in it. The recipes seem to shoot for the folks that like a little gourmet flavor to their recipes. They have a wonderful asparagus salad with blue cheese, pasta with white clam sauce, and all sorts of delicious pizzas. Recipes include nutritional value, this book is not particularly friend to Weight Watchers because they offer no fiber counts. All in all I bet that many can find several good recipes out of this book."
1,Terrible!,I just threw away my copy of this cookbook after yet another disgusting dish. The pictures are pretty but that's about it. All the other negative reviews have summed it up. Do not buy this book. It was a great disappointment!
1,"AWFUL, a huge waste of time!","I cooked from this book a few years ago (the penne w/sun-dried tomatoes & chicken) and it was so much time and preparation and wasn't worth all the work. I recently decided to give it another try and the same thing happened! 3 hours in the freaking kitchen for a mediocre dish! Again, no too much time and not much flavor. I'm giving this book away or throwing it away. It is requires many expensive ingredients and consumes too much time from preparation to serving. I think I'll stick with Giada, thank you."
2,Too little- Too complex,This book simply did not contain enough recipes- and these few selected did not offer much variation. Most of the recipes were time consuming and required a lengthy search of the ingredients and tools. I think you will find you just won't use this book much because of these reasons.
1,Waste of money,"Sure the receipes sound intriguing. But practical? Forget about it! Too many exotic ingredients and too time-consuming. If I were a professional cook for one person, I guess I could take the time for some of these receipes. However, if you have an additional life buy a different book!"
1,Not worth your time.............,"Io had heard great things about this small cookbook, but was let down. It offers very few recipes all of which range from bland to unappetizing. I also found very little variety.Cooking should be fun- this book amkes it more of a chore with too many ingrdeients- some of whish are pricey and hard to find! Cookbooks usually inspire me to try lots of new things, but not this one!"
3,"Good subject, average execution","I was really excited to see such subject tackled with : the Arctic war, the Russian planes, the Caucasus, etc... Too bad it overlooks the war against Japan... But the real problem is that it lacks rhythm, it lacks facts, good footage, the editing is quite poor, the interviews are horrible, lucky for us there aren't much anyway... What's been done by Daniel Costelle with ""Les Grandes Batailles"" is far superior, in his work you clearly understand the strategy step by step, you have poignant interviews of soldiers and/or officers, the editing is really well executed... it's even superior to the overestimated ""The World at War""."
3,Nice Piece of Propoganda,"Wasn't expecting the whole truth from the Soviet production, even worse than I thought it would be. They were still trying to blame the Katyn massacre on the Germans. Interesting anyway. Much of the film is just propaganda filmed during the war, but there is some real combat fotage."
2,Very Disappointed,"This treatment of the ""Great Patriotic War"" is so bereft of facts as to be comical! I couldn't get past the first DVD without gagging. ""The Germans attacked with 5 million men"" quote was absurd! (They attacked with almost 3 million). I cannot enjoy a DVD when it is packed with such obvious inconsistances. I should have heeded the Amazon reviews so I blame no one but myself!"
3,Only good footage,"There is a good filming images, not seen in other crapy documentaries, otherwise pure soviet propaganda, it is a pitty that such a good artist as was burt lancaster did the narrative of this full fake words. For those who knows deep history of wwii, they know the real causes that provoked it, and the dirty behaviour of all the leaders, churchill, stalin fdr and adolf, there were none of them angels , as some are portrayed"
4,A good review from the Russian prospective,The Unknown War provided an excellent prospective of the WW 2 German-Russian conflict from the Russian side. I would highly recommend this product.
3,Outdated Soviet Propaganda,"As other reviewers pointed out, this documentary is a soviet-backed documentary to serve as a counterpart to BBC's World at War, which in soviet eyes supposedly did not show the importance of the eastern front for the allied victory in its full extent. Unlike the famous british series, very instructive up until now due to the depth of the analysis provided intercalated with interviews of key figures of the period, this one might be considered outdated. If you are just interested in augment your private WWII archive footage, you should buy this series and this is why it deserves 3 stars only. But if you are interested to see a really instructive documentary about the eastern front, you should instead order the excellent ""War of the Century - When Hitler Fought Stalin"". Afterwards, if you are still not satisfied, please do not miss ""World War II: Behind Closed Doors""."
4,actually related in the book's manner ?,"Smith has made perhaps a unique association between the events chronicled in his book. The 1871 Chicago Fire. The 1886 Haymarket bombing. And the making of Pullman town. His descriptions of each are well done and quite readable. For this alone, it can worthwhile to peruse his writings, as he explains the circumstances of each. Of the events, perhaps the Chicago Fire is the best remembered. While the other 2 are relegated to the scrutiny of professional historians.I am unsure that despite his eloquent arguments, the events can be tied together as he so disposes. The presumed urban outlook shared by Americans of a century ago was shaped by many things. Maybe the events in the book were influential, but not decisive."
1,The Best Love Quotes??? Are you kidding?,"Where are the best love quotes? I didn't find any of them! I regret buying this book! Almost all if not all of the quotations are not interesting. Some doesn't even make sense! I do not know what the author was thinkng when she compiled this. The messages doesn't have an appeal. It's boring. Change the title... Love Quotations: A Collection of Boring Romantic Pictures and the Worst, Meaningless Love Quotations!!!"
4,No surprises,"Easy transaction. I ordered, paid for it, it arrived within the specified timetable. The text book was as it was described. I love that it has no highlighting or other marks, and no rips or tears :)"
4,This grill is alright,"I bought this grill mainly for pork chops used it today this cooked them thoroughly between 8-10m no problems at all.And man were they good,as far as cleanup goes not bad on stationary grill plates,use a damp sponge or a wash cloth.I rate this a good product,have to try chicken,burgers,and dogs next on this to see how they turn out.This heats up way fast and throws steam from the back hinge cover,anyway this does the job get's you away from the stove but it has a really short cord and a very large base."
2,no removable plate,i was not satisfied i wanted removable plate and it was listed under that but was not what it was supposed to be.
5,Very Impressive,"I did considerable research before I purchased this grill and I'm very pleased with the results. The grilling surface, while not huge, is quite large enough for a couple of good-sized steaks or several hamburgers or chicken pieces. It heats up quickly and cooks evenly and efficiently and I've found clean-up to be a breeze. At first I dismissed the little plastic spatulas as silly and useless but I found that they're the perfect size and shape for gently scraping the plates to loosen any food residue before swiping them with a damp paper towel or sponge.This is one product that works as advertised and I highly recommend it."
5,george forman grill,"the George forman jumbo grill in black is one of the best I've ever had. Cooking is fast and easy and the clean up is a breeze. We made burgers on it and grilled the onions to go with them, then put it all together with the bread and cheese and turned the grill into a pannini maker. The sandwiches came out great and only one thing to clean. .There was no greasy taste and only a little shrinkage. I recommend this highly. It has a large cooking area 120 sq. inches so you can really cook up a storm.George Foreman GRV120B 120 square inch non-stick cooking surface with extended handle, Black."
5,George Foreman Grill,Great product with a great size. The 120 sq inch is misleading - it should say 4-6 burgers grill easily. I am glad we upgraded to this larger size. It really isn't that big on the countertop. Definately worth the price. I love the all black case choice. Even my husband uses it to grill steaks.
3,It's Allright,"This was a replacement for an old & smaller size(original)George Foreman grill. The new grill cooking surface is much larger and accomodates cooking for my family of five. We have cooked burgers, chicken, pork chops and they have all turned out tender and with lots of flavor cooked in. My only complaint is that it does not have a built in timer."
5,Pretty decent size,"This is the best George Foreman grill I have ever had. I was hesitant about this model because of the size (I live in a small apartment). The size is perfect to grill two hamburguers or a steak. Even though it allows you to cook huge meals, it doesn't occupy a lot of space in the kitchen. Loved the color and the design. I highly recommend this product."
4,George Foreman GRV120B,This grill is basic. Plug in and wait for the light to go out. Make sureyou have a timer when you cook with it. There is no temp settingso check often.
3,Messy,"I was really excited when I got this a year ago, but it has spent 99.8% of it's time here just taking up space. It truly cooks like a dream, but is such a huge pain to clean that I haven't bothered with it past the first couple uses. Do yourself a favor and buy one with removable plates."
2,Too Poppy,"This Cd is too poppy. When I buy a cd from Olga Ta?on I want Merenegue, not run of the mill pop and 3 versiones of bandolero!"
3,Review,I thought this cd would be a lot better because I love Olga Tanon. There is one song that plays about 4 times with different music and I don't think that was necessary. Not pleased.
1,Horrible,"My friend game me this CD to definatly tick me off. It was something new so I gave it a try. It's man hating lyrics just left me especulating over how anyone can listen to this crap. To make it short, I threw this CD out the window."
2,"Not bad, but not needed to enjoy the excellent movie","Prometheus is a very good movie. This character profile of Noomi Rapace is the best of those from this cast. Still, you won't find out too much to enhance enjoyment of the movie itself."
2,Rather boring,Nothing special here and I found it rather boring. This character was not that inspiring to me anyway and this did not add anything to the character.
4,Butterfly Chair,The chair was better than I expected it to be but it did arrive broken. Amazon was quick to resolve the situation and I was very pleased with the outcome.
4,very solid hunt down the conspiracy story,"Our protagonist, a film buff, tracks the missing films of an obscure German director through twisted alleyways of conspiracy. Spiced with technical film information which can give you a new slant on the movies, the hunt is the thing and its fun all the way."
3,Tasty collection,"This is a good sampler of ""trip hop"" sounds circa '95. Standout track is T-Power vs. MK Ultra's ""Horny Mutant Jazz"", but watch out, Amazon seem to think ""horny"" is a dirty word, so they might not sell this to you!"
3,A Serious Novel of its Time,"Benson, best known for his many short stories and novels of social satire, here explores serious subjects: generational change in Edwardian society; what it means to be an artist; ethnographic comparisons of England and Germany; the courage one needs to make one's own way in society (even if the protagonist here has an independent income.) I found this book to be a feast best dipped into on different nights. For fans of the state of the English novel during the period before and after World War I, this book is an almost major treasure. Other authors, such as E M Forster, explore part of the ground but this book stands well on its own and repays continued attention.Why only three stars? Alas, this is stern stuff in comparison to Benson's hilariously telling 'Lucia' novels and in retirement I am perhaps more drawn to the ""page turners."""
3,Early treatment of Alzheimer's in fiction,"There is a great deal of pro-British, anti-German proganda in this novel, which I found off-putting. But it was still of great interest to me in that it features a character who is clearly suffering from Alzheimer's. The symptoms are accurately and vividly described and it is clear the woman has Alzheimer's as opposed to the many other forms of senility. This is something I've never come across in any of Benson's writing before."
2,Not the full versions,"I bought this DVD because it seemed like a good deal, however it does not have the full versions of the movie. It has @90 min versions."
3,Classics of Cary Grant,"If you're a fan of Cary Grant, you'll like these movies. However, be advised that these movies are un-touched and will have a lot of grainy blips and streaks. They obviously are copies of a copy, if you know what I mean. They are watchable and I would have given a better rating if the scratchy parts had been smoothed out a little. But then, what do you expect for three dollars? The only thing worse would have been one of John Wayne's first movies. The acting is OK the quality could have been a little better. Nonetheless, I bought this because I'm a Cary Grant fan and for no other reason but that."
2,Where's the beef,Check out the number of pages in this 45 dollar book. Many of these pages are insructions on how to get the examples loaded for the lesson and numerous other tasks that do not benifit in the acquisition of knowledge.I expect more content for a 45 dollar book. I would expect a reference book with a detailed index(2 pages in this small binder)I found myself spending most of my time scanning the pages trying to find the meat.
5,Senior Technical Writer,I consider myself an expert RoboHelp user now that I've completed the the Essential of RoboHelp HTML 9: Skill & Drills by Kevin A. Siegel.
3,Az Yet? No chance!,"When I heard Az Yet were back, I couldn't believe it. I loved their self-titled first album, had all the makings of a superb R&B; album. Tight production, nice slow jams, nice upbeat R&B; songs, and a smash hit (Last Night).When I bought this EP, I looked on the album and saw the groups names. I did a check on the first album, and found that only 1 original member is still in the group. The other 3 are new.This really disappointed me. How can they call this Az Yet, when only 20% of the original group is here? Sure there are some good songs on this EP, and if you like R&B;, then be sure to get the album when it drops. But for all you AZ Yet fans, be warned: 1 original member = nothing like original sound!!"
3,"""Introductory""",Be careful - there is an introductory (only goes to ch. 9) and a complete edition. I'm writing this because I did not pay attn and just realized (half way through my course) that I have the wrong one. Didn't want anyone else to make the same mistake...
1,Never Received Book,It has been over 3 weeks and I still have not received my book. I am behind in my class. Not very happy!!!
1,i did not recieve my item,i did not ever receive my item. i want my book or my money back please. i will let others know not to shop with you all. have a nice day.
2,Only for a 30GB Vision,"This case was designed for the first generation 30GB Zen Vision W, NOT the 1st Gen 60GB Zen Vision W...This was not called out on the web-site. As I opened the plastic clamshell packaging, Amazon/ANTonline would not authorize the return of this product."
1,I didn't buy this....,"and I'm glad I didn't rush to. I looked a little bit more on Amazon and found a company that sold a nice leather one with an attached kickstand! Just got it and it's AWESOME..the screen portion is covered by clear plastic and the front of the case is very well padded to avoid damage to the screen. Also, the unit slides into the case from the top so there's no chance it will fall out like this one. Take your time and look for it..it's leather and I think there were only 2 when I found them, so that means, there's one left. Here's the linkCreative Zen Vision W (30GB) Genuine Leather Case by Fosmon"
2,Not as advertised.,"""Power failure light goes on automatically during a power failure and lasts over 8 hours"" - if you expect {as I did} that this would be anything more than a very low yellow light you will be disappointed. It is a nightlight and nothing more. Should not be advertised as a power failure light. Decent flashlight if that is all you need."
5,Great Product at a good price!,Bought these 1 month ago and I wish I had more. Great night light where you need it and flashlight when you lose power in the dark. I've seen ones like in stores for a lot more money.
5,Great Product,"Easy to use, works well. Gives off a good amount of light. Product also works when there's a power outage."
4,This is the yellowest LED I have ever seen,"It works pretty well, but I am very surprised at how yellow the light is. I purchased this to replace a 5 year old white power failure night light that died and am still trying to get use to the yellow color.I recommend it since it does what I want."
4,Good product,We like them very much. We haven't had a power failure yet so we haven't gotten to test that feature yet and how long the battery will last. We will update our review when and if this occurs.
5,Great nightlight,"As a new mommy, I use these nightlights to be able to see when I'm up for nighttime feedings, etc. They are the perfect amount of light to see what you're doing and the lighting is soft enough that it doesn't wake the baby all the way up. The flashlight comes in handy during power outages and if you need actual light."
2,2 in 1,"It's a rechargeable flashlight which does two (not three) things: 1) turn on a yellow night light when it's dark, 2) turn on a white light all the time. It runs from a rechargeable battery, so it does these two things whether or not there is AC power being provided. To me, ""power failure light"" means that a light turns on when the power fails, but this product does not do that."
1,Tried twice,"I wish my night lights glowed as much as the reviews I read on this device. The bright amber nightlight feature was perfect for my stairwell application. But unfortunately the first one didn't work and neither did the replacement unit. With the permission of the supplier I took them both apart looking for broken connections, etc. and found large areas of corrosion (soldering flux?) and solder spatters on the bottom of the circuit board. Cleaned them both with alcohol and one worked for about one hour, then quit. Good-looking product with the features I wanted but bad workmanship and quality. BUT KUDOS for Grady's Online and Amazon for quickly sending out a replacement unit and for refunding my money: I wished the night light worked as well as they did!!"
5,It's been a hit,"My wife loved it. She had one link removed. The back of the watch face is more gray than the blue that the pictures seem to show, but otherwise, it's as elegant as it appears."
1,Stories for the gathering,As of yet I have not received the book - disappointing and doesn't reflect well with my previous experiences.So it's difficult to answer
4,Quite a good beginning,"The first installment of Tokyo Pop's Street Fury video magazine captures the import-lover's attention immediately. The car shots are many and beautiful, and there are plenty of drag racing shots, as well. The hostess is beautiful, and doesn't sound like an idiot. It has a decent soundtrack, when there is music. Plenty of interviews with famous drag racers.There are two things which keep this from being a five: first, and not too egregious is the sense of discontinuity throughout the magazine. One video segment doesn't necessarily lead into the next very smoothly. The more obvious fault of this video is the two characters thrown in for 'comic relief'. They drive around in a rustbucket and assault street racers, asking them questions about their cars, which proves to be merely annoying rather than funny.Street Fury Gold kicks off the series with a winner. If you're an import fan, pick this one up."
1,Missing,I was looking forward to receiving this print as I ordered that arrived and are great. This one never arrived. Extremely disappointed
1,Only DVD in this day and age?,"Everything about this collection is outstanding, except for one problem: Where is the Blu-Ray? Blu-Ray has been around for years now, with movies as low as $10, HD TVs have been around for years too. Its not like I'm requesting it to be in 3D. This is very similar to the Lord of the Rings Blu-Ray not including the extended editions."
5,Great Set,Loved this show when I was younger and now I get to share it with my nephew it is also way better than 90% of the other stuff on tv to day which he has been watching
5,love it,"what can i say, if you loved watching it when you were young you love it again. a must for all."
5,Awesome!,"Its G1, how can you not love it!!!! I can relive my childhood over and over. Amazon offer it at a great price and have excellent service! So Transform and Roll out to your computer and order this great set, you will not be disappointed..."
4,Great Value,"I have been wanting to get the Transformers completely collected on DVD for a while now. Until this set the price or number of different Box sets I'd have to get was more than I was willing to put out. But here you have Season 1-4 with a bunch of the original toy commercials and a few Documentary.The Quality of the show is top notch, the quality of the Commercials is iffy at best but watching them was like watching them in the 80's with a small TV an bad reception so it took me back and I did not mind the lower quality because it felt like I was a kid Again. For Any Transformer fan I Highly recommend this set. get this then find a copy of Transformers the Movie (also in the 80's) and you collection will be complete.Highly Recommend"
4,Transformers Box Set,"I bought this as a birthday gift for a friend who is a crazy fan of anything and everything Transformers. He has hundreds of Transformers action figures and many other collectibles but he did not have the original animated series; something he really longed for. I saw the Box-set online and had to purchase it. I can't comment as to the quality because I personally have not seen it but I have heard good things about it and can certainly vouch that the product arrived in perfect condition albeit not in a timely fashion. For those who don't have the money to fork over for the superior Transformers: Matrix of Leadership which contains not only the entire series but additional collectibles, this box-set is a nice alternative."
3,BEWARE!!! Season 3 is missing more then half the episodes!!!!,"What a downer to receive this box set and it is missing the start of season 3 The Five Faces of Darkness to the start of the disc ""Dweller in the Depths"". I just paid $50 for the COMPLETE set and it is not complete!!!! BOO to you SIR"
3,No Subtitels,"the product have arrived very quickly and i was so happy for that but when i tried using it (seeing the movies) no subtitles were available on any cd, this is a very disapointing issue for me since my child want's explanations on sentences said in the movie which are not always clear."
1,Transformers: The Complete Series about Closed Caption,Transformers: The Complete Series not have Closed Caption... i am deaf. i can't hear what they talk about. i need to understand what story about...
4,Throwback gift,"Even though I haven't officially bought this awesome DVD set,I know three people who will be receiving this as a xmas gift this yr. I grew up on this cartoon and was absolutely thrilled when it put back on the air recently. I get up in the 6:30 in the morning just to watch this series and I'm almost 30. lol. The point is, if you know someone who was into the movies as well as the cartoon, this could be a most excellent nostalgic gift for someone (who you will witness) revert back to the awe-struck child they were. Get it! Ive already added this to my xmas list and sent it out in emails."
5,Perfect! Good As Advertised!,The product was brand new as advertised. The only complaint I can make is that I didn't decide to purchase this collection sooner than I did.
4,Bleak and dark,"This is the bleakest book I have read in a long time but I persevered because of a general interest in the writing of this author.This book recounts the story of a woman who has been sexually exploited since her childhood and does so with gritty and uncompromising reality. For this reason, it is a difficult book to read yet I found it oddly compelling.Be prepared to find none of the characters in this book at all appealling, including the main protagonist."
1,tedious and boring,"This book is extremly slow, it never seems to lead anywhere. It makes one doubtful, as to, if there is ever a story line."
5,Great Book!,"O Lost is Thomas Wolfe's original version of his masterpiece Look Homeward Angel. I'd read the original novel and loved it, but this version is pure redemption, bringing justice to the hack job done on the original. The characters are more fully developed and plot holes are completely repaired. This used copy from a library was in near-perfect condition, the dust jacket protected in a plastic cover and the pages crisp and unmarked (perhaps due to the fact that hardly anybody checked it out!). The $9.99 price was completely fair. In all I had a great experience with this seller. Please read this book if you want the best of southern American literature from a pure genius."
4,Definitely worth seeing,"This video is quite good in general. I'm an art teacher and have been thinking about having my students do some sculptures inspired by Segal's work. The video shows him at work, and was very enlightening about the details of his method/technique for wrapping his models with the plaster gauze. I've always wondered how he dealt with the clothing on the sculptures. He actually wraps the plaster gauze right around the individual garments and folds of the model's clothes as the model is wearing them. Surprisingly, it didn't totally destroy the model's clothes! On another piece (a woman bending forward at the waist), if you look carefully, you can see that he has put aluminum foil over the top of her head and her hair to protect it. Really cool-- this is lessening at least some of my concerns about trying to do this in class. I think, though, that we'll just start with some arms/hands and see how it goes, and take it from there. If you like Segal's work, you will enjoy this video."
4,Cajun fryer,The fryer I purchased was sent with a damaged fryer insertThe shipper replaced the insert with a new insert but a different type than originally came with the unit .i actually like the new insert better than the original.Thank you for responding and taking care of the issue.
5,Works great,"I use this in college pool for lap times and total time for swimming three-quarters of a mile (i.e., 1500 yards in oplymic style swimming). Dropped in water twice. Still works great. Easy to use; easy to read to pool light conditions."
4,Hews Nicely Close to the German,"Kinnell and Liebmann's translations are spare and honest, hewing closely to the German and intelligently handling the less easily translatable passages, of which there are many. This volume brings you closer to Rilke's original thought than others, such as Mitchell, whose tone at times might be closer to Rilke's but who strays too far from Rilke's actual words. I only wish they'd translated more of the poems!"
2,"Close, but no cigar","Kinnell is a good poet, but his translations do not exceed those that have preceded him - Mitchell, Snow, Young, Bly, Franz Wright. He lets the German dictate to him too much and doesn't assert his own poetic talent to the degree that we might have expected. A lackluster performance."
4,"amazing poetry, bad translation.","rilke is one of my favorite poets, but the translation of this edition does his imagery little justice. fortunately, it comes with the german on one side of the page, the english on the other. i can't read german, but anyone who does can translate these poems for themselves."
1,Journey to the center of nothing,"This is probably the worst adaptation of the Jules Verne novel I have ever seen. This film is pathetic, nothing more. Don't waste your money on this horrible film."
1,Literally unwatchable,"First, the Center of the Earth looks a lot like just being out in the woods somewhere. LOLSecond, the Center of the Earth has plenty of blue sky. That is easy to tell because about every two minutes the director makes sure to cut in a shot straight up into the trees. Evidently this ""builds tension"".Another favorite camera technique is quick cuts in and out of close up, and then circling the actor/actress in even more jerky quick cuts. Evidently this ""builds tension"". It also threatened to give me a headache. Yes, I cut out on this loser FAR, FAR before the end."
1,A real stinker,"This movie was a real stinker. Poor acting, poor effects and sad excuse for a storyline. Don't waste your money unless you like pathetic movies!"
1,yes pathetic,"If you failed grade school, this may be for you. STAY AWAY. I would be interested to see who took such a great theme and butch it. Shame on the makers of this movie. 'Seems to be consistent with Asylum films. We rented it, watched about 10-15 minutes, replaced it with I Love Lucy, and asked for our $1.00 back. Though typical for todays rude, and obnoxious movie making, we hope the New Line Home Video version will be better. I gave it one star, only to be able to write this review."
1,Rough Journey!,"I bought this item thru a distributor in China for 12 bucks...11 more than its worth. At the time I was led to believe it was the new 3D version with Brenden Fraser. I'm in the process of trying to get my money back. Greg Evigan was a better actor in BJ and the Bear. He was the only semi-known actor in the whole movie. The CGI was first year graphics school and the ""actors"" were film school dropouts...at best! RUN FROM THIS MOVIE..SAVE YOURSELF!!!!"
1,Stop Asylum pictures,Asylum pictures make Uwe Bowles and Steven Segal movies watchable. This is another in a long line of no budget attempts to cash in on main stream movies.
2,It is not very good at all for a good yoyoist.,"I am an ok yoyoist, I can do many tricks. I think for a beginner it might be ok. For me and many others it is useless. I think the pictures were very bad and it did not very well discribe the trick."
2,Look for the First Printing,"For some reason, useful history and at least one trick was cut out of this printing. The yo-yo included is a diluted version of the ProYo (the older wooden yos from previous printings were a joy!) and a disappointment. Looks pretty, though. For some reason, Cassidy isn't credited with writing this book, but a committee is. When there was nothing else, this was fine (well, the first edition was fine), but this is really disappointing. Look for a book by Stuart Crump or Ted Whitten instead!"
1,Disapointing.,"If you want tricks do not buy this book! I found myself in awe at the simplicity of the tricks in this book. You can find all these tricks in a normal trick book and much,much,more."
2,could have been better,"This is a good book if you are five years old. Unfortunately, most people who take interest in yo-yos for more than five minutes are not. The history is interesting and the pictures are o.k. But when people open a yo-yo book, they look for one thing, tricks. This book is not big on tricks. Anyone with a little bit of sense can complete these tricks with ease. Two tricks in the book are a bit challenging, but then again, why would you buy a yo-yo book for two tricks? I am a bit surprized because I also own the Klutz magic book and I really found that book enjoyable. Klutz could have done better"
5,Delightful!,"Read this book with a glass of wine and an animal you love in your lap. Usually, I get books at the library, but this one's worth buying because it's the only coffee table book I own that people actually read. You can't resist picking it up because the pup on the cover is so cute, and then you start reading it, and the story is every bit as loveable and uplifting. The story pulls you straight through, just like Phil pulls Jill on their walks: all the way until midnight, through warm memories and cold weather, and afterwards you know you're a fuller person for having experienced the trip."
2,Not so enthralled,"My only thoughts about this book is that it might have made a good short story (very short) and that all the five star reviews are from former students or friends of Herman. It just isn't that good. The writing is OK but the problem for me is ""there is no there there"", no real heart to this little book. I finished it but the last pages were skimmed all the way."
3,not for the average dog-lover,"The subject of the book is the life of an irrelevant middle-aged never-married childless academic. She also has a dog. If you're interested in what goes through the mind of an irrelevant middle-aged never-married childless academic, this is the book for you. The dog isn't a very complete character and he is cruelly prevented from doing the things that dogs like to do, e.g., socialize with other dogs.If you want to read a great book in a similar genre, try Foreign Affairs by Alison Lurie. No dog in that one but she won the Pulitzer Prize (deservedly)."
5,Not for Dog Lovers Only,"DOG is that rarest of finds--a short, exquisite novel that feels rich and encompassing; a book about awakening to love and life that never preaches or ignores the complexity of life; and a book with a dog in it that isn't even once sentimental. Michelle Herman has written a lush book that seems too lavish for its deceptively small hand. Buy several: You'll want to give it again and again, and the people who receive it will thank you."
1,Not what I expected,The book was repetitive and self-indulgent. There was not enough about Dog except indirectly as a reflection or her needs. Overall it was boring.
4,"Short dog, short story","The writing in this little gem is lovely. And there's a dog. What else do you need for a good story? (Well, maybe a bit more resolution--but I'm old-fashioned that way.) I would not characterize this as a novel; with only one fully drawn character (unless you include the dog) and one problem, this really fits the form of a long short story. Still and all, it was a pleasant read and I look forward to seeing more from Michelle Herman."
1,Not what I was looking for,"Not hilarious or particularly interesting. The title is very misleading. The dog is a very minor character, and the main character is pretty dull. Not touching, charming, funny or uplifting."
2,Not a great read or reference.,"Do not buy this book. Purchase Hand Planes by Garrett Hock, or The Fine Art of Tools by Sandor Nagyszalanczy. These two books would serve you better in you woodworking future. They are both better reads with much greater information. This is a watered down version of the two. With uninspiring photos."
5,Wow what a book!!!!,"This author knocks me out everytime I read his stuff. If you want to read a book that cuts through all the mess and gets to the heart of the matter, this book is a must read. I learned I am not limited by my age or any other thing in my life. Don't be fooled by the title. I am in my thirtys, which is still pretty young, but this book is about having a different mindset. It is a book for everyone, and I loved it."
1,pure crap,"This iron worked ONCE and that's it. Now it won't heat up at all, even at the highest setting. Waste of money."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this after reading some reviews saying this was a fast and easy way to change up your hair style. I opened this as soon as it came. I have long, straight hair so I needed a change! Sadly, this did not work at all. It also came with no instructions. I could see some wave in my hair when I first started but by the time I got to the other side of my head the wave was gone from the side I started with. By the time I got done with all of my hair it looked frizzy and like I just woke up. I'm Very disappointed. I was thinking about returning it but I've decided to look online for a video on how to use it. Hopefully it will work out better! At this point i wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,DO NOT GE THIS HEAVY BEAST GET THE CONAIR CRIMPER,"I got this waver just a couple minths ago and it seemed ok, the waves take for ever to form and they eventually fall out or get tangled ugly. This iron is soooo heavy you get tired of counting to 30 for each wave! So I researched and went and sprung for the Infiniti conair crimper! Pay the extra money and get what is better for sure!!! AWESOME Infiniti CONAIR it is light, waves are perfect and created in a 5 second time frame and it is super light, so dont waist your money on this crimper, its a pain in the ACE!!!"
3,very heavy tool,"This waver works well, but it is very large. It is a little awkward handling it. I do not suggest this waver if your hair is short/medium length because of its size."
5,Would definitely recommend!,Great product and creates the loose 1920's curl I want. I would recommend turning the curlers on for a while before use....Just be careful not to burn your ears :(
5,Hair waver,I love this iron it noes even fine or super straight hair wavey the price Is so worth it every girl should have one
2,Made my curly hair straight,"I wanted a waver to control my curls not straighten my hair. I was going for a wavy tousled look. The waver made my hair straighter and it worked a little bit with gobs of curling mousse. It just wouldn't hold the wave. I'll try a few other curling products with then, if it doesn't work out it is being donated."
1,"Purchased yesterday, Returning today...","I was so excited when I got this product that I decided to immediately use it on my hair. My excitement soon turned to frustration. The barrels never got hot enough.. I was able to touch the barrel with my hand without burning myself. Needless to say no ""beachy"" looking waves were left impressioned in my hair. (And I have fine stright hair.. the easiest to manipulate)The design of the product is quite horrible. It is heavy and the square-shaped handle make it very uncomfortable to use. Don't bother!"
1,Please save yourself the time and trouble,"I bought the Jumbo Waver yesterday. It never heated up even once. Exchanged it today and the new one doesn't heat up. Right out of the packaging. Now, I'll have to go back to the store and return it. I thought Revlon was a good company. What has happened to their quality control?"
5,Love it .. love it .. love it,"Easy to use. Take me 15 minutes to do the whole hair.Looks like I have natural curl.At the beginning I have to learn how to use it, but once I figure out, it is easy."
4,Good product but way overpriced!,"This curling iron did a good job. The waves were nice and big just how I wanted them. I was afraid that they would be just crimped looking but this iron does create beautiful waves. However, I saw the same exact iron at walmart a few days later for $9.99 and I paid 19 something for it online. You can imagine my disappointment especially when you add shipping and all I had to do was go right down the street for the same item. It's a good product just look for it in walmart or another type of retailer before you buy it online."
2,Not hot enough for curls but,"I bought this product recently. I've to say, it doesnt get hot enough so waves wont stay on. But, ironically, the outside face of the bottom plate (not the two barrels but the opposite part) gets extremely hot and since is a wide area, it's easy to get burn."
4,goooooood,&#1585;&#1608;&#1593;&#1607; &#1588;&#1608;&#1610;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607;&#1605;&#1585;&#1585;&#1585;&#1607; &#1606;&#1575;&#1610;&#1587; &#1575;&#1606;&#1589;&#1581; &#1601;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1575;&#1607;&#1604; &#1608;&#1576;&#1593;&#1583;&#1610; &#1605;&#1608;&#1576; &#1594;&#1575;&#1604;&#1610;&#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1576;&#1610;&#1575;&#1593; &#1605;&#1585;&#1585;&#1585;&#1607; &#1588;&#1575;&#1591;&#1585; 3 &#1575;&#1610;&#1575;&#1605; &#1608;&#1608;&#1575;&#1589;&#1604;&#1607; &#1604;&#1585;&#1610;&#1575;&#1590; &#1605;&#1575;&#1588;&#1575;&#1569; &#1575;&#1604;&#1604;&#1607; &#1593;&#1604;&#1610;&#1607; &#1610;&#1587;&#1578;&#1575;&#1607; 10 &#1606;&#1580;&#1605;&#1575;&#1578; &#1607;&#1608; &#1608;&#1575;&#1604;&#1580;&#1607;&#1575;&#1586;
3,Maybe for someone else,"I have always had this romantic fantasy of having long ""beachy"" hair, so I ordered the Jumbo Waver and ended up with a frizzy fro. I am no hair expert, I'm clumsy and more than a little bit impatient, so take this with a grain of salt, but for me, after using this awkard thing (and burning myself twice), I ended up with a ""non style"", so I brushed it out to make it look more ""beachy"" and that is how the fro happened. If you're skilled with these kind of tools perhaps this will work great for you, but for me it was a flop."
1,Piece of junk!,"I don't know what everyone is talking about with these good reviews! This stupid thing is useless! It barely put any waves in my hair. In fact, it just made it look like my hair was a mess, and not in that deliberate, sexy way. I got slightly better results when I tried it on really thin sections of hair, but the results were still pretty ugly. Save your money for the salon! This tool is a waste."
1,cheap made,"This product is cheap made, waited 21 days for this item to arrive and opened up the oversized packaging box and found no coushining in the box to protect the product, of course the product was broke. I was very unhappy and mad this was supposed to be a christmas gift but as seen above arrived 4 days after christmas. Don't buy this cheap piece crap and don't rely on the tracking either they say its somewhere but its really somewhere else. Never again i will purchase a product like this."
2,refund the money,I bought the product from the site last month on 5\8\2011. Then I refused the order . After that the money cut from my account and until now I did not get the my money and did not get the order.
2,Waver,I bought this thinking it would make cute waves in my hair. I didn't like it because it's too big and clunky and I wasn't crazy about the kind of waves it made. I will just let my hair air dry and keep my natural curls/waves.
3,it broke,after having it for a week the handle broke and there was no way to fix it! it is a great product just made cheap. how do i get a refund or replacement?
4,"great result, easy to use","the 3-barrel waver is a quick, easy way to get loose, bouncy waves. it takes me 5-10 minutes to do my whole head and it's fairly goof-proof. my only complaint is that the iron is large and bulky, making it more difficult to manipulate than it needs to be. i highly recommend it regardless and the price is fantastic."
2,"Bulky, Awkward and Poorly constructed","I like the look this iron gives my hair but it takes a while and it is awkward and bulky to use. Be preared to burn yourself quite a few times in the begining while learning how to manipulate the iron in order to achieve the best results. The wave look only lasted a few hours in my hair as well. Also, I only had it for about 2 months, using it maybe every other week and it just stopped working. It turns on but doesn't get hot anymore. I would not recommend this product after using it. I just ordered another brand after reading its reviews so I hope it workes better than this one did. It will give your hair a wave look if you go slow and use small sections but as for quality and easy to use I have to say that it fails..."
3,Used to have a Vidal Sassoon Deep Waver,"Even though I had a deep waver from Vidal Sassoon I ordered this one because I liked the ""curling iron barrel style"" opposed to my other one which made my hair a little kinky. This one works a tiny bit better but not much. My hair still looks kind of kinky and I wish the waves looked a little looser and more natural, but the price was outstanding if you just wanted something to switch up your straight hair every once in awhile. It is quite time consuming and awkward to use also."
3,$70...WTF?,Why is this selling for so much when other sites have it for about 25 dollars. It is the exact same product. Am I missing something? I love the look this iron gives your hair and I want to buy one but can someone explain the pricing to me.
3,it doesn't give you ringlet curls,I was really excited to get this 3 Barrel Jumbo Waver because the picture didn't show the girl with ringlet type curls it gives you hope. This just does big waves. I does look pretty and kind of reminds me of a 1940's hairdo which was pretty. It is easy to work with.
3,Quit working!!,"Got this & absolutely LOVED it!!! That is until it stopped working after a few months of use. Hardly worth it. I am now ordering a new one, but am seeing that others have had the same problem as I am with it suddenly not heating up - just barely getting warm. Think I may be trying a new brand. I have fine hair, and love the look that this gives me. I found that my curls work better when my hair is a little 'dirty'. When I've done it just after shampooing, my hair is just fluffy & fly-awayie. If I do it after a day or 2 of not shampooing, and then just separate curls with my fingers - it looks great. Tons of compliments. Had alot of fun with it & am SO sad it isn't working now! Shouldn't be having to buy a new one (or should I say a different brand) so soon. Revlon, I am so disappointed!"
5,Quick and easy hair!,"On days where I have 20 minutes to get ready, I use this. It is pretty huge, and my friends make fun of me when I use it, but they compliment my hair all the same. It gives the look of post-braided hair; without the frizz and un-even lines. I recommend doing your hair in layers so that you can get more waves and fuller hair; also use heat-protection because this gets HOT.It' easy and convenient. NO problems so far at all."
2,Broke after 3 weeks,While this does get very hot and will provide a nice wave on long hair it will not last long. I am a hair stylist and I used it about 4 times and it stopped heating up. Won't waste my money again. Looks like others on here have complained about it breaking as well.
4,Fun waves!,My husband bought this for me and my 11 year old daughter for Christmas. It gets hot fast and there is a knob that you can turn to adjust the heat. It was simple to use and my daughter mastered it better than I could! We have had a blast using it and I would recommend it to anyone.
2,breaks after one use! I give up!,"This is the second waver I have ordered from Revlon in 3 weeks. My daughter uses it once, twice, maybe three times and the handle just breaks right off. This morning she had her hair half waved, and had to get a pot holder to hold the clamp shut so she could finish her hair before school. She loves what the waver does, but this design is so poor! The plastic is too weak for the weight of the appliance. I thought the first one breaking was a fluke; so I re-ordered the same one......with the same results. Not again, we will try a different brand!"
3,Good for loose waves but..,"It's very easy to burn your self with this barrel, since it's so large! It gives nice loose waves but not tight waves.Overall it's a good hair tool, and heats up VERY quickly. :)"
1,Design flaw,"Keeps shutting off. When I squeeze the handle to close the barrels together, the on/off switch is directly underneath it and shuts it off. Works GREAT when I can keep it on"
2,Made my hair frizzy and poofy,"I was really excited to use this waver. I am always look for ways to get that beachy, wavy hair, however this waver didn't really do that. It did wave my hair, however it left my hair kinda frizzy and really poofy. I have asian hair that is about medium thickness. I like more subtle and uneven waves, which is why this product wasn't good for me. I have watched other reviews about this product, and it seems to work for a lot of people. I just did not like how the waves looked too perfect and even. If you are looking for really big wavy hair this product is for you, but if you want that unruly beachy wave.. this may not be the right product."
3,I just can't get my hair to wave,"I saw this product in a youtube video and the girl's hair came out so beautiful, however i just can't seem to get it, idk if it's cuz my hair is curly or what but the waves come out frizzy and burned even without leaving it the waver on hair for long. I don't know what i am doing wrong, but maybe for others depending on your hair will be better. It's a good product, warms fast and durable."
2,Cheap,"The product heats up fast and creates beautiful waves but you get what you pay for. I had this item for a week and after using it several times, the stand and handle broke. It snapped right off. The ceramic is really cheap and I don't think it can handle a lot of heat. The iron is also pretty heavy. I would recommend paying a bit more for another product."
4,Good,I love my crimper and my boyfriend loves my hair after I use it to do my hair. :) I've burnt myself with it a couple times but I think once I get more used to using it will work great and not burn
1,Worked Great...Until it Didnt...,Stopped working 2 months after purchase date. Just didnt turn on anymore. Other people seem to have had this problem too. My verdict...don't buy.
5,Love it!,"I love this waver, its a good price, and the waver is nice and big so it makes it a little faster to wave your hair than the smaller ones. I havent had a problem with the product yet. I just didnt like that it doesnt have a stand to put down on the counter. Besides that, it styles my hair very well."
5,Much fun!,"I bought this iron after seeing the waves in a friend's hair. ""Is that your natural wave?"" I said. She told me how she did it, and two weeks later I bought the waver. It's easy to use (that is, uncomplicated to make the waves you want and it doesn't take forever) and it works very well."
3,Great UNTIL it no longer works,"I LOVE this waver, but unfortunately I only got to use it a few time (3) before it no longer would get hot. I was so sad. It worked so well on my long, Straight, straight, sleek, thin hair. I plugged it in and the light came on and it got hot. I was able to do about three sections of hair before I realized it was no longer hot enough and then it went cold. I tried other sockets, but it didn't help. I read other reviews about this happening,but figured I would give it a try. I do like it enough to purchase it one more time and hopefully it will last longer =)UPDATE: Well, it's been a year since I've purchased my 2nd deep waver and it is still working. The only problem I have with it is that it makes my hair have a burning smell after using it. I even use it on a very low setting. It may just be my hair, but curling irons don't leave my hair with that smell."
4,Fantastic curling iron,"This is a great purchase. It works quickly and easily, it only took me a couple of uses to get it down very well. The only thing reason I didnt give it all 5 stars is because periodically when you squeeze the handle, you will hit the on/off switch and unknowingly turn off the iron, which you probably wont notice until your hair stops curling. Once you realize you do it though, its easy enough to reposition your pressure so you dont turn it off, so the problem is easily solved."
2,hair waver,"I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. Even on its highest setting it doesn't work very fast. I have to hold it in my, or my girls', hair so long that my arm gets tired and I find I rarely want to use it."
2,Not too shabby,"The Revlon waver isn't too bad of a product considering that it's only $20. The waver produces nice waves, but only when used with hair wax or a wet-effect spray so that the waves don't look too frizzy. The iron is extremely heavy, is awkward to hold, doesn't heat up very quickly and isn't very hot so it's a pain to hold the HEAVY iron in place for at least twenty seconds for each section to have the waves set. I have very fine hair and not too much hair, so if this iron takes a long time to do my hair, I imagine it will take much longer for people with coarser hair. The iron doesn't have tourmaline plates so your hair doesn't look shiny and is easily damaged. Pros: the waves stay tight and looks the same as when you first ""waved"" your hair even after a day."
1,Don't waste your money,Bought this curl my daughters hair- took for ever to heat up. Tried it on her hair barely made a wave- and the wave it did create was frizzy..... Took it back and didn't bother trying another.
2,not what i expected,This waver worked well to make your hair look like you took it out of a braid or srunched up. It does not look natural at all. I bought it as a waver to get a vintage look and it doesnt work for that. If you try to brush and tame the waves they just get frizzy.
2,Lovely Design,"I really looked forward to putting waves in my hair with this. The size of the waves would have been so perfect. The problem is that it never got hot enough. It would get warm and I would have VERY mild waves that would completely disappear no more than 90 minutes later. I would even use lots of extra time on each wave--if I used just the standard amount of time I use with any other styling device, it wouldn't hold at all. I also put hairspray on before I used it which would normally be somewhat dangerous with products that heated up to a normal temp and still it barely workedIt wasn't just theRevlon RV084C 3-Barrel Jumbo Waver with CeramicI had originally purchased that was defective. I so loved the design that I exchanged it at the store I purchased it for another one. The replacement didn't warm up either.The ones that gave this 5 stars must have seriously thin hair."
2,2 stars for brand name & reliability minus 3 stars for design,"I bought this, used it once or twice and gave it to charity. It is clunky and large, the barrels are not traditional nonstick or chrome but made of a porous-looking material that doesn't allow your hair to slide like the nonstick, ceramic or chrome ones do. I have fine hair that isn't real thick and three teen & adult daughters who live at home. We all tried this and didn't like it or the resulting hairstyle at all and we all have varying degrees of thickness to our hair (all long though). The results were strange looking like you used the old fashioned hot curlers with the metal clips and they left lines in your hair. It says with ceramic on the title but this isn't like the ceramic curling iron I recently purchased."
2,Revlon Wave Iron Clunky,"I bought this iron to replace my Vidal Sassoon 3 barrel waver with high hopes of producing the mermaid-like waves i envisioned.This wave iron is HUGE. it is like a giant robot claw, except with heat.I have small hands and arthritis, so i found this tool almost impossible to use. Because of the weird clamp plate, it is difficult to get the tool close to the head to make a nice wave all the length of the hair.This would be better for picking up dead mice; or smashing spiders.Would NOT purchase again."
1,It's broken!,"I used it only once, and it broke down.I never dropped it.Its handle is broken!I just use it once but I cannot use it twice!"
2,Broken after 4 uses,"I really wanted to love this hair styler. It did great things for my hair, and produced the results that were promised on the packaging. However, after only 4 uses the handle completely snapped off rendering the iron unusable. I have put in a call to Revlon's customer service, as I am quite displeased with the quality of this product, and after having spent $25 on it at Target, I am feeling a little jipped. Spend the extra money on a better quality item. You'll be happier in the long run."
5,best krimper,"super HOT. People are just amazed at how well this product performs. Bought for 10yr old, should have adult supervision."
3,Fun hairstyle,My teenage daughter wanted the Revlon Jumbo Waver to have another way to wear her hair. It's been easy for her to use and the waves are reallycute. The only complaint is that it's bulky but I don't know what they could do to alter the iron and still achieve the same hair style. FYI: I didn't pay this much for mine. Shop around. You can get it much cheaper.
3,works pretty good,"it holds a wave which is saying something cause my hair doesnt, and my only issuse is that it gets really hot and i burn myself, but im not blaming that entirely on the product itself i've used it like 5 times and im starting to like it more and more"
3,Glorified crimper,"I just got this today and am pretty disappointed. When I used it even on small sections of my hair it just looks like a big crimper - definitely does NOT look natural, so I feel silly wearing the style. Going to return it in favor of one of the wand curling irons."
2,"Liked it, but it broke after 3 uses!","I really liked the jumbo waver when I first got it...took me a couple times to figure out how to use it the way I liked. Just as I got the hang of it, the handle broke that opens and closes the waver! I never dropped it or mis-used it, so I don't know what happened but I'm sending it back and hopefully they will replace the darn thing."
3,Almost never use it,"My hair is very thick and very long and curly. I have to straighten my hair first and then when I tried to use it, it snags too sometimes. For the most part, I don't use it at all.I gave it to my daughter, but I have not seen her use it neither. This is good for not so thick hair, so that is why I gave it three stars, or I would have given it two stars, because for people like me, it has really no use to even try to get it largely wavy. If I want my hair to be wavy, I just figured out to put it in a bun on top of my head and let it stay that way for a while."
2,Too Heavy,"If you are considering buying this iron, please realize how HEAVY it is and that a strong adult will have to assist any teenage girl attempting to use this. My poor daughter burnt her shoulder pretty bad as the iron does get nice and hot but weighs a ton! You literally need two hands to hold it and after about 5 minutes, your arms will start to shake from holding it up. It does make nice waves, but the process is a bit tedious as you can only curl one short section at a time. I just want people to be aware that they will need assistance when using this product."
4,Revlon- 3 barrel Jumbo Waver,"Was very skeptical when I bought this waver since I'm not a big fan of other Revlon's hair product, but this 3 barrel Jumbo Waver is GREAT! It's very easy to use, heat up very fast and creates that ""beachy"" hair waves very quickly. I have coarse hair (and use setting 20) and it takes me less than 15 mins to do all my hair, and the waves last the whole day :) The only thing with the waver is that there is no safety stand for it, so just have to be careful where you put it or u might burn the counter since some part of the metal will be in contact with the counter."
2,Looks are deceiving,"It was very much larger than the pic. It looks standard size on the pic, but when we received it. It was too big!"
5,works great,I just tried this & it does exactly what I wanted it to do! the trick is to use smaller sections like half an inch at a time.
3,A real character - then you had to go and spoil everything!,"I identified so strongly with the lead character, Cecily. The story was wonderful and I connected with the local scene of Atlanta, Georgia. I have but one problem. We were so into the character - then up pops the cliches of Cecily having the perfect ""look"" - now, why did you have to go and spoil everything? It was nice to have a character we can relate to as real women (financially despondent, etc.) and we hear Cecily described (numerously) as beautiful, perky, petite, blonde, etc. Next time, Karen, really blow our minds and create a character that is REAL and still wins our hearts. How about a little cellulite, a large rear end? Pasty white skin? Clever writing about the financial situation, all the same. I'd buy another book. Please, are you listening to me? How about a leading character that is not a size 4?"
3,"Good value, however...","This is a good set of western films, however...the set does NOT include the Rod Cameron/Gale Storm version of ""Stampede"". The box says it does, but it is in fact an older film called ""Stampede"" with Charles Starrett. Considering the fact that I bought it for the Cameron/Storm movie...I must say I was very much NOT pleased. So if that's the film you're buying the set for...it isn't on there!"
1,Not as good in person,"This item was rather disappointing - it looks much better in the back-lighted product photo than it looks in person. I did expect the pvc plastic disks to be more rigid, but they were in fact very soft & flimsy and some had curled in shipping. The company was fine to deal with, but I did not keep the item due to the way it looked."
3,It lights up....,"For fifteen bucks it lights up, but it has a push-in on and off switch. I keep mine in my tool bag for when I go in attics and stuff. Every couple days I can see it flashing in the side pocket I put it in. I wish it had a slide switch on it so this wouldn't happen."
2,Please read before to buy!!!,"this is the ""BLACK"" tape not the white like shown in the picture... I made the mistake of just looking and buying instead of reading... so not happy... but im sure its good for whoever really uses the black tape but I don't only the white!"
2,I thought this book was boring and not very interesting.,This story is about a family that sings and comes on TV every Friday.The main thing about this story is when a man calls James(JimmyJo) and says he his real father and finds out he really is.But Lames doesn't have any kind of relationship with his real father.
3,Which is Better?,"If you're looking for a documentary on the life of Truman Capote, you have two choices:* Truman Capote, A&E; DVD Archives (2005) [ASIN: B0009HMTFS]; and* Great Writers: Truman Capote (2000) [ASIN: B000FC2HNG]Neither one is inexpensive, so I would have liked a review saying which one is better. As it turned out, I ended up buying and watching both. Although both programs are of roughly the same length, the differences are significant.The Arts & Entertainment (A & E) version is clearly better. It has more information, photographs, film footage, and interesting interviews than the Great Writers version, which seems to be trying to make some sort of artistic statement of its own - lots of pictures of grass waving in the wind, country roads, etc., none of which are terribly relevant.You will be better off buying the A & E program."
2,Modest Production Makes This Only So-So Bio,"This is an extremely modest 45-minute video of the life of Truman Capote. Although a couple of actors read several long passages from Other Voices, Other Rooms and Breakfast at Tiffany's, there is less than three minutes use of actual footage of Capote speaking (including about fifteen seconds of the author himself reading from his first novel), and none of it has him commenting on his fiction (or even his journalism). There are no interviews with anyone who knew him or any writers of his generation. Although the commentary does cover the events of his life pretty well (more on his writing than his mascot years performing for New York cafe society), the whole thing feels very thin. Quite a let down."
3,A Poorly designed book...,"In the first 50 pages of this book and then periodically throughout its remaining pages, the photos of the women wearing these tiaras are about the size of a postage stamp, surrounded by large blank white areas. Talk about eye strain... A waste of paper and space. Later in the book some of the tiaras have their descriptions on the page opposite their photos, again, with a large area of white space surrounding the text. All this empty white space could have been used for LARGER PHOTOS. Some other descriptions for 4 consecutive tiaras are on the pages following the photos. Very unorganized, and poorly planned. It would have been SO much better to be able to see how these creations looked on people. Many of the larger photos of the tiaras are lovely, however, a number of them look like a ""cut and paste job"". Nice to see the jewels, however I think this book is just so-so."
3,Postage stamps!,"Wow! Other reviewers were not kidding about the postage stamp sized photos. The pages above that say ""Look Inside"" with 3 photos across, actually show some of the LARGER photos. Many of the other photos actually are, literally, the size of a postage stamp. What were the editor's thinking? I've been holding off buying this one because of those descriptions, but finally gave in, as many of the other photos are full page. I bought this used for less than the cover price, and I think it's worth it for that price. However, if you can only buy one tiara book, pick one of the Geoffrey Munn books. The photographs are much better in his."
3,Overrated,"The jacket blurb engrossed me at the bookstore. I shelled out the hardback price. I immediately found gross similarities to Christianity, Nazi Germany,etc. The novel intrigued me until I realized where the author was going. It could have been a great book but became predictable. A bit more imagination would have helped"
2,Don't believe the hype on this one.,"I bought this book because of recommendations posted on a couple of boards (turns out they were all posted by the same person) and was very disappointed. The writing is heavy-handed and hard to slog through and the plot fragmented. It is not particularly original despite the over-blown jacket copy (Rushdie? I don't think so.). I gave to my father-in-law to read and he couldn't get through it, saying it was what they used to call 'turgid prose'."
1,Wordy? An understatement,"Paul Witcover, Waking Beauty (Harper, 1997)After three long months of wrestling with this monstrosity, I finally gave up. ""Ponderous"" is the best word to describe Witcover's style, which plods along with no consideration for the reader whatsoever, and little more for the characters therein. Things happen to the characters, all of which are described in lush detail, but somehow the detail never manages to convey any emotion whatsoever. If you've managed to learn to care about what happens to anyone in this book within the first fifty pages, you're doing a whole lot better than I did. And it never gets better. (zero, of course)"
2,"Ultrak 100 Lap Memory Timer, Black",This stop watch did not have the memory of other watches I have ordered. I need to have a memory lap of at least 10. We time job elements to come up with a total time.
1,Vintage Roses,A really awful book. Certainly not worth the price and definately not the cost of shipping. I threw it away.
1,Put a tin can in a microwave and add poor vocals.,"My title says it all. Combichrist is grossly unimaginative and untalented. Any two year old with a drum machine and a sampler can create this music (i'd know). Their vocals are cruddy and off tune. The only good thing about this band is the hot percussionist girl in the ""Get Your Body Beat"" video."
3,"Entertaining, if not overly inspired.","Though I am more of a dark industrial fan with tastes aligning more to the likes of Skinny Puppy (ie. Too Dark Park) than the more techno-based musical styles, I certainly don't mind a little more of the later either. Combichrist's ""Everybody Hates You"" is full of dancy, catchy songs that are great for a night at the club. A few of the songs can get a little repetative, such as ""Happy F***ing Birthday"", which is my least favorite track on the album. ""This Is My Rifle,"" and ""Blut Royale,"" are a couple of my favorites and are heard in the clubs quite a bit of late.Lyrically, ""Everybody Hates You"" is not particularly inspired, but when you're dancing that is not really the most important thing.Overall, this album may not be my favorite for listening to at home, and I rarely do. But if you're looking for some upbeat, fast-paced, edgy, dance music, this is certainly something to consider for any fan of the genre."
4,"simple, effective",works fine. wish it were made out of metal though. the plastic feels a little cheap. the inside of the hood is coated with a nice matte fuzzy material to avoid reflecting light; a really nice touch.
3,Good lens Hood,"As often with Canon, the products are of a good quality but rather on the expensive side. I think that Canon should really include hoods with its lenses."
4,"Great Product, Great Design, Good Build Quality","PROS====1. Fits the EF 50mm F1.4 perfectly!2. Fits on reverse for storage3. Made of High quality plastic4. Has a felt lining inside...nice touchCONS====1. TOO much money! Probably cost Canon $5 to produce this.Conclusion==========This product is fantastic. Did I pay too much for it? Maybe, but I'm not upset considering what it accomplishes and the fact that I'm potentially protecting my $400 lens should it be dropped.In short, I paid $30 on the Canon Brand ($10-15 too much) to make sure that it fits properly and lasts for the life of the lens.Well worth it...I would have given 5 stars if this cost under $20 like it should!"
5,Insurance for your lens,"I wish I didn't need this - works like it's supposed to: keeps sun, fingers, and everything else away from the lens glass. It seems a ridiculous price to pay for plastic, but a bargain for the peace of mind I guess."
3,Great $5 Lens Hood,"Unfortunately, it costs over $30. Great feel, works as advertised and will definately up the quality of your shots and reduce glare with the 50mm lens. How Canon can charge $30 for $5 worth of plastic and felt is beyond me. If you can find a no-name alternative for much cheaper, I would take it."
1,Price is a ripoff...,"I see other people on here saying this product is expensive at around $30.00, but the price listed on this page is $90.00. I thought that was ridiculous. Adorama has its own version of this hood for about $16. That's who will be seeing my money."
4,"NICE HOOD ,HIGH PRICE",A LENS HOOD IS A LENS HOOD BUT MANUFACTURER'S HOODS ARE USUALLY BETTER THAN 3RD PARTY MANUFACTURERS. THIS IS THE CASE HERE.I WOULD RATE THE ITEM 5 STARS EXCEPT FOR THE PRICE. IT IS A 5 STAR FOR WHAT IT IS INTENDED TO DO----CUT DOWN STRAY LIGHT.
2,Canon Lens Hood,This product is over priced. I would recommend that you purchase a Lens Hood from a secondary market manufacturer.
2,Less expensive alternative,I bought a less-expensive alternative from [...] for [...] (shipping included). Arrived in less than a week fro Hong Kong. Fits perfectly.
4,A Bit of a Loose Fit,"This lens hood for the 50mm f/1.4 is a standard, very good hood. However I have found that it doesn't ""click"" into place as firmly as my other Canon hoods (for other lenses). Perhaps it has worn a little from use but it easily slides out of the ""locked"" position, while other hoods that I take off and on often still have a nice secure fit."
4,Protects my lens!,"The hood does what it's supposed to. It's like hard plastic and it does have a thin felt lining on the inside. It screws onto the bayonet and not the filter ring, which can be damaging, like many generic hoods do.I'm not particularly happy with the price, but for the notoriously delicate (and expensive) 50mm f/1.4, I think I'd pay more for the authentic Canon hood to ensure protection.I still think hood should come with your lenses for the 50mm f/1.4 at the very least!"
3,great product that was made for $2,"The lens hood is exactly as described and works well. It's a 5 out of 5 for functionality. It protects my lens and also reduces incident light. It does exactly what a piece of plastic around my lens should.That said, I also have to rate products considering what the price should be. Was it complicated to make? Are the materials expensive? For something that cost a couple dollars to make, I don't think it should be selling for (the low low price of) fifteen times that. So, Canon gets a 0 out of 5 stars for that. So, I rate this a 2.5 stars out of 5 overall. If I had to do it over, I'd probably go to an auction site and buy a generic brand hood for 1/3 of the price.update: i recently bought a generic hood for my canon 10-22mm and it feels as good as the canon hoods (less than 1/3rd the cost). i'll be buying generic from now on. enough with the canon hood price gouging."
3,Very Good Lens Hood,"This lens hood was purchased for Canon 50mm 1.4 lens.It is good and performs as designed. Highly recommended.No complaints other than Canon should include lens hoodswith all lenses, should not have to purchase separately andPricey for plastic is why only 3 stars."
4,Best office printer by far,"Our old reliable Oki Data printer finally gave up the ghost, so the natural reaction was to get another one. We are on our forth one in 10 years, and they are totally ""abused"" in our office. This one, so far, has lived up to it's predecessors reputation, and unless this one proves otherwise, we'll definitely keep on getting these machines."
1,Sucky Tallow Pot,The pot I ordered did not correspond to the item shown. In addition the pot I received was of poor fit and finish. The paint job in particular was extra sucky.
5,WOW!,"Outstanding book on retirement. I've read many books on this subject and this is undoubtedly the best. You don't need any other books if you have this one.My advice is to buy it, read it more than once, and keep it as a lifelong reference!"
4,A neat water toy,"I really liked this toy! The radio can play your favorite FM stations (although it isn't the clearest.) and along with it, cool sounds! I like the dolphin the best: I love the noise! It sounds real! This is great if you have a pool."
1,a very dissapointed 12 year old,"(I am not a toy enthusiast) If you want to buy this radio, you should deffinatley change your mind. This piece of junk is so quite you can barely hear it three feet away. And the reseption is terrible, you would have to point a radio tower right at it to get decent reception. It really does belong in the toilet. So once again DO NOT BUY THIS POOL RADIO!!"
1,"Bathtub toy, not for pool","I bought this thinking I could use it in the pool. It receives the channels fine, but it's not even audible underwater, not even 4 feet away with the volume blasting. Who ever is giving this five stars is listening to the radio in their bathtub or toilet. It [is not good], don't waste your money, even if it is [$$$]."
1,What crap,What a piece of crap. We didnt even have it in the pool for an hour and it quit working. We tried drying it out but it still wouldnt work. Its ok if you dont use it in the water but its supposed to be made for water use. I wish there was a 0 rating on here because thats the rating I would have givin it. Dont buy this unless you plan on using it OUT of the water only.
1,Another Frisbee,"I purchased this DVD hoping to add two classic comedies to my collection. There is no doubt that the original film versions were hilarious. However, the quality of the video in this particular release is so poor as to make the imagery almost unintelligible. Most of the characters' faces appear as white light within a faint silhouette. The audio is fair if you feel nostalgic for the old radio days. I must confess that I was unable to sit through more than ten minutes of either feature. Surely modern digital enhancement could provide us with a viewable version of these films.I don't know if I'll ever buy another DVD without reading a review first."
5,A wonderful introduction to the art of Kickboxing!,"What a wonderful book. The most appealing thing about it was the author's style of communication. Not only does describe techniques clearly and thoroughly, but I also felt he was right there providing the instructions. His tone was informative and friendly -- he knows his stuff. You will really like Peter, and if you practice what you learn from this book, you will also be on your way to mastering the exciting art of Kickboxing."
4,The second non- Clinton segments asking about the great man of the Century,"I know in the first segment Bill Clinton named Roosevelt as his Man of the Century. A reasonable choice. In the second segment Charlie Rose asks a number of people who their great man was. I first of all thought the choice here of guests asked not the best, and not the most varied. A number named Gandhi and Nelson Mandela. Chris Mathews named the Man of the Century in terms of politics and history, Winston Churchill. I believe Elie Wiesel also mentioned him. Wiesel also mentioned the American soldier. And I believe in the beginning mentioned the person who Time Magazine would name as Man of the Century. It would also be my choice. Einstein. Simply because his accomplishment in understanding fundamental laws regarding the nature of the universe is an accomplishment which is for 'all- time'. I did not particularly enjoy this segment or find the choices interesting or entertaining."
5,Excellent!,I was shocked with how quickly I received my dvds. I was expecting it to take almost a week and I only waited two days.My dvds also arrived in excellent condition. And I've been enjoying them ever since.
2,The first season was so good. What happened?!,"After thoroughly enjoying the first season of ""The Magnificent Seven"", I eagerly proceeded to the second season. However, the second season is nowhere near as fun as the first. The first season episodes were made in the spirit of the good, old-fashioned western, with no deep issues to get in the way of the action. It was the sort of thing that the whole family could enjoy. Yet, for reasons that are entirely beyond me, in the second season, the writers decided to introduce a look of psychological issues: slavery, rape, infidelity, J.D.'s guilt after killing a man... Not to mention the fact that someone working on this series has a major axe to grind against Irish-Catholics. I am not surprised that the show was cancelled after this season. By the time I got to the end of it, I didn't want to watch any more either.This boxed set contains the 13 episodes of season two, packaged in slim-line cases. There are no special features included on the DVDs."
2,Loved their first two albums...,It took forever to track down this long out of print release. I'm sorry to say it wasn't worth it.
1,not worth the money,"I ordered this to prevent further scratching of my pricey GPS unit. When it got in I applied it and was quite disappointed in how dark it makes the screen. I use screen protectors on my iPod, my phone, and other devices and this one is the worst. It might protect the screen, but so does a piece of cardboard, and both offer the same amount of transparency. I ended up buying another product called Ivisishiel that works like a champ and doesn't cut down the brightness."
3,GPS Screen Protector 60csx,"Fair product, only one protector in the package...seems pricey to me. Better to buy a pack from Office Depot or Office Max with 9 more sheets and trim to fit the screen for just a few dollars more..."
5,roll out hampers work very well,"I ordered four hampers in two shipments. the first shipment arrived without problems, but the second shipment had two damaged hampers. woodworkers hardware sent out two new hampers promptly as replacements and they were perfect. i have installed these hampers in my laundry room and use them all the time. they are heavy duty, roll out easily even when fully loaded with clothing. installation was simple with 4 wood screws. can't beat the price from woodworkers hardware - most other places sell it for $40 more."
3,It's a cleaning kit.,"Pretty nice cleaning kit. I use it to clean my Sig P220. Comes with pretty much everything you need. My only issue is with the case. The plastic seems a little flimsy and I usually handle it cautiously to prevent an accidental breakage. But, other than that, it gets the job done with no problems at all. I'd recommend it to a friend."
4,Not as good as the previous books in the series,"I am loving this series, but the books have been uneven. I LOVED the first three books, especially books 1 and 3. I couldn't wait to start book 4, which focuses more on the relationship between Cam and Blair and weaves in a 9/11 plot. I skipped through some of the love scenes between Cam and Blair because I felt I wanted more ""plot"" about the relationship's development and the precursor planning to 9/11. The book felt light on both. At some parts, I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book and thought I would not go on to book 5 and instead would stop reading the series at book 4. But now that I have finished book 4, which got better in the last 1/3 of the book, I am looking forward to book 5. I'm afraid to be disappointed, however, as I can't imagine how much more Radclyffe can squeeze out of these characters. Thus, I approach the next book in the series with some trepidation..."
4,cat's outta the bag,"Blair and Cam are thrust even further into the spotlight at a dangerously inconvenient time when a reporter jumps the gun and outs them in a news story that's released too early.At the same time, terrorist groups plan to coordinate the 9/11 attacks as well as the assassination of the president's daughter. They are successful on one front, but Agent Roberts and company thwart their other plans, at great cost to their security team."
2,Just didn't do anything for me,"This book might have been hot back in 2000 but it hasn't held up well. I've read this book a couple of times and each time I wonder ""Why did I pick this up?"" I've never understood the whole Charlie, Dalton, Harry triangle thing. If Dalton was looking for Charlie that hard surely he would have found her after all that time as the mother didn't change their SS#s or their names. Didn't get that at all. That said, I do think the book does a good job of exploring the character's emotions."
3,blaze - this one?,"okay, the story was good, but this book was definitely not blaze. I like Lori Foster's writing style and the discussion between heros is wonderful, but after Taken or Tantalizing this book was quite a disappointment as Blaze."
4,Manually Extracted,"The sounds seem to be manually extracted from the instruments - or with the help of pencil lead as the sound conductor. Great songs - it's not experimental - its pop, without the dull edge."
4,"Outstanding, Clean & Hilarious","This is a great video, it is wholesome comedy that you can let your children watch without concern of foul language. It is a nice blend of documentary and insight to Jackie's experiences growing up as a child and son of a rabbi, and an interesting path that this mans life has taken, really nice and refreshing to see somebody doing what he ""thought"" was the right thing to do, and finding what his true purpose was an further going after it and getting it done! Way to go Jackie, you are an inspiration to me and I appreciate this well done DVD, blessings!"
1,Review of Jackie Mason Comedy Trilogy DVD disk,I cannot use this disk because after about 5 minutes of playing the picture breaks up into digits. I really would like my money back.
4,Good starting point to understand WCDMA,This book provides a good introduction to 3GPP Release '99 and helps you navigate the standard. The main focus is on the DS-CDMA radio interface. The book is useful for people with a knowledge of GSM wanting to know about WCDMA. If there is any weakness in the book it is the lack of coverage of Services & Applications.
2,umts,"With UMTS you must read what you can get - unfortunately what you can get is not aleays what you want - so with this book. Although the authors seem well informed, they are not god communicators - their explanations are alternatively trivial or incomprehensible, their diagrams, in most cases copied slavishly from the specifications, explain nothing. Perhaps this book is useful as a reference after the subject is comprehended. Comprehension does not lie here."
3,Informative but not lucid,"Its a good book for starters and people getting to know the subject of wcdma and umts. But, the language is very bland and looks more of an ieee paper. Recommended for people who are indireclty associated with umts or similar products."
1,Lots of Misinformation,"While the book is useful for learning UMTS abbreviations the text is full of misinformation regarding data rates, power control, BER and FER. It's worth a read for the abbreviations but don't bank on the math. The authors have obviously never performed in lab or system level design. The premise that the Eb/No decreases as a function of thruput is nonsense. The section on network capacity is nonsense. Read Proakis for a true understanding of coding and modulation."
4,Tech made Easy,This is the review of the book released earlier in 2000. The authors are well versed with the ongoing tech trends as Nokia is the world's leader in developing WCDMA 3G equipments.
5,LIKE TRAVELING THE TRAIL WITH RETTA,"A delightful young heroine and realism on the westward journey. A clean, delightful read for myself, my children, and grandchildren!"
4,The Battle Of Stalingrad,"I only purchased The Battle Of Stalingrad, so no comment can be made about Othello. However, The Battle Of Stalingrad offers some serious music from this great composer, who is generally known by his romping Sabre Dance and other ballet pieces. For those unfamiliar with Khatchaturian's versatility or the full extent of his immense talents, I recommend listening to this suite, which documents the tragic and, eventually, heroic events of this major WWII battle."
2,Luther's Worst,"This is easily Martin Luther's worst book, as he creates a warm and fuzzy atmosphere. To me, that is selling out. Realizing his mistake, he rebounded with his Easter book, a collection of sermons. That's where we get Xmas from is Martin Luther. If the only time they get somethiong new is on Xmas, including clothes, that's why the economy is so bad. Realistically, Xmas is a time to get someone in your family to buy you that thing you want but can't quite afford or is to find, or to encourage kids to be kids by playing with toys."
5,the best diaper rash cream ever,"i tried alot of different things for my baby but nothing beats Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula Diaper Rash cream. very effective at preventing and treating diaper rash, and smells great to boot! Im a big fan of palmers"
3,"Useful format, not-so-objective information","Being somewhat of a ""history buff,"" I initially thought that this book would be a useful addition to my library in order for I or anyone else to quickly find information on a variety of topics relevant to American history. In scope and usability this book is good. However, after actually using the book several times time it became increasingly evident to me that the portrayal of American history in this book is consistently biased, in this instance from a liberal/progressive/apologetic tilt, to the extent of which I believe it to be detrimental to the reader on account of the selectivity of the information included (or especially not). While many historical essays and other writings are not necessarily objective, I do not believe that a general reference book should be written in such a fashion. Needless to say this book is no longer a part of my library."
4,Old style Palmolive,"This is the old, regular density palmolive, which I haven't seen in retail stores in years - not the more recent, more concentrated ultra Palmolive, which gives you the same number of uses from a smaller bottle. From a practical standpoint, though, they both work similarly and have the same advantages and disadvantages.Palmolive's slogan used to be ""softens your hands while you do the dishes"" - and it is much easier on the hands than other dishwashing detergents. It's also plenty strong enough to clean my dishes, and I do a lot of high temperature cooking using plenty of oil and fat. If you're looking for a dishwashing liquid that won't require you to wear gloves while doing the dishes, Palmolive is an excellent choice."
4,Great soapy action for your everyday kitchen needs - gentle on hands as claimed.,We use this or the transparent version for our daily kitchen needs. Great soapy action and cleans effectively whilst being gentle on hands (it's biggest sell). No complaints.
1,Terrible Dish Soap,"This dish soap is quite possibly the worst I have ever used. I've had the misfortune of having to use it at work (a small retail bakery). In comparison with other similarly priced dish soaps, this soap has average or just slightly below-average performance in terms of grease emulsion. The product's poor ability to clean however, becomes a minor concern when compared with it's smell.If you happen to enjoy the smell of the urinal-cakes they put in the mens' room, then you'll be in heaven when you open this bottle of soap, otherwise prepare yourself for the foul odor that is about to come from your sink. Remember too, that no matter how thoroughly you have rinsed a particular dish of this soap, it will somehow cause the dish in question to smell like burned soap next time you are baking with it."
5,great resource for those doing historical research,"Presnell's book is a must have guide for anyone undertaking historical research. The book takes the reader through the research process and how to identify useful sources. In addition, Presnell provides examples of reference sources to help get the reader going. The book is easy to read and well written."
4,Good jumping off point,"The Presnell book is an excellent reference work for aspiring historians; she guides you through not only the mechanics of research but offers a wealth of notes and bibliographic data. The main drawback to The Information-Literate Historian is that the use of artifacts from the historical period as a tool to augment and verify documents is not addressed. In fact, Presnell seems to shy away from ""hard"" data science, such as statistics, in general. I'm thinking that the next edition of this book (and I hope there is one!)covers these missing research areas."
1,WRONG INFORMATION FOR THIS DVD,This DVD is NOT the DVD that people have reviewed here.Jimmy Durante and Donald O'Connor are NOT on this DVD.There is NO feature movie on this DVD.It does contain 4 hour long Colgate Comedy Hour programs from different years in the early fifties that are very funny.
5,One More To Go!,Every Martin and Lewis Diamond DVD is more than welcome to my collection!Keep them coming!
4,The carnage is not based in paranoia but in male biology.,"The description of the urge to kill in the name of God and other ideologies is well chronicled in this book, as is the need to identify an ""evil other."" The authors, however, miss the forest for the well chronicled trees. The violence is rooted more in male biology than paranoid psychology. Male biology needs to form ""teams"" and violently compete with and exterminate each other, and it is extremely inventive in doing so, from football teams to religions."
1,Robins and Post reflect an outdated view from the FAR left!,"James Jesus Angleton: These writers would have you believe that JJA was paranoid and there were no MOLES inside the CIA. The recent revelations about John Arthur Paisley and Aldridge Ames prove that JJA was sane, correct, and on the scent. Paisley?s death is a mystery that no one has yet explained! One of the few people who know the truth about Paisley, Senator Ted Kennedy, is NOT TALKING!J. Edgar Hoover: He was the best counterintelligence director since George Washington's extensive intelligence organization during the Revolutionary War! One of the most interesting facts to emerge is the recent revelation that J. Edgar had an agent at the top levels of the Soviet Government that remained undetected. He deserves a lot of credit and there are a number of us out here that believe that 9/11 may not have happened had the FBI not deteriorated so much from the standards that J. Edgar established."
4,good,the game is really fun the disc two is manly online play story is fun the fixed the camera but the only thing bad about it konmi shut down the servers in the us but still avilable in Europe
5,Great Game,"This game is one of the best games I have ever played. I all the other MG and MGS games, minus Twin Snakes. This game is Snake Eater but improved. The new 3rd person camera look gives you a better look at the screen and a better chance at stealth. Other than that the core game is the same. Then you get the original MSX MG and MG2 Solid Snake games that have never before been released in the USA. Along with that you can rewatch all of your favorite sceens from the game, and new hilarious Special Theatre videos. The duel modes are excellent if you love fighting the bosses over and over again. Next, is the online game. It is extremely fun. You fight real people instead of the artificial intelligence and you never know when you are going to get killed. This game is a must have for anyone who loves stealth games or MGS."
2,think twice,This product can only be used on your ankles or sitting down. I want to wear it while standing and playing my guitar but it just sides down. I am going to try to put elastic on the ends but it still may be too big and I don't know if I can even get it to attach as the ends are very thick. Nice sound though if you are going to sit down or hold in your hand.
5,Fun Parachute,"I bought this for Christmas for my three children ages 4 (twins) and 18 mos. Although the younger child doesn't really get the games we play with it, the older ones do and we all have a great time. My goal was to get them to be active during the winter (less TV time), and this works for about 30 minutes. I only wish we had a bigger house so I could have gotten the bigger parachute. I can't wait to play with it outside when it gets warm."
4,so much fun with soo little.....,There are many of ideas to play with a parachute online. Great for play group and toddler's play dates...!!Is big enough for 6 kids and doesn't have that ugly hole in the middle!!!!
5,Great product for children and playgroups,"We hold a playgroup with small children (1-4 year olds) and use this as part of the activities. It is great for teaching the children to jump, dance, hide, and about colors. You can bounce toys on it, as it is very durable.It is also easy to hold for small children, even one year olds. Overall just what you would want out of a children's play parachute."
3,Too much use of French language descriptions,"An excellant and useful English language historical reference. However, the papers comprising each chapter will spend a page or two building up to a conclusion, and then give a French language phrase to summarize their point. If I could read French well enough to completely understand such intimate little points, I would have no need of an English language text on this period of French history."
1,"Poorly done, what a waste of money","Jack London was a self taught author, like all of the great artist of his time. He experienced the adventures that he wrote about. He practiced what he preached in relations to his socialist stance. He found his love and committed to her and she tolerated his in-maturity and child like adventures. Not any of these facts are brought out in this documentary. Would not recommend this product for anyone who is in search of the true Jack London."
2,"not bad, but not good either","I ordered this thinking Mr. T was going to be fighting, didn't read it closer. I am a huge fan of UFC fighting and have several of their PPV DVD's, so didn't occur to me to read. Anyway this one Mr. T was simply a commontator and was in the locker room. His role was minimal. Fights were short, and not well set up."
5,Nice glove,"The glove is great. Soft right out of the box.It did start to get a little loose after 3 seasons of playing with it and I found that it needs a little bit of leather between the second and third fingers to keep things tighter. After spending time to tighten the glove's top laces, everything is nice and firm again."
4,Good buy worth the $$$.,"Nice glove, broke in easily, good construction and quality for the price, would buy another for in a couple of years when this one is wore out, it is winter now looking forward to the season to use this glove."
1,This is an absolutely awful performance of a wonderful work.,"This is the most inept performance of any work by Brian available on CD. The work itself is a towering masterpiece, but one would never know it from Rowe's performance. Rowe does the impossible: He makes the ""battle scherzo"" which requires 16 horns, 2 pianos, and organ boring! Worse, he makes one of the greatest composers of the 20th century sound incompetent! Having known (and loved) all of the 32 Brian symphonies for many years, I must say that the majority of the performances released on CD are distinctly underplayed. Two exceptions are the very fine Andrew Penny recording of Syms. 20 and 25 and the Bisengaliev performance of the Violin Concerto. This should be absolutely the LAST CD you buy for your Brian collection!"
1,Not true to size,"They are beautiful shoes, but not true to size. I am a ten and I couldn't get them on...they fit my mother, who's an 8 1/2 Very dissappointing."
5,"Wonderful gift for ""Nana's""","My nine-year-old granddaughter is just starting ballet, with the help of me, her long-ago dancer ""Nana."" These Angelina Ballerina books make perfect gifts for her - thank you for making lots of t hem! We got this one first, before her first class, so that she could see some of the ""steps.""Since then I have given her more, and in fact just ordered another one. She always loves them, and so do I. The illustrations are charming, and there is a nice moral in most of them.Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening In God"
5,This book IS a ballet class!,"Great book! I don't know enough to teach my 4 year old ballet, so I narrate for her living room ballet class by reading the book aloud. I love the fact that it shows me how to pronounce the names of various ballet steps. Plus the descriptions of the steps are good enough that I can help her learn some. The flip book is a fun extra, but don't buy the book for that as it is hard for little hands to 'flip' the pages. Use ribbon to tie it together (with knot) so it's safe for younger kids too."
2,Poor design,"This is an adorable book, but I don't know what the publisher was thinking when they attached the casing of ribbons to the front cover. The only way to remove the plastic casing causes a big, circular tear to the cover! I would not have ordered this book had there been any indication that it would come with packaging on the cover. Buy the hardcover!"
1,Be aware the LCD screen is not under warranty,"The sony LCD screen is not under the notebook warranty. The screen is extremely fragile. I bought a S260 for 3 weeks and then found LCD screen had a crack. It turned out the damage on LCD is not under warranty and I had to pay $726 to replace the screen. When you purchase the notebook, consider to pay some extra money to buy LCD insurance might be a good idea."
1,Beware of Booting-up problem,"I bought a Sony Vaio VGN-S260 November 2004 at Amazon.com. The laptop was doing fine for a while and I loved the screen. Thing went bad 1.5 months ago when I started having problem booting up. I have to keep power on and off for 20 minutes each time I need to start my computer.Try google for this problem on the web and you will find that mine is not an isolated occurence (the amount of posting related to this issue is amazing). Apparently, the same problem has existed in previous series of Vaio.I have lost confindence in Sony's product quality (AND after-sale service quality)No more Sony product for me......"
2,BEWARE,"I LOVED my Vaio until 7 months after I purchased it I shut my laptop one evening like I normally do and when I opened it the next morning it had a small crack at the top of the LCD screen. It was surrounded by blue and bright purple lines going down my screen that have only gotten longer and larger. I took back and was told not only is this common (after doing more research I found many others with the same problem) that it was my fault, or as he put it ""customer abuse"". Closing my laptop is abuse?? I spoke with Sony and the technician even said they have gotten other calls about this.They refused to give me a corporate number where I could speak with someone just an address where I could write. They also told me that it would cost me $777.00 to fix, but why fix it if it is going to happen again? One would assume Sony would stand behind their product especially if this is common."
1,Screen cracks easily,"Well I've had this laptop for 3 years. Overall, the fan is loud and it is poorly constructed. Luckily I had purchased a 4 year accidental protection plan that shortly ended in 3 years because of the cost to replace the screen. 2 screen repairs and a couple bad keyboard keys meant that my warranty was fulfilled and buying a 4 year warranty was a stupid idea. It seems any repair whether by defect(3 out of 4) or accidental(1 out of 4) counted towards your accidental warranty work. Because of those 3 manu. defects in workmanship this ended my warranty early which just doesn't sit right with me. Now I have a bad screen that supposedly has a crack that I do not see that and is not covered and they want $762 to fix it. Do not buy this laptop or you will get burned, I guarantee it."
2,Merlin & The War of the Dragons [Blu-ray],I was very disappointed in this movie. It seemed to made for the stage and the cinamatics wrer horrible. Close-up after close-up. I think anyone could have done better with a camcorder and your neighbor nextdoor.
2,Cameraman in the Balcony,"I would like to add to the negative reviews already posted the further comment that I have never yet seen a ballet so consistently photographed from a distance. Wide ensemble shots are often appropriate; but whatever acting and subtler gestural skills the dancers may have exhibited, not to mention costuming details, are almost entirely lost on the viewer. Closeups last for a few seconds at most, as if the filming director were afraid of letting makeup show. This was highly frustrating to me, as both Dowell and Sibley seemed to be in good form. Even in the solos and pas de deux segments the camera hangs awkwardly back as if the cameraman were unfamiliar with the piece and fearful of letting the principals unexpectedly dash off screen. Ballet is a pantomimic art, and a good visual recording should not relegate the viewer to the nosebleed seats."
2,yawn.....,"I've got to say that my daughter and I were both excited for this to arrive in the mail. When it did, neither of us could sit through it. The dancing is alternately made up of the uninspired, the farcical and the same-old. Even the score is insipid. Sorry Prokofiev, but you've done better! If you aren't looking for Cinderella specifically, skip it, there are more interesting ways to spend your time. If you are, pull out old Brother's Grimm--at least that one has grotesque going for it."
2,toy is great mfg. needs to be fired...toy does not work!!!!,Purchased toy for grandson who loves James Brown toy worked one hour and stopped also battery slot was glued shut I payed too much money to have my grandson's christmas miserable....will never buy from this company again.....jv
4,he had a stroke,"My Godfather of Soul has had a stroke about five weeks into his first semester. His mouth stopped moving several seconds into his life with me, but now his right arm dangles, useless at his side. The rest of him is still the hardest working doll in show business."
4,FEELING REAL GOOD.!,"FOR ANY JAMES BROWN LOVER, THIS IS AN EXCELLENT CONVERSION PIECE.EVERYONE WE HAVE SHOWN THIS TOO GOT SUCH A TICKLE AND ASKED WHERE CAN IT BE PURCHASED. OF COURSE I TOLD THEM AMAZON.COMMY FAVORITE JAMES BROWN SONG IS ""FUNKY GOOD TIME"". MAYBE THE MANUFACTURER CAN HAVE THAT SONG ON THE SECOND EDITION. THE PRICE IS ALSO A PLUS."
3,Good for bringing old-timers up to speed.,"A bit too much ""story"" and a bit too little ""meat"", but I suppose that's endemic to the MLM book community.Still, this is a good way for old-style MLMers to be gently made aware that Things Are Different Now and they'd better lose their irrational fear of computers if they want to Network-Market at their optimum.Poe does a good job reminding the reader that E-Everything doesn't replace human relationships as the foundation of MLM--that technology instead is more of a jump-start, lubricant, and market expander--but STILL Poe too often waxes hyperactive about MLM's shiny-new E-Mail/Internet Frontiers.In short, this isn't the Must Read it purports to be, but it does have a place on the right bookshelves."
2,Eh- not as good as the first.,"I was very excited about this book, as ""WAVE 3"" was really good. I feel that if you have read WAVE 3, you pretty much get the whole deal. WAVE 4 doesn't really expand well enough for me to recommend reading it.Although the book needed to be written, to show how Network Marketing has grown, this book just doesn't have the belief and enthusiasm that the first one does."
1,Unhappy Admin Prof Day!,This is the worst. I bought this for my secretaries for Administrative Professionals Day. It jammed and a washer fell out before the end of the first day. What a PIA!!!
2,Terrible,"This book was used in a lit class, and quizzes were assigned after reading. The mean scores after a quiz were around 20%. This book was written in such an obtuse and obfuscating manner, it was impossible to decipher any meaning from much of the book. Some of the simpler criticisms were easier to understand, but it seems the further into the book you go, the worse the description of the criticisms. This book seems to have been written for PhD students and academics, not undergrads."
5,Great book for a radiography student,I am a radiography student and my instructor recommended this book to help me with image analysis on fluoroscopic procedures that I was struggling with. I love this book; it helped me a lot not just with the fluoroscopic images. I will continue to use it as I finish my radiology program.
5,Beyond the Diagnosis of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome,"This book is an extension of the material found in *Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: A Guide for Families and Communities* by Ann Streissguth.Some of the topics: Secondary disabilites that can occur when diagnosis is later in life. ADULT FAS which is an entirely different set of problems and probably the part to which the public and the community are most resistant....this would include diagnosis, independent living and residential treatment situations. Medications for children with FAS. Classroom setups/situations that would aid a child with FAS. Judicial concerns for the person with FAS who has encountered problems with the law. Sexual deviancy. Treatment programs for mothers with addiction issues."
2,An ok book,This book is a compilation of ideas and suggestions from other organizing sources. The book did not give me a broader understanding of how to make nor maintain an organized life. Bits and bites of different things put together.
5,Challenging but just enough..,The sequences are long enough for beginners and the poses give you a lot to strive for in terms of form. Instruction is clear and not overly earthy-crunchy. Works your whole body in a short time.
2,knowing nothing of yoga.....,"Knowing nothing of Yoga I thought this DVD would be good because of the beginer status, however I found it very difficult. Explanations of moves are not done in enough detail. The first series starts out with difficult moves (at least I thought so) and with neck/shoulder problems it was even more extreme.I would only reccomend this for those people who have had at least some yoga experience/training."
3,Yoga Sculpting for INTERMEDIATES!,"This video is NOT for beginners! I think intermediates would get more out of this video. I enjoyed the Jamaican scenery-very sunny, beautiful and serene. But, the first time I tried Yoga Sculpting, it was very stressful on my wrists. Since I do like the fact that the video is split into two 20-minute segments, I'm going to reserve this video for later use."
1,TOO LAME FOR ME,"This movie was kind of lame. When I started to watch it I thought how silly it looked, but I still tired it. I only tried the sessions a few times before re-selling this DVD. It is for beginners (that would be me), but it just wasn’t a good fit for me. I pass as it was boring and cheesy. Didn’t care much for the host either."
1,TOO ADVANCED,"The yoga instructor rushed through a series of movements. As a beginner, I have a hard time catching up. I am disappointed because I actually enjoyed the Introduction to Yoga by Yoga Zone."
1,Annoying,"I really hated this DVD. The production quality is poor, the music is too fast, the instructor races through the poses. The poses are not really suitable for beginners. The instructor's voice was annoying, too."
1,Not this one!,"I usually LOVE all Yoga Zone videos, but this one is not the same quality! The instructor is hard to understand, the camera views are off, and it's way-too unrealistic! It says for beginners and up, but this is clearly a way-advanced tape. I threw my back out with this one! Try again Yoga Zone!"
3,Yoga Zone,"I bought this dvd to relieve stress and tone. It's too easy for me but I like Yoga Zone so I am going to buy more of an advanced one from them. If you've ever done pilates or yoga in the gym or before, get an advanced one."
3,NOT for beginners,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would be a good tape for my first venture into Yoga. NOT SO! I could not even begin to follow along with what they were doing. My wife, who has been doing Yoga for several years, described it as intermediate to somewhat advanced at best. There was no introduction to breathing, pacing, placement of hands, arms, legs, etc. which I assume to be an intregal part of Yoga. I would recommend this tape ONLY to more advanced Yoga practicioners."
4,WHY??????????,"In this story Donna Hill attempts to answer the question why and how did this betrayal happen in this book. I was really into the book and trying to feel what happened, but I really thought about it and hell no could I ever forgive my best friend for so many years if she slept with my husband. Call me unforgiving and mean and even hateful. I am just keeping it real and showing you reality. I didn't like the ending but then again Donna Hill kept it real. Donna you did a great job at making a sister think about some real issues."
5,Certainly No Ordinary Book!,"Well if you're not a Donna Hill fan prior to this spectacular novel, you're sure to be after. Ms. Hill draws in readers with the very first page...and doesn't let go until the conclusion. She pulls you into the lives of the three main characters...and makes you sympathize with all three. Even when the adultery takes place--it's difficult to find a villain in this tale. What you are faced with are just three ordinary people--with very human-like flaws.This is a powerfully written tale--of love, friendship, betrayal, and love lost. In addition to being beautifully written, it is very realistic in the sense that in life there are often unhappy endings.I've read three or four of Ms. Hill's novels..and thus far, this is without a doubt my favorite.Buy the book!"
5,Life changing decisions,"One of the most unforgiving acts in the world is betrayal of a best friend.""Ordinary Woman"" deliveries the story of childhood friends Lisa and Asha. Lisa is the good girl from a two parent house hold who has a controlling personality. Asha is free spirit and spontaneous and has a troubled relationship with her mother.After the vows life isn't as perfect as Lisa would like and she forces Ross to re-think the whole marriage thing. Asha, on the hand is dealing with self doubt. One thing leads to another and before you know it everything is turned up side down. Lives are changed forever.The novel grabbed my attention in the beginning and kept me capativated until the end. The characters were well developed and I felt the highs and lows of each one. Excellent story about friendship, marriage and adultry. This is one that shouldn't be missed. Hats off to Donna."
3,I bought it!,"This is nothing more than a repeat of a compilation of the three DVD's previously released featuring Rathbone and Bruce. They are:Dressed to KillThe Woman in GreenTerror by NightIf you already got them, don't buy this!Caveat emptor! (let the buyer beware)"
1,I'd give this a zero if it were possible,"Don't get me wrong, Basil Rathbone is definitely one of the best Sherlock Holmes ever. The take on A. Conan Doyle's work on these films are great. We can't expect the sound or picture to be of superb quality since these are lifted from very old probably brittle films and it's priced quite low. So low as to be so tempting even to the casual buyer... and the DVD does not run at all. We've asked amazon to replace or refund us for this dozens of times with no result. So we just imagine the contents based on the TV reruns we saw as kids. The DVD is defective, doe snot work at all. And Vintage Home Entertainment does not have a website or contact email, so forget it, you'll be stuck with a defective DVD and kiss your $7+shipping goodbye."
5,Breeze to setup,"I bought this printer for it's networking ability and it was an absolute pleasure to setup. I'm running W764, Vista64, W7 Home Premium 32 and XP on my home network. All three installed without any problems in a matter of minutes. I will say I did check OKI's web for the current drivers and used those instead of the CD that came with printer.For what it's worth, I purchased a Lexmark E120N first and returned it after I couldn't get it to function on the network. No idea what the problem was, but I put too much time into it, so decided to dump it for the OKI.Highly recommended."
4,Good,"Pros:The best ingredient list per serving size out there, they really pack all the goodies in here.Tastes great!(Do yourself a favor and mix with some skim & ice in a blender. Despite what they say, it will clump in a shaker bottle if you use anywhere near the recommended amount).Cons:Unlike Muscle Milk (not hyping it, it's by the same company), CytoGainer doesn't sit well with me on an empty stomach. It's weird, since I thought a gainer like this could be substituted once and a while for breakfast when I'm in a hurry. It has a sort of ""hollow"" feel to it though, so be sure to eat first, at least in the morning anyway."
4,Best dollar value out there for feeding your muscles,"I'm far from a supplement expert, but from what I've read Cyto Gainer gets good reviews especially for the price. I started using Cyto Gainer two weeks ago and I've gained 5 good pounds. That's 5 pounds without changing my workouts or my diet. I just added a half shake in the morning and a half shake at night. The best part is that I don't feel bloated or gassy like with other powders I've tried. Just be warned that the mint taste is very strong. Not a bad thing, but it does feel like I just finished chewing gum when I finish a shake. I've switched over to strawberry to see if I like that better."
2,"Probably a great product, can't stomach this Flavor","As far as the ingredients go, it is a great value for what you get. I accidentally ordered the Chocolate Mint flavor, I thought it said Chocolate Malt. I used 8 scoops anyone wanna buy the rest for $20 I don't think I can drink the rest of this tub without puking."
4,Chocolate mint,"Cytogainer is the best in its class. Usually has all the best flavors and shows the best results. I've already put on 3# (bought it a month ago). This flavor tastes like those little chocolate mints you get from restraunts, dont know if i'd purchase the flavor again. Chocolate malt and vanialla are amazing"
4,Beautiful ring,"This is a great ring! The only issue is that I ordered a 6 because they didn't have a 5.5 in stock but I just wear it on a different finger than I wanted. It is a great price, the ring looks much more expensive than it is. So far I have worn the ring everyday for a week and have had no issues with it. If you like amethyst this ring is right up your alley! It looks exactly like the picture on here too!"
4,great ring,"love the ring looks as photo but the lighting on the pic makes it look like the more colors in the stones they are a clean lighter stone but all and all a great lighter amethyst stone for the price I was happy.Just a note for you I got the 6 so that I could uses it in the middle finger my wedding band is a 4.5 and I have tiny hands I like the look of a big ring and for me in the middle it is a great size. shipped fast, and I am in Alaska!"
5,"gentle, low-key stories about the Jewish holidays","I love the way these stories are gentle, but not so conflict-free as to be boring. They manage to convey a lot of information about the holidays, too, in a fun, low-key way. The illustrations couldn't be more charming. Best of all, children actually like them! I read ""Beni's New Year"" to a group of 5-7-year-olds this weekend, and they all SAT STILL and LISTENED, believe it or not, asking me to stop only so they could see the pictures."
4,pretty good for the price,"I've used mine when we were staying in a motel -- plugged in and it worked well. When I have used it with it's battery, it has had some problems with freezing up. but worth the price overall."
2,Broke After 2 Years of Light Usage,"We purchased this DVD player for our son to use when we travel. It worked fine for about 2 years and just suddenly stopped reading discs. It has not been mistreated or used excessively, so there is no explanation for the malfunction. We will either repair it (if cost-effective) or, more likely, look for something else that will last a reasonable amount of time."
1,I Bought Two - and they BOTH came with dead batteries,"Purchased two in August 2005. The manufacture date label reads Feb 2005, so they're reasonably new. The batteries won't take a charge. Both are dead as doornails right out of the box. This jibes with my (after the fact) product research that shows common battery failures. I bought them on impulse, on sale, at a big-box retailer At Which I Aim to shop a lot. I will be returning them next trip there."
1,"Bought, Returned, Bought, Returned-Garbage",Let me be brief. I bought this unti 2X because of price and both units froze up and broke within a month. It became fuzzy and grey as well as made a buzzing noise. Units were History. I will never buy an audiovox system again.
3,Trouble with Reading Instructions etc,"Today I received this COBY portable DVD player. It is probably a good player of dvds; however I will never know; the INSTRUCTIONS Manual and all other material is printed in TINY PRINT. I cannot read the instructions to set up the player. [Like almost every other material sent out today the tiny size for printing is everywhere.] I expect I will have to return the dvd player because of this cheap printing system. YES, a small booklet is so much cheaper than a normal sized booklet! [The printing is around 4-point instead of the much larger 12-point normally printed.]"
2,Not for novelists!,"Careful. The examples in this book are from freelancer writers writing for magazines and reviews. None of them is for novelists. The book does NOT include query letters to agents or for book publications.Moreover, the kindle version is so badly done and full of formatting mistakes that it is impossible to read without groaning loudly."
3,"Review of ""Query Letters that worked"" by angela Hoy","The book is excellent for those who want to send query letters about ARTICLES to be published in magazines, but is lacking with respect to authors of BOOKS.I suggest that a more restrictive title, such as ""Query letters that worked for articles publishing"" would prevent buyers who want to focus on publishing books from buying the subject title."
4,Unexpectedly Amusing,"Drawing a Blank by Daniel Ehrenhaft is a surprisingly enjoyable read. The main character, Carlton Dunne the IV, is an introverted graphic artist. Carlton has drawn forever as a way to escape the world around him. His eccentric father, Carlton Dunne the III, is obsessed with a legendary family fued that dates back to 13th century Scotland. This fast-paced read combines all the elements of a good book. The intriguing mystery surrounding his father's kidnapping, the fictional fued whose proof of existance appears in unexpected places, and Carlton's psychotic but fun partner makes this book all that more delightful. The comics dispersed throughout this book add more pleasure and wit to this novel than the text alone. The humor, intrigue, and charm of this novel will enchant readers from the first page to the final picture, anyone will enjoy Drawing a Blank."
4,Drago delivers in Sci-Fighters,"""Sci-Fighters"" provides plenty of action with Billy Drago (The Untouchables) giving one of his best ""creepy"" performances. Co-star Roddy Piper (They Live) is at his best as a detective hunting down a virus-infected alien mutant (Drago). Though low-budget, it is fast moving, has a good storyline and good special effects. And Mr.Drago, giving his character an obsessive, psychotic-style behavior combined with an alien deformity, gives you the creeps. Jane Heitmeyer (Earth:Final Conflict) plays the doctor trying to stop the virus and end's up finding herself pursued by the alien. This is a must have for all fans of Mr. Drago and lovers of sci-fi."
2,Roddy on prozac.....,"This movie has some interesting technology in it (the little Pippin is probably the coolest) but the story line is pretty weak. You will be left with more questions than answers when the credits start rolling.Instead of focusing on the virus, which is what this movie is really about, story development focuses on a sort of warped love triangle which the movie would have been much better with out.Also, the performace by Roddy is very sedated and comes across as unnatural and stiff. He's not the best actor so at least when he's animated like in They Live or Jungleground he makes things interesting and entertaining.The quality of the sound and video of this DVD is good."
2,Installation,"I purchased Wave 6 heater,heater cover and leg stands .Leg stands are nor drilled correctly to match up with with holes in heater base."
3,Black wave heater legs,Works OK seems a little weak for holding up the stove. Bt we put it in a secure place and hope it won't fall over.
1,Heater legs,"The legs had been repackaged, they didn't fit as is. I drilled new holes and made it fit! This was easier than trying to send it back!"
2,Camco universal leg stands,"These Cameco leg stands 57701 are a univeral fit for Wave Catalitic 3, 4 or 6. The Cameco company sells one for each series so these fit but were larger than they needed to be. Buyer Beware!"
3,Meh...,"I'm not a DJ, which is what I've gathered this box is directed towards, however I decided to give it a try, based on the price and previous reviews.My reason for purchasing this was because I was unhappy with the treble that my normal TV/stereo speakers were putting out. I was planning on making these B speakers and then enabling A and B on my receiver. I could tell from the get-go that this wasn't going to work out the way I planned. They just didn't produce the crisp sound I was looking for. But, from a DJ point of view, I can't say how nice these are, so I have to give it 3 stars instead of 2 or 1. I dunno... when cranked, they may sound great. At the very least, I purchased a box that I can install other tweeters in."
2,poor quality,"poor quality product, well it cost me only $21 dollars not so much to expect from this cheap item,but the problem is if you don't want to keep the item,and want to return it, it will cost you $17 dollars for shipping ,because the seller does not offer return labels in case you are not satisfied with the product and want it to return it,i will never buy anything else from these seller again!!!!!"
1,BAD,The sound quality is HORRIBLE but great price for something that has NO bassDO NOT BUY I WOULD RATE THIS A 0 BUT IT DOESNT EXIST
1,une de plus....,"Voilà une compile de plus sur Gloria Gaynor et malheureusement c'est de loin pas la meilleure. Les soit-disant 4 remixes sont plus que nul et le mégamix, on se demande si c'est un gamin de 4 ans qui l'a fait. Bref ne mérite vraiement pas qu'on s'y attarde et notre Reine du Disco ne méritait pas a."
2,booooooring,"mount sims' first album was great. electro-trash with a definite dirrty party prince-y vibe. this is boring. i don't know if it is intentionally underproduced or what, but it's pretty lame. sounds like it was hastily recorded, and has no fun ""how we do"", or ""black sunglasses"" type songs. this along with disappopinting releases from miss kittin and felix da housecat are definitely not helping the already-gasping-for-air electro scene. sad."
1,Truely Dissapointed,"Im sorry but this CD SUCKS!!! The other 5 reviewers must be high or work for his record company.Mount Sims first CD ""Ultra Sex"" is a synthpop classic. Im not sure why he called the follow up ""Wild Light"" There is nothing wild or light about it. Its boring and dark. The only reason I gave this 1 star is becasue there was no option for 0 stars. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. Pick up Ultra Sex instead."
2,Disappointed,"Buy Ultra Sex and be you will be very happy. This album was a major disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong, I am still a Mount Sims fan! I'm just not sure what the agenda was for Wild Light. There isn't one track on the album that could justify my holding onto this CD. I had to sell it to a used Record shop. KEEP AWAY FANS OF ELECTRO! This album is NOT enjoyable.If you are looking to discover great Electro albums, look into Ladytrons Light and Magic, Fischerspooners Odyssey, Felix da Housecat's Devin Dazzle and the Neon Fever, Adult's Resuscitation, Goldenboy's OR, Mount Sims' Ultra Sex, or even Goldfrapps sophomore release Black Cherry has a somewhat Electro feel."
2,The early fifth century is not 'Ancient Egypt',"This novel should more accurately be subtitled 'A Novel of Roman Egypt.' One might generously suppose that this was a marketing scheme, beyond Mr Trent's control, if not for the general pococurantism of the work. This glaring error exemplifies the sense of overall carelessness in research and detail. If one desires a light read, this novel may be an appropriate choice; however, any reader with or desiring knowledge of this remarkable women, her genius and her environs should try Dr Michael Deakin's 'Hypatia of Alexandria.'"
4,Great story,"I do not know who said that history does not repeat itself but has a tendancy to echo, nevertheless I think it could apply to the fundamental lesson contained in this historical novel. I did think I was getting a history book rather than a novel so I deducted one star. I am a star scrooge. I will be recommending this novel to people, nice one Brian."
2,Just couldn't get into this one,"I got to about page 70 before giving up on this one. I just couldn't get into the characters, partly because -- for me -- there was too much ""romance"" and too little history. Or perhaps it was merely a case of wrong expectations. I assumed, from the title that it was set in ancient Eqypt while in fact it takes place in 414 A.D., a period in which I have little interest. I should have realized that, but I have to admit I was unfamiliar with the history of the Great Library of Alexandria or Hypatia herself.I do applaud the author for tackling such a challenging topic and for obviously wanting to shed light on this incredible woman."
2,Forgettable,"I've only read half the book, and don't plan to read the rest. While the subject is certainly worthwhile, the execution is, in my opinion, poor. Mr. Trent's writing isn't particularly good. The characters are broad caricatures, to the extent that St.-to-be Cyril becomes a comic villain. I could picture him twirling a Snidley Whiplash-style moustache while scheming against the non-Christians. There also seems to be an obsession with sex on the part of many of the characters (whether for or against it). I won't speculate on whether this reflects the author's state of mind, or whether he somehow felt it was integral to the story. I would expect that a scholarly biography of Hypatia's life would be a much more satisfying read. If it's done nothing else positive, this book has at least made me curious about the history of the Library of Alexandria, and the librarians and other scholars who studied there."
4,Nice introduction,"If you really want to learn MIDI, as with a lot of communications standards, the only way in which you can be *absolutely* sure you take everything under your belt is to read the original standard - but books like this are far more digestible and this one particularly is not bad. The approach taken here is the big floppy book sort of thing, with a lot of diagrams, all simple and intuitive, and usually presented accurately.The book is not too heavy on the electronic side, but does go into some detail on issues such as sample downloading and SMPTE codes, which would not be essential for a lot of people, but you can bet you will eventually need to cover this stuff if you get serious.Nowadays, this book is likely to be a very little bit out of date, but it is a good addition to your collection if you like things explained really well - and the overlap between this and other somewhat less accessible books would be likely to help a good deal to clarify matters."
4,Putting a face on grace by Richard Blackaby,We are doing it as a study in our mother's group. So far the book is good.
2,many discussions are not true,"This book contains some truth, but much of it is wrong. One ""proof"" of the observation that women's skirt lengths are correlated with the business cycle being wrong is given as women in the financial sector wear pants.Another doozy is the intentional misunderstanding of the maxim that you should heed advice of successful investors. The author says that skilled business students are not wealthy while in school and still may have good market observations.Other proofs involve taking time periods much longer than that for which the rule of thumb is intended for."
2,Llike simple and short articles rather than a book,Not a good work. The 85 axims seems like simple and short articles in any magazine. It is not a book in the classical meaning much more collection of simple thoughts not too interesting.
1,"Please DON""T waste your money or time.",This book is the WORST book in this genre. I was so mad that I had creased the spine or I would have taken it back for a refund. Or better demanded Ms. Lackey send be 5 dollars for my time.Horrible. I don't understand all the 5 star reviews. What book did they read? Not this one that's for sure. The main character whines throughout the book like some awful emo song. Repeating the same complaints over and over again. And for a powerful mage he sure cries a lot. It is just a really bad book.
2,"Feels like a theatric script about gay love, not a fantasy book","This review covers all 3 books of the series.Overall I was bored and disappointed.To me the book has failed as fantasy - the world is too discrete on all levels - you only see the spot-lite of events and magic around main character most of the time without proper explanations or logical connections.The story is too jumpy, you loose important events in the characters life on day, month and years scale now and then.The language is unnatural, only good for acting on stage.Plot is simple and straight - main hero gets super powers and super friends (all granted) and goes to beat one evil nameless mage after another.So to sum up - you get three tomes of a gay love story and family relationships story. If you into that kind of stuff the book might be for you, otherwise stay away."
1,Awful writing about awful characters,"This was my first Mercedes Lackey fantasy novel and it will definitely be my last! From the first page, I found her writing style sorely lacking and I wanted to slap the heck out of Vanyel, who came across as a self-absorbed, rich-boy brat. The ""turning to ice"" device was poorly executed and extremely annoying...almost as hard to take as the homosexual storyline that had the characters professing their undying love for one another within 5-seconds flat. About the time Vanyel began whining about being jealous of his lover's ""Companion"", I found that I just couldn't take it any more and gave up on the book altogether. If there were any genuinely LIKABLE characters in the story, I certainly didn't meet them! It usually takes a lot to make me stop reading a book in mid-stream, but in this case I couldn't wait to relegate this tripe to where it belongs... the trash bin!"
1,This book was lame,"First of all, this book put such emphasis upon this homosexual character and they tried pass off his tendencies as an inborn thing when the author clearly contradicted themselves by showing that it was a result of his father trying too hard to push women on him when he just wasn't ready. Even if you got past this (which I managed to do), there was this ""romance"" that was so shallow and so senseless that it only merited as a plot device. After his power is all opened up, the most that he knows how to do is use these energy channels while his enemy uses lightning spells and he manages to defeat this enemy with a spell that he has never even used before. Very predictable and unrealistic (even for a fantasy)."
1,A warning before you read this book.,"Beware of the other reviews for this book, I listened them and wasted my money. This book is plodding and completely uninteresting. How anyone can make it through this series with all the other great fantasy books out there is beyond me. And what finally turned me off completely from this book and series is that the main character, a teenage boy, has a lover who is also a teenage boy. So unless you don't mind reading about two teenage boy lovers and you don't like for your books actually be interesting, DO NOT waste your money like I did."
1,Feel Good Claptrap,The glorification of the homosexuality in this book was repugnant. The book quickly stopped being a book of high fantasy and became some sort of Larry Flynt meets Danielle Steel. Bad news unless you are after smut reading.
5,Hearthundering appeal!,"A book of many ""1st's."" Mercedes Lackey has become one of my favorite people in the world for bringing us such an amazing account of requited love. Her writing is confident in our ability to live in the world and discover the nuances of it in a tale. This introduction to this authors unique explorations of a world where the intelligent of other species is proven and relied upon is a wonder to read. It has been my vast pleasure to read this author over the years and I have never forgotten the hearthundering appeal of this first book."
5,Awesome!,"There is just no other way to describe it. I usually do not get emotional with a book, but this one did it to me. I loved this book the moment I started. The characters just pull at your heartstrings, make you laugh, make you think, and so on. This is a must read book."
5,Magic's Pawn,"I have read (and bought) nearly every one of Lackey's Valdemar books, but this one (and the other two with Vanyel) are my very favorites. The storyline and the emotional charge just grab you and you become very attached. You will find yourself wanting to re-read this book and the next 2 over and over."
5,This's the best book I've ever read.,"This's the best fantasy book I've ever read. Misty managed to juggle between romance & magics better than most of the other books I've read. Even though I've never like books on romance, but this's the book that got me hooked to Misty's books. This book's a must-read for all, no matter your age or sex."
5,It hooked me!,While not the first Valdemar book I read this was the one that truly got me hooked. I bought this book to read on a trip and I couldn't put it down. I truely fell in love with all the characters. It was as if I was actually there with Vanyel the whole time. I have read this book and the other two in the trilogy 12 times and I plan on reading them more. This book more than any other influence was the reason I developed my Non-prejudicial attitude.
5,The BEST of Mercedes Lackey's books I have read yet.,"This is the best book of the entire series, in my opinion. It grabbed me right from the beginning and I honestly could not put it down (I stayed up all night reading it). The characters were wonderful, the setting was superb, and the story was just out and out great."
4,Magic's Pawn is one of the Best,"This is one of my favorite Mercedes Lackey books. In it we meet Vanyel, a young boy who does not fit in with the others in his father's keep. Van is sent in disgrace to Haven to the care of his aunt who is a Herald. Once there he meets Tylendel and become friends with the other boy. When Tylendel's twin brother is kill he gets Van to agree to help him kill his brother's murder. What Van doesn't know is that Tylendel is quite mad and kills himself afterward. The Heralds blame Vanyel for his friend's death so he runs off into the night and manages to almost kill himself and he gets Chosen as well.That's all I'm going to tell you of the story.Magic's Pawn is a somewhat dark story and it deals with issues that most people do not think about. It is a good story and one that I recomend to anyone who wants a great fantasy read."
2,I threw it away. I'd rather buy something well written.,"The basic plot is decent enough. But my god, the execution is absolutely hideous.The prose itself is rather poor.I apologize. I cannot back this up with a quote from the book, because I really did throw it away. Take my word that it's not well written, and that I don't simply throw away books for fun.A far worse sin than poor writing, the plot was not well executed. The biggest issue is character development; each character has such exaggerated personality traits as to make them one dimensional. They're simply big, walking stereotypes. And that's really a shame.Quality is at the level I'd expect from a bad, trashy romance novel. Of course, quite a few people LIKE bad, trashy romance novels. If that's your kind of thing, have fun. Myself, I couldn't stand it."
1,Picked it up because of the good reviews...,"I honestly don't know how it got so many five-star reviews.I somehow refrained from throwing it across the room until I had finished it completely. I found the writing style to be juvenile. I might have considered it a good first try for a budding novelist if they were still in junior high.The author used italics in nearly every paragraph for emphasis. This got annoying VERY quickly. The main character is raven-haired and silver-eyed... but at least he's only a Sue in appearance. He can't do anything right, or well, and the story is cover-to-cover angst (okay, so there was a chapter of fluffy twu wuv, which was almost as bad as the angst).The story had a lot of potential, and I really wanted to like it, but it just never got any good."
3,"Good book, shame about...","Good book -- but the cover is truly horrible! It frightened me so much that I had to place my copy face-down, in between readings. Ugh. (The three stars aren't due to the cover, but because Lackey's style needed a bit work in a few places.)Fast-paced and involving, with strong sympathetic main characters. And good horses, too."
2,"Great potential, but it didn't seem to reach it.","The book's characters are as fascinating as they are endearing, and the world which the story is set in is similarly well done. Unfortunately, I didn't have much of an opportunity to appreciate the author's creativity because much of the story was rushed. Instead of taking her time to develop some anticipation, Lackey throws plot climaxes at you mere moments after they are introduced. Many of the events in the story were too abrupt for my liking, and I often found myself wondering if I had accidentally skipped a dozen or so pages in my reading. This quality makes for a decent light read, but I think it has ultimately compromised the development of the characters. If Lackey had not been so hurried and taken a bit more time in establishing the romances, plots, and intrigues, then the book would have much more depth and substance to it. The book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't inspiring either. I'm not sure if I want to read the next one."
5,"WONDERFUL! I've read all her books, all good as gold!","I love her books, I can't put them down! I think she should wright alot more. I cant say enough, they've enspired me to wright a little also."
5,An Absolutely Wonderful Story,"I'm reader new to the world of fantasy, and Mercedes Lackey's books pulled me in. When I got Magic's Pawn, I couldn't put it down. I have never read anything better. Seriously. If you haven't read Magic's Pawn, read it, and the other Misty books. You're missing out. Plus, reading these books helped me realize that shaych (gay) people are people, too, and now I'm very tolerant. If only everyone else could read this and feel so at ease with Van and other shaych people. I admire Van and Stef/Tylendel as good people more than most heterosexuals. Just read them, if you don't understand now. Vanyel's Price was worth it if we can get through to everyone."
5,Amazing journey,"When I first read this book it took me a few chapters to get into it but once I fell into the spell of this amazing book I was hooked. I laughed, I cired, and so much more. I have never been pulled into a book so completly as I was this one. The whole series is just increddible!!! I have read this book many times and my favorite character is savil."
3,best when young,"This book, like ""Catcher In the Rye"" is best read when you're a teenager. Otherwise the pitch of emotion might be a little hard to take.The story is about a young man who, due to his ""unmanliness"" is sent by his father to foster with aunt, who is a Herald (a kind of magic fighter). He falls in love with another young man, and the rest of the book is how he recovers from the loss of his first love.I, too, found the use of an ""ice dream"" clumsy, the kind of thing you would learn in Symbolism 101. But if you're the right age and in the right mood, this book is quite readable and enjoyable."
2,Horribly self indulgent book,"The first few chapters of this book was actually quite promising, which was why I bought the book in the first place. However the book very quickly becomes exceedingly preachy and unbearably romantic. The interactions between the two lead characters seemed very illogical and unrealistic.When writing about the relationship between Vanyel and Tylendel, the author thens to over do it, and lay on the romance, or hurt or whichever emotion- too thickly.Tedious."
4,The first book that ever made me cry...,"This was the first book I ever read by Misty Lackey. It was the first book that ever made me cry. I liked it because Misty made the characters seemed so real...as if Vanyel and Tylendel and the formidable Aunt Savil were people I could actually reach out and touch. In some way they all became very special to me. Now that I have read many of her other books I cannot say that this is the best, but I can honestly say that I have never read another book like it."
1,"Awful, waste of money","To begin with this entire video is only 29 minutes long! As material on the tenor banjo can be hard find i got this and the only other one listed. Most Mel Bay videos are pretty simplistic, but this sets a new low. The only strum he shows is brushing your thumb, along with a few very basic chords (which you can find free off the web). There is nothing beyond that and nothing on the chord-melody technique that makes the tenor banjo style. Most of the time is filled by what looks like rest of his family thumb-strumming along on ukuleles to such hot hits as ""long long ago"" while he thumb-strums a guitar (yes, a guitar, which last time i checked was not a banjo). An incredibly lame excuse for a teaching video and in no way worth the price. The only other video i've found, by bud wachter on homespun, is excellent (see my other review). Unfortunately i opened this first, so don't repeat my mistake and Save your money !"
4,Quick words,"Game ""Lego Island"" by Mindscape, 1997, original does come with a configuration program before the game loads so that it does, in fact, run with Windows XP. Ages 6-12, but 4 year old kids that know how to use a mouse and a joystick have been seen using both (i.e., racing buy walking lego-people while clicking on their heads with the mose to turn their hats into flowers and race car helmets.) You visit rooms to bulid pre-set vehicles that kids have to cycle through parts shelves and drag on to the correct place. Legos can be colored, should is snappy, and my only beef is that there is no give in the movement. You go too far to one side of the road and your car just stops, no chance to travel onto the grass or the water. Ramps and inclindes snap the screen back in place very quickly. Good struts, or old game. There is enough to explore to give kids about a week of play now a days, but if they can read and are interested there is a lot of hidden easter eggs that will keep them busy."
3,Kinda boring,"I agree with some of the reviewers on here: this game is BORING. All you do is walk around the island doing pointless stuff that doesn't help you get farther in the game. And there are annoying lego people who keep getting in your way, talking to you and dismantling themselves. There is a bug(at least with us): When you build a vehicle, you have to click in the EXACT right spot to pick up a piece. And the dumb annoying lego guy ALWAYS gets in your way when you're trying to click on the right spot.To ""win"" the game, you have to on purpose set the Brickster loose, than catch him again, then everyone calls you a ""hero"". There are no challenging things to do. What a pointless idea.The graphics are okay, but there was this on time when the street was colored like the ocean and the grass was colored like the street. Lego Island 2 is MUCH better."
2,Lego Island,"The controls of this game are suspect at best. To click on an object you must find one specific spot on the item, which isn't very large, and is very difficult to find. Extremely frustrating for adults as well as children."
3,Boring Game,"This game is pretty fun at first, but it gets old very fast. You are called to do a certain task around the island, which is cool, until you get through the tasks and do the same ones over and over again. The only part I thought was real good about this game was the exciting car race. But compared to the other Lego PC games, this is quite boring."
3,Quite Easy,"It is one of the funnest games I have but,the only hard thing is to defeat Brickster.I talked to my friend and asked him""What do you do after you defeat the Brickster?""He said start a new game.So that's what I did.I did the same task over and over again.It's fun for kids ages 5-8,but what do teens do?If your above 8 years old.Don't put this on your birthday list."
2,"Nice to look at, but...","I just bought this mirror last night at Target and already I'm thinking of returning it. The ""Perfect"" touch feature would be nice if the mirror weren't so sensitive to touch. If you nudge ANY part of the mirror itself, the pole, or the base, the mirror turns on (or off). If you bump into the table it's on or blow on it, the mirror turns on or off! Can you image how frustrating that is when trying to apply makeup up close and your fingernail shuts the light off? The nicest feature is the 3-way setting, but I'm looking for something a little more practical, like with a manual ON/OFF switch."
2,Good mirror- stupid lighting system!,"Nice mirror height and magnification- but the tiniest touch as you apply makeup turns the light off! Not only that, but the lighting is so poor, you could never use it to apply makeup at night! Honestly, the lighting is of almost no use on this mirror. This mirror will only be satisfying to someone intending to use it in a well lighted area in the daytime(on a desk in a room with good window light)."
1,"good mirror, useless light source","Great looking mirror - but the light quality is inadequate. If you have a very brightly lit area, there may be enough light - but otherwise the light emitted is very low on all three settings. Even the highest setting provides a VERY low level of illumination. Unfortunate as it is good looking - returned the item."
2,Tooooo sensitive,"I received this mirror as a gift and returned it the very next day. Every time I touched it or moved it, the light would turn off. It stated that when you touched the base the light changed but this is not true. When you touch any part of the lamp, the light either turns on or off and this is quite frustrating as you are using it.Would not recommend this mirror for that reason."
1,no as pictured,"The kettlebells are dipicted as colored and wide handles. However, it arrived as black (which is acceptable) but not polycoated as pictired. the handle was barely hand width. Since I'm a beginner at kettlebells I will be able to use it - but not worth the money to ship it back and wait for another disappointment."
5,much better then i was expecting it to be.,"i have there first cd it is really good, but my taste in music has become a bit heavier in the years since there debut album came out.anyway, i've been putting off buying this cd since it came out, dumb,dumb, dumb decision. this cd completely floored me and surprised the heck out of me how good it is.it is so catchy and the choruses, after listing to this i think i will be going back and purchasing there last 2 releases i skipped out on because of narrow minded reviers on many other sites.if you like power metal at all, you have to buy this cd, and don't think about it for months like i did. damn this cd is good."
2,Their Worst Album So Far,"The day this was released I was in one of the local CD stores ready to spend some of my hard earned cash, This album came as a suprise to me because I didn't know it was coming out (not that something like that happening is a bad thing) so since I loved their first album, thought that Chapters and Sceptre were also fairly good I decided why not buy this album. I liked Emotional Skies, I liked Purgatory Time but then what happened? all the remaining tracks, in my opinion were crap. I know this band is better than this, hopefully their next one will be better since Mathias Blad is back, if you don't beleive me check out their website www.falconermusic.com"
5,A real treat for Lucia fans...,"What a fantastic cd! I fell in love with this cd before it even came out, from its 30 second samples. The lyrics are beautiful and the listener get a feeling of intimacy with Lucia, very quickly. Of course, I am biased...I got to meet Lucia after a KMFDM concert in Tampa...she signed my shirt, too...she's very approachable and has a down-to-earth nature. Thank you for a wonderful cd, Lucia!"
3,She's not a KMFDM side-kick.+,"I really like the sound of Lucia's vocals, whether it is her screams or her melodies. She's pretty entertaining to watch on stage as well.Lucia has a Tobey Torres vibe in her voice. Lucia's got a lot more power though. This album is your vocal album. Lot's of females go solo. Liv Kristine's work on Deus Ex Machina has that melodic and acoustic vibe on her album. There's also the electro-dance songs on these types of vocal albums.Tracks to Remember are:""Who asked you?""""Monkey Puzzle Tree?""""Fear""KMFDM fans, this isn't some Raymond Watts side project. I wouldn't mind if Cheryl Wilson, or Dorona Alberti would release an album. I miss those KMFDM days, but Lucia is a fine addition to the later KMFDM.KMFDM who? This is Lucia."
4,A great solo debut from a member of KMFDM,"Lucia is the female vocalist on many of KMFDM's songs. However, don't expect the KMFDM industrial sound here. There are certainly influences as Sascha K. from KMFDM collaborates on some songs with her, and even contrubutes some vocals, but this is most certainly her own sound. It's pop-rock infused with a bit of electronic, but there are many other sounds and influences contained including Industrial and Goth, even if ever so subtle.Definitely worth listening to. One of the best albums/artists you'll never hear on the radio."
3,One of the fasteners already broke off,We had to buy a new one because the fasteners broke off the other one. One has alrady broke off this one. The rest seems like solid construction. Not thrilled!
1,Very Cheap!,"I was expecting something heavy duty. (Like the old version I have.) This is light-weight and CHEAPLY made. (Like the way...a LOT of things have gone...) It easily bends and when manufacturing, they didn't even take the time to clean off the excess plastic from their molding machine...so that is still on the crate. Because of it, I will NOT buy another online...it is better to see them in person and decide. And having purchased this one...I know FOR SURE not to ever get another of it."
4,A Great Action Movie,"It is a great action movie. You will like Richard Norton and Kathy Long and all the weird and intimidating characters. The story line is also good. Richard is a hustler trying to sell his establishment, but makes a mistake in trying to unload his product on someone who is a bigger crook than himself. But it has a ""happy ending"" - which is my ""cup of tea""."
4,An Infantry Man's View,"As an Infantry man in WW II,( 25th Divison, 35 Inf. Regt)I have been there done that, seen that. This book tells the reader what it was like, How it stunk, The hurt, frustration, and most of all the ""ugly"" side of all wars."
1,The Greatest War,"This book contains quotations from participants that are totallyerroneous.For one, I was the only witness with T/Sgt.Beauford T. Anderson on Kakazu Ridge on Okinawa in the early morning hours of April 13th 1945 when he threw mortar shells by hand at the Japanese soldiers.In fact, I was the one who handed the shells to him, and there were no other witnesses,as stated in the book.The rest of our platoon remained inside the concrete burial vault.When daylight came he left to report to the Observation Post and received a gunshot wound through the flesh of his arm on the way.All the rest of this day's activities by Sgt,Anderson as stated in the book are a fabrication.I know this all to be a fact since it was I who wrote the citation that resulted in his receiving the Medal of Honor for his outstanding feat.Hans Kaufmann , Co.A 381st Infantry, 96th Division."
3,Minister's Black Veil,"Do not be mislead by the title of the book. Nathaniel Hawthorne does it again. This book does reveal great insights through its theme. The reverend assumes the black veil before the day's church meeting. In both events, high supernatural events occur, and the veil's true nature begins to become unraveled. The protagonist conceals his secret sin. By concealing his ""secret sin,"" Mr. Hooper essentially helps other Puritans to realize everyone has a ""secret sin.""I would recommend this book, because I was fooled in the beginning to what the story was about. Read it, it will surprise you."
3,Luthien's Gamble,"R.A. Salvatore proves with this book that he was, at the time, running short on original ideas. Drizzt is my favorite character of all time, so I am fully aware of Salvatore's talents, but this book is lacking - much like the others in the series. For starters, there are just TOO many similarities to Tolkien to be ignored - the names Luthien and Eriador have been ripped right out of Middle-earth. The battle with the dragon is clearly the confrontation between Smaug and Bilbo modified to fit into Salvatore's story. And lastly, the character Brind'Amore, though a decent character, seems very much akin to Gandalf and therefore lacks in originality. The two major things that make this book worth reading, however, are Salvatore's trademark action scenes and the wonderful ""highway-halfling,"" Oliver De'Burrows. But if you haven't read any of the Drizzt books, read them instead."
2,I'm not impressed.,"For being R.A. Salvatore's #1 fan, (yeah, I'm the one), I'm really surprised this book was written by him. It lacks any shock value. Luthien was about as predictable as Presidents Clinton's denial, lacking substance and reality. A few characters did manage however to keep me mildly intrested in at least finishing the book. I won't be reading any continuations."
3,A sequence about an Ireland like country?,"Middle Earth type fantasy set in an island that looks very much like Ireland?The wizards and heroes of this tale are kind of English with ashift toward Ireland, maybe? Elves, dwarves, cyclops, demons and dragonsinhabit the text.The name Eriador for the north kingdom that is ""freed"" in thissecond book in the series that gives me the thought it resembles Ireland.If you like swashbuckling fantasy,you should like this one.It even has a kind of sense of humor.It is better than the other R. A. Salvatore series that I have read, so far."
4,"Slow start, great final.","The second book of the ""Crimson Shadow"" is what I have expected - very good adventure story with a lot of combats. However that the first chapters are kinda boring(Luthien doesn't know who to love - Sioban, beautiful female halfelf or Catherin, his first girlfriend), the final is awesome, with hearthstopping magical duel.Reccomended."
2,The worst Salvatore book that I've read,"I usually love Salvatore's books, wishing that they would never end. The opposite was true for this book. The plot is basically this: Luthien fights millions of cyclopeans. That's about it. If you haven't read The Demon Awakens or the other books in that series, get those instead."
5,Fantasy at it's best!,"If you have never read any of Mr. Salvatore's books,your missing out. I am in my mid-twenties and a huge fantasyfan, who is constantly reading. Once I recieved one of his booksI had to have them all. In my opinion he is by far one of thebest fantasy authors of all time. Do yourself a favor if youlike fantasy, and pick up one of his books. You won't regret it,I guarantee it."
1,The worst novel of R.A. Salvatore,This book is awful. Don't waste your time and money with this uninspiring work. Don't buy it.
2,Uncomfortable pockets,"Very difficult to reach into the side pockets, and the front pockets are way too open, allowing items inside to fall out when you sit in a car for example. I use them only to go to the park or beach when I won't have anything in the pockets."
1,misrepresented.,"if you are looking for 100 percent cotton shorts, these are not them. these are 65/35 percent poly/cotton blend."
2,Shorts,"Product was OK but tends to run small. Construction was adequate, but not much here to brag about."
3,Very light weight pair of shorts,Looking for shorts with a specific inseam and bought these. The quality was a little less than I expected but they work well on 90 degree days. I would not purchase another pair.
5,A short review on my shorts that aren't to short.,"I bought shorts. I didn't think it was any big deal. I guess I must be wrong. sooooooo, Oh my God I love these shorts. The shorts are so nice. I've never had shorts like this before. What a pair of shorts. My butt looks much smaller. Look at it, doesn't it look smaller? I think it looks smaller. It feels smaller also. Here, you put these shorts on and see if your butt doesn't look smaller. Oops, well, on you they don't help but look at me, my butt looks smaller. And the front of these shorts, wow, I look much bigger now. Look at the front of my shorts, don't I look bigger now? No, No, don't touch it, No don't touch it. Oh my God, touch it, touch it. Oh these shorts have changed my life. Can I buy these shorts by the gross?"
4,Just what I needed,"The two reasons I bought this book were the striking photography and the ease of use. I was not disappointed. The routines are simple and can be done anywhere, which is great. I highly recommend it."
2,disappointed,I purchased this to use on the desk chair in my office at work. I was basically interested in the heat feature. The heat and massage turn off after 15 minutes. This is described as a safety precaution but it is highly annoying to have to re-set everything every 15 minutes.jr
4,HoMedics BKL-100 Squish Massaging Lumbar Massager with Heat,This works best as a massager. I wasn't able to feel much of the heat. I use it at work and at home.
1,Disappointed,"Product does not generate enough heat to provide relief to sore, aching muscles. The ""massaging"" action is actually a vibration action. When heat is switched on, the vibration action is reduced dramatically."
3,Whatever,"It doesn't blow me away, but it feels okay. I don't really have back problems or anything so it's not like I'm trying to solve some kind of life-altering problem. Although I would confidently say: if you're trying to help serious back issues, this product probably isn't going to do much."
1,HoMedics Lumbar Massager,"HoMedics makes some good products. I have some of their others. But his one is not one of those. It sounds good in the listing, but then you get it and say...""Please remind me why I bought this?"" Skip it."
3,WOW!,"Now this is what i'm talking about, i don't need to pay big bucks to go to a spa when i've got this. There ain't nothing cheap about me. This works wonders!!"
4,ok to get but not what i aimed for,"the massage is not that efficient and u have to set it on high to feel it. The size is really huge and not as shown in the pic so u better think twice before buying (especially if u intend to use in car like i wanted). Finally it doesn't come with a car adapter, so u either count on batteries or buy one from radioshack for example."
4,Missionary adventures with the Lisu Indians in western China,"Isobel Kuhn writes of her experiences with the Lisu Indians as a missionary with China Inland Mission. It was heartbreaking to read of so many Lisu Indians who died of cancer or of some other disease. And at such young ages. But it was inspiring to read of how sold out they were for Jesus Christ. As I read the book, I almost felt like I was right there on the mission field. Good reading!"
1,Religious!!!,Very disappointed. My intention behind buying this book was to understand why someone would commit suicide. This book has nothing but religious (Catholic) throughout the entire book. Very disappointed.
5,What a ball!,I really like this book and the exercises. {The ball} puts you in good alignment. Exercises aren't so strenuous. You don't have to use weights in all exercises.
2,"preachy tone, too wordy","The tone of this book is so preachy and condescending that I can't seem to get to the exercises themselves. Each chapter begins with a several-page story about a person whose life was turned around their work with the author on Pilates. Then there are several long pages of essays, with lots of quotations and name-dropping and helpful self-improvement tips like ""every day you will need to restart"" and ""one becomes old when fixities of habits are established.""I am sure that there are subtleties about the approach that need to be conveyed. However, I would prefer to use a book with a more direct writing style so I can get the information I need quickly and get on with my workout."
5,Great Deal,"I was a bit nervous on how the Opal would look in person, but the one I received was in perfect condition. The silver was flawless with a nice stamp on it. Also, the back of the pendant is filled, so it has a nice weight when combined with a chain. Can't beat the price, even if it is lab created."
2,A Few Good Songs...,There are three or four music I enjoy it. I could be live without listen to others.
1,Not Max Spicker,"I just ordered this item from a different seller, based on the same description, which says that this is the Max SPicker version of the opera anthology. It is most definitely not; it is the Kurt Adler edition. The Max Spicker version is out of print and includes a lot of music that isn't available in the later editions, so if you're looking for the Max Spicker, this isn't it."
4,My mom liked it but it shipped with a broken chain,She thought it was very pretty although you have to specify if you want the pearl headed one or the other one but it shipped with a broken chain. Very pretty silver angel.
3,"great for beginners, too bad I'm not one","I'm really flexible and my chiropractor suggested doing exercises to build up my back muscles specifically. I've been practicing yoga off and on for the last 5 years and was not challenged by this video. The instruction is great, and it's a great warm-down for me, but it's very beginner level. This would make a great first buy if you're looking to start yoga. It would probably be a great DVD for someone who may be a bit overweight but still able to move around. There are no super difficult poses if you can do a kneeling lunge without toppling over. BONUS: there is an index of poses on the DVD. Great for beginners to learn the names and postures of various poses."
5,another yoga zone 20 minute favorite,"the first time through this the first part almost killed me! I am overweight and at the time I had just started exercising. this has a lot of twists..tons of them (which I like doing now if I'm warmed up). all I remembered after the 1st time through were the twists and downdog seems like. So, when I attempted it a 2nd time I did the 2nd program and loved it! Douglas leads the 2nd program and does a variety like boat and fan pose..just overall a very nice workout. I like the 2nd program when my back feels a little tight and slightly achey because it stretches me out."
2,Strong back? I don't think so...,Misleading title...If you suffer low back pain and need help strengthening those muscles this is NOT the dvd for you. If you have problems rotating at the mid back or suffer muscle spasms in the lat area this will cause problems as it did for me. If you want an upper/mid back mild stretch then by all means buy it because it is definately good for that. If you need to gain strength in the core to aleviate low back pain NOT due to injury but due to inactivity then I would suggest Back In Action Total Fitness For Your Core by Jon Mello. This will give you the exercise foundation you need.
4,"Good, but short","The pace and poses are good with a level of effort ranging from beginner to intermediate. However, the DVD is short on content. There are only two sessions (about 20min each) and there should be at least four. Unfortunately, there seems to be no other DVDs targeting the lower back, so by default, this is the best shot."
3,Cheesy with a Horrible DVD Menu Layout,"I couldn't get through five minutes of the DVD, though I will give it another chance. My initial impression was that it was horribly cheesy, and then when it brought you to the main DVD menu, it only had begin work-out. You couldn't choose to only do a shorter workout if you wanted--it would just play the full 40 minute DVD.Also, if it's focusing on back pain, I would like to start off slow, maybe on the floor, before I get into the standing postures.However, it was filmed in a nice, setting as opposed to other DVDs with a simple, white background and a mat. Also, even though cheesy, the instructors seemed nice and competent."
1,Disappointing,"I am disappointed with this DVD. I have other Yoga Zone DVD which you can really use to exercise and get benefit from it, but this one will just show you yoga poses and then you're on your own. Don't expect to sweat on this one."
3,NOT GOOD WITH FMS OR ARTHRITIS,"I purchased this DVD in hopes of finding some relief for my continuing back problems. The reviews were great and from so many people! But alas, it's not for me. I have Fibromyalgia, Crohn's Disease and OsteoArthritis and these 3 health problems are screaming ENOUGH ALREADY! Fortunately I purchased Healing Yoga For Aches & Pains and that Yoga DVD is working much better for me. I find it's much easier and so much more comfortable to do the positions in the Healing Yoga than in the Yoga For A Strong & Healthy Back.However, I do feel that if it weren't for my chronic health problems using this DVD would be very beneficial. The moves aren't ""pretzel"" moves and I've convinced my sister to give it a try. She's healthier than I am!"
3,"Not challenging, even for a beginner",This is only the second Yoga Zone video I've tried and I really didn't like it. I'm fairly new to yoga and I take a class once a week. This video was almost too easy for me. I am fairly flexible but I felt as if I didn't get anything out of this video. There were a few poses that I'll probably incorporate in my weekly routine but that's about it.
5,Great book!!,"Bought this book as it was recommended on various websites as a guide for birding in Mexico. Upon browsing through this book it looks like a great reference guide for our birding trip to San Blas, Nayarit, Mexico this winter."
4,Intuitive and Easy to Use,The product is very intuitive and easy to use. Without reading a manual I am able to do all the things I want to do to organize my photos. I also spend quite a bit of time annotating photos to highlight key features for training. The one shortcoming is that there is no draw feature to drop an arrow in or create a circle to pin point items I want to draw attention to.Otherwise it is a great product and one often suggest for those working with photos to consider.
1,Garbage,"I used a bundled package in a new laptop to create a photo album. When trial time expired, I purchase the full package. I could not open the existing album with the new software. The new full package is hard to use and the so called 1000's of templates can not be found. USE SOMETHING ELSE!!!I even e-mailed Corel about this. Its been 4 days, I have NOT had a response.DO NOT BUY!!! I RATE THIS PRODUCE AS A -2 STARS."
2,always hang,I do not like software. It always hang no matter what I did. Maybe this is becasue it has not finished the index process? I had many many photos in my computer.
2,Photos,"I am very disappointed with this product. Using the features of it are very difficult (red eye, sizing, etc.) in addition, digital photos downloaded into Photo Album 6 are of poor quality/clarity on the computer screen. I expected more from it but have found I have less. I will not buy an upgrade but rather will look for another product with similar and more easy use features."
4,An OK photo tool for your computer.,"This software works well for the job intended.Only complaint I have is that it has an annoying habit of loading on your computer if you open any other software that has pictures, such as a memory stick, etc., then you have to turn Corel off.Probably a way to stop that, but I haven't taken time to do it yet."
3,"The Last Good Album by a Fantastic Group, But Not Their Best","I have loved Procol Harum since their first single was released, and I saw them every time they came to San Francisco starting in the Fall of 1968. I consider them one of the greatest groups ever, sort of the classical music of rock. I highly recommend all their albums/CDs, but this one marked the end of their greatness for me. I like the songs, but they had run out of gas to some extent. I feel the same about their ""Exotic Birds and Fruit"" album/CD; it just didn't make it somehow. This is a good but not great release, and what followed was a downhill plunge for the group."
3,Still had it,"3 1/2Although Procol's Ninth is said to mark a clear decline in the group's compositional quality, and despite a few clear misses, there was still an awful lot of solid structure abound where the band proved their unique mixture of classic and progressive rock was still somewhat potent."
2,Total Disapointment!,"Brathing fire? who sais kung fu and tae kwon do is the same is so wrong and should be ashame!yes this is the worse buy i have made DONT GO WHIT THE TITLE! this set has nothing to do whit shaolin! the movie young tiger is not in it, there is another of chans movies a realy bad one by the way (rumble in hong kong)the only movie that keeps me from burning this set is snake & crane secret and the box is realy nice if you like to brag about your Fu colection just seal the case whit crazy glue and tell your friends its empty!"
3,Good but not Great,"The good stuff; This unit does do a good job of cooling a large room as advertised. The controls work OK.The bad stuff; The packaging is flimsy. The bottom of the carton fell apart when we tried to pick it up (wouldn't it be in Frigidare's best interest to make a sturdy shipping carton?). The bottom corners of the casing (all 4) were dented from rough treatment. And be warned, if you are installing this unit into a casement window you had better have the following opening dimentions - width between 15 1/2"" and 16 1/4"" (not much room for error here), height no taller than 39 7/16"", or you better have some skills because you are going to need them to make it fit. My window opening was 22"" and the height was 43"" so I had to buy a piece of 3/4"" plywood (at $64) and make an insert for the window opening that the unit would fit into. It would have been better if my window was a sliding unit, the width wouldn't have mattered but the height would still have been a problem."
1,Could not play it !,"I was very disapponited. I was not able to play this DVD on neither my standalone DVD player nor on my computer one. How does a product like this get past inspection? I must add that there was no problem getting a refund, but I still wish that I could have seen it."
1,Bad. Sty away,"This product clocked 100 steps when I stood up from sitting down. I tried using it a bit more carefully, still the same results. A waste of money, I do not recommend it to anyone."
1,What a Stupid Idea.,"I realize that an American tradition is mocking great writers and painters, but this is ridiculous. Why don't all these idiots go and write their own books? What did Faulkner do to deserve such a FATE? And this brings up a question: WHAT kind of PERSON would WASTE their time reading ""faux"" Faulkner? The only answer to that QUESTION is No one. No one who has read Faulkner would EVEN BOTHER to imitate him. The only people left to read this book are bored old ladies sipping tea in the south and amusing themselves with a little LITE SOUTHERN ""LITERATURE."""
4,Good deal!,"This is super cute! It is a little smaller than I anticipated, but will still look great as the table centerpiece in our cabin. Price is good and the product was delivered fast. I wouldn't hesistate to buy anything from River's Edge!"
4,beautiful accessorries,Great product for a great price. The finish on this air cleaner is outstanding. I can't believe I could get such car products from Amazon.
2,Keep Looking...,"Although the title seems promising for those interested in part-time opportunites, this book was merely a subset of Ramsey's 101 Best Home-Based Businesses The business examples in this book were basically copied straight from his other book with nothing new added. I suppose it's OK as an idea generator, but the coverage of each is so sparce it leaves you wanting more. Keep looking guys..."
2,Lightweight,"Not particularly helpful either for considering what kind of business you might set up or the pro and con of running such a business. Very much a ""how to"" writer writing how to start a business. If you're looking for readable, non-textbook sources of information, I might recommend ""In Business For Yourself"" by Bruce Williams instead."
2,The book was a good one for starting ideas to flow.,"I was pleased with the content, however I found that the phone numbers listed to contact certain organizations were no longer in service."
4,Take it for what it is!,"This book is a quick and easy read. It is not a full book and starting and running a business, however it briefly covers the subject. It is an idea generator on businesses you can start rather quickly and cheaply, and you will have to do further research most likely but this is a start!"
4,Versatile Speakers,Very acceptable quality for such small speakers. Liked that capabilty to hang them on the wall in back of computer.
4,Great for the price,"These are good little speakers. Just what you would expect for the price. The carrying case is deffinently a nice feature. They will travel well in your laptop case, as long as it's big enough. Plus they are USB powered, so no extra cables."
3,OK WHEN ABOUT THE CIVIL WAR,"The current issue (July 2012) has a lengthy dissertation by the editor, in response to a reader, on his (the editor's) viewpoint concerning the role of Christianity in the origin of the destruction of European Jewry in World War II. This is an interesting topic, but it has nothing to do with the American Civil War (1861-1865),which is the subject about which I thought I would read when I plunked down my six bucks. And frankly, who cares what Keith thinks about it?Try Blue and Gray. That magazine deals with events (mostly battles) of the war in depth and includes a driving tour. Best on the market for the subject."
5,The RON Howard Action Pack (EAT MY DUST/Grand Theft Auto),I bought this movie for Christmas for my brother who is a died hard car lover of the older generation and he LOVES it
3,So-So Characters But A Cute Story,"The characters in this novel didn't particularly move me, although the premise of the story was good. The characters' motives for marriage were shallow at best and a man with money would surely have been more cautious about marriage (even in name only) to a woman he didn't know. And a woman responsible for two small children would surely be more cautious about the man she proposes marriage to.The ending left something to be desired and I have to admit I felt cheated. Instead of the anticipated showdown between the heroine and her good-for-nothing brother-in-law over the two children in the story, the demise of the brother-in-law struck me as a little too convenient. An easy way to get him out of the picture."
1,"Tiny gloves, tiny fish","I bought this for my high school special education students to use during swim class. The packaging says 'Magnetic Dive Gloves age 6+'. These gloves barely fit on my five year old's hands and certainly don't fit on the hands of my students. The material around the wrist has no give to it at all, so attempting to get them on (and get them on while wet) is beyond frustrating. The magnetic portion is a tiny piece in the palm of the glove so it's actually in the concave part of the hand. It's rather difficult to actually get the tiny piece to connect."
5,Awesome,These rock - my neighbor's kids spent a half-hour hour on them alone.Sweet - so we could drink up without interruption..//
3,Closed Reel Fiberglass Measuring Tape [200'],"The quality is OK, the tape is not paper but somewhat ""paper"" like. Not the quality of the tape I've owned for 25 years but is only 100' hence the purchase of a this 200' tape. For the price would buy again.I would have preferred it had an end that would clip into/onto a starting point like a jump board. It would make it easy for one person to use. I didn't expect this to have that type of connection like some do but it was a bit hard to tell from the picture preview at the time of purchase."
3,Cute but not as comfortable as other Bearpaw styles,"Not crazy about this Abigail fit at all! I have several Bearpaw Emma style boots and they are not as comfy or warm as my ""U"" brand, but they are ok. This style is just not as comfortable to me. Way LESS shearling inside. They aren't awful but they are tighter across the top of the foot where the stitching is and there seems to be so much less shearling inside the boot that I can feel the stitching on the top of my foot in this Abigail style boot. These just have to go back and I will stick with the Emma styles when I need a pair and don't want to spend the extra bucks required for the ""U"" brand.Sizing runs true to me. I normally wear a 6 1/2 but I buy Bearpaws in a size 6. Not uncomfortable at all and within a few days of wearing them, they stretch some. In fact, the width stretches out too much! If I were to size up, they would be too big"
3,boots,They were really nice boots at first but after a couple months one of the rubber strands broke and I was saddened that I spent all that much money on shoes that just broke after a couple months...
2,I loved them...at first,"I got these wonderful, warm and cozy boots, so i would not have to worry about the cold of Cleveland. The first month I had them they were fantastic, I told everyone about them. Then the soles began to crack, so now I cannot wear them or my socks get wet. I have owned these boots for a month, I didn't think that was long enough to break them. I am hoping it is a fluke that this happened, since I have friends who have bought themselves and their daughters a pair."
2,Sizing is way off!,Cute boots...unfortunately the sizing is way off. I normally take a size 6. Got these today and they are too tight. My toes are cramped in these boots. If you are ordering these I would highly recommend ordering one size larger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed.
2,Soft But Not Sturdy,"These boots feel great on your feet, but I had the same problem as other where the buttons just fall off..Seems like a consistent quality issue. If you don't mind the defect they do feel warm and cozy."
1,The strap broke,"I bought the boots for my daughter and after a few hours of wearing them, the button strap broke. Very disappointed."
2,not so much,I simply feel these boots run narrow.dissappointed. I had a pair of the victorian style of bear paws and I found them quitecomfy. This abigail style is just too narrow.bad investment
4,Wrong color,"the quality is good but the color is definitely not birch, but smoke. Anyway, it is a pair of nice boots."
4,great boot!,I love bearpaw boots! Much cheaper than uggs and just as warm and comfortable. They tend to run small so with the lining so I recommend buying the next size up. I wish I would have done that but they are still great!
2,Not as pictured; not good if you have thinner legs,"These boots looked cute in the picture in the product description (dark brown boots with dark brown buttons), but when they came they actually had cream colored buttons that stood out more than I liked. They also do not fit well if you have thinner legs, they did not fit snugly around my calves and looked big and bulky. I sent them back for a refund."
4,Cute,"I'm very sceptical in buying things online but so far so good. Their comfortable and warm. I'm usually a size 6 1/2 so you must order a size up. No problem with the product. Love them..,"
5,Love them,"They are comfortable, fit great, look good and true to size and color. If you looking for this kind of boot I highly recommend them. They cost way less then Ugg and are made in the USA"
2,Poor quality construction,"The product arrived on time and it looked good quality at first but the side buttons fell off after just two days of use. My daughter is known to be careful with her shoes and clothing, so the boots were not abused or anything similar that would justify what happened. We looked at the way the thread holding the buttons was done and it was very poor quality. I hope the boots don't fall apart too."
5,Fantastic Buy,Fantastic Buy....the are perfectly sized and comfortable.....my feet have never been warmer when I have been out and aboutin the cold...in fact I loved them so much I ordered a pair in black....would definitely recommend them.....
2,Disappointed,Button fell off 2nd wear now I have to pay to have them fixed. Bear paws were recommended too. Sad.
5,Great boots,"I got 2 pair of these boots, one for my self and one for my nice.Great price, and great quality, super fast deleveryI highly recomended these boots.WTBoston"
