5,It works!,I have been using it as perscribed all the time and it appears to work as described. I evan gave one to my son for Xmas.
3,Interesting premise but muddled direction ruins it,"The story could have been great, a family of cannibals must fend for themselves when their father suddenly dies. On paper, the movie appears to be sensational. The death of the father, brings responsibility and new problems, to this family off cannibals who must find a way to feed themselves. the characters are also very interesting, coupled with some incestuous feelings, homosexuality and a crazy mom but they never take flight. An average film but could have so promising. Three stars"
4,Question is: What Are They?,"Not sure what percentage of the gene pool in the family of central interest in this movie is vampire, is cannibal, or is just mentally not very stable but I will, even surprising to me, give credit to the writers for coming up with a storyline that hasn't either been done before or very seldom so.Also, I give credit to the family members for a fairly good performance in portraying whatever it is that they were. However, the other acting roles had that ""hired extras acting pool"" feel to their performances.The rest of the production crew - directing, filming, sets, etc. were OK adequate for this low budget horror endeavor."
2,Less a journey of discovery than a filmmaker withholding information,"Some very good moment to moment filmmaking but, where I enjoy a movie which is a journey of discovery, revealing its story as it progresses, this felt more like the filmmaker withholding information throughout the movie - and I never learned enough to make it a satisfying experience. That said, this film shows a lot of promise for a first film and I'll definitely give Grau's next film a look."
5,Christmas music cd,"A Music Box Christmas is an entire CD of music boxes playing Christmas songs. It's beautiful. No vocals, only real music boxes. I enjoy letting it play softly throughout the holidays on my indoor and outdoor speakers as beautiful holiday background music to our festivities. I highly recommend it."
5,Wonderful rich sound,"This feels identical to the vinyl album my Mother played many years ago - so much so that she wore it out and I bought her another copy. The sound of the music boxes is an intesting mix, and it is not something you often hear. These are actual music boxes and not simulations. Essentially - enjoyable with complex melody and a warm, rich tone."
2,Nostalgic Christmas Purchase,"As an avid collector of Christmas CDs, I was excited to see this re-make of a 33rpm I owned years ago. This is delightfully fun music to awaken the memory of Christmas Past! The quality is excellent; if you listen carefully you can hear the mechanism movements of the boxes themselves. The fast-paced brillance and unusual harmony of the rendition of Jingle Bells is worth the purchase of this CD."
5,Invite the spirit of Christmas!,This has become a favorite at our house. It is very much in tune with the spirit of Christmas. You won't be disappointed!! Who knew such beautiful music could come from a music box?
5,Decorating the Christmas Tree,"As a child, one of my first memories of Christmas was shaking a present and hearing music. Whether you have memories of music boxes from Christmas, a ballerina jewelry box from Childhood (where you opened the box and the ballerina spun around as music played) or you found yourself in a magical music box store, this creates the music box mood. The authentic sounds are created by real music boxes which makes this a unique find! This CD transports me back to my childhood and is perfect for the holiday season. A wonderful scented L'Occitane Winter Forest Candle also seems essential or you can play this while decorating the Christmas tree or wrapping presents. The magic of music boxes comes through perfectly and this CD takes you to the place where Christmas dreams are born.~The Rebecca Review"
4,Tinkling Tones for Christmas...,"Rita Ford has quite the extensive collection of music boxes. Can't listen to this all day, but it brings back memories of a sweet time in history...."
2,i am bringing my little pony to my picnic of love,"A.C. is George Alan Rekers favorite band, because so many of their ideas are shared concerning you-know-who.But ""Picnic of Love"" is his absolute *favorite* ' 'This album is a departure from most of A.C's output. Gone are the melodic elements, the superb engineering (""look out Steely Dan""), for this is their ""unplugged"" version.Lovely acoustic guitar accompanies deeply felt lyrics that inspire warm hugs all around. The vocals remind one of a mixture of Jonathan Richman and Karen Carpenter!My biggest disappointment was that Bostonian Seth Putnam chose to make fun of himself with this release. Shame on you Seth Putnam! You are so naughty!Can't wait for the MUSAK release of these classics for my elevator."
2,Experimental Doesn't Mean Good,"I listened and listened and I couldn't get into to it. It is just way too experimental. Yes, Progressive House in 2005 beginning to sound a little dirtier and techier and Fabric 20 by Digweed is a perfect example of that. I heard Sasha spin several times this year during his Fundancion monthly residency in NY and he also sounded very techy and experimental. With all that said, no one sounded this experimental. Some tracks are just plain annoying and impossible to listen to. If you want weird psychedelic sounds, you can pick up any Infected Mushrooms compilations; those are much better and actually specialize in experimentation that works. However, there is no reason to get disapointed with the Balance series. Anthony Pappa's Balance 006 is awesome;)"
2,someone said it sounds great when you're in the mood,"For starters, I love progressive and trance. I think Holden and Pappa's Balance mixes are amazing. Mr. Fortier just seems to fall flat. I never got a sense of where he was going with these mixes. Yes, there are 3 discs here, but there's no connection between all three, other than the man spinning them. It's all gone tech-house...there are no giant builds or releases...it's relatively flat over the course of all three discs. Because of this, these come off as bland sounding...sort of like Eric Clapton...sure, some people like Clapton, but if you're not a big fan, the music is just sort of *meh*. That's how this mix comes off...it's never bad, just never really shines. So if you're in the mood for Clapton..."
4,Price vs. Performance=Great outboard,"Some facts...because it's air-cooled it's louder than a 4-stroke, but not louder than a 2-stroke. It has a bit more vibration. Its slowest speed is still a pretty fast troll. Those I think are the biggest trade-offs. If those trade-offs are not acceptable to you then cough up the extra $400-600 for a 5hp 4-stroker.For the money it's a really good fishing engine. I like that I don't have to deal with a water pump repair anymore, so overall it's an easier engine to maintain. Always starts by the 3rd pull (1st pull when it's warm). I like being the only one on the water with American Iron on the transom; it has a distinctive look (I call it the FlatHead) and engine note. Overall, you'll either love it or hate it; that's pretty much the reaction you'll hear or read about it."
1,poor choice,"we bought this motor 3 years ago as a back up for an older Johnson that we thought was on its last leg. Very poor choice - rope broke first time we used it. Tried to take it back to store - they refused. Wouldn't start after we had the rope fixed. Finally got it going and now the motor has ""freezed up"" - We haven't used it more than 50 hours. Would not recommend this motor to anyone."
2,Loud and Clunky,"I really regret buying this motor. First of all, it is very loud, much louder than a water-cooled engine. It is as loud as a lawn mower if you stuck your head right down by the lawn mower engine. Second, it doesn't tilt sufficiently to get the prop out of the water like a water-cooled engine so we have to take it off the dinghy if we want to tow the dinghy. Third, the gear shift is really clunky to operate. I looked at the Mercury engines with the gear shift integrated into the throttle control and that is a much superior design.I thought I would save some money by buying this engine over a Mercury but I am going to sell this engine at the first opportunity and get the Merc I should have purchased in the first place."
3,works great after carb cleaning every year,"I have owned this outboard for 3 years.Pros: It runs well once carb is cleaned in the spring.It is less expensive than other outboards in the 5hp range.No mixing of oil and gas.Pushes my 14ft jon boat nicely with low weight.Seems to run forever on one tank of gas.Great for small lakes and streams.Cons: Loud, sounds like a riding mower with the muff cut off.Weight sensitive. Do not expect it to push 2 big people loaded with equiptment very fast.Carb needs to be cleaned once a year for optimal performance.Motor shakes the boat alot more than other outboards.No prop shear pin."
1,DON'T DO IT !!!,"PIECE OF JUNK. I'VE HAD NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, LOUD AS HECK, I MEAN HEADACHE LOUD, AND IT JUMPS LIKE A FISH WHEN YOU PUT IT IN GEAR AND USUALLY DIES. POOR DESIGN, YOU CAN'T EVEN LOCK THE MOTOR IN A RAISED POSITION TO LAND THE BOAT ON SHORE. I WAS GOING THE CHEAP ROUTE, BUT I IMMEDIATELY REGRETTED NOT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO IT AND BUYING A ""REAL"" OUTBOARD. DON'T DO IT. I TRIED TO PUT NO STARS ON THE REVIEW, BUT YOU HAVE TO PUT SOMETHING TO POST THE REVIEW, BUT, FROM MY EXPERIENCE, IT REALLY DOESN'T EVEN RATE ONE STAR."
3,"Sounds fine, gets clobbered by wifi","The sound is totally acceptable when it's working, with some occasional pops/clicks. I'm using it outside on my balcony so I don't have to blast speakers inside, annoying my neighbors.Problem is I have a lot of wifi equipment near it, and it seems to be overwhelmed by it, causing it to drop out often, and it's only 10 feet away from the transmitter. If I move the transmitter, it will also cause the wireless connection on anything close to flutter.It's fine, but not great solution if you are streaming music over your wireless network, or ... even have a wireless network, apparently! (802.11b and 802.11g use 2.4ghz, same as this device)"
3,Nice Look - Failed to Work,"Nice Design and look. However, product failed to operate. After going through all the troubleshooting, contacted the manufacturer customer service technician who said I had a faulty transmitter. Only option was to return product to original point-of-purchase for refund/replacement. No additional items in stock. I have since decided to ""hard-wire"" new speakers in my condo due to R/F interference with wireless speaker option."
2,Great until it stopped working,I was happy with the sound and design. Then one day the LED would not light up. Not a big problem; I had had this problem before and read the manual to see how to reset. This time the reset did not work. Nothing I do will make it work right though it's obviously getting power and was never dropped or anything.I wrote Oregon Scientific's help desk twice and never received a reply. Bad customer service policy guys! I guess I'll have to phone now and likely they'll have me ship it back etc...Seems like a pain for a solution that may not work and a product that wasn't so expensive to begin with.I think the electronics must be very delicate. I had only used it for 2 months when it went kaput! I can't say I trust them anymore..
1,SOME TIME YOU GET A LEMOND,"This wireless speaker system failed to work right out of the box. However; I had not problem with the return , which included return postage. I will purchase from Amazon again."
4,The best ever!,"This book was by far the best out of the Arabian Winds series! It kept me on my toes and I read it in one night! It was SO good..but i recommend you first readArabian Windsand after that oneLions of the Desertand then finally read this one but the others are so interesting that it really makes you keep on reading these books. They were so good, filled with adventures and romance the best combination ever!"
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book reads like an advertisement for the author's first book and her tours. Repeatedly, the author says that she covered this story in her first book, but she's just going to mention it here. And she repeatedly mentions what happened during her tours. There is not adequate coverage of the really famous San Antonio hauntings - in fact, I know more about some of these hauntings than the author tells, and I only lived in San Antonio for 9 months. I'm sorry I wasted my money buying this book!"
4,Very Cute,This story was very cute. If you love reading books involving animals get this one. These cats adventure keep you at the age of your seat. I've never read such a good childrens book!!
5,A great and funny book,"I remember I read this book almost 10 years ago. It is surprisingly wry, especially the beginning of the book, which chronicles Polo's anxiety. The art is great, too."
4,A bold effort to synthesize modern research with belief.,"In defense of Jacobs' much-maligned works, I believe that this book makes a valiant effort to describe a mode of Judaism that harmonizes historical-critical research and belief. Although the author himself admits that gray areas do exist in his non-traditional ""liberal supernaturalism"", it is certainly a step toward a definition of belief for today's Jews. The book is written in a very personal tone, one that some readers may find distracting; I found it to add an interesting autobiographical flavor, one that reflects Jacobs' journey from yeshiva student to Masorti proponent. Incidentally, he makes no claim that the so-called ""High criticism"" represented by Wellhausen's Documentary Hypothesis has been utterly rejected, only that it has been subject to scholarly revision and modification in recent years."
2,"Good Read, Poor Arguments","Louis Jacobs is trying his best to defend the obviously untenable position of having-the-cake-and-eating-it-too, by offering another book to explain the Jewish Conservative movements ""Liberal Supernaturalist"" view. He wants to explain how one can deny the historical truth of Judaism's core beliefs, the Revelation at Mount Sinai, and the divine source of the Oral Code - while at the same time stay committed to the observance of Halacha. The core of Jacobs' argument is that Biblical Criticism is a scientific fact. But when faced with the fact that modern scientists totally reject the premise of High Criticism - he reverts to the indefensible stance that current critics do not accept the divine source of the Torah. The current rejection of the ""popular"" Criticism is enough to give the believer a reason to stand by his beliefs.It is also quite boring to read the history of English Jewry and the personal adventures of Jacobs the person.Still, it is a good read."
2,Not a great knife,"The CRKT M-16 is not a terribly good knife. First off, I find closing it a real pain in the keister. You have to depress a safety knob before you can push the liner lock out of the way to close the knife. This makes one handed closing a bit of a chore. With practice it can be done, but I think the system is overly complicated. Also, the action gets stuck at times and you have to exert quite a bit of force to move the liner lock. Just another thing to go wrong and it makes the knife undependable.The knife is, to its credit, very sharp. But the handle feels cheap and does not sit well in the hand. It also does not ride well clipped inside a pocket. I only carry the knife if think I'll need to lend it out. If it gets lost I won't mind. For a little more you can get an excellent knife like the Sog Blink."
3,"Compared to the 4""","I recently purchased the 3"" blade. I have bought at least five 4"" blades in the past and I am impressed with everything about them. I thought I would try the three inch for once. I found the blade did not open as easily as the 4"". The blade is lighter and you must flick your wrist to get it to open compared to the 4"". I have even oiled up the hinge with only slight improvement. Other than that, the knife is lighter and the blade design is good. I would not buy another one, but only because I like the ease of opening without the flick of the wrist. I will continue with the 4"" knives by CRKT."
2,disappointed.,"i was very disappointed with this knife. i say ""was"" since i returned it. the liner lock was missing its ball bearing detente, instead there was a hole. now.....i am a die hard crkt fan, so i returned and got the m16-01kz. my replacement knife is the shiz, i love it to death.this knife felt cheap. thats about it. the blade didnt feel good, the cut of the materials felt shotty. overall, i was very very unimpressed. unimpressed enough to return it and consequently go without a knife for 5 days (unheard of for me).This is one of the cases in life where you get what you pay for...unfortunately. i guess even the great crkt isnt infallible."
4,"Very sharp, discrete","Within five minutes of opening this knife, I managed to deeply penetrate the side of my finger. I was able to stop the bleeding with pressure but I was really impressed with how easily the blade penetrated my calloused flesh. Later, my wife took me to a local furniture store and my cut opened up and I got blood all over the floor. I'm not sure that the employee who handled cleanup followed OSHA protocol when handling blood, though.I give the knife 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a little smaller than other M-16 knives."
2,its not durable,"lets start off by saying that i own a multitude of crkt knives and i love most of them. sadly, i do not love this one. granted the blade is sharp but everything else blows. i dropped this knife from a foot off the ground and it broke. its a piece of crap compared to the other brands of crkt m16 and i strongly suggest you buy a different knife if you want reliability and duribility."
4,Nice Blade bit small in the hand,CRKT is a great company and they make hig quality knives. I like the look of their handle and the fluid movement during opening. The safety can be a bit combersome and the handle is a bit small in the hand making gripping a bit unsecure - I wear a medium glove.
2,CRKT M16-10Z,My first CRKT knife and this one appeared to be used. It was sharpened by someone not familar with cutlery and knife edges. I guess I prefer to see and handle the product before I purchase it. Plus you may pay a bit more but you don't have to pack-up your item and ship it back and turn around time is greatly reduced.
3,weirdly uncomfortable,"The thumbstuds were so uncomfortable that I replaced them with a set from another knife. The safety is unnecessary, and ironically, it makes one-handed closing unsafe. When clipped into my pocket, rubbing my hand against the exposed joint end is nearly painful. I've never been so frustrated with a knife. It looks good, works well, but overall, I wouldn't buy it again. It'll end up in one of my cars' spare equipment bags. Too bad, because the shape is just delightful. Good try, Columbia River! Better luck next time."
3,Not a bad knife.,"My opinion is that I find the thumb stud awkward to use, perhaps beacuse the 10ZK size is overall too small for my preference. It has jumped out of my hand a few times trying to open it manipulating it from the waist clipped to the opening position. I think I would have prefered the larger version instead because I can hold on to it easier. The small size of this knife does make it easier to conceal if you need to have that feature in the environment you are in. I think the groves on the thumbstud and on the top of the blade could have been finished off a little better as it looks cheap and feels uncomfortable because they are so uneven and rough on my knife. I don't like the autolawks safety. I prefer a simple liner lock without the extra step to close it."
3,pocket clip...,"Pretty pleased with the knife... except for the pocket clip. The blade is sharp, the tanto shape is functional, the opening and locking systems are great, and the knife is lightweight and sexy, BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS IF THE KNIFE ISN'T IN YOUR POCKET.After having this knife as my EDC for just a week or two, the pocket clip had loosened to the point where it would wobble side-to-side by several millimeters. Not a huge deal at first, as you can fix the problem with some loctite and a torx bit. The real problem is that even with the screws tightened down all the way the clip just doesn't want to hold on that hard. It's come out of my pocket several times, and the knife is now lost forever.Anyway, I liked the knife a lot when I was using it, but the pocket clip sucks. I have one of CRKT's other knifes (the Drifter, love it) and the clip is much sturdier. I wish they had put that one on here."
3,CRT M16-10Z,"When holding and using the knife it exudes quality. In the oilfields it comes in handy for small tasks. Just one problem...I hate the Autolawk, cant stand having to deal with it to close the knife. So I just ordered the Columbia River Knife and Tool's 1160 McGinnis Tuition. The M16-10Z will get some use...albiet sparingly."
5,Solid,"Out of all my folding knives, this one stands out. First it has a double safety feature, meaning two pressure points must be pressed at the same time to close it. Second when it is open it is a very solid blade with no movement. Third, I have learned how to open it almost as fast as a switch blade with the flick of the wrist and one handed. Its solid construction, ability to open fast one handed (even left handed) and heavier weight make this knife one of the best in my collection. I trust I could handle any job with this knife for its type. Highly recommended."
4,nice little knife,"This is a great little EDC knife for the $$$. Smooth, sharp and very lightweight. Not as fast opening as the Ken Onion series but quick enough for the casual user. I'm going to get a couple more for around the house/garage/shop."
2,Great function but crappy assembly,"I love the functionality this knife and carry it everywhere. I use it at least 20 times each day at work. Seriously. The quick-open blade is really cool. The Tanto style is unbeatable. The double lock is a bit too much but ignorable. I gave it three stars becasue the incredibly small Torx screws that hold it all together loosen VERY quickly and fall out. Now that two of them have disappeared I tighten the remainder about once per week. You will need to go to an electronics store to get a Torx driver small enough.Update: Downgraded to two stars. The double lock is not ignorable. As I use the knife more and more, the lock wedges itself in place and is difficult if not dangerous to dislodge. I still love what this knife wants to deliver but the execution of it is pretty bad."
2,Unpleasantly surprised.,"Currently, I am EDCing a CRKT Pazoda 6480 and it is one of my favorite knives. The Pazoda is my first CRKT knife and wanted a second one. The Columbia River M16-10Z EDC 3-inch Folding Knife exhibited major flaws right out of the box and has been returned.Cons*So much blade play when closing that the blade scrapes the inside of the handle. Tightened the pivot screw to stop this and the knife became impossible to open.*Thumbstud is impossible to use - It is flush with the handle and there is no room for your thumb to push it.*Flipper does not open the knife smoothly - Loosening the pivot screw did not help.*AutoLAWK system did not activate every time.*Difficult to close knife with one hand - Did not deduct a star for thisPros*Good steel for the price - Bought it for ~$16*Tanto blade shape*Very light*Looks cool*Good pocket clipI own many knives and this one was very disappointing."
4,Handy knife for the money,"This is a great knife that gets used almost every day, due to the fact that it is very easy to keep handy.It is a solidly built knife. The blade isn't terribly sharp, and even when sharpening, it never gets razor sharp.The clip is very handy...it stays clipped securely to my back pocket, and it's easy to put back there without getting snagged up. However, the 3 small screws that hold the clip on loosen after a few weeks, but they're easy to retighten with a small (1/16"" ?) Allen-wrench.The lip on the bottom of the blade makes it very easy to open with the flick of the wrist. When open, the knife feels great in the hand.For $15, this thing can't be beat."
4,Good for it's time,I like the things you can do with print shop. My computer crashed when I had it fixed the guy up dated and this version wouldn't work. He bought the 2.0 deluxe I really like it. The only thing is Hard to find envelope size for 1/2 card and 1/4 card. The old one no problem Strange because that is what all card sizes are. Also no address book in the new one. Had to buy separate Address Book soft ware.The old one had it with it. Other than that loved the old one and love the new one for making cards.
3,printshop 15,This is a good version of printshop but I have had to relearn because some things are different from the older version I was using. It would be good to know whether this version could have been used with windows 7 or vista before purchasing.
1,Regrets,"Regrets aplenty should you buy this book. The sentences are convoluted and have no whatsoever prose quality to it at all. Edmund Wee's style of writing is obviously more suited for academic or journalistic purposes. The storyline is slow and boring and predictable. I believe the writer wishes to be arty-farty, airy-fairy but fails miserably.I've read a lot of trashy novels and believe me, this is the lowest of the low.I would have given it zero star if I could."
1,Waste of money,Don't be such a sissy... Discipline your kids. Take the money you saved by not buying this book and treat your kids ice cream or something when they behave. A little free advice... If you're looking at this book because you're having a problem with your child just remember... Nobody respects a pushover. Your children are no different.
5,Could not put it down!!!,"I picked this up yesterday to start reading and could not put it down. I finished it in three hours - reading non-stop. All of Diana Kirk's books are good, but this one was the best. I thought I had had it all figured out, but ended up wrong. This author is one you can be confident of more than getting your money's worth of entertainment from. I don't even have to read a synopsis of a book - if it has either Diana Kirk or Diana Hart as the author I'll pick it up knowing it's going to be a good read."
3,Okay,"The starting gate doesn't hold the cars very well. Flag works good though to tell who won. But much easier to hold the cars by hand and say ready, set, go than trying to make the start gate hold the cars in place while you push the button. Back wheels unwind if you aren't super carful and cars are too narrow to hold unless you get them in there just right. Between the two there are more 'misfires' than not. Just easier to hold the cars by hand..."
4,An Album of Red,"Like Larsson, Peace takes the romance out of incest, sadism and murder. Unlike Larsson, Peace isn't slick. The brutality of his language matches the mayhem, and if you like that kind of stuff, which I do, Nineteen Seventy-Four should prove satisfying. I don't hold it against him that he's aiming for Chandler and fails, everyone does. Marlowe and those plots were noumena. There's one transcendent scene involving cops and gypsies that's worth the price of the book."
3,Buy the kindle version,"I made the mistake of buying the paperback version becaue it was less expensive (a strange decision by the publisher). If you plan on reading the whole quartet, do yourself a favor and get the kindle version because you will need to refer back to it. Flipping thru the paperback trying to find a character mentioned one or twice was a big hassle."
2,Bollocks!,"Heavy-handed. A high character count trying to make up for thin plot. Sophomoric use of brutality, incredibly dissapointing ending, endless use of 'period' Britishisms, fun but ultimately self-indulgent and pointless. Racist attitudes portrayed but never addressed. Try again!"
2,Akward First Effort,"Apparently modeled somewhat after Orwell's 1984, Peace's bookfails to offer much more than a bloody and bleak look at a series ofhorrific child murders and corruption in Leeds, England. As in Orwell's book, a young, idealistic and naive man (here a junior crime reporter) enters into an ever-increasingly brutal and nasty side of his surroundings. What motivates him isn't altogether clear, and whether he's an idiot, an ( ), losing his sanity--or all three--he's a far from sympathetic figure. Peace's writing is altogether awkward, he tries to hard to achieve some kind of flair, and plot threads. Yes, he piles on the cultural references to impress the time and place upon the reader, but the sheer level of brutality, and the body count makes it altogether silly by the end. Better luck next time. END"
5,All Around Great Film,"Folks, you can't miss with this movie, which has something for everyone. The great Jimmy Durante doing a few of his trademark songs. The stop-action Rupert the Squirrel. The comical ""villian"" Mr Dingle, who exhibits all the negative qualities that provide a great counterpoint to Jimmy Durante's positive qualities. While the movie is fulla laughs, there are a few truly sad scenes, such as when Rupert's original owner has to give him up. There's also a little wisdom in this movie, such as when Queenie McBride, who believes the money comes from Heaven prays, in vain, for more money. ""I guess God didn't answer,"" she says. ""Maybe he did answer--and the answer is no,"" replies Durante. Everyone in the family will love this one. My 5 year-old son recently took this for his afterschool class to watch and, after they got over the fact that it was in black-and-white, they really enjoyed it. You'll love it!!!"
3,Charming little movie,"I bought this same copy (same company, same cover) for $1.99 in 2007 at Kmart. It is classic black and white,released in 1950, and stars Jimmy Durante, Tom Drake (Meet Me in St Louis) and Terry Moore. I really enjoyed this movie (don't be fooled by the picture), but the sound quality and sometimes the picture was poor. I see no reason to pay $14.98 for this copy, when Amazon sells a restored and colorized version for $9.98 under the name ""A Christmas Wish"" !"
5,Rupet with Durante,This movie is an entertaining story demonstrating Durante's humor and entertainment ability A classic in film and fun to watch too
3,"Charming, funny, sometimes touching.","I have this movie in it's digitally restored, remastered and colorized version ""A Christmas Wish"". The skin tones aren't exactly right, but I like it better than the black and white version.It is a charming, funny and sometimes touching movie. The version I have also includes a commentary with Terry Moore, which funny and insightful. Tom Drake from Meet Me in St Louis is also in this move."
3,"Beautiful photos, but *NOT* a sourcebook","This book is filled with gorgeous photos of exquisite dollhouse rooms. However, I would hardly call it a sourcebook, since it doesn't mention the sources for any of the items or materials. Had it contained directions for making the projects, and/or information on where to buy them, I would have loved it. Instead, I'll use the photos for inspiration -- but certainly not as a sourcebook, since no sources are mentioned."
3,The Dollhouse Sourcebook,"It's an okay book, but there are definitely better resource books out there (even at the time this book would of been published).The main area where the book is let down is the photography, and there are a lot better photos of some of the work that is represented in this book, especially the work of Kevin Mulvany/Susie Rogers, and John Hodgson.As for the supporting research information, this is rather brief and generalized in some areas. Some of this information presented, both within the supporting information, and the photo captions is slightly inaccurate in parts as well. Would also of been nice, if the work was accredited to artist, with the caption.Might be better to buy a used copy, as it may disappoint."
2,Not heavy enough to lie flat,"There was only ""beans"" (weights) at the edges and the middle, so it just lightly rests against the door. I was expecting something heavier."
2,A bit fimsy,I ordered two of these for the downstair doors but neither fit the door perfectly (I should have measured). I think they are on the flimsy side though - it would be nice if they were filled with a more heavy material. Unfortunately my dog keeps mistaking them for his stuffed toys (same consistency) and stealing them from the doorways!
1,Lets see here... handwaving...,"ITS all wishful thinking says Susan Blackmore, a woman who has waged her career on this claim.Where is the evidence? Well, you see there is none. Blackmore wages her evidence on pink unicorns she says she is trying to abolish. In a true hand waving fashion, Blackmore dismisses ALL evidence for OBEs that could produce facts that were verifiable. This is coming from the same woman who is studying 'memetics' a non-falsifiable pseudo-science, and claiming it is scientific.Sure, if you're the ultimate non-believer, you will find hand waving here. But the truth is, you DON'T NEED Blackmore to do handwaving for you, because in truth, if you ARE a sceptic, you are quite probably a smarter sceptic than her, and can come up with better arguments.Poor."
4,Well written and thought out,I read this book some time back and found it a informative and well written. I consider it a great place to start for anyone interested in the workings of the human brain.
1,Wishful Thinking......,"First of all, Dr. Blackmore is a psychologist. Psychologists have a very limited knowledge of the brain and how it works, compared to physicians like Dr. Moody, or especially neurologists, like Dr. Morse. Secondly, other books on the subject were published by non-biased companies. This was published by the materialistic-biased Prometheus Books, so the buck stops there. Finally, this book is grossly out of date, since more reseach has suggested these experiences are indeed real. It's an intelligent book, but it's still wrong."
3,is the 'supplement facts' label correct....i am wondering,"I have been doing some research regarding the nutrition details of desiccated and defatted Argentinean beef liver.My findings have led me to wonder if the B12 and Iron amounts on the label of this product may be a typos, especially the Iron.I have sent a few emails to the company asking for clarifications, but no replies so far.It would not surprise me if Iron was 2.8mg (not 28mg) per serve and B12 was 100mcg (not 1000mcg) per serve.A label typo may not be that far fetched; I noticed the front label reads `Dessicated' which i believe should read Desiccated (1 s, 2 c).I hope to hear from the company soon. If i do, I will update this comment."
3,Natures LIfe Beef Liver,"They are hard to get down so I break in half. I do not have a blood problem and wanted to try them. Have not had my blood work but these seem powerful. For those with Anemia , they would probably be great."
5,Great Stuff,"Not easy to swallow, but considering the benefits of getting it down, I'm not complaining. No stomach troubles with this at all. Taking for anemia, already feeling a difference after a couple weeks."
4,A Family Odyssey,"""I Promised God"" was a moving and heartfelt journey for me. The author's visually descriptive and intelligent writing style kept me riveted and yearning to experience more of her story.My partner and I were reading the book at the same time, and for several days it was our main topic of discussion. The book definitely initiated significant inner contemplation as I joined the author and her family in this turbulent, tragic, tender, and inevitably uplifting and soulful tale."
3,An old man's favorite glossy anecdotes,"I believe Fanning wrote this when he was 70. It's a kind of ""greatest hits"" collection of his favorite anecdotes. He must have used some of his journals to give these stories detail.It has quite a few excellent illustrations of the given ships and south sea locales.The enthusiastic description of the wholesale massacre of south-sea sea mammals is truly stomach churning.He didn't really discover much of anything, so the title is, no doubt purposely, misleading.His descriptions of a how he got out of a couple very tight spots by virtue of his relation to an uncle who was a British general and governor of Newfoundland was pretty nauseating, too.The anecdotes are too upbeat to be completely believable, especially his descriptions of the complete healing of a number of severe burn victims on his ships.Overall, kind of an easy-reading waste of time."
4,bunny puppet,I received the little bunny rabbit puppet in a very timely fashion and in excellent condition. It will be a great addition to the puppets I use to teach French songs in class.
5,Super cute and life-like,"My 17 month old daughter got this for Christmas and she loves it. She often brings it to me so that it will play with her. I love that you can use your whole hand to move the head and all 4 legs at the same time. It is life-like when you do that. It is very soft and snuggly, which my daughter loves. I don't think it would fit well on my husband's hand, so I would consider it small for those with larger hands."
5,The person I gave this too loved it.,I would recommend the hand puppet to anyone that likes soft fluffy things. Very nice hand puppet for male or female
4,It's very detailed,I like the product. Exactly what I expected. Very Helpful for studying for the LSAT w/o paying a lot of money for a class....
4,Great Buying Experience,"I have been looking at all the bookstores in the Atlanta area for this book. I needed it to study for my upcoming LSAT. The book was out of stock everywhere in Georgia. I simply went online to Amazon and the book arrived at my doorstep within 3 days-and it was cheaper than the bookstores! This book is an excellent tool if you are unsure about the logic games portion of the LSAT. I would recommend it to anyone, even if they feel pretty confident on logic games."
4,Pretty good,"Best games technique book on the market, I must say. The glossary in the back of every game ever is especially useful.I will say, however, that if you've taken a course, namely Princeton Review's Hyperlearning, it's pretty much the same stuff. However, if you don't plan to take a course and want to buy the best games book, buy this one. It's expensive, but next to the price of law school, it's almost nothing.It is a little thinner than I was hoping. For $60, I can buy at least twenty practice tests. That said, I would recommend going through this book and every test ever published by LSAT."
2,Keep your eye on the clock!,"While some of the tricks are useful, others just make things more confusing. The game setups took a long time and although they sometimes worked OK, more often than not they really slowed me down. Even worse: I only finished half the logic games section before I ran out of time. I do NOT want this to happen when I take the LSAT.I've found some of the other books take simpler approaches which are far easier to learn. That's where I would spend my money."
5,Incredible!,"When I started studying for the LSAT, I was getting 10 or 11s on the Games Section (about a 50%). I went through this book and did everything it said to do, and wound up getting only one question wrong on the actual test.I would recommend this book to anyone who is having trouble with some of the more difficult games questions."
2,Disappointed,"This book was labeled as in good condition. That is not the case at all, the front and back cover were completely trashed. The book is falling apart on the outside as well as has disgusting food particles that I have had to clean off. Inside the book it only gets worse. Every page is scribbled on and it is impossible to erase it all without taking away the actual text. I am completely disappointed and will never buy from them again."
1,Buyers beware!,"From personal experience, I strongly caution anyone from dealing with PowerScore.I bought two books from them, Logic Games Bible and Logical Reasoning Bible. During shipment, my plans changed as I decided not to take the LSAT. Upon receiving the books, I called PowerScore and asked for a refund. They informed me that absolutely no refunds on books are given once shipped. Needless to say, I was disappointed to hear this. I don't remember seeing this on their website, yet it is posted but it is not obvious when buying online and checking out. Most, if not all, reputable retailers will refund your money, usually within two weeks or 30 days of purchase. I believe PowerScore is not a reputable retailer. Refunds for items mistakenly bought or not used is a valid ""consumer protection"" policy. PowerScore does not abide by this policy. I will not do business from any vendor that I believe is not reputable and PowerScore falls into that category. Buyers beware!"
2,Why bother?,"The Logic Games are the easiest part of the exam. They are the most simple and objective (compared to the utterly contrived reading problems), so why bother?"
5,Wonderful! -It should get 7 Stars,"This book literally added 7 points to my score(Pushed my score from the 160's to the 170's) If you take the time to learn the system and practice the drills you will be faster and more accurate at the games. The drills are based on old tests which makes the book cost more, but the exposure and analysis of the old games is well worth it. I suggest starting to use this book about 2 months before the actual test so that you will have time to truly internalize the method. Best 50 bucks I've ever spent. I'm recommending it to all of my friends. Good luck!"
4,A worthwhile purchase.,"When I first started studying for the LSAT, I could finish all of the sections on time except logic games. This book costs a lot, but it simplified the different structures and helped me a great deal. Now I'm correctly answering all of my logic games.The downsides are that it has as lot of superfluous terminology to classify the different types of games, while offering relatively few actual games to practice with. (If you're looking for oodles of games to just get in that rigorous practice, check out ""Ace the LSAT Logic Games"" by Get Prepped.)Still, I would definitely recommend this book; it is a good, informative buy regardless of how little or how much you've begun to study. To not waste time and energy, I would just advise ignoring information that seems irrelevant to solving the games themselves."
1,BAD BOOK,"Five Words of Advice: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! I've read my share of books on the LSAT, and this is absolutely the worst. I feel that people would be better off buying any other book on this subject. I am a bright, nimble individual, quick on the uptake, and I read books on logic games and LSAT questions because I find them stimulating and enjoyable. Most of the time. In the process of reading this particular book, however, I felt as if my brain was being wrung out like a mop. The goal of such books should be to help people think clearly and score well on the LSAT, not to muddle their thinking, not to twist and tangle the fiber of their brains. Lord, it was painful for me, but I read this book all the way through, and I'm just thankful my wits are still intact. I'm slowly recovering from the ordeal, and as part of the healing process, I am writing this review so that others might not make the same mistake I did."
1,Don't buy this unless your LSAT is lower than 150,"Ok, I can see how this book can help somebody who has very limited logical mind. If you are comfortable with logics, it would be far faster and easier to figure out the games in your own way. Try solving the old test problems and you will definitely find your own best diagrams to solve them efficiently. This book can even slow you down by making you follow the given steps which, I think, is a waste of time for those who can find their easiest way themselves."
3,Great Resource,This book is a terrific way to boost your ability to handle the logic games on the LSAT. The strategies in this book are far more effective than the strategies in the Kaplan review.
1,This book did me no good.,"If you're no good at logic games I don't see how this book can help. I carefully worked through all the chapters but when I got to the end absolutely nothing stuck. I was very depressed when I got to the questions on page 201 and couldn't get any of them done. I had to keep referring to the answer section to help me through.I reason I give this book only one star is to balance all the overblown ratings it's gotten. If it were just my own review I'd give it three stars - you do get a lot of good advice on how to work these games. But if your brain's not built for logic games it just won't respond to the training.Of course, I've only been working at this for about six weeks. But still - NO improvement? I score very high on IQ tests so I know I'm not dumb. I just can't do these logic games very well. Before and after this book I'd miss about 14 of them."
1,Not Very Helpful,"I bought this book as well as the Powerscore Logical Reasoning Bible. The Logical Reasoning Bible was excellent and extremely helpful. On the LSAT I took, I got most of the Logical Reasoning questions correct. However, I found that the game book did not nearly prepare me enough for the LSAT. When I was in the test, I could not figure out any of the games and guessed at all 22 questions. Had I done better on this section, I would have scored really well on the test. I would suggest either supplementing this book with another book, or researching and purchasing an entirely different book."
2,There are better books on the topic...,"This book is just okay. There are a lot of examples of how to improve morale at work, but the writing isn't that great, and the book isn't very well organized. There are much better books on the topic...try Managing to Have Fun by Matt Weinstein or 1001 Ways to Energize Employees by Bob Nelson."
5,"Excellent book, literally hundreds of usable ideas","I used post-it notes to mark each page that had a good idea that I could implement, and I must have marked over 100 items. This is well worth the money. I am now trying to get Barbara to come to our company and kick start our ""Work can be Fun"" program."
1,A bit light...,"Although the author's heart is in the right place, this book is little more than a collection of often disjointed suggestions for ""regenerating spirit at work."" Sometimes self-serving, and often sickly sweet (see, for example, the two entire pages devoted to the ""Red Plate"" -- a special saucer imprinted with the words ""You are special today,"" that the author gives out to her favored clients), reading this book is kind of like chewing a cheap stick of gum -- the flavor just doesn't last."
5,Regenerate with Humor; Read WorkLaughs,"This delightful small book skillfully shows you how not to stress out at work. Another way to get a perspective of your job situation is to learn to laugh at things that stress you out. WorkLaughs:Quips, Quotes, and Anecdotes about Making a Buck can provide you with the laughs to do just that-- from job interviews to meetings to dealing with the boss, WorkLaughs will show you that all aspects of the job can be a laughing matter. (WorkLaughs is also available on Amazon)."
3,Not bad for the remanufactured price.,"The headphones work well, sound great, and fit comfortably. I wear them at work 4+ hours a day.A few minor issues:The charger for the battery currently in the headphones doesn't always work. The prongs tend to bend inwards, causing the connection to be lost. I've found that using a paperclip to bend the prongs out every few days works well.Sometimes if I pause my music and then start it later the headphones don't pick up the sound. I have to turn them off/on to get them working."
1,IMPORT AND DOMESTIC VERSIONS ARE THE SAME,"don't spend twice as much for the exact same 2CD. The domestic version of this release is also imported from Blue Rose and sold through the domestic Innerstate label. It's the exact same thing as this version being sold as an ""import."" Don't cough up 2x as much money to get the same thing. Caveat emptor."
5,Recently unearthed gem!!!,"If you like/love funk, GET THIS WHILE IT'S STILL IN PRINT!!!!Eddie is the absolute GODFATHER of Funk/Rock guitar!!! Bow down before the ""Bookend"" of Jimi Hendrix. I think it was George Clinton that said Jimi and Eddie were talking about working together... MAN, that would have been a killer collaboration!!!"
5,W O W !,"This was playing on the speakers at the local record store. I bought it right out of the CD changer. Every listen blows me away. From the overall sound quality to the incredible quailty of the songs, this is a highly recommended treasure."
2,Deja-vu????,"I have read JAK's trilogy attempt and have found the three novels to be variations of the same theme. I was looking forward to reading about Rafe Stonebraker, who seemed to be the most mysterious and sexy of the trio, but was disappointed with the same old, same old. Not to mention the fact that the characters in ""Orchid"" were strangely unsatisfying. They just didn't inspire that magic feeling; with each other, or with me."
1,A great disapointment,"As a real fan of JAK, I tend to buy her books no matter what. But as in all her latest books, I found once more the same recipe as in her previous ones. I don't think I'll waste my time anymore."
5,Another WINNER!!!,"I loved it!!!! Ms. Castle further developed the world of St. Helens which she created in Amarallys and again her characters of Orchard and Rafe were wonderful.I hope that Ms. Castle will contine with this series and further develop this world or perhaps a special book about their (Amarisllis,Zinnia,Orchard) children?"
2,She is a HORRID girl!!!,That girl should just shut up and mind her own business because not everyone loves this doll as much as her!
3,Definetly not the best,"Usually, i am one to judge a doll too fast. But ive seen this doll almost every day and now ive come to my conclusion: This doll, is definetly not the best one in the ""Pretty 'N' Punk"" collection. To be perfectly honust, i prefer Jade. But that is my opinion. There are several things MGAE did wrong with this doll, and i am in the mood to post them, so i will: The hair is orange w/ red streeks, making her look very ugly, and definetly NOT punk, or pretty. - none of the colors go together, and the hairstyle is rather odd. If i were you, i wouldn't buy it, even though it is on sale. I would buy one of the others. Any other ""Pretty 'N' Punk"" doll, just not Meygan."
2,Meygan often shines like a star but what HAPPENED?!?!,"Meygan is sooooo beautiful with her auburn hair and her off the hook ferious fashions but this Meygan looks like she's come out of the my scene closet!! Her face, her hair, her clothes,her make-up all look so.......snobby!!! Why was she made like this????????????"
1,"This Doll is a copy of the scence lindsay lohan doll that,s my opoin","I think from the pics she looks just like the my scene lindsay lohan doll. that,s just MY opion."
4,Para los amantes del estilo celta...,"este recopilatorio no debe faltar. Es un album en que se pueden escuchar las más preciosas baladas jamas escritas con ese toque celta que me encanta. Sin lugar a dudas, haya algunas canciones que las prefiero originales como en el caso de ""When you say nothing at all"", pero hay otras que sorprender lo bien adaptadas que están y que incluso las prefieres a como normalmente las oyes. Mi canción preferida es la 8 ""Baby can I hold you"", muy melodiosa y dulce. Cuando pueda me compro el album primero, porque seguro me gustará."
2,WHAT A BUMMER,"Loved SOUL MOVER. A 5 star effort that really rocked and was full of monster hooks. Even the somewhat inane lyrics couldn't detract from the music. The inane lyrics are still here, but the hooks have gone AWOL. Still some rocking moments, but no memorable songs on this one. It almost sounds like they are trying way too hard despite having entered the studio without any worthwhile tunes. I would recommend that you stick to SOUL MOVER and give this one a wide birth."
3,I'm Always Interested In A Glenn Hughes Album!,"He seems a bit less pumped up for the material this time around. He's had several releases now with a clear head if I remember correctly. He's a badass singer as always but I've felt he had more fire for the material in previous albums. I'd recommend ""Soul Mover"" and ""Songs In The Key Of Rock"" or if you don't know his band from the seventies ""Trapeze"" you may find the album ""You Are The Music We're Just The Band"" interesting."
4,Music for the dedicated.,"Glenn Hughes truly is one of the greatest musicians / singer/songwriters alive and this album shows yet again another dimension to his abilities to write great music that always surprises the listener. I must say however that as much as I love all Glenns work this album is certainly self-indulgent ie: it really is an album for Glenn and for the dedicated Glenn Hughes fan. It is not as ""mainstream"" for want of a better word, as some of his more recent releases. On the label it states ""career defining album"". Does this mean the critics think this is his best work to date? This marketing cliche shouldn't apply to Glenn because everything he does is just so good - Yes this album is different but so was Return Of Crystal Karma. The problem with Glenn is that he is such a prolific songwriter and his style / moods change from album to album it's hard to choose a favourite."
3,"Well done, but not my holy grail","For my money, the Hughes-Thrall album released in 1980 or 81 is a timeless masterpiece of power pop. Hughes' voice is rich and full, and Pat Thrall's guitar playing is, well, enthralling. Why this terrific album sank like a stone, I have no idea. Drugs, contract brinksmanship, prima donnas? Whatever, the fact that these two never again recorded is a music industry tragedy. I keep looking for that sound, the incredible songwriting and the passionate intelligence of that album, but this one wasn't it. The musicianship and voice are fine, but it's a letdown for me."
1,Professsor of Law & Finance,"This has to be one of the worse novels I have ever read regarding our financial system and its environment. The plot is non-existent and the characters shallower than a puddle in your driveway. The financial aspects are poorly covered and hardly recognizable to someone with experience in financial jargon, and hopeless for the average reader.This is a novel that never gets started. Mr. Erdman may have tons more experience with Wall Street and high finance than me, but even as a lay person, I kept waiting for something to happen; even something that would make me feel real suspense........it never arrived. I read the recommendations (which were basically pretty good) prior to buying it, but boy was I disappointed. I have never written a negative review, but I felt like my money had been stolen."
2,Best Seller????,"I've just finished ""Zero Coupon"" and I'm glad I can now move on to something more imaginative. I found myself reading this book so that I can finish it and pick up my next novel, not because it was interesting (I hate to leave anything unfinished). This could have been a much better book if the author had taken the time to give depth to his characters. It seems that he was more interested in establishing the scams and explain high-finance, which was interesting; however, the writing that put the story together left much to be desired. This very well may be the worst book I've ever read!"
3,There is something wrong with the plot,"It was a fun book, but there is one thing wrong. When one issues a zero coupon, they issue at a deep discount (such as a dollar price of 10 cents on the dollar). So, why does the subject in the book receive THE FACE VALUE of the bond? He should only have gotten.one tenth of that. Still, I am an Erdman fan."
1,It depends on what you are looking for,"I purchased the solution manual for one of my students, hoping that it would help her with the even number problems. But it has only the answers to odd numbers problems. If you are looking for help with odd-number questions, it will help you. Otherwise it's only as good as the answers at the back of your textbook."
4,A towering figure,"When Eugene Wigner died a few years ago, we lost another towering figure in twentieth century physics. His contributions are probably equally well remembered by physicists and chemists, especially in the field of spectroscopy, where he published a seminal text on using the theory of discrete groups to analyse data.But this book of his recollections is not about his scientific papers, per se. Rather, the most interesting sections to many readers will be the times that he lived through, and the other major figures that he knew, like Dirac and Einstein. The book goes through the turbulent and terrible years of the 1930s and 40s. Thus, you can see the development of quantum mechanics and his involvement in it during the 30s. At a time when the key ideas in this subject were rapidly discovered. Then see the development of nuclear fission and the Manhattan Project through his eyes, at the University of Chicago campus during World War 2.An excellent book for a general audience."
3,Hooded(?) dustpan,"Works well ... Disappointed that the ""hooded"" feature was not a complete closure upon carrying.Use for back yard cleaning with a dog in the house.."
3,Pretty much what you'd expect...,"getting two great King Diamond albums Abigail and Fatal Portrait. Abigail is most likely King Diamond's definitive album and shows him and the band at their best. As with all the KD albums, the storyline is the best part and Abigail has a haunting classic story that will definately keep you listening to the whole album. Fatal Portrait isn't is good as Abigail but has it's moments and is a good album with a creepy story. The reason I gave this package 3 stars is because the CDs didn't come with the lyrics which was a disappointment."
3,"""The table is set for three...""",Another pathetic excuse for Roadrunner to try to make more money off a band they barely tried to promote when they had 'em under their wing. I give it three stars for the band and music. But this release is superfluous as most fans already have these albums.
3,Quite Faithful to the Book,"This animated adaptation is quite faithful to Leroux's novel. The animation is very reminiscent of the 1980's filmation style, so if you grew up with that sort of thing it should be okay. The acting isn't great, and the animation is done on the cheap, but it is well worth the watch for any Phantom ""phan."" On a side note, you don't have to buy it on VHS anymore you can pick it up in this collection on DVD here:Greatest Tales Ever Told"
1,Gives pain in the eyes,EEEEEWWWWWWW!!!!!!WHAT HAPPENED TO MY FAVORITE BRATZ CHARACTER???????????????????SHA LOOKS GROOS IN ORANGE I THINK.SARA SIBLINI!!!MY SCENE LOVER!!!BRATZ LOVER!!!*FOREVER*
5,I love the orange legs,"I think it is cool. It is a nice color, and she is very pretty. I have her and she is great. Get her."
1,Oh. GAWD.,"Must. Have. Cataract. Surgery. Or learn to read Braille. Are you people blind? Because if you're not already you will be after you look at this Bratz. It looks like someone ingested the sun and threw it up all over this doll. ALL. OVER. IT. Not to mention she only comes with one outfit, and your money could be oh so much better spent on something less visually SCARRING. Not worse than the magenta and aquamarin Yasmin, though. That thing is just an ATROCITY. But I digress, you like it, you buy it. Just as long as I don't have to look at it.Muja,Centra"
4,Prudes dressed this poor Cloe,"I think MGA paid too much attention to the idiots who enjoyed venting their own repressed sexual fantasies on the Bratz dolls as this Cloe looks like she is going to a meeting of the audio visual club at school. She still is a pretty doll and will , in true Cloe style, be wonderful in other outfits. they also skimped on her extras here. I know she was a regular line doll but it looks like they made her cheap for Big Lots . buy her and get her a good dress FCOL"
2,Looks cheap,A like bratz a lot but this one looks very cheap. i guess its a good deal for 10$ but buy another one. I LOVE the other bratz dolls but not this one. It looks like those cheap dolls u buy for a dollar at a dollar store.
1,"BLURGH""",EWWW i lyuv bratz n evrythin but this doll is ugly!!! She looks so cheap n nasty n y r her legs painted ORANGE!!!!! I kept this cloe but i never touch her there is a 1st time 4 evrythin n this is the 1st time a cloe doll has been ugly!. I hate her so much grrr lolpeaceemma xxxxxxxxxxx
4,Perfect for Worship,"i picked up this inexpensive acoustic/electric for playing at worship. I've owned electric acoustic guitars in the past and was very excited to find a slim roundback guitar that has good, reliable and consistent sound. It sounds good with or without the amp. The strings that came with it were a bit 'horsey' so I replaced them with lighter/brighter strings. It's quick to tune and holds tune well in inclimate weather.After three months, I decided that I like it enough to get rid of my electric guitar altogether. I'll probably upgrade to a more expensive version from Ovation -- I like it so much, I'm kind of wishing I had bought one of the upper-end models now."
3,Good one,"I'm a student who isn't native english. Consequently, I need sentence example it don't provide to understand profound meaning of words. Anyway, it can satisfy me."
3,Not Great. Maybe Helpful for Middle School.,"While this device is certainly sturdier than its competition, it is also less useful. The database just does not contain enough of a vocabulary for an adult reader, student, or researcher. You will often find that the terms used in academic or intellectual writing are just not covered. This dictionary is suitable for students of the middle grades, but not for an advanced student or a competent high school student. The vocabulary is just simply lacking.The contrast is good. The speaking voice is acceptably clear--not great, but clearer than other machines with better and bigger vocabulary databases.It is also a bit clunky. A real annoyance to carry around.Overall: Too big on the outside. Too little on the inside. Do not buy, unless you are buying for a younger learner."
5,"It's still worth to have this electronic dictionary, in spite of on line dicitionaries.","This is my second Franklin dictionary, the first one I bought about 20 years ago, and it still works properly. The display and the sound aren't as good as at the beginning, but... no wonder! I purchased a new one because it's so much easier to have a very good dictionary (thesaurus!) with one single touch, so small, by my side all the time... I'm familiar with many on line dictionaries, but then, you need a computer, and you need a connection, and you have to wait to all this things to start... I prefer my Franklin. It's fast,complete, light and easy."
4,"Sorry, if its not in the Dictionary...then this can not help","I purchased this item with the goal of being able to speak names of places; however, it is limited to only its dictionary. If its not in the dictionary, then forget it. Once I discovered this, I returned the item before use any other functions. I was going to keep it given that it appeared useful, but the unit was too big. I am considering buying another unit that is smaller, but I know the new unit will also not be able to read names."
2,Very 'basic' translator,"Unfortunately I don't like because it don't expand, then I cannot use other cards with other language like spanish, portuguese, etc.By any more money you can buy other new models that accept the expansion cards."
3,"Nice product,..terrible customer service.","I have this particular product and like it very much. However, over the years I have purchased from Franklin many times and there is one thing about Franklin that is consistent and which I can't stand and that is their approach to customer service. Believe me, you don't want to have to deal with such terrible customer service. As each year goes by, I'm more and more amazed how a company with such poor customer service stays in business. Regardless of the merits of the product, it would be impossible for me to recommend dealing with Franklin."
4,it is a language master!,"it is a good investment. the upside of it, convenient, quick, handy, and you can use in your entire life...however, the downside of it, i don't enjoy the digital pronunciation very much, it is not scaleable at all, which normally palm and other ebook gadget offer, and it is pretty big in term of size, you cannot put it in your pocket."
3,Considering Ancient Secrets of the Horses Mind.,"While this book contains valuable information, it is not by any means a thorough text on the horses mind. It contains some controversial advice. Too many stories and too much personal information for my taste. The Ancient Secrets of the Horses Mind is big on promises but falls short on delivery. Recommended as a training supplement only, not as the only book you get on training the horse."
5,This review is for the original release,"Loved this CD when it was released as an album back in the day. Slap the headphones on and listen. What a powerful CD, what a group! The only other group I could think of with this much energy playing rock is Living Color. This CD STILL sounds fresh. Heck, even my sons like it. They never imagined that I was young once and could appreciate rock music. Little do they know! If you have only heard the radio version of Time Has Come Today - then get the CD and crank the REAL version. Who cares what the neighbors say - you won't be able to hear them anyway. The Chambers Brothers are right up there with any group out of the 60's - but they transcend the years and the music still sounds 'modern' and in actuality sounds a lot better than much of the stuff that is being played today."
5,"Great CD, love the combo of up-beat and ballad",Definetely reccomend buying this CD. The title track song Home to You is a beautiful balland that really makes you think about what is important in life-As a frequent business traveller this song really hit home South American fan living in Jersey
4,John Michael's best in a while,"This is John Michael Montgomery's best CD in a while. Some great uptempos and some terrific ballads. My favorite track is the title track, ""Home To You""."
4,earring jackets,"These are small jackets, but the diamond studs are small, so they are perfect. They really enhance the diamonds. I had been searching for jackets and was thrilled to find gold jackets that were both affordable and not so large as to overwhelm the studs. While their small size would make them useful for a youngster, I'm well past that stage in life and they work fine for me, too."
3,"Cute, but a little cheesy","As an avid Simpsons fan, I wanted a photo album of the Simpsons family. I thought it would be spiral bound, but it was not. It has many pictures from Homer and Marge's baby years, which have not been shown in the series as far as I know. There are some pictures of Homer and Marge's senior prom. However, at some points, I find it ""cheesy"" and not as funny as the series. So, if you are looking for the Simpsons humor, don't buy this. If you want pictures of the Simpsons family and a collector's item, buy it."
1,Now Subtract One Star ...,"Bad. As a novelty collector of CDs by all-girl groups, I took a chance on the CD single of B*Witched as an experiment. Experiment failed. This is the most juvenile (instead of youthful), childish (instead of childlike) schlock of bubblegum that sticks to your brain like a tumor. The ridiculously wretched ""B*Witched Go to the Moon"" takes the cake, and while the actual *songs* are slightly better, one wonders why some corporate stooge in a stuffy office signed these girls to a record deal. Their looks? Sure. B*Witched is an insult to anyone's intelligence and is so bad, they make Barney look like Shakespeare. Next to B*Witched, the Spice Girls are the Beatles. It's that bad."
3,NOT on THE SAME FISHER,"Don't know too much about this particular band... But it's is certainly NOT the FISHER from the GREAT EXPECTATIONS CD. Some reviewers, should be more accurate before telling their opinion of vocalists, and limited knowledge."
2,"Professional, Commercial, NO Passion","There's lots of competent musicianship here but I keep waiting to hear the passion that the blues signify for me. The tunes are occasionally catchy but otherwise these songs smack of covers of songs that have been made more palatable for a mass audience. The originals say a lot about the African-American experience, this album appears to eliminated most of that identifying emotion. There is more soul and passion in John Hurt's Corinna, Corrina than in this whole album. I don't hear anything ""natch'l"" and I don't hear the ""blues"". If this album turns others on to wanting to hear authentic blues, then it will have served a purpose, otherwise it's just a precursor to someone like Keb Mo."
4,Beautifully made,This rooster comes in very handy at the public library where I work. The kids love him. The only drawback is his beak is doesn't move and you need a small hand to manipulate him.
4,pretty...BUT A BAD ROLE MODEL!!!!!,"ok,first of all, i like meygan and i want her badly!!! but WHAT THE F**K? she should not be dressed like that. dolls should be role models for kids and have perfect clothing examples! not be dressed like prostitutes! barbie would be better for kids age 6-12. not bratz! i love bratz, and my friend geraldine has this and loves it, but changed her into capris because of the way-too short skirt. i like bowling and i want to get her. but overall, she looks like a prostitute!buy a winter one or a fully-clothed bratz doll instead."
5,"Meygan is struttin her way 2 the top Or,should I say BOWLiN` her way 2 the top!","This doll is so cool!I`m so glad that they are making more Meygans because I like Meygan.Her hair is so pretty!It looks like it`s crymped red with a touch of highlights.Her eyes are the same magnificent aqua as the wild wild west Meyan with horse.i don`t own this, but I own the wild wild west Meygan.She has fusha pink cloths and cordinnating lip stick and earrings.Her bowling ball is leopard print(so tottally fab) and her bag is so cute!She also has a fusha comb and trading card.I hope you vote my review helpfull.I hope you had a good day!!!"
4,"Quoth the Raven, ""How stereotypical.""","I once read a review of these sports Bratz dolls of a young girl that said, ""I love these dolls! GIRLS CAN PLAY SPORTS TOO! GIRL POWER!!!!!!!"". Yup, girls can play sports too, as long as they're wearing hot pink, miniskirts and are using stylishly coordinated equipment. I'd just like to say, don't take this as someone supporting feminism. Bratz. Aren't. FEMINISTS. They're stereotypical valley girls who MARKET themselves as feminists. Occasionally.Now, all this flaming is not to say I don't LIKE the doll. She's quite cute, and I like her outfit, but two questions, for all you bowling vets: When was the last time you went bowling in a MINI skirt? And, when was the last time you used a LEOPARD PRINT BOWLING BALL? These sports dolls are cute? Yup. Affordable? You bet. Realistic? GOD, I HOPE NOT.By the way, what's up, Fulliem Quach?The Raven"
5,awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!! duh!!!!!!!!,"hey peepz when u write a review ur supossed to write about the toy or whatever it is.ur not supossed to write about this weirdo fulleum quach!(or whatever his name is)and if u want to write about him that much u should at least write about him a little then talk about the toy or whatever it it.any1 who ha8es this is SUCH A LOSER!!!!!!!this doll rocks!!she has BEEEEEEEEEEAUTIFUL redish-brownish hair,adorable makeup(i like her lipstick the most),and awsome outfits,and even more!!!every1 should totally buy this cause it totally rocks!!!!(duh)and u better not h8 it !!!!!this better help u!!!!!bye!!!!!"
5,I wasn't talking about you,"I was talking about Kinsey. SHE is the jerk around here. I hate My Scene dolls, and love Bratz dolls. My Scene dolls suck, they are ugly and slutty and dumb. Bratz dolls rule, theyb are gorgeous and great and awsome. I was talking about kinsey, not you. My Scene dolls suck, and Bratz rule."
1,A book meant to misguide naive people,"Islam is by far the most misunderstood religion in the world today thanks to centuries of medieval-style propaganda successfully peddled by bigots and Christian zealots. Craig winn continues this tradition in grand style with twisted scripture and out-of-cotext quotes.The author is not after the Truth, he is just attempting to stop people from becoming muslim. Islam is the fastest growing religion in the US and in the world, despite these feeble attempts (this includes the propaganda concerning women, the persecution of Christians, and terrorism.....the people who are accepting Islam in greatest numbers are women.....and the religion from which most converts come is Christianity). The primary source ie the koran is always the best reference."
1,This Book is Doomed,"An anti-Islam manifesto written by a Non-Muslim who probably calls himself a Christian, with a determination to find every possible quote from the Qur'an (Koran) that can be used to paint the religion in the worst possible light; a similar treatment of the Holy Bible, taking partial and complete passages out of context, hasn't been done yet, but imagine the uproar in the Christian community if such a book were done; it also begs the question, ""What version of the Qur'an was used?"" As a Christian I find Mr. Winn's book a vehement, hateful waste of paper and ink, and I am not a fan of Islam. I respect the basic human right of freedom of religion even when many Muslims would just as soon I and my religion disappear."
1,Pathetic Hate and Propaganda- The 5 Star Reviews are a Joke,"This is the most pathetic piece of flith i have ever readI am a Muslim and have been one from birth. I am 15 years old and I think as a true Muslim, I know the REAL meaning of Islam.The stupid man that wrote this book will burn in Hell and when he does I will laugh at him.This is all propaganda and lies. This person knows NOTHING about anything to do with Islam, yet wrote a whole book about it. I'm a Muslim. If I wrote a a book about Christianity, would you belive any word of it? Its like trying to ask the KKK to educate you about African Americans. (whom I love and respect)It all comes down to lies.This book is full of it and will only succeed in confusing you. If you want to know what Islam is really about- ask an imam. Ask a scholor.Unfortunatley everything you read these days isn't true.This is the most extreme example of that I can find.Islam only preaches love and equality.Please Remeber that and please don't buy this book"
1,Based on fictions and not facts.,"I am a historian, I read this book and in my opinion the writer had only one thing in mind, take advantage of what is happening in the media to make a profit.This book is poorly written, anyone who knows anything about history would find this book a disgrace.The author is insulting a Man who has been described in many book prior to the 911 tragedy as one of the most peaceful man who has ever walked on this earth.I do not recommend this book to anyone, please give your money to a charity, it will be of a better use.Thank youJames"
1,Hate,"This book is unfair and promots hatered and racism against muslims.For a website like amazon, I think they should stop selling this book."
1,Unbelievable,"From brief readings online of this book, the author simply cannot take an objective view of any other religion due to his Christian fundamentalism. On checking his referencing, some of his quotes from the Koran are simply wrong. No context is placed, and he translates Jihad to violent warfare, where Jihad means struggle. This is only one of the numerous false assumptions made. This hate-filled book cannot promote the understanding needed between the West and Islam in these crucial times!"
5,Good Story,"This story, because i say story i mean it's all fabrication made based on the author (name not worth mention) narrow, hate filled mind need i mentioned lies. This has no credential and he knows it, if you think otherwise tell him to publish it on a journal of history. I know, he knows and those history guys know it, it aint going anywhere cos it's all crap. This book should only to be RECCOMENDED if you need a NEW DOOR-STOPPER. He has no concise arguments that holds up (dnt blame him his afraid of the truth)or make any coherent thought. He reminds me of a rabid dog with hatred frothing out of his mouth. To tired to enlighten people. If you want the truth go and find it, if that means going to the four corners of the world do it. I rated it 5 star cos to make you read my comment. Oyeah his a poor lier."
1,HA! What a liar!,"I am quoting this from a search on yahoo.com""Coward Craig Winn on the runCoward Craig Winn On The Run ! Craig ""The Coward"" Winn, who wrote a silly little book called Prophet of Doom has refused the challenge for a public debate on Islam. ... and misrepresentations would be uncovered in broad day light. Craig Winn is only willing to do some kind of weird paper ...www.examinethetruth.com/craig_winn_exposed.htm ""also Mark Welch had interesting views of Winn check them out for yourself http://www.markwelch.com/perspective/good_and_evil.htmand www.examinethetruth.com/Craig_Winn_Busted_lying.htmm"
1,"As an Arab, Muslim and a Woman....","Well, I understand how people want to know about Islam and think Winn knows a lot about it so ""lets read his book"". Fine. Read his book, of course you can! but please, don't think that by reading it you will get the know Islam. Why don't you read what ""Bernard Shaw"" or ""Voltaire"" said about Islam? They did talk about it a great deal but I guess you are surprised to know that! A good writer is the one who can put his/her feelings aside when writing about other religions. You can't hate Islam and expect people to believe you when you say ""Well, I know the true meaning of Islam"".To summerize all this, this book is very offensive to all muslims but if you want to read it do so, just know one thing, it is not Islam what you are reading about.Thank you."
1,cheap,"the book is one of the worst unprofessional, untalanted works i have ever read. No hard facts, only generla views of uneducated people. Facts are right, interpretation is wrong. Advise to the author, u would be better off az a pizza delivery boy, leave books for real writers."
1,WRONG,What Craig Winn writes is gibberish. Islam is a peaceful religion. He twisted stories about Islam and verses of the Al'Quran. Craig Winn is a deliberate liar.
1,It's all fake,"I'm a muslim guys. Born and raised in New Jersey. Yes that's right, and I can tell you honestly all the quotes that are in this book are fake. It's all propoganda. Please don't buy this book, it's all a scam."
4,Get it free why to buy ?,"This is A very very good book every Muslim should read this book first then read ""Tarikh e Tabari"" then read ""Sirah"" by IBM e HishamFeel free to verify anything any fact given in this book with Tabari , Sahih Bukhari , Quran . Also no need to buy this book , this is available at author's site free with free audio. Now the only bad thing about is it has been written from a christian perspective however even if you are agnostic like me and deep study in Islam , it is a good book."
1,Fabrications and lies,The book is nothing but a compilation of fabrications and lies about Islam from a bigot islamophobe. The amount of misinterpretations and twisting of truths is phenomenal in this book. The author has a clear agenda to mar the true image of islam
2,"Too bad, it has Craig Winn's words too","The material in the book was eye opening but Craig Winn was able to write in such a manner that I had to skim a lot and was constantly annoyed. He writes in a manner so hostile that no wonder nobody will take him seriously.I have never seen an author so uncharitable to the opposing view. He sets up plenty of straw man arguments and then tears them down. He nitpicks every minute detail to the point where you wonder how strong his case really is.Many of his arguments can be used also to discredit Christianity if he really thought about it.Nonetheless, reading the Islamic texts is frightening and enlightening. Too bad Winn introduces the stuff in such an unprofessional way.Skip this book, and get one with a more academic tone."
3,2ND GENERATIION GARDENER TO KINGS,NOT A VERY LIKEABLE CHARACTER BUT THE STORY IS AN INTERSTING PERSPECTIVE OF EARLY ENGLISH AND AMERICAN HISTORY FROM A GARDENER'S PERSPECTIVE.
1,A Man in a Midlife Crisis,I was not pleased with Earthly Joys and this book only serves to further disappoint me. I think the book could have been much shorter if the main character could have dressed in gold chains and bought a corvette. I think Philipa Gregory has a script for her books and the last two did not bear out well under that script. It is clear as the characters get further from court they get more boring and weak.This character sailed back and forth from the Jamestown Colony at whim and to serve himself. The book split between the two locations watered it down to boringm and weak. I could have heard more about Jamestown or more about Cromwell's reign.
2,Follow-on,"I read this because I read the first book and wanted to find out what happened. Overall I thought this book was not as good as ""Earthly Joys."" I realize that it's fiction, but the story was sufficiently far-fetched that I thought it was too fictional."
3,"Philippa, what is happening?","Phillipa became one of my most sought after authors after reading the juicy and wnderful Other Boleyn Girl. Followed by Queen's Fool, I was hooked, chasing bookstores for her next delivery of her next book. Since then, I have read The Constant Princess, Virgin's Lover, Earthly Joys, Wise Woman, and Virgin Earth. All these are 3 stars at best.The writing is no longer rich with descriptives. Plots become unbelievable and basic. There is no longer much historical reference in these, making them feel like 'supermarket novels'.Very dissappointing, since after Anya Seton (Katherine may be the best England/Historical novel yet), she was my favorite historical writer.It feels like her publisher is pushing her to cough up a new book every year and the writing feels strained and rushed. She needs to stop and smell the flowers and let the historical imagination flow again."
2,Virgin Earth - Bummer Book,"This will be the last Philippa Gregory book that I will read. The prequel, Earthly Joys was good but in the sequel, she has destroyed the characters. It was a bummer. One bad thing after another and the ending was the worst. She took the man's son we learned to love in the first book and made him into a man with no character, who ran from every hardship and left his wife and kids to rot alone during a war. She made his grandson a psych show and married his teenage daughter to a 50 year old man. No happiness in this book. No smiles while reading it. I put the finished book down and my shoulders hung lower all day. YUCK."
2,Boring!,"If you are panting for an in-depth history of the final years of England's Charles I or if you desire to be bored to death with 660 pages of one of the wimpiest, most dysfunctional males who ever lived, then this book is for you. There is no way three intelligent women could have loved this jerk. The only reason I gave it two stars is for the lovely description of life in a Powhatan village.Read all of Anya Seton's books instead; they are far superior. Or ""City of Dreams"" by Swerling. Now THAT is historical fiction at its finest."
1,VirTgin Earth,"I was extremely frustrated with the length of time it took for this book to be mailed. I specifically chose a seller in the same state so that the book would come before the second book in the set so I could read them in sequence. However, it took so long for this book to arrive that I read 3 to 4 books in the meantime while waiting for its arrival. I wrote to the sender inquiring as to the length of time it was taking, with the reply that it was ""still within the required time limit""... yes, at that time it was, by one day. It took anther FIVE DAYS to arrive. Very poor selling technique, especially when sending from the SAME STATE!!! I will avoid this seller in the future."
4,A brilliant sequel,"Thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Earthly Joys. Brought history alive and gave a different perspective to the usual court intrigues. Great, strong characters. Would certainly recommend it."
2,Earthly Joys,"Not my favorite , too long with not enough action.. Although did have a great ending. Found it t be boring for several chapters."
2,Disappointing for Gregory fans,"I plowed through the Tudor series and loved every minute of it. I've since read the Wideacre trilogy and the Virgin Earth trying to get more of the Philippa Gregory magic. Blech. All 4 books are predictable with flat, largely unsympathetic characters. I'm not sure why these two series seem fascinated with a forbidden sex angle: incest in the case of the Wideacre trilogy and compulsive (lusetful but loveless) sex between men in Virgin Earth. Save your money."
2,Not really electronic enough,"Let's put it this way. This is more Jazz then electronic/ambient. I was expecting a lot from this CD after hearing numerous songs of the hidden gem Astralwerks mix sampler cd Werks Like a 12 Inch, as well as a few from a friend. This was a massive dissapointment, and is one of those cd's that probably is best served by me giving it to my mother. Jazz isn't my thing, and that's what the great majority of this is."
2,Odd album out,"I'm a pretty big fan of Spacetime Continuum, and I loved loved loved Alien Dreamtime, Sea Biscuit, and Emit Ecaps to death. I looked forward to this album eagerly, but when it came out, I was really disappointed. While there are a few good tracks on here, mostly it is rather boring and poorly constructed. This album is definitely not worth buying new; pick it up used if you're a completist."
5,mesmerizing,"this is the only album by STC i have bought and i love it. it may seem a little dull the first listen, but listen again. it is a very jazzed up, soulful, chilled out ambient experience. it even has a lot of live instruments that make it stand out from other electronic music. i highly recommend this album to any music lover."
2,Not Impressed,"If you want to read two tons of wording and come away with a pound of information then this book is for you. Most of what he says is intuitive. I am in the process of working with and developing a risk assessment format for some new products. I have picked this book up a couple of times,(giving it a second chance)but end up just putting it back on the shelf because it is ""empty"". I like books that are practical."
4,Barbra in the late '60's: determined and defensive,"Streisand charges through this 'modern' album of messagey pop songs with fervor, but seems oblivious to the flowery arrangements and orchestration(and maybe a little defensive OF them), which are distinctly stuck in 1963. Still, the uneven continuity aside, the idiosyncratic performances can be a hoot and the record probably sounds better today than it did in 1968. The cover shot(Barbra imitating Coco)is a wild bit of pop art, and Streisand herself is in good spirits; she's game for anything, as ""Honey Pie"" shows, but sometimes her showmanship and energy are misplaced or misused. B+"
3,What About THAT Voice?,"Barbra's tentativeness in singing ""new pop"" music is evident here. Her preference for traditional arrangements, along with an ""eclectic"" selection of songs, shows this album to be exactly what it is. . .the greatest talent of the last half of the 20th century attempting to become ""fashionable"" by appealing to an increasingly different and younger audience. The above is offered not as criticism of Ms. Streisand's voice or singing. If anything, this period was the beginning of the period where her vocal abilities were unquestionably unsurpassed. For this reason alone, the album is a worthwhile investment."
2,Her attempt at being hip,"I'm a huge Barbra fan. Her voice is radiant and stunning (the best perhaps of all time, opera singers excluded). But this album, from the songs, to the cover (which makes her look like a 50 year old rich debutant) does not showcase her talents.Her voice is good here, as always, but she seems removed from the music, and she sounds like she simply doesn't get what she's singing, which is very unusual for her. After a string of ""trying to be modern"" records, she gave up and went back to the 1985 Broadway Album, which won her the acclaim she had lost. She needs to stick with standards."
4,Don't miss this great album,"This obscure album with it's truly awful cover put me off for far too long, so it took a while to get around to purchasing it. Boy, was it worth the wait. For fans of Streisand's golden era - 60s to mid 70s - this is a must have album. It marks a transition between her past (Broadway and standards) and her near future (the pop-rock `Stoney End' and `Butterfly'). But `What About Today' is far more than a curiosity, and has become one of my favourite Straisand albums. Highlights are `What About Today', `Ask Yourself Why' and the oddball `Punky's Dilemma'. `The Morning After' gets very `Butterfly'-esque. Even misfires: `With A Little Help...', `Alfie' and `Honey Pie', still have value due to her unique take on the song or fine vocal delivery. I could have lived with out that `Little Tin Soldier' however...Don't let the scary cover put you off (I turned this cd cover backwards - there's a decent pic of her on the back)."
4,Late 60's Vocal Peak In Evidence,"Barbra's vocal talents were in full, glorious bloom on this set released in `69. Although she enjoyed an incredibly long vocal peak (1963-1981), she was certainly at her greatest heights in the late sixties and early seventies. Barbra's vocal range has never been showcased better than it is on ""Goodnight,"" ""Alfie,"" and ""Punky's Dilemma."" Other songs are average but interesting time-capsules. However, Barbra's version of ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" borders on mockery of that Beatles song (Do I denote a hint of jealousy? Certainly no need to be jealous!)."
5,WONDERFUL BARBRA,"""What About Today?"" What a good album. This album reminds me of my high school days in northeast Florida. Great lyrics and tunes. ""Wish I was an English muffin,"" or ""Kellogg's Corn Flake."" If Barbra does it for you, this is a must classic."
2,Not what I was looking for,This NIA tape did not provide the workout experience I hoped for. Too many beating drums and rapid pounding rhythms. I prefer the soothing music with constant motion.
5,Love Nia,I love the nia workouts!! The body flows with the music and it is an exercise in listening to the body and letting it direct you. The music of this dvd is a bit primitive and it is so easy to move to. The warm up and cool down leave you well relaxed and feeling good - also feeling like you have had a good workout. I find this workout easy to come back to.
1,Nia video,Cheesy program....not worth the DVD it was burned on.... Had I watched this when it first arrived I would sent it back.....
3,The Monkey God Comes Alive Animated,"This is the adventures of Hanuman, the monkey God from Ramayana, the Hindu epic. The program is in Hindi with English subtitles.So much work is put into this, but the effort did not pay off. There are other similar animated programs from Hindu epics and mythology that have been done extremely well. But in spite of the great colors and selection of some of the best stories, the spirit is missing here. May be there was no need to cram in this many details. Some of the curious information, like the way Hanuman's son was born, are adjusted to the child viewers' understanding.Nevertheless, the colors are wonderful. Over 20 colors have been used on each character and 20000 individual images were created during the animated process. Artists worked hard for two years to bring this program."
1,"disappointed,","I got this to try and eat healthier. I steam rice per directions and it took 3 times longer than the book said. Then after that I tried to steam eggs to hard- boiled, after the 18 minutes recommended in the book I tried to take an egg out and it cracked and egg was everywhere. I let the other eggs steam for an additional 20 minutes, and they still weren't hard set. The fun part was trying to scrub the egg off of the plastic with the holes in, it took me the better part of 30 minutes.I don't know whether this is the way all of these units are or if mine was defective. I sent it back. I may try another brand. I liked the taste of the steamed rice, it was done to perfection, but it took a long time to get there."
2,Mold,"This product would have been one step up from the previous generation of Oster steamers if it weren't for one very major flaw.Good Points:-it's inexpensive-the electronic timer works really well (this was the new upgrade from previous models)-it's versatile especially for Asian cooking-it works really fastBad Points:- MOLD the steamer's water inlet, that also serves to help you measure how much water is in the steamer, is a great way to collect mold. Currently it is nearly impossible to dry this inlet completely without pushing a qtip or tissue through; and no, turning it upside down doesn't help since the inlet's curves are designed to keep water in. Cleaning this part is also near impossible for the same reason. This is just really stupid.Oster should spend more time testing their products. This should have been fixed before being released."
5,oster 5712 steamer,"Vegetables done perfectly. Very easy cleanup, all parts dishwasher safe. Highly recommended! You can't go wrong with this steamer as a gift or for yourself."
5,Versatile Appliance,This has been very useful for our family. My two daughters are vegetarians and my husband was recently converted to eating vegetables to keep a fit and healthy lifestyle. This steamer just came right into the picture at the time that I needed it the most. It has various options and settings that would work well with my vegetarian family for tons of different foods. I have had this for about 2 months with a lot of use and it has held up great.
3,Great product if you do not mind buying a new one every year,"We steam most of our food and we purchased this because of the size and the reviews. The steamer is great for veges and similar softer items but takes forever on rice, etc. The life of this product is about 1 year. When the first one gave out, we purchased the same steamer again, due to the fact that we have not found another one that has the space or the speed for veges. We did have to get a separate 4 in 1 steamer/cooker due to the fact that this does not cook rice well. I would love the manufacturer to make this product more durable. At this point, I would be willing to pay more, if the product would just last longer than one year."
4,Simple and effective,"Great, easy to use product. It is nice you can cook either frozen or thawed food in about the same time. Meals take under 30 minutes to make and come out tasty and healthy. If only it would clean itself...but the dishwasher safe plastics make most of the cleanup a snap."
4,Love it!,"Love the new steamer and the fancy features it comes with. The Error mechanism when the amount of water falls below a certain level is great! Also like the fact that it is transparent. A good addon would be an extra container for rice. An ability to give the aroma of the spices would also be welcome. PS: Have not used it extensively, so can't comment on durability or sturdiness. Have owned for about 3 months now."
4,Fantastic steamer!,"This is our second Oster steamer, and we are very happy with it. It's extremely convenient to use and it's much easier to clean than our old model was. I have only two complaints, and they are very minor. When the steamer is finished, the timer bell is a single quiet beep which is quite easy to miss. On the other hand, thanks to the keep warm function it's not as if the food is going to burn or get cold. We usually know how long the food is going to take anyway. Also, the cooking times printed on the steamer are not accurate. Although certain fresh vegetables are supposed to cook in 15 minutes, we find that it takes more like 30. All the same, we are very pleased with the steamer and would buy it again."
3,Plastic may not be safe,"The plastic that holds the food is made from Polycarbonate. If you look at the plastic containers it has the number 7 along with the letters PC. I just read a consumers reports article May 08 on the dangers of this plastic especially when heated! This is from the article: ""Some studies showed adverse health effects from exposures of only 0.025 microgram per kilogram of body weight per day, yet a polycarbonate bottle with room-temperature water can leach 2 micrograms of BPA per liter.I'm putting this on the shelf until there is more information on this plastic."
1,LOVE the idea...,"I really wanted a steamer! So when I received this one for Christmas, I was so excited. Until, that is, I examined it further.It's made w/ a #7 plastic (usually polycarbonate), commonly found inbaby bottles, microwave ovenware, eating utensils, and plastic coating for metal cans.Reason why it's BAD: Made with biphenyl-A, a chemical invented in the 1930s in search for synthetic estrogens. A hormone disruptor. Simulates the action of estrogen when tested in human breast cancer studies. Can leach into food as product ages.I called Oster and spoke w/ a supervisor, and specifically asked whether he could confirm the product was BPA free. He could not. He also told me to do what I would like w/ the info he gave me - either keep and use the appliance, or return it. I'll be doing the latter."
5,Outstanding,"I am a firm believer in amazon reviews as I think real people's comments are more reliable than manufacturers' promises. I actually picked this up at Target before coming across the amazon review. I made an incredible dinner tonight- Snow crab and scallops with broccoli and cauliflower. I am single and often find it pointless to cook big dinners for myself. With the steamer it was so nice to just portion out just enough for one and it is so easy. Just put your food in the baskets and walk away. It'll beep when dinner's ready! This is one of the best products I have bought in ages. Don't sacrifice nutritous, amazing dinners just because you are cooking for one! Worth every penny and so easy to clean- much easier than a Foreman Grill."
5,Simple & Easy to Use,"Great steamer. I've used it regularly for several weeks now. One downside, since its made of plastic, it stains. I steamed some seasoned crawfish and the water reservoir wall is now stained light red."
5,YOU NEED THIS!,"I bought this item mainly because I was tired of cleaning a pot after boiling rice in it. This guy not only makes perfect rice every time, but has revolutionized the way I make dinner. Except for my grill, this is the most valuable cooking tool I own. I make everything in this steamer because it's convenient to use, makes perfectly cooked, healthy food, and is very easy to clean and maintain. I've owned this same machine for three years and have had no problems. Includes a small book with cooking times for many different items, but anything you normally sauté or bake can pretty much be steamed, just use your imagination. Has a timer feature so you can set rice up in the morning, and have it cooked and ready to go when you get home. Also has a `keep warm' feature so if the steamed goods finish before your other dishes, they stay hot until you are ready to serve. I very highly recommend this model!"
3,Older Version Better,"This steamer was purchased to replace an older one of the same model. The replacement Oster 5712 has cooking chambers that are made of much thinner plastic. Also, the new Oster 5712 shuts off when the water level drops below the ""low water"" line. When cooking food for a long time, you often have to watch the steamer so you can add water through the outside inlet to keep the cooking going. The older one didn't require this attention. The ""keep warm"" function has been retained in the newer model. The ""egg"" shaped design of the steamer and the ability to stack cooking chambers on top of each other makes the Oster 5712 a good choice."
4,Great all in all!,"Love this product overall. There are certain food items though that one needs to cut up so that it gets cooked by the steam within. If you don't cut it up, the inside portion remains raw and uncooked. Still it is a great product. Easy to clean as well."
5,Food steaming is the way to go,I've become extremely health conscious with the foods I eat and how they're prepared. Getting a food steamer was the next logical step for me. Using the convenience of a microwave comes with problem that it destroys most of the nutrition in the foods. For my health and moreso for the health of my kids I had to get this and it's been a great investment. I can't recommend it enough. I have it out on my counter and whenever someone comes over we talk about it.
1,My Bucket's got a hole in it.,"This is a dual purpose steamer, while steaming your vegetables, it is also leaking water all over your countertop.So one has to wipe up the the large puddle of water after each use, resulting in steamed veggies and a sparkling clean countertop."
1,Oster steamerI,"I had a Oster Steamer, in fact I've had two previous, the first one lasted close to 15 years, the second one five or 6 and would still work if I had not dropped the lid and it smattered into tiny pieces. No big deal I ordered a new one through AMAZON and it came from Sears. The new one IS NOT WORKING AND CLICKING ON AVAILABLE ACTIONS brought me ""not eligible to return"" since when is a bad product not eligible for return? I paid $59+ for this and it took several potatoes over three hours to steam and they were still hard as rocks. I would NOT recommend anyone buying this and Incertainly don't ever plan to purchase anything else ever from SEARS."
4,Nice Steamer,As mentioned in other reviews the water reservoir doesn't drain completely so using some sort of suction device to remove the remaining bit of water is a must. I followed the instruction of 5 minute steam for spinach and it was too much. I took it down to 2 minutes and the spinach was fine. The rice bowl works well. I steamed brown rice for 43 minutes and it came out fine. It is easy to clean and the timer with a keep warm feature is great.
5,The Perfect Steamer,"I have had this steamer for 5 weeks now. I have used it many times over the past few weeks and I absolutely love it. I mainly cook only for myself so this steamer will work for small meals or larger meals. I've fixed many different dishes in this steamer, Vegetables, BBQ Chicken, Shrimp, just to name a few, and so far everything has came out perfectly. Very Easy Cleanup as well. I would highly recommend this steamer!"
4,"you get your monies worth, does it's job well, but the plastic is not forever.","was inexpensive compared to most others, but don't wash it in the dishwasher too often...as it will deteriorate over time.This is my second one the last lasted 5 years then crumbled."
4,Steamer,It is a nice steamer at a good price but it appears to be a little cantankerous about the water level. My last steamer had a fill mark and you never neede to add more water but this one runs out a lot. It also seems to take longer to get things done.
4,very good steamer,"This steamer works very good. I've used it for both vegetables and making rice. It takes some time to learn how long you want to steam different items, but works well."
1,This item was broken when I used it for 16 days.,"I have just bought this item on September 29, 2008. Today (October 15th), when I prepare dinner, I discover that it was broken. The display screen went blank and stopped working. I'm really disappointed."
2,Oster Steamer,"I am very pleased with this steamer. It cooks quicker than a previous steamer which I owned, which was not an Oster product. I especially like the ""keep warm"" feature."
1,Using # 7 plastic (not good),Good product but using plastic # 7 Not safe. Good design and features. I would buy this product if it was used with a BPA free plastic.
4,"Steamer Great, Parts ???","This is my 2nd steamer and they work great. However, the bowls deteriorate after a year or two and need to be replaced. More durable plastics would produce a better total product."
5,food steamer,this food steamer is a great buy. I use mine at least once a week for all kinds of meals. Purchased a second one for a Christmas present. And as always purchsing from Amazon is fast and simple and delivery is always on schedule.
4,Great Steamer,What more needs to be said. I had an old black and decker and upgraded to this when I moved. Its even easier to use and much bigger. Only knock is that the auto-warmer seems to kick on even when you dont want it to
4,Awesome small appliance,"I got my steamer yesterday and it is awesome. I would recommend this toanyone. It is large enough to be an effcient, regular used item andwow! no messy pot to clean. A+++ Highly recommend. I plan to give theseas gifts in the christmas season."
2,"Works great, but CONTAINS BPA","This is a great steamer, and I was so happy with it until I discovered that it is made from number 7-PC plastic, which is the worst kind of plastic and contains BPA. I suggest you steer clear of this steamer, since BPA has been known to leach into foods when that type of plastic is heated."
4,Good quality steaming machine,"This is a good quality steamer with simple easy to use buttons. The power is good for what I needed (veges and fish) and is similar to steaming using your pots on stove, except steam comes faster using this machine.The disadvantage is that the containers are made from plastic (easy stain)and there is no control on how much steaming power you want to use."
3,Oster 5712 Electronic 2-Tier 6-Quart Food Steamer,"Product is great, functional & serves its purpose. The only downside is that the metal part at the bottom of the steamer needs to be really scrubbed otherwise, it will develop sediments."
4,good steamer,"We really like the steamer, the timer and ability to add water, plus the warmer feature are really nice compared to old steamer we had. My husband and I really enjoy using the steamer and use it often,"
3,Disappointed with the replacement,"I purchased the manual timer model (like model 5711) originally. We used it for many years, and it gave excellent service, but the plastic had begun to crack at several of the vent holes. We decided to splurge on a new one and upgrade to the 5712 model. While it still cooks fine, we are EXREMELY disappointed in the product quality compared to our older model. The bowls are much thinner and feel flimsy. They actually flex to the touch. The top is thin as well. The cord is significantly shorter too, which means I am limited as to where it can be placed. If you are replacing an older unit, take these facts into consideration before you buy. The new one does cook just as well as the old one. Finally, I would suggest that anyone who buys this may need to adjust the cooking times to suit their tastes."
3,"Not bad, but a little slow.","If you load it up, it takes an hour to do what my Black and Decker can do in 30 minute.But the timer is the feature I was after and it works nice."
4,Pretty Good for the Price!,"This product does its function pretty well, although it takes a while to get to the optimal heating temperature, and as such food being prepared takes a bit longer than anticipated. The thing I like the most is that the product is actually quite large, much larger than it appears in the pictures you see on Amazon. As such, you can fit quite a big feast worth of steamed food, usually ready in less than 30 minutes.The biggest gripe of this product is that the support manual only provides recommended time setting support for a limited number of foods, and no support at all for East Asian cuisine (which heavily makes use of steaming systems)."
5,Oster Steamer (electronic),"After receiving one as a gift I have purchased four more for gifts. It is easy to use, food comes out perfect, and is easy to clean. It is good for people who don't want to use salt, it's not necessary, vegetables taste great. I have made sliced apples in the rice steamer that were delicious. I have also made rice. No boiling over like on the stove. It is also easy to clean."
4,Nice Item good capacity,"Oster 5712 Electronic 2-Tier 6-Quart Food SteamerWe had the regular size steamer for years and it still works good, but this one can do two things at once and keep them from mixing together.This has many additional options like using one or both levels,We found another handy feature if the timer goes off, it will kick in every few minutes to keep the stuff warm.Nice size and quality.Great buy"
4,steaming,Nice steamer - very easy to use. Made samon & veggies 1st time out - (the day it arrived) wow - steaming good. 2nd time did chicken and veggies impressed with the ease of operation.
3,in storage,did not use. can not steam carrot or any hard vegetable properly. take a long time to steam than the traditional stove.
1,56 DAY WONDER,BEST STEAMER WE EVER HAD -- FOR 56 DAYS THEN IT DIED -- RETURN PERIOD EXPIRED -- NOW HAVE OSTER FLOWER VASE
1,don't waste money on this!,I bought this steamer after reading all the reviews and found the negative ones to be accurate. This steamer never got hot enough to heat the water! I tried to cook eggs and they just sat there. I ended up returning it and purchased a west bend and love it!
4,Great steamer - painfully dim LCD timer,"This thing steam vegetables quite well and I'm rather happy with it. I only have one complaint - the little LCD timer is almost impossible to read. I have to keep a flashlight by the steamer to see how many minutes I've cranked into it even when the bright overhead kitchen light is on. The angle of illumination from an overhead kitchen light does not provide enough contrast to read the LCD. So, unless you have really, really good eyes, I'd recommend going with the almost identical 5711 modelOster 5711 Mechanical Food Steamerwhich has a mechanical dial timer instead of an electronic LCD."
5,Never knew this product existed but now use it every day!,"Who knew?? The best feature for me is that it turns off when the set time is finished. You don't have to be in the kitchen and turn the gas off at the right time or risk running out of water and burning the pot. I love that you can steam eggs to hard boiled and the shells come off so easily. Vegetables are done perfectly too. No more having to use heavy pots and pans. Just rinse the container, pour out the water and put away. Be sure to put in an accessible place as you will find yourself using all the time!"
5,A Good Steamer,This steamer does an excellent job especially the double steamer because you can do two different types of food at the same time. It is great for healthy eating.
4,Absolutely wonderful!!,"I bought this to use because I didn't want to spend the big bucks on a steamer since I also use a slow cooker, along with the stove. It's a perfect item to have for steaming veggies and the egg boiler is great. I love the texture of chicken breast when using the bottom tray. Also, it does keep food warm for quite awhile, so need to worry about pushing a reheat button or anything like that. I'm not too fond of the rice cooker, especially for long grain rice. If you have a rice cooker, use that instead. The only true downside is cleaning the bottom tray. When you steam chicken, all those holes sometimes make it hard to clean the fat and excess that like to stick in the indents. Otherwise a great product."
2,Worked for 7 months,"The steamer worked fine for 7 months then quit. It would have been nice if they had spent an extra fifty cents & backit the LCD screen so you would not have to turn on all the lights in the room to see it. I have used it 15-29 times in 7 months & now it has quit. I will look for a different one as if you don't have a dishwasher for the steamer plastic bowls it is hard to clean as food gets in the holes. I am not talking about the base as that does not go in the dishwasher but is not hard to clean the base, only the bowls."
1,Not recommended!!!,"I tried once then it was broken! Luckily, amazon gave me the full refund after I returned deficient product. It's not durable at all. If you really want to buy, be prepared that it won't last long."
5,Great Product,"My daughter has one and I purchased this based on her experience. I have since used it and love it. Easy to use, easy to clean."
2,Difficult to clean,"I'd love to keep using this product, but I can't because there is no discernible way to clean the water inlet. This is the clear corner of the unit where you can see your water level. Because of the way it is shaped inside, turning it upside down does not remove all of the water. Turning it on it's side doesn't work either. The two holes for pouring the water through are so small there is no way to clean out all the mold that has accumulated in there. Unfortunately, I have to toss it."
1,"Steamer worked well, but shoddy workmanship","I've owned this steamer for nine months now, and used it regularly.The steamer has never gone through a dishwasher, or been subjected to any corrosive agent or high temperature, other than those produced by the steamer itself.Yesterday, the steamer's rice dish and one of the steaming trays cracked, simultaneously and in several places, apparently due to heat related stress. This is unacceptable for a steamer.while it does steam foods nicely, I'd suggest looking harder to find something built to last."
4,Oster Steamer,"Oster 5712 Electronic 2-Tier 6-Quart Food SteamerThis was a replacement for a vegetable/rice steamer that we had had for 16 years. It was a new learning experience as on the previous steamer the time was determined by the amount of water you put in and it shut off when finished. With the Oster steamer, you enter the time, which is determined by the item being cooked. Once you fill the container with the water, it has to be watched so the level does not go below the minimum level. Water can be added without opening the steamer which prevents getting scalded by the steam. A nice feature is you can stack two trays and steam 2 different items at the same time. Another nice feature is you have the ability to set the time of day that you want it to turn on."
2,My steamer is no 5 stars,"After using my steamer a few times, I've come to the conclusion that either it's defective or my expectations are way off base. The food takes so much longer than the stated times. My hard boiled eggs cooked for 45 minutes and still weren't done. I'm so disappointed, especially after reading all the positive reviews. If I hadn't thrown the box away, I would return it."
4,oster 5712 electronic 2-tier food steamer,"Love this product, just wish I had purchased a larger capacity machine. But well worth the price."
5,Steamer,"This steamer works fantasically! I had a similiar prior to purchasing this one, that had worn out after years of use. This product is easy to use and is even easier to clean. The foods taste fresh. I would definately recommend this steamer to any one interested in healthy preparation of their foods."
1,Piece of crap!,"If I could give this thing 0 stars I would have! Malfunctioned right out of the box. Kept alarming ""low water"", but it was full. I had such confidence in this that I had thrown the box and receipts away. It went directly into the trash with the box!!"
1,don't buy this,"Don't buy this rice cooker from Amazon. When it breaks they make returns very difficult.Mine broke after just 4 months and Amazon basically said - ""Oh too bad for you""."
2,Broke in less than a year.,"I purchased it in July of last year, followed all directions, and only used it once every couple of weeks on average.After 8 months it powers on but no longer heats up.While it worked it was amazing, makes cooking a cinch!"
3,Food steamer,"This product is worth its price, nothing more. Pastic container is easy to clean but too small. It is good only for vegetable products rather than fish or other entree items."
3,didn't live too long,"We got our first Oster steamer from Amazon in July 2009. It saw almost daily action until it suddenly died in November 2010. While it was alive it worked really well and was very convenient to use. Despite the frequent use we never had any mold issue as described by others and we certainly didn't go overboard cleaning it, simply rinsed it out and let it dry upside down. Since we liked the functionality we decided to give this brand another chance and just ordered a replacement. Hopefully, it will live a little longer than the first."
3,Too Slow for Rice - BPA free,"A great product but when cooking either jasmine, basmati, or brown rice, it takes forever. And by forever, I mean around 55 minutes.If I'm steaming rice I can only steam one other item and dinner usually always consists of rice, veggies, and protein. So the protein gets thrown in the toaster oven, no biggie.When taking the lid off you have to use potholders, and keep the lid perfectly level or all the water from the steam will drip into your food. So far I've been successful. It's also a little difficult to take the bowl out of the steamer as there's not much room between the handles and the outer steamer when you have potholders on.Much less work to clean than conventional cookware, yay!I called and emailed Oster to ask about BPA in the steamer bowls and was told in both instances that there is NO BPA in the bowls!"
2,A real shame...,"I initially was not sure how much use I would get out of a food steamer so I bought this product because it was well-reviewed and affordable. But in the three months or so that I've been using it, I've gotten a lot of use out of it and I credit it with eating healthier overall. So why the low rating? Well because it just died on me for no reason. I didn't drop it or submerge it in water or anything like that but it refuses to turn on nonetheless. Otherwise, it's well-designed and did its job admirably (just not long enough). Since I'm now hooked on food steaming now, I'm sure I'll buy another food steamer, albeit one with a better build quality."
3,"Just bought one, few thoughts and questions?",We bought one and it is easy to use. Plastic does smell like food no matter how you clean them. Stainless steel cook ware has no smells.MY CONCERN is how safe is the plastics heating up at this hot temperature. Consider all the problem with BPA scare and Plasticizer leach from plastic???Any well inform folks out there??
2,IT WILL BURN YOU REALLY FAST,I have owned this for about two years and it's nice to cook multiple items. There is a major SAFETY problem by not putting a handle on the top of the lid to open all the steam escapes at your fingers and you can get burned really fast. Also if you have really hard water it will need to be cleaned with vinegar often. It has stopped working after being used once every couple of weeks.
4,It's fantastic,"It is fantastic to own this steamer. It runs fast and hold enough to feed three or four people. However, it smells bad due to the plastic materials which is used to make the products. Hopefully it is not bad to health."
3,Unsafe plastic,"Good steamer, but it's made from unsafe plastic #7 (bisphenol A) that supposedly leaches in heat. While I've been putting my food in safe plastics and ceramic dishes to avoid contact with the plastic, I wonder if BPA fumes are a concern.... I'm currently looking for a BPA-free steamer. Do any exist?"
4,Karen,"The only complaint I have is that the steamer didn't have instructions about the water level for different foods. I know from using my old steamer (not the same brand) that some foods have to be cooked using the high water level and some use the lower water level. Since this one did not have it in the instructions I am having to guess at it, other then that the steamer works awesome."
1,Useless and Disappointing,I bought this after reading the reviews but I am totally Disappointed by this item. I have hardly used it for 3-4 times and it's dead. It wouldn't even power on and manufacturer's customer service is crappy..They don't even have their own phone no..Way to go..
1,Leaks,"I had an older version of this before that died due to extensive rusting in the circuit below the heating element. So, I ordered a new one- the item works but water leaks all over from the tank in this unit even when it if filled up to the right level or lower. Very disappointed."
5,Steamer,"This product is great. Wore out my last steamer. This one has a lot of newer features-digital timer, two baskets and a rice cooker. Counter space saver!"
4,2ne one only lasted a year,"I am ordering my 3rd 5712 Oster steamer. The first one lasted about 5 years; the second one only a year. Same problem both times - the switches stopped working so they both lost power. I really like this steamer but am rather annoyed that I have to order another one. If the 3rd one goes, I'm asking Oster to replace it!"
4,Works great on most,"I haven't tried any fish, chicken, or seafood yet, but I've steamed several kinds of fresh and frozen vegetables. They've all worked great except mushrooms. I'm very happy with the quality, ease of cleanup, and ease of"
1,Horrible implementation of great product,"This product is Wonderful and Terrible. It's extremely frustrating that it isn't better implemented. As many are trying to increase their intake of fresh vegetables, this product makes it so much easier. The downsides are - It appears to be made with a polycarbonate plastic which contains BPA and I'm assuming it contains that. The other complaint is that the water reservoir leaks all over the counter. I'd be thrilled to pay $80.00 for this product or more if it were just made better. The timer and keep warm features are great. Vegetables have never tasted so good or been more convenient. Please fix this and increase the price."
1,awful,"This is the worst Danielle Steel book I've ever read. The plot is so ordinary and predictable, even Melanie's daughter getting an abortion couldn't spice this story up."
3,Changes,"I am sorry, I read so many books and being 84 years old I don't retain the book after this length of time. I am sorry....Katy"
1,Big Dissappointment!,"I thought this book would never end! I forced myself to finish it because I kept telling myself that it had to get better, but it didn't. The writing is sophmoric and repetitive and the storyline is very predictible. The main characters were very unlikable... Mel is a wimp and puts her needs and the needs of her step-children above the needs of her own children. Peter is a selfish, self-centered chauvinist, who has time for everyone else but his children. The only reason I would want to be around him is if I was having a heart transplant! It will be a long time before I read another Danielle Steel book!"
5,Legendary!!!,"I love these albums. Since I wasn't used to listening to 90s Death Metal, It seamed a little flat but the more I listen to it, the better it gets. I understand how these albums were so legendary in there time. These albums are extremely creative and brutal Death Metal from NY. Now I listen to more 90s Death Metal."
2,"Crappy re-release, but SUFFOCATION f*@!ing rules","When I heard that these two amazing albums were going to be re-released, remastered and put onto one cd, I was very excited. Unfortunately, it's not worth the money. If you are a Suffocation fan, you probably already own these two albums.The packaging of this CD is downright pathetic. The insert does not contain ANY lyrics or any additional pictures. In fact, the insert is downright worthless. As for the sound... I cant tell the difference between this CD and the original version. Seems like a money grab for the record company. I would NOT recommend picking this release up."
4,XS - but still too big,"Wells Lamont makes durable, well-constructed work gloves. I used to purchase 2-3 pairs every year. I just wish I could STILL find these in Women's Small. These Men's XS are still too big for my hand. I've been searching for 3 years and still haven't found a satisfactory replacement. PLEASE, Wells Lamont, make Women's size small again. Gardening gloves just don't work for me, I need durable, well-constructed WORK gloves."
1,not worth it,"Its a shame. Pretty, but horrible antenna, you can't add a better one, no forward or reverse on the cassette player, feels like it'll fall apart at any moment. Back to Target it goes."
1,Terrible Everything,"The first Crosley Musician Entertainment Center I bought had broken speakers. Once I returned that one, I got one that worked for a little while, though it was never able to play CDs that others had burned for me. After a couple of months, though, it stopped playing any and all CDs; then after a couple more months the turntable stopped routing sound to the speakers. So after less than a year, all that worked was the radio. Very disappointing product."
4,It was a interesting book...,"I enjoyed reading this book since it seriously bought me and my boyfriend closer together...there were lots of description (thank god!) and clear pictures to go along with the descriptions so we had no problem understanding. Not only do they offer wonderfully illustrated sex positions, they also offer advice ranging from how to stimulate yours and your partner's 5 senses, it also gives you so much advice how to please yourself along with your partner! It's definately worth a try....read it for youself! Its great~*"
2,Truely for the novice,"I received this yesterday and returned it today... It is a high level view of how to set the scene, communicate, touch and center yourself (and your mate). If you are new to sex this will be a good basic primer, if you're looking for more don't bother."
1,Bad fake!,"I haven't heard a lot of albums that were this kitschy, campy and fake as this one. With electric piano's, synths and other electronic stuff. Ev'ry Celt musician with a little bit of love for genuine Celtic music will laugh (or cry) when hearing this. And it will not be because of joy, take my word for it. Don't buy this!!! Search for ""Lyra"". That's really good."
5,A great paper trimmer,At the scrapbook store where I work this is the favorite paper trimmer among the staff. It holds your paper securely while you trim and the fold out arm makes it easy to measure larger pieces of paper.
2,Lefties beware,"This seems to be a quality cutter. It was highly recommended to me by friends and others. It cuts well. I like that it is a bit larger than other cutters; this is good for cutting 12x12 paper so you don't feel cramped. My issue is that it is very awkward. I believe a lot of this is due to being a lefty. The extension bar for measuring is not in a place that works well for me. This would be okay if I could flip the cutter around, but because the bar that holds the paper in place only raises on one end, it makes it awkward no matter how I turn it.So, righties, this one is a good one for you. And lefties... I guess if you are highly coordinated... :) otherwise, lefties beware."
1,Flimsy,"Judging by the other reviews, I must have been just unlucky but my ruler broke off after only two uses."
2,Does not cut well,I got this cause it was one of the cheaper paper cutter and smaller but I would not recommend this because mainly the slider is VERY STIFF. It's like arm work out! Also the paper really doesnt stay still unless you hold on to the paper by the cutter. The ruler that extends out is very stiff to put in and out of the cutter. I've tried cutting different types of paper but it only cuts the thin papers well and once you get into the thicker scrapbooking papers it wont cut well. And I dont really like how you have to hold down the blade. I am going to switch to the one where you dont have to. I would recommend spend a bit more and get a better one.
3,Wish for pictures,"The recipes seems yummy but this book contains no pictures at all.When i buy a cookbook, i like to see the results so i know i made it right.Disappointed that there was no pictures. Decided to return the book."
5,Dos Almas De Espana,If you like Spanish style classical guitar you will love this one. Fantastic. All 12 Tracks. You don't have to delete anything.
2,As is - these are not very good. But with some modification - perfect.,We bought several of these for our different store locations. First issue is that they are not quite wide enough to use in a half wine barrel. not sure if a whiskey barrel is an inch more narrow - but it isn't quite snug enough with the half wine barrel. Second issue is that the water has no where to go - so unless you drill some holes in the bottom of these they will get too heavy and fall through into the barrel. Our solution was to get a block from home depot - like the ones used for block walls. Put it under the liner to hold it up. Then drilled a few holes in the liner so they could drain. Now they work perfect.
3,Could have been much better,"I unfortunately have to temper the enthousiasm from the previous reviewers a little. Sure, the CD collects some cool remixes, but leaves many out too. Where is ""Eyes of Truth"" (Gotterdammerung Mix)? ""Eyes of Truth"" (from ""The Matrix"") was also notably absent from the regular Greatest Hits even though it was a single. And this release also did not make available the out-of-print omen mix of ""Principles of Lust"" or any of the remixes of ""Rivers of Belief"" or the unreleased ATB mix from ""Silence Must Be Heard"".Bottom line is, with the CD running only 60-something minutes, this could have been done much better. They could have at least put the excellent ""Eyes of Truth"" and ""Rivers of Belief"" remixes on the CD. It doesn't make sense to not fill up the 78 minute capacity, when high quality and appropriate material is available, especially when everybody is already downloading mp3's all over the place. Make your CD at least a complete document, so that people will buy it !"
2,Enigma disappoints with its selection of remixes,"I am a HUGE Enigma fan. Thus, I have all their singles and all the remixes. This CD, with the exception of ""Turn Around"", ""Push The Limits"" and ""Sadeness"" has picked the lesser of the songs' remixes. It's a shame because Enigma has very good remixes. The awful remix of ""Gravity of Love"" should've been replaced with the sweet, jazzy remix on the ""Turn Around"" single. ""Mea Culpa""'s remix should've been the Orthodox Version that is on the song's video (no one can get this mix otherwise!). And the Midnight Man Mix of ""TNT For The Brain"" is on the LSD album already! Why did Cretu choose to redundantly put it on the remix album? Very disappointing."
4,"Cute sized sketchbook, great for markers and charcoal.","I usually work with bigger sketch books, but I find I enjoy this one for quick sketches and when I'm really on the go. Canson is my favorite company to buy sketch books from as I enjoy the thickness of the paper and how well it take traditional media. These are a bit more lighter then the Mix Media sketchbooks, but can still take markers and other heavy mediums well."
5,Absolutely love it!,"This pad may be small, but I absolutely love it. My Copic pens don't bleed through, and I love how you can put it in your bag or such and take it anywhere."
3,Not Great!,"I bought and used this sketch book for sketching with ink (fountain pen and india inks). I didn't use it for pencil or charcoal sketching, so I cannot comment on that.I found that the paper shows some bleeding, and the nibs (of my fountain pens) often get clogged due to the fibers from the paper. I would not be buying this brand again."
3,O.K,"It's too bad I didn't read carefully enough to find out that this book is smaller than what I'd expected! Also, the 'peeling adhesive' bit on the front of the sketchbook would suggest that the actual sketchbook cover is pure black, and that a giant sticker is covering it. Nope; that's the cover! It's made out of lightweight cardboard, so I guess I can paint over it to fix that problem. =) Unfortunately, the pages are a little too thin to my liking.I still think it's a pretty good deal for the price (I got mine for around 5 dollars). It'll have to do for now."
2,Like any other sketchbook.,"I bought this for about 7 bucks with free shipping a week or so ago. Now it's cheaper but with shipping costs, it's even more expensive. I swear, the day I paid for this I went to walmart and found a similar one for 2 bucks. I bought it because why not? And when comparing them, they are virtually the same. This one has a thicker cover compared to regular ones, but that's not worth the money. This was over-priced and now it will cost you even more. Just go get one at Walmart, the paper is the same quality. I was going to return it but it was too much of a hassle."
3,Difficult to rate,"so to be clear i gave this product a three star review for mainly one reason. I ordered it on June 18th, and i received it yesterday July 20th. What the freak Amazon, that is awful. The sketchbook itself is quite nice and a good little size, but for it to take 33days to get here, thats awful. Maybe (i dont remember) i didn't order it with prime at the time, but either way it said sold by amazon llc. The item, good. the service, terrible."
5,Sweet,The Notebook in question is pretty sweet I can draw anywhere and it really helped me to further my artistic vision. I actually seem to have made my art look better and a lot more colorful which is what I needed. Plus I can take it anywhere obviously haha Good item :)
4,high quality item,The quality is excellent and will be a wonderful portfolio book.Paper is fine.Only exception is that the pages are not easily removed.
4,Good Quality,I love this book. It isn't big and awkward like some sketch books. Its good size and the paper is thick enough that nothing bleeds through ruining other pages. I will definitely buy again.
5,Vinx is ALWAYS worth it!,"This is just another set of stories set to music that touches your very core. Some what of this world, but sometimes hard to believe it all comes from him. If you can, buy and listen to this over and over again. You'll thank yourself."
5,Good work,"good show, good experience, everything as it should be and enjoyed the dvd. Not much else to say but Yay"
2,Not As Promised,The 2007 OnLine Research Guide was not included as promised. I wrote the seller regarding this and got no response.
2,I wasn't very impressed with this lotion. I ...,"I wasn't very impressed with this lotion. I don't think I'd choose to buy this in the future. The fragrance was much too strong for a lotion. It did a nice job of moisturizing my skin. It went on smoothly and wasn't greasy. But, I just didn't care for the scent at all."
3,I don't like the smell of patchouli but ...,"I don't like the smell of patchouli but figured in a lotion it would be pretty mild. My husband does like the smell so I thought he'd like it. I was wrong, the smell was very overwhelming. My husband even got tired of it and said it was a little too much. I'd recommend it to someone who loves the smell of patchouli. Other than that the lotion worked great and was very moisturizing."
1,"""PigPen's"" Favorite","Charlie Brown's buddy PigPen would love this moisturizer's scent because IT SMELLS LIKE DIRT! I love the patchouli bath/shower gel because it does have a nice smell-LIKE PATCHOULI! This stuff, however, has the added bonus of hemp seed oil which probably gives it that ashtray full of marijuana roaches aroma. Well, I'm stuck with it and will continue to use it until I've become (hopefully) de-sensitized to it. In future, I'll just use Cetaphyl unscented lotion or cream after the patchouli shower gel."
4,"I was very pleased with this product, as ...","I was very pleased with this product, as I have been with any Kiss My Face product. It's very soothing to dry skin and the scent is very calming and enjoyable, although it took a little getting used to. This isn't a thick lotion and a little goes a long way. I found it better to apply a little and go back again later and reapply. I'll definitely buy this product again."
3,Being a regular user of Kiss My Face ...,"Being a regular user of Kiss My Face Peaceful Patchouli Shower Gel, I was excited to try the lotion. The feel and texture of the lotion was nice, but I was disappointed in the scent. It doesn't have the clear patchouli scent found in the bath gel. Even being a fan I found the scent a bit hard to live with."
3,"Good content, poor filming","After taking a college class in Kundalini yoga, I was really excited to get a video that I could use on my own at home. The poses used are easy and the modeling is good. The sound on the tape is poor and makes it very difficult to use."
3,Okay doll...,Jade is my fav bratz doll and i dont like it when people says she looks ugly if they really think that they should keep it to them selves its for the best you know?..i really like my scene dolls they rock! and bratz dolls but i kinda like my scene better..but this doll is cool! but i think she should have had a cat not a dog...
4,Not mixing punk w/ [...],"I am not a big Bratz fan, but I do like this doll. This doll unlike the other Bratz in this collection, does not mix punk with slut. I actually like her outfit, its something I would definatley wear! I really like the whole British theme, since the punk sub-culture originated in the United Kingdom! I do think they should have added things like maybe a The Clash T-Shirt or maybe The Ramones, that would be cool! But being a doll collector since I was a little girl, I have seen some good and bad things, this is good! Punk is not a bad thing and this doll helps show its not! I reccomend it. The other dolls in the series, I do not, well at least the girls. They look like their trying too hard. I haven't seen the boys up close yet, so I can't say anything about them!"
2,YET ANOTHER SNOOTY PRETTY IN PUNK BRATZ!!!!,"Jade has ugly make-up and a face like a snooto!!! SHE also looks like she came out of the my scene closet!!!!!! Cloe and Yasmin are the best ones, though Meygan and Jade are ugly, snooty, snobby, and VERY stuck up!!!!"
1,YUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This do is realy ugly and scary.Her make-up is not great.What slutty clothes.Don`t buy this doll.BRATZ DOLLS SUCK.P.S.I DON`T CARE IF SOMEONE WILL BEAT MY REVIEW.
2,She looks goth.,She really does... Her shirt doesn't show off her stomach though... I do like goth dolls but I hate bratz...
1,BACK AT YA,all u bratz fans cum n say trash abt the myscene dolls so im gnna do wat u do to us ... FIRSTLY WHO WANTS A DOLL HU LOOKS LIKE SHE LIVES IN THE DRAIN!???! iv e been to london and the ppl there r not as ugly as this this is a disgrace to the british u can find better dolls in the dumpster than this.... u duys trash my scene but luk at this rubbish doll and just take a spoonful of ya own medicine... leave the my scene doll alone and go and play with ur trash dollsbratz- the wannabe girls hu havee passion fur trashin'1!! seriosly she luks like a wierdo wannabe ~WW~!!!!
1,Why go for Bratz?,"Bratz are not good. Here are the reasons that justify my opinion:1. Bratz dolls don't smile.2. Bratz dolls have big lips.3. Bratz dolls have no feet.4. Bratz dolls dress unappropriatly.5. All Bratz stuff is spelt wrong.6. Everyone knows that when you say ""Stop being a brat"" you mean idiot7. Bratz are English but have slanty eyes.8. Bratz are too skinny.9. Bratz stuff breaks.10. Bratz stuff are all to expensive.11. Bratz heads are too big.12. Bratz have no proper history.12. Bratz are too big.So, Bratz stink! Move out Bratz, Barbie's coming through!!!"
5,one of the best in gnosticism,"As a Gnostic, it was a delight to read this book. Everything I knew and did not know, I found in detail in this book by Jonas.You will find the background on the history of Gnosticism in Alexandria; history on its development; the various contributors (e.g. Babylon, Syria, Greek), the various ""systems of thought"" (eg Valentinian) and their proponents; and a bit of philosophy on Metaphysics.The excerpts and quotations from ancient Gnostic sources like the Mandaeans tracts and Manichaean books are very helpful and exciting. It is well structured and very easy to follow!A disadvantage is that it tends to overlook the influence of ancient Egyptian mythology of the after-death (regarding the journey of the soul after death), which influeced Gnosticism profoundly! Also it does not mention the Cathars and Catharism. But this should detract nothing from the book, it is a classic and a masterpiece on Gnosticism!"
2,not so good,"Verbose, convoluted, difficult to follow. If you want to learn about the Gnostic Religion go to a more recent account. There are many out there. I picked the wrong one here."
4,A thrill ride...,"I don't understand why some people seem to enjoy trashing a book. ""Thrill"" isn't the finest horror novel ever written, but it's a lot of a fun and a thrill ride. The author seems to have worked hard to streamline the action and keep the reader hooked. I can only surmise that the dude who trashed ""Thrill"" has a pretty poor attention span. It's good stuff."
1,Awful!,This is so horribly designed it didn't work as a bottle opener at all. I found a replacement and this one went right in the trash.
1,you gets what you pays for,"Yes. they were cheap to buy and cheap in quality, We bought 2 and one would not, could not open a can at allno recommending this product"
1,Not as promised,"There is no magnet. At all. Not at all. I ordered this because, strangely, it has become difficult (OK, impossible) to find a punch-type can opener in all my central OH stores. Plus, instead of drinking coffee, I'm trying to develop a taste for drinking hot chicken broth, hence my desire for a punch-type can opener.I won't bother trying to return this (it suits my needs) but FYI.Geez, no magnet. And a lot of non-recyclable packaging.RJD"
4,"Could improve it with a stronger magnet, but glad they still make these magnetic ones","I call this my ""tooth"" and use this all the time, but rarely for what it was designed to do. It is easy to find (just keep it on the fridge above a plaque, which keeps it from sliding down due to the weak magnet). My hands are weak, so I often grab this for various functions such as ripping through plastic wrap, loosening a lid by letting air enter, using it as a miniature pry bar, etc. Thank goodness there is no ""decorative plastic"" attached to it to get in the way. It is simply a metal church key with a magnet on the back."
4,Good stuff so far,At first I thought this conditner was a little thin but after putting on 2 coats it really bought back the luster to my cover.We also got alot of rain after I protected it and the condioner held up very well.A pint looks like it will be enough for quite a few times and time will time if the sunlight does less damage to my cover.Still this is a must for any outdoor spa that is in the elements.
5,Perfect for Frequent Travelers,"I bought these specifically because I travel alot and it grosses me out to remove my shoes and walk on airport floors. I slip these on and have never once been challenged by TSA. In fact, one of the screeners complimented me on my ""nice shoes""! I'm a little extreme when it comes to cleanliness so some people may not see the value in using this item for traveling, but if the thought of picking up airport gremlins on your bare feet or socks gives you pause, this may work for you."
3,They work for what I needed them for-a little small,"I keep these in the front closet for people that need to come in and don't want or can't take off their shoes. Helps keep the carpet clean. I have had some issues getting them on my shoes, I wear a 12 and they are a little small for bulky boots and running shoes."
1,Too slippery,I ordered these as I was getting new carpet and wanted to keep it clean. These covers are very flimsy and very slick. You would not be able to walk on the carpet or flooring with these on and not slip. Would not recommend.
1,Breaks easily,These shoe covers are not worth getting. They are of very poor quality and some even come pre-broken. They rip when you put them on and can not be relied on to stay on your feet.
3,Shoe covers,Covers come packed in convenient bundles. They are smaller than I had expected. It may be difficult to pull them over large shoes.PE Disposable Plastic Shoe Covers BLUE 100 Ct. BSC3501B-100
5,PE Disposable Plastic Shoe Covers,These are great. We live in the country and never know who has what on the bottom of their shoe. Our house was for sale and whenever people came to view they needed to put on a pair of these disposable shoe covers. Kept things nice and tidy.
4,Served the purpose,I left these by the door when I had my condo up for sale so that people coming in to see the place wouldn't track dirt/mud all over my light beige carpeting. They worked well and served the purpose. I had a lot left over and have been holding onto them since they'll come in handy during other home improvement projects.
5,Shoe protectors,"I have darko feet with open sore that leaks thru the bandages sometimes, so I woulsd wear shoe protectors over my socks to protect our rugs, the truly plastic shoe protectors would rip, these are stronger than the regular shoe protectors, and they don't wear out as fast. This item will keep my rugs clean untill I get surgrey to correct my problem, then I can use them out side in the garden.Great item for both stocking feet and shoes"
5,Blue plastic shoe covers,came in very handy during a snowy and icy weekend to protect carpet where there are little ones crawling about
5,Excellent service,"Don't have to remove our shoes after coming in from our garden. Just slip these on our boots and ""voila"" no tracking of dirt into our home. Great service from this company. Fast delivery!! We highly recommend this company and their product. Oh, and I don't have to throw these covers away, just rinse them off and dry it, good to go another round!"
3,Photo is misleading,The photo used to display this product is misleading. t makes the shoe covers appears to be a thicker plastic than they are.
5,Waterproof and economical,I've been purchasing these for almost 2 years now as use as a barrier between environment and my shoes to minimize bio-contamination between farms. The plastic is pretty thick so doesn't tear easily. I can usually walk 3 miles before wearing a hole through them. Just don't scuff your feet.
4,Great AFI Record,"I have to admit, i only jumped on the AFI bandwagon when i saw ""Sing the Sorrow"" on sale for $9.99. I picked it up, and it took some getting used to, but i really loved Davey's lyrics and the music was incredible. So after i had enjoyed that record a while, i heard that the album ""The Art of Drowning"" was their best to date. I wondered how it could top Sing the Sorrow so i picked it up. To my surprise, the sound was almost totally different. It was ALOT more punk and hardcore and less intricate and melodic. Thankfully, i like both styles, so this suited me well. Anyways about a week or 2 ago, i picked up this record. Its amazing. I think it tops The Art of Drowning because it has such a unique and interesting sound. Some of it melodic, some of it brooding, some tear-your-head off hardcore and...you get the picture. This is a work of art and it should be seen as such. If you are into any of the genres i have just listed, or just appreciate great rock music, pick this up."
5,AFI's Best Cd Ever,"BSTS is the best afi cd of all time it mixes a bit of new style , and all their old stuff. anyone who likes any type of rock, weather it be punk, metal, or whatever it os you will love this cd.and for all those people that new afi sucks, and they only like their old stuff, you are not true afo fans and you should stoop listening to them. Email me at DAvey5551@hotmail.com."
3,not what i was hoping for,"i bought this album after reading the ""rave"" reviews on here about it...what a let down. im still giving it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars even though i didnt think it deserved that, notice i said i, its only my opinion. the songs all sound alike. before i could leave the mall parking lot i looked down and my player said song 4. i was like what the heck? i just popped it in and i couldnt even tell when the last song had ended and the next one began."
4,They Sold Out Bigtime,"First of all, everyone who is saying listen to Clay, Clay is gay. Everyone being mentioned in the reviews are faggots. This is music, this is power, this is punk the way it is suppose to be and AFI will most likely never get their sound back. This is a great album and recommended for anyone who likes hardcore punk, however, the vocals can be annoying at times but it is still very good."
2,If you a like AFI don't buy this,"Clearly everone on this review is jumping on the punk rock bandwagon....this AFI worst album by FAR...buy the other 3, this one just plain sucks"
1,This is a bad excuse for punk rock,This CD is horrible and the vocalist is the most annoying singer ever. Do not waste your money on this cd.
1,"No talent, too angry, too fast","OK first of all this isn't singing its just a bunch of screaming and shouting. Second of all whats with all the pirate imagery on the cover? Is this suppose dto make this ""band"" (and I use the term loosely) look evil or dangerous? Ooooh... spooky! NOT! I agree with the reviewer below, if you want REAL music from AUTHENTIC artists with INTERGRITY take a pass on this ""offering"" and check out Clay Aiken instead."
1,AFI IS EVIL AND SATAN,What happened to the days of happy music like Brittany Spears and Backstreet boys. I bought this album because i liked the song girls not grey and i bought this filthy garbage of santanism. This album is evil and I do not think it should be allowed. AFI SUCKS
5,Excellent Addition to Any Collection,"Black Sails is a good bet, especially if you get only one AFI album. BSitS holds up after many listenings. I guess its pretty obvious to say its a very solid album. It is an excellent addition to the collection. I can see this holding a spot in my case after my AFI obsession proper fades. Black Sails is representative of not only the band that created it, but also of the genre (sub-genre? sub-sub genre? whatever!) It adds the element that defines it to your collection quickly and succintly. While personally I prefer The Art of Drowning, it takes alot more to appreciate. If you are into AFI more than casually check out the rest of their catalog, all of which is great. But, if you are interested in purchasing one album that is a great example of all they are about and one that will be a favorite for longer than a spin or two, get Black Sails."
5,Genre defining album,"This masterpiece, easily AFI's best, marks their transition from average pop/punk band to one of the scene's best innovators. This album is superbly crafted dark gothic punk, unlike anything done before. While bands like the Misfits and the Cure had the look and are strong influences, AFI's sound differs substantially. Compared to normal punk, AFI are more poetic, emotive and musically superior. Jade Puget's guitar work is original and the drumming is excellent. Davey's vocals are less whiny than previous releases and the use of vocal harmonies really sets AFI apart from other bands. There are few bands around that can claim to play so hard and fast yet retain so much melody."
5,black sails in the sunset,"black sails is a great album,filled with a mix of hardcore punk and melodic riffs.AFI, i think, have trully defined themselves on the most personal level with this album. Davey Havok's lyrics are like poetry mixed with personal agony and will strike an interest with the personal side of you,the listener, while the rest of band sets a tone of emotional,aggressive,hardcore punk rock.If you don't listen to AFI, this album will make you become a fan.It is one of my personal favorites of all time."
3,good cd,GOOd cd. Best song on here is called God Called In Sick Today. most songs on here are good cd. I'f you like screaming music it's a good cd. But it's not really heavy metal. Overall it's a good cd.
4,AWESOME,This cd is mad different from their first two releases... But it misses alot. But I love AFI. This cd is pretty awesome ... Fast and loud. Beautiful lyrics... Art Of Drowning is their best work though
4,Great,"This is one of the most original cd's I've ever heard. The sound is hard to describe. It's dark punk/hardcore with an eighties singing sound. It's one of my favorite albums ever. It's an absolute must buy. The weaknesses of this cd are the lyrics are hard to understand. They definately have a dark thread that is in almost every song. Another thing is the songs sound similar. It's still great but there are times when I don't know what song I'm on. Yet, even though these might be letdowns, this is still a must have."
4,AFI- It kinda grows on you.,"When I first started listening to AFI, I found the vocals quite annoying, and the smashing of the insturments in an attempt to make music just monotonus. But after listening to ""A Single Second"" and ""Salt For Your Wounds,"" I began to enjoy in AFI what i had previously disliked. I began listening to them more, and got a hold of Black Sails on the Sunset. I found it interesting and exciting, but just slightly boring. It was a change from the punk rock i was used to (Blink 182, The Vandals, Guttermouth, ect.) but almost all the songs sound the exact same. Several Songs like ""Narritive of SOuls AGainst Souls"" and ""God Called in Sick Today"" rise above the noisy pattern. All in all, Black Sails... is a powerful and good album."
5,AFI is Godly,AFI's best cd yet. Every song on this cd is so electrifying and full of life i almost want to cry. They have really progressed as a band.
5,Through our bleeding we are one!,"This cd is awesome....I have listened to it so many times and still am not tired of it. Davey Havok has amazing vocals and writes great lyrics. If you've never heard anything from AFI, go download the song ""Totalimmortal"" It shows of the whole bands talents to the full extent. My favorites on this cd are Malleus Maleficarum and God Called In Sick Today. I would reccommend this cd. It's 15 bucks well spent!"
5,The Definitive Punk Album Of All Time...,"Amazing piece of art. ""God Called In Sick Today"" = quite possibly one of the best songs I've ever heard. A classic."
4,"Ahoy, matey!","Although I'm a relatively new AFI fan, I gotta say that this is one of their best releases. Musically and lyrically, it's top-notch. Definitely one of the better CDs to start off with."
4,OK CD,"For some reason I am disapointed in this CD. For all of the other reviews I have read for it say that it is the best AFI album. I just feel some way that the songs are dull for some reason. But I do like some of the songs like ""God Called In Sick Today"" and a few others. I gave this CD 4 stars because it is good but not great. But remember reviews are other peoples opinions. So read other reviews and preview the tracks, for I do not know if this is a must for an AFI fan.Cheack out my other reviews for other AFI albums. Thanks!"
5,Something else,"Sorcerer has been given short shrift in Ian Carr's otherwise excellent Miles biography. Others have typecast this recording as being self indulgent abstraction, insular chamber music that is not 'down with the people'. I don't buy any of that.This is the sound of musicians listening to each other, enlivening and feeding each other, imbued with a seventh sense. ""Masqualero"" is a particular fave, but any of the others track could be. Don't believe the cold reviews, on ""Sorcerer"" these lads create a magical world of their own, they play as a band of equals .. it is a true 'group recording' where Miles is a member .. not particularly leading anything. It's all very transporting, engaging, satisfying .. I can't believe that I refrained from getting this for years .. but am making up for it now, set disc to multiple repeat."
5,Excellent heavy-duty skillet,"I bought this pan about a month ago.Cons: It's a little smaller than my previous 10-inch skillet, because it angles in toward the base. The surface isn't completely flat; there is an odd shallow bump that makes it look like a second but doesn't interfere with the pan's use at all.Pros: It fits my existing 10-inch lids just fine, no need to buy a special lid. Excellent heat distribution -- amazing. The heavy bottom holds heat really well. Great pan."
4,Equus,This was a great book to read. It is a play book. It has mystery and thrill. I would say that this is not a children's book but more of a teen/ adult book.
4,A Shocking Play that Focuses on the Role of Religion and Myth in the Modern or post-Modern Era,The play covers the life of a troubled lad. His mother is a religious zealot and his father an ardent atheist. The young man tries to find meaning in a world of contradictions and void of spiritual value.This is a play that makes you think. A real masterpiece of theatre.
5,A Voice Infused with The Holy Spirit... **AMAZING**,"I cannot find the words to describe Mahalia Jackson's voice. Recently I discovered the power of gospel (being Episcopalian I never really am exposed to much besides contemporary, which I am not a huge fan of) and Ms. Jackson is at the top of my list. Never before have I heard a voice so deeply in love with and filled with praises for Our Lord.This CD needs more than a measely 5 stars. It reaches far beyond anything my heart has tuned into for a long time. Thanks be to God for Ms. Mahalia Jackson!"
1,selective and elitist,"What sounds like an intriguing book falls flat upon reading it. Halley's version of feminism is an elite and whitewashed feminism that has been under attack for 25 years. Her critique is nothing new. By positing her definition of feminism, Halley exposes her own ignorance, particularly of the central place women of color have in feminism. What's also frustrating is the complete lack of political efficacy in her argument. She completely avoids issues of reproductive rights, which are central to feminism. She attacks feminism on the ivory tower theory level (which just so happened to have helped get her, and other female professors, her job) but completely ignores the other side of feminism: activism. Halley's book was dated when it was published and does more harm than good. To critique feminism, she needs to use a fuller, more accurate, and contemporary definition."
4,From Past to Present,"When Karissa and Asheris Asher's daughter Julia is kidnapped by the evil priestesses of Sekhmet, the problem-stricken couple must retrieve her before she is sarificed to the Lion Goddess of Ancient Egypt. Through crystals and a magical box that Karissa finds in her father's posessions, she learns who her mother, the beautiful Tasharyana was, her story, and the key to fighting the priestesses who have her child. This well written and researched book offers both a modern mystery and action setting with Karissa and Asheris, and a romantic, yet sad, background with the ill-fated Tasharyana, and her lover Julian."
4,perfect if you do not need to read & write Arabic,"This Dictionary is very suitable for people who only learn how to understand and speak Colloquial Arabic. In my teaching I use romanized Arabic texts. For students mastering the basics, this Dictionary is very suitable."
4,Design of Experiments,The book provides a very good introduction on the use of factorial analyses to support design of experiments.Most of the text is easy to follow. The chapter on fractional factorial design is a little difficult to follow and requires reading multiple times to gain an adequate understanding. Other chapters are clear and easy to understand.
5,my absolute favorite movie!,"If your a big fan of animal planet's crocodile hunter tv show, then you will love this movie! Plenty of action, awsome stunts! I recomend as good family entertainment fun. The only dissapiontment that I got out of it was the fact that it was recorded as widescreen format. If you haven't seen this DVD go out and get it! Its worth the money."
3,"Not bad, but not great","If you like the show, you'll probably like this movie. It's basically a sow with a goofy plot about a spy satillite tacked on to fill up time. The bad point of this movie is that the animal encounters seem to be staged, so it loses some of the excitement and energy present in the show. If you're not a fan of Steve's, you sould give this a pass. If you ARE a fan, well you already have it, don't you?"
1,This was a croc,I gave the movie one star only because I like steve. Honestly I thought the movie was horrible. I love the series on animal planet so I decided to take my girlfriend to see the movie. After an hour into the movie we left. There was no funny parts that I can recall. I was absolutly amazed by the lack of truley humorous parts in the movie. The only way anyone would enjoy this movie was if they got drugged up before they watched it. Then I still don't know if they would like it. I was very dissapointed but they can't all be good.
4,Collision Course,"A must for Steve Irwin fans. He was truly genuine and unique, and he will be missed for many years to come."
1,don't see this,"wow, what can I say about this movie. I was forced to see this movie by my little brother, and all I can say is that this movie was terrible! I felt like I was locked in a prison and being tortured! This movie should of gone straight to video. The entire movie's plot had nothing to do with Steve Erwin, other than the fact that he happens to stumble along the satelite info. near the end of the movie. The rest of the movie, it just shows Steve and Terri finding animals, and some CIA agent looking for the satellite. It was more like the t.v. show than anything else. If you have younger kids that watch the show, than you should get this for them. But if you don't, than this is not the movie for you."
2,two movies in one...,"this is a farce of a movie. i think what they did is took a badcia/espionage movie that was going nowhere and combined it with steve irwin's astoundingly irritating discovery channel show. you'll feel like someone's channel surfing while watching this89-minute (could have been 14-minute) mess. there is NO connection whatsoever to the two stories. i'm giving it two stars onlybecause of it's originality. i've never seen a film quite like it, and hopefully never will again...- McCarty"
4,A good kid's movie,"My two are 4 and 7, they loved seeing the movie and they've asked for the DVD for Christmas. Croikey...dad's gotta pay twoice.The CIA stuff is light and only there to justify a movie length Crocodile Hunter episode. Some funny scenes when the CIA go over TV episodes of CH and come to the conclusion Steve is an undercover spy.The are a couple of ""wankers"" and a flatulence joke. The latter being highly amusing to kids and parents alike. All in all a fun hour and a half."
2,A movie without a Plot,"For a Discovery Channel 1/2 hour special this movie filled the bill, but for entertainment this selection missed the target. It was tough to decifer who the good guys were from the bad guys. Was the plot conservation of animals or some weak story line about U. S. government security. My suggestion is to wait until this comes to video and rent it... Spend your money more wisely like on popcorn."
4,A wonderful way to remember the legendary Steve Irwin,"If you were a fan of the late, great Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin, then Collision Course is a must-have for your collection. The movie isn't bad...not the best movie ever, but it's certainly entertaining enough, and if you enjoyed watching Irwin's shows, you'll have fun with this movie. Perhaps the best part is all the special features on the disc. There are several documentaries and deleted scenes that are just terrific and yet another way to immortalize Steve Irwin forever. Kids will no doubt appreciate this film too, and I don't think a single profanity is ever uttered in it. The price Amazon lists it for is decent, but I found mine shockingly enough right after Steve Irwin died in the $5.50 bin at Wal-Mart. Definitely a steal at that price! With Collision Course, you have a wonderful memento of the Steve Irwin we all loved so much. Enjoy!"
5,Crikey Review,"Being a big fan of the Crocodile Hunter, I loved this movie!!One of the great things of this movie is that it's great for allages. Like the Crocodile Hunter would say is that the beauty of the film is that everything is real and is right up with you. I was ethusiastic about all parts of the movie but one of my most favorite parts was when Steve Irwin got on the car and started to fight the CIA agent!! LOL!!! Those funny times!! Then there was also the part when he calmed down the biggest snake in Austrailia!! WOO!! It was amazing!!!!! I th ink the biggest reason that this movie is great was because of Steve Irwin himself!! Well I hope I convinced you into buying this great film!!"
3,CROCK CRIKEY,"Having become an international celebrity with his Discovery Channel series, it was inevitable that Steve Irwin and his wife, Terri, would make it on to the big screen. This they do in THE CROCODILE HUNTER: COLLISION COURSE. It's mainly an extension of his show with Steve spouting forth with indefatigable gusto all about the many critters found in Australia: crocodiles, spiders, snakes, kangaroos, etc. They've surrounded his improvisational dialogue with a lame story about a missing satellite black box, with intrigue and buffoonish CIA agents battling for the prize. Irwin and wife are oblivious to the fact that this particular prize was swallowed by the crocodile they are trying to relocate to a safer area...before a crazed ranchwoman (Magda Szubinski from BABE) kills it for killing her cows.It's all pretty lame but one can't help but get infected with the charismatic Irwin and his obvious enthusiasm for his work."
5,The Crocodile Hunter-Collision Course,"Wild and wacky and up close with the Crocodile Hunter's greatest moments, this DVD reminds us why we love Steve Irwin! Great adventure! Great info!"
4,Good old fashion fun.,"As another reviewer stated, it has no special effects (other than a few fake animal closeups, and editing magic). Made the way movies used to be. The plot is unplausible and lame, the acting could be better. A movie of Irwin and his wife carelessly playing with dangerous animals. I gave it 4 stars because my wife and others liked it. I thought it was amusing and held my attention at best. As an animal advocate Irwin should realize it's a bad idea to leave a rope tied around a croc's mouth mouth with a good possiblity that it will escape and die. I am bad at over-analizing movies. Kids should enjoy it."
5,"Love, intrigue and weighty questions","Beautifully written and a page turner, Nora Gallagher's first novel is something to shout about. A love story that raises our awareness of the period when the bomb was developed at Los Alamos, it also raises important moral questions without being heavy handed. You will be immersed in the story, the love, the intrigue and the locale before you realize you are also pondering weighty moral and political questions that have resonance for all of us in today's world."
5,praise for Changing Light,"About page 40 something into the book I had fallen over that beloved cliff in novel reading where you pass the point of no return...when work gets abandoned, dishes pile in the sink, and at 3am when you're aren't really sleeping anyway, you might as well read for awhile...Thant's the time I reread the beginning, just to be sure I'd absorbed the background. Changing light is a sensitive and insightful story about love, scince, an artist and and the making of the atomic bomb set in Los Alamos at the end of WW2."
2,Needs work,This book was a selection for our monthly book club. I found it almost painful to read. Very poor character development. Story line was adequate but not captured as well as it could have been.
5,"Wow, Nora...","Wow ..... what a story, Nora. I just loved it. (but why couldn't they stay together?? :-/ )Your descriptions of landscape I know slightly ... well, as you say, it's all in the details, and you really nail them.The priest, oh gosh, and did she forgive him?I loved all the characters, the unfolding of what was going on below the surface ...I hope you sell a million copies."
2,Meh...,"I was unimpressed with the novel as a whole. There is some interesting information on the A-bomb development and history but the characters are rather bland. We never really understand the fascination the husband, priest and Kavan all have with Eleanor b/c the description of her is so weak. She is just a generic heroine/female protagonist that we are supposed to care about b/c she paints presumably yet the paintings themselves, as another reviewer writes, are never adequately described for the reader to appreciate or understand. The characterization of Kavan is better but having all these famous incidental people in the background of the story, doing nothing, kind of reminds me of pointless cameos in movies."
5,Blues perfection from one of the forms greatest artists.,"Johnny Winter is without doubt the finest white bluesman ever to pick up a guitar. ""Be Careful With a Fool"" features some of the fastest electric licks in this or any other universe, with no compromise in taste and style. At the other end of the spectrum, ""Dallas"" showcases Johnnys deft acoustic bottleneck playing, plus an edgy attitude. Be careful when and where you play this CD; somebody might get hurt!"
3,A happy ending is always great but......,"What is it with these ""affairs or indecent proposals""? it takes away from the authenticity of the love in the story."
5,Another good one.,"I enjoyed reading this book. At first I said to myself, ""I hate this guy"", it's like how heartless can you be. They had Sterling almost hate-able. But of course the author pulls you in and softens up the so called bad guy and you end up falling in love with them. Hard hearts, strong will, hope, determination and love fill the pages of this book. It's definitely an enjoyable read. Madaris seris got me again."
4,"""Special Moments""","I really enjoyed reading this novel but Ms. Jackson, that same storyline about him/her looking for someone strictly to conceive a child and then eventually falling in love is getting repetitious."
2,NOT BELIEVABLE,"I was really disappointed in this book. I have read all of Brenda Jackson's books, I love the Madaris family stories. This story made Colby look like a weak female that knew right from wrong but she was willing to sacrafice that for the love of a man, not so much to save her brother's company. How could she agree to act as a vessel to carry this baby she contracted to give up in a year. She is suppose to be an advocate for children, but she was willing to birth a child for this selfish man just because he wanted an heir, what about the well being of the child. You don't sacrafice a baby to save a company, YOU FIND ANOTHER WAY TO SAVE A COMPANY. We as women should not be in awe of any man that we will do anything to be with him. NOT A GOOD MESSAGE"
4,Pulled me in from the first page!!,"When I read the summary for this book, I thought -- what kind of weak woman would ever agree to give up her baby like that?! I don't care how fine and rich the brother is! However, Colby is not weak at all. Even though she signed the contract, she had every intention of remaining a permanent part of her baby's life (she just didn't tell Sterling). To me, that redeemed her character. Sterling was hurt deeply as a child and he thought the best way to not be hurt again was to not get emotionally involved with any woman. I loved the way Colby didn't back down from his snippy remarks and commands. She held her own and he couldn't help but fall in love.All in all this is a great read. It only took me about a day and a half to finish. So far, I still like Eternally Yours and Fire and Desire the best, but this one is definately up there too!"
5,He made an offer she couldn't refuse!,"I really enjoyed this story. I was funny to me. Sterling really had a lot of nerves, but Colby got is number alright! It was a very romantic story in that two people tried their best to make the most of a very uncomfortable situation ( well maybe just in Colby's opinion). But like they say ""Love Conquers All."" You go Mrs. Jackson! Much Love to you."
5,Excelente!,For those of us interested in the practrical side of astrology this book is a must! It is a how-to guide you to dealing smartly with people...that is why the title is so appropiate!
5,Facilmente el mejor,"Este libro es facilmente el mejor libro de astrologia que he leido en los ultimos anos. Me gusto mucho la manera en que organizaron el material y lo facil que es de usar. Uno solo tiene que buscar su signo y hacer ""su pregunta"". Las ""respuestas"" son claras y al grano. Este libro se ha convertido en mi pequeno asesor astral portatil."
3,That Raimi Magic!,"As a big fan of Sam Raimi, I have to say I do like this movie. Crimewave is not as wonderful as Evil Dead 2 by any means, but it is pure entertainment, Raimi-style. Bruce Campbell even appears as womanizing bar scum. This movie doesn't deal with the supernatural, just a couple of extremely unattractive guys wandering around the city causing problems. It is sort of like Sam Raimi meets John Waters. While it is my least favorite of all Raimi's films, I still gotta have it."
2,Not so great,"After a long time trying to find the lost Sam Raimi/ Coen Brothers movie to rent I gave up and just bought the Region 2 DVD (cheao) from amazon.co.uk.This is the film Sam Raimi did after Evil Dead 2 that he wrote with the Coen Brothers. The film was beautifully shot with some real great camera work but quite simply does not work at all. The tone is all wrong for the script or the script is all wrong for the tone. Its like Airplane meets the 3 stooges meets I dunno what? The major plus is that Bruce Campbell has a supporting role as the sleazy ""Renaldo"" and is AMAZING. But this films score, acting, dialogue and sound effects are just horrible. Glad I saw it and glad I got it cheap. Anyone else seen this?"
4,Great fun,"This somewhat cartoonish comedy was written by the Coen brothers quite sometime ago. It's not refined and quite at the level of ""Raising Arizonia"" or""Blood Simple"", but for broadly played comedy it's hard to beat. This particular DVD is by way of China, but the copy is good and if you want you have the option of Chinese subtitles."
4,mascara,"I love this mascara! I have really sparse eyelashes, so this really makes them stand out. However, they look natural, which I wasn't expecting. There's no clumping whatsoever! I would recommend this macara to anyone. I did wish it came in brown-black though, as it only comes in black."
3,No Miracle!,It wasn't that much different than the Arbonne Lash Colour that I normally use. I wouldn't pay the difference.
2,fiber wig,"this product didn't deliver how i hoped. i use it in combination with dior show and it didn't make much of a difference if i just used the dior show on it's own. in addition, it's very difficult to take off with eye make up remover. i'll use the rest of the product, but i won't purchase it again."
1,Review of Fiberwig,This product did nothing - very disappointing - expensive and certainly not worth it! I get as much out of Cover Girl great lash than I did with Fiberwig.
3,save your money,"save your money. this product really does not impress me. my lashes are not longer, thicker or more beautiful than when donned with a drug store brand."
1,THIS MASCARA SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!THE BARGAIN DRUG STORE BRANDS FOR $5 WORKS BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!IT IS NOT MASCARA. IT DIDN'T DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT AND I HOPE THAT SOME OTHER POOR HARD WORKING SINGLE MOTHER WHO DOESN'T MIND PAYING FOR A SO CALLED GOOD ITEM DON'T GET RIPPED OFF LIKE I DID!ABSOLUETLY DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Imju Mascara,The Imju Fiberwig Mascara has too many little specks and NOT for people wearing contact lenses.
3,less than expected,"i am somewhat disappointed with the mascara but, on the plus side, it doesn't smudge easily and doesn't seem to clump a lot. if i use another mascara on top of the Fiberwig, i get the look i want. also, if i don't use a second mascara, little bits of the fibers tend to fall off. my husband, who is pretty oblivious to most things, noticed the difference in the appearance of my lashes and thought they looked nice."
5,Great gift!,I received this as a gift for my son when he was born and have since purchased A Block to Grow On several times as baby gifts or shower gifts. It is a lovely way to remember important dates as well as those milestones of the first year of life. It is one of my favorite gifts that my son received and I will continue to purchase this to share with other moms and their newborns!
4,Riveting,"Still Life with Husband is the story of Emily, a homely ""good girl"" who's used to her best friend getting all the attention. But when handsome David approaches her in a coffee shop, ignoring her best friend...she's gone. And she happens not to be wearing her wedding ring.The roller coaster of a plot kept me glued to the book and I finished it in a day. Despite the changes in the narrator's life, I felt the novelended positively, and there was a wry humor throughout that leavened the story's events."
2,Still Life with Husband,I did not like this book because I don't enjoy reading about a woman who is cheating on her husband. However I would be interested in reading this author's next book because I liked the way she writes - she keeps you interested.
3,entertaining but insubstantial,"This was a great airplane / airport read. ""Chick lit lite""Emily's husband doesn't listen to her about the future and wants them to follow his plan - baby & house in the 'burbs. Rather than face this difficult thing - turn up the volume - ""suburban house and baby, go ahead, have a good life"", she avoids fighting the hard fight and goes off and has an affair, telling herself every step of the way how bad the consequences will be. Unfortunately the author presents Emily over and over as a victim, when in fact her actions are the consequences of her own choices and actions, and at the end of the novel Emily is incredibly mean to her sister and family.Still, I found the novel very entertaining to read, and wonder how much of the exquisite detail came from the author's own life. I did feel that the author exaggerated the boorishness of Emily's husband a bit too much. FWIW my girlfriend was far more critical of Emily's behavior than I am."
2,not another modern love story,"It seems today most adult fiction, especially, chic fiction is basically the same storyline when it comes to love. Lots of self-absorption, a marriage that gets busted and well, there is no satisfaction of an ending. It would be nice to see some strength gained from the characters, but it seems to be the trend to let everything come undone and float on these days."
3,Good but not Great,"I loved some things about this book, such as Emily's relationship with her friend Meg, and her job at the Journal of Male Reproduction, where her boss is coincidentally named Dick. Other times the author was just too heavy handed. Emily's husband is not sympathetic at all, seeming like a controlling bore. Rather than understanding Emily's conflict, I felt like breaking off with him seemed the only sane option. The ending is also quite punishing of Emily in an unnecessarily over the top way. As readers (and humans) we know that affairs have negative consequences, but the level it is taken to here is almost comic."
3,Navel-gazing for the young and the restless,"""Still Life with Husband"" is a short tale of the self-absorbed navel-gazing that goes on when one decides to have an affair. Rather than being of any interest to anyone else (rather like sharing the dream you had last night - who cares?), this novel is yet another in the long line of the ""suburban angst"" genre that seems to be proliferating at the moment. Cautionary tale? Modern day Greek tragedy? Or nothing more than a treatise on self-justification in a society increasingly bent on not taking responsbility in the ""disposable marriage"" era. At only one point in this non-saga does the main character acknowledge that her choice was not needing to be made - it had been made some time ago at the altar. The author provides a lack of insight into the mindset of her husband, leaving a decidedly one-sided picture where the potential for a richer dynamic could have been instead. Not far-fetched, as one other reviewer has suggested, just banal."
3,"Women rule, men drool? Alls fair for me? Give my man a brain?","This book really hits the feelings and the thoughts on the head when you reach a crossroads in your life. This girl did the thing a lot of us do and destroyed her life instead of owning up to her real feeelings. She had an affair, and as I read her thoughts, mistakes, and impulses begging her no, I knew her and the story was true to me. Then along came the crap ending that tried to tie up disaster in and everyone went on with their life sort of way that made me want to puke blood. Please give her husband a pulse, give her lover some depth (after 6 weeks of passion, men don't say ""Oh crap I have morals""), and quit letting her friend be so perfect. Good till the last 50-75 pages. I want to kick Lauren Fox in the shins."
5,A very good read,I had thought this was going to be your typical Hallmark Hall of Shame melodrama. It wasn't.I thought the writing was excellent. The author successully mixed humor with the horrible. The story surprised me.I can't wait to read more from this author!
2,ebook,Disclaimer: I have not read this book yet... and I don't intend to. How could I trust anything the authors write about this subject when they have already clearly failed to 'manage digital continuity' by not making it available for Kindle!? I mean seriously-- no ebook version of 'Time and Bits: Managing Digital Continuity' ?
5,Silver Outhouse Earrings,"These are the cutest earrings, designed for those with a sense of humor. They are well made and let you express your wild side. They arrived in less than a week. I recommend these for anyone who needs a lift or a laugh."
5,Music made for Cathedrals,"Peter's melodies and lyrics are compelling, and his playing is crisp and precise (without being mechanical). Once you've heard this record, you'll realize he has been blessed with an irresistible voice and playing style that are truly unique. If you have a chance to see him play live, don't miss it. He and his music are even more powerful in person and will touch your heart."
4,NMR Jock,"Not a bad book for a freshman level text. Clear and easy to understand. The use of CGS units in somewhat annoying. This book will make a transition to a more advanced text like Jackson's ""Classical Electrodynamics"" more gentle."
4,Very good advanced introduction to E&M,"I used this textbook for my E&M class. For the most part, this book is very clear. The only drawback is that the last couple of chapters do not present E&M in materials very well. Also, make sure you are familiar with multivariable calculus (i.e. partial derivatives, gradients, multiple integrals, Stoke's theorem, etc.)"
2,The Opinion of a struggling Physics Major,"This is the Textbook used in Electricity and Magnetism at Hunter College of CUNY (at least for this semester) The book is a favorite with Physics instructors everywhere. As a Physics fanatic I can't help but reconigze the brilliant mind behind it. However, as many students that used this book, in my opinion it is better oriented for a professor than for a student. IT LACKS ANY SORT OF WORKED PROBLEMS. IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS EITHER, AND IN MY OPINION, THIS IS A VERY BIG PROBLEM. THERE IS NO STUDENT SOLUTIONS MANUAL AVAILABLE (AT LEAST I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY) Or, perhaps the Physics Majors at Berkeley are so bright that they don't really need to check any of it. Well, I am just a mortal who loves Physics, and like to learn it the right way (or at least what I think is the right way), by working hard and checking my results against those of the professionals."
5,Purcell is an amazing writer,"I am currently an undergraduate at the Case Institute of Technology, and for the last 20 years, our department has used Purcell's book for its Physics Honours II class and it is one of the BEST books available IF AND ONLY IF you have a good teacher who can derive some of the basics for you and aid you understanding some of the concepts."
1,At your own risk,"This whole MediaCenter serie still needs a lot of improvements. The computer is decently priced but the applications are not all integrated with the MS MediaCenter. The MC application is often buggy and often crashes. It also makes use of additional external apps very hard. The motherboard on mine was faulty and made the computer unable to reboot after 2 weeks. Even the front bezel was defective. I noticed that the same problem was noticeable on demos in stores. Also, don't expect external soundcard or video card to be compatible...i learned it the hard way with my creative card.To top all this, HP Support is mediocre at best. They ask you to ship them your computer and return it back to you a week later with no comments, no names of repair person, and even in my case missing parts that got stolen. You won't know what they tried to repair and just hope they didn't wipe your hard disk for no reason."
4,Good and Reliable,"I have had this Media PC for 4 years now and it has worked very well and it has just about everything you'll need or want. The only thing I did was upgrade the RAM. If you're going to edit video and pictures, it takes up a lot of space and memory, so if you don't like to wait while the PC catches up with you, then you will diffinetly want more RAM. Additionally, I purchased an external hard drive to store videos and pictures as 250 GB of space sounds like alot, once you get going with the video editing, you'll be greatly suprised how much space will be used up. Overall a great little PC HP! :)"
5,Required reading for all sales people in our company,"The classic. If your sale is the complex sale (multiple decision makers, large dollars, lenghty sales process), then this book is your sales bible. It is required reading for all sales professionals in our company. 'nuff said."
4,Review of Strategic Selling,"The main gripe I have with this book is that the authors are still selling it in the body of the book - well after I've already purchased it! I suppose it's to be expected, they are in sales after all...Even so, it is a good baseline method for anyone that is involved in selling where there is or will be a long term relationship to manage. It draws on principles from other fields such as change management - and while it isn't new to learn that you need to identify your influencers, and that you need to show them the ""win"" that they will achieve by backing you - it is it is good to be reminded of this and the other tenets that are laid out in this book.Overall, a good purchase"
4,Great Book... But Be Prepared,"This is a fantastic book and definitely warrants the praise thats been lavished upon it for the past 15-20 years. However, be forewarned, the book isn't an easy read. You should also be aware that, at 424-pages, it isn't a quick read either. However, if you're willing to put in the requisite time and effort, you will find one of the best books on ""complex"" sales ever written. I also highly recommend Bosworth's ""Solution Selling"" and Parinello's ""Selling to Vito."" Any and all of these three books are established classics. Overall grade: B+/A-"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Stephen E. Heiman and Diane Sanchez present a fully revised and updated version of a previously successful book Strategic Selling. They emphasize the need to know more than the basics of “tactical selling,” so you can make “Complex Sales,” which require the approval of two or more buyers. They provide a how-to blue print, drawing on material from their training program. The book shows step-by-step how to apply strategic selling to a current sales account. This excellent, well-organized, tightly written book includes examples and charts to guide the analysis process. We at ... recommend this book to sales managers and salespeople who are handling complex sales to corporations, governmental entities, or non-profit organizations."
3,"Great content, awful Kindle conversion","I'm 50% through this really helpful business book which I'm reading on my Kindle. But I seriously need to complain that whomever did the conversion to the Kindle version was super sloppy and unprofessional. There are typos all over the place, words are wrong because of the spelling, inappropriate punctuation comes up -- I just found a question mark in the middle of a word replacing an ""i"" in the word ""timidity""! And the graphics for the charts look like they were scanned in from a 10 year old copier with dirty glass. Seriously, they are just line graphs, how much time would it have taken to scan clean images for a business book?It's gotten to the point where it's distracting from the book content and I'm irritated to read it. For a company who's philosophy is based on giving their customers a Win/Result, this is a bad example. Read the hard copy instead."
2,Very basic,"Interesting preview, but far too basic, worth the time to listen to it but not worth paying any money for."
2,Fine data but oversold,The fist half of the book is just self promotion and little to no data. Overall I think the book could have been a pamphlet and communicated the data effectively.
5,A follow-on to the famed Strategic Selling book,This is the follow-on version to my all time favorite book on selling. It describes the complex sales process that many encounter when selling businesses to business products and services. This is an important read.
5,Strategic Selling energizes veteran or new sales people,"Strategic Selling was originally written about 20 years ago. This new edition adheres to the authors' axiom of changing to be successful in a competitive world. The techniques and processes of thinking strategically about a particular sales cycle will sharpen the focus of both veteran and novice sales teams or individual sales people. There is also a Miller-Heiman training course that is a great follow-up to reading this book. I have used this successfully with Kodak sales teams, as well as Value Added Resellers who wanted to strengthen their ability to manage complex solution sales. The concepts taught in this book are proven to enhance the ability to manage a sales funnel of prospects as well as large, complex sales."
5,People who follow the examples shown in this book will sell,"I have many years of industrial sales experience, and I started my own manufacturing business with venture capital financing (Big time selling). This book has the best approach to strategic selling that I have encountered. I read it to get recharged and check my practices. I recommend it to all new sales people."
5,Great B2B Book - It is one of the BEST,"This book is still one of the best. I recommend it to all the executives and companies I work with in turnarounding sales organizations and sales people who are struggling in the ""strategy"" of the deal.It is a GREAT framework for working a complex sale whether you are selling professional services, or a complex, large scale solution.It is not written and designed for anyone who is selling B2C or selling retail goods. There is no ""10 steps to closing the deal"" - it's about professional selling.Best of luck - JosephBMurphy.com"
2,HP Toner Cartridge C4194A (yellow),"I really cannot yet rate this product as I received it on 3/7/08 and my printer has not yet ""asked for a replacement of that particular cartridge"". The current yellow cartridge in my printer is only 40% used. Check back with me in about 2 months."
3,I wouldn't say that I have a real ...,"I wouldn't say that I have a real acne problem, just the occasional zits. This product did do a pretty good job of clearing up my complexion. However, every time I used it my face felt uncomfortably tight, and I was turned off by the medicinal smell. I don't know if I'd use it on a regular basis, more so probably for spot treatment."
4,I have used ZAPZYT face and body wash ...,I have used ZAPZYT face and body wash for almost a week now and am already seeing results. The only place I get breakouts is on the backs of my arms and this wash has almost made it all disappear. Nothing I've used in the past has been this effective. I would guess another week of use and it will all be gone. It also doesn't dry out my skin like a lot of products do. I love it and will be using it from now on. Where was this stuff when I was a teenager?
1,FRANKLIN TRANSLATOR,It didn't work when I got it. I changed the battery and it worked for a week and now it doesn't work again. Waste of money.
2,Super dud,"I was hoping to at least get some clear shots from this lens if I only used it in situations that allow lots of time and where the subject is not moving. Even under such ideal conditions, the lens does not allow clear usable shots. Even trying to touch them up in Photoshop CS does not help the clarity. You have to manually focus every shot and it takes many turns of the focus ring so it is very slow. The light it allows is very small and you have to take many many shot to calibrate under/over exposure. I thought it would help me get by until I could afford a good lens. It was a mistake. I shoudld have saved my money."
2,All that Glitters Isn't Gold,"The life of Consuelo Vanderbilt might have glittered but I truly believe her story would have been better told if she had used a ""ghost writer"". Events and people surrounding her life were fascinating but the monotone writing style made it difficult to maintain interest.Whether it was marriage, divorce, the Prince of Wales unexpectedly staying for the weekend........it all was the same monotone style.We never truly knew how she felt about anything..........."
1,slow read,"wasn't quite what I was expecting - after watching Downton Abbey, I was looking for a book like it - didn't happen"
2,Nothing shocking here,"This was a rather dull book. Consuelo does not provide any ""inside"" information. ""The American Heiress"" is a fictionalized version of this story and a more entertaining read. If you are looking for better info on the Vanderbilt family ""Fortunes Children"" is a very entertaining book."
3,Interesting but Difficult Read,"Most of the time I felt sorry for Consuelo, but I was glad that she salvaged the remaining years of her life. Born to privilege, a loveless marriage with royalty and so, so, so many rules ~ a poor little rich girl. Her memoirs are exceedingly detailed - I don't know how she remembered such minutiea - that's where I got a bit bored. But a different look into the gilded age."
5,Interesting with one's iPad,"It is written from her journal. I am almost 3/4 through the book and fascinating is an accurate word to describe it. Her information is grounded in history. I believe she must have been a person of substance. After her husband receives $4.3 million when married, restores his familial castle, and while she is still in her 20's and nearly deaf, he banishes her to an apartment in London. She does not whine, but looks at what she is able to do with what she has and that is to do so much good for women and their children in London. She was an amazing woman and I can't wait to finish the book, although, I will feel I am leaving a friend when I do."
4,A rare treasure,"The Glitter and the Gold is a rare look into the life of one of the most famous women in Victorian and Edwardian-era history. I can't say I enjoyed all of the chapters because the memoir covers Conseulo's entire life. I was more interested in her childhood through her marriage to the Duke of Marlborough.However, the book is one of the most accurate glimpses into exactly what life was like for the priveleged class 100 years ago. It's filled with stories from her childhood spent with the famous Alva Vanderbilt, the details of her engagement and spetacular wedding, and then her tragic marriage to one of England's most powerful noblemen. Then, she goes on to detail how she found true love and joy later in life, reconciling her past. The reader follows Consuelo through the marble halls of life, glimpsing wealth and privlege in America and Englad as few, if any, other books can equal."
2,glitter and gold does not shine,The Glittter and Gold was disappointing. The first hurdle to overcome was the typeface. It was awkward and difficult to read.The second problem was the writing itself. It was tedious and did not freely flow.I was interested in the topic but found the book ponderous.
2,Tedious,"Parts of this book are interesting, but most of it is not. CVB goes on and on about her charitable works, and people she knows and says nothing at all about some things I had hoped to read about. I know, for example, that she bought a Faberge jeweled egg while in Russia. She never mentions it in the book. She also rarely seems to draw any conclusions about the events which surrounded her."
4,I wanted more!!,"I was eagerly anticipating this book. It is an easy read, but it is definitely written in a very polite manner. I wanted more details on Consuelo's life, her marriage, her remarriage, her relationship with her mother, her husbands, and her sons. These topics were glossed over and I actually ended up ""Google-ing"" her to try and find out more about the important people in her life. Her mother, Alva Vanderbilt, was actually a very important person in the Women's Liberation movement of the early 1900's. Alva definitely was a ""character"" and it seems as if you either loved her or wanted to throw her off a bridge, but no one could remain unopinionated about her. I just wish this book, from Consuelo herself, went into more depth. I don't know if the day-and-age of 'tell alls' affects my review, but I definitely was left wanting more!"
2,A Teaser,"This would look amazing as a TV drama but makes tedious reading. Consuela is obviously hugely intelligent, well read and educated but really,if she could have created a world around herself, she would have been fulfilled. Some descriptions and observations are wonderful. Despite all the personages mentioned, she was the only one who really counted."
4,Lincoln the Indiana pioneer,"For many years this was the standard account of Lincoln's passage from childhood into teenage years and the verge of adulthood. Although the parts devoted to Lincoln may be superceded by a later treatment, Warren's volume contains many details of pioneer Indiana that aren't collected together elsewhere."
5,Impossible to put down!,"Samadhi's Circles in the Sand is a thought provoking read that I couldn't wait to finish. It is well written and the story flows from start to finish. This is not one woman's struggle; it is every woman's struggle for equality, self respect and self love. I recommend it to everybody.My only suggestion would be to include maps of the Middle East at the beginning to get a better understanding of Samadhi's travels.Way to go, Samadhi!"
5,Inspirational,"I have finished the book.... Oh my God! There is so much I want to say.Firstly that I'm so sorry for what you've been through-the agony of reading about your family.Secondly, and most important, how proud I am of you for many reasons-what you've turned your life experience into is an inspiration.Third, what a prolific and audience-capturing writer you are. My God, I really couldn't put your book down and everything except being a necessary mum went down the toilet so I could finish it.I felt all of the emotions that went with each chapter-and all of the peace from the rooftop of Tawam.You are such a talented writer. Honestly, I was spell bound and the manner in which you delivered your story is prolific. Look up that word and all that it means because it is you--and your talents.JS - Australia"
2,Horribly bad,I dont know what guttermouth were thinking with this album. And why on earth did they change drummers???This cd is very bad compared to Musical Monkey and i advise to stay clear.
5,we were innocents,Fantastic book.I passed this book to a friend and he loved it as much as i did.I would love talkimg to the author.
4,welcome change,"It's not so much that i don't like christmas music... it's just that you get beaten to death, from halloween 'til new years, by the same few tunes - year after year after year (ad infinitum). this is a much overdue addition to your holiday music options."
3,HOme for the Holidays,I bought this album on a whim. Just something a little different to add to my Christmas music collection. The music is very tracey (not house music) and you sometimes have to really listen to hear the traditional carol or Christmas song underneath...but it is an enjoyable listen. Was great at my Holiday party.
2,"Same Old, Same Old","If you own a disc or two of this type of music, you already own this one. Nothing different. You've already heard it. Skip this one and check out Merry Mixmas-Christmas Classics Remixed or Reindeer Room Vol.1 instead."
2,impractical,"Though this looked attractive, it is impractical because the sweater is not cut out in the belly area so that when your dog does his business, urine gets on the sweater."
2,Over sized,"this is a beautiful sweater but runs super large. Had to return it because of the size, waiting to hear about the return credit."
3,"He's not Peter, he's Ben Riley","Well, Amazon calls this ""Missile Launcher"" Spider-Man, but for all of you Toyfare readers out there, it's really just Web-Attack Spider-Man.I recently purchased this Spider-Man, because I thought it would be cool to have a Ben Riley spider-clone for my collection. Well, I must say that I was dissapointed with this action figure. For only being the seconde Ben Riley Spidey in exhistance, you think that Toy Biz would have put a little more effort into this toy. It's not even a new scuplt, he's all completely used parts from various Spider-Man classics action figure.If you are a Spider-Man fan, I think you may like to purchase this toy, however the real prize of this wave is the Carnage action figure, I nabbed him before Amazon ran out! I like him a lot!Maybe next time Toy Biz makes a Ben Riley, the will remember to at least sculpt the webbing on Spidey's body. Shame, Shame Toy Biz."
4,Master Storyteller,"Eisner's Contract With God looks at Jewish life revolving around one tenement in New York, from a Russian immigrant whose faith in God is shaken to summer shenanigans. The artwork is impeccable and Eisner's style appropriate to the gritty life in the tenements. Definitely not a ""kiddy book,"" is is nonethless a great example of graphic storytelling."
4,Start of a genre,"The ""first"" graphic novel, Will Eisner's A Contract With God is an unapologetic look at tenement living in NYC in the 30s. Taken from his own recollections from his childhood, Eisner creates 4 stories that combine to create a novel that is both unique in its vision as well as brutal in its honesty. Told as much in pictures as in words, Eisner used this book as a stepping stone to creating a body of work using the then blossoming, now growing medium of the graphic novel."
1,Classic does NOT translate well to Kindle,"Looked forward to reading this but the low-res scan of black and white cross-hatching heavy art works against it on Kindle. It's only just readable on the Kindle reader for PC and even worse on the actual Kindle 3 device.It's still a classic, but this digital format really fights it. Caveat emptor!"
4,A Good collection of get Crunk singles,There was two songs on this single the hit crunk singles Neva Eva wich even I will admit is hot and Headbussa wich is some wackness.No rapping really at all but these Lil Jon Proteges are good at yellin with some chorusis wich make every Lil Jon affiliated song work.check this song outNeva Eva-Lyrics 4/10 Production 8/10 Chorus 10/10 Overall 7.5/10Headbussa-Lyrics 6/10 Production 6/10 Chorus 8/10 Overall 6.5/10
1,Does not even qualify as music,"I did not even buy this CD single, but I've had the displeasure of coming across this video on MTV. I had thought MTV stood for ""Music Television,"" but I evidently had thought wrong. ""Neva Eva"" is by far the worst incarnation of ""music"" I've ever encountered in my life. The lyrics are generic, repetitive, and frankly sound as though they were written by someone mentally retarded. No wait, I take that back. Someone who is mentally retarded could write better music than this crap.Perhaps people just take a look and see that Lil' Jon is contributing, and therefore by some form of amazing grace the song will suddenly breathe life, but in this case, there is nothing inspiring about this song other than a sudden will for suicide. Someone put these guys out of their misery...""Neva Eva"" buy this CD."
2,hello sugar rush!,"the #2 ingredient is sugar...... i mean, ""organic evaporated cane juice."" basically like feeding your kid a donut for breakfast, IMO. way way way too sweet."
3,Texas Ranger Tales,"Mike Cox has written a fun, fact filled essay that is a quick and easy read. Each chapter is a separate story related to some past instance of Texas Ranger history. This book does not contain popular stories, in fact, most of the chapters cover obscure events, which makes it very interesting for true fans of this elite agency. I am afraid, however, that most people will not get much interest out of some of the chapters. I would have to disagree with Mr. Cox, and say that some of these stories really don't ""need telling""."
3,Texas Ranger Tales: Stories That Need Telling.,"If you enjoy Texas history or just history in general, this book is for you. If the author does not know the true facts, he will tell you so. You will find yourself looking forward to the next story. I enjoyed the book"
2,Not impressed!,I did expect top quality for what I paid but I didn't think it would start to fall apart as I put it on either. I put this seat cover on a bench seat of an old '63 Ford truck. The cover is a bit too big but I'm ok with that. The little plastic clips that hold the fastening straps together are a bit too delicate. The seams start to pull apart at any real pressure. I would hate to see what would happen if this were going on something that the cover would be a tight fit.
3,"Product didn't work, but Excellent customer service","Hat's off to Lund and Chris Fisher for her excellent customer service. I ordered this cover for my F250 and received in good condition, installed according to the directions (you need and in/lb torque wrench) and had an issue with the hinge clamps bending the top rail of my truck by the cab (not a big deal). So I called Lund International thinking I would get some help with the product, what I received blew my mind. They shipped me a different product at no cost to me and they didn't even ask for the cover I originally purchased back. Now that, is customer service. Thank you Lund!"
2,dry and unimaginative,"being a loyal forgotten realms fan, i was disappointed with greenwood's take on waterdeep. the story line never drew me in and the characters were one dimensional and largely uninteresting. would definitely not recommend this book - thank goodness he didn't write a trilogy."
1,Not their best...,"I was hoping for something great. Ed Greenwood and Elaine Cunningham together... Well, the prologue was awesome and I bought the book.Chapter after chapter, I was hoping for the story to get interesting... at last... to no avail.Not everything was bad. I learned some interesting things about the city and got the feel of some places at least.I will try to forget this book and fondly remember others I enjoyed so much."
5,A joint book from two awesome authors,"You can't go wrong with this book from The Forgotten Realms two very best authors. I couldn't say enough good things about this book so buy it, burrow it, just do something to get your hands on it. Go, sho, what are you whating for."
5,"This is a Novel, Not a Gaming Product","The previous reviewer, ""A Reader"" rated this at 5 stars, but is confused as to which product he was reviewing. He actually is referring to: ""City of Splendors: Waterdeep (Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting (D&D;): Core Rules) (Hardcover)by Eric L. Boyd"". Which is a gaming product for Dungeons and Dragons in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting in which the fictional city of Waterdeep is described in detail.I wanted to clear this up so that others here at Amazon wouldn't be confused as to what they are considering purchasing.Ed Greenwood and Elaine Cunningham are two fantastic authors who have come together to create a Forgotten Realms masterpiece. -- Enjoy."
3,Red Foxx is great this CD is lacking,"This is a cd of a classic Red Foxx act he did in the late '70s. I saw him live during the original tour this cd was drawn from. The comparison betweeen his true stage act and the material collected here is just barely the same. Yes, the cd is funny, yes Red is great, however it is far, far shorter than his act and many truly great parts have been left out. Even the title, which is the topic of the closing of his act has been chopped down to a mere fraction of what it was. If you never heard this material before, you might like it. If you are trying to remember a classic performance by a great, dont bother."
4,Swing slow and easy,"The other reviewers are too harsh on this CD -- listen to the sound samples and decide for yourself. Jason and the G-Men fill this CD, and their concerts, with a slower, piano-club sort of music. There's no trumpets or brass to blast out the swing, just a keyboard, a bass, and percussion, along with Jason's unique and relaxed voice.The title, I'll agree, is something of a misnomer -- you can't ""swing hard"" to these tunes, and it would probably be more accurate to call this jazz music than swing. But if you enjoy the likes of Harry Connick, Jr. or Indigo Swing, you'll be right at home with this disc."
4,Trend-free music,"Yay for Jason et al! This mixture of Jazz/Big Band and Swing is the real thing, not someone trying to jump into a trend: they've been doing it years before the ""swing craze."" Refugees from College Jazz Band, these guys have fun! Go for it!"
3,the number of the crease,"I can think of worse forms of entertainment than seeing a young Cheryl Ladd and Kate Jackson conspiring with a teacher incarnation of Satan in an all girls school.Comical, a little spooky and so so surreal.B-movie classic."
5,long life,"I first purchased a pair of chaco sandles some 20 years ago. I have never had any footwear that has lasted so long. I have worn them on 5 mile runs, 10 mile hikes in the sierra's, 10 mile river hikes in the santa cruz mountains. They have been excellent footing and comfort. My wife for fathers day bought me a new pair."
4,Love them!,"I bought these for my husband and he was reluctant to try them on because he doesn't like anything between his toes. After forcing himself to wear them for a day, he totally changed his mind about the shoes. He loves them! Awesome quality and very durable. The only complaint he has is that they are a little narrow for his feet (his feet are really wide). Other than that, awesome product!"
5,<3 Chacos,"I wear these more often than any other pair of shoes. They're terrific and comfortable and sturdy and awesome. I buy new ones as soon as my current pair starts to wear, so they're ready-in-waiting. Love 'em."
2,Tough but Heavy,Really well crafted sandals that most likely work well if you just wanted them for rafting or water activities but I find them too heavy and rigid to walk in for any long distance and they are way too heavy to pack if you are flying. I was really shocked how heavy they were.
3,"Heavy, uncomfortable.","Solid Sandal but rather uncomfortable, heavy and not quick to get in and out of. Haven't given them a fair chance to break in yet but have not enjoyed wearing them enough to keep them on long enough. Wanted a rugged sandal and this is it. More suited for hiking than lounging in summer months. Even in a boat I'd prefer Sperry (Gold) Topsiders.Very expensive footwear!! I'd look for a Tiva style with velcro straps next time for better comfort and quick onn/off capability."
5,good,good quality. also work for old lcds that need the mouse ear cord. nice quality. need to fill this space because of 20 wds requirement
1,Cable falls apart after a couple of months,"The cable worked fine for 1-2 months but then fell apart at the connections, despite using it only at home with minimal wear and tear. Soon after the interior wires were visible. Very unsafe! Shortly after this the cable broke completely. The quality is just not good."
5,Ebenezer,"This is a great movie with a little twist on the Christmas Carol. It is an old time western. I strongly recommend this movie. It was also delivered well before the deadline. Thank you, Jan."
4,EBENEZER--- A GENUINE DIFFERENCE,"I recently obtained a new VHS packaging for EBENEZER, the 1997 production and western adaptation for A CHRISTMAS CAROL. One of the reasonsI wanted this one is the fact long time bad boy Jack Palance was playing the title role, and I wanted to see how the familiar story would turnout as a western. I don't know why they don't bring this out on DVD, but I guess because maybe many other folks didn't like it. I personally foundPalance's Ebenezer a true genuine difference in this telling of the old Christmas Classic. It is superb; sometimes a bit hammy, but I guess the rest of thecast decided to have some fun in their respective roles. It's a different and refreshing change to the old familiar story."
3,2 stars for quality + 1 star for novelty!,"Okay, so the first thing I said while watching this film was ""So it's not Academy Award material"". No matter. I've seen many versions of Dicken's Christmas Carol. This one was novel and original, and that's saying something.. . . So for acting (especially on the part of the extras and bit parts) and the casting (of the female bit parts, stock hollywood filler types as opposed to real people) this film gets low marks. But for novelty and innovation this film garners the extra star. The Christmas Future sequence was especially creative. Ebeneezer didn't look at his own gravestone at some indeterminate time in the future -- He saw (and tried vainly to prevent) himself in a gunfight that would be happening the next day... And even that did not turn out in an obvious manner.. . . Palance does an excellent job as Ebeneezer, and it's good to see Rick Schroeder show up again after so many years. He's not Ford or Pheonix or Murray, but he's alright."
2,"mediocre quality, the casting of metal just looks plain cheap and it smells of a chinese import warehouse.","mediocre quality, the casting of metal just looks plain cheap and it smells of a chinese import warehouse.I have had several of the anchor mounts and these do not appear to have the exact same OE quality as advertised by Anchor Industries. You can tell by sight that the metal casting is inferior to the original, I can't speak about the rubber as it's entirely encapsulated.By the way, if you have a 1.8T or 1.9TDI VW with the Tiptronic 09A transmission that calls for the part 1J0-199-555-BB, THIS IS NOT THE CORRECT PART FOR YOU.good luck out there gearheads."
3,zitzap,zit zap came on time before est. arrival date. Product isnt a miracle working but i think works the same as any other pimple cream. Pleased.
3,Helps a bit with blackheads but not with zits,"I was excited to try this product because I have battled blackheads for my whole life. I tried the product on the blackheads on my nose and it seemed to help. However, I was disappointed when I got a monster zit right in the middle of my forehead. I slathered on Zapzyt at night and expectantly looked at my forehead in the mirror the next morning, only to discover that it was still there and as red as ever. I used it for the next 2 days, to no avail. I gave ZapZyt the benefit of the doubt, thinking that maybe this monster was just in a league of its own, but I tried it again when I got a smaller zit and it didn't work.I haven't given up on ZapZyt yet because all the other reviewers seem to really love this product and I really want to love this product too! I will post an update if it starts working for me (fingers crossed) or I figure out what I'm doing wrong."
3,This product did work better than the prescription ...,"This product did work better than the prescription benzoyl cream my doctor prescribed, however, I didn't find that it worked any better than other benzoyl peroxide products out there. It's good to have around just for those really bad breakouts."
2,nah... but yea,dry skin... good for normal acne but not to severe acne people.... recommend to see doctor and have acutane pill..
4,"The product worked well, however Clearasil is still ...","The product worked well, however Clearasil is still my number one choice for acne medication. This didn't work as well as Clearasil and it was more runny than Clearasil. If you don't have a bad acne problem, and this product is a lower cost than Clearasil, then I'd recommend this."
4,I was surprised at how quickly I noticed ...,"I was surprised at how quickly I noticed a difference. It was easy to use and didn't feel harsh on my skin. I've used blemish treatments before that left my skin red and sore. This was very mild, but seemed to have a quick effect on the blemishes. I was very pleased with the product and do plan to order again it once I run out."
1,This gel dried up my skin and caused redness.,"For those who have dry skin, please avoid at all cost. This will make your skin even drier. After applying this for three nights, I noticed my skin was relatively dry. When I wash my face in the morning, it irritating so I applied face moisturizer which did not help moisturized my skin. This is probably due to the active ingredient of benzoyl peroxide even though there is 10% in the tube."
2,Not what I had expected,"If you want a progressive cd disc set similar to Nocturnal Frequencies 3 - DON'T bother with this. I didn't enjoy this housy music, however, the track by Tantra almost makes up for this. Disappointed."
4,"dirty, housey, techno, disco, progressive,...its got it all","Danny Howells, an up and coming veteran to the dance scene shows off his skills with GU 27. I have never really heard Howells until now besides that he opened up for Digweed a number of occasions. Howell's broad range of musical style and creativity flourish on this 2CD set. CD 1 is more of a ""lighter, groovier"" set aimed at the early morning scene of the Terrace at Club Space. Cd2 is a little bit wilder and more clubbish. Both sets are seamlessly mixed, expecting no less from the GU series. I have been listening to house for a couple of years and I have never heard the different sounds that Howells puts on here. It is a very stylish cd that somewhat odd but still maintains the dirty, housey feel that Howell fans can relate with. This CD is a great addition to your GU collection."
4,Nice!! - Danny Howells (Miami),"GU #27 immediately preceedes GU #28 Nick Warren's Shanghai. Had I not heard Shanghai I would probably have rated this set a 5. However, this is a great compilation of some very good progressive tracks especially on Disc 1 i.e. Discotronic, Post Modern Sleaze & Road Through The Rain may be the highlights of this Set. Disc 2 is probably not as smooth flowing as Disc 1. Again, all in all this is a very good compilation and it is easy to say that those who like Shanghai will definately like this one."
4,Good Intro to Christian Apologetics,"Nash is a prominent Christian thinker and apologist. He is very lucid in his presentation and arguments and does a good job documenting the various views taken on the rationality of various religious beliefs.Here he tackles some of the bigger questions: Existence of God, problem of evil, miracles, etc. He starts with worldview and then expandis this them.A good choice, since most have a worldview,this is conducive to many understanding where he is coming from and where he wants to take the reader in this journey of coupling the faith with philosophy.Helpful intro with references for further study."
4,ordered the hard back for durability,Got this book for my 26 year old son who is into theology and he is thrilled with it; arrived in very good condition
3,decent,this game is ok. although it does not have much of a plot. i would recomend getting another game before buying this one.
4,Great for work & personal use,"These shades can take a beating & sit very comfortable on my face. Through time & abuse they will scratch but won't leave annoying noticeable scratches from the first drop. I hang them off my neck as they would sit on my face, & usually won't fall off from me working or moving around. I don't like the string hanging around my neck, but it does have holes so you can install them on these shades (not included). The package they're sold in is the only gripe I have. From it being moved around, they rub on the plastic packaging & can scratch right in the center of the lenses. Not sellers fault, just the way the main company packages them. My first came like that, but Amazon replaced them with no argument. Second pair was fine."
5,Great,For the price these glasses are great you can wear them all day long and feel completely comfortable with on.
1,worst movie ever.too dark to see,"i bought this movie to see some of the old buiildings at STAUNTON MILITARY ACADEMY CAMPUS where it was filmed after the ACADEMY CLOSED.THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF LIGTHING,(TO ADD TP THE SCARY MOOD?) SO THE VIEWER COULD NOT SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY TO BUY IT. THIS MOVIE WAS WORSE THAN ANY I HAVE EVER SEEN.DON'T BUY IT. !!!!"
4,art for everyone,"Great art book for kids of different ages. It gives great ideas that the kids can build on. This book would make a great birthday present with some washable stamp pads. Or, have the kids decorate blank envelopes and paper and give to relatives as as a gift."
3,I was disapointed.,"I bought this book because my son loves trains and is not very good at drawing. He is six years old. While I could follow the instructions, it was really rather complex for my son and the pictures were rather complex too. I wanted to help him make simple 6 year old drawings that he could be proud of and this wasn't the book to accomplish that.While alot of the drawings in the books simply require you to be able to make a triangle or a square etc, often it's a tiny traingle placed in an obscure part of the picture. You are also required to change color to follow along step by step or you can get lost, instead of just being able to draw the out line in one color first, then filling in the details. This was just too complex for what I was trying to accomplish."
2,Not for a five year old,"I bought this book for my five year old boy. Based on the description, it sounded age appropriate. However, it was a little advanced for him so we returned it. Maybe better for eight and up."
5,Don't I Have This One Already?,"That's the feeling I had when I received this as a present but, nope, I was wrong: I had the THUMBprint drawing book. And there's very little duplicatioin between this book and the thumb book!Same premise and target audience, though: If your kids have fingers, they can draw! If they're very young, you can draw the details, but if they can hold a pencil, they can probably add the simple shapes and forms to make their own pictures.The more drawing I do with kids, the more I realize how these books develop skills. They're a perfect gradient for youngsters just sitting down to draw. The books tell them what shapes to add, and it's a matter of duplicating those shapes in the right places--a skill one needs for more realistic drawing.This is a great starter for a series of books that your kids will enjoy for years and will give them a comfort level and basic skill set they can use to make more sophisticated drawings later, if they want."
4,Great For Your Older Artist,"This is a book that uses stick figures and basic shapes to help children learn to draw more complicated pictures. This is an interactive book to teach drawing. Every little artist will enjoy the simple step-by-step drawings and colorful illustrations that Ed Emberley's Drawing Book of Trucks and Trains contains. Smaller children will learn new words while their older siblings can use the book to learn how to draw more complicated pictures than just stick figures. However, it is somewhat difficult for the four-year-old child. An age recommendation on the book itself would make buying the book a little easier for parents and gift-giving relatives."
4,Fun with shapes and figures,"Every little artist will enjoy the simple step-by-step drawings and colorful illustrations that Ed Emberley's Drawing Book of Trucks and Trains contains. Smaller children will learn new words while their older siblings can use the book to learn how to draw more complicated pictures than just stick figures. While Mr. Emeberley works with some stick figure designs, he cleverly weaves in triangles, circles, rectangles and squares to make learning fun and easy. An age recommendation on the book itself would make buying the book a little easier for parents and gift-giving relatives. While amazon shows an age of 4-8, it was too complicated for my almost four-year-old son to use. It is, however, a book that children that age could grow into with time.Christine Louise Hohlbaum, author of DIARY OF A MOTHER (2003)SAHM I AM: TALES OF A STAY-AT-HOME MOM IN EUROPE (2005), resides with her husband and two children near Munich, Germany."
4,Sweet and clever ideas!,"This book has some VERY cute and clever ideas. The instructions are simple, clear and easy to follow (hooray!)I had purchased this book to use for ideas involving my toddler and pre-schooler but they are a liiiiittle too complicated for that to work well...however for slightly older kids it would be GREAT!I discovered that washable markers applied directly to the thumbpad/fingerpad make one perfect print and then there is almost nothing left on the finger (so you don't 'find' finger prints on random surfaces around your house)...it leaves the print just where you want it on the paper but little mess to clean-up otherwise (hooray again!)Lots of cute creative ideas and I strongly recommend this book :D"
5,Love it.,I have one grandson that loves to draw so I bought him several of these drawing books. He loves the fact that it gives him step by step instructions on how to draw something which gives him the confidence to try even more by himself.
4,Pics a little small,Considering the age group the pictures could have been larger to better suit the recipient. But a fun guide for drawing.
5,Another good book on fingerprint drawing,"I bought this book for a very talented young lady, who is interested in arts and crafts. She has a great imagination and this book has increased awareness of possibilities that exist in all types of drawing."
5,Loved the books,I know my grandson will love these books. I used Ed E. books when I taught school. Great for beginners.
4,White Ladder,This is music from the albulm of the same name. I was hoping that it would be in piano style formate. The music is in guitar tabulature. There is a lot of good piano music on the albulm so I am a little disappointed about that. I have just started to play the guitar music in the book and it is very nice. I would recommend the book to anyone who enjoys Mr. Gray's music and have a desire to learn how to play it.
3,Rigorous but not complete,"I am a materials science engineer and read this book to learn about diamond-like carbon, which is a disordered material. This book covers a lot of topics, and ues a fair deal of equations and figures. It adequately covers most topics about disordered materials, though I could not find much information about diamond-like carbon. I would not recommend this book as an introductory text on the subject, but it is good for a reference. The text assumes the reader has fairly good knowledge of geometry, math, and solid state science, along with materials science. Much of the text could be rewritten to make it more readable, without reducing content."
3,It was good but not what I thought it would be,"It was excellent as a book to show the piecing techniques, but I was looking for slightly different patterns. Nothing wrong with the but I just didn't see what I was looking for"
3,Binding came apart :(,This has been very helpful in my entering the SCA. I have been able to look at various centuries and get a good overview of what people from different regions would have been wearing. Very fun and helpful.Only problem--the book began falling apart the first time I opened it. It appears to be rather cheaply made (the glue on the binding did not hold and approx 10 pages fell away from the binding). I wasn't very bothered by it since it is just a fun game/play reference for me. I have even considered punching holes at putting it in a three ring binder but if you plan on cherising it for a keepsake be wary.
3,I read all three,"I read all three in the series(the daughter of the red deer, the horse masters, and reindeer hunters) in sequence. I was able to follow all the characters and refer back as a result. While all three were written to be enjoyed independently, I think it was more enjoyable the way I did it. I am now a fan of Joan Wolf and look forward to more prehistorical fiction from her. I have read all of Jean Auel's book in the children of the earth series as well as Kathleen and Michael Gear's north American prehistorical series and believe that anyone who liked those would enjoy these three novels."
2,Not for the average singer,I am a purely recreational singer. I was looking for a text to help me improve my singing. What I found here was an overly technical book more suited to a college classroom. It contains diagrams and pictures of the vocal mechanism and I'm sure it is a useful reference for those studying to teach voice. I would not recommend it for individuals simply looking for tips on reaching their maximum vocal potential. A difficult read!
1,If publisher has to apologize for quality of reprint I don't need.,"Let it be known that Kessinger Publishing sourced this reprint from Google Books. Every page has Google printed at the bottom. Why they chose this particular edition to reprint eludes me. It isn't the most complete or a first edition or the most beautiful or cleanest scanned or superlative in any way. It has all the faults of the original scan such as underlined words, plus some defects of their own printing process added. Also the binding appears to be just glued together.The publisher states that ""This important reprint was made from an old and scarce book. Therefore, it my have defects such as missing pages, erroneous pagination, blurred pages, missing text, poor pictures, markings, marginalia and other issues beyond our control."" This information should have been made available before purchase."
4,"""...a faultless piece to see...""",With a small quote from Alexander himself as the title I clearly state my approval! His works are unlike anything I have read in early English Literature. His very original attitude and way of speaking his mind makes him who he is. A must read for any reader who wants to be entertained!
2,Fairly disappointing,"I bought this anthology based on the two positive reviews from other purchasers. Four stars seemed like a pretty good recommendation. However, I received the book yesterday and was fairly disappointed. Many of the songs are quite poorly done, and all of them are much too simple. Big Yellow Taxi, for instance, has several chords that are clearly not correct and sound nothing like the ""real"" version. I thought Circle Game was the best rendition overall, but other than that, I wouldn't bother purchasing this. I have not bought any other Joni Mitchell book, but if this is the best out there, then I think I've just discovered a niche in the market....I'll be off writing my own, and accurate, version of these songs!"
2,Completely Inaccurate Transcriptions,"Don't fall victim to the falsely positively rated reviews. Though somewhat comprehensive, the transcriptions featured in this anthology are blatantly inaccurate and do not directly reflect Ms.Mitchell's beautiful songwriting capabilities. River, my favorite, is horribly off, using a major C chord for the beginning piano solo. Do not bother purchasing, unless you want to rip your ears off each time you attempt playing these transcribed ""versions""."
2,Why you're not happy with the chords....,"The reason for the above reviewer's disappointment in the chords of the Joni Mitchell books is easy to explain; They are not the original chords. Why? Because Joni has had no formal training and has literally made her own tuning up as she goes along. That's why it sounds so refreshingly dreamy and unique. It's like tuning to an open D: notice how frequently she plays chords by just barring the fret board from ABOVE...not reaching around the neck from under neath? Bear in mind that SOME of her books will actually take the trouble to diagram each tuning for each song. Most though, do not."
5,Anthology by: Joni Mitchell,I love it! Was easy to read and play. I lost my copy in a flood a few years back and had to replace it.LOVE JONI!~Onna~Still need to replace Hejira songbook
2,"Just Another ""Blame the Victim"" Book...","Not sure why people like Dionisi miss this important point (perhaps criticizing the Bush Administration is just to tempting to pass up?), but the reason 9/11 occurred isn't U.S. foreign policy or George Bush's obvious stupidity...it's religion. If you choose to read this book, contrast it with something by Christopher Hitchens and get a feel for what it leaves out. Yes, Bush and his cronies are after oil. Yes, U.S. foreign policy needs to be changed. But, bin Laden and his gang of thieves are motivated by a typical Muslim hatred of all things non-Muslim. This book provides a one-sided, myopic view of a very complex issue, and manages to do something that is all too common with today's liberals...it blames the victim."
5,Garfield Reading 3rd Grade,Purchased this for a young boy that was having trouble in school. with this program he was able to be more successful in school.
5,If you are serious about global marketing strategies,"This book is not for people who are seeking for magic formulas to achieve global marketing success. It compiles scientific articles from top academic researchers. As a whole, these papers can provide a broader view of global markets, as well as invaluable insights for marketing managers. A must for students, professors, marketing managers and entrepreneurs. The article from Sumantra Ghoshal and Christopher Bartlett, entitled ""Building the entrepreneurial corporation: new organisational processes, new managerial tasks"", is one of the highlights of this book."
5,Classic,"While this is not Cirillo's most recent offering, it is still a classic. In this video you will learn the gunfighting secrets that helped NYPD Stakeout Squad veteran Jim Cirillo prevail in more than a dozen gunfights with New York City's most vicious criminals and hear the stories of these amazing encounters as only he can tell them."
1,Terrible product terrible company - No Stars,"HP put me through the ringer on this one. The did send me a replacement but it didn't work either. They kept us on the support line for hours. Faxing, shipping, etc etc. Then wouldn't refund the $80. It was a Christmas present for my son for God's sake. Unbelievable company. It never worked from the get go. I will never buy an HP product again.I don't even want to give it one star. NO STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,VERY GOOD,"VERY GOOD EXPLANATION OF THE E-BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE CONCEPTS, GOOD EXAMPLES OF ACTUAL APPLICATIONS AND AN INTERESTING ROADMAP INTO ITS FUTURE. GOOD BUY."
2,You get what you pay for...,"In the interest of full disclosure, which I think should be required for these reviews; I have implemented Business Objects among other BI applications on both a small and huge enterprise scale. You'll find the reviews for this book, including mine, very polarized. I believe it has a lot to do with your BI product bias. This book was written by a Business Objects executive. It doesn't take a scientist to figure out where the author is coming from. Fortunately I can say I didn't pay for the book, it was given to me by a Business Objects sales rep. Otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.The book does offer sound generalization of concepts so it's not a total loss if you're just getting into the technology. On the other hand, if you're looking for real strategy and implementation best practices, there are better resources available."
2,Not enough details to be useful,"I found this book to be very weak in details and concepts. It's easy to say that companies need business intelligence and throw around some very vague and general facts and examples. And that's what this book does. The case studies offer no details at all. If you've never heard of e-business or intelligence (basically if you've been living in a cave) then this book will introduce the topic at a high level. But if you're looking for more information you'd better look some place else. I know the author is the founder of Business Objects, but I just expected more from this book and was very disappointed."
3,C.A. Mobley Book(s),"I enjoyed this book, as I enjoy all of C.A. Mobley's books. It is good, light entertainment. Her plots are a little far fetched in that the protagonist ends up having way too much influence on events for her station in life, but the books are engaging nonetheless. The writing is good and the reader can easily visualize the scenes. The action is fast-paced and the reader's attention is held to the end. I understand that C. A. Mobley is a pseudonym for an author who writes three different series under three different names. Look her up on the Internet and enjoy her other series, too."
4,Code of Conflict,"Skipped around some to start, but tied in very well. You could really feel for the characters! Overall a very good read !"
1,The author showcases his lack of knowledge,"This book was a disappointment. I wasn't expecting much, but the writing is at a low standard and is not fit for publishing. It was a boring read and I now know what to expect from Mobley. Sorry I wasted even a dime on this trash."
3,"""Code of Conflict""--A Short Review","Mobley's work is diverting...Not bad for reading on a flight or other commute. It is not, however, representative of the best of the genre. The quality of the editing and proof-reading is poor and the book is way off-base on many technical points. My advice: Don't worry about details, just enjoy the book and see how many discrepancies you can find."
1,It's a Lie,"I've owned this product for a couple of years now. It is the drum for my Brother HL-1040. Brother has a nice setup where you purchase the toner cartridges separate from the drum. According to Brother, the drum prints 20,000 sheets before it needs replacing. So, you get 20,000 sheets and then you can either spend the $160 on a new drum, or just buy a new printer.Let me say that if you get 5,000 printed sheets from this drum you are doing better than most people. Brother lies to their customers when they claim this drum produces 20,000 printed sheets....it just doesn't happen. And at those prices for a replacement? These are deceptive claims that try to justify the price on a new drum.This product should be avoided if possible."
1,"Brother, is this worth it?","I decided not to buy the replacement drum, because the first drum only lasted for a few thousand pages, about a year. It is almost as cheap to buy a new laser printer, but it won't be a Brother. The drums wear out too fast. I have bought three brothers and each one was worse than the last. I am going to give Samsung a try."
4,Awesome,"This album, along with 'Uptown', are great!This early G.B. is incredible for guitarists and jazz buffs,and Ronnie Cuber adds SMOKING bari sax.I could live without the vocal cut(all of me), and some of the tunes are somewhat dated, but all in all, this recording displays a side of George Benson that most people never know about. Sure, he was a pop star in the '80s, but this album solidifies his place in Jazz Guitar superstardom!"
4,George Benson Cookbook (1966),"This is a jazz organ-guitar combo release with Lonnie Smith on organ and Ron Cuber on saxophone. It makes sense after ""The Boss Guitar of George Benson"" (1964) recorded with the Jack McDuff group.Out of the ten released tracks, I loved the first two fast songs, ignored the third slow song, skipped the quick vocal on ""All Of Me"", and enjoyed listening to the six remaining tracks. So I rate this album as a keeper, because 80% of songs are good. But I actually like all the tracks, the easy guitar bossa nova is nice and the up-tempo vocal track is also enjoyable.So I would recommend this to anyone who likes instrumental jazz organ-guitar combo (like Captain Jack McDuff) songs."
4,A must for bebop guitar nuts,"I am a jazz guitarist and I've bought a whole bunch of jazz guitar albums. This one is one of my favorites for pure bebop, smokin', freakin', maniac playing. Who can blame George for becoming a star singer? He has a great voice, and he made a gazllion bucks (which he wouldn't have playing guitar). Top pro jazz guitarists everywhere probably sighed a collective sigh of relief when he took that detour. What makes George special, for me, is that he has all the facility and harmonic sophistication of any jazz guitarist, but he also has a strong, funky, blues thread that permeates the air. Sometimes jazz guitar can be a bit too cerebral, but not if you have a deep sense of the blues, and a bad ass swagger in your playing. George is about as smokin' a jazz guitarist as you'll ever hear and this one is a hell of a lot of fun.** I've already posted the exact same review under George's ""It's Uptown"" album because it's more of the same. Buy both."
5,Real Jazz!,"I've owned this album for over 25 years (LP). This is George at his best, before becoming commercial. Real bebop, and great chops. No ""Breezin"" or ""On Broadway"" commercial junk. Get this album, and also ""It's Uptown"" if you want to hear George before money transformed him :-)"
3,Tina Baby,"I can think of only one reason to purchase this package, Tina Russel. She's in two of the movies and she does her thing"
5,Defiantly a 'crown jewel' of a book ;),"I had the paperback version of this book years ago, but never got it back after lending it to a friend. So when I got a kindle for Christmas, this was one of the first books that came to my mind, and I loved it just as much as I did before!! Normally I would say stick with the classic ND' s but this one is really in a league of it's own. It has all the sassy detective you would expect from ND with some extra twists and turns that make a great thriller! (Though gauging Nancy's reactions, I think she could have done without the drama ;) I definitely recommend this book to all ND fans and to anyone that has a nose for mysterious and excitement! XD"
5,The Chocolate-Covered Contest,This is a really good book.I would highly recommend this book to Chocolate lovers! It makes you want to read all night long.It is a real page turner!You will find out about Nancy's adventures at a chocolate factory and an amusment park.Nancy's friend Bess gets a million dollar wrapper! But when Bess and Nancy go to recieve the prize they find out someone has already won it!You will have to read this book to find out what else happens...
3,The Chocolate-Covered Contest talks to much about Chocolate!,"The chocolate-covered contest talks too much about chocolate. It is an exciting book, and I liked it. But it really talks too much about chocolate!"
3,head trip,"long, interesting, insane, warped, well put together, unbelievable, shows ted danson's range as an actor. most of all.... unique."
5,A Conductor's Dream!,"This book is a valuable resource for any choral conductor. The techniques outlined by Marie Stultz can be applied to any choir - not just a children's choir. As a singer and teacher, I am going to share this book with many colleagues. And the CD is a pure delight!"
5,Read this book if you truly want to understand,"This book is a must-read for anyone truly interested in understanding the truth about the roots and causes of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and how this has been distorted by an irresponsible and sensationalist media under pressure by the ratings race and by lobbies and special interest groups. This book is an extremely important piece of work in outlining the power the media has to distort and misrepresent world events, particularly in a region as misunderstood as the Middle East. It is astounding that such a small group of people can have such a large impact on the way the majority of the population understands and views the world. This book is a seminal piece of work that will hopefully open the door to a better understanding of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the world's most misunderstood conflict, and to the honest reporting of it."
1,A surprising perspective,"I have absolutely no doubt that Greg Philo is totally sincere in his belief that his research came up with the conclusion that the media is biased in favour of IsraelI am equally sure that the findings are completely wrong!Totting up the number of minutes devoted to Israeli or Palestinian spokespeople does not amount to the words actually relating to support of the particular group you represent.To those of us who believe the bias is completely the other way, Greg Philo's findings come as a complete surprise and even a spokesperson for the BBC has questioned the veracity of the way the research has been interpreted.There are so many examples of anti Israel journalists and electronic media reporters, that it is truly hard to understand how this book has used the evidence availableJoy WolfeManchester UK"
3,Excellent substitute for the movie,"Really fun quotes from the movie, don't really need the orchestral soundtrack though. Also, it's not in chronological order. With all my complaints, it was worth the money to have them singing the theme song. Love that!"
3,Using because Dr Oz said,"I'm drinking oolong tea because Dr Oz said it would raise metabolism, the jury is still out.......really how would you know? I have lost weight but that's because I quit drinking coffee which I added too much cream to and started working out a lot more. It does not taste the all that great so I add 3 equals and drink it after it cools."
5,A whole new view of medical systems,"Andrew Weil's book was assigned as supplmental reading in a sociology of health and healing systems course at Park College in Southern California. With phrases like, ""nothing works all the time and everything works some of the time,"" Andrew explored health systems worldwide from accupuncture in China to witchdoctors in Latin America. The idea that Western doctors actually gain much of their credibility not because of their own skills, but because they take credit for what the body already does is interesting. Health and medicine previously seemed like a highly scientific study, but viewed from Andrew's perspective, it is, in many ways, philosophically and culturally specific. Andrew brings a whole new world to medicine. Fascinting perspective."
2,"Too sweet, Too ""Produced""","It should be said first of all that this is a quality recording. Clearly, the producers put a lot of work into it. This is the only reason I give it more than one star.That said, it is the antithesis of Buddhist chant. The music is overproduced, too lush and much too saccharine. It is the audio equivalent of a big hunk of birthday cake.Unless that's what you were hoping for, I would advise potential buyers to look elsewhere. Very disappointing."
2,"Han Shan, help us","I'll have to admit this is a somewhat relaxing cd for what's its worth, and the first track is rather nice. However, I find myself shutting this music off after a few minutes because after a while they keep repeating the same phrase over and over. I know, I know that's what chants are about. HOWEVER, don't let the cover trick you, the little monk in front and others like him are no where to be heard singing on the CD. This seems more like a small studio setup with electronic instrumental backup, with a male and female duo singing lullabye"
4,Settles my class down,"I bought this disk to try and bring some calm energy to an otherwise hostile and negatively charged environment. I find that in playing it lowly in the background, my fifth graders are more focused and relaxed, less likely to get aggressive with one another. I imagine if you were simply sitting and listening to it, it would be boring, but it makes for soothing background noise for myself and my students."
1,color is not as pictured,I ordered these to match a wedding dress. The color in real is not the same as pictured. the shoe is a comfortable shoe and for a great price. If it's still available I may exchange for a black one.
3,Repeat Midnight,"I love the music of Thelonious Monk, but in this big band setting the arrangements are a bit bombastic. The only thing that really stands out is Monk's piano, playfull as ever, twirling around. Suggestion: play the last song of the album again and again and again and again and... His solo Round Midnight is one of the highlights of 20th century music. And that's even an understatement (I really like it)."
4,Mindless - and Good,"Mindless action entertainment - and good. Fantastic martial arts and car chase scenes, clever plotting, and excellent acting by the ensemble casts in both filmsmake them highly entertaining. When you need a little adrenalin boost, these films can be just the thing."
1,"Not Erotic, Not Tantra","This video is also being sold as Tantra Massage. Don't waste your money. It is neither erotic or tantra. As a nationally certified massage therapist, I can say that it demonstrates basic Swedish massage techniques for relaxation massage well. Unfortunately there is no dialogue and no explanations or instructions are given. As a practitioner of Tantric sex, I can say there very little Tantra involved in this video. Genital massage of both male & female is demonstrated, but not particulary well. If you wanted an instructional video - you will be disappointed. If you wanted an erotic video - you will also be disappointed. The Tao of Sexual Massage is a much better video."
4,Better than some.,"I picked this up because I wanted something new and I like Steve Coogan. It may not be the best movie I've ever seen, but it's deffinately better than some of the stuff out there. It's clever, funny, and if not entirely original at least it's entertaining and fast paced. I'll admit I'm still not quite sure what Rebecca Romijn's character is there for other than to dress in white and be sexy. If you're looking for a decent Friday night movie this is a pretty good bet."
2,Poor showing,"I like Steve Coogan, and Rebecca Romijn is easy on the eyes (even if she's made to look 7 feet tall in this movie), but this flick- as promising as it sounded- was just not up to snuff. It was kind of as if they were trying to mix a Guy Ritchie movie with the Sting, but it just didn't work. And even though Steve Coogan is a hilarious comedian, this wasn't funny in the least. Why cast one of the world's best comedians in a dull, half-hearted gangland adventure? Without any laughs, the convoluted plot and implausible romance failed to hold up this lead balloon. Someone give Mr. Coogan some material he can work with!"
4,Truly Funny,This is a truly funny. One of the best films I have seen recently. The ending is completely unpredictable.
3,"No laughs, but nice premise","If this is a comedy, someone forgot to put in something funny. Still, it's an interesting premise movie, and the 'plot,' such as it is, nicely builds up to a complicated grand finale that made me wonder just one thing: who exactly got shot at the hotel? The film isn't clear on that point, or was it just me? This could be a direct to dvd movie, though it does have some big names. It moves along fairly well."
3,not as good as you guys praised,"not quite a likable british guy doing an unlikely shady alibi business in l.a., hiring another p.r. lady to cover his back is a nice touch, pretty but too tall for this guy. to hire such a pretty young lady who clueless but conveniently falls for you without obvious reasons is not but a pipe dream. to watch this cliched (mob, latino gang bangers, hitmen, hotel floors and room numbers mess ups and so on) action comedy and accept it as ridiculous as it goes, you've got to turn your brain dead first."
1,Author needs a Master of the English language,"I am with the other reviewer. The synopse on the back of the book was better written than the ENTIRE book. If I could have given it zero stars I would have.The book had a plot that while albeitly far-fetched, caught my attention and sounded interesting to me as a reader of erotic fiction and especially BDSM fiction.Sadly, the utter lack of editing, poor language choice and spelling and grammatical errors made this book a nightmare to read.How many times can a person use the word ""Ummmm"" to express sexual pleasure. It made me nauseous.It was so bad, I couldnt get past the errors to lose myself in the story and I am really unsure how anyone else could, unless this is the state to which our english language has deteriorated.I seriously debated writing to the publishing company and offering my services as an editor, thats how distracting the grammatical errors and poor writing were.I will NOT be buying another book by this author."
4,Master,I liked the book. Encouraged me to buy the next two. The writer in me picked it apart. Alot of typos and grammer errors. Would continue with the series.
4,Great for the Bugaboo but items get lost in the bottom!,"I love this bag for ease of use with my Bugaboo - it attaches to the handlebars easily and keeps my personal items close to me as I push the stroller. It looks good and is easy to carry over my shoulder. It wipes down easily inside and out, and the inside pockets are handy.I don't like the way that because of the long shape of the bag, items get 'lost' in the bottom if the bag is full. I often have to tip everything out just to find what I need. On those occasions when you have to get to something quickly and easily, it is a pain. But by not filling it too much, you can avoid that situation.Beware the clips that attach the bag to the stroller handlebars...they need to be clipped back onto themselves to prevent them from falling off when you remove the bag. I lost one and it cost a lot to replace them.Overall a good stroller bag, but not for someone who wants to carry loads of stuff around."
2,I Quit,"The graphics and story are fantastic, but the driving sequences are absolutely horrible, and the controls overall are just bad. EVERY vehicle in this game drives like a seven horsepower go cart.Even more annoying, in my opinion, is the constant character switching. Jack Bauer is the coolest character, the character that I most enjoyed playing, but so far I've only spent 1/4 of the time in his shoes. Too much of the time is spent acting out the adventures of peripheral characters that aren't very exciting.At this point, I'm giving it up without finishing because it's not worth it. I'm very dissappointed."
3,"Great story, poor gameplay","As a die-hard 24 fan, I loved playing this, if only to watch the storyline featuring the voices and character models of beloved characters from earlier seasons of the show. The graphics work fine, and the audio is nice, but the gameplay is pretty awful at times - especially on the driving stages. Casual fans and non-24 gamers may want to give it a pass - this is only for those who really need their Bauer fix."
4,FAN OF 24? MUST BUY IT,If you enjoy the series you will love the game... as simple as that. Very entertaining. Don't miss it.
4,New season of 24.,"It's like a lost season. The story line for 24 the game, could have aired as another season. The game play follows the story, with some long but compeling dialogue between mission. Each mission has a purpose and an urgency that only 24 can bring you."
3,24 The Game,This game starts out very well. It's very exciting and fun to play. I did get bogged down at one point in the game. I was unable to complete this one section of the game after many attempts. So I ultimately put the game back in the box and gave up.
4,Great fun for a fan of the show,"If you're a fan of the show, then there's a good chance you'll like the game. The great thing about the game is the HUGE variety in each level. It's part 3rd person shooter, part driving, part problem-solving, all rolled into one. On top of that, you hardly ever play as the same character from level to level. They also did a great job with cut-scenes. You'll swear you're watching an actual animated episode of the show.There are drawbacks though. The targetting system is a bit weak. The gameplay is also a bit linear, which is surprising given the open-ended premise of the show.All together, it's a solid game."
4,a solid game graphics and story wise.,this game nails the shows presentation to a t. like i said in the title the graphics and story are very good. that combined with the voice acting and presentation make this game a lot better than it really is. it's a little on the short and simple side. i found i enjoyed it the more i got into it. it combines several gameplay styles. some are good and some are not so good(driving). but the shooting levels and sniper level is a blast. if you're a fan you can't go wrong with this game. if not maybe a rent would be better to see how you might like it. overall though the positives outweigh the negatives and will keep you hooked til the end.
2,Thin Tees,So thin I couldn't believe it..Not like the ones I ordered last time..they were Hanes tagless..I think The Texas T-Shirt company has gone down hill..Cheap shirts.Not the ounces they say.These were Fruit of the Loom.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"Don't get me wrong, Fruit of the Loom makes good t-shirts. I bought some undershirt Ts and they were great, and ALL COTTON. These are advertized as ""100% cotton."" Last I checked, that meant ALL cotton, nothing else. These are, according to the label on the shirts themselves, ""90% cotton, 10% polyester."" I specifically do not want any polyester in a cotton t-shirt. While it makes them more durable, it also makes them warmer. One wears t-shirts when? In warm to hot weather, when one does not need something warmer.Any seller that falsely advertises their products should not be in business, period, and does not deserve yours.Fruit of the Loom's website states that the material content of the shirts may vary with color, though they do not provide information on what color is what composition. At least they warn you that not all the shirts are all cotton."
3,Cotton is too heavy weight for me.,"I expected a lighter weight of cotton. Here in NM, the heat is too hot for a heavy T-Shirt. I kept them for winter time but really need a lighter weight cotton T-Shirt, still."
4,famed in China,"This book is very famed in China.The reader of the book is not college student but postgraduate.The publisher in China have translated and published the textbook for above 4 times, The lasted one in 16th edition.i am a editor.who can help me that i want to know the top 10 or 20 business textbook in the world? it's including Economics?liuhui@wise-link.com"
4,Does the job,This houses your guitar and I have a couple humidipaks in there because I live in a northern desert. Not many frills to this bag. It does the job.
5,Exactly what you would expect,"This bag is exactly what you would expect when you read Epiphone gig bag. Nothing more, nothing less. Perfect for my epiphone les paul."
1,I bought this for a Epiphone SG as listed,"Not even close to fitting my guitar. sorry : ( maybe my ukelele? not recommended. Said they would replace this, not recieved in over a month."
2,Bare Minimum,"As the title states, this is a lightly padded duffle bag, nothing more. If you're toating between practice with an instructor, it's okay. I purchased it for that reason...and I'm an adult, so I can be careful. This bag is useless for kids as a drop would likely result in damage. I would even go so far as to call it a glorified dust rag. It will prevent my guitar from scuffs, dings, dent & dirt, but that's it.There are better gig bags at a comprable price and the only reason I gave it two stars was becuase of the dirt cheap price."
1,Epi Gig Bag,"I returned the bag. I purchased it in anticipation of purchasing a Les Paul, but I eventually purchased a Epiphone Dot Studio. I returned the gig bag for exchange."
5,Soccer Yasmin,"This is a very pretty bratz doll. I should know, I have her! She comes in a blue 3 shirt, and she includes a soccer bag and ball. Her braided hair is golden brown,and her ears are pierced with blue earrings in them. also, she has orange, blue, and white soccer kleats, and socks. You must buy her!! You won't regret it! Well, maybe a little bit,since she only has one outfit:)"
5,This Doll Has It!,"Okay, My real name is Yasmin and I Love Soccer....People say I look alot like this doll lol...However, As far as educational value is concerned in response to ""a Kids review"" I would have to say this doll is, well; The girl is in a mini skort. I don't know how many girls play soccer in those. She isn't exactly wearing shin guards either, more like holey knee socks. They do match her cletes though. The ball is probably a size three, (way below standard size.)Since she is still in the box, I would have to take a guess at her durability. Her overall frame seems strong, just her hair seems pretty delicate; it can easily get frazzeled.Overall, I think this doll is hot. Her soccer uniform is co ordinated and she does have the basic gear. Her make-up is pretty and her bag makes her appear as very professional. As well, It doesn't hurt that she's like a mini me :p"
3,MGA skimped on the acessories here.,"You really do not get as much as usual here. She should have warms ups, a water bottle, soccer slides, a ball net , lip gloss and a better outfit. there is a reason Soccer moms drive those big vans. It takes lots of equipment to play soccer.At least they gave her shin guards. Poor Yasmin will have to borrow what else she needs from the other players ."
1,Oh. My. God.,"Do MGA seriously think girls wear SKIRTS to play football in. They should have given Yasmin some long shorts or whatever. Also, the writing on the back of the box says ""it's not how you play, it's how good you look when you win"", but it matters how you play because otherwise HOW DO YOU WIN. and who cares how good they look when they win the point is that they won and they should feel proud that they did so well, not proud that they look so 'hot in their microskirt'.Signed,A Bratz Fan But Doesn't Like This Doll"
5,So cute for soccer,"I have this doll and she is absolutely great!Well,she does`nt barely have any of accesories.all she comes with is a soccer ball, a sticker,and a soccer bag.When they have an extra outfit is when I like dim more.But you may like this doll more than me but I like dis doll.It`s a good doll if you collect it."
5,"A good value, and a great place to start","I was only casually aquainted with Mary Chapin Carpenter's music before picking up this album. The hits I knew were all here, and so was a lot more material I have come to love as well. I was a bit leery that ""Down at the Twist and Shout"" was a live version from the Super Bowl; this song was the primary reason I wanted a MCC album, and I was concerned a live version recorded in a stadium during the Super Bowl might be of inferior recording quality. But I needn't have worried, the sound is great, and the performance is energetic and fun, with a verse in Creole thrown in for good measure. ""This Shirt"" is probably my favorite track I was unfamiliar with, but the entire album is quality; there are very few 17-track albums by any artist where I can say I enjoyed every song. I now look forward to exploring her original albums. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for an introduction to this great artist."
3,"Good, but not great!","A significant portion of this album is taken from her ""Come On, Come On"" album, straight. There are some great songs on this album - the lullabye recording, and first song recorded with on the Letterman Show are personal favorites. I don't disagree with her selection of songs, but wish more were live recordings or new songs. If I had to do it over, I'd still buy this, but I agree with other comments that this seems like more of a grab bag, and less a cohesive story."
5,Excellent collection of new live material and old favorites.,"This album is a welcome addition to my collection. There are several new versions of previously released songs including a very nice live version of ""Stones in the Road"". Also not to be missed is a beautiful version of the John Lennon song ""Grow Old with Me"". Highly recommended."
2,"Compilation is ok, but vapid live performances hurt her.","I just saw her in concert, and she is getting better on stage, but still no world beater. The tracks she chose for the live takes on this CD are somehow less thrilling than what I saw recently, and the studio work is still her best bet. Great band, and nice songwriting. She is still better than a lot of what is out there today."
3,"""Greatest Hits""...Sort Of","This is like a greatest hits compilation, but I wasn't a huge fan of the live tracks. I recommend ""Playlist"" or ""The Essential"" if you want a hits album."
2,"Good, but not great","She needs to stick to the studio stuff. She isn't nearly as strong on stage, and these live versions show up her weakness in that area."
5,Worth the wait,"As a longtime fan of Mary Chapin, I have been waiting patiently for this cd to be released and man was it worth the wait. On it, she includes her trusty old standards that made her a star and then some obscure and beautiful songs that we might not have had the opportunity to hear. I, was also pleased to see that she managed to include me on the cd, well sort of. I had the priviledge of being in the audience when the song ""I Take my Chances"" was recorded last year in Madison. So for you folks that are old fans or to those that are just discovering this woman's amazing gift, get this cd, and maybe get a better understanding of her music and to some degree her thinking. My only complaint, she sang this beautiful romantic ballad at the show in Madison that was not included. Maybe next time!"
3,"LOVE YA MARY, BUT STICK TO THE STUDIO!","IT WAS NICE TO SEE SOUNDTRACK AND DEDICATION TRACKS INCLUDED ON THIS COLLECTION. ALSO THE 3 NEW STUDIO CUTS ARE PRETTY GOOD, BUT THE LIVE COVERS OF SOME OF HER HITS ARE NOWHERE AS GOOD AS THE ACTUAL STUDIO VERSIONS. ALTHOUGH THE SLOWED-DOWN VERSION OF 'QUITTIN TIME' IS INTERESTING IF NOT HAUNTING AT TIMES!! PS: LOVE THE SONG 'DREAMLAND'!!!"
5,Throw your head back and sing....,"Just as the opening line says, this album is full of music to sing to. Esp Almost Home. It is a wonderful album. To be honest, I bought this album on a whim and am glad I did! I own no other Mary Chapin Carpenter CD's but after this I will be sure to buy anything else she does. She puts a lot into her music and that's what makes her great. Buy this CD!"
2,Please give us new material!,"Although this is an accurate reflection of her oeuvre, she should continue to write new material. The live versions are interesting, but she is much more polished in the studio."
1,Total crap,"It's ""live"" and the worst mix job I've ever heard. I've never heard a bootleg this bad. On most of the songs you can hardly hear her, it sounds like she is singing in a different room than the one the instruments are in. The songs you can hear her on, she sounds like she is singing in a phone booth. My question is ""How do you put a - (minus) in front of the 1 star rating minimum rating?"" Definately do not buy this CD, and if you've just eaten don't even listen to it. I love all her other CD's but I won't even make my dog listen to this."
2,Why is she doing this now? Is she going to retire?,"If she has new material, that's what the fans want. There are too many artists out there who rest on their laurels. She certainly has been a media darling since day one. Does this mean this is the end?"
4,Compelling in a tragic and real sense.,"I had read four of Craig's fictional books, before reading his biography, so was familiar with his real-life characters.Like one of the reviews, I was ""compelled"" to finish this poignant and gut-wrenching story; bringing the book along on a Mexican cruise and visits to the doctor.The one issue I have with this book comes I guess from being a retired Episcopal Priest. I was bothered by Craig's seeming lack of motivation to forgive his father. It seemed at times like he couldn't live without resentment. In the end, though, it's not mine to judge.I know Craig, having taken a three week, five day a week summer course under her excellent tutelege. I must say he is a wonderful, gentle and loving man, in spite of all he has been through.Perhaps he has forgiven his father more than he yet realizes!"
3,beautiful song played during hailstorm?,"i'm desperately looking for the name of the song played during the hailstorm scene (which is just after they got off the train). it begins when we see rain drops start falling, and sandra and ben walk over the tyres, it keeps on playing until the scene switches to the party at Savannah (where the music changes to 'Remember Me'). it's got this really soothing female voice wooing through and soft beats... please help!"
1,Techno: The Downward Spiral.,I believe I speak for many other connoisseurs of truly excellent musical compilations when I say that the soundtrack for Forces of Nature completely sucked. BIG TIME. It is possibly the most horrendously compiled list of sucky songs in soundtrack history. Perhaps the ONLY appropriate thing about it is that it perfectly mirrored the movie in its complete rancidness. Let me reitterate: It STINKS.
4,HELP!,"After listening to the album I noticed that the song I wanted was not on there. IF SOMEONE COULD PLEASE HELP ME. I want to know the name of the song and/or artist who sings the last song before the credits in the movie. It's some girl. If you know the answer, Please, Please, Please email me at: k.e@bigfoot.com. Thanks. Other than that, an excellent cd!"
4,The last song before the credits is by. . . .,"It's by Sarah McLachlan and it's called Fear. She's a popular Canadian singer. This song can be found on one of her earlier albums ""Fumbling Towards Ecstacy"", which I suggest you get. It's a great album. I bought that album in my early teens before she became really popular, and Fear has been my favorite song since. I was pleased to hear her song on Forces of Nature. It was a big BIG mistake for the producers of the CD to have left out Fear from the final release of the soundtrack."
4,They left off the most important song,"I bought this CD for two songs, Fear by Sarah McGaughlin and Everlasting Love by U2. But, they left off Fear. The rest of the songs are good not great except for Love the one you're with!Still, over all, good music all around."
3,alright blend of different musical stylings...,"The only reason that I bought this cd was for U2's version of ""Everlasting Love"". It is the song that I enjoy the most on the whole cd. The Faithless songs are enjoyable as well , but I already had their albums - so these tracks were nothing new to me. The Touch & Go track ""Would You...?"" is a fun little booty shaker, and the Holly Palmer track is good as well - the rest of this is complete blecch."
5,where do you find the songs!!!???,I appreciate your help on finding song titles. However many of the songs such as the hailstorm and the balcony songs are insturmentals and are not on the cd. So i was wondering if anyone knew if they sold the insturmental parts on a separate cd like some movies do. IF not does anyone else know where to find the songs?
1,"Fair, at best","Some may appreciate the variety of musical styles found on this soundtrack, but I found the result to be a disjointed, formatless compilation."
2,Looking for 2 songs in the movie that isn`t on the sound....,"The songs I`m looking for a beeing played: 1) When Ben and Sandra drives over the bridge and Sandra meets her housband. 2) In the end, when Ben is looking up at the balcony and sees his bride ( the piano piece )."
4,What Song???,What is the name of the Piano Piece played toward the end of the movie when Ben looks at his Bride on the balcony....Just wondering! PLZ e-mail me @ ryan_161@hotmail.com Other than this: THE CD IS GREAT
4,Looking for a song,"Ok maybe it's me, but some of the coolest ""tunage"" can be found in the oddest places on movies. In this case, it's the snippit that's playing when you click on the special features option of the DVD. It's a nice beat, good music, and I have no idea how to research it. If anyone had heard this and knows what it is, please email me at gotalotaluv@aol.com. Thanks!"
4,HELP!,"i want to know the same as Chris.. The song before the credits , with the girl , sounds kinnda like Enya or something. If you can help me plz e-mail me at mattias_rage@geocities.com"
5,BeTtEr DaYs is the coolest!!,"i think that this song is the coolest!! How many song have you heard that are like this one?? I love this song when I am feelin down this song always makes me feel better. i love that part in it when it says ""you like my gucci bag?"" ""its beautiful beautiful"" Its so funny!! This is definitly the cd to get!!"
3,case handle should be more comfortable,"It is a heavy case, supposed to hold a heavy Les Paul - the handle hurts your hand after a few minutes."
1,Wrong case,I was sent a banjo case and not a Les Paul guitar case. I returned the case thru UPS. I have not recieved my refunded monies yet. Delivery time was very good and return handled very prompt and courteous by all who assisted
5,Great Les Paul Case,"This Case fits my Epiphone Les Paul perfectly. You can put a righty or a lefty Les Paul in it. Its nice that you can lock it. It's got tons of padding in it. There is a small storage area in it, I can fit a Boss pedal, a tuner a strap and picks in it. Over all a great case."
5,Excellent. Best value out there!,"There are other cases out there that cost more than the genuine Epiphone case. I don't think you can find a better case however, regardless of cost. The quality of this case is fantastic. I have a Lim. Ed. Les Paul Custom Pro and this case fit it like a glove! If you have an Epiphone Les Paul, do yourself a favor and get a genuine Epiphone case."
4,problem with lock,"Prompt delivery, no complaints there.Good case, the guitar is a tight fit inside. Lock is flimsy as one would expect, unfortunately doesn't work either."
4,Case for Epiphone Les Paul,"I like this case. Would have been nice to be able to choose the interior color, but the grey is nice. Also the storage lid doesn't stop in the stopping block, doesn't seem broken, just goes past it all the way to the bottom of the case if you push it that far. the interior material holds it in place so not too concerned."
3,OK for the money. Sounds good. Quality is average.,"Price point is probably fair.It is made out of hardwood and wrapped with a shiny mylar, like a drum, and the hole is wrapped with a gold colored metal which feels pretty good on the middle finger. There is no hand grip or indent for the hand. It is a basic tambourine with a ""fiberskin"" head. I like the sound of the head. More drum like than other tambourines I've used.It does not meet professional quality standards. The head is glued on and has a ribbon over it with 2 staples to fasten the ends. The jingles are on the ""tinny side."" Over all, I would give it a C for quality and a B for sound but I will keep it in the mix for now."
4,Quality upbeat royality free music!,"I produce videos for work, and I have already used nearly all the songs in this package. I like how there are 15, 30, 60 and full lengths of each track. They are not just cut to that length, but composed to that length so you have a proper intro & wrapup! Only wish there were more songs. A great collection!"
5,Cultural differences,"This is a wonderful book to share with children. Children need to know that different cultures do things differently. Culture is a big part of people and how they live their lives. This book was awarded a Caldecott Honor in 1987 for the wonderful pastel pictures. I, myself, loved this book and so did my children in the classroom."
5,Great Book,"This is a great book about a real village in Cameroon Africa. As a teacher, I actually use this book to teach surface area and volume. After reading the book, we determine the surface area and volume of the two houses and then compare them. It provides a great real-life application of a ""boring"" Geometry concept."
3,I brought it used.,I brought it used. Had some problems with skipping on some games. Will not buy any more used DVD's or games.
2,The book was in fair condition.,"Bernard Jensen is one of my favorite authors. But I was disappointed about the all side notes in pen and pencil through 1/3 of the pages. The book was not in good condition as it was described by the seller-only fair. The reason I didn't want it high-lighted because I do it myself for my needs and record the knowledge. Overall, it's OK, I love the book. Thank You!The book's title: Dr.Jensen's NUTRITION HANDBOOK The Daily Regimen for Healthy Living"
2,Consider Another Book,"This books has some good information, but it seems to be poorly edited. It's somewhat redundant, and there are blatant grammar errors and even an obvious math error (""1,300 + 130 = 1,630""). These flaws take away from the points the author tries to make. I'd also like a little more information about some of the researchers and studies she cites. There are resources in the back of the book, but no footnotes to help you identify which sources support which statements."
5,excellent,"I work in this field and so was really pleased to discover a straight forward but detailed account of this very serious problem. This book describes the problems but also offers help. I recommend this book, it is excellent."
2,Run rabbit run,"The author gives the invaluable advice to prospective adoptive parents fully to educate themselves before trying to adopt, including selecting the right attorney. Well he is an attorney and he wants people to read, read, read--not the books which the people want to select but those listed at the back of Mr. Hicks' book, complete with order form. And wouldn't you know that these books are published by his own publisher? Run rabbit run.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
2,I wonder if Walt Disney read this?,"This book - written by the author of Bambi, no less - is about as non-Politically Correct as can be imagined. It outlines in detail the sexual exploits of a young German girl living in somewhat dire means from about the age of seven until fifteen, and how she uses her sexuality - again, in detail - to raise her status in life.It is unapologetic in tone but so far from what could be considered mainstream by today's standards that I cannot really recommend."
5,Great Rock CD,I have all of the Papa Roach CDs and this one is by far my favorite. Several popular songs along with many songs that will get stuck in your head over and over.
1,Emo sucks and so does this album,"This album sounds too ""emo"" and yet like all my other favorite bands they seem to divert from there original style and change to the music industries terms which is ""emo punk"" sounding whining crying emotional music such bands as AFI, My Chemical Romance, Anti-Flag, Saves the Day. I miss their old hardcore in your face style such as ""Last Resort"" and ""Broken Home"". Now they have an album with all the same sounding stuff. I loved Papa Roach up to this album. I've bought every single album and I admit I didn't buy this album because it wasn't worth my 13$."
4,"Great album, but product description is misleading","As I started off with, this is a great album. It has rocking riffs with a softer underfeel, which layers the songs so that they rock, but you can mellow out with them as well.My only issue with this product is that, while Amazon doesn't list it anywhere, I received the edited, or clean, version of the album via this product page. While this may be good for some people, when ""heroine"" gets edited out because it sounds similar to ""heroin"", I have issue with it. There are multiple versions of this album: regular, edited, with and without the bonus materials. If you want other than the clean with bonus materials version, you'll need to go elsewhere."
3,Doesn't Really Stand Out,"If I had to recommend another Papa Roach album over this one, it would be... Any of the others.That's not to say that it's a bad album, really. You won't want to burn it or anything, but it just seemed very popish, I guess. The songwriting seemed very repetitive and just generally boring. The music was nothing to get excited about. It was just a general rock album that didn't stick out in any way, shape, or form.I will say I enjoyed ""No More Secrets"", ""What Do You Do?"", ""Time Is Running Out"", and ""...To Be Loved"", but I wouldn't call any of them a favourite or even exceptional tracks.""Roses on My Grave"" was an interesting sounding track and could've been great, but it was just too repetitive."
4,One of my favorite CD'S,"Papa Roach has done so much music over the years. Some have said they just putting out too much material I tend to disagree, ifa person has something he or she needs to say then get it out there. I am a huge Papa Roach fan and this album to me is one of there best they have made up to this point. Two of my favorite songs off this album were My heart is a Fist, and Roses on my Grave.The whole album spoke to me threw the songs and lryics, so if you can stay open minded and listen to the whole CD start to finish and hear the lryics he is saying in the song then I am sure you will feel something just like I did as I listen to the album start to finish. Just an all around amazing rock album that has to be listen to over and over again."
3,Moving on.,"Thank God he doesn't rap anymore.But in the end, Papa Roach is what they are, and you shouldn't expect them to be something else. After four major label releases, if you don't like them by now you probably won't. I am surprised that people still write bad reviews for this band. Aside from a great live show they have never been spectacular. But they are fun, energetic, and a good listen if you can put aside your expectations. The Paramour Sessions continues on this path with a little exploration on the musical side. Lyrically you will struggle to find anything new in this album. It's almost impressive enough that they are still around when most of their peers have disbanded or disappeared. But if you liked Papa Roach before, there is no reason you shouldn't now. Most importantly, go catch their tour."
3,Nothing too special,"When I first heard ""To Be Loved"" I thought that this would be an awesome, in your face, entergetic album. The first 3 songs were awesome and energetic. But then tracks 4 and 5 came on and they were way slower. Track 6 sped it up again and it is a sweet song. Then it slows down for pretty much the last half of the cd. I think this cd is okay to kinda good. It just doesnt have the energy like their other cds."
2,they only fell apart..,"Well there they slip again. It seems they're trying to cater to mainstream fans with this release. Only the first two tracks are worthy of the 2 stars. I guess the days of Last Resort, Broken Home and Blood Brothers are gone. Now it's just the same old pop punk garbage. Oh well, Papa Roach, jusr another 90's band that has come and gone."
2,Not a Big Fan,"So,I was fired up about this album. Hearing it was going to be a harder album. Well I was disappointed. First few tracks are good, then it gets really slow and the last song, is horrible. Definitely nothing special about this album. Their live show is awesome, that would be the only reason I am still interested in them. Next album, I'll wait until after a few weeks to see how it went over.Tryfinding a used copy or burn it from a friend, don't pay full price.If you want good rock n roll, Try Buckcherry or Black Stone Cherry."
2,Worst. Papa Roach. Ever,"This album only rates two stars because I've seen them in concert and they really put on a good show, so I can't completely dis them. However, this album is completely forgettable. If you were a big fan of ""Infest"" I would not recommend it. If you liked their second and third album and are a ""Scars"" junkie then this is probably right up your alley (in fact, fitting that there is a live ""Scars"" track on the end of the album). To top it off, there is mindless drivel for lyrics. Having said that, I'd still definitely see them in concert again; they put on a great show and their singer is completely electric. Borrow the album from a friend before you buy is all I'm saying. I wonder if these guys pushed this out to satisfy a contract obligation or something...."
1,horrible,"what happened to the roach? Probably the worst album i have ever listened to, straight little girl pop rock. Trust me I was a huge roach fan until i heard this excuse for music. I am left asking myself Jacoby what were you thinking?"
4,Not their best but still good,"Papa roach has been changing since day one. The first album was great. The second was better(till this day my fav. p.roach cd). The thrid was also good. Now the new one, yes it does have some songs that sound like they are lefover from gawm(3rd album). But it also has new things they havent dont before. This is there softest album. But i still liked it ive been a fan since day one. Cant wait for the next one. It does seem to me since they went to geffen they changed the way they write songs. In getting away with murder and this one it seems that they dont write to much lyrics so they repeat the chorus to much. Thats my only negative thing to say about p. roach."
3,2nd best record,"I think it contains to much slow songs , I like the first 4 energized songs but the rest of them I get tired of listening to them for a while."
5,Pick this one up!,If you like Papa Roach and have their last albums and enjoy them then you should pick their new one up. You will be happy that you did. Great songs on this one. 5 Stars!
3,"Good release, but not on par with earlier stuff","I would say this is their third best cd. Getting Away With Murder, Infest, Paramour Sessions, and Lovehatetragedy: in that order. I've never been a huge fan of them, but they are an above average hard rock band that writes some catchy tunes. For me, it has always been hit or miss with their songs. On this one, it is about 50/50 on hits and misses. Still, if half the songs are good, that is reason enough for me to buy a cd. And maybe the others will grow on me. For those of you who liked Infest and maybe haven't checked these guys out for awhile, they aren't exactly the same band. They have lost that rap-rock vibe they had, and adopted a cleaner hard rock approach, as have many other bands of the nu-metal era. Hit songs: ""to be loved"" and ""Forever"" are included on this cd.3.5 stars."
5,best album I've purchase in 2006,"This album is AWESOME....This is one of the few cd's where I can listen to every track on the album...I love every song on the album....If you don't have this album, you must get it.....If you don't like ROCK, you will, after listening to this album....This is a must have.....TWO THUMBS UP..."
1,THIS IS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!,"Well I am really dissapointed with this whole cd. The first song was about basketball, so I was like ok the rest better be good. Then the second one is about basketball. Then I checked the back and all the songs are about basketball! I am with the fan from Gainesville,FL it is a disgrace to No Limit and Master P. Plus this cd has no cuss words which isn't a big deal but Master P has been going from hard core to soft core, he needs some help! I still got love for NO Limit though!"
2,couldv'e been a lot better,"No limit has really gone down in quality ever since all these new people have started joinin with the real soldiers. The only good songs are Aint my fault and woof, and they just took those of made man and the game is to be sold not to be told. I laughed out loud when i looked in the cover and saw an ad for master p shoes, and his talking doll. Its ok if u like repetitive music."
1,was looking for some music for highschool team- hate this.,This is not what I was looking for. Not too good if I say so
1,Totally lame,"I was hyped about this cd bigtime, but when I heard it I was really let down. There is one good song by Fiend, and other than that, the album is awful."
2,IT WASANT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE,MASTER P NEDDS TO COME WITH SOME NEW RHYMES BECAUSETHE ARE SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER IN THE CD. P AINT THE ONLY ONE DOING IT SILLK IS DOING IT P'S FAVORITE THING YOU HEAR IS THAT GHETTING ROUDY ROUDY AND BOUTIT BOUTIT
1,I WANTED TO GIVE 0 (ZERO) STARS!,"first of all, i am not a player hater! i am a HUGE No Limit Fan, & love all the soldiers, but this? this is pathetic! reason #1- the song ""B-Ball"" is on the album FOUR times!!!!! reason #2- two songs are taken from old No Limit records. reason #3-all the other songs suck anyway! BUT.. I will say the only songs that are actually good is the song by FIEND, and the song by MAGIC. but 2 good songs does not make an album!"
2,"It was a birthday present, I should've bought another NL cd","First of all, they should've never been dedicate the whole cd to B-ball, that's just imposible. So, yeah I was disappointed when I listened this Cd the first time. And I would never buy such a cd, but as I said, it was a present.. so I can't tell my friends how worse this cd is. No Limit is going down maybe, but I still love solo cd's of Master P, Silkk the Shocker... And we all know: 2pac was the best"
3,where ya'll at,"Man where has NO LIMIT been these days. They are going to lose all of there fans to Cash Money if they keep coming out with stupid stuff like this. I wasn't that hyped about it because I knew it was all about basketball. But the only good track on there is Magic's, but besides all the rest they are bunk"
2,"Alright, what is going on with No Limit these days?","Why did they dedicate a whole cd to basketball? Besides, MP got cut from the Fort Wayne Fury and later the Charlotte Hornets. Some of the beats are pretty good, but after a while the lyrics become unbearable. I hope TRU will be good, but i dont think, from what they've put out this year, will be that great."
1,What a friggin' shame...,"...that the fat cats get away with selling this crap to the American people. Rap su**s nowadays. I listen to the rap of ten years ago (including: NWA, Public Emeny, Beastie Boys), then listen to today's rap. And wonder: ""What is THIS?"" If you think about it, rap is just speaking to boring music. No I really mean, think about that for a second, then we'll continue this review.........okay. Now, lets discuss ten years ago. 1989. Some rap was so-so. Like NWA...the first two tracks. Public Enemy....we can't be stopped. Beastie Boys.....the whole album boyeee! Now, theres (ugh) this ""music"". I agree with bolsy32@aol.com (review for Pauls Boutique): Rap (most of it) is talentless noise. And shizzam: maybe I don't know jack about rap, but I DO know jack about good music, and this ain't it. People: Don't waste your green. Enough said. Peace out."
3,"Bought for a class, keep for reference","I bought this a few years ago for a copyright class I took in college. I keep it around for reference so I know my rights and what I should do to copyright and trademark my intellectual property. I'm sure some of the information is out of date by now, but I guess that's what the internet is for."
5,Wake Up Call...,"Deep discussion and insight into celibacy, sex, men, women and self-discovery. Terri has done an excellent job presenting her case on how men and women view sexual relationships and celibacy. I commend her for sharing personal life experiences to drive the message home. The issues covered are very serious, but the author was able to spice it up with words of wisdom, a little humor and some old fashioned cliches. This book is a must read for teens and adults still in search of that something missing from their lives."
5,"FANTASTIC BOOK, ENOYED IT VERY MUCH.","I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN UNTIL THE LAST PAGE WAS FINISHED. THE AUTHOR HAS A LOT TO SAY ABOUT CELIBACY AND HOW IT BENEFIT WOMEN. IT GAVE ME A NEW RESPECT FOR WOMEN WHO RETAIN A HIGH VALUE FOR THEIR BODY.I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE OF INTEREST TO BOTH MALES AND FEMALES. ALL TEENS AND PARENTS OF TEENS WILL FIND THIS TO BE A MUST READ.MATURE WOMEN WHO PRETEND A LOT ABOUT THEIR SEXUAL HABITS WILL FIND THIS BOOK TO HAVE THEM IN MIND IN NOT BEING ASHAME TO ADMIT HAVING NO MAN OR SEX.SIGNED-JEWEL E. DEARMAN, YOU GO TERRI; A MALE READER."
2,disappointing,"bought 2 pairs for both my kids. They look good and are nice and soft, but the description said they're snow-hardy and they're not! they got very wet. Will now have to look for a real water-proof pair"
3,"Great price, received an Excel-G made in Taiwan, not Japan","Amazon offers this shock at a lower price than just about anyone, but I specifically ordered the ""GR2"" in silver color because they're supposed to be made in Japan, and very high quality. The product I received was a black Excel-G made in Taiwan. The Taiwan shock will likely work fine, but it is not nearly as desireable as the Japan-made shock that is listed in the title and pictured. A bit misleading."
4,A great period movie with love and blood.,"This is one of my favorite sleepers. Not only is it a great Victorian period movie, it is also a crime thriller. For the more romantic at heart it includes two love stories; one unfulfilled and the other with broken trust. Worthy of at least a few viewings. Also, Anwar is great as an English rag doll with looks and brains. Buy it."
2,Not satisfied,"I found this tape to not be very challenging at all. Linda Arkin might be a good teacher, and very concerned with proper technique, but the pacing is much too slow. She also talks throughout the entire tape, and spends the first 15 minutes of a 45-minute tape on chatty introductions to the sequences. That leaves 1/2 hour to practice 3 or 4 moves. If you're looking to build on previous yoga knowledge, then this tape is not for you."
1,Revolting and amateurish,"The ""rave"" reviews by readers here must have been written by the authors themselves and/or their friends, because this is a very sorry excuse for a cookbook! Amateurish, poorly written, and worst of all-- many of the recipes were absolutely revolting! There are much much better cookbooks out there. Stay clear of this one."
3,just ok,"not a bad book, but a little more info than i was looking for. recipes are really for ""blending"" and not necessarily just for those using a ""juicer,"" and especially if you are just starting out. if you just want the basics, try The Juiceman's Power of Juicing. it is really good!"
3,It's OK.,"I found some good things in this book, and some that I've read in a number of other books. It's more of a reference book for me. It's not one that I would go out and buy again, but it's ok."
5,this is the way,juicing and eating raw is the solution to many health issues you can do it start today eat raw fruit begin the transition!!
5,Good addition to the kitchen,I couldn't ask for more in such a commonplace tool. It is pleasant to handle and use and has just the right amount of flexibility.
4,Norpro Nylon Spatula,"Good product for the money, I purchased 2 of them. They are a little flimsy,but they do a good job for what I purchased them for. If you are in the market for a basic fry pan tool, then the (Norpro 906 Nylon Nonstick 13 inch Slotted Spatula) will do the job for you. Shipping was timely and I am satisfied with my purchase."
2,Dog not very interested,"Although the dog likes to chew rawhide, she doesn't like these. She chewed on one end a little and then abandoned them."
5,Cute and Comfy!,"I love this bra - at a D cup, not that many decent-looking bras actually feel good, and this one does."
2,bra,"This bra was not particularly good for a full figured woman, more like a push up bra than we need! I wanted a different Vanity Fair Sophia Comfort Bra, but the difference between them are not particularly spelled out well on the webpage."
4,Absorbing and touching pop-infused love story,"The Belle and Sebastian song of the same name seems to have provided the basic structure of this story of the convergence and romance of two damaged but likeable protagonists. The characters' extensive backstories are to some extent schematic (certain patterns from the past reassert themselves rather too obviously in the present), but the novel is enjoyable and absorbing, pop-literate without being obnoxious, and funny enough, with a voice that is always decent and humane."
5,"Life is Hard - but keep it up, it might get better","My only complaint is that I wish the book were longer. I read it in two nights and didn't want it to be over. Halpin's characters are likeable and understandable. The book is incredibly readable. And he conveys the message that despite how hard life is, if you keep going day by day, trying to do better -- you just might!"
5,My daughter loves this.,"I bought this pony for my four year old. She loves that the pony has the same ""birthday"" that she does. It is one of her favorite ponies now."
2,WIsh I'd recieved a fresher product....,recieved very close to cans' expiry date so their was no strong taste. I have othercurry types and I have high hopes for those.
1,White Dawg should hang himself with Master P's intestins,"White Dawg comes out of no where and acts like he can rap. You can't even compare him to shady, he couldn't even be shady's back up dancer. He should buy a gun put it in his mouth and pull the trigger numorous times. Please don't buy this if you do you are a country bumpkin."
1,Negative 2 stars..,"Now I'm all for white I rappers I like my boy Eminem and My boy Haystack from Nashville. Haystack is REALL ""Dirty south"" crunk rap. ""WHITE DAWG!!"" come on that is so NON-creative and generic. With a name like that I would never give him a record deal. I can not take him seriously. Now I love stuff like pastor troy, ludacris, but this ""white dawg"" garbage should be burried and never dug up. Sorry white dawg, nice try but switch up your name along with your voice...."
2,"nice production, wack mc",Some of the tracks are well produced and would have been good save for White Dawg himself. The only tracks I could listen to all the way through were 'hit his ass' and 'for my players...' The third verse of 'hit' was nice (I don't think it was White Dawg tho) and the chorus is tight. The production on 'players' is so nice that not even White Dawg's vocals could ruin it. If you can tolerate a really annoying and obviously fake emcee and you like your music dirty then maybe this is for you. I give it four stars for the nice production and minus two stars for White Dawg on the mic.
4,THE DAWG WAS FRESH,THIS CD IS PRETTY GOOD MOST OF THE BEATS WERE HITTING NOT ALL OF THEM #19 WAS GOOD AND THE REST WAS ALRIGHT. ITS A GOOD JEEP CD.
3,"He's not as good as Eminem, but then most aren't.","Just because he is white, people want to compare him to top rapacts, if you do, then he is nowhere in that category, but he is better than alot of other rappers I've heard, black and white. This cd has above average beats for an independent label, plus I believe this is his first album, so give him a break. I bought it just to support him, because I know it is very hard to break into the rap biz if you're white, skills or not! I'm Out!"
2,didn't meet my expectations,"I purchased this to replace an aging panasonic battery. It doesn't seem to hold the charge very well. I use the panasonic battery for several hours and it gives me a warning that the battery is running low. The energizer just dies. It shows full and then click, you loose a connection and then you put it on the charger and check again and it shows only one bar. Anyway, I bought two and have put the original panasonic battery back in and am much happier."
5,Great Price,"I have 4 phones, 2 started to exhibit problems, replacement batteries made all the difference. Purchased 4 batteries for the same price as one at Future Shop. I'm a very happy customer"
5,Finally a Health Book that really HELPED!,"This book is an excellent read. It is very informative. I enjoyed the book even more because it was simple to read. The techniques given are easy to understand and follow.The section on detoxing was clear cut. It also gives different ways of detoxing your body. The book is filled with different methods of getting and keeping our bodies healthy. It is great to have such an informative book written for African Americans. Basically I have enjoyed the book so much,that I am now buying one for a friend. This is a book that I would definitely tell friends to buy."
5,Great Book for All Mothers!,"I wish I had found a book like this when my kids were young, I know I would have had the courage to run to the doctor less often and relied more on my medicine chest. My daughter has been very worried about giving her children so many antibiotics, every time they have an earache or a sore throat, it seems to be more drugs. At last here is someone here who talks sense, and gives us advice on how to treat every day ailments without resorting to strong drugs and possible side effects. Kathy Duerr believes in foot baths, and massaging feet with oils and herbs, and gives advice on what to keep in your medicine cupboard. My daughter, who has three little ones, is over the moon about this book, and can't recommend it highly enough to all parents of young children."
4,"Radio play, best for Beckett enthusiasts","This is a very well-done recording of a ""late Beckett"" radio play, and is well worth hearing for Beckett fans. ""Music"" is only one of several parts, so there isn't a lot of it, and total timing is less than 42 minutes. Thus, Feldman aficionados interested in the Feldman-Beckett collaboration might be better served by the quasi-opera ""Neither"", on Hat Art Records."
5,Great for smoothies!,"I was looking for a blender powerful enough to make my morning frozen fruit and yogurt smoothie in under a minute - this blender does it in under 20 seconds! I like the two speeds (who actually uses all 12 of the speeds offered by other blenders?!?), with the pulse being a somewhat slower and more ""grinding"" blend and the sustained speed being a high powered ""whip it up"" blend. Overall, very very pleased with this product. And the brushed chrome looks so good, I can leave it on the counter!"
2,Buyer beware. This has design problems.,"I have tried several blenders primarily for smoothies. This blender is powerful at 500 watts and it will literally move on the counter due to the vibration while blending. It is fairly loud but it is a blender. It makes great smoothies as long as fruit is cut in pieces and enough milk or soymilk is used for a smooth consistancy. However, this blender uses a fuse that I assume protects the motor. The fuse cannot be replaced by the consumer. I cut out the fuse after it burned out and connected the wires to the motor. The blender worked great for a while until the motor coupling broke. Oster promotes this blender as all metal drive. A motor coupling connects the motor shaft to the blades. This coupling is a thin threaded metal rod enclosed in rubber. Mine broke and now I need to replace it. I won't buy another Oster again."
2,"Too heavy, too powerful!","I think that Tim ""the tool man"" Taylor, designed this blender. There is a very high pulse speed and an even higher set speed (the only 2 speeds). This creates an air pocket around the bottom so, you have to pick up the blender and shake it every 10 seconds. This is the only way to get what you're blending to fall back to the bottom.Also the lid broke in the first month when the center feel into my shake. The blades are strong! They broke the plastic lid in seconds.The container part is a heavy thick glass which is good or bad depending on what you want.It is also very loud! Wear ear plugs.It does look nice sitting on the counter, but I would recomend something else if you plan on using your blender."
4,Great smoothie blender!,We make smoothies every morning and this blender easily chomps through ice and frozen fruit to make a perfectly textured smoothie. Also works well for soups and pesto. Very powerful and very cool looking. We lost the filler cap in a soup misadventure and I've found that replacement parts are very easy to find and not too expensive.
4,"Very, Very Good...but not perfect","Bought to make morning smoothies. Chops quickly, easy to clean, elegantly simple & attractive, the blender seems to be of very good quality.Negative points are the LOUDNESS of this thing. Sounds like a rock-crusher in action. Also has some issues with blending too much fruit and ice at once. Be reasonable in adding things to blend, and you'll be fine.Overall, a very good product."
1,Oster Beehive Blender,"What a disappointment. I read a lot of good reviews about this blender, good enough that I was willing to overlook the one flaw mentioned, its very high noise level. That was not an exaggeration, but what really disappointed me was the cheap material used to make the blender, namely plastic instead of metal."
5,nice & inexpensive,"I bought this for a friend; she was really pleased. It's great to have such a nice variety of inexpensive silver jewelery available. I know it would be untraditional, but it is difficult to get a feel for how jewelery would look ""in real life"" from the standard jewelery-seller photos. Hopefully I can get an action shot and submit it as a user picture."
5,Beautiful birthday gift,"I bought this for my sister - as it had both of her birthstones for November - Citrine & Topaz (depending on what lists you look at). She was touched by my thoughtfulness, and I was glad the price didn't put me out, although it looks like it did. ;) Very nice."
4,Good overall,I bought several copies of this book to give out as gifts at a recent family reunion. There were some good ideas in the book. I particularly liked the ideas of how to display a family tree in different wasy besides always a tree shape.
3,book,Overall I'm not a fan of the book however amazon did a great job mailing it to me on time. One major problem that I am having is that some of the pages are missing in the book!
3,kagan and segal's book,not to happy with the book had a lot of writting in it. but the delivery was quick
1,Haterid,"Don't like it ,it was the world worst thing that I have ever read but it was not the first time"
3,Not bad,"When this arrived it was broken, the exchange was easy and the second one is in perfect condition. It looks good, it is not very strong, but should be fine for a light suitcase."
3,"Looks nice, but..","I purchased 3 racks and they look great. However, one had broken at the seam of the bottom dowel. I had to reglue it, and I sure hope it holds. For the price I paid, I thought they should be better quality."
4,Winsome Wood Luggage Rack,Product arrived in good condition and was as advertised. We get lots of overnight guests and this helps our guests keep their luggage handy. Rack was nicely finished so it looks good in our guest bedroom.
4,A better price,These are a good value for the price and if you have a Bed bath and beyond nearby you can get them for $25 and they often have 20% off coupons in addition.
1,Packaged horribly,"This product came broken because it was mailed without any cushion whatsoever. I am now having to send it back, which is a huge incovenience because the box was in such damaged shape and there were no easy return slips."
4,Perfect for guest room,"The quality is great for the price. We needed something for a small guest room that didn't have room for a table or bench. Too soon to know if it will really be used, though."
4,Good product,"Not the most expensively made product, but well worth the affordable price on it. Very functional. Use two in our guest room so that people can pack and unpack as much as they want. Handy for other purposes too, like a low table (just place appropriate size piece of plywood on it). Glad we got them."
5,What's getting in the way,"This is absolutely to guide to finding what your strengths are and the things that are standing in the way, or distracting you, from developing and focusing on those strength areas.What are you tolerating? What served you before and no longer serves you?Go through the guide and take action to leverage your personal best!Well written, practical exercises."
5,"Brilliant man, brilliant comedy","I don't know if anything has ever made me laugh so hard. He is a genius in the great tradition of Lenny Bruce. Weirdly, he's also in the tradition of George Carlin, who doesn't yell at all. Explain that one.I buy this in bulk and give it to my friends."
4,Another from the Comical Mind of Lewis Black,"This is an excellent CD, the only issue I have with it is that most of the material here can be heard and seen on his DVD Black on Broadway. It's always better to actually watch a comic because then you can see the expressions on their faces, and that actually adds to joke just enough to make it funnier. My favorite part has to be where he rants on about Enron where he comes up with a law should exist. ""If you have a company, and it can't explain in one sentence what it does, it's illegal."" There are a few parts not found on the DVD, but overall you are better just sticking with the DVD. Pick this up if you are really big Lewis Black fan, otherwise just get the DVD."
4,Good Album,"I am a fan of Lewis Black. Even though I don't agree with his politics and all the comments he makes, he is an excellent comedian and this is a great album."
4,Lewis Black does not disappoint.,This man is a very funny topical comedian known for his ranting. Though this is not his best work I am glad I have it.
4,Pretty damn funny,"This CD is funny. Maybe not as funny as I thought that it would be after reading all of the reviews on this site. If you want to laugh very hard I would go with Dave Attell, Dane Cook, or Larry the Cable Guy."
3,OK album but not as good as the others,"If you're a fan of Lewis Black and you enjoyed the White Album and End of the Universe, you may be slightly disappointed with this CD. While it is funny, it doesn't seem to have as much punch as his previous CDs. If you're considering making this your first Lewis Black CD, get the White Album or End of the Universe instead."
1,Not that funny and way too much profanity,"Let me start by saying this: I am a fan of Lewis Black. I enjoy his Daily Show appearances and I also like his ""Comedy Central Presents"" specials. That said, I couldn't stand this CD. Nothing is that funny. Also don't get me wrong I'm not offended by profanity, but when every fourth word is a curse it gets mind-numbing. Take a pass on this and get his ""Unleased"" DVD instead."
3,Disappointing,"After enjoying Lewis Black a couple of times on the very funny Daily Show, I decided to pick up this CD for a recent road trip. I must say I was pretty disappointed. It seems that Black's idea of comedy is shouting things angrily with every other word being the same four letter favorite. I am not offended in the least by swearing (I love David Cross' comedy), so that is not the issue at all. I just didn't think this CD was funny, though there were a few good non-funny points made later in the album. I really really wanted to laugh and was let down with this CD.On a side note, I hope Black never plays Fairbanks because the whole show would be devoted to how cold it is here-yes, it's f***ing cold, get over it!"
2,Lewis gets worse and worse...,"Black's first CD, ""The White Album"" (is it a law that people with the last name of Black or White have to name their album that?) was a comedic stroke of genius, but with each album, he gets worse. At the best, Rules of Enragement elicited a couple of chuckles from me, but not the gut laughs that ""The White Album"" and half of ""The End of the Universe"" did. Stick with those two CD's and his Daily Show appearances."
2,I can justify two Starbucks next 2 each other more than this,"Lewis Black needs to write better material, and somewhat reinvent himself. I like it when he gets really angry, but only when it makes sense for him to do so. He is trying to fake his way being angry through this whole cd, when it was mostly trivial matters he was talking about."
1,THE FIRST RELEASE OF THIS FIGURE WAS BETTER...,"This is another repackaged Spiderman Classic figure that ToyBiz decided to put out with different hands and different accessories and called it ""new"". They seem to do that a lot. Instead of coming out with additional villains or other Spiderman characters, they give us this garbage. This sculpt was done first on the Punching Peter Parker with Burglar Trapping Actions figure. A better figure than this one. This figure has the same articulation as the Punching Peter Parker and the joints stay pretty tight. The accessory is OK, but doesn't sell the item. Save your money--pass on this one and get the Punching Peter Parker figure instead. You'll be glad you did."
3,shipping?,This toy is what I expected... What I DID NOT expect is that the shipping would cost 3 dollars more than the price of the toy! I was NOT happy about that...
5,Just what you'll need,"The 10-tool set is great! It's sturdy as all heck and good for adjusting almost any aspect of your bike on the fly.It's actually more useful for the allen wrench applications than the 17-tool version - because there are fewer tools, they take more space. This makes them longer, sturdier, and easier to handle. I've used both and prefer the 10-tool for simple adjustments."
3,big/heavy,good quality and function for the price but it is a small brick. It weighs 152 grams per my wife'e kitchen scale. That is a lot more than the advertised 124 grams. It is also large. Keep that in mind if looking at this for size/weight. My Topeak Toolbar does almost as much but is smaller and lighter.
4,Handy little tool for the road,Small tool that fits very well in the bike bag. It is a little on the heavy side but solid and well built. I had occasion to use it first ride to adjust the SPD clip tension. Should hold up very well and continue to be useful.
3,Minimalists Look Elsewhere,"I bought this to replace an Ascent Barebones Multitool that was stolen along with my road bike.When it arrived I was somewhat shocked at how big and heavy it was. It's at least twice as big as the Ascent and felt noticeably heavier as well. My kitchen scale reported 152g, which is substantially more than the advertised 124g and about 60% heavier than the 94g Ascent.Seems like a nice little tool otherwise."
2,Great price but the media is junk,Pros: The price is fairly good.Cons: 2 out of 50 worked. That's 48 coasters per spindle. NOT a good rate.Spend a little more and get some quality media; this is just junk.
1,NexxTECH DVD 16X - Junk - Junk - JUNK,I bought these DVD's at Circuit City and what a mistake. My Advice: Don't buy them!!!NDVD1650P NexxTech - 50 x DVD+R - 4.7 GB (120min) 16x - spindle - storage media
2,Cheap quality,The cord is too short to reach ordinary plug ins. We had a difficult time getting the bulb to screw in. The box arrived damaged - although not the product - and little white styrofoam pieces were everywhere.
1,"yeah, great, Mozart, but who's the white guy out front who can't shut up??","great. Mozart. ok? Wonderful, right?But this is like being at some huge concert like at Tanglewood soaking up the sounds and the wonder of it all, but some used car salesman on the next blanket WILL NOT SHUT UP AND LISTEN already.sure, love to listen to Mozart, and to share this treasure with children as background music and as focus music, but here we got this obnoxious voice from Orange County continually and constantly and unapologetically interrupting.yeah, maybe he's great in person dictating to little captive kids how to move by his own lights to Mozart, but dude, won't you please just for once SHUT UP ALREADY??at Tanglewood we would have thrown him in to the poison ivy patch behind the pines long since . . .so we all could finally hear, and listen, man woman and child, and be moved by Mozartnot by some know nothing clown from Orange County who moves us to anger and despair."
3,Chord Diagrams Don't Indicate Muted or Open Strings,"I got this book a short while ago and like the format. However, the first thing you need to do is memorize 26 chords. There are chord diagrams, but 25 out of 26 chord diagrams have non-fingered strings and there is no indication if a non-fingered string should be played open or if it should be muted. There are many more chord diagrams that follow with the same problem."
4,A million readers can't be wrong.,"Started the book but decided to study on line with Jimmy Bruno instead. The contents looks challenging. I will probably still work through it, though not at the pace suggested (one lesson a week - finish in one year). A great website by [...] has great support for this book."
1,"Poor novel, even poorer Kindle edition.","I have to agree with a previous reviewer about how predictable this novel is. However, most egregious is the fact that the Kindle edition for the Mac I purchased is only an unedited version -- a draft -- of the manuscript, with many, many typos and even question marks bordering names of places and streets, signaling where supposed editors needed to do further research. All in all, I felt cheated by Amazon, which knowingly or unknowingly sold me an unfinished product."
2,A Big Difference,"I have read all Victor Ostrovsky books. However, both ""deception"" books which were non-fiction (both books are about the time that Mr. Ostrovsky was with MOSSAD and after that) were quite different from Mr. Ostrovsky's last two novels, ""The Lion of Judah"" and ""Black Ghosts"". In my opinion, the theme of none of his novels were original. The story of ""Black Ghosts"" is very similar to several books written earlier on by others about the renegade elements with Russian military and intelligence who are opposed to any sort of democracy in Russia. Everything in this book is so predicatable that after reading the first few chapters the reader can easily predict and guess what will happen next."
4,A Realistic Glimpse into the World of Espionage!,"Knowing the author was an actual Case Officer for the Israeli Intelligence Agency makes this adventure more exciting and believable. There is an authenticity that cannot be contrived by Hollywood so to speak. I felt as though I were privy to the journels of Ostrovsky's real life experiences. I couldn't put it down until the exciting conclusion!! For all of you thrill seekers and spy lovers, this is a must read!"
4,Love the Lamp,We really enjoy this lamp. It has a floor switch that allows us to turn it on without hands. Its unique design makes it a fun addition to the room.I gave it 4 stars because of the minor problems that we had. One of the glass bulbs fell off (the glue came undone and it detached from the metal part). I contacted the customer service department and was told that I could purchase a new glass bulb. I was disappointed that they did not stand behind thier product.
3,"""The thick, viscous bile that his vital organs had become oozed forth.""","""Demonic Color"" gets off to a good start with numerous nasty gore-soaked murders, a quick pace and intriguing characters - I was burning through the pages! - but towards the end it seems as if Pauline Dunn (a.k.a. Dawn Dunn and Susan Hartzell) had written themselves into a corner and just opt for the lazy way out. A disappointing end to such a promising story.If you haven't already done it, I would pick up Dunn's ""Flesh Stealer"" instead."
4,Very cute,"This is a very cute book. Fun to read to your kids. It's not quite as good as ""Goldilocks has Chicken pox,"" but still very enjoyable."
1,Not Received,Can not give review since I have not received this item as of yet. Today's date 08/14/06
4,feels right in the hands,"I like almost everything about the C-3040. It is indeed, user friendly, very well thought-out.unlike the Nikon coolpix 995, which i also own. with the Olympus, i can make onboard computer changes quite fast.but.......with the type of photography i do, the camera fails.the problems that the C-3040 and other digital cameras have , that should come to an end quite soon, i hope, are; 1)slow computer speed after a shot has been taken.and 2)have to use a lower quality picture mode to stop action, under low light conditions. (like SQ1) you will get grain . what's the sense of having a 3 or 4 meg camera when you can only get that quality under ideal shooting conditions?"
4,"A great camera, but small annoyances....","Like many people have said, this camera has so many features, it's hard to figure out how to use all of them. I've had my 3040 for several months, and I haven't gotten around to trying out half the features. Overall, I have been pretty happy with it. While it does eat batteries, most digital cameras do, and it's easily solved by picking up some rechargables. My only complaint is I can *not* get the lens cap to stay on. It's not much of a problem if you always keep it in a camera case, but sometimes I throw it in my purse and inevitably, the lens cap will come off while I'm putting it in because it does not attach securely at all. A minor inconvenience mostly, but still happens often enough to become frustrating."
4,fantastic except for 128Mb smartmedia,"The camera is fantastic. Takes great indoor pictures with no red-eye problems. It takes great action shots with the 3 shots/second (at high resolution). Amazing!Just three weeks into it, my 128Mb smart media card stopped working, however. I cannot get the camera to use that card, even though my laptop can read/write/format it just fine with my pcmcia card adapter. So, I am disappointed with that, but thrilled with the camera in all other respects."
3,"Comes up, just shy of a camera","Pros:-Very fast 3.3 frames per second, size, weight, full use of manual settings up to 1.8f.Cons:-Viewfinder is not lined up with lens causing your shot to be off center and depending on the zoom, sometimes cuts off your subject (only important if you like to capture what you're seeing)-Not for beginners, must be prepared to tweak settings, does not have portrait, scenic, sport, etc., presets for speedy setup changes, -- Program, Aperture, Shutter, and Manual only.Fix the viewfinder/lens difference and you've got a great camera!"
5,Best for the bucks in 3 MegaPixels......,"I've owned this camera for 3 years and it's just great.I paid almost $1000 for the camera and several accessories. But well worth it at that time. Now you can get it for under $500 new or under $300 used (just the camera). I've already sold the camera to move to a digital SLR but I still recommend this camera to friends and family.I've printed 10x15'' photos with excellent quality, but I'm sure I can print even larger than that.Night photos are great and the automatic exposure feature with its 1.8 lens would make you look like a professional photographer at nightlight."
5,Fantastic Camera,"I had been using the Olympus D-460 Zoom the past six months and was very pleased by the quality and ease-of-use provided by the camera.It was time to upgrade, so I picked up the 3040 and was immeadiately impressed. The picture quality is absolutely stunning, and the huge array of options and features are great.If you're looking for a high-quality, reasonably priced 3 megapixel camera, this is the one."
5,Everything in this book tastes fantastic!,I gave this book as a gift to a friend who bakes. Best thing I ever did! The results have been delicious!
5,Fantastic Cook Book,"I originally bought Rosie's Cookie Book and was very impressed with the cookie recipes in it. All of them were wonderful. So I bought her baking book- this book is equally as fantastic. My copy is tattered and falling apart because I make the cakes in her book all the time. Her carrot cake, butter cake, and sour cream chocolate cake recipes are absolutely phenomenal.I have recommended both of these books to my foodie and dessert loving friends many times."
5,A Must Read For Any Gershwin Fan,"This is a must-read for any fan of Gershwin's music and anyone who wants to know more about the man. The items have been brilliantly selected. Some of my favorites: a description of Gershwin by his sister, a magazine article from 1939 by Oscar Levant in which the famous musician/wit gives a perceptive and anecdote-filled portrait of his friend, and a letter by Gershwin to his mother written just prior to his death. Probably most interesting of all are interviews conducted by Robert Wyatt with Todd Duncan (the first Porgy) and Anne Brown (the first Bess). In these interviews, the two singers, speaking from the vantage point of more than fifty years, talk with candor and affection about the George Gershwin they knew."
3,Adult beard,"The beard was bought for my son, who is 9, to wear for Halloween. I didn't see that it could only fit certain size faces. It was too big for him so he was bummed out. Just be aware you need to be older."
4,Simply incredible!,"I have visited India many times. But watching this gave me a re-appreciation of India's unique harmony in its diversity of language, culture, and customs. The film beautifully captures each aspect of India that makes her such a vibrant and resilient country. Not only was the cinematography breathtaking, but the music is really lovely.. I have always loved India. And, now, even more so after watching this film."
5,History of India,"Living in South Africa and in Natal where a lot of Indians reside I never knew India's rich Culture and History. I am 77 yrs of age and been many times to India,this dvd shown me what I did not know. With awe I looked at the video and must say this is a masterpiece in the trant of Verdi. A must have in anyones library. Now I appreciate my neighbours even more."
4,Surprisingly comfortable!,"When my husband bought us a set of these, I wasn't sure I would like a buckwheat pillow (he swears by them). After using the pillow for two nights, however, I was hooked! It fit very comfortably with the contours of my head and neck, and improved my sleep immensely. I've seen them cheaper at other merchants since these were bought, so that is why I rated them 4 instead of 5 stars."
5,Love it,"I live with chronic pain and what little sleep I am able to get would not be possible without my buckwheat pillow. I've probably tried 15 different types of pillows but this is the only type that allows me to get comfortable. My first one was purchased locally several years ago but when I needed to replace it, I couldn't find any in stores."
3,buckwheat lover,"i've had a buckwheat pillow of my own for probably 7 years now and i've always loved it. i got married over a year ago and have found my husband creeping over to my pillow in the night and commandeering it. so i decided to get him one for birthday. i have to say i was a little disappointed with this one...the seems to be bigger making it feel more like a bean bag than my beloved buckwheat pillow and the casing around it is pretty flimsy, not the sturdy canvas like material on my own. it's not a bad pillow, my husband enjoys it and doesn't steal mine anymore, but it's just not as quality. it was one of the cheaper pillows (i figured how different could they be?), but in this case i suppose you get what you pay for."
5,Toasty,"I'm wearing these now and I am Toasty... Gold Toe makes awesome socks... no question, so when I needed some knee socks to wear on ultra-cold days or when I wear boots, I wanted nothing less than the quality of a Gold Toe pair of socks. None of the stores in my area carried the Gold Toe knee socks so I ordered a few pair of these of Amazon. They were delivered last night and I'm wearing one pair of them now. My feet are warm and I know these will go through the wash about two hundred times with all my other clothes and socks before I need to buy a new pair... unless they disappear into that mysterious place where socks go (you know... the laundry room ""black hole"" or ""sock heaven"")."
3,Ponderous but Moving,"I've read some very humorous golf novels. This is not one of them. The humor others are referring to escaped me, although certainly there are some very funny and/or biting passages.I agree with the other reviewers who question some of the slower parts of the book. The underlying theme of giving up one's dream and the associated pain/relief did resonate with me, however, actually quite deeply.I'd recommend it to my friends who are readers of literature but certainly not the casual reader--especially not the casual sports novel reader!"
5,Within Sacred Circles: Meditations & Mandala Quilts,"The quilts in this book are beautiful and an inspiration for meditation. The writing surrounding the thought of the quilt is enjoyable, and some new information is always presented. I would recommend this book for anyone who meditates and/or anyone who quilts."
4,Old Show finally Gets a Release,"It's been awhile since I saw this show, but like most of you, I thought it was cool and an original concept at the time. Since it's marked as Season 1, I don't expect the movies to be on it. Tekwar, Teklords, Teklab, & TekJustice were the TV movies based on the books and were released before there ever was a series. I don't know why some TV show sites list them as episodes. They do the same thing with Nick Knight and Forever Knight.I haven't bought this set yet. I was wondering if anyone could give me an accurate running time or list of episodes offered in this set. Thanks in advance."
2,About What I Expected,This series was nothing to rave about. I think I was most excited about seeing the actress who played Andromeda. She was ina few of the episodes briefly. I didn't quite agree with a lot of the other reviewers about the plots being all that interesting. I enjoyed this only because i enjoy science fiction. I would recommend buying it only if you can find it under $30 somewhere.

4,Excellent,Excellent. Great footage of action on various fronts in World War 2.I purchased this item because of its footage of the Submarine Tangrescuing downed airmen in the Pacific. I'm looking forward to the futurereleases of this series.
3,Sophomore Jinx,"The second in a series is often disappointing failing to live up to the promise a first book, such is the case with Richard Hawke's COLD DAY IN HELL. Mr. Hawke, who also writes the wonderful Hearse mysteries under the name Tim Cockey, established a strong character in Fritz Malone in SPEAK OF THE DEVIL but does nothing with him this time around. This isn't a bad book but it drags almost from the beginning only to pick up in a series of two page chapters towards the end but never really kicks into gear and the final action sequences are disjointed, contradictory and, in the end, unsatifing. Mr. Hawke/Cockey has done much better in the past and, based on his terrific track record, should do better in the future. As for this one, wait for the paperback."
3,Author writes better as Tim Cockey,"While I enjoyed this book and it was a reasonably good mystery, I didn't think it held a candle to the books the author writes under the name Tim Cockey which feature protagonist Hitchcock Sewell. The characters in that series of books, which all feature the word ""Hearse"" somewhere in the title, are so much more quirky, personable and endearing. Had I read Richard Hawke first and then found out he also wrote as Tim Cockey, I don't know that I would have searched out the Tim Cockey books, but on the strength of the Tim Cockey books alone, I searched out the Richard Hawkes books. Again, they weren't BAD books, they just weren't the caliber that I expected, so I encourage other readers to also investigate the Hearse series - I think you'll find them an enjoyable read if you like your mysteries a little on the offbeat side."
3,Just okay....,"Fritz is still a character I like and want to read about. However, COLD DAY IN HELL didn't match the page-turning quality SPEAK OF THE DEVIL had.I want Hitchcock Sewell back........sigh."
4,Quality Seems Top Notch,"Really like the apparent quality of this bag. Too early to give it a long-term review, but initial impressions are that it is very well built and very stylish. --NMH in Texas"
2,this one's for REAL HAPPYdancers...,"This is some real happy, body and soul type of vocal house. Not enough attitude or aggressiveness for my tastes. But If you're a fan of this style of house, here's a time listing:1. Just Be Yourself (5:08)2. I'll Take You There (6:42)3. Stop Playing with My Mind (6:04)4. That Sound (5:41)5. Time out For Love (5:26)6. Must be the Music (6:13)7. Make a Move on Me (6:35)8. Believe in Love (6:01)9. Take you to Love (6:22)10. Just me and You (5:22)11. Garden of love (5;17)"
3,"Fun, but without the video...","...it sounds just like a dozen other dance music CD's.Great cover art photography (a staple feature of the Global Groove CD series), and a nice selection of upbeat dance tunes here. So, it's PLAYful and fun.But the music here is so 1970's, so old hat, so been-there|done-that; GLOBAL GROOVE is in a deep rut in this department. The most frustrating aspect of the music here is the fact that nearly every song starts out with a great pulsing beat, and then degenerates midway through into late 1970's/early 1980's disco mush.More of the adventurous underground stuff; breakbeats, polyrhythmic techno and frankly, a bit faster tempo in most of the songs would all enhance sales and listener interest I suspect."
3,detangler experiment,"I bought 8 different brands of detanglers as i am a groomer & have been putting them all thru the test,Best bet is to use a product which has a slight oil feel to it if your plan is to detangle a pets coat."
1,Is a clean coat worth your dog's health,"Do your research before using any product on your pet. While the results sounded great, I was concerned there was no listing of the chemical contents. I found the MSDS sheet for The Stuff and found four hazardous chemicals in this product: Trimethylnonyl Ethylene-Gylcol Ether; Acetaldehyde; Formaldehyde; Dioxane. Some of these chemicals are potential carcinogens. I would highly suggest using an all natural alternative to this product. Less chemicals means heathier, happier pets!"
5,So Soft!,"My dog's coat feels like cashmere after using this product. OK, I might be exaggerating a little but seriously his coat is much, much softer and it seems to be staying cleaner....unless it is my imagination. Alot of people recommended this product to me. I am glad i finally listened to them."
5,Glad I Found This Stuff,"This product is exactly what I needed for my dog. It was always difficult to brush my little poodle mix because it required tugging. I tried to be gentle, but brushing seemed to hurt her and she naturally hated it.As soon as I received this product I applied it and let it dry. It made her fur very smooth. The brush goes through her fur more easily, with less pulling. She still hates to be brushed, but it requires less time to finish.P.S. Since my dog's fur is curly and I don't clip it real short, using a lot of short, quick strokes works best."
5,These are cute and durable,"We got these for our dog and my mother's dog. Our dog loved it and carried it around for quite some time. My mom's dog decided he needed to play with it outside and a neighbor dog took it from him and ran under a fence that my mother's dog could not fit under. So, the toy is so good everyone wants one!They are very durable and the crinkle effect entices dogs to play with it."
2,Doggy Hoots Cracklers,Not as enthusiastic as previous reviewers. I ordered one for each of my dogs. They were smaller than I expected and they did not last a day. After reading reviews I ordered both the chipmuck and rabbit but was highly disappointed. Not as tough as advertised.
5,Revere Copper Cuisine,"The items arrived in amzing time and condition. Almost too beautiful to use! I was a little concerned when the bottoms turned black after first use, but with a little vinegar and salt, the copper was restored to almost-new."
2,Lining quality poor!,"After just a month 2 pans had flaws on the inside where the lining came off or something in spots, now 4 are like that."
4,Good for the price,"These pans are great for cooking in that they heat up extremely quickly. However, after every use, I have to clean the bottoms of them with copper cleaner adding another step to the cleaning process."
2,Not worth even that little money I paid for it.,"Size WAY too big. Even for my husband, who is definitely not a small person. Gloves tend to come off, so it's not really what I was looking for. The Sam's Club brand is actually better, althought cost a bit more. But you get what you pay for.Do not recommend this, waste of $$."
3,Capacity?,"This thing is really smaller than it looks. It's description says 7.5 quarts, but I bet it's only 5 quarts -- I haven't measured it. My Ford Flex hold 6 quarts of oil, so changing its oil might be a 2-step process."
3,Bit smaller than it looks,"I agree with other reviews, it is smaller than the picture indicates. It does hold all of the oil (5.5 quarts) for my car, but I am fortunate to have a level garage floor to change the oil on. Any volume greater than 5.5 quarts will be pushing the limits. You must also have a fairly large funnel to dump the oil in a container as well, as the lip is quite large for pouring purposes."
3,Is it 7.5 qt?,"Obviously, it can hold 7.5 qt but if your car holds ~5.5qt of oil I would opt for something larger. My cars hold ~5qt and it gets full quickly, to the point that its tough to not have an exxon valdez moment on the floor of your garage. For smaller capacity cars this is great. Anything engine with bigger than ~5qt of capacity I would opt for something larger so its easier to handle when full."
4,Very Helpful,"Being of french descent my husband and I wanted to honor our heratige, we found many wonderful names in this book as well as a fairly good pronunciation guide. I was a little disapointed with the organization of the book and there was not enough history provided but overall the book really helpped us out, we chose Sabine for our daughter."
5,ROTFLMAO,"Hadn't heard from Bobcat in years but caught up with him recently with an HBO special. This recording helped fill in some gaps. I love his energy and never knew he was so good at 'other' voices. Though some of the material is dated , it is still very funny and would recommend this to anyone who loves standup comedy."
5,He hasn't lost it! He's a great comic!,"Crewd, lewd, - it's Bobcat - what do you expect? Heis really funny, even retelling his life as a comedianis funny when he tells it. If you like Bobcat, you willlike this!"
5,Incredible,"Guillermo David has made a very deep research on the life, thinking and production of Witold Gombrowicz, the polish-argentinian phiolosopher-writer. Few people knows so much about Witold as he does."
2,If you know nothing about making beats youtube is better.,"If this information wasn't availible for free on youtube in much greater detail it would get a three from me. It is fairly well produced for the price.He basically shows you his keyboard, an MPC and talks about sample CD (very briefly). There is NO DETAIL WHATSOEVER ON THIS DVD!!!He basically goes ""here's an MPC, here's me tapping on the pads, here's the finished beat, see easy"". Then he gets ""industry insiders"" to tell you to get a lawyer before trying to sell beats.Seriously I have just told you all the (useful) information that is on this DVD. Avoid it unless you don't have access to the internet and can't type MPC, Korg Triton and Acid Music into the search bar."
2,I don't remember...,"When this appeared on my ""purchase"" list I had forgotten that I bought it for my 15 year old for Christmas. I bought him several other products and I've heard the least about this one."
2,A problem with tempo,"A routine, throw-away tale bearing all the hallmarks of an author who feels comfortable enough to just keep churning 'em out. One example: the Wexfords, in California, telephone home and reference is made to the time difference, remarking that the UK is 8 hours behind California. It should of course be the other way round! This mistake is repeated several times. In a mystery, everything can be a clue and this is just the sort of thing a reader will take note of. Well, the reader needn't bother -- the author didn't."
3,"Entertaining, but ultimately forgettable","Sir Manuel Camargue is found dead in the lake near his estate. Is it an accident, or is it murder? Mix in a too-young fiancee, Inspector Wexford, a daughter who may not be a daughter, and a trip to the south of France and you have another very readable Rendell. Very typical for her work, never getting far from the mold-- I find that her best books are the ones that deviate in some way from the typical Wexford mysteries."
1,Read this to be paranoid throughout your pregnancy,"Although this book is written from the standpoint of presenting the facts, it does so in a warped and paranoid way. The ""facts"" presented in this book are not the facts but the author's extreme ideas presented from extreme reported examples that are perfect to make any mother-to-be paranoid about her pregnancy. This book will make you believe that having sex WILL cause you to have a miscarriage (which is extremely rare!) In addition, the author speculates that having one x-ray at any time in your life will cause all of your future offspring to be deformed... which could not be more FALSE. This book sells lies instead of the helpful information a mother-to-be will need. In my profession I have already had to council the fears of a young mother who read this book and received all of the wrong information."
5,Health and Beauty,I would recommend this product to other consumers. I am happy with this product. Shipment time was excellent. I would purchase again.
3,Excerpts from Primary Documents related to British Africa,"For ""Tales from the Dark Continent"" the author visited with or read diaries of various officials of the British colonial government in Africa. Excerpts are grouped according to subject: colonial administration, living conditions, travel, spouses, etc. Differences in various British African colonies become apparent, e.g., in Nigeria the British were concerned mainly with governing a large African population, while the Kenya colony was developed with European settlers in mind. The book is often interesting and amusing, especially the reproductions of advertisments for clothing and other essentials. This book would be valuable to students of African colonial history and British imperialism.The same author did a similar treatment of British India. I think these books were somehow related to BBC television documentaries."
2,lots of fluff.,Aside from a monoply variation I didn't get much out of this. Most of the games I had never even heard of and I play a lot of games.
3,Future Appreciation,"I skimmed through this and there were interesting options to jazz up games. I didn't find anything amazing, but perhaps it will come in handy one rainy day."
4,No mess!,"I used this step ladder potty seat with our children and just bought another 23 years later for a grandchild. I like that you do not need to empty and wipe or wash out a potty bowl, rather, all business goes in the toilet, ready to flush. And, the kids like the ladder, once they get the hang of it.One downside is that the guard in front is a little low, making the boy need to lean forward forward so his urine stream doesn't overshoot the seat and go on the floor.Easy to assemble, handy to have beside the toilet. (Does not stay in place with the toilet lid lowered.)"
4,confidence booster!,"My daughter was born premature and still has some physical limitations. She is the second child and wanted to use the ""big potty"" like her older brother. The Primo potty allowed her to do this. We purchased this product about 3 months ago and my daughter has figured out how to set it up herself. It has been a great tool to build her self confidence (not bad physical therapy either) I appreciate less mess to clean up. The assembly instructions were consisted of only minimal pictures. I figured out how to put it together after a couple of attempts and lots of laughing. My only concerns are that it is held together by thumb screws which are easily removed by bored or inquisitive children. If the seat isn't placed just right it is a little unstable feeling for the child. When on the toilet correctly, it is very sturdy. Practice with your child!"
1,Buyer's remorse,"The product is flimsy, the step is too close to the toilet to be practical for a child to step up on, the deflector is not tall enough to deflect any urine, and the seat is too large for a toddler. My child does not feel comfortable using this potty."
3,Nice set up,I like the way it is set up but I don't like that if you have slippery floors it does not stay planted on the floor it slides on the bottom there is no support on the bottom just plastic so it tends to slide
2,"Not for oblong toilets, kinda flimsy",The idea is good...but it does not sit well on oblong toilets. The adjustable step is a great feature as my sons feet could not reach the other step stools we have used before we bought this apparatus.Would recommend with round toilet only.
2,Too flimsy and unstable for child to feel secure enough to go to the bathroom,"This seat is very unstable. My son is more worried about falling than he is about going to the bathroom. I love the fact that the stool and chair are in one. I also like the fact that is was made in the usa, but I would not buy this again. I ended up with the bjorn seat and the potty stool stepper that cost $129. It tall enough and stable."
2,doesn't fit,"The ladder for this seat did not touch the floor. We had to send it back because it was about an inch or two short. If you do decide to try the product, you should measure your toilet first. That said, I do agree with some of the other postings that it seemed rather flimsy. Even if it had reached the floor, the seat did not fit firmly on the seat. Perhaps its just made for other toilets."
4,Great for early trainers!,This potty seat works great for my 21 month old. She can set it up and get on the potty herself. It folds easily to put on the side when not in use.It didn't get 5 stars because it is a little flimsy and would not work as well for a larger child.
3,Seat Opening Too Big,"The product idea is good. My 2 year old daughter jumped right onto the the step to go onto the potty. The problem is, the seat opening is too wide and she had to hold onto the handles to prevent ""falling in"". She did not feel secure and comfortable on the seat itself. My baby girl is 32 inches tall, and with the step to the highest location, her feet still couldn't touch the step when sat down."
3,A little flimsy,"This fits our elongated bowl, so I don't know how well it would work on a regular bowl. It is easy for my three year old to put on and take off himself, but the plastic is flimsy. When he takes one hand off the handles to turn around and sit down, the whole thing leans to the side he is still using for support, threatening to flip off. My son has learned to adjust and not lean so hard on it. A timid child might be too frightened to use it. That is why I only gave it three stars. It is a fabulous idea, it just needs to be made more stable."
4,Item is great but parts missing,We really like the potty trainer but the rubber feet inserts were missing
5,The best Way to teach Babys to use toilet,"I Had almost 6 months trying to teach my Baby girl to use the toiled.I tried everything but this (from asking every 5 minutes to Punishment).When i give her the PRIMO Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) as a gift, it was the last they she did not use the toilet, exactly as it sounds...no more diapers!Item is:Easy to assembleConfortableSecureMess ProofI recommend it"
1,Worst product for toilet training!,"I ordered this to have for 2yr old granddaughter, while it is easy to put together. The step is at a angle, and the seat did fit or cove the toilet. I sent this back the exact same day, because its a piece of junk."
2,just a little scary,"This Toilet Trainer seems like it could break easily. I wish I had purchased two separate items, the footstool and the seat. I like that it sets the baby forward on the ring, so he can bend his legs, however, this is the only thing I like about it.I'm worried that the plastic nuts and bolts will strip or give out. He's not too interested in it since he figured out that when he gets up on the step, there's no way to turn around without my help. It does not seem stable or safe."
4,Does the trick,"I was looking for something that would allow my 2 year old to use our toilet w/ minimal assistance. She is able to step up, turn around and sit on the smaller seat unassisted (the turn around is still a bit tricky but she's got it down). The product is a bit flimsy and on one of our toilets it does not sit nicely, but overall I am pleased w/ the product"
3,Flimsy but useful.,"Not a very sturdy item. The blue rubber pieces on it that are supposed to keep it from sliding around don't work that great and fell out. I tried gluing them back in but still lost a few. It is, however, useful. My 30lb 2.8 year old who is mostly potty trained is supported even though it creaks. She can get on and off by herself as long as her clothes around her legs don't restrict her too much. She can also put in on the toilet and take it off by herself. The raised part in front doesn't always keep the pee in but I don't think any product is perfect in that respect. Not too difficult to clean. It's worth the low price we paid for it."
1,Cheap,"This product was not worth it. It's cheap because it's cheaply made. It's not very sturdy and often wobbles off the toilet bowl when my toddler is sitting on it. It's not sturdy enough that she's willing to get up on it by herself and the foot rest is so small that she can't turn around on it. To top it off, after a few months, it broke, so we just threw it away!"
5,"Great concert, from the good times.","I have to start saying that Im not a teenager and Im not homophobic, (or gay). And I really enjoy this concert, the art has many different expressions and this guy gives to the voice, performance and orchestra music a very good level of art. It does look of course at the 90's style but its really a enjoyable performance. For all latinoamerican people its a must have, and for non Spanish talking people still it is a good thing to see and listen."
4,"good story, no maps",This a very readable biography of E.J. King with one major flaw...no maps so you can easily follow along. It is very detailed and follows King's travels and decisions but would have been helped a lot with at least several area maps. Can't believe the USNI didn't see the need for this. How naive and disappointing.
4,Great Read,I was pleasently surprised by this book . I enjoyed the pace of the book as well as the characters and quickly found myself emersed in thier world and struggles. The story really came alive for me and I will now wait anxiously await the continuation of the story in the 2nd and 3rd books.You won't be disappionted with this purchase.
4,Good Fast Paced,To be quite honest the plot was thin and there where few new elements that I haven't seen in other books. However that being said this is probably one of the most focused and fun reads I have had in a while. The book doesn't get bogged down in detail but rushes headlong to the cliff hanger of an ending. If you can enjoy a book that isn't serious and full of its self than this is a good book for you.
1,New age elements,"Leathel Grody is a promising writer. He builds a compelling story. However I would not put this title under the Christian catagory. The main character is encouraged to build her ability to read minds and speak into other's minds and such. Revelation tells us these types of abilities will become more prevelent during the latter days. Anytime we try to exercise powers outside ourselves without looking to God we are in deep danger. For more information on that danger please read ""The Latent Power of the Soul"" by Watchman Nee. Its an excellent little book. I hope Leathel reads it - its a great eye opener to the pitfalls of the sometimes subtle dangers of the new age."
4,Overall a good book,This book reviews the exam properly and is good to compliment a study guide. I used it to pass the exam easily.
3,Can't get pass with this book only,"I make a wrong choice, since I suppose it is a book for test practice. Finally, I find it is a book of revision. Anyway, treat it as a revision book before taking the exam, don't treat it as a training guide. Overall, this book is not bad. But, I think if you have brought a training guide, you can just simply ignore this book."
2,Heavy going,"Heavy going, as it should be, I guess. As with any book of this type, it is only for initiates (if you don't know what this last sentence means, don't buy the book), this is a very academic approach to tantra. I should have ready the sleeve more carefully before purchase, as if I had realised that the book is a re-print of the author's PhD thesis on one particular sadana which I am not and don't need to be familiar with, I wouldn't have bought it. In saying that though, the introductory pages (which make up about half the book) are well written and do prove interesting to read about the subject when it is written from such an academic perspective. Lots of intellectual rumination, but no heart. Goes to show why the it is Wisdom AND Method that really matters if you are on the path..."
5,Everyone should read this,"Anyone who has experienced trials in their life should read this book. It is filled with humor, personal insight and a faith in our Triune God that is so deep you can feel it down to your toes. Janet has managed to capture a multitude of emotions in each story she tells of her faith walk to Jesus. She is truly an inspiration."
4,A Good Read,"Gods In Alabama is a book whose pages are filled with characters that are highly reminiscent of people we've all known at some time in our life. These characters struggle with issues that face us during the many different stages of our life. As I read the book I was intrigued by the many facets of the relationships within the book; Arlene and Clarise, Clarise and Aunt Flo, Aunt Flo and Arlene, Arlene and Burr, etc. In many ways it makes you realize that all relationships are in some way flawed because we as individuals are flawed. In spite of the flaws, we live, we love, and we perserve because relationships are what give life meaning. In addition, the theme touches on the expectations placed upon us by society versus those which we place upon ourselves. --A worthwhile read."
5,LOVED this book,"I don't get to read that many books anymore, as I'm a stay-at-home mom to a one year old boy who is into everything! And I write even fewer reviews... in fact, can't remember the last one I wrote. But I just loved ""gods in Alabama""! I'm a big fan of the Southern dysfunctional family genre, as well as the murder mystery/legal thriller genre, and this is a fantastic mix of both. I read it in the space of about 24 hours, in the midst of chasing around after my son, and I can assure you it's a great, fun read with a couple of twists that you will NEVER see coming. I don't want to spoil the book, but the redemption at the end was also really satisfying to me. Thanks Joshilyn Jackson, I'll be on the lookout for your next book!"
3,Gods in Alabama,"I liked this book but it wasn't very 'meaty'. There were a few lines that literally made me lol and anytime a books gets me to show emotion like that, whether it's laughing, crying, anger etc... I have to give it credit. Still, I feel it was lacking something.Would I recommend it? Probably."
2,Disappointing,"I truly wanted to like this book. The first couple of chapters were good and I was hooked. As the book progressed, however, it went downhill. Most of the characters seemed like cariactures to me, especially Lena's mother and aunt Florence (who actually is a truly warped character--I found the Phoebe the chicken story fairly disturbing). Many of the flashbacks are overly drawn out, and I kept thinking, ""who cares?"" By about 2/3rds of the way through the book, I no longer cared what happened. Like I said, I wanted to like this book and was bitterly disappointed especially after reading so many great reviews here. I do think the story concept had potential. Hopefully Jackson's future books will be better."
2,"Would have been better without the ""F"" word","I like this book, but the overuse of the ""F"" word made it hard to want to keep reading. The author used this word constantly, and after reading it 10 times on one page, I would sometimes have to just put the book down. I think she could have conveyed her point by other words instead of this one, especially since no other four letter words were used very often if at all. Plus, it is had to get started on and drags on a while, only to end the way you predicted."
5,gods in Alabama,"Ordered used and the owner must have shipped the day they got the order. The product came boxed as I expected, in good order. All the disks played well without problems. Nothing to do with the purchase is the fact that this is a good read. Thanks"
3,Kinda boring....,"I'm going to keep this simple and short. I only finished it because I wanted to get my money worth out of it. It was okay not good, but only okay."
4,underappreciated debut,"I eschew Chick Lit, and I hesitate about potentially melodramatic thrillers. Fortunately, this is neither. Ms. Jackson has created full, complex and sympathetic (if not always likeable) characters with comprehensible motives. In so many ways, this is a story about family, loyalties and the things you will do for someone you love. Funny, serious and remarkably, not schmaltzy or overwrought, Ms. Jackson has crafted a real, if not politically correct, depiction of adolescent sexuality and expection."
5,Love this book,"This book is amazing, I love the author and the book is very well written. MUST READ!!! This is the book that made me read the rest of her books. I love the southern diction and the voice she uses with her characters. This book will make you want to read the rest of her books."
3,Couldnt Get Into It,"I read mostly non-fiction so perhaps that's it but I believe I can appreciate a good story.A picked this up in the ""Southern Fiction"" section a local independent bookstore thinking let me read something different than my usual fare.Goofy girl trying to make sense of a goofy life. I just didnt connect with her the story just seemed bland."
2,Just disappointed,"After reading all the reviews on here, and picking up and putting the book back several times. I was disappointed. Maybe I had my hope up to high. I just wasn't that impressed."
1,Hated It,"I can appreciate the authors style of writing. However, I found this book to be a shallow misrepresentation of female power. What the women do in this book is extreme vigilantism, but we're supposed to applaud it in the name of ""girl power"". This was no ""Time to kill"", where murder was justified. I kept waiting to read something that made me want to see someone killed.. it never happened. Murder isn't cute or funny, but again, we're supposed to think so because the murderers were victims of a heinous crime, and FEMALE, so its okay... gosh its even funny. We're supposed to feel warm and fuzzy that the main character gets on with her life, I didn't. I came away annoyed with the whole premise."
1,First and last book I'll read by this author,I find it difficult to understand how so many people could rate this book as highly as they have. I literally had to force myself through the 7th chapter and at the beginning of the 8th chapter decided to put it down.The protagonist in this story is an overly promiscuous murderer who falsely attempts to justify her utterly contemptible and immoral act of sleeping with every boy in her high school class as well as the murder of the star quarterback as heroic deeds in defense of her cousin.I picked up this book only because of the rave reviews and I've learned that we can't always trust the reviews of others. What a disappointment.
2,I Don't Get It???????,Why all the hype on this book? After the first two chapters the book goes downhill fast. It's terrible the way some people hype up a book to get a reading audience only to have them become thoroughly disappointed. Pass this one over and don't waste your money on it. Wish I could get mine back.
2,A chore,"This was a chore for me to read. I finished it, but it wasn't easy. I had no sympathy for any of the characters, and just found most of them to be annoying."
1,Disappointing,"I have never read a more predictable story in my life. There was no drama and the characters were utterly boring. It was such a caricature of Alabama that it completely missed the mark. I live in Alabama and trust me I know. I also felt like it ripped off a lot of Lucky and The lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. If you haven't read those, skip this and get them both."
4,GOod Read,I am from Alabama so the title intrigued me. A little different than the uusal romance novel. Most of her assumptions were right on target. Nice to have a new author to read and I look forward to reading more from her.
5,Brilliant Writing!!!,"I picked up this book the other day and finished it in two sittings - if I hadn't had to get off the airplane, it would have been only one. This is the most interesting, well written book I have read in years. Joshilyn Jackson creates a totally believable set of southern characters and all the uniqueness that goes along with them. There is such a depth of emotion and thought and the plot provides enough twists to keep even the most stawart critic of pacing happy. I thoroughly enjoyed this book - immediately bought the next - which I am reading now, and can't wait for her next."
4,Gods Was Good,"I read this book because the author went to high school with me. At first, I felt like it was a little too ""dark"" for me. I stuck with it though and was pleased with how it turned out. It was funny, soaked in southern humor and kept me interested all the way through."
4,Great Narrator,"This book is everything the other reviewers say: it's funny, clever, at times suspenseful, and a quick read. But what I liked most about Gods inAlabama was the complexity of its narrator. Although Arlene is Southern and religious, she is anything but typical. She has a slutty past, academic degrees, an African American fiance, intense loyalty to her friends and family, a pact with Jesus never to tell a lie and ... what else? Oh, yeah, she once murdered someone. And the great thing is -- it's all believable.Rita Bleiman ""Dirty Tricks"""
1,Didn't Even Finish It,"I decided to read this book based on the rave reviews it received, and didn't make it past the half-way point. I could not identify with (or understand) the main character at all. In fact, I found almost all of the characters to be contrived and stereotypical. Jackson's description of the south was just as stereotypical as her characters. The lack of originality, however, paled in comparison to the weak narration. Overall, I was completely unimpressed. I forced myself through the first several chapters, but didn't finish it because I just didn't care how it ended."
4,You can run but you can't hide!,"Arlene made a promise to God. If she didn't get caught for the murder of Jim Beverly, she promises to not sleep with any more men and to never ever go back to her hometown in Alabama. Even if her aunt and mom call her up every week begging.Her boyfriend, Burr, thinks she won't go down there and introduce him to her family because she is embarrassed of him. They get into a tiff about it.Rose-Pop shows up at the college where Arlene works and wants to know what she knows about Jim Beverly missing. Arlene avoids Rose so Rose leaves a note saying she will just ask Clarice, Arlene's cousin. Afraid Clarice will spill the beans about Jim, Arlene finally decides to go home after 10 years.What did happen that night with Jim Beverly and why would Arlene hate him so much? How will Arlene's family feel about Burr being a different race?Read this fast paced book and find out the mystery!"
5,Splendid,"I didn't quite know what to expect from this book, I read the backcover quickly and thought I was in for a stereotyped relationship between Southern girl and black guy, and a difficult family. This book is so much more than that. Lena is a great heroine, and we embark with her on a story where she revisits and tries to make sense of her past and how she came to make some difficult decisions. We peel back the layers to understand the role of family, redemption, forgiveness, and how a set of circumstances can influence and impact Lena's and her family's life to such an extent.This is a splendid story. Joshilyn Jackson is one very talented writer and I definitely look forward to reading more from her soon. Very very highly recommended."
4,Great book...,I enjoyed this book a great deal. I thought it was original and very well written. I particularity liked the way the author told the story by switching from past to present with each chapter. The way the story unfolded worked very well for me. I found the characters to be very real and believable. I would have like to have had more of Burr's mama in the story and wouldn't you have loved to have known what happened when Arlene and Burr showed up at Bruster's party? Great book from this first time author.
5,So Very Good,"From the opening lines, when the author familiarizes the reader with the gods of the title, I was hooked. I bought this book after reading, and loving ""Between, Ga"" and wasn't disappointed. Many reviews have done great justice to the plot so a synopsis won't be included in this review.The book is well written; the characters are sharp, complicated and just a little on the crazy side; the plot is well conceived with a very nice mystery to solve; the story moves quickly; and the book is quirky enough to earn the ""southern fiction"" label it so richly deserves. (A gentle reminder to readers, southern folk aren't crazier than the rest of the world, we just embrace and accept our insanity.) If you are looking for a well written novel with a great story to tell this would be an excellent choice. If you like a book where all is not exactly what it seems, this novel hits the mark. If you enjoy a good laugh, this novel will satisfy your needs. I give this book by highest recommendation."
4,She writes so well -,"Smart, funny, all the things you look for in a book to spend some time with. Can't wait to read her #2."
3,Good ...but Quite Disturbing,"I really liked this book, the characters, and the plot. It was a very entertaining page turner and I stayed up late reading it two nights in a row. However, most of the reviews I have read don't mention the explicit profanity and violence. It overuses the f-word and has graphic depictions of rape and other violence. The compulsive teen sex was especially disturbing. I think these things should be mentioned so that you are aware of what you are getting into, because you probably won't be able to put it down after starting it."
5,A Man's Book As Much As A Woman's,"No chick lit found here between the covers of this cross between Southern Gothic, Murder Mystery, Love Story and funny as hell book.While I'm willing to bet dollars to donuts most of Mrs. Jackson's readers and reviewers are women-given the cover art used on all her novels-I highly recommend this romp through L.A. (Lower Alabama) to men. You will see the good, bad and ugly that's in us all. You will see Southern women as they really are-full of grit, grace and guts, and not the Southern stereotype Southern Bell of yesteryear.Whatever your sex, Mrs. Jackson polished prose draws you in and crawls all over your brain cells like Kudzu and doesn't let you go until she ends her novel.John LeeAuthor (under the pen name Richard ""Dixie"" Hartwell), When the Buddha Met Bubba"
2,Was hoping for more,"When I read the reviews on this book and all the press that had been written about it, I was looking forward to reading it. It's well written and has decent characters, but the crazy is just too easily forgiven. There was always a reason someone was the way they were, instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they blamed it on that reason. The book is a decent day or two read, but I was looking for more."
3,"I was spoiled by ""Grown-Up Kind of Pretty""","My first introduction to Joshilyn Jackson was ""Grown-Up Kind of Pretty."" I thought her story-telling was fabulous, her characters were strong and I was immersed in the book from page 1. So I was really ready to read another book by her. While ""Gods in Alabama"" was a good book, it wasn't as well-written as ""Grown-Up."" It almost seemed like she was trying too hard to have funny characters and have them do odd things -- which is a shame because the overall story was really, really good. Loved the ending but the story got off the track along the way a couple of times."
3,Ok,"That's literally all I have to say about it. I thought Lena (Arlene) the main character, Rose Mae Lolley and Jeff Beverly were totally unbelievable and unlikable characters. I would not read it again."
4,CLUB ANTHEM - HAPPENIN ALL OVER AGAIN!,"There are two very strong tracks on No Regret. Those are Happenin' All Over Again and Gonna Catch You! Could easily be a club anthem for years to come. They should put you out on the dance floor. Other luke warm songs include: Do You Want It, Dirty Love, A God That Can Dance and Edge of 17. The other 8 tracks I didn't care for but I feel if you like 3-4 songs on an album it's a MUST HAVE:-)"
4,happenin' all over again.,"though lonnie gordon has suffered relative obscurity since her 1993 release _bad mood_--which produced the dance anthems ""bad mood"", ""gonna catch you"" and ""happening all over again""--she returns with this greatest hits collection that does not disappoint. five songs from _bad mood_ are paired with other gordon classics and some more recent tracks. most notable among them are ""a god that can dance"", which gordon premiered at the sydney, australia mardi gras, and a disco rework of stevie nick's ""edge of 17"". this collection shows that gordon has no reason to have any regrets as she is an accomplished vocalist who consistently produces quality work."
5,Nice collection of hits........,"This is a great collection of hits. All the PWL hits are here, plus the Black Box tracks from her second album. The few Quartz Lock tracks make it a must have for the true Lonnie fan. My only regret, wheres Love Eviction?"
5,Kind of Biased,"To the reader from Jackson Hole WY. I am sorry that you found my novel to be without any saving grace. I have my doubts as to wether you have actually read it, but be that as it may, if you will return the book to me, I will refund double your money. My e-mail address is thethunderrider@yahoo.com contact me to make arrangements.Chris MadoniaThe Author"
3,"Great looking, but durability a question","I like these sandals for their comfort and look, but I've had them for less than 2 months and they have almost completely broken apart."
2,Very unimpressive for O2,"I have been an Oval Opus fan for a long time every since they came out with Wagon Wheel back in 97 and when I first heard this album I was unimpressed. The only song on here that I found to be the least bit impressive was ""Let Go"" other then that, this album sucks"
4,A FINE VIROLOGY YARDSTICK,"There is hardly any significant fact about viruses that missed-out in this edition of ""Fields Virology"". Page after page, this sound all-inclusive reference doles out authoritative information on both viruses and viral syndromes. From taxonomy to etiology, metamorphosis to replication; the analyses of this text is grand. The same applies to its attached CD-ROM. Its practical outlook was intended to benefit both microbiologists and pathologists. Bernard Fields and his colleagues made their mark with this book. It is a great effort.However, most botanist may not be pleased to know that little attention was paid to plant viruses. Again, many potential buyers may be demoralized by the rather high price that this virology-set demands."
2,"Again, not up to par","After the disappointment I felt with Ms. Wright's first book, Blush, I thought the second book would surely be an improvement. Sad to say, the same mistakes made in the first were made in the second. Rehashed dialogue and repeats of same scenes were in this too. It is as if it wasn't properly edited. Hearing Jenna, the lead characted moan and cry throughout the whole book about how she wasn't good enough got real old. Again, a missed opportunity to tell what could have been a great story about the hustle and bustle of the black elite of Washington, DC. I think this author should give up writing romantic fiction or take a few more writing classes."
1,Didn't like this one at all,"I hated this book, I felt that the leading lady in the book Jenna was selfish and only out for self, and that Mike should have just left her along."
1,The bindings are terrible,"Sorry to rain on the rosy reviews, but these snowshoes leave much to be desired. The biggest deficiency is the bindings, which are absolutely awful. I came here to price check these snowshoes, since I expected them to be about $50. I couldn't believe that anyone would pay $140 for these when there are so many superior products on the market.I typically use a pair of Atlas Snowshoes. The atlas bindings are super secure yet highly adjustable and the nylon pull closures can be adjusted with a glove on.This weekend, I rented a pair of the MSR, and the cheap rubber buckles came undone several times over the course of a hike. There is no room in my closet for any bad gear, especially when it costs the same as good stuff.It's disappointing, because MSR makes some good stuff. Not these."
3,"Great Traction, Not a lot of flotation, bindings are a pain","Once you get these on, which can take a while, they stay on. I have had no problems with my feet slipping around or coming out of the bindings. When I hike with these I barely notice anything on my feet. They are small in size so the flotation is not as good as larger snowshoes. That is the price you pay for having snowshoes you barely know are there. These have excellent traction for more challenging terrain."
1,Deceptive,"Bought these snowshoes two winters ago for out of track trekking.They rapidly show signs of wear but I didn't mind as different sellers told me that they were indestructibles.But after using them well, maybe 20 times, the plastic frame broke.If you intend to do snowshoeing off the beaten then go for another model."
2,Unauthentic writing,"This biography of Babaji indicates the authors lack of true experience in the tradition he attempts to write about.I fully agree with many of the other criticisms of this book.It is, in its own light - highly uncorroborated & inconsistent."
1,Not worth reading,"Marshall Govindan of Montreal, Canada credentials are questionable as a Guru, and his books and lessons render many inaccuracies from this ancient tradition.The Kriya yoga lessons in his Canadian Ashram are not the same original techniques taught by Shyama Charan Lahiri, known best as Sri Lahiri Mahasaya in 'The Autobiography of a Yogi' by Sri Yogananda; and as rendered by other kriya yoga lineages in this tradition since 1861.Before you embark in the practice of this ""secret"" Raja Yoga practice from Mr Govinda. Ask yourself the real motives behind his 1991 publications about Babaji's ""new"" techniques and then use your own judgement based on your study and research.Since the publication of Autobiography of a Yogi by Sri Paramahamsa Yogananda Giri in 1946, many people have claimed that they had met Mahavatar Babaji and that he supposedly continues revising and sharing new pranayama techniques of kriya Yoga to the World.Think thrice before spending a cent on this book."
5,Read This Book - Truly a Rare Gem!,"A brilliant and captivating insight into the lives of the great masters of ancient India. Not only did these great masters such as Babaji, Siddha Agastyar, and Swami Ramalinga attain various siddhas and enlightenment through Kriya yoga, they were able to transform their physical bodies into pure light bodies. If you would like to study further into the teachings of these great masters, get The One Minute Guide to Prosperity and Enlightenment by Sri Siva. The author, Sri Siva, is a reincarnation of both Siddha Agastyar and Swami Ramalinga, and he teaches manifestation and spiritual techniques through the use of mantras."
1,false,"About Babji we can trust only one source - Yognanda.This book is poor copy of Yogananada account, and is very much imagination of author.It is not so difficult to see that behind the story there is not any weight of experience, but hearsay."
4,Babaji and the 18 Siddha Kriya Yoga Tradition,"Marshall Govindan writes with insight and intelligence on the history of the Siddhas. It is, therefore, very difficult to understand the motivation behind some of the scathing reviews on this page - perhaps it is a matter of Govindan having offended the fundamentalist Christian mindset by delving into the topic of immortality; although one wonders why such people would even pick up a book like this one. I would have liked to see more information on Babaji himself, as the current offering is rather sketchy. Nevertheless, the book is well-researched and illuminated by Govindan's gentle style. It is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in following the paths of the Siddhas, particularly the ones who have allegedly transformed the physical body into an immortal vehicle, transcending ageing and death. Govindan also gives us a concise and well-organized overview of Kriya Yoga making this book an excellent introduction to the topic."
4,Angus Artwork,"Wholeheartedly agree with the previous review. Too ambitious to catalog so many culturally different peoples over so long a period of time. Would've been better to concentrate on one or two at the most. However, the fabulous artwork is worth the small sum of the book's price."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book when I was about a month pregnant and I haven't been able to use it once. It's not written in an organized manner, the diets they suggest are too hard to follow and unrealistic for the average working woman. I was also looking for a month by month suggestion of what to eat or even by trimester and this book didn't have it. It's too complicated. I was better off just asking my doctor."
1,Waste of time & money,"I could not have been more disappointed in this stupid stupid book. I purchased it during my first trimester and could not believe how worthless it was. Essentially, the book's mantra is ""follow the food pyramid."" What to eat in the second trimester? ""Follow the food pyramid!"" What to eat post-partum? ""Follow the food pyramid!"" They could have simply printed a one-sentence flashcard rather than a book. The book lacked detail and cohesion. It was poorly written and simply annoying. Any single issue of any pregnancy magazine can give you every bit of information offered in this useless book."
1,every bit of info available for free from Goverment agency,"This book is a rip off every bit of information is available free of charge from Goverment Agencys, Elected Officials, Public Librarys. And here on the Internet. And Most of what is discussed Has Eligibility requirements Such as being a veteran, Low Income, Disabled, etc."
1,I was very disappointed with this book !,"This book was bogus ! The commercial I saw on tv, with the author, who looks like a clown, said that this book contained valuable free things. It is nothing more than a listing of government programs that are very hard to get and have very little to do with free things."
1,I am quoted in this book without permission,"I have received several calls from senior citizens who have read this book and want to know how they can rent their homes out to filmmakers.....although I do not mind bearing witness to the possibility of using ones home for use in motion pictures, I find it troubling that the author uses me as a reference without proper permission. Given this information, I can only suggest that seniors be ""smart consumers"" and decide for themselves if this author's work merits serious consideration."
1,Overpriced Rot,"Really bad especially in color...save your money, unless you are a really diehard old movie fan. I do mean diehard. Get The Bishop's Wife instead with your money"
5,Good and Funny!,"The is a good and funny film! And the colorization makes it even better -- look at the green of Jimmy's green and black Christmas sportcoat! The story is great, too. One man stuffs his money in a hole, the other man puts it to use in the community and is rewarded many-fold -- a modern retelling of the parable of the Talents? It is great to see Jimmy singing and playing the piano. The movie is also a love story, revolving around the daughter (played by Terry Moore). Love it!"
5,A Christmas Wish fulfilled,"I got this DVD based on the reviews for it andThe Great Rupert, especially Gomez Addams' review, which highly recommended the B&W; print of the former DVD over the latter. I can't compare the two prints, but I can say the transfer on this DVD is exceptionally clear and vivid. The sound is just fine too. I had downloaded and burned the free copy of The Great Rupert available on archive.org, I think, but it was such a poor copy I just couldn't show it to the kids on Xmas. Fortunately, I hadn't promised it, so when A Christmas Wish came a few days afterwards, they got their treat.About the colorized version I can't comment, having no interest in it. Though I must say one reviewer's comment that the movie should have been made in color is so true. On the other hand, the b&w; print(s) probably survived better than any color ones would have."
3,dvd quick,"The item came fast, but the packaging had water damage. The DVD works fine though. so I am satisfied. A-okay."
5,Pleasant.,"An unemployed, penniless, man, Jimmy Durante, his wife, and daughter struggle to find a place to live and survive at Christmas-time.Pleasant and lively. Personality from penniless, Jimmy Durante who must stay one step ahead of his miser, landlord. The two do some nice singing. Some humor, and a thoughtful moral.You like the people, and the story; a story which is subtly and deceptively heartwarming."
5,Beautifully colorized and restored!,"After watching a cheap unrestored copy of this movie, (under the title ""The Great Rupert""), I wanted a good copy of it. The color is wonderful. It doesn't have the greyish midtones common in colorized movies.This is Jimmy Durante's only starring role in a picture. Terry Moore and Tom Drake costar. Great plot.It also features a wonderful commentary with Terry Moore."
3,Bill M,I really like the story. The only thing wrongwas the Colorado version only played 3/4 thrum then jammed black and white. Was fine all throw way thrum. I sent an email to buyer thrum amazon never got a reply. I was asking if this was a problem all time not worth sending back just thought bad buisness not to answer email.
1,Didn't Emanuelle used to involve mostly eroticism?,"If you want erotica then this isn't the Emanuelle film for you. Yes, there are a couple of so-so love scenes, but the one lesbian scene is pratically non-existent, and the obvious focus of this one is the blood and gore content. I expected more erotic content, and instead got mostly gruesome scenes that I didn't particularly expect. Remember that scene in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"" where a nude Bo Derek was tied up and bathed by native women? That scene was erotic. Nothing like that one this video."
5,Nothing Works Better!,"This stuff is awesome! I've tried a lot of things on my bleached hair, and this conditioner is by far the best out there. It works just like the conditioner that comes with the hair dye kits. After using it, my hair is extremely soft, silky, and tangle free--like it hasn't been color treated at all! I've tried a lot of professional and drug store conditioners and nothing compares. I have fine but thick hair that I must shampoo and condition daily. Feria Color Moisturizing Treatment doesn't leave any build up in my hair (even when used daily). Other than online, the only place I know you can get this is at Sally's Beauty Supply. I give it two thumbs up--definitely worth it!"
5,Koopalings Komic Book,"Mario and the Koopa Kids team up for a hilarious book, in ""Mario Meets the Koopa Kids""! First, it's ""B Kind 2 Tur-dull Day"", as the Princess sends the Koopalings, who were trying to capture her, back to their own castle. Although it sounds like an escape for them, it turns out their father is furious. Not a good thing for the Koopalings. Next Mario and Bowser must work together, trying to escape from a sewer drain. It's too bad Luigi takes all the credit. In another episode, Wendy meets up with Stanley the Talking Fish, and wishes she hadn't. In the final one, Bowser, Mario and Luigi all get caught in a real-life struggle which was supposed to be an acting out of a comic book episode. With Lemmy Koopa dressed up as Toad, this could become trouble for the Marios, but hilarious for the readers. There isn't any other comic book out there that is as funny as this one. A must-buy for Mario and Koopa fans!"
3,MYLO,"At first listen, Mylo's ""Destory Rock & Roll"" seemed like it would be a really good CD. There are some cool, fun, upbeat songs on the disc. There are a handful of stellar songs on here.However, after trying to get through it all, the disc seems to be more of a collection of songs; not so much a cohesive album. It's a nice collection of songs but the songs don't really vibe/ gel together a lot. There's no real underlying theme/ feeling that runs throughout.I think Mylo would work better as a collection of MP3's on a playlist than as an album. I don't think this album will ""destroy rock and roll""; it's just alright - not great."
4,"Fresh, fun...","...and wildly catchy, this, whatever you wanna call it, dance, electronica, etc., disc is full of hooks and glides by quite effortlessly. Great driving music. Yes, not that I care if it gets saved, but Monsieur Mylo just might be the savior of dance music...particular raves go to ""Drop the Pressure"" and ""Destroy Rock N Roll""..."
3,Calligraphy Pens,"I received the pens in a timely manner, but one of the 12 would not work. It had dried out."
4,A Perfect Panoply of American Folk,"Perhaps only a lyricist as talented as Willie Nelson has the vision to select such well-built songs and craft them into a quilt of American Folk. The songs are all beautiful, and run the range of emotion from hope in the face of failure (Heartland) to selfless love (Valentine). Buy it."
5,A great album,"This is one of my favourite Willie albums, although ""Spirit"" still occupies the number one spot. But this album really is fantastic. The songs and the guest musicians are great. Joining Willie are Sinead O'Connor, Bob Dylan, Paul Simon and Bonnie Raitt. The songs range from country, to folk, to pop, to blues, and every one Willie makes his own. He has never sounded better, and this is a must have for all of Willie's fans. The 28 page booklet contains all lyrics and some wonderful photos. Highly recommended."
4,balanced,Willie has picked a balanced selection of relatively recent mainstream rock and roll hits. His use of original artists and their arrangements is original.
3,Willie Nelson not great,"This CD is not up to Willie's best, But I only bought it for one song "" What Was IT You Wanted"" so I got what I Wanted but It would have been good to get a grat CD"
2,Not the best Willie,"This was a disappointment; we always enjoy his CDs, but this was less than stellar."
5,The Best!,"Fuhgetaboudit, this is the real deal when it come to great swinging jazz trombone. These guys have fantastic sounds, great technique and ideas that seem to flow like the fountain of youth! You can hear a ton of the trombone roots that Carl Fontana employed in his storied career in this fantastic, free blowing session. Bill Allred's son, John is one of the best bone players working today, but his old man and Roy Williams really set the bar at the top notch on this one. Enjoy!"
5,awesome,Nat Stone did a beautiful job in bringing readers to experience his rowboat trip. It's a refreshing and inspiring story. A rejuvenating perspective of America from a rowboat. I recommend this book to all my friends.
4,On the Water,"A very nice read, with some memorable metaphors, such as the rowboat moving at the speed of a hand moving stealthily toward the swatting of a mosquito. Strangely, I found such throwaway lines the most diverting. Stone's experiences of the places and people he encounters generally fell a bit short of vivid or gripping or perceptive. And why wouldn't he include Laurent de Brunhoff's sketch of Babar plying the oars? Finally, the nitpicking editor in me asks: ""plebian""? ""miniscule""? Doesn't Broadway Books have a spellchecker?"
1,Doesn't properly fit a cellphone.,"I bought this to use with my Samsung SCHA930 and my wife's LG cell phone so that we could use normal headphones to listen to the built in MP3 players. Unfortunately it did not fit either of our phones. Let me clarify that, the jack did fit, but the plastic around it is so bulky that we could not plug it in all the way so only one side of the headphones would work. The quality of the product itself seemed fine as long as you're buying it for something other than a cell phone mp3 player."
1,Adapter Does Not Fit Properly,The adapter does not look like the picture and its construction does not allow it to fit properly in the mini jack. It was impossible to use because of the shape/fit.The adapter arrived promptly/on schedule.
1,Don't Waste your money,"When you plug it into your phone, it jumps all over the place and constantly makes unwanted phone calls. Couldn't use it for more than 15 seconds. WORST BUY EVER!!!!!!"
1,Did not work,It didn't work. Fortunately it was inexpensive or otherwise I'd try to return it. This sentence is to cross the 20-word threshold.
1,stereo jack to plug adapter,It had the same problem i have had with other adapters just like it. It will only work with one ear on any headphone set and it wont be clear sound.
3,Doesn't Make Full Contact Without a Fight,"I'm trying to use this between a RODE VideoMic and a LUMIX FZ150, but I have to struggle to get the adaptor to make full contact within the camera's mic/remote jack, pushing until the correct icon shows up to indicate the switch from integrated to external microphone. This COULD be because the adaptor shown is not what is sent. The plug in the photo has a fluted plastic cover, narrower at the male end, and the plug actually received is a blocky, thick cover from end to end. On the other hand, it could just be the imprecise nature of the male plug shaft itself -- it may just not fit the contacts inside the camera.So I'm still looking for a plug that will work consistently, without a wrestling match each time."
1,Didn't work,Adapter did not completely pug into unit and wound become disconnected if device move in anyway. Therefore adapter is useless if walking or running. Can not recommend adapter. I did receive adapter promptly.
1,terrible,"First of all, the product that was shipped to my house was not the product in the picture. Next, when i plugged into the phone, only one ear worked. I dont recommend this product to anyone. It was cheap but i would rather spend a little more and get a good value product."
1,Poor quality control,This was the worst adaptor I have ever seen. I was bent and did not work. Buyer beware. Cheap price= cheap product.
2,Not the thing shows in picture!,I got this product on the first day of the delivery date. But I found it was NOT THE SAME thing that shows in the photo from the introduction pages! My purpose was used it for my Bose OE2 headphone but it was barely like the one shows in the photo( so absolutely it does not work with my headphone! )It still can use for something else but I think the seller just told the lie and... That will be the last thing I buy form this seller!
3,Headphone plug.,"This product did no work in stereo, until you plug the headphone in one half the wasy in, then it worked. It still works the same way as when it got delivered to me. Other than that, I don,t know what to say."
2,Nothing like the picture,I received a smaller bulkier item rather than what is pictured it is not lengthy enough for the entire 3.5mm male to fit in the 3.5mm female. Will not buy from seller again...
2,micro to mini adapter,"The adapter works great for replacing the xbox controller connection to the Turtle Beach headset - it is the only one I could find on the web at all. My problem with the product is that the photo was of an adapter /extension cable, but only the adapter was provided. As a result, I needed to use an 1/8"" patch cable to go from the adapter to the headset - worked out in the end, but not what was advertised. Also, they charged me $18 for shipping which was ridiculous!!"
3,ok,It is a little flimsy but it does work. I was able to use it with my mp3 player and other head phones and it did ok.
3,"It's an adapter, it adapts what more can you ask for...","It's an adapter that does what it's supposed to, adapts one size plug to another size plug...and it works...what more can you ask for? Maybe a pair of headphones to go with it!"
2,Does not provide stereo functionality,"for some reason, probably the phone circuits themselves, only monoaural support when connected to a stereo headset. May not be the fault of the product. Tried on Samsung 1760 and LG chocolate"
5,Progressive rock with emotion and intelligence.,"This is the 1st solo outing from the ex-Camel and ex-Happy the Man keyboardist and is one of the finest of the genre. Kit has long been known for his ability to add color and heart to the synthesizer. In this disc, he displays his signature pitch bending and orchestral chording along with a degree of manual dexterity that is startling. Comparisons to Jan Hammer have been made although for my money Kit has far more taste and sublety.Kit plays keyboards, flute, nylon guitar and assorted percusion. He is supported by former Happy the Man drummer Coco Roussell who does a magnificent job of handling the 5/4, 7/4 and other odd timing.A lot of prog rock from the 70's and 80's has a dated sound. This one has remained fresh and interesting for 20 years. Don't miss this one."
3,3.5 Rating- I still Like it,"Listening to this cd / album again after not listening to it for a LONG while really brought back feelings of another time. This is when i was into progressive rock and more melodic/neatly structured music. A nostalgic trip for me but a possible great find for anyone looking for the 'greats' of 70's Prog music. Recommended to anyone interested in the more melodic and harmonic side of those styles (think Camel, Genesis, Happy the Man, etc.)."
2,This is not the indi bagin bin game your looking for,"The game itself runs smoothly but is so boring I couldn't play it for very long. I don't mind the simplistic graphics but the world and color scheme are fairly monotone. A name like Darwinia implies trial and error to evolve the inhabitants but the little Darwinians just bob back and forth. You can build a few units to go blow up the snake vectors and wander around a bit and shoot some more snake things. The ""engineer"" units are automated and when you unselect your combat unit it becomes a very accurate turret. I'm not really needed in this equation other than say go kill over here now. I could live with that, I had a lot of fun withCarnage Heart. The characters in this game are 2d and so is the game."
5,Doris Day Christmas Album,Excellent! A great album to spend a romantic holiday evening with your lover.
5,A wonderful Christmas Collection,"Doris Day never disappoints her fans, she is interpreting the following songs in a brilliant way:1. Silver Bells2. I'll Be Home for Christmas3. Snowfall4. Toyland5. Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!6. Be A Child At Christmas Time7. Winter Wonderland8. The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)9. Christmas Present10. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas11. The Christmas Waltz12. White Christmas13. Deck the Halls with Boughs of Holly [bonus track]14. I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm [bonus track]15. Let No Walls Divide (Overdub Version) [bonus track]Hope you'll enjoy it the same way I do!"
1,some tracks are missing,"THIS ALBUM ORIGANALLY HAD 12 TRACKS,BUT INSTEAD IT HAS 9. AMAZON.CO.UK HAS THE ORIGANAL 12 TRACK ALBUM WITH 3 MORE TRACKS. SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ORIGANAL LP FROM 1964 OR THE ONE FROM AMAZON.CO.UK. DORIS DAY IS GREAT TO LISTEN ANY TIME OF YEAR"
5,Her Best Work,I saw Deborah play live at Northern Arizona University and have heard several of her albums. This is her best work.
2,Texaco is lost forever,"I saw Berle as a guest on Tom Snyder TV interview show probably during 1970's. He complained that to save storage space, some custodian at NBC had thrown out all the kinescopes of his work. All gone."
2,Milton Berle Collection,I was looking for the Texaco Star Theatre shows and was disappointed that they weren't on this collection
4,Harder than ever,"As a long-time Rush fan I couldn't help buying this new record from the canadian trio. Besides, I had just to get ready for the magnificent live happening in Milan and this was the best way. What can I say ? A very hard sound, a return to the original power of the first four albums, aligned with the new and increased musical soundness of the latest work, ""Vapour Trails"".Why 4 stars? Rush music and technic do not really deserve such high (and noisy) effects from the audience:there's a better way of mixing (see other masterpieces like ""Exit Stage Left"" or ""A show of hands"").For Rush maniacs a must; for newcomers a good way to taste what this band was able to do in 30 years and what they can actually do on stage."
3,Please..................,"Another live CD! Come on folks! Lets get something betterthan Vapor Trails! I bought this CD, in such great excitment,even though I knew it was a live CD! I was just about to throw itout my house windows. We have the MOST TALANTED rock band,andfirst the recording is terrible! I can barely hear Geddy and his amazing bass lines. I can sure hear the audience,they WEREpumped! But come on with this live stuff,gee it has been a long time since a live cd! Very disappointing,good line for songs.I have heard like Bruce Hornsby's""Lets make some noise""CDthat must have a 10 piece,its live and clear as a bell. So ifyou are looking for clarity and separation of things,bass,vocals etc.... this is CRAP! and a pure waste of money!Think twice about getting it or listen to it from your friends!MY GOD!! Lets go guys with some talented stuff!! PLEASE!!!"
2,By Different Stages instead!,"I love Rush and expecially live Rush, but this is NOT a good live Rush album. The mix is not very good, Geddys vocals are too far down and there is too much bass. The audience is also way too loud in many places too. Different Stages (from last tour) is MUCH better, and it has most of the same songs anyway. (Please tell my why they did Natural Science again instead of Camera Eye like they were thinking of doing). The only good part of this album is the 2 bonus tracks, Between Sun & Moon and Vital Signs. Both a far better quality then the Rio show, and are great versions.So if you just want a good, recent Rush live album, get Different Stages. If you really want a live concert from the Vapor Trails tour, get one of the many, live DAT recordings via trade. Some have better sound quality then this concert recording!"
4,As good as I expected,"Rush hit their creative peak during the deacade between 1975 and 1985. The band demonstrated its unique brilliance during that decade, and Rush fans expect more today.The sound production quality on this DVD is barely satisfactory (use 2 channel pcm for best sound, not the 5.1 ""audience"" mix). The show is great, the video quality is great, and the documentary is great.To please me, Rush must focus on getting the sound right on their future releases. The poor production on Vapor Trails is a testiment to this. It ruins what is otherwise a great effort. Actually, none of the releases I have heard since Moving Pictures sound good. Use The Camera Eye as a reference point for what a good Rush mix should sound like. Great dynamic range, depth of sound stage, analog warmth. It sounds ""musical"" and not ""in your face digital"". What else can I say, other than I net out as enjoying this DVD, and I can't buy a good lunch and beer for the $20 it cost."
2,Disappointment,"I picked RiR up on the spur of the moment. I haven't been a major fan of Rush for a few years, but a live album is always entertaining. And, usually Rush live albums aren't too bad.Well, this one definitely is bad.This is easily the worst mix on a live CD I've heard in several years. Vocals virtually disappear; the drums frequently sound unbelievably thin. It sounds like a midrange quality audience bootleg.Which is a disappointment, because their live albums are usually pretty good best-ofs with some extra oomph and excitement. This album lacks any of the subtleties of previous live Rush recordings, and words can't express how bad the mix is.If you want a recent live disc, get Different Stages instead.(the CD-only tracks sound a bit better than the bulk of the CD but are pretty thin sounding.)"
1,There are much better Rush CDs,The audio mix on this CD makes it difficult to enjoy.The Rush signatures of strong vocals and clean bass lines are missing from this CD.The mix on the vocals is much lower volume than the original records so it sounds like they were picked up by a mic in the drum set and the bass lines are dulled.The constant crowd noise is irritating.The one good thing is that the drum mix is rather good when you can hear it over the crowd noise and Neil Pert is more precise than a drum machine.This CD may sound better on a premium sound system with very fine controls.
3,"Good song list, Not so good song sound","Even after reading all of the reviews talking about how so-so the sound was I decided to buy the cd anyway. It took me a while to decide how to really describe the quality of the album, so here goes. It sounds like your friend went to a Rush concert and had pretty good seats close to the stage. During the concert he calls you on a cell phone to let you hear what it sounds like to be there. Put that on a cd and you have it. You can kind of understand the lyrics on some of the tracks when the crowd is singing along. Otherwise, it is a lot drums, guitars, crowd cheering, and an occasionally audible singer."
5,What a RUSH.. no pun intended...,"This was a great show and to have a snapshot I wonderful. For any and all RUSH fans, I would recommend this CD. It is really good. I suggest taking a look at the DVD as well."
3,"Performance good, sound quality bad, hence 3 stars","I went to the theatre and saw the show first hand on a big screen but the sound was just terrible. It really pissed me off. I couldn't hear the drums at all. Credits are given that Lifeson aided in the mixing and the guitars are definately out front on this one. I was looking foward to another ""Show of hands"" only better - due to increasingly sophisticated technology - but this is a sore disappointment over all - simply because the songs are inspired but the recording leaves much to be desired... Grrrr!"
1,I WISH I would have read these reviews first!,HORRIBLE sound. I came here to see if it was just me or my equipment. This sounds worse than some bootlegs I've heard! All the Worlds a Stage was recorded in 70what?? This is now the 21st century and that 70's live album sounds FAR superior. What a waste of $25. Good setlist.. if you could hear it over the crowd.. and terrible mixing!
2,Gotta agree; the sound is underwhelming,"First off, this is a fine performance of the Canadian rock trio on their first tour in many years. As well, you get just about every Rush song you'd ever want in a live setting. BUT, what was guitarist Alex Lifeson thinking (or hearing) when he helped mix this thing? Singer/bassist Geddy Lee's vocals are so deeply buried that I found myself straining to hear them on almost every song. After awhile, this became so frustrating I stopped listening to the album and have traded it in at a used record store. For a far, far better listening experience, pick up the R30 DVD/CD concert package celebrating the band's 30-year anniversary."
1,Rushing Along The Amazon,"Rush is one band whose music and lyrics are always superb. Imagine my disappointment when I heard the indifferent sound quality and non-existent mastering. It falls prey to the thing live concerts always do: the giant purple monster: the audience. If those Brazilians had just put a sock in it, maybe we just might have something. I cannot see that in an age of digital recording/mastering that this collection of noise could be seriously released as a high priced album. And I know such live albums has successfully been done: Genesis Seconds Out (1977), U2 Under A Blood Red Sky (1983), Simple Minds Live In The City Of Lights (1990), and your pick of Pink Floyd performances. If these live concerts can sound good with primitive caveman equipment, I wonder what happened. I know: it's the Brazilians that happened. I am sorry I have write such review concerning RUSH, but, if you cannot enjoy something with such price tag, then buyers beware."
2,Sounds like a Rush Job...,"Sorry. couldn't resist. It's true though. As one who has almost all the Rush vinyl (including rush through time)and both the early live LPs, I was really disappointed by sound quality. I mean, I have boots (black forest comes to mind) that sound 10x better than this.Guys gotta keep it sharp in their old age."
1,Buy if you like a DVD of people screaming !!!,"O.K, I read all the reviews and bought it anyway. Bad choice ! The sound IS BAD, and I mean BAD. The mix sounds like one mic for the band, and several hundred for the crowd. I have many LIVE concerts (tape,DVD,etc.)but this one rates at the bottom. I'm sure the boys sound great but you can't tell... Exit Stage Left, done over 20 yrs ago, blows this one away for sound quality. If you want crowd noise go to an NFL game, or buy this DVD. It's about the same. As a RUSH fan of over 20 years, what a let down."
2,performance=amazing / sound quality = horrible,"this is rush at the top of their game, performance wise.no way to refute that. but the mix is very muddy and the vocals are frequently burried beneath the mud. overall, it's hard to get past the sound quality. this should have been offered as a free download from their website, or at least advertised as more of a bootleg. for twenty five bucks, i'd like something of much higher fidelity. so many of these rush fans have bought stacks of rush cds and paid top dollar for concert tickets, how about putting in the effort fora top shelf live recording?"
1,Good Setlist . Horrible Mix,The setlist and the music execution of this album is great. However the sound quality is awful. This sounds like an amatuer bootleg recorded with beginner's equipment. I find it hard to beleive that an ablum of this quality made it out of the QA department.
2,PATHETIC,"I started out, years ago, with ""2112"" & ""Moving Pictures"". I had some other stuff, & thought their metal-sounding stuff was o.k., but as they grew more progressive & techno, it just wasn't my bag. Then, when they came to New Orleans for ""Hold Your Fire"", someone told me that, if I didn't see Rush at least once, I'd regret it. Well, I went, & was blown away! The key to appreciating Rush is to get the FULL live experience, & that ESPECIALLY included SOUND! If you missed 'em, & figure you can at least hear it, DON'T START HERE! This is PATHETIC!, & I never though I'd live to say that about a Rush recording! I've heard bootlegs that sounded better than this! It's very Guitar/feedback heavy, the crowd drowns out Geddy's vocals, & you can hardly recognize what song's being played! I'm giving this 2 stars because it does sound like a good show. You just can't HEAR it! Hopefully the d.v.d. will be better!"
2,Long-time fan that is disappointed by the mix,"This is easily the worst-sounding live album from Rush ever; it's even worse than the antiquated All The World's A Stage. Rush definitely are still in fine form performance-wise, but the audio mix on this recording is horribly muddled and the crowd's screaming on top of it just makes it worse. This is truly a shame given the poor audio mix evident as well on their last studio album, Vapor Trails, an album which contains some of the best music Rush has produced in ten years or more. I get the feeling that the guys mixing the album (which I think included Alex Lifeson) did the best they could with what they had, but in the end it is very disappointing. I have no doubt that long-time fans like myself will buy this album and its associated DVD anyway, as they still provide at least one session's worth of enjoyment, and the DVD of course provides a rare look at Rush ""behind-the-scenes,"" something which fans have never really gotten before."
2,Who erased all the bad reviews of this album,"I guess Amazon.com only puts reviews up if they are positive. I wrote a negative review of this album yesterday, just after I bought it and it never showed up. And all the other negative reviews are now gone. Where are they Amazon?Maybe someone should report you guys to the BBB."
2,Actually benefits from some EQ tweaking,Um but ISN'T THAT THE JOB OF THE ENGINEER?!?!Insane performance. Insane Brazilians. What else can you expect?
3,Rush in Rio needs a major Redo,"The last reviewer wrote a review back in 2003, and I'm writing this now in the hopes that the audio on this CD can be remixed to be as good as the audio on the DVD.Oddly enough their new CD Snakes and Arrows is mixed just as badly as this one is. If you like your music muddy, crowded, and sounding musically claustrophopic and dreadful, then buy this CD and Snakes and Arrows.Rush is one of the best progressive bands ever to make music and it is a disservice to not be able to hear the music clearly. A remix/remaster as soon as possible will reinvigorate this CD. I don't know what they were thinking when they mixed and mastered these discs for release in 2003, but make this right, now."
1,Worst live Rush recording EVER!!,"Unbelievably bad. The DVD sounds even worse, as it is more compressed. I still can't believe Rush even agreed to release this garbage. Their audio standards are usually quite high. The person in charge of this mix should NEVER be let inside a studio again. EVER. I want my money back."
2,confused!,"When I bought this item, I though that it was going to be a DVD, however, when I played it, it was only a CD. I do love the music but, it was not what I was looking for. Is there a DVD available on ""RUSH IN RIO""? If so, I would really be interested. Thank you!"
4,Vive le Rush!,"Yeah the sound might be better but it's not unlistenable (I'm no audiophile, I just know what I like - RUSH). Frankly I don't consider the audience ""noise"" a bug, it's a feature. I do miss Red Barchetta and the bulk of 2112, but the balance of the setlist remains true dynamite. If you like the guys - and who doesn't? - you'll find something to like in this recording."
1,"GREAT BAND, UNFORGIVABLY AWFUL SOUND!","Atrocious recording of what should have been a stellar representation of Rush's triumphant return in 2002. People are not exaggerating when they say this is a horrible recording. I love this band dearly but can't bring myself to listen to this album after many attempts at trying to get into it. It literally hurts my ears. The band actually listened to all the complaints about Rush in Rio and R30 (their next live recording release) is miles improved with Richard Chycki at the helm. Skip this one and wait for Snakes and Arrows Live 2007, which comes out in April 2008."
1,"great band, awful sound ..... why?","gret track list, nice packaging, good price, great band .... horrible sound! why must someone buy hi-fi equipment to have such a terrible noise! Avoid this cd, much better all others Rush live cd ...."
1,Super set-list..... Worst cd that I bought last year,"Don't even think about buying this cd. The sound on this cd is the worst that I have ever heard. The whole time you can hear, what seems like 5,000,000 Brazillians, hooting and hollaring. Normaly crowd noise is welcome on a live cd, but they overpower the music. Save your money. Don't say I didn't warn you!!!"
4,Pretty raw sound,"The 3 discs here offer about the same material as the last live album. A tour of South America was well over due and it shows. This was the final stop on the tour. Some prefer just studio albums, as I do. But I will listen to it occasionally."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Buyer beware! This 3-cd set has the absolute worst sound I have ever heard on a live recording. The fact that this was recorded during the 2002 tour makes it inexplicable. Geddy Lee's vocals are almost completely buried. Alex's guitar sounds like it is coming out of a 15-watt amplifier. Neil's drums are totally bass-heavy, and the crowd noise is obtrusive to the point of being a real distraction.On the other hand, the DVD's sound is excellent. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they released this cd set; they have done so much better in the past."
4,Sounds good to me.....,"I'm disappointed to see all the comments on the sound mix on this one. I've been into Rush since 1974 and have seen them about 8 times. This CD sounds just about like being at one of thier concerts (I would agree that the Rio audience is particularly interactive). Nobody should be buying a LIVE CD expecting anything close to studio sound quality- the ones that do sound really clear have been substantially ""cleaned up"". Anyway, I think this is their best live CD with the exception of All The World's A Stage and that was from the 70s. Any Rush fan should appreciate that they are still together and as vital and powerful a band as ever. Rock On."
3,Really bad audio,"I'm sorry but the audio is just terrible and poorly mixed. This sounds like an audience bootleg, from the LAST row. The band is pretty much mono and buried in constant audience noise. The drums aren't clear enough and everything is kind of muddled together. Such a shame for an amazing concert and set list.What is frustrating is knowing that the actual music would have been recorded straight off the mixing board and would be very clear (just like ESL, SOH, or Different Stages), yet in post-production someone decided to mix in tons of audience noise to ruin an amazing recording. This has nothing to do with having no sound check, older on-site recording equipment, etc. None of that would have added so much audience noise on top of the board mix. That's purely a post-production decision.Disappointing for such an amazingly talented band."
1,this totally bites,this sounds like it was recored with a dictaphone. I really am having trouble believing that this album was released. it is really really really horrible
2,"What? Geddy, I can't hear you!","I have been a devoted Rush fan since Signals (1984). Almost 20 years! Other than the long awaited Vapor Trails, I don't believe I have anticipated a new Rush album like Rush in Rio. I was very excited to finally see that it was coming out. What a disappointment! The song selections are great, but the SOUND is horrible! It is hard to understand that they would release something as inadequate as this...they may have not had a choice? They should have prepared for this? Not just some guy in a truck. Better luck next time....We Rush fans hope."
2,"Good selection of tunes, Lousy distorted mix :(","Good selection of tunes, Lousy distorted mix :(the audience is loud as the band and ALL is DISTORTED.Before you buy this cd look for a demo and listen for yourself.But Rush are playing they're asses off, Musically they still have it, geddy's voice is still there, man he can sing/scream still."
2,songs are great. sound quality is terrible,Rush has great songs (at least their older stuff) but it seems like all their live albums are recorded with a mic in the crowd. They need to put out a professionly recorded live album that doesn't sound so muddied.
5,Amazing,"Arguably the best live Rush album ever. Complete live versions of YYZ, Natural Science, La Vila Stangiato, and By-Tor and the Snow Dog. What more could you ask for? How bout scorching versions of One Little Victory, Driven, The Trees, Spirit of Radio, and Working Man. This is possibly the most complete live Rush album."
2,Is that Rush playing in the background?,"I've been a Rush fan for many years and am biased to like anything they do. This CD, however, is unlistenable and a huge disappointment. The crowd noise throughout overpowers the music. I give it two stars only because the set list is great.If you enjoy listening to live music on a subway platform with a train approaching, or if you think the problem with most live records is that it's too damn easy to hear the musicians, you might enjoy the acoustics of this release. Otherwise, you will indeed be disappointed -- despite your best intentions to convince yourself otherwise."
4,4 Stars Based solely on the sound quality...,"....the actual content and performance garners 5+ stars from me. But the sound is pretty crappy. Surprised they didn't master it better. This is especially evident when you listen to the bonus tracks that were taken from another R30 tour show. Both shows were soundboard sourced, but the bonus tracks sound WAY better. That being said, this is a great, great set with amazing performances and a fantastic set list. I won't go over it because if you went to any of the R30 shows, it's basically the same set. All in all, a great live set (3 CDs of live Rush, how can you go wrong?) and it totally bucks the trend of 4 studio released and then a live one (coming only 2 albums after Test For Echo)."
4,Text examines media in 21st century West Africa,"Journalists and communication researchers visiting West Africa or Cameroon will find this book useful. I highly recommend it for everyone interested in an insider's view of a key region of Africa at the beginning of the 21st century. According to Festus Eribo and Enoh Tanjong, co-editors of Journalism and Mass Communication in Africa: Cameroon, its primary purpose is to examine the development of the mass communication system in Cameroon. I believe they successfully accomplish this task with room to spare, examining major shortcomings and strengths of this system. As an African-American journalist and communication professor focused on African and Asian mass communication systems, I was pleased to find that the book was primarily focusing on Cameroon rather than the usual markers; Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Kenya. I found the information in this book up-to-date and filling an important scholarly void."
3,Reiew of Shiloh 2- Shiloh Season,This was purchased as a Christmas gift so it hasn't been viewed as yet (hence the neutral star rating) but I was very pleased with the rapid delivery and ease of purchase. I have no reason to anticipate that the DVD will not be of excellent quality and that the child for whom it was purchased will enjoy it.
3,DEJA VU DOG STORY,"It's heart is in the right place and the message that we must be kind even to those who won't reciprocate is admirable, but SHILOH 2 is merely a retread of the first movie, and nothing really new or truly exciting happens.Zachary Browne takes over the role of Marty and he does a nice job. Michael Moriarty (who acts like he's having trouble moving) and Ann Dowd return as his parents; Scott Wilson returns as nasty Judd, who wants Shiloh back and who is as unlikeable as ever; and Rod Steiger and Bonnie Bartlett reprise their roles of the doctor and his wife.I respect a movie that puts family values and doing the right thing, but as a movie, it's only mildly diverting for adults, but let the kids watch it and see a movie where rap music is unheard of."
4,shilo 2 season,I read the book shilo because I thought it would be a good book. And I was right it was a very good book. It was a very exiting book. I especially like the part were Shilo cmes to Marti. I like this book because I like animals. It made me kind of sad when Jud tried to hurt Shilo. I look forward to reading more Shilo books.
5,Very Good Movie,"If like a good movie, if like watching something with a plot, if you liked the first Shiloh, then this movie is a must-see. I just watched this movie the other day after renting it and this is literally the best movie I've seen all year. I don't care what age you are, you will definately enjoy this movie. I do recommend watching the first Shiloh though, because that way you'll understand the sequel a lot better. This is an excellent movie, a great ending, great actors/actresses, and is something worth seeing on a good night."
4,Good family movie,My 5 year old daughter loves this movie and it's nice to finally see a movie where right is right and wrong is wrong. Marty learns about injustice and how to live with being wrongly accused. He also learns how to forgive and show compassion. This is a very good family movie that can spark some interesting discussion about morals and values.
4,airtex electric fuel pump,"its a great fuel pump and it was sent on time,the price was the same as at any auto store but it want set in the carrage to fit my jeeep,I;ll keep it in casted."
4,Good book for medically-based chiropractors.,"Written by DC's and PhD's at National College of Chiropractic. Red ruled sections give relevant clinical information, which is nice, and chapter 11 (pain of spinal origin)is very helpful, but it can sometimes read like stereo instructions."
5,My uncle!,"I may have a bias opinion since i've been hearing about him for years but this is actually a good cd. If Deon would of had a better manager he would have been a superstar, my personal superstar! But now he deserves to shine with this cd even if it's 40 years old!"
3,Nice mid 60's soul music,"The title cut is wonderful. The rest of the album is only so-so. Nothing horrendous, but nothing stands out either. A few re-makes of hits better known by other artists. Great voice, mediocre material."
5,Love Makes the World Go Round,"This CD left me with very great memories. I played the CD for my friends, we went back in time. We talked for hours about the good times. buy it."
3,One Hit Wonder,"I purchased this cd for one tune because I love it. That's exactly what I got, one tune. The rest of the cd is okay but I was hoping for more. If you like the artist, purchase the cd; if not, find a mixed cd with this tune on it."
2,I have read better . . .,"I am a very avid spiritual reader. THis is a book of daily meditations, but they don't really ""speak to my heart and soul"" as many others I have read. I will continue to read it nightly, along with my other spiritual works, because I don't buy a book just to toss it. I'll continue to give it a chance. Maybe there will be more ""meat"" for thought as I progress through it. It's okay, but I really wouldn't recommend it."
2,"confusion, eternal confusion","Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book. I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so. This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined. Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts. Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired."
4,As good a casebook as you can reasonably hope for,"Not only is Dukeminier & Krier's ""Property"" well-written and interesting, it features something very unusual for a law school casebook: pictures! There is something very heartwarming about a casebook that includes pictures related to the cases, such as: a diagram of a 19th century duck decoy, portraits of Justice Louis D. Brandeis and King Henry VIII, and ""Seaweed,"" by Georgia O'Keefe. A very enjoyable read."
2,Out of date,This book was a lot cheaper than the one required for law school so I got it but a newer edition came out and it was way different with a huge amount of updates. I ended up having to make zerox copies from a classmate's book. I could only use this for some of the legacy cases.
3,Decent but somewhat lacking,"This book is easily one of the more interesting of the first year textbooks, however it has some flaws. The cases are not all that plentiful and many of those in the RAP section are so incredibly convoluted they serve little purpose to a first year trying to learn the ropes. Examples of wording for the various present and future interests are few and far between and more problems for this very mechanical area would be extremely helpful. However the book has its strong points. The history of property interests is well done although not very useful, and the adverse possession, co-ownership and marital interests, and acquisition by find sections are excellent."
2,Kinda Lousy,"This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned.LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates.LOUSY for learning mortgages.LOUSY for learning adverse possession.Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy.Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written.Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic.I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book."
3,Not bad...,"This is probably one of the easier to understand case books I have read. It is incredibly dull, but it covers all the concepts well and includes some useful graphics (as well as some pointless ones). It's certainly worth its cost."
2,Not one of my favorite property books.,Property requires a lot of history and background. I personally do not believe this book does the best job of introducing the historical aspect of property law.
3,I do not sure a high opinion of this book,"I do not share the opinion of the other reviewers. I am not a fan of Aspen publishers and the casebooks they produce. Very often the black letter law and majority views are contained solely in the notes following cases that represent bad decisions and minority views. There is no question that Dukeminier is an excellent authority on property law, but often the authors add unrelevant comments and failed attempts at humor. I would not say this is a good casebook in regard to functionability, but I do agree that the reading was easy and enjoyable at times."
5,Book in Great Condition,"Book was listed as acceptable, but it was actually in very great condition. Very little highlighting, etc. Thanks."
1,property book,The book was lost in the mail and I had to buy a new one from the bookstore here. I was then sent a replacement book which I had to return to Amazon.
5,Leonardo the Titanic babe!,At last a the biography of Leonardo!!! Not only does it have cool pics but i know heaps more about Leo. I would love to meet Leo but i know that's impossible. At least i feel closer to him by this book!
5,i really liked this site i love leonardo!! he is hot!!,i really liked this site!!! leonardo is the hottest guy i know!!well i dont know him but i wish i could meet him sometime!!but i love his pictures! i have a wall with all his picture brandy knapp
2,Not worth it.,"Although this is a good book for slavering preadolescent female fans who don't understand words more than two syllables in length, the book was unsatisfactory for anyone but the most devoted. Containing quotes, pictures and a short bio, get this one for your daughter only if you want to waste your money."
5,"Very good book and pictures, interesting facts. Buy it now!","Not only because of the pictures it has but because of all the rest, this book is really one of the best on leo, believe me, I have read them all. Buy it fast!"
1,Wack!!!!,"Throw this back on the shelf, and never listen to it again. This cd doensn't offer anything new, and the tracks are tired. Lyrically they do have promise, but they don't mesh well together. The production is weak, and needs lots of work. In order for this group to last, they need lots of work. Give us something different. Don't waste your time buying this wack album. Whoever produce this, must not listen to hip-hop music...at least in this decade. Overall....disappointment."
5,"THE SOURCE NEEDS TO GIVE ""BULLET PROOF SOUL"" FIVE MICS!!!","I HAVE NEVER LISTENED TO A RECORD THAT I LIKE FROM BEGINNING TO END. EACH TRACK IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. THE FIRST SONG GHOST IN THE SHELL IS JUST THE BOMBEST LAID BACK EAST-COAST TRACK I EVER HEARD. THEN THAT DIRTY SOUTH TRACK CALL ""PUSH IT UP"" WAS TOTALLY ILL. I HAD A FRIEND THAT GOT KILLED AND THE SONG ENTITLED ""SAY A PRAYER FOR ME"" JUST EASES MY MIND WHEN I LISTEN TO IT. AND THE SONG ""BETTER DAYS"" IS A WINNER. I HOPE RADIO PLAYS THIS ALBUM BECAUSE THE DOPEST AS RADIO SMASH SINGLES OFF THIS ALBUM WOULD BE: HATAS IN THA CLUB, ILL STREET BLUES, THUGS NEED LOVE TOO"" SAY A PRAYER FOR ME, PUMP SONG, PUSH IT UP AND BETTER DAYS. I REALLY AND TRULLY LOVE THIS ALBUM AND IT WILL BE IN MY CD CHANGER FOR SOME YEARS TO COME. I TIP MY HAT OF TO ""MAFISTO"" THE PRODUCER ON THE RECORD WHO PRODUCED THIS RECORD. MUCH LOVE"
5,NEVER HEARD A RECORD THAT CAN MAKE ALL COAST BOUNCE,"Soul 20/20 Entertainment Group was passing out promotional copies of the album at Hadley Park. We popped it in to get a great laugh. This record CRACKED OUR FACES. Instead of laughing we were bouncing in the park to the pump song, push it up, Mi vida loco get'em and we were feeling the lyrical content of every song especially MISERY. Ill Street Blues and Say a Prayer for me, and Ghost in a Shell are most my favorites. I have listened to many albums but and I can only name one Hip-Hop Rapp record that I liked every song and that was the Chronic, Dr. Dre, Death Row. Bullet Proof Soul will always have a slot in my CD Changer. The beats on this album is to much. Being from Nashville, I must say that this Soul 20/20 Entertainment Group and Bullet Proof SOul are representing Nashville, TN to the maximum. I got a free copy but I'm going to buy one."
5,Excellent and fast service!,"A++++ seller! Arrived extremely fast and in new condition as promised, particularly pleased of the quickness of the delivery, arriving in a timely fashion for a birthday gift. I would definitely buy from again and highly recommend this seller! ('^__~*')"
1,Item parts did not fit--returned,"This item when easily assembled did not fit, i.e., the 'oven' did not fit into the glass top hole. I called the factory customer service and they suggest that I return it as the parts were not fitting properly.I don't like paying and waiting, then having to return it before I get a chance to use it. I went to Sears and bought one with a self starting timer."
2,One of my bad purchases!!!,It will not cook a whole chicken in 20 minutes..more like l hour and 45 minutes.I tried a small roast and it could not be eaten. Save your money and use your real oven for a good chicken and a good roast.
2,"Broken handle, doesn't work","I was happy with this cooker while it lasted, which wasn't long. Without using it much, the handle which is also the start switch broke. I tried duct taping it to make it work, but no go. I looked up the parts replacement price but do I want to throw $65 good money after bad? Makes more sense to get another cooker without this design flaw."
2,Great Oven BUT the handle broke,I love this oven. Used one years ago. My brother has an older one and I had to bypass the safety switch for him. I bought a new one and the handle broke after 6 uses. I love the way they cook but the manufacturer definitely should address the problem with their safety interlock system. It is great for healthy cooking all the grease leaves the food and it is crispy outside but juicy inside. It makes great french fries and veggies also. Good oven if it would just stay together.
5,Great product!,"I really love my convection oven, it takes up little counter space and my foods comes out tasty, golden brown, juicy and its a healthier way of cooking."
2,aroma is not doing proper business,This product was defective but could not do anything cause I was leaving the states when I received it. When I plugged it in the propeller made a weird noise and then stopped working. I discovered that a screw holding the propeller was missing. Also the cover was hit on top. I tried directly to talk to Aroma to ask for an add on for the product but no response even after 2 and a half months now. I am very sorry that I bought this product in such a bad condition and could not return it. Aroma company is not doing good business.
2,Disapointment,"The oven cooked well enough, but it's durability has problems. The handle/connector, after months of use, broke. Also, to really clean the lid and fan mechanism properly, it needs to be disassembled with a screwdriver and small socket. To use it, which I do, I keep a role of duct tape near by to tape the handle/connector down, which where it must be to function. I do like the main body being made of tempered glass. Note: I purchased it from another website at a much higher price. addendum: After nine months to a year the product no longer functioned properly or predictably. I no longer have a use for it. Great concept, terrible execution; I've junked it. Burnt once, shame on you; burnt twice, shame on me. There will be no second burn. (zip star rating)"
4,cooks well,The oven cooks well. I fount that when just using the lowest degree of heat there are no worries about under cooked or over cooked meals. The handle leaves you with some concerns. The handle is used to pick up the heating unit which is the lid and it starts the cooking process once snapped down in its place. The handle can snap apart in it middle. I do recommend it because it does cook well.
3,"noisy,white dials instead of red and made in china??","I've got my aroma but it is little different than I thought.First of all, my timer and temperature dial is white color instead ofred. Second of all my friend's aroma oven is ""made in USA"" instead of ""made in China"". Also, when I use my aroma oven I hear whooooooooooooooooooooong~~~ sound and tick tok tick tok timer sound constantly(which is bearable). But this constant tak tak tak tak tak~~ sound is so annoying. It gets more noisy sometimes, so I'm wondering if it's my particular aroma oven or is it normally this noisy. I do not have any questions about its efficency,but the noise level is a big minus. Does anyone have noise problem with your aroma oven? If it's just mine, I would return this and get a new one. Without the noise problem I would give 5 star plus!!"
3,Great band without good singers,"I have followed Irakere since its very beginning, and I have always been impressed by the great quality of their musicians. Regardless of how good their recordings may have been, there is no comparison with listening to them live.However, my opinion is that their weakness has only been the lack of good vocalists. In this record, this is quite identifiable. While the female singer is OK, listening to the male singers is quite a challenge.Because of the nature of boleros, Irakere cannot show off here their great talent as musicians."
5,"terrific frame that will last for years and years, thanks to Target","I have had this frame for over 6 years and thought that it was an exceptional item because it looked great and was at a low price. I purchased the original frame from my local Target store. This frame is manufactured by Target and the correct/actual measurements are 12.5 X 12.5. The color is a fashionable black that matched everything and blends in with all types of decors. Recently I had to get another frame and that's when I purchased this from Target online. I know it will last for years and years, just like the first one. I also commend Target for being so efficient. My order was placed on a Saturday afternoon and it arrived by Tues. morning. And keep in mind that the frame can be used to hold other things besides LP's (I do not use mine to hold records)."
4,Letters of a Bygone Age,"The letters of Max Perkins and Marjorie Rawlings reveal Perkins genius as an editor more than anygenius of Rawlings as an author. Perkins always knew what to say and when to say it. Rawlings didn't.She did have a topic, however, that was great interest to Perkins, the poverty stricken people of theFlorida scrub. After guiding Rawlings in her vastly underrated and largely forgotten first novel, SOUTHMOON UNDER, Perkins continually urged her to write what would become THE YEARLING. It was his idea towrite a Huck Finn novel out of the scrub, and eventually Rawlings agreed. Still, it was her giftednesswith language that made THE YEARLING both the cultural phenomena that it was."
1,False Advertising,"The dvd information claimsLanguage: French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanishbut there is only English and Japanese with English subtitles. If you are going to claim 5 languages I expect 5 languages."
2,could be better,"this is the best anime in the history, but in the american version, it has too many changes.The spanish and japannes versions were great.The american version contain other soundtrack instead of the original, its also edited and the name of the characters has been changed.they have no respect to the work of the genius masami kurumada, a real tragedy."
2,Very good,"This DVD is uncensored and un cut, its different thant the Knights of the Zodiac version been shown on TV (Cartoon Network). This has its original Sound Track, and different translation that is correct.This is a nice DVD to buy if you are a Saint Seiya FAN."
4,St. Seiya Original Language,"The original japanese version is provided intact and uncut on this DVD (including opening, closing and eyecatches between commercial breaks).My only problem is with some of the translations, they seem to avoid literal translations, but it does not seriously hinder the overall experience. I tried to watch about 30 seconds of the english language version then stopped because I didn't like it at all. I got this really cheap too, so I can't complain at all."
5,there is a collection box?,"Somedoy knows what is the best collection box for Saint-Seiya?I see there is ""collector edition"", and the volume 5 with ""box"".What does that mean? If i buy the first 6 volumes, I will have all the first episodes? Or, as a fan, i'm loosing the oportunity to have some more?"
3,"Good, but not Excellent- 3.5 stars","An engaging, even compelling read; BUT I think Haeger is an inexperienced writer. Her flow in telling a story is not quite smooth; there are some choppy sentences. For example, one of the ladies at court is described on one page as having an ""irritatingly high"" voice. Half a page later, the same phrase is used again to describe the same woman's voice. The Declaration of Indulgence, which was, in fact, an act Charles II passed to lessen the persecution of Catholics, is twice described, word for word, as ""an act intended to protect his Catholic family and friends."" This sort of repetition was not frequent, but, often, when describing some of the relationships at court, the author would repeat the same thing. ""The Protestant Monmouth"" and ""The Catholic James"" are phrases that grew a bit annoying. etc.A fairly good read, but I was once or twice mildly fed up with Nell's wit and Charles' constant infidelity."
2,Yawn!!,"This book almost put me to sleep. The whole thing is about how ""clever"" and wonderful this woman is, yet the author never gives her anything really clever to say. Everyone loves her because...I could never really tell, but apparently everyone she meets just LOVES her instantly. Boring!! After the 3,000th ""Oh, Nell, you're so clever!"" I couldn't take it anymore."
5,Absolutely incredible,"I knew anything knew by WSP was going to be amazing, but this is even better than I imagined"
2,quality!,This is a breath of fresh air after the over commercialized Bombs and Butterflies. They have gone back to putting on CD what you hear the shows. A definite must for any Panic fan - you won't be disappointed!
4,Outstanding effort and a great new direction,"I've read the previous reviews, and I have to disagree. To call this album their ""sellout"" album would be, putting it mildly, aggressively naive. It falters only on a couple of fronts, but Panic has finally achieved a studio sound discernable from their live shows, which makes this album a refreshing departure from past efforts. Use of the DDBB on Blue Indian, as well as Todd's crooning on You'll Be Fine exhibits a musical coming of age and maturation that I had hoped to see. Combine that with the variety of tunes, the bluegrass ""The Waker"" to the hard driving ""Climb to Safety"", and this album is a winner. Panic has taken the step to expand its bag of tricks used for live performance, and incorporated a creativity which will set them apart as a terrific studio band as well."
5,Widespread Panic at their Best,"Without a doubt the most diverse effort by the boys from Athens G-A. Have heard the whole album and they have truly molded into what we all knew they would. Do not try and put them in any category other than their own. Phish, Blues Traveler, and many others are great---but no substitute for the Panic."
5,Finally a New Album from Panic,"This is a great CD, like all other Panic albums. Every panic album I own simply refuses to go into retirement. The music flows like a waterfall of twangs and crashes, it is frothy like a walruses moustache, yet confrontational like the beasts awesome tusks. It lays there on the beach of your mind and then flounders in the ocean of your spirit. Come hither great musical walrus!"
5,This is still Widespread Panic...please remember this,"please do not refer to WSP as a sellout...how many bands can say that they turned down the rolling stones...very few, i'm sure...and who cares what is being played on the radio-i don't listen to it anymore...i'll leave you now as the medicine takes...enjoy...peace"
