5,Buddy Pack,I love this product so much that I have bought several to give as gifts. It is perfect for the hard to reach places on the back that ache from standing all day at work. I prefer to microwave it for two minutes so not to burn the skin.
4,Very effective,"We have two of these in our house and they are used often. They are very effective at holding moist heat. My only complaint is that the ""rope"" ring is rather rough. Overall, a very good investment."
5,Love this,I have used this for stiff neck and even sore throats. It is even great just to warm up on a cold night.
2,Disappointed : (,"We have used and loved the Bed Buddy for years and have bought around 8 of them. However we bought one this past summer and found that now they have a stitched seam down the middle of it leaving it hard and not as flexible. I have been trying to locate one of the old original without the seam. I saw this one and checked the pictures out carefully from this seller and the picture was of the old original one without the seam. However when I received it is the new one with the seam. I was so disappointed I thought was purchasing what was shown on the picture but was not : (Buyer beware you may not be getting what is pictured.Bed Buddies are better without the seam...more flexible, softer and molds to your body.Thank You"
1,Avoid Original Bed Buddy,"I bought two of these Bed Buddies. I had been using a similar product for years and it worked well. It had just gotten a little stained from use so REGRETTABLY I tossed it out.This product didn't hold up at all. Within a couple of uses, small holes formed and allowed the small stones to eke out. It does't get very hot and if you attempt to get it hot by heating further in microwave, tiny holes will form.Try a different brand, this is a total ripoff."
3,Starts to smell.,"I've had this hot/cold pack for a little over a year now and I use it probably ever-other week. So after approximately 30 uses, it still works. However, it definitely has started to smell. Not in a nasty way - it just smells like cooked rice. Which is kind of funny! Another issue is that the difference between 90 seconds and 105 seconds is kind of extreme. 90 seconds, it is still too cool. 105 seconds, and it's burning hot. I have to use a tea towel so that it doesn't burn my skin."
3,bed buddy,my husband always has cold feet and hands.he loves them we have 3 of them.he wished they would stay warmer longer.
2,"Good, but...",It burned in the microwave after 2 minutes. no directions re how long to heat. Material will eventually tear. Plan on returning it.
4,warm comfort,always the same warm feeling. holds heat for quite awhlie. soft outer material lets you rest well even when its up against your back
4,Good for neck ache relief,The Bed Buddy has helped relieve my neck aches that come up some days after long hours in the office chair. The moist heat is effective in helping your muscles relax.
4,Bed Buddy,"I read a few reviews stating that the product design had changed from the picture with the rings, however, when mine arrived it was exactly as pictured.This is great for using on my neck and shoulders, however my one complaint is that there's a faint...smell to it. I'm assuming it's just ""rice in the microwave"" smell, though with all the other scented items Bed Buddy has out, I'd hope that they'll eventually consider scenting the neck wrap as well."
4,"Bed buddy, indeed.","My shoulders have a tendency to ache from long hours spent typing, and so I use a pair of these, heated in the microwave and draped one over each shoulder, to try to relax sore muscles. It would be very easy to overheat these -- I heat two of them for about three minutes, and that's plenty. My largest complaints with these is that the heat dissipates quickly unless they're covered by something (I recommend a towel, or using 'em under a blanket) and that they are lumpy and semi-solid, which is a gripe I have with this entire style of hot packs. I have not used this as a cold pack, and honestly, I probably wouldn't... a bag of frozen peas would curve around an injury a bit better than this would, although these do great for my shoulders."
3,it's just a bag with rice,"It heats up nice - but it's just a cloth bag filled with rice, I'm sure you could make one yourself. Plus, since rice absorbs moisture, after you heat it gets slightly damp which I don't like. Also - it smells like rice! Mine got scorched eventually."
3,Bed Buddy,I bought this as a gift and so I can't really comment on the quality of the product. My mother requested it and she has not complain about the quality. So I guess it is an okay product.
1,This is a really CRAPPY heat/cold pack,"I bought this recently for my injured back. Put in the freezer overnight for use the next morning. Took it out and what? It's hardly even cold. For maybe 2 minutes. Okay, so a couple days later, I now need to use heat. Heat it in the microwave per the instructions, and what? It holds heat for MAYBE 20 minutes. Advertising says longer, but that's bull.Furthermore, on about the 10th use, and on a new day when I've not heated it up yet, I put in the microwave for the maximum alloted time per the instructions, and what? It disintegrates in 2 places and the inner material falls out. Crappy crappy pack. Also, you know what's inside? Some kind of seed. Seeds?? No wonder the damn thing didn't retain cold at all, or heat for very long. Poorly designed item. Threw it away, and then a few days later thought I'd call them. Looked for them via the net... can't find 'em anywhere. No website, nothing. What a brilliant ""company."" Buy something else."
1,Great before it caught on fire in the micro,"For some reason, the tag caught on fire in the microwave, yes it was the correct amount of time, so be ware. REMOVE the tag and stay close to the micro as this thing could catch on fire on you too. Want an awful smell....Yikes. Buyer be ware."
2,Works Great BUT!!!!!,"What happened to the OLD bed buddy.This product was manufactured in at least two different generations. In the first generation, the woven bag was stuffed with a lot more of the warmable material inside.While the second generation prouct does produce heat and works reasoably well, it does not compare to the first go round.I was disappointed, but did not return it. However, you might also want to consider the:Herbal Concepts Hot/Cold Comfort Pac with Removeable Cover"
2,Not the same,"I've had an original bed buddy for over 15 years and I can honestly say this one is not even close. First of all, the picture on the web page is of the original. This version I received has a seam running down the middle of it. Second of all, I only heated up the original bed buddy for 88 seconds maximum and it stayed nice and warm for a very long time. The newer bed buddy must be heated up for the full 2 minutes and it starts to lose heat after 10 minutes. It is also very stiff. I even removed the center stiching so it would be more like the original, but it did not make a difference. This seller needs to insert the correct picture and description. I would return this one, but my original bed buddy wore out, plus I removed the stiching on the new one. Oh and did I mention the new bed buddy is made in China where the older one is American made?"
3,Bed Buddy Hot/Cold?,I read a lot of 5 star ratings on this product. I am guessing that its use as a hot pack is what is being evaluated. I followed the instructions to use it as a cold pack: place in a plastic bag and freeze overnight. I get a cool wrap that stays cool for 10-15 minutes. Not very useful. Did I miss something?
1,Useless as a cold pack,"I bought this while in pain at a CVS. I chilled this in a freezer overnight and was barely cool when I used it. I chilled it again and happened to leave it in the freezer for 2 days and the same. The shape is great for a shoulder, but it never gets cold. I wish I saved my receipt, it went in the trash."
4,Bed Buddy,I really enjoy my Bed Buddy. I also use it on cold nights to warm up the bed where my feet are going to be!
5,Love this,"For someone who gets a sore neck or back, this is a great product. This is the second time I have purchased one of these. It warms up really nicely in the microwave and conforms perfectly to those sore muscle areas. Very nicely made with soft but sturdy materials. The only downside is that they are not washable."
5,Does the job well!,My back doc recommended this and I was hesitant about the purchase. I was willing to try anything to help relieve some pain and this worked. I like its firmness and durability. It heats up quickly and has been helpful in easing my back pain.
5,exactly what I wanted,"I had a bed buddy pack from years ago and it was great, but after many years of use it was ready to be replaced. I was pleased when I saw these available and picked up a couple since I know they will get much use. I only use heated (not cold). I find it useful for a tight neck - how great to heat up for a minute and a half then throw over my neck when I'm running out the door to drive somewhere. I also use it on my knee prior to going on a run to loosen/warm up the muscles in a problem area. Soft, flexable and portable - a great product!"
2,Eh,It does get hot but it doesn't stay hot for very long...maybe 10-15 minutes...a warm towel sealed in a bag stays warmer waaay longer. Also smells weird. The shape is convenient for super low back pain but it's not worth walking to the microwave so frequently.
4,Good but limited usefulness,"Essentially it's a good product, but the usefulness is somewhat limited. It only stays warm for about 20 minutes at a time, and while it's great on my neck, it's too narrow for., say, my back. Overall, it's nice, but I still miss my old electric heating pad."
5,great remedy for sore neck muscles,These Bed Buddy's are the best for sore neck and shoulder muscles. They heat up easily in the microwave and last for several years. There also very portable for taking on trips when you need one.
4,Carex Bed Buddy Hot/Cold Pack,"Item was as advertized. It was not the origianl Bed Buddy that I had previously used, however it is a very good substitute."
3,boring history,"Very little interesting happens in this book. Think perhaps of a book on the history of a Canadian region. That would be far more likely to have important events than this text.Smart describes how Peel settled here, as one of the first British colonists. Keep in mind that Perth/Fremantle was only started in 1829. Peel saw a chance to grab a large portion of the coast below Perth from the Aborigines. The British considered the Aborigines to be utterly backward and having no valid claim on the land.The coastal town of Mandurah and the inland Pinjarrah were soon established. Tiny settlements that really didn't start developing to any extent till the 20th century."
5,Only Dragonball Movies Minus One,This 3 pack of Dragon Ball is pretty decent if you're a big fan of. The 3 movies are pretty similar in that they are spin-offs the original show. I would recommend this to anyone who is a huge fan of Dragon Ball but not so much to just casual fans of the series.
5,Dragon Ball and DBZ and GT are Te Best Animee ever.,Well is a cool pack movie. The thing is that is all summarized and they are not all the episodes together. But its cool.
1,Not worth the money,"I bought the twin product, HCM 100. Unfortunately it was money ill spent on a product that dispenses lukewarm coffee. I preheat my mug with water in the microwave which helps some.I also was expecting a much better tasting coffee. The first coffeemaker I got had a plastic tank that had a strong plastic smell which I could taste in the coffee. That appears to be a common problem. I returned that product because it leaked like crazy. Fortunately the current one does not have that issue."
2,The Beaded Lampshade Book,"The book has some nice ideas. Directions are complete. I am disappointed, however; that there are so few colored pictures."
4,Better Than You Think,"When I see this being re-sold for about a buck, I'm very surprised. This is quality material from a great band. Confidential was a rare radio-friendly hit for them and Meet Me Down In Birdland is still in their live rotation. Speaking of which, buy their albums, but by all means, go see then live. You'll never regret it !"
4,the the,The music and subsequent video see the the at their eclectic best. This is Matt Johnson's finest work and was for mine the album of the eighties. The title song 'infected' summed up the mood of love in the 80's with the advent of aids. Neneh Cherry makes a worthy addition in 'slow train to dawn'. All in all an album/video that should be in every collection.
1,lame,A LOT of money for something cheaply made. Not at all like the photo. My boys were very disappointed.
2,Not That Good,"I thought Nora's Hair Salon 2 would have been as entertaining as the original, how wrong was I! This movie didn't hold my interest at all. There are parts that just don't make any sense at all. At one point, I was like ""Okay what was that about?"" Well actually a few times I said this.I would suggest that you rent this movie instead of buying it."
2,I really tried to like this one,I really enjoyed part 1 but this one was just flat out horrible. It was all over the place and I honestly still dont know what the point of it was
4,Nora's Hair Salon 2,"Nora's nail salon has been handed over to her two nieces, Lilliana (Tatyana Ali) and Simone (Stacey Dash). With a history of not getting along, can the two cousins put their differences aside and come together for the sake of their family's business. If you have seen Nora's Hair Salon you will probably like Nora's Hair Salon 2. The sequel is a light-hearted comedy about two cousins that have different ideas about the salon. One wants to sell the salon the other wants to keep it. If you are in the mood for something easy to watch and want a few laughs along the way Nora's Hair Salon 2 is for you."
5,Excellent!,"This is a great album, containing enjoyable music, powerfully presented. Good addition to my collection. Particularly moved by ""Why I Like Roosevelt""."
1,not worth the rental,"This video is not one that I would expect to be offered by Amazon.com. The audio commentary is horrible, as if it were written by someone in high school. In some ways I would have preferred to watch this video without the voice over commentary. Not worth the $2.99 rental."
4,Genealogy backgound,"Helps a lot in understanding the economy of Colonial VA and the various blows dealt by Britain as well as the climate, etc. Helpful to genealogists. Lots ot data."
2,Poorly executed,"I've had one of these for more than 6 months, to connect a Moto PEBL into our phone system.It works very poorly. Making outgoing calls is fine, but every once in a while when an call comes in we pick up using a handset but can hear nothing and neither can the caller.It cannot be used to charge the PEBL.Another problem is that it interferes badly with our 802.11b WiFi system (it effectlvely disables a wireless music streaming device in the same room). We've unplugged it; I wish I had returned it."
2,disappointing,"I bought this phone system (base + extra b/w extension) over the summer specifically because of the forthcoming bluetooth cell dock. After waiting for months, it finally came out late fall. Bluetooth is difficult to set up on my Motorola cellphone (if any cellphone should be easy, it should be one made by the same company). Dock doesn't work as a charger for my phone. I rarely use it because once it is set up, it then becomes difficult to revert to landline calls. Should have probably returned it."
5,Excellent service!,This is a great book in very good condition. It was delivered quickly and was well packaged - altogether an excellent transaction. Thank you!As for the book itself - it is fabulous. I have had Wisdom Tales by the same author for a long time and absolutely loved it - and I had been looking forward to adding this to my collection. Although the stories don't have the same obvious moral twist as the first book - they are absorbing and well told. Heather Forest has a knack of taking folktales and rewriting them in a vivid way that makes them spring off the page. They are both excellent for reading out loud - but also for telling. A great resource book and one that I will enjoy for years to come.
3,Could've Been Better,"It was a GREAT story with well-done graphics and scenery BUT (and these are big buts for me) there were two things about this game that annoyed me.The dialogue was bad and the voice acting worse. If I understand it right, English wasn't this game's first language but it should've been the responsibility of the English speakers to get the tone right. The voice actors? Well, I don't know whether to blame them or again the script writers.And for the puzzles, some of them just made no logical sense and I had to go to a hints site.I did like this game a lot and I look forward to the sequel. Hopefully, they will work on improving the script and the actors.If you can tolerate weak dialogue and bad acting...I recommend this game. The story and graphics are GREAT!!"
3,there is not enough suspension of disbelief on the planet to play Tunguska,"Overall a well deisgned game with excellent graphics, Tunguskas fell to 3 stars because of a weak story and a poor finale (I will let slide the obnoxious dialog esp. the main characther). Too bad there is talent in the programmers team, maybe next time..."
3,Not logical puzzles,"When I first started this game, I was really excited while playing it. I REALLY enjoyed the atmosphere and scenary in the game (very cozy). However, once I really started playing more into the game, I found the puzzles got harder and harder. Besides the annoying and extreme long nonsense/confusing chatter, the gameplay was only about figuring out what to do next. I can't explain but it was like there was no fun parts to this game. Each puzzle/mission was so, non logical! For just about every puzzle/part of the game, I had to look at the walkthrough! There was nothing logical about the puzzles and they were so far out, you'd never guess which object to use/combine with what. The only thing I really liked about the game, was the scenary. But that's not worth playing this game for. So I stopped 50% through. *The puzzles also reminded me of the game Memento Mori as did the game too. And there was nothing about this game that reminded me of The Longest journey (like others claimed)."
3,"Great graphics, but predictable bad guys!","Great game, pretty easy, some difficulty matching objects to solve problems. Loved the hot spot highlight feature! Would recommend this game for those who loved syberia. I wished I could have explored more places such as the swamp, and the professor's house, just because the graphics were so great. But other places where i could explore alot gave me little pleasure or clues, such as the professor's office @ the museum. Will there be more titles under the Secret Files heading I wonder?"
3,HKS Speedloader Prevents Finger Cuts,"Pretty simple, easy to use, saves fingers from being cut or bruised by depressing the spring/bullet tray while loading the magazine. Shipping was quick and all in all it was a good transaction."
2,not a good buy,This product comes with virtually no help to work with it.Customer support was weak saying that they would not help with other software issues such as copying outlook express.The computer connection cord is ridiculously short.There are better products out there at prices much lower
5,Well-written and very encouraging,"This book is inspiring and well-written. It presents all Christian views concerning the return of Jesus Christ in a way that is not argumentative but easily understood, and not just by scholars. The content is thoughtful, well-supported and skillfully presented. It is also very spiritually encouraging."
3,Acceptable,"These work as a clothesline system, though not what you might have bought forty years ago. I would forget any idea about not setting them in concrete. We put them 20 inches in, with four inches of concrete, but still had to go back and do 20 inches of concrete.The three part system comes in handy for us, as occasionally we have to drive a truck back by the laundry area, and if we take the T-pieces off the top of these, we can then squeeze the truck through."
2,quality of craftmanship and details are bad,"this product upon putting together is not clear on instructions or on the product itself. the groves that stable the products standing position needs improved. We were told by the manufacturer that they had did an ""upgrade"" on the product and added the groves for more stabilization. I believe it needs further improving. it still has a wobbly movement and could stand to be even more secure."
5,A good book,"This is a helpful book for those interested in the new Russia. Although critical it covers fairly the rise of Putin and the Chechen war and threats to russias security as well as the 'new russia' including the suppression of the oligarchs and the disappearence of freedom of speech. A good book, one of many on Mr. Putin, this book is fair and it gives credit where it is due and dishes out criticism where it is due. No sympathy is shown for the murderers of Breslan.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,Hatchet Job,"A book with a lot of potential by authors with obvious familiarity with their subject matter that devolves into an unpersuasive hatchet job on the Putin government. The authors are quick to find fault with seemingly all aspects of modern Russia, failing in the meantime to acknowledge and explain the enormity of the challenges facing that nation and giving credit for progress and achieved successes. A truly objective look at both the failures and the successes of Putin and post-Soviet Russia would have been more informative and persuasive. The authors seem to have an agenda, which is not well disguised."
5,Putin 101,"One of the best books I have read on the New Russia--which, after reading the book, you see may not be so ""new"" after all. This excellent study of present-day Russia and its leader is concise, interesting, well-written, informative, and not just a little bit scary. After the Wild Wild West-ness of the Yeltsin years it was inevitable that a Sheriff would ride into Moscow and reign in the party. Vladimir Putin is that Sheriff, a man of (very) few words who prefers to let his actions speak for him. Anyone with even a passing interest in where Russia is today, where it might be headed, and the implication for the rest of the world will find this book well worth their time."
5,Oxygen Sensor,Worked fine in my Subaru Outback Wagon with the H6 engine. Direct replacement with original style plug so there was no splicing to do. Made the job easy.
4,A fair competition for Harry Potter!!!,Don't get me wrong I love JK but Diane gives her a run for her money. Using a whole other side of magic she keeps you guessing and hoping against hope that Nita an Kit make it out alive.
5,An underrated novel and one of the best ever,"I really have to wonder what ever became of Brad Solomon. Not only this mystery but hisThe Open Shadoware two of the most entertaining mysteries ever written. I have to put him as a cross between Charles WillefordThe Way We Die Nowand Michael Z. LewinThe Way We Die Now(who both oddly wrote excellent mysteries with the same title). If you are fascinated by Hollywood you'll enjoy this story of the search for a the son of a producer. It is way to complex to give a simple synopsis of, but well worth reading. You have to wonder what this talented author did to get his very excellent books so universally ignored.But read this. And readThe Open Shadow."
3,Works as expected,Works as expected in reloading the pistol. Locking mechanism not as good as other loaders. Would recommend purchase of this item.
5,Tremendously helpful!,"I am a premedical student in TN and obviously you realize I take very many science courses. As with any course, proper review and study time is necessary to make a good grade (Unless you're really smart.) This book was extremely helpful, especially the review chapters. I would recommend this to book to anyone who needs a little extra help, or even needs just a little review before taking a college level physics class. Highly recommended!"
2,Not a self teaching guide.,"This book has a lot of material that makes it worthy to be called a reference book, but as a self teaching guide it really comes up short. There is quite a bit of math (which is good in a physics book), but too little in the way of helping someone new to physics really understand the concepts. I considered returning this book for a refund, but decided to hang on to it for future reference. I think it will be useful to me after I've used some other book(s) to help be learn the fundamentals."
1,"Knowledgable author, horrible teacher","I have already studied physics, so I was able to follow this, but there is not a chance of understanding this without the previous knowledge. This is the kind of teaching strategy that is mostly memorizing and rote learning. You can ""learn"" what the book says, but you won't have a clue what it means. If you are only interested in spouting off physics facts to sound impressive, this book will do just fine. If you want to even begin to understand physics, you'll need to find a book that goes into the how and why of every phenomenon, rather than just stating that the phenomena exist."
1,Terrible,"This book does not cover much of what is covered in actual physics classes. It over explains simple principles and under explains more complex ideas. I used this book as a prep and it was very hard to get through and didn't explain much of what I had to know. Total waste of money. I'm now buying Physics for Dummies, which, now that I have tried and had to drop a college level physics class, is 200% better suited as a companion or prep guide."
2,"Lots of math, too little physics","I bought this book to help me cram for a physics final and was disappointed by the book's content. The author devotes a large portion to many basic math concepts which can be helpful if you need to brush up. However, once I got to the real physics, it was just a brief overview of the simple topics. Most of the concepts are there but he does not go into them in more detail. For example, he does not go into at all 2D kinematics which I was looking for. Also, concepts like torque and springs are ignored. Overall, this book is best for those who want an introduction into physics."
1,Mistakes continue,"Sadly, this book continues the misinformation of his prior book on relativity. He is completely unqualified on the subject, and gets it wrong from the very first concept: simultaneity. He states that two clocks can only be synchronized if they are right next to each other, and that the finite speed of light prevents synchronization at a distance. This is patently false. Any college physics book, and some high school ones, explain this topic correctly. I'm surprised it is so easy to publish a book on physics, without it ever being edited by anyone knowledgeable in physics."
5,All-around practical,It is hard to find an open-stock 2-quart saucepan. We were looking for a couple of simple pans to supplement the complete ScanPan set we already had. These are economical and sturdily made. They are perfect for preparing a rice dish or heating up a can of soup or some spaghetti sauce when the mid-size pan in your set is already in use or hasn't been cleaned from the last meal.
1,be aware,"This is not a 2 quart sauce pan, it is 2.5 quarts, exactly the same as the one that comes with the set"
4,A very pleasant surprise!,"I was pleased to discover this book, and to find it was really more than just a group of train station photographs - as beautiful as they are. The writer/photographer simply yet eloquently shares his love of these structures - both in his writing and in the loving way the many station photographs are presented and framed. I purchase a lot of design and architecture books. It is not often this type of book delivers so much ""heart"". A very pleasant surprise!"
3,Disappointing....,The photos are few and mediocre and the printing is of low quality with poor color saturation and muddy details (perhaps because it is printed in China?). Even the limited details of the stations themselves (the only written information in the book) is lacking in depth. Save your money....
2,not bad,there is chinese on the cover ! I am not so pleased with that . And I have not used it yet .
2,Awful customer support,I purchased the software three days ago and I am still not able to burn a DVD because of an error message. The online robotic support is of no use andthere is no way to speak to a live person. I am very dissapointed.
5,Excellent Halloween book,I read an edition of Starlog magazine about Bob Burn's Halloween extravaganas. I always wanted to attend one of these Halloween shows. Monster Kid Memories is as close as I will ever get. The book makes you feel like you were right there when it was being built and shown. Bob Burns is probably the greatest SciFi fan out there. The book is hard to put down once you start. I do wish Mr Burns would put a video out showcasing the Halloween shows. If you watch a documentary of The Time Machine you can see a portion of one of his shows.
4,Good Costume Reference for Medieval Ages and Later,"This is a really good costume book. It has detailed pictures, information on hair styles, shoes, clothes and accessories from Ancient Greece up through the 20th century. It also explains which styles came and went at which time during the era, and sometimes tells why. It also has a good description of the items it focuses on. But it focuses mainly on the 1200s-1800s, almost totally ignoring the romans, saxons, normans, and lacking in the greek, and the 20th century. Really in the 1900s it only goes up to the 1950s and disregards alot of cashual dress. It only covers civilizations in the Europian and US area, not including the American Indians or the US colonists. I would suggest this book for anyone that needs information on men's costume during the medieval ages or the 1800s in Europe."
1,AVOID,"If you love Xenakis's music, buy the CD. If you plunk down nearly $27.00 for the DVD, what you get is the same Hibiki Hana Ma on the CD (of course) but no visuals at all. Eighteen minutes of black screen. For the Polytope, there are various camera approaches to the playbill and a few still photographs. Otherrwise nothing. Material that should be in the CD booklet but which couldn't justify a DVD, much less one at this price. This is robbery."
1,WAAAAY OVERPRICED!!!,I thought one of the purposes of Kindle was to get e-books at below market price because you we're not purchasing the actual physical book which is superior to any e-book format. But $14 for this book? You gotta be kidding. How much is the actual book in hardcover? $25? $30? I'm sorry but this is an e-book. Even though Kindles has options such as highlighting it is never as easy to maneuver through an ebook as it is a real book. So someone tell the author to drop the price below $10 and I might consider buying it. Until then there are hundreds of other books with a similar content that I will consider.
3,Attention to detail,You have to like a book on the DC-10 that has a picture of a 707 or DC-8 on its back cover.
3,"Good in English, better in Russian","THis is an album to get if you want a good mix of english and foreign language tracks, musical versatility and to build up your ""Imports"" collection. Outside of this, its ok to have if you really want it. Its not great but it is not half bad either. BG is better with Aquarium rather than solo. Check out the Aquarium albums first before you buy this one."
5,Track list in Proper Order,I am adding this track list as it appears on the CD in proper order.1. 3:56 Radio Silence2. 4:31 The Postcard3. 4:37 The Wind4. 4:25 The Time5. 3:18 Winter6. 5:44 That Voice Again7. 3:39 Young Lions8. 4:01 Fields Of My Love9. 2:46 Death Of King Arthur10. 4:40 Real Slow Today11. 3:57 Mother12. 1:46 China
2,Ordinary.,"I like the HD music in SACD, DSD, PCM 24 bits, however this DVD-Audio is regular.I love Handel, but this DVD. I have seen others better than this.Regular"
2,Making a few bucks with stock footage and phony voice over.,"I'm quite dissapointed about this dvd. It is like a dull B movie compared to other rockumentaries. Even though the film actually shows trailers or scenes from all his 33 movies, the ""substance"" of this film comes from gossip or second hand info from books published long ago. Other than that, nothing new. The voice over is done by a second hand rate impersonator that seems like he's doing a parody of Elvis. It would be better that there were other dvds from Elvis like Elvis On Tour or films like Blue Hawaii, Flaming Star, Fun in Acapulco or Girls, Girls, Girls. Don't waste your money..."
2,I don't like it.,"There's a lot of rare footage in this film, the only problem is that it has an overdub of someone saying Elvis quotes all through the documentary and the guys trying to sound like Elvis and he fails. If we got more rare footage and removed the annoying impersonator overdub, this would be a nice movie for your collection. It does however mark the first time that anything from Elvis in Concert appeared on DVD (even though there's no audio). Nice addition to an Elvis collection but not something you'll watch often."
1,Horrible Elvis DVD,"This has to be one of the worst DVDs about Elvis I have ever seen. The movie clips and actually footage of Elvis are good, but nothing new and can be seen elsewhere. The worst part is the fake Elvis voice-over! I consider myself a huge Elvis fan and more than half of the information is incorrect and extremely misleading. Elvis would have never said those things. This is a poorly produced DVD that looks as if it were edited in someone's garage. I am sorry I purchased it and hope to save you some money. I would give a 0 star if available....."
3,"Cute, but too small","Manhattan Toy Lullaby Wooden Cradle for Baby StellaMy 19 month old daughter received Baby Stella and a few accessories for Christmas. She loves her doll so much that I wanted to purchase something else for her. We chose the cradle and it arrived today. I was quite surprised to receive a package the size of a box of grapenuts. My husband put it together, and it is very cute, but so small. Baby Stella barely fits, and unfortunately that means we will probably end up buying her another baby doll bed that her other dolls will fit in also. Based on this, I would probably not recommend this purchase, especially for the price."
3,Spend money on bigger one,I read bad reviews and bought it anyway because I loved the design BUT IT IS TOO SMALL. We will be putting my daughters beanie babies in it. If you need a real crib for dolls don't buy this one. I would invest money into larger crib.
1,Disappointing and very badly made - looks pretty but avoid!,"My daughter got this baby stella cradle for her 2nd birthday, it came flat packed - not a problem we thought - but the screw holes didn't line up, so we had to try and make new holes which then split the wood (we didn't use a big drill bit, just a wee one) so then we had to glue the side of the cradle and have a clamp on it for a couple of days but it seemed fine when it set.Then my daughter played with it for about, hmm say 30 minutes tops and the rocker broke with the dowling breaking so the glue will have to come out again and glue the other end because it's loose too, argh! It looks lovely but it's such a disappointment and quite expensive for a wee cradle that doesn't even last a day with a toddler playing gently with it!"
2,Cute but falls apart,"The Baby Stella cradle is very cheaply made. The feet fell off after one week. For the price, I would expect better quality."
4,Arrived right on time and in excellent condition,"I ordered this game for my 6 year old son, who is already an avid video game player. The game arrived before the estimated delivery date, and it was in excellent condition. No scratches or smudges on the game. It worked great, and he is still playing it! I would definitely buy from this seller again!"
2,"Decent game, but looks dated.","I bought this for the kids - they had a newer spongebob game and loved it. This one, hey like it, but the gameplay and graphics are noticably less sophisticated on the PS2 - it looks like a PS1 game - maybe it was. I'd buy one of Spongbob's later releases instead of this one."
4,Great game!,"This game is great(it was a little too easy to beat) but overall it was really fun and strange to play. It was a little off the subject of spongebob, didnt have any quirks from the show, but it was fun to play. Do not use cheatcodes cause they make the game go by to fast!"
4,Krusty Krab,My daughter has really enjoyed playing this game. She is a big Spongebob fan ( I tend to favor Mr. Krabs) and this game has delivered all the enjoyment she had hoped for.
4,Love It,"So many of the video games that come out these days are way too complicated in my opinion. This game is simple enough that my kids can figure out how to play, but also has the rigt amount of humor to be fun for adults too. Great fun for the whole family."
3,"One-sided, Yet Compelling Portrait","On my on going search for an balanced book on interfaith marriage, this was a disappointment. But if you're looking for a book on how to successfully convert to judaism, this book is for you. It is well written, and interesting, but as the characters continue to scroll by, you notice the uncanny similarity. Each couple is undecided about the religion they want their families to relate to, and consequently each couple decides either to convert to Judaism, or break up. Again, this book is a good read, but if you are looking for portrayals from all sides of the issue, look elsewhere."
1,I threw it away after a few pages,"I happened on a copy of this many years ago. I'm Catholic and my wife is Jewish so I thought it would be interesting to read. A few pages into the book, the author describes the Bris cermony performed on her newborn son. The author related that since her son had already had a medical circumcision at the hospital, the ceremony consisted of sticking the boy's private part with a pin until blood was drawn and he cried. I thought about that for a few seconds ... the woman let someone stick her newborn son's private part until he was in enough pain to cry and bleed ... for no medical reason. I then concluded that this woman must be clueless and can't have anything useful to say. I threw the book away. It's been 10 years and I still stand by my conclusion that the rest of the book couldn't have been worth reading."
5,Very good! All Saddlebred people should read this book.,"I greatly enjoyed reading ""Prescription: Murder"". Joan Robinson is part of saddlebred history and finding out how she died has been something I have always wondered about. I first read ""Blood and Money"" and in talking to other saddlebred owners and riders I found out there was another book about Joan's death. It took over a year for amazon.com to find this book, but it was definitely worth it. You should also read ""Blood and Money""!!"
3,Very used but glad to have it!,"""Prescription Murder"" is a fascinating true story by the 2nd wie This book has been out of print and so received an old and very used copy. Was mainly glad to have it, as I had been looking for it. All in tact and not at all falling apart, it was worth it!"
1,Uh... it's ok,"Alright well I'm a HUGE blink fan and I own all their CDs and I thought that this song was REALLY depressing! Normally Blink songs are fast and make you feel good, but this one is too slow and sad!"
2,"Bizarre, at times slightly interesting but very flawed","This book could have been so much more. It is flawed by a very odd writing style---deadpan and stilted. The format is so odd as to make it almost unreadable at times---two blocks of print on each page, at very different levels, as if one is meant to be a caption, yet it isn't! The author doesn't seem to know whether she wants to be a book for the curious, or a book condemning you for being curious. A fascinating subject, which is why this book can be interesting at all, but really not handled well here---don't bother with this one."
2,a mediocre overview of a fascinating subject,"The illustrations are spectacular in Special Cases, and many of the anecdotes are vividly written. But the author also omits much of the subject matter's historical and scientific context, leaving the ""special cases"" looking more like simple freaks. As well, this book is poorly organized and poorly edited, so that by the end I was completely frustrated with Ms. Purcell."
2,A Disappointment,"Visually, the book is rewarding. The author has photographed her specimens imaginatively, compelling the reader to look twice to identify the subject matter. The text, however, is a great disappointment. Not only is the format confusing (as some reviewers have already pointed out), but with a writing style so disjointed and without an appreciable sense of structure, the book leaves us readers floundering in a fishpond, desperately seeking the shore."
1,Disappointing,"I got the feeling he wrote a book around some vacations he took. He references the Mutter Museum multiple times, so if you're really interested in a book on anomalies, look into the Mutter Museum book. Don't waste your money on this one!!"
2,"Interesting, if you don't pay too much for it.","If you get this used, you won't mind so much that it repeats itself too often and runs out of steam halfway. I think I am much swayed by the photos, this is a coffee-table book, not a reference book. I am boggled at the typography decisions, I suppose someone has been reading too much WIRED and thought it looked avant garde. It does reek.If you are much into the subject I'd say you will find something to enrich you here, esp if you can get a good deal on the book somewhere."
5,My favorite storyteller tells inspirational stories,"Jackie Torrence is probably the most enthralling storyteller on the storytelling festival circuit today and these are some of her best stories. These stories tell of great people in her life: her grandmother, mother, and aunts mostly, whose wisdom and strength of spirit have kept her on course. Jackie is one of the most popular storytellers at the National Storytelling Festival and these are just great stories. Know someone who needs emotional shoring-up? Give them this audio!"
3,deters theives and me...,"Pros: super strong, the nylon coat protects my bike's paintCons: super heavy, the built-in lock jams frequently (leaving me in the rain/cold trying to jiggle my key free)The lock jams are super annoying...I might look into buying a different version.Update: key broke in lock the other day...epic fail...DO NOT buy this lock!UPDATE #2: I called the manufacturer directly and told them about the key fail. They sent me a new unit that working much better. hopefully it keeps working!"
3,"Good recording, but not essential...","I was expecting more of this recording. It has Harnoncourt, and you will find some great fresh reinterpretation of some passages, but Ada is an Opera that depends too much on the singing, and that is the disappointment. Some of the singing is just mediocre, and some is exciting and first class, but that does not make a consistent performance: Gallardo-Domas is making a good effort all the time, but she does not have the voice for Ada... La Scola is so mediocre that I cannot find why is he singing in this production... Hampson has a very handsome voice and you can really appreciate his singing, and Borodina is just an incredible Amneris (the only reason to buy his set)...I belive Harnoncourt could have chosen a better Ada and Radamès for this recording... on the light side, as it happens to be the case... After all, there were big expectations for this recording."
5,Best of Luomo,"I have to disagree with the more negative reviews and say that I love this album. It's not as dance-floor oriented as the other Luomo albums. Very soulful, a bit more freeform and experimental. It has the soundscape elements that I love about Vladislav's other work balanced with the more vocal Tech-House style of Luomo.I would rank this as Luomo's best album."
2,"Good, but doesn't compare well to the others","""Paper Tigers"" is a good effort but if you are a fan of ""Vocal City"" (4 stars) and particularly ""Present Lover"" (5+ stars), you will be somewhat dissappointed in this cd. Those two others are so much better.I wrote a much more detailed review but this silly review writing feature lost it and now you get the abridged version. Amazon, get it together!"
3,Decent,"Marques Houston has been in the game for quite a while first with Immature then IMX then as a solo artist. I would consider him a veteran for the length of time he has been a performing artist but he has not really put out anything that makes you stand back and say ""wow!"". So, a verteran as far as churning out good songs, I would have to disagree.His latest effort 'Veteran' is a decent release with a few solid songs with some decent R&B; on it. But, it's a CD you will probably listen to for a few months and then either remove it from your iPod or put the CD back up on your shelf.The song that stands out the most on here is ""Like This"" with Yung Joc - a very great club bumper with a tight rap by Yung Joc. My favorite song on the CD. Other stand out tracks are ""Exclusively"" and ""Circles"" - great R&B.; The rest of the songs are just mediocre R&B.;~~~JAC 07'"
5,Underrted artist,"Marques Houston is one of the best male R&B singers out there. He is so underrated by media and doesn't get the credit that he deserves. He has been gracing the music industry with his vocals for a while beginning in the mid 90's with the boy group IMX with their single first time. He has matured since those days with the group, and has dabbled in television with a recurring role of Roger on the hit television show Sister/Sister. This cd shows his realness with such tracks as Exclusive, Favorite Girl and the club hit Like This ft. Yung Joc."
4,Crazy about MH!,"I bought this album just beacause favorite girl is a "" GREAT"" song.Then I was surprised that I liked about 4 other songs. I wish the cd was edited though I am not a fan of cussing."
4,good,"Better than I expect it to be. I only bought it for ""circle"" but I like the other songs as well."
3,Stories are not in English,"The description states the language of the book is in English...but the stories are all in Chinese characters. Some of the words are translated at the end of each section, but unless you read Mandarin, you can't read the stories. From the description it sounds like the stories are both in English and Mandarin in their entirety...but they're not."
4,"Gay comedians work on ""coming out"" stories","(Contrary to the current listing on Amazon, this DVD was actually released December 4th.)Seven ""out"" gay comedians are featured in a June 2003 concert in Santa Monica CA, telling their personal and friends' ""coming out"" stories. Featured are Rene Hicks, Dan (""Real World - Miami"") Renzi, Bob Smith, Terry Sweeney, John Riggi, Sabrina Matthews and Jackie Beat. Production quality is above average for comedy compilations, though I've heard better material from most of the comics involved. Probably best suited for a group dealing with coming out issues."
4,The Campbell Rhinestone Review,This is a great CD with 10 Popular Tracks: By The Time I Get To Phoenix; Wichita Lineman; Galveston; It's Only Make Believe; Dream Baby;Manhattan Kansas; Country Boy (You Got Your Feet In LA); Sunflower; Southern Nights; Rhinestone Cowboy.Great songs for any Glen Campbell fan!
5,tdshotts,"This book contains three stories: ""Reluctant Father"" by Diana Palmer, ""Rent-A-Husband"" by Annette Broadrick, and ""The Wedding Wager"" by Elizabeth Bevarly. I bought it primarily for the Diana Palmer story, but I really enjoyed the other two as well. It was a great read."
2,Slightly disappointed reader,"Madeline Baker is absolutely my favorite romance author and I was very eager to read Unforgettable. It's a time travel romance about a divorced woman named Shaye that travels back in time to the town of Bodie and falls in love with a gambler named Alejandro. I don't think it was a very romantic story and I learned much more than I wanted to about Bodie. It just wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but of course others are bound to disagree. Still, she is a good writer with a style of her own and I recommend A Feather in the Wind and Midnight Fire."
3,Variation,I've already read a variation on this story by another author which I thought was much better. With all the subject matter avaiblable I can't imagine what two ghosts of two different men in two different stories were hanged and became ghost to fall in love with a live woman
2,Cute but KILL your piggies!,These boots are so cute but will KILL your toes. I can walk and stand in them for less than an hour. I would probably get a half size bigger.
1,Don't waste your time or money.,"This book seems like it was written from a template. In other words all the sections are written generically for ""Fill in the blank"" disease. The authors are not experts on Wislon's disease and don't claim to be. It's basically a reference book that refers you to other sources. There's no real advice regarding Wilson's disease. I looked at this book for 5 minutes before deciding to return it. Buy George Brewer's book instead. He's been studying and treating Wilson's disease for more than 20 years."
2,This is NOT a Spanish book,"Be very careful ordering - check the ISBN. The Spanish translation is ISBN 0-673-36292-2. The English easy reader with just a *few* words of Spanish (un, dos, tres, si) is ISBN 0-673-36195-0. Quite simple - except for ""mountain"" on the 2nd page. ...The same reviews are used for both books. I do not know how to ensure you get the one you want."
2,Defective Goods,"I have a perfectly good version of this design for my Beretta 84. The problem here is this larger model arrived with the thumb lever broken right off. My email was ignored and although I sent it right back, I have had no response of any kind from the dealer. So while H&K are off the hook I am not very happy."
1,amazon has the item#'s all messed up,"HKS LARGE CALIBER SINGLE STSACK MAGAZINE SPEEDLOADER, amazon has the item#'s all mess up , so it was impossible to get the item i needed, according to HKS , the item # was the same, as what amazon was posting, but every time i would receive the item, model and the item"" were wrong ,the picture they have posted, does not match the item #, we went around with this twice, then i just requested a refund and purchased it somewhere else. the last email i received from amazon was they were going to launch an investigation,"
5,Surprise,"I bought this without reading the description. I thought it was the regular ""will return"" plastic sign that tells people when you'll be back. When it arrived, the first thing I noticed was it has a second hand, which made me laugh at the stupidity of a second hand on a plastic ""will return"" sign. Then I realized this thing is battery operated. Stupendous! My husband has now installed this on his office, and it brings laughter and joy to all. Works great. Everyone laughs. And after re-visiting this item's description, we are glad to know it's a novelty item and not a dumb manufacturing mistake."
4,"Lovely set, but NOT cereal bowls!","I ordered one box of these and returned them when I discovered that the box contained four tiny condiment bowls, not the cereal bowls pictured and described under ""what's in the box."" Then I saw a promotion with a new picture and thought that somehow we had managed to find the cereal bowls--but no such luck. This set contains four tiny little CONDIMENT bowls (which will hold maybe two tablespoons of nuts) and not the cereal bowls. However--this is a lovely set of durable dishes, and I do love them! I plan to use them year-round!"
4,Didn't get what I ordered!,"As I see with the three other reviews of this product, I did not get the cereal bowls I was expecting. The 16-piece dinnerware set of Lenox Winter Greetings that I ordered for a wedding present was shown with four cereal bowls, but instead I received four condiment bowls. We are going ahead and giving the gift as is, but I wanted to post my complaint of Amazon.com not shipping what its website had pictured for this order. I find it deceiving. I want my four cereal bowls...the condiment bowls are stated on the box to be a FREE gift!!!! Please respond with your plans to correct this problem."
3,missing cereal bowls,"I ordered the 16 piece set of the winter greetings everyday for a Christmas gift. My daughter opened the box on Christmas day and was surprised that the box said 12 piece set and did not contain the cereal bowls as advertised and pictured on the website. It did however come with a ""bonus"" 4 condiment bowls. Still in the process of getting the problem fixed."
3,"Lovely set, but not as pictured or described","I ordered 3 sets so that I would have service for 12. The ""16-piece"" sets I received each contained 4 dinner plates, 4 salad plates, 4 mugs and 4 tiny condiment bowls, not the lovely cereal bowls that are pictured. The condiment bowls nest inside the top of the mug, to give you an idea of the size. The label on the box describes it as a 12-piece set with 4 bonus condiment bowls. I had a replacement order sent and received 3 more 12-piece sets with the bonus condiment bowls, but no cereal bowls."
3,Dog sweater not for some dogs or cats,I had this sweater for just a few days and it got destroyed. All the fur is glued on so it didn't last long.
5,Best Song of ALL TIME!,"This is the business...its an amazing song. It spoke to me, and it haunts all who hear it! I defy anyone not to like it. If you dont like this..then you got no taste, style or business liking music. I dedicate this to my LADY GILL. Who is also awesome!"
1,Pass On It's Deductible,"Downloading this through an offer in TurboTax, it looks great. I quickly entered some data, only to find out that the database was corrupted. I did get a response, after 15 minutes on the phone, to email them and received a new database (a password protected excel file), which meant I had to retype the data.Then the program did a TERRIBLE job of transferring to TurboTax, created needless extra forms and not correctly transferring the data.Further, the program tells you you can enter expenses for Misc. Deductibles, but what they DON'T tell you is that you can only print those out. In my case, it wouldn't even do that, and an email to the company got zero response.Huge waste of money, and they want to sell you next year's version now.Pass it up."
4,A great basic guide to strikes for the street and NHB competition.,"I have read and reviewed many of Mark Hatmaker's books and videos. Like all his material, there is no B.S. involved in his approach to fighting. Having been involved in numerous martial art and combative systems, I found the material in this volume most relevent for beginners; however, even experienced people involved in combative systems need to review the basics. In my opinion, the real value of this book can best be appreciated when used in conjunction with actual hands-on training with a competent boxing and/or martial arts instructor. One thing the author and I can agree on is the fact, that in most cases, boxing has the most effective punching techniques of any other martial art. In conclusion, this is a book that one must actually study and practice the techniques in order to learn the material.Rating: 4 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Monadnock Defensive Tactics System, MDTS)"
5,The NHB Striking Bible!,Mark Hatmaker is one of the best technicians of NHB I have ever seen. This book is one of the best books written on the subject of NHB. Hatmaker's approach is easily understood and can be readily applied in the ring or on the street. I would definitely recommend his material to both beginners and seasoned fighters alike. This book has something to offer everyone
5,Hatmaker does it again!,Mark Hatmaker has truly made the martial arts his lifelong passion and now proves he has the background and technical knowledge to teach it effectively!
5,Fantastic,"I take my hat off to Mr. Hatmaker. He has compiled a great reference of strikes for NHB, as well as any conflict that might arise. What makes this book even better is that it is not only a great representation of the strikes, it is a reference on the opportunities to use them and use them effectively.I was impressed with the great detail for each strike. Highly recommended for anyone interested in NHB or self defense. I also recommend his books on submissions as well.Well Done."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!! TERRIBLE BOOK TO LEARN FROM,This book is not a very good book to learn from. I train with World-class fighters including UFC fighters and K-1 fighters. Many of the fight stances and Boxing forms are incorrect and telegraph your moves. The pictures are terrible and could easily mislead many beginner fighters. I recommend you to not purchase this book and instead spend your $10 on a class with a good instructor. You will learn more from a hour of that than this book.
5,THE BEST!,"If you have high cholesterol, try this! My doctor wanted to put me on a cholesterol-lowering prescription medication but I told the doc I wanted to try a natural approach. This supplement shocked my doc! In a couple of month's time, it brought my levels back down to normal!"
3,A pleasant read,"Three young girls grow up together in a small English village and keep in touch as they grow older, even though their life paths veer in very different directions. Sweet, gentle Liv marries what she sees as the man of her dreams, only to find herself locked into a dark, possessive relationship. Katherine had always sworn off marriage and domesticity after seeing the soul crushed out of her mother by the demands of husband and family and Rachel who marries young and against her father's wishes. The story of their young lives and how they interconnect is a nice little read (which sounds as if I'm damning it with faint praise), not earth shattering but pleasant."
5,"Exact match for original equipment, at a very reasonable price.","I am very glad I was able to find the capacitor on Amazon, as my local garage door opener dealer/installer (a large and reputable firm that installed the opener in 1993) no longer carries this capacitor. They did, however, give me a similar, but larger, used capacitor (that would not fit inside the door opener enclosure) at no charge so my garage door would work (with the temporary capacitor hanging down from the unit) until I could find an exact replacement. The replacement capacitor arrived from Amazon ahead of schedule."
1,Innacurate and misleading,"The measurements for the projects in this book were entirely off. I did one of the projects, ""Explore Virtual Harmony With a Harmonograph."" The materials list was wrong, the measurements were wrong, the diagrams were wrong, and the harmonograph didn't work. I do not recommend this book at all to anyone, unless they have plenty of time to make mistakes and get around all the innacuracies in the book."
4,Interesting Projects,All the projects in this book were original and interesting. We especially liked the medieval slingshot device. Good book if you want something different.
5,amazing dvd,I have all of the MST3K commercial releases and this is easily the best volume. Five wonderfully irreverent episodes without a dud in the lot and hours worth of great entertainment. Run out and grab this set before it goes out of print.
5,Gamera Gamera he's really neat he is made of turtle meat,what is there to say about MST3K to those in the know this show is awesome and this set includes all of the Gamera episodes in season 3 of MST3K. They come in a really cool tin box along with some really cool mini posters. MST3K is this really awesome show about this guy marooned in space and forced to watch really bad movies by a mad scientist as an experiment. To fight off the effects of the really bad movies the guy along with Tom Servo and Crow which are robots crack jokes and make comments about the film. MST3K is gone now but for those who enjoy it you should check out Rifftrax its kind of the same thing.
2,MST3K Lover - With a Heavy Heart. : (,"I feel sad to give this review.In general - I love MSTK, Cinematic Titanic and Rifftrax. I have volumes 1-22 of MST3K).In my opionion - some are better than others. To begin with - I am Not fond of the Gamera movies. I bought this set (MST3K 21 - Standard Edition) with low expectations - and was still disappointed.The Gamera films in themselves did not interest me on any level, and most of the riffs didn't hit home for me.I don't know what more Joel and the guys could have done.I look forward to checking out MST3K-23 in March (2012).I still love the show and the premise.This is also available in a Deluxe Edition - which from what I can tell is only different by being in a tin box. And not much for extras on here.I plan to keep this volume - but only to keep my sets complete (kinda crazy).I understand - no one hits home runs every time.If you share my taste - I'd skip this set all together. Sincerely, Scott M."
2,"I'll buy it, begrudingly...","Compared to the boxed sets in the past this one comes up short. I sense the end is near for this grand repackaging run, and I can only shudder in fear of what's in store for Misty fans when they start rolling out the Blu-rays. My main complaints for this boxed set is the lack of any collectible and the relatively high price (though I'm sure this is due to licensing). Will somebody please smell the coffee and get this show back on the air, the merchandising end of it is working better than most shows that have been running for ten years!I'll buy this boxed set so I can have all of them, but this will be a hard one to swallow."
1,piece of junk,"This thing is a piece of junk! My daughter begged for this for a year and a half to keep her little brother out of her ""make-up"" before we finally gave in. After two hours of struggling we finally got it to record her voice then it wouldn't recognize her voice when she wanted to open it back up. We tried for hours days on end to get it to open. Finally we had to bust the lock for her to get her make-up out. Don't waste your money on this awful technology."
1,I HATE IT!!!!,"This whole thing is a peice of crap. I got it for christmas and so did my cousin. It would't even let us set a password. It just kept on saying "" Oh, I can't hear say it again!""Do not waste your MONEY ON THIS PEICE OF CRAP. at the end i just wrecked it open."
1,Psychotic,"I ordered the movie Psychotic because it was listed under Kathleen Kinmont vhs videos. When I told Amazon.com that she was not in the film they said it was my fault. I put search vhs, then kathleen Kinmont. The movie Psychotic comes up. I order it and the old hag Elizabith Taylor is in it. Kathleen never appears."
3,great sound,"These headphones have great sound, and the volume control is very, VERY convenient. The downside to these headphones for me is the fit. They do not seem snug enough over my head, and move a bit when I'm walking."
5,How and Why to Buy,"This Hamilton and Weiss book was given to us as a gift. It was our first experience with their books. We are very grateful to have this book in our collection and what a great place to start!The length of each story and child friendly layout of the book really encouraged my kids to, not only read, but to tell these stories. The ""How and Why World Tales..."" are right in line with questions kids are always asking. They love to ask and they love to search for answers. These multi-cultural tales stimulate the thinking power of children and encourage their imaginations.The illustrations and stories are in perfect harmony. After a wonderful collection of tales, Hamilton and Weiss offer a master's class at the end of the book. They suggest many ways to read, practice, and tell these stories. Their energetic support to tell leaps off of the page as if they are right there to coach. They offer more story prompt ideas which expand the book even further. They are masters."
4,Another side of Blayne Cooper,"I REALLY liked this book. I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion as I kept turning the pages. A rather short book, but a cute, very likeable story. Not challenging, just pure entertainment. A quick, FUN read. Too short!"
3,Please enter a title for your review,"hey eric, welcome to saddle creek records. just leave your talent and creativty at the door, we don't have any use for that stuff around here. maybe you could just s**t out some bland basic standard-chord fingerpicking, i think the kids would really eat that up, what with Iron And Wine's success and all. we'll put you in the studio this weekend, no sense wasting time on developing ideas when the kids won't notice the difference anyway. we'll also need to put a picture of you with a beard on the cover, just to emphasize the connection, y'know so that kids know what image you're trying to project just in case the genericness of the music isn't clear enough. ok, so just sign here and wait for the indie dough to roll in. thanks dude, pleasure doing business with you."
5,great choice,"This is one of the BEST books you can find on the techniques used for decorative painting as well as a good sourcebook in getting started in the business. Detailed photos and lots of explaining by the authors brings their 'school' (The Finishing School, Inc of NYC) alive for those of us who cannot get there. I would also like to recommend ART OF FAUX by Finkelstein, and for all you traditionalists who want the vinegar/fantasy grained look of antique furniture, DECORATIVE FURNITURE FINISHES WITH VINEGAR PAINT by Russell and FOLK FINISHES by Teles, as you will be hard pressed to find these at your local bookseller. Altogether, these four books will get you jumpstarted into the wonderful world of painted finishes...one you won't want to leave!"
5,the best book,even i am 11 years old . i still love this book so much.my mom got it when i was little . i hope you love it too.
3,It's ok....,"I bought this because the shop that I go to wanted $219 for a brand new one. I have a glass pack muffler and was hoping the converter would quiet the truck down quite a bit....but it didn't, it's quieter, but not by much. But, hey it's cheap and it serves its purpose."
3,really made for large fish,i bought this for pan fish like bluegill but it really has too large a gap to hold them so now i have two that i probably can't use
4,Fun version of Risk,"This is a short alien version of Risk. It is fun, fast paced and great for a quick sit down with the kids to just enjoy 30 mins to an hour."
1,Lenox Winter Greetings Gold Banded Ivory China House Finch 9 Accent Plate,I ordered this plate along with the downy woodpecker. There was a fullfillment error. I received two house finch plate and never got the woodpecker plate. I sent one of the two plates back. I was very disappointed with how this order was handled.
2,"run, run very far away",I was sick with the flu this week and this book was all I could find. Kinda makes the whole concept of a benevolent god hard to swallow. Please don't bother to buy the book. The author is trying desperately to be Tom Clancy and he's failing miserably. Not only is the whole premise unbelivable everything about it rings false. The Governor of Maine disappers for a few days and no one says a word? Just believe me and ignore it. If you're aleady half way through it and don't want to read the rest I'll be happy to tell you the ending.
5,Miracle in a Bottle,"I purchased this product about 3 months ago and it is a miracle in a bottle. My hair was breaking off for unknown reasons. After the first use, I noticed my hair stopped breaking. I use this product every two weeks on my relaxed hair. The key is to wash your hair with your regular shampoo, rinse and then put Emergencee on. Leave it on for at least 5 minutes. (Once I went outside and did a little shopping and came back.) Wash the product out with water only, then shampoo your hair again and condition and style as usual. My hair is stronger, healthier, and bouncier then it has ever been. When I comb my hair in the shower or out of the shower there is little or no breakage. I could go on and on about this product. I will never do without it."
5,Best thing I've used so far,"I am a product junkie and have spent shameful amounts of money on products that don't work. This is one of the more expensive things I've tried - but this one really works.You should be warned - this is NOT a deep conditioner. When you rinse it out, you really need to follow it up with a good moisturizing conditioner and leave it on for 3 minutes or so. If you do not, you will rinse this out and think your hair feels like straw and you'll be horribly disappointed. I know I was. But if you follow it up with a good conditioner, you'll notice a huge difference. My hair has never been so soft or felt so healthy.I used it once a week for two weeks, then backed off to one time every two weeks. I have fairly long hair and I'm getting about 6 uses out of a bottle. Even though this is on the expensive side, I will definitely repurchase."
5,Fabulous!,"When I first tried this product, I thought I'd been mislead: The formula is an odd smelling gel that is in no way thick or shape-holding. It's very liquidy. It also seems to disappear after you put it in, and your hair feel rubbery, especially when you wash it out.But here's the thing: It actually works!!! I used this immediately after undergoing the color-removal process, and it resealed my porous, vulnerable hair. It even prevented my ends from splitting.I realize that it's very pricey, but it's totally worth it. Nexxus is expensive because they pay human volunteers to salon test their products, thus skipping the evil animal testing step. So when you buy this, know that your indulgence will leave you with great hair and no guilt."
5,Great.,"This product works on all hair types and all races. After you wash your hair, apply an ample amount to your hair I allow it to stay on my hair for 10 minutes I sit under the dryer, then I rinse it out and wash my hair again, apply conditioner, rinse out the conditioner and style as usual. My hair is stronger since I have been using it."
3,:l,Been using this product for a month or so and can not see much of a difference in my dry breaking brittle hair but I will give it more time!
2,Im still waiting for the results,"I bought this product and i already used 4 times, it says you can use every 2 weeks, i have really weak hair and it breaks so much that my bathroom floor is full of little pieces of hair..i hate that!I still didnt notice any improvement, but im gonna keep using untill im done with the bottle and if i see any direfence i will keep using or not."
2,Not thrilled,"My hairdresser told me to purchase this product after I ""self highlited"" and caused extensive damage to my hair. I don't like the feel of this product in my hand. I don't like the way my hair feels when I use it and the smell is not great. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,This doesn't do one thing for my hair,"I have tried using this twice and gave up on it. If anything it makes my hair more tangled and dry than it was to start with. I am really not sure what it is supposed to do or what kind of hair it might actually help. I have long fine hair, easily tangled, and this neither smooths nor untangles it. It is watery and seems to be some sort of fake product, the way it does nothing. It's the only thing I've ever tried on my hair that seemed to have absolutely no effect at all. Don't waste your money on this.I also don't understand some reviews preaching how you leave this on and it gets hard, blah blah blah...... this sort of wrecks my hair. My hair needs moisture, not to be parched to bone hardness. Kerastace Ciment Anti-UsureCIMENT ANTI-USUREmakes my hair gorgeous and is basically a fast easy rinse out."
4,Good product,"A friend recommended this product to me, at first I was reluctant to try it but when I did I was really happy with the result. My hair has been thining and dropping out for sometime now and after i used the product i have seen some improvement. I would certainly recommend it."
5,A look into the life of a beautiful soul,"I've always loved the work of Susan--I was enchanted with her animal drawings and as an artist I was curious to learn more about how she created her works. This book was more than I could have hoped for. The book covers Susan's life and her influences it also shows her progression as an artist as well as the influences that helped shape her art.If you are a fan of Susan's work then this is a must have book for your collection, you won't be disappointed."
2,GOOD CD SPOILED BY POOR SOUND QUALITY,I was greatly disappointed by the sound quality of this CD when compared to my vinyl copy of the same title.
3,Twist type of speed loaders not ideal,"The type of shooting matches I do, speed is critical. These particular loaders do perform their intended function. However they are a twist type release and the rotation of the twist is congruent with the rotation of the cylinder and requires you to hold the cylinder tightly when releasing the bullets. I prefer the automatic type that release as a function of the insertion pressure."
3,It's okay,"I bought this for my smith and wesson 686. The body of the speed loader has trouble fitting next the handle on my revolver which only allows the tip of the ammo into the cylinder before I release the speed loader. I don't know if I'll use it very often. Maybe it would work better if I change the grips, but not worth it at this point."
4,Good for Me,"Works fine, no problems. Makes it very fast to reload my revolver (Ruger gp100). I'd recommend it especially for the price."
4,Speedloader,Works just as I expected. It Loads quickly and efficiently. To date there are no problems problems to report .
3,"Better than hand loading, but room for improvement","I bought these for use with a Ruger GP100. While they are effective, they don't load as smooth as I anticipated them to. That being said, I'd still rather use these over hand loading, escpecially if I was in a situation where my life depended on a quick reload."
1,WRONG Speedloader shipped for GP100,"I ordered the HKS 586-A, which is the 6 shot speedloader that works with the Ruger GP100. What came was the 587-A, which is a seven shot speedloader-- WILL NOT WORK WITH A 6 SHOT! Amazon is working with HKS to get this corrected, but would advise NOT to order until the special message at the bottom of the Amazon screen (when viewing the HKS 586-A item) clears. I was able to return the 2 speedloaders I purchased, but really bums me out that I now have to wait yet another few weeks to get the right speedloader. Buyer beware-- you may want to check this out first before buying."
5,Nice tool,"I decided to purchase two for my GP100 .357 Magnum revolver. I carry extra pistol mags, why not some extra for the wheel gun?Well made, easy to use and holds the rounds securely. I bought one of theseHKS Cordura Double Speedloader Caseto store and carry the speedloaders."
5,Great speed loaders,These HKS speedloaders are good quality. Very easy twist & turn knob allows for quick & easy loading/unloading. Ordered several as I notice pricing going up a bit. Would recommend these to anyone looking for speedloaders.
4,good book...narrow focus,"It was unclear to me that the book was focused exclusively on golf greens. I was looking for information on sod production. There is nonetheless a lot of useful information. It's just not exactly what I was looking for. There are some useful fungicide recommendations. Many authors don't make those, recommending instead that you consult the extension service. The chapters on diseases, pests, and weeds is thorough."
3,Much needed help for Zoners,"A fairly balanced cookbook, with helpful hints in the front for maintaining a zone diet. However, many of the recipes and suggestions rely heavily on high glycemic carbs, not necessarily the best for someone who is trying to stay on the diet without hunger. A beautiful salmon recipe recommends a small baked potato as accompaniment. A better suggestion would be a cup of steamed broccoli and a cup of strawberries. If you are new to the Zone, beware!"
4,Very nice blanket,"I used for Queen platform bed and its perfect.Good size, but a little small for my King platform bed.Thin, good for summer etc.Looks nice, good quality, good color."
2,Xtremely hard to get iPod in or out,"This case looks great, stands the punishment but when coming to taking the iPod out of it, it is incredibly difficult. You will need help from someone to pull the case while you use some sort of rubber or wooden stick to push the iPod out of the casing.If you don't want to take the iPod out of the case EVER, then buy it. It is a great protection. But if you want to use any docking port, forget about this piece."
4,Great Case,"Fits my 40G 4th Gen ""classic"" (or ""click wheel"") Perfectly!Great case, easy to use...only holdback for my hubby was he has to open the top to access the Hold button, otherwise everything else is awesome.Love that it has a clip for you and your car :)"
1,product received tarnished,I was very unhappy with this product. I purchased a few for teacher's gifts. They all came tarnished. I do not live in the U.S. and so it makes no sense for me to spend money to send back. Very disappointed !!!
2,Disappointing,"Despite finding quite a lot to relate to in the first quarter of this book, I was rather disappointed on the whole - it just didn't feel like it had much substance. The author includes lots of self-penned poems or creative musings about his experiences which I think are far too personal (and verging on cringe-worthy) to be of much - if any - value to the reader. He also includes a lot of quotations from everyday folk and famous people on the subject of 'motherloss', and while some are interesting, helpful and/or meaningful, many aren't. The sheer number of poems and quotations struck me as a page filling device in what is a fairly slight book. However, it's obviously popular with many reviewers, so perhaps it just wasn't what I was hoping for as a tool to help me deal with the loss of my mother."
1,Not helpful,"I did not find this book helpful at all. It contained many stories by the author and others of sentimental value and about the decline of their mother's health. Many of us know what it is like sitting at the bedside in a hospital waiting for that moment of death yet hoping and praying it doesn't happen. What I would have found more useful is to know what I could expect in the days and weeks and months to follow. In fairness to the author, grieving is such a personal experience there could be no real way to convey the process in a manner that you could emotionally relate to it. Each one of us experiences grief differently."
4,Painful Loss,This book certainly helped me to realize I certainly am not the first (and won't be the last) to struggle with grief and mourning after the loss of Mom. I am going to pass this book on to my siblings.
3,Grieving the Death of a Mother,This book definitely touches home on a lot of issues that you face during the loss of your mother regardless of your age.
2,Grieving the Death of a Mother,"I am really disappointed in this book. I am trying to finish it and keep hoping that each new chapter will be uplifting for me. I am more disappointed and depressed with each chapter that I read. I am constantly looking for signs that my mom is ok, and signs that she is watching me and loves me and there are none. I wish I had not bought this book. It is not what I needed to help me survive the death of my best friend. What about those daughters who do not see feathers, or jars in the road or hummingbirds? Are their moms not out there watching them and aren't these moms ok and don't they love their daughters?"
3,Disappointed Read,"It's ok, my expectations were pretty high after reading the reviews. Not sure I would recommend this book to anyone dealing with the recent loss of a mother."
2,under average film on a bad quality dvd,"To be clear, I'm talking about the EU version of the dvd but I hear it's just the same as the US, being region free. The film is nice to watch once, a vhs tape will perfectly do. It doesn't add anything new to Marilyn's story, it doesn't present events in a revealing perspective. The footage is ordinary and often very short. It's nice to have/see it as a recap of this woman's life. The Kennedy story is mentioned in about 10 seconds plus the Happy B'day Mr President footage (which is about 20 secs.). The dvd transfer is poor, the colour episodes are phoney but the b/w will do. There's absolutely no extra and if someone still thinks ""scene access"" is extra, the music cd business should also call the cd-s ""enhanced"" because they have a 4 page booklet or you can choose the songs you want to listen to. Pleeease!"
5,Harry's Review,Fragments That Remain is one of the most pleasurable books I have ever read. Steven Corbin does an incredible job fleshing out his characters. The characters come alive with each page. I was able to identify with Corbins's characters due to the richness of his writing. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning the intricacies involved in a gay interracial relationship. It's an eye opener.
3,Why does the Eagles Uke tracks play here?,"I was trying to listen to these Dead interpretations, but the audio tracks are playing the Eagles Uke Summit CD tracks. Whassup with that?"
1,How did this get published,"Oh Dear. There is a reason I don't read chic-lit, and this has yet again confirmed it - lack of a thought-out plot, paper thin characterisation, air-head prose, unbelievability, obvious man is stupid young woman is always best syndrome. The only good thing about this is if this sort of thing gets published, there is hope for better quality stuff trying to get a publisher."
3,A DAY AT THE MOVIES,GOOD CD DORIS SINGS WELL AND SHE DOES SOME OF HER BEST SONGS. THOUGHT THE SOUNDTRACK WASN'T UP TO PAR THOUGH. CUTE SONGS.
5,Endearing Collection from John Barry's Early Films,"This is a very good collection of John Barry's film music from the 1960's. Besides the various James Bond film themes, impressive selections such as THE IPCRESS FILE, KING RAT and THE CHASE are included. ""Wednesday's Child"" from the QUILLER MEMORANDUM is very good. There is not a bad cut in the bunch."
5,"Wonerful,wonderful, wonderful.","Description of product accurate as advertised. Arrived very quickly and was loaded within hours ! We enjoyed putting this together, but found all the paintings a bit too challenging, or kind of boring for our younger groups. Nevertheless, it was fun on each level and hope this company produces more. Also w/ like it to be more reasonably priced for families to afford."
4,Not what I expected,After reading the reviews and having heard track 8 I was very excited to find and purchase this album... and while I do like it... I honestly don't find the music calming. There is a little to much of something that I can't quite put my finger on... one reviewer was right.. this work is hard to categorize in one genre.. .I felt New age and their is some nature and even some overtones of Enigma with the vocal arrangements on a few of the tracks. Overall a solid work but not as impressive as I hoped!!!
5,Could Not Put This Book Down,"You have heard people say that before. It has happened to me about 3 times in my reading life thus far and this is one of them. I was fascinated about the true life stories of how nutritional supplements helped people live healther and longer lives in spite of the fact they were facing life-threatening illnesses. As we get older, I assure you that we can relate to a lot of the case histories given in the book but until now, I had no idea of how nutritional supplements to your diet could not only help eliminate what ails you, they can also help you achieve more from your life. I would strongly suggest that you consider reading a very good companion book entitled ""Food, Mood and Money"" that discusses the same subject but adds considerably to it."
5,A must read book for all health care professionals,"This book is absolutely right on the mark about nutrition being the basis of disease. I see it over and over and have experienced it in my own life. This book has changed my own health and the health of many of my patients. I strongly recommend it for anyone wanting to live a better quality of life for a longer period of time. Life isn't just about living longer; it is about living longer with better quality.Pam King-Hester, CNM,ND"
5,I love this book,"If you care about your health at ALL, this book is a must read. And it isn't all technical - it is interesting! It's easy to understand and it teaches you so much about so many things!! I have changed my way of life for the better and plan to keep on learning more!"
3,Buy Vitamins,When reading his books you have to keep in mind that he is trying to sell you vitamins. Most likely if someone gave you this book that they get you involved in the MLM business.What I don't like is that all his books are geared to convincing you of the need for (his) vitamins.It doesn't mean that his material is bad just that you have to bear this in mind.
4,very comfortable,This brush is really comfortable. One star off because the fine bristles are not natural boar bristles but a synthetic material (boar and nylon blend). It is not as effective as a natural boar brush in distributing the oils in the hair. Overall a great brush.
3,HKS Speedloader case,"Case is ok for everyday carrying of speedloaders,for concealed carried hangs a bit low and can use a bit of plastic to keep it from hanging down.The velcro is ok, but needs to be watched, as it would be on any items using velcro. I would not advise it as a piece of equipment for a duty belt or law enforcement equipment. Good price for a ok item."
2,Speedloader Cordura Case,I was dissapointed with this product.This case is not as accomodating for speedloaders as the leather speedloader cases. I had to force the speedloader into this case. Also I feel this product was over priced for shipping .I've paid this amount of shipping for heavier products .Over all this was not a good shopping experience!
3,case fit,case fit is to tight for the 44 mag speed loaders the speed loaders are tough to get into the case
4,Buzz,Inexpensive and well-made. I bought two and have no complaints. They are flexible and even have room for larger speedloaders if desired.
3,Decent.,"It's a good item. The material is just a bit thin. I wouldn't take it anywhere it would see abuse, but for short trips to the range, it's good."
2,A little musty,"I had a sampler bottle of this cologne and my wife loved it on me. This bottle, maybe because its bigger, or a spray, or whatever - it doesn't do the same thing for her. I wont buy it again"
3,"Only the Characters Are ""Blinded""","This was the first time I've read a Stephen White novel. Although well-written and mildly entertaining (good for killing time while in airports), I was somewhat put-off by the fact that anyone who reads novels like this could guess the coming ""twist"" ending early on in the process. The only ones who couldn't see it coming were the supposedly smart lead characters in the book itself, a psychologist and a police detective."
3,Ok book,Haven't read this author before book was ok I guess not anything I would probably read again kind of disappointing not the kind of thrillers I like to read
2,Ridiculous Book,"White has reached the point that many writers do who write about the same characters book after book. The Alan Gregory books have run their course. You can tell this because each book becomes more ridiculous. Obviously, the author is writing only to fulfill his contract. This book has a silly, predictible plot which is all over the map-- literally. Like most White books, this one starts off good, but just gets sillier as it goes along. The plot is totally unrealistic, as are the actions of the characters. Even Detective Sam Purdy comes out looking like an idiot in this book -- which takes some doing. White needs to find a new protagonist and retire the increasingly annoying Dr. Alan Gregory."
4,I wasn't 'blinded'!!!,"I very much admire White's style, tenacity and attention to detail --especially in the unique development of characters in his offerings; however, it was obvious early on in BLINDED that the husband of the twisted duo was NOT a serial killer as purported by his wife during their bizarre 'sessions'. It was obvious, to me at least,that she was doing the killing!An excellent read, nonetheless. I am looking forward to THE SIEGE ...due out in August, 2009."
3,OKAY (ish),"This mystery was, for me, just - okay.Psychologist Alan Gregory has to have the most interesting, bizarre, and dangerous clients that any health professional has ever had in one lifetime. This time his most troubling patient is a stunningly beautiful women who tells Dr. Gregory that she knows that her husband has murdered one of their friends, and she is pretty sure that he has murdered other women as well. And of course, she needs Dr. Gregory's help.The subplots: Alan's friend Sam has a heart attack and his marriage is breaking apart. His wife is home sick with MS for most of the book. His daughter is a typical toddler.Many other reviewers have already mentioned that the conclusion was easily predictable and I'd have to agree.Not a bad book, but not a real fun one either."
3,Not bad...,"This book wasn't a bad read, it kept me turning pages until I was done. However, you pretty much know WHO the murderer is going to turn out to be within the first 5 pages of the book. My suspense in getting to the end was to see if I was right or not.I would recommend this to anyone needing a quick read, but one that isn't too thought provoking. By contrast, it takes alot of brain power to read Dan Brown, not so much with this one."
3,Look at a map...please!,"The book was good and kept me reading until the very end, but I was disappointed by an obvious error. When going from Georgia to Indiana via Louisville, Sam wouldn't be anywhere near Columbus,Ohio and Route 65 doesn't even go through Ohio!"
3,3 1/2 stars,"See storyline above.Though White creates great depth with his characters and you get to know what they're feeling emotionally, this novel did'nt have the energy or vigor that I have come to expect. It was a little bit of a struggle to get through, but when I reached the end, I decided it wasn't such a bad book. Stephen White fans will see this as an average effort from the author."
3,not the best,"I read all of the Alan Gregory novels, and have to say this one was a disappointment. It is painless reading, but also, I think, too superficial. There is not enough depth to the plot or the character interactions. I feel as though, instead of using each book to add depth to his characters, White is relying on us knowing them from the prior books. I find this unsatisfying. Still, it was not a BAD book, just too short and lazy."
1,????,"Nope. These characters all trying to have a deep sense of irony and sarcasm as if they were New Yorkers. I pictured them all talking out of the sides of their mouths like ""The Frog"". There was also too much talk about sex, stupid sex fantasies, swinging, and obsessions about what people look like. Shallow and boring."
4,Blinded,"Another hit from Stephen White. Would suggest reading his books in the order they were written. However, if you just jump in you'll pick up quickly who is who. One of my most favorite authors. The ending is ALWAYS a surprise."
2,Disappointingly predictible,"What a disappointment! If you don't have this one figured out by the end of the first few chapters, maybe you should try shopping in the young adult section. I liked the characters, so I keep hoping that the ending wouldn't be as obvious as it seemed to be. Unfortunately, it was."
3,Not as listed double key NO Knob,"This product is listed as key outside, knob inside but is actually keyed inside and outside with no knob."
3,my opinion,iam not very much satisfied with the content on the page i just want to know about hte internal architecture of 8086 processor i had never found it and i want to know about the assembly programming
3,"Don't kill this one without listening to ""Nobody Kills Me""","Only album (that I'm aware of) by this obscure 80s R&B group. Not a lot to recommend it, but worth finding for the funky song ""Nobody Kills Me"" which has more of an ""old-school 80s"" sound than anything else on the album."
4,A thorough overview of NT studies in the historical-critical era,"This books offers an impressive synopsis of how scholars have interpreted the NT since the emergence of the historical-critical school of thought. Neill covers the pertinent names, places and ideas that have contributed to the field of study over the past 150 years. Neill's style is readable, though not especailly fluid. His scholarship and attention to detail are impeccable. If you are hungry for an intial walk-through of modern NT scholarship, this book is the perfect place to begin and will answer most of your questions. Highly recommended."
3,A hip pocket version of the movie,"So, your enjoyment will depend on if you're a Howard fan or not...the book bears no more semblance to Howard's original short stories (other than the occasional scene taken from Hoawrd's works) than does the movie, but that's the point.The book is actually very, very close to the movie...a few little differences thrown in here and there that literally could have been in the movie, for that matter. The plot, theme, characters, locations are the same.Overall, an enjoyable book if you like the barbarian hack-n-slash. If you're looking for in-depth character and plot development, you'll be disappointed."
2,Super Reader,"This is the novelisation of the first movie with Ah-Nuld, and stays pretty tightly within those confines, and as such, is reasonably short. Conan's parents are killed, he becomes slave, gladiator and thief, and once free, sets out to treck down Thulsa Doom, the leader that had his parents killed.He gains and loses allies along the way."
4,Original and far superior Viper,"This is the original late 70's series Viper, which I consider to be far superior in looks and interest from the re-make. I had one of these as a kid but did not have the patience to put any real detail into it so when I saw this one I had to get it. I did not pay more than $25 for mine and do not understand why it is now listed at almost $90 when $25- $30 models are still out there at hobby shops. This was a pretty good model, no problems with any of the parts coming together and some decent degree of detail. Would have been nicer if it had come with a lighting set or at least some suggestions on how to light it beings the instructions suggest that you do. Would have given it a 5 if it had included the lights."
3,"Big and Impressive looking, but hollow inside","The book is big and looks quite impressive, but the contents are rather indifferent. The problem is that it seeks to address too many different areas--technological development, history, strategy, organization, ships, leading naval personalities--for such a long period that nothing is covered in a thorough or comprehensive fashion that a more specialized book might. Rather, everything gets rather bland, hackneyed treatment rather than an in-depth analysis or exposition. Still, if you want a reasonably detailed book that provides a good overview of the Imperial Japanese Navy from its modern inception after the Meiji Restoration to the begining of the Second World War, you might find it rather valuable."
4,A Wonderful Balance,"Kaigun sets the stage of the Pacific war and essentially ends when the curtain rises in December of 1941 . It provides the context required to understand the actions of Japanese commanders and their weapons during subsequent naval battles .The book is a wonderful blend of doctrinal and technical development . One is left with a clear understanding of advancements in technology and how they would be utilized in a naval conflict . The Japanese view of America as it's potential foe was extremely significant and can be seen as the dangers of a ""self fulfilling prophecy"" .I loved the technical history and found it to be comprehensive without getting mired in too much depth or detail . A very readable book that is a vital resource to any fan of naval history in general or the Imperial Japanese Navy in particular ."
4,"Very readable description of development of IJN strategy, tactics and technology...","This book is full of interesting informations and covers the not-so-well-covered chapter of IJN. There are some small inaccuracies in ship description (for example Kamikaze class destroyers are counted as Minekaze class) but the main contribution of this book is description of development of strategy, tactics and technology wich was suposed to defeat US Navy."
4,Imperial Japanese Navy Strategy Many Years Before Pearl Harbor,"If you're interested in how the Japanese Navy's plan to defend the Empire when the U.S. Great White Fleet steamed into the Pacific, then this is a must-read book. Excellent discussion of both strategy and tactics that were in place decades prior to the attack on the U.S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor."
4,Fascinating overview,"This was a very enjoyable read. The author's writing style made it flow very smoothly and it wasn't a chore. Another aspect of the book that made it so good was how the author seamlessly transitioned between the three levels of war and described how each level impacted the other. The most significant portions of the book were on the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, and the author does an outstanding job in showing how these experiences significantly impacted the IJN up to the attack on Pearl Harbor, which mirrored the attack on Port Arthur in so many ways. The development of improved torpedo design and improved naval design of battleships and aircraft carriers was shown to play a significant role in the development strategy, and the author demonstrated its impact on IJN operations in the late 30s and early 40s. Overall an excellent book which shows the enduring influence of Corbett and Mahan."
3,"Adequate Pump, gets the job done",its a great pump but would be nice to have a guage for the air pressure
4,Stanley is Bird-Bonkers,The book is great. Like the show that airs on Disney - wonderful information on many different types of birds. It is geared for pre-school aged kids. Yet still intertaining for parents to read. The Interactive CD-ROM is just simple things. I think my daughter expected more. She has the new Stanley's Tiger-Tales CD-ROM Game and she was expecting this CD to be much more than it is - more like the Tiger-Tales game. The game on this CD is tricky - I haven't been able to win it yet.
4,Replacement,"The Adcom GFP-715 sounds good to me. I have an Adcom GFA-545 amplifier and Martin Logan Clarity speakers. When my right channel stopped working on my Adcom GTP-400, I sent it to a place for repair. After spending $150 the repair only lasted a month. I decided to go without a tuner and buy the GFP-715.I am happy with the listening to the stereo reproduction of musical performances. Although I have found audio cables can make a big difference(kind of off the subject). I put together some mu metal audio cables and they make a definite difference in listening to a piece of music.So from someone who would spend the extra effort to make his own audio cables, but obviously cannot afford the high end stuff, the GFP-715 is a good preamp."
1,A HALF-BAKED REWRITE OF MARI SANDOZ'S BOOK,"The Author says he was inspired from Mari Sandoz's book on Crazy Horse which is all fine and good but this has to be considered fiction--yet it is constantly cataloged as non-fiction. Please, researching this era is already tough enough. If you want a good book on Crazy Horse get Mari Sandoz's and if you want to balance another opinion on it get Larry McMurtry's book--who is critical of Sandoz. But if you still want to get it, you've been warned."
3,Where the stuff for middle-aged travelers?,"Though I give this only three stars let me say this is a good guide but lacks in two aspects. One is that it is so cumbersome to carry around. I can see if you are going to be traveling all over Mexico then you cannot help but carry the one bulky volume. But if you are just concentrating on one area, like Central Mexico, you really do not need the rest of the volume. There needs to be a Central Mexican guide--smaller and more compact.Second is that the guide is really geared toward a certain class of travelers. The middle-class, middle aged traveler doesn't find much useful geared toward them. I have heard this complaint over and over again from the tourists here in Guanajuato that I interview.Doug BowerAuthor, THE PLAIN TRUTH ABOUT LIVING IN MEXICO"
4,a good guide,"I am living in mexico now and working and have a two year contract. Living here, I take advantage of going around Mexico during my holidays at work. I always take this book with me around and traveled around Mexico. This book was very helpful to me and telling me where to go. However, it is good to note, sometimes if you are looking for mid range to high end hotels in big cities (Mexico City, Monterrey, Acapulco, ect..), it is better to make reservations via the internet. But smaller cities like Durango, Zacatecas or Torreon, LP is very helpful and truth to what it mentions. Reserving through the internet, you can also see what it mentions in LP to compare, which is very helpful."
5,I am Mexican and I love it,"Thank God I learned English because we Mexicans don't have a better book than this in Spanish. I love traveling in my country and this is my second Lonely Planet guide to Mexico, since the first was a little outdated and worn out. I would like to see this book translated to Spanish readers for the benefit of Mexico and themselves. By the way, I also bought the Frommer's guide, but I found it severely prejudiced and focused in superficial travelers. Lonely Planet's guide is an invitation to mix with the locals and we like foreigners. Strongly recommended"
5,always recommend Lonely Planet,"I will always recommend the Lonely Planet books. This one in particular got us all over Mexico City, Veracruz and everywhere in-between with great recommendations on restaurants and hostels that felt like actual hotels."
3,Maps need improving!,"With each edition of Lonely Planet Mexico, we find that the city maps are getting more difficult to read. Print is tinier and what used to be clearly printed black roads are pale lines. It's true that the majority of world travelers are people over 50 - but I would think that even younger travelers would appreciate easy-to-read maps."
3,Decent,"I got this CD about year ago from sandoxautomatic because it had El Da Sensei on it plus it was like 7 bucks and came with a poster. I gotta say Richy is in my opinion a medicore producer. The J-Live song was previously released, its short, the El Da Sensei joint was so so. i'm not gonna say this CD is total garbage, but try to find it used if you can, because personally I feel like I enjoyed the poster I got free more than the CD itself."
3,very 1-dimensional,"This information is a bit outdated. Evidence is emerging that females may indeed have AS as frequently as males, but it goes undetected due to females' early-learned coping skills. To get a more living, breathing idea of AS, I recommend a book about females with AS -- most notably Tony Attwood and Rudy Simone (Aspergirls).This style writing sucks the life out of the people he's discussing, and lays them out on a petrie dish for poking and prodding. Not helpful for people who would give anything to be seen as people rather than a pathology."
4,From the ? inside,"On the jacket, Sally J Rogers, Ph D states, ""...........Adults with AS and parents of children with AS will find it a veritable encyclopedia............."". I certainly agree with this statement, but would add some qualifying remarks. It is undoubtedly intended as a detailed text for scholars and specialists in Psychiatry and Psychology who are fully versed in scientific investigatory techniques, and lay readers including even many with good levels of general education, will find reading it a daunting task. However, dogged persistence may well be very rewarding. For those general readers who wish to gain some insight into what has become known as Asperger Syndrome, I would recommend that they first read less demanding texts in order to obtain some general grounding in the subject - such as 'Asperger's Syndrome' by Dr Tony Attwood."
2,"Dull: no suspense, no thrill.","When I first met V.I. Warshawski in the pages of ""Guardian Angel"" I found incredible likenesses with Sue Grafton's heroine of her Alphabet series. And by the end, I was equally annoyed and bored by her dull exposition and smarty-pants comments that were just not funny. I would have liked more thought in presenting some clues (we were presented with answers instead of clues that rolled out for us to piece together with the detective) than all the endless droning about cranky neighbors, jerky ex-husbands, pregnant dogs and worn-out running shoes.I found myself annoyed with myself halfway through for bothering to finish ""Guardian Angel"" because I honestly, could not have cared less about what happened."
4,One of the Best So Far!,"This is one of the best in the series! In the 7th installment V. I. Warshawski, Chicago's PI, Vic becomes involved with her neighborhood. An old friend of Mr. Contreras is in trouble and then missing. The neighborhood has its own problems with new neighbors complaining and harassing the neighbors who have been around for many years. It includes more details on her ex-husband, a new love interest and a strained old friendship."
4,one of her better,"One of her better ones in the VI Warshawski series. More dense, character driven. Yes, the author could have provided more clues and made the who/what/why ending a bit more exciting, punchy. But it's the ride and characters in this book that make it a strong read.Paul"
2,Ponderous and Bloated,"This book is indeed ""unprecedentedly detailed"", in fact, way too detailed. The author is weighed down by far too many details, and trips over them quite frequently. Instead of moving with the lightning speed of Napoleon, he slothfully crawls along like Kutuzov. There is absolutely no need, in the middle of the narrative on the battle of Austerlitz, to tell us the number of effectives in EVERY regiment in the French army, on the day of the crossing of the Rhine, at mid-point in the campaign, and on the day of battle itself. It shows that the author was a good little student, and did his homework, but it weighs down the story of the battle, and slows it to a crawl, and it's the battle itself that most of us want to read about. This is can't see the forest for the trees history. This book might do service as a reference work, but for a taut, exciting account of Austerlitz, pick up Ian Castle's book."
2,"Wargamers Croon, Historians Cringe","Mr. Bowden (while offering a good analysis of the Grande Armee in 1805), has done questionable research on both the armies of Russia and the Habsburg Dynasty. Without these components, it is impossible to write a meaningful account of Austerlitz and the actions that preceded it.This book is fare for wargaming hobbyists who primarily seek pictures, maps and orders of battle. For the scholarly enthusiast, a definitive work on 1805 has yet to be done."
5,A collector's must have!!!,"I'll be honest here, I'm a collector. I bought this CD to complete the catalog for this artist. The beats are hot and L.L.C.J. are just being themselves when they did this album."
3,The Great Quotations,It was not exactly what I expected. I thought it would be similar to Great Thoughts and found the content was not as useful. Many authors were unknown to me.
4,Lives of Children,"As when I first read this book 30 years ago, it is still the best explanation for why education works or doesn't work. And it is very well written -- and very touching! It reaches one's soul."
2,costume not as pictured.,"This Chewbacca costume did not arrive like it was advertised. We ordered this one because it showed a picture of a realistic-looking furry Chewbacca head, and instead, the costume came with a latex mask. It is ""Disney"" brand, and the jump suit looks like good quality, but we are dissapointed in the false representation in the picture on the website.Star Wars: Chewbacca Deluxe Child Costume - Medium"
4,Night to Remember - Cyndi Lauper,"It takes a few listens but I love it! And it is a perfect break-up album; there is; ""my first night without you"" but even better for sore-hearts is; ""I don't want to be your friend"". For anyone who's ever been through heart-ache this song is perfect! Mind you there is also songs for those in-love; ""Unconditional Love"" took me a few listens but it's great. And on first listen to ""Like A Cat"" I thought is was the most ridiculous song ever written, but it's quite cat-chy and now I love it! Overall this album, while not being as good as 'She's So Unusual' or 'Hat Full of Stars' is way better than 'Sister's of Avalon' and has a carefree attitude to it, which is what we all love of Cyndi!"
3,For the serious Alice Cooper fan only.,"The really good thing about this disc is the selection of songs covered. It could have been limited to his ""hits"", but these bands pulled out a few of the more obscure titles. The performance of the songs are another matter. While some of the covers are actually pretty cool, others seemed like they were not taking them seriously. I did not know any of the bands doing this cd so I wasn't sure what to expect. Most of the music is kind of heavy in a post punk sense. An interesting addition for the serious Alice Cooper collector only."
3,half & half,"First of all, diehard alice cooper fanatics will have some problems digesting this album. Fans of alterna-punk-noise pop will think the sun shines out of this album. The performances range from humorous to downright horrible. Flaming lips easily steal the show with a drugged out version of sun arise but as far as i'm concerned, that's really the only cool thing on the disc! to be perfectly frank, this disc was a unnecessary attempt at making money! So please don't waste your money!"
1,New XBOX 360 owners beware.,If you have a newer Xbox 360 This Cooling fan Will Not work. It will go on the xbox 360 but the plug will not fit it.
3,Could have been more adapted,Looked like a good deal and im sure it is if you have the rite 360 model. It doesnt work with mine though.
2,running out of believable plots,"The British television industry has such an appetite for detective stories that the script writers are running out of quality, believable plots. This may not bother you if you view this series to enjoy the eccentric characters. Others will have to use their ""suspended disbelief"" mode of viewing to not get disappointed. Fans of the original Agatha Christie novels will be disappointed. One example of the disbelief being needed is when the police, the medical examiner, and Poirot fail to examine a crime scene and corpse for basic physical evidence, such as bruising, powder burns, and bullet trajectories, and jump to the wrong conclusion.This set of programs comes from the time when British television viewers started complaining that the BBC programming was being dumbed down."
4,Lovely,"This book is a short picture book of Hatsheput's Egyptian reign. She was Egypt's only successful female king. She wore men's clothing and a beard, and referred to herself as ""he"" as well as ""she."" Her rein was a peaceful and prosperous one. She explored lands and built beautiful, magnificent monuments and obelisks. Her masterpiece was the temple at the site known today as Deir-el-Bahri and archaeologists continue to study the amazing tale told on its walls.The book is nicely illustrated by artist renderings that capture the atmosphere of the time. A good book for children and adults."
1,Terrible Customer Service!,"The chocolate arrived severely damaged and melted. Seller did a poor job of packaging it, using a thin cardboard box and a handful of packaging peanuts. This caused the chocolate to come into direct contact with the box and therefore exposed to whatever temperature it touched. I immediately contact the seller via telephone and was told it was not their problem and I should just use the melted chocolate (?!) I explained its purpose was for baking in cookies as chips, not melting, but regardless think it is disgusting to be told to use a damaged food product. I explained companies around the world are able to package and ship chocolate and have it arrive at its destination without melting. The customer should not be forced to accept a damaged, unusable product.A few emails back and forth and the seller refuses to replace the damaged product and told me to return it to them at my expense plus additional fees if I chose. Terrible customer service!"
2,Just okay...,"I didn't care for this author's style of writing. The story didn't flow in my opinion because of how many references she used. It's like her actual story could have been written in one chapter, but in order to make it long enough to publish, she added reference after reference and other people's ideas and writings. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one, is because I feel that what she experienced is true and she is sharing truth. Other than that, nothing new and it seriously could've been written in one chapter. So disappointing - especially since I spent $13 to read it... Bug."
1,The Other Side Of Death,"This was the biggest waste of money and the very worst book I have ever read!!! Obviously, this woman (Jan Price, the author) does not believe in or has never read the ""Holy Bible"". The junk she writes about is more demonic than anything. Sounds like someone on drugs. She speaks of her 1 day old baby that died. However, in this so-called place that she claims she went to, in her NDE, she never once mentions seeing her baby, yet she says she saw firends and family, and even her little doggy. But why not her baby? She also mentions in this book 3 different times how pretty and beautiful she thinks she is. How conceited! And I couldn't tell you how many times she claims she has been reincarnated. What a dreamer! Actually this book, in my opinion is a nightmare. Trust me....Don't waste your time or money."
4,"Moving Story of Courage, Conscience and Faith","I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who views morality, not as a series of rules to be followed, but rather as a matter of conscience that requires difficult choices . The acting and filming were well done, but the message was most powerful."
2,Book vs. Movie,"I guess my mistake was I read the book on which this movie is based. Since it differs in every aspect from the book, I wonder why they just didn't make a movie about the priests in Dachau. Even the title is wrong, as the priest was given a 10 day leave to attend his mother's funeral. And what made it incredible is the fact that the priest did return to Dachau in 10 days. But that was just an isolated incident in the book. Ulrich Mathes was okay, but this portrayal pales in comparison to his excellent portrayal of Joseph Goebbels in ""Downfall"". (And how could anyone confuse him with Ben Cross-who played Abrams in ""Chariots of Fire""?) Not worth the money; not worth the time."
4,Really sad movie,"The fellow who plays a Catholic Priest is the same guy who played Abrahms in Chariots of Fire. He is so thin, he looks like he is from the Camp."
4,"Cute outfit, but...","I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. I actually ended up returning this outfit, since the skirt is a bit too ""adult"" for my girl, and the top fits very oddly. I believe it would fit oddly on the Teen Trends dolls as well. It sort of makes the dolls look pregnant. I know this is a style, but I don't want my ten-year-old-looking doll to appear pregnant, thanks. Very durable outfit, cute if that's your style, but it's too flashy, even for an expensive doll."
2,Likely an old tale,Evidence suggests that the old mine road is likely a fable rather than a historical fact as this book assumes. The book gives some local color but that information is available on the Web.
4,Lets see............,"The album like any other R&B album has the power and soulful edge to it. The multi-platinum, Unleash The Dragon is an expressive listen. Sisqo, in collaboration, with some of the producers, Montell Jordan, Babyface and Dru Hill has created a pretty demonstrative album. The album features the smash hit single ""Thong Song"" and 12 other lively tracks. Overall, the album is pretty diverse album containing up-tempo songs, pop ballads, slow drag songs etc. Unleash The Dragon is probably a good listen."
4,Great product,"I'm using a Mac on OS X and this drive was 'plug and play' for me and I've had no problems at all so far (4 months later). It's quite fast and quiet, has a nice colorful design and is competitively priced so it has suited all of my needs."
2,"Performance fine, but not sturdy!","The hard drive worked fine, and I appreciated its funky aesthetic. However, it's not the smallest or lightest box in the world so it does take up space for those that will be taking their external hard drive/s with them often. Also, I found its occasional humming during use noticeable, if not particularly loud. My one major gripe is that it's not nearly the sturdiest of machines. I took it with me when I moved countries and it didn't seem to make the journey, though I took it in carry-on and don't believe it was treated particularly abrasively. It has a spinning drive piece that has broken, rendering the hard drive useless and the information saved on it inaccessible. Now, I have to try and figure out how to extract the data from the drive. I've been told that such parts are common in externals, but I would recommend purchasing a ""rugged"" design model if you will take yours traveling."
4,Nice to wear while running but the pocket isn't very great,"This pair of gloves keep your hands warm while running in cold windy weather. If you like to run in cold weather, this pair is for you.However, I found the pocket useless. It is too small to put anything into."
3,Very dense,"I have read many many translations of the Mahabharata. This was the first one that I could not make it through. The translation was so dense and wordy. I ended up giving it to my mom who had a much higher understanding of the Mahabharata, and was able to read through it and enjoy it. Let's just say I would not purchase this as an intro book to the Mahabharata."
3,ITS OK,"IF YOU ARE STARTING IN MAGIC,READ IT.IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT OLD IN THE PROFESSION,MOST OF THE STUFF YOU WILL FIND ARE KNOWN AND VERY INTELLECTUAL,THOUGH NOT PRACTICAL..."
1,"The most pompous, least useful magical study ever ever.","I've had only two reactions from this book: falling asleep or laughing. Repressed Regardie is far from my favorite author, or any useful author in particular; I've only found his works, ""The Golden Dawn"" and ""A Garden of Pomegranates"" to be mildly useful. ""Tree of Life"" seems to be one long, drawn-out, arrogant criticism of other practices, and indeed other magicians. The information is exceptionally watered-down and seemingly copied from his superiors in the Golden Dawn (namely, Aliester Crowley, who is a ""lesser"" to him). Armchair magicians don't have much purpose in general, and Regardie certainly falls easily into that category!"
1,Need a damn dictionary to understand every 4th word,"Aww man this damn book is so annoying to read, most people will need a dictionary on hand to understand this Crap this guy uses all these big words that really could have been broken down to simple terms, people that write like this are insecure jack A..es trying to convey to the world that they're intelligent, No if you were intelligent you would have used simple words to make the same point. These enormous words are not called for at all, especially when they mean something so simple, and also this guy has words in this book that even dictionary.com doesn't have lol like Nephesh.He has words in here like opprobrium which means shameful, puissant which means powerful, I mean this author is a moron man who is he trying to impress with his vast vocabulary, I'm not saying this book sucks but as far as a fun read it Sucks big time."
3,Great book but...,The book itself would be great and would easily deserve 5 stars (it is Regardie's Magnum Opus) if it was not stained by its footnotes and illustrations (both by the Cicero's). Poor Regardie! He does deserves better than that. To anyone reading this I can only recommand the following : buy an old edition of this book. ( I personnally have a copy edited By S. Weiser in 1969). This way you'll get the best of magick and escape the worse... This is what I did and I did well!
3,The tree of life Israel Regardie,"I've recently purchased this book and ""BOY it's a mouth full"". I'm at the 60th page and, I think I need mystical powers just to help me finish it! For every sentence I read, I need to decipher a couple of words.There's a review covering this book where the critic boasts the fact he read it in two day's. I'm sorry, but I think I need about two day's worth of reading of a dictionary and a thesaurus just to make sense of the ""unnecessary toughened vocabulary of this book"".Apart from that, the book seems philosophically enlightening."
3,Excessively wordy,"Please review portions of this book before buying it. While I'm sure the writers are able to write, the style of writing is excessively wordy filled with needlessly multisylabic adjectives. As a consequence, it is difficult to read not to mention understand. The writers have forgotten that meaning and information are lost when they are diluted with excessive words."
2,Good Technicals Not so hot Photos,This is an excellent book for those who wish to know the A-B-C of how to use an electronic flash in all manner of situations. The big minus is that it doesent give you any pointers on how to take appealing looking photographs. Nearly all of the sample pictures in the book are little better than posed snapshots and don't make you want to grab your camera and rush out the door like Brian Peterson's books do. If you want to compose good flash photos you have to combine the books of the two authors.
2,only for beginners,"I've had this book for several months, and have gone through it several times. I find that my initial reaction was correct: it really is not a very useful book. It may be good for someone with their first 35mm camera, but for anyone with even an intermediate knowledge of flash systems, I suggest you save your money. Perhaps the most telling example of the level that this book caters to, are the photos that McCartney uses to ilustrate the book. Except for a few of them, almost any amateur could produce photos as good or better."
5,A Clear and Straight Forward Presentation,"I bought this book, because it was refreshingly free of techno-babble. I found the pictures inspriring and, in some cases, amusing. Perhaps you shouldn't buy this book if you want to make photographs of weddings, babies and bar mitzvahs, but if you are striving to improve your flash photography on an artistic level, you should find this book a terrific help. I haven't reached the advanced level yet, but the book will take me there when I'm ready.Signed, Serious Amateur Photographer Long Island New York"
1,"Not a book you are looking for, if you are into digital photography","The book is outdated and a bit unorganized, with lot's of old stuff in it. I would not waste my time on it and therefore it went back on the shelf in a hurry, sorry."
3,Average flash information,"While the author provided a few flash pointers, most of the information in the book is common sense. No information on digital photography either. Definitely only for very novice beginners."
1,Product defective,"I am a long time supporter and user of Nikon products. I have several of their products including rifle scopes, rangefinders, and other binoculars. So, when I needed another pair of binoculars it was a easy choice. The monarchs have clear crisp picture even in low light, and for the cost you can't beat them. My issue with the 12X42 Monarchs that I just purchased is that one of the lense ring nuts was severly bent out of shape. I can't beleive that these binoculars passed inspection, unless the inspector was asleep or blind. I am highly disappointed in Nikon! I hope the warranty process goes smooth."
3,I know Jack,Hey Jack of all trades comes out on july 18 no special features though hence the three stars.
2,Very little value,"I found this book hand wavy and badly written. I learned almost nothing from it. The writing is very vague and confusing.The following stock valuation books are far better:1. ""Stock Valuation"" by Scott Hoover.2. ""Fire Your Stock Analyst: Analyzing Stocks On Your Own"" by Harry Domash."
2,Not a good effort for the Dickies,"I am a HUGE Dickie's fan and have been since 1981 or 1982. I grew up on Dawn of the Dickies and the Paramoid EP. I was hunting around for other Dickie's CDs because I liked what they did later on, especially the Stukas over Disneyland, the live ROIR cassette they had and Second Coming of the Dickies with that great cover of ""Hair."" Unfortunately Idjit Savant is not a good album. I guess every band, even one as great as the Dickies can have an off album, but this one is really disappointing. If you are trying to find one Dickies' CD to start off with, get the hits Great Dictations or Dawn of the Dickies."
4,Lo-Fi Humor,"If you're into lo-fi recordings of bored college students then you ought to find this entertaining.I don't think either of these guys had any illusions they were making inspiring music--but that's exactly why it is still listenable even though there isn't a whole lot here. At times it seems like they were trying to make each song sound as strange as they could. This isn't a Velvet Underground-like attempt to be annoying just because they could, it is more an attempt to show that as long as the people are enjoying making the music, it doesn't really matter what the end product is. There's an obvious flaw in that statement, and if you can't figure out what I meant by that then you probably should go buy something else. But if you're interested, download this record."
1,Tested positive for lead.,"This product tested positive for lead using theHomax 5250 Household Lead Test Kit. Since the product is called a set of ""Dipping Bowls"", it implies use for food. I'd test them yourself if you used them. Made in China. Go figure."
2,Husband was disappointed.,"Sadly, my husband said the book did not get down to the real nitty gitty regarding the fued. He was not interested in all the history of Kentucky and West Virginia. To many big words to filter through for just an old country boy. He felt like it could have been more in detail about what actually happened and not so many words just to fill the pages."
4,More travelogue than spiritual autobiography,"The subtitle of this work is ""The Autobiography of a Western Buddhist"". Unfortunately, that is not really an accurate description. The author, whether from humility or reticence, tells us little of his spiritual development and practice.Still, his life has been remarkable and he describes a spiritual world in China and Tibet that is gone forever and can only be vicariously experienced through books such as this.The author is a modest man, perhaps excessively so. I believe that he has left out much that would be of interest to his readers. The result is more a spiritual travelogue than a true spiritual autobiography. Yet, this book is so evocative that I am grateful to accept however much he is willing to share about his extraordinary experiences."
1,A completely worthless product,"This version is so incomplete, it is a total waste of money.1) Data entry is tedious. For periodic contributions (such as payroll deductions or church donations) there is no way to automatically enter them into the program.2) When adding non-cash contributions, you are reminded for every single entry if you go over the limits that require you to retain records.3) Adding details for non-cash contributions requires you to enter data that the IRS does not, and the date field in that box is badly designed.4) The only useful part of the program, value tables for common donated items, is woefully small.Its' competitor, ""It's Deductible"" is a far better program.Don't waste your money."
2,Worth the price (IF you get it for free),"This is a clunky program with a design that feels like freeware. If you buy a companion program like TaxCut DeLuxe that let's you get DeductionPro free after rebate, then it's worth the 37 cents postage you pay to process the rebate. The program's terrible, but the pre-programmed fair market values can save you time and money."
2,"Good information, but beware of noose!","I loved the fact that there is a children's book out there that contained all of my favorite works by Van Gogh, with text to support it, which can be read by my 7 year old. I don't know, perhaps I'm overprotective, but I didn't think one of the cartoons, showing a stick figure of ""Mr. Van Gogh"" in a NOOSE was appropriate for my son! (The context was that his students drew it....still, inappropriate! If a student would draw that on any chalkboard in any school district, they would probably be expelled!) I am planning on saving this book, for when he is older, and am looking for a replacement van gogh book for now, with only prints of his masterpieces!"
2,Battery life bad,"For brightness, this is a very nice light. The problem I have with this light is the battery life is very short. It lasts only about a 1/2 hour when on at full strength and then kicks back lumens. It also gets very warm. I am comparing this light to a Streamlight for about 1/3 the cost that last about triple the length and doesn't get warm. This is a nice light if you don't need it for a long time and don't mind buying several batteries."
5,Ralph is the Man,"This was the best book I ever read.A book about ralph when a boy named Ryan breaks Ralphs motorcycle.Beverly Cleary is the best author.Also read books about Henry,Ramona,Leigh,Ralph and more READ THIS BOOK NOW"
2,It's A Sad Sad Sad Sad Sad Book (Not 1963 comedy),This is a sad book. It tragically falls like no Beverly Cleary book ever made. Ralph's motorcycle breaks. Two words describe this book: CURSE BRAD!!!!!!!
2,too basic,"Might be good for learning add, subtract, multiply and divide, but I can already do those. I wanted to understand percentages, averages and discounts, and didn't find this book provided a good explanation for me. The examples were ok but the explanations didn't make sense. I found another book from the library that helped better."
4,Paella spoon,Great spoon in general. No very strong and bends easier than I would like when stirring. Love the length for stirring when cooking on the grill
2,Difficult to clean and dry,"The tiny fill hole makes this difficult to clean and dry.Haven't found a brush to fit inside the fill hole and still reach all the surfaces.Without scrubbing, detergent alone will not remove a slimy film that may grow if bag is left filled over time.The difficulty with throughly drying in a reasonable amount of time may lead to mold. Although it has eventually dried over several days and no mold formed, it did take sticking rods inside to keep it expanded.It needs a large enough fill hole to stick a hand through, like the new hydration packs out there. It would be much easier to clean and dry if it had a large fill hole.When it is clean, it has many uses:Shower (as designed)Float bag for a kayak (inflated with air)Emergency water storage"
3,Works Alright,The product works fine. When full the bag becomes very heavy which can be difficult if you want to hang it somewhere. The water flow is minimal. If you want to be able to rinse off or clean up a bit it works fine but I would not want to take a full shower with it. It does hold plenty of water and seems like reasonable quality materials.
1,Amazon sent one full of holes!!!,"I love this shower and wanted a new one so bought one. Unfortunately did NOT find out it had 9 holes until I needed it. By the time I got home from my vacation, the ""return window had expired"".So, if you buy one of these from Amazon, check it out right away for holes and punctures. I didn't and am stuck with a dud!"
2,Three times is the charms :/,"And ladies and gents thats all she wrote, i prettty only got thress uses out this horrible product, sure it heats up like it says on the box and the spiket works fine and all but the connecting hose running from the bag that is the weak spot of the whole thing three uses later and the glue or whatever they used is wearing out leaking profusly, please if you buy this dont exexpect it to be a long term item."
3,"It's okay, but the movie is better.","This compilation of short stories isn't bad, but it isn't good either. I get the feeling that the author read a lot of other sci-fi authors and tried emulating their work, but a lot of the stories felt flat and unimaginative. There are a few gems in this, ""Roller Ball Murder"" and ""Nirvana, Gotterdammerung, and the Shot Put"" being the ones that stood out the most for me. Wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance for a do-over, but probably would check it out of the library."
2,See the movie,"Rollerball is a collection of short stories by the author William Harrison. After reading this book, the only story that really stood out for me was ""Roller Ball Murder"" which the movie Rollerball was based on. The movie is fairly true to the short story but is only 15 pages long and really only touches on part of what the movie was about. I found all of the other stories fairly dry and uninteresting and reading this will add nothing to what the original movie had."
4,Confidence,Everything you need to know including how to speak basic Chinese. I will go to China with a feeling of confidence.
3,Tries to do too much...,"China is such a massive country with a rich culture that it is a formidable task to really explore it in one book, even if it is very thick! I used this during a 2 week trip to Eastern China and found that many of the sights that we really enjoyed and seemed to attract a fair amount of tourists were really shafted in this guide book. Maps of the subway system was useful to have, but the stations themselves are very well marked. Really didn't use this as much as I have used my LP books on trips in the past."
2,dissappointed,"I was excited to get this book since i'll be teaching in Wuhan China this year. I didn't have a chance to read or even really look at it before coming - i just threw it in my suitcase. Well, i got here and found out that the section for Wuhan and Hubei province did not print! The pages are blank or else there is only half a page. I was so dissappointed. This is my first Lonely Planet book, and it may be my last."
4,Lonely Planet China : too large for details,"China is too big and changing too fast to be anything but a blur. The only permanent objects are architectural. So the book concentrates on these and there are so many to cover that it has sacrificed detail of lodging, food and entertainment to be found elsewhere in the series. The book lacks detail. It should be four books. Nobody is going to carry around a set of encyclopedias in their rucksack. As it is, it may be too heavy to lug around. Few tourists see more than one or two parts of China.As to the usual good schedules, weather, basic language and and precautions, the book is well-organized and concise. They've done a fair job with an impossible task."
4,The best live album ever,"This MOFI release is good, but the Rhino release is better. The Rhino has a bit more dynamic sound and sounds more live. The MOFI sounds a bit more flat and a bit more dull.The music is just amazing, the playing by Feat is nothing short of breathtaking. For me this is the best live album ever, but for the best sound-buy the Rhino cd."
5,Little Feat in their finest hour,"In 1977 a friend of mine was playing this cassette in his car and I was instantly hooked! On New Year's Eve 1978 I had the pleasure of seeing Lowell & the band play and I've never looked back. I've worn out two cassettes of this album and recently bought the cd. The only thing missing is Don't Bogart that Joint/Apolitcal Blues! This is by far my favorite live album of all time. RIP Lowell George, you are sorely missed!"
5,"a live set of boogie rock magic, southern flavored","this cd might be obsolete with the introduction of the newly expanded version, but i don't have that one so I won't review it. This cd is intense and awesome, often cited as one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. And it does hold up since the 70's, with great tunes that are perfectly played and wonderfully arranged. this is boogie rock that is extremely polished, with synths and bongos giving it a party-rock atmosphere. A great live document to a very underappreciated band; just pop it in and enjoy. There isn't a weak moment on here."
3,"""Waiting..."" Waited a Bit Too Long","This isn't a bad live album. The raucous encore of ""Feats Don't Fail Me Now"" is almost worth the price of admission.However, it's unfortunate that Little Feat didn't release a live album in 1974 or 1975, rather than 1978. By this point, Lowell George's influence was waning, the band's tendency to noodle makes for ridiculously long jams in a live setting, synthesizers were being used as a musical crutch, and a number of selections are drawn from the Feats' weaker late-70s albums.Again, this isn't bad, but it could have been so much better."
1,Little Feat ain't the same without Lowell George.,"Back when Lowell George was still around, this band really put out great music. Maybe someday they'll figure out a way to resurrect him. The yayo got 'im as a young man."
5,Little Feat at their best,"This recording exhibits what Lowell George did in the finest way possible. The persona of Little Feat changed after his death, because his contributions to the group were irreplaceable. For anyone who likes good old rock 'n' roll - this is IT! Somehow these musicians had something together that is almost never found and that is a love of each other's talents. When they hit the stage for a performance, one knew immediately that it was going to be a rip-roarin' helluva ride. They never dissapointed anyone, that I know of. I will never forget seeing this tour. After the concert was over, I had laughed and smiled so much that my face hurt - no exaggeration!"
5,Fantastic,A great live recording. This is top of the list along with The Allman Brothers live at Fillmore East and Skynyrds One More From The Road.
5,Number 1 on the must have list!,"Waiting for Columbus is Little Feats greatest record. The re-issue by Rhino just made it that much better. I originally bought the vinyl copy when it first came out and it stayed on my turntable for 2 weeks straight. Of course some 20 years later having wore it out long ago and wearing thin my cassette, I was happy to hear Rhino was going to give us the full version on CD. Of course the fine folks at Rhino had to throw in some extras, and they are worth the price by themselves. Whether you own any of Little Feats fine recordings with then lead singer Lowell George or not, you have to have this double CD in your collection. This rates as one of the best live recordings of all time."
4,A must for Little Feat fans!!,So happy to add this to my music collection! Little Feat is one of my favorite bands and it's nice to have this great re-mastered release.
2,One of the worst sounding CD I have ever Purchased,"Warner Brothers has a sticker on the outside of this CD which claims they have digitally Remastered it, and all I can say is they have done a disservice to Little Feat and their fans by releasing this poor excuse of a CD, ether that or I received a bootleg copy because some of the songs on it are unintelligible when I tried to play it on both my BMW with its premium sound system and on my BOSE system in my home, plus a couple of the songs have been cut short in order to fit other song onto the #2 Disk, I have already sent my copy back for a refund and will download and burn my own Little Feat songs to disk because I know they will sound better.After I look at the many 5 star ratings that others gave this CD I can only assume I received a bad one because of the poor sound quality."
1,deceptive advertisement,"this album leaves out 2 very important songs in order to cut it to only 1 cd. when i wrote about returning it they were not receptive, even tho i had not opened the package. we are trying to replace our pre-katrina collection and i am extrememly disappointed in this item. the writing on the package is not really visible in the amazon advertisement but quite clear in person. deceptive!!"
3,Not aways the way you remember,"Regarding 'Waiting For Columbus'.....well, it's a fine album, however, it's just not as good as I expected it to be. I have several Feat albums, but I thought this would be nice on CD. It doesn't sound that clean, and the Memphis Horns are not well mixed in, in my under educated opinion, they may have well have been playing in Memphis as much as you hear them... It just doesn't seem to hold up as well as many others by my favorite folks of that era.........but of course, neither do I. Perhaps I needed to be in a 'different state of mind!'....I'll do that and perhaps I'll get on my sailin' shoes!"
3,Its OK,"This is the first mascara I have ever worn(nope never worn any kind before) and I have to say I am kinda disappointed. It does stay on so that is a good thing, Im not sure about the crying part yet and it does come off when I wash my face so that is good as well. However it doesnt do much for my eyes. I wanted my lashes to be darker and fuller so my eyes would pop more but this stuff is not that dark and I bought black. However if youre just going out to run errands or something small then you could put some of this on for a small enhancement but going out on a date or with friends or to look super sexy? No way."
2,Waterproof? NOT!!!,"The ""waterproof"" designation is a joke. This mascara starts ""melting"" off my lashes, causing my eyes to burn, within an hour or two. (I have no allergies to makeup.) It also flakes off like crazy, leaving little black pieces on the cheeks. Gives no fullness at all, unless you apply it 2-3 times, which makes it flake even worse. Goes on very wet and thin. Avon USED to make great waterproof mascaras, but they've all mysteriously disappeared from their product line in the last 6-9 months, which makes me exceedingly disappointed and frustrated."
2,Not Worth The Money,"This shape sorter is not bad... it should just be in the discount bin for 9.99. It is flimsy plastic and the shape containing ball loosely attaches to the snail's back. The pull string is about 6"" long, so not many toddlers are going to have the patience to ""pull"" it along."
5,Betty Carmack's Book Hits An Emotional Cord For Pet Owners,"I have just finished reading this book any can't say enough positive things about it. Ms. Carmack's book is not a ""quick fix"" to help someone through the grief process of loosing a pet. It is however, a book for anyone who has a pet, anticipates the loss of their pet or who is currently going through the grief process. Ms. Carmack candidly talks about her own personal emotions concerning the pets she has lost as well as stories of others and their pets who range from cats, parrots, horses, dogs. This is an ""easy read"" that will capture your attention from the start. You won't want to put it down."
2,Heaven?,"I live in San Francisco where Betty holds Grief Support meetings. I'm glad I read the reviews here. I won't go now.After 5 months, I am still crying every day over the loss of my best friend ever, ""Cougar"". I worked at several California SPCAs so I know the basic methods of dealing with pet loss.I'm a non-believer in God, certainly not a Christian, & I wouldn't be able to read this, given the reviews about it.Nothing wrong with people who choose to believe in heaven - I just don't."
4,Miss Withers At Sea,"Crusty schoolteacher / sleuth Hildegarde Withers can't escape mysterious deaths even on a trans-Atlantic crossing on an ocean liner. En route to England she spends part of her time (when not feeling queasy) sizing up her fellow passengers. Her intuition helps when passengers and crew start dropping over the side, or just dropping. A satisfying entry in the series, but not the best (see ""Penguin Pool Murder"" or ""Murder on the Blackboard."")"
3,A little bit too hard.,"I'm a big fan of most Ravensburger games and puzzles and I really like the idea behind this toy. I love games that involved fine motor skills and my daughter, at 4.5 typically does really well with them. Even though this game is for ages 5 and up, she's usually somewhat ahead of her peers in terms of motor skills. Unfortunately, she really can't do this game. Honestly, I can't really either and I'm a 30-something adult. It's actually sort of frustrating. I'm looking at all the reviews here and only a handful mention how incredibly hard this game is. My daughter loves games and was really incredibly frustrated with this game. It was a bit of a blow to her self-esteem since usually she excels at things involving gross and fine-motor skills.Maybe in a few years we can try again, but given that even I have a hard time with this, I'm not even sure we'll be playing much of it down the road. Great idea, but the execution is really maybe too hard."
4,Penguins Everywhere,"This game is a bit too difficult if plated as directed. We took our iceberg off the ""floating sea"" and instead let the iceberg stand flat on the table top. Little (and big) hands still find plenty of challenge piling the penguins on the berg. It's a lot of fun and even the 2.5 year old can play."
4,"May Look Easy, But It Gets Tricky!","First I put all the penquins together, which I thought should have been assembled at the factory. Most of them went together fine, but a couple were little stinkers. Thanksgiving Day I brought this out with several other games and several people tried it. The kids thought it was fun. The first few penquins are easy to get on, and it's not until you get towards the end that the real balancing fun begins. The iceberg gets rather crowded when all the penquins are on it. One of the nice things about this game is that you can play by yourself. Also, it helps develop fine motor skills and eye/hand coordination.I ordered this because we always have so much fun withDon't Break the Ice, which we've had for years. However, other than the ice, there is absolutely no similarity between the two. I think the kids still prefer Don't Break The Ice."
3,A Bit Too Wobbly,"I used this game with 5 year-olds during our therapy time and ended up taking it off the base because keeping the penguins on for little hands was just too difficult. I was also surprised that all of the penguins had to be put together in 3 steps, which took awhile to do. It proved too frustrating for most of my students so I popped them together myself before we played. The game itself is durable,the box is sturdy and I'm sure it will last for years. I would recommend this for children older than 5 (although I'm not sure they won't get bored easily). Seniors or other occupational therapy patients could use it as a fine motor activity during sessions."
3,more boring than other Ravensburger games,"We love Ravensburger, but this is not a favorite around my house. Try Cat and Mouse or Labrinth...much more fun."
3,PenguinToy or Display?,A must for any penguin collector with grandchildren.....A little hard for the young ones to play by the rules in game....But let them make up their own! I had it in one of my penguin displays at the holidays!
4,Fun for conpetitive kids!,The game was more fun for the older (7 to 10 year olds) because if you touch the mountain it will knock off most of the penquins...little ones had no defense against the rocking. Fun anyway. Would buy again. Thanks for no-hassle shopping Amazon.
4,Not bad,"This is kind of fun even for adults to try to balance the penguins on the ice. It tips pretty easily. The box suggests 5 and up. My youngest, who just turned 4, can sometimes place the penguins and my 6-year-old thought it was still somewhat challenging. 5 might be right depending on how much patience the kid has. Someone wins by being the first to place all his or her penguins on the ice. For us though, the game felt unfinished with penguins left over so we've sometimes played it as a more cooperative game. That works for the little ones."
3,"Fun, but 4 yr old got bored","This comes game comes with a plastic type of ice cube mountain, that sits on a plastic holder. The holder has to be balanced with the little penguins that come with this. Each player takes penguins, and puts them on the ice mountain with out the mountain tipping . It is a little tricky, but fun.The penguins come in 3 pieces, that you have to snap together before playing ,which is easy and fun. There is a front, the back , and the face with penguins wings.My 4 yr. old Grandson like to hear them snap together. Then we could play the game.I think the game is good for a child to learn about balancing.I think this game is for kids that are older then 4, as it says.My Grandson liked the game, but got bored rather quick..He got excited when the ice mountain tipped over, and all the penguins fall off. Then you start over again."
2,Too much singing!,"I would have liked to know before I bought this CD set that 90% of the songs had singing, instead of just orchestra. I listened to the previews, and very few revealed the singing, which is okay if that is what you want, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had known. I will never play it again. I am very disappointed. I was really looking forward to the beautiful music alone."
2,Pages Falling out!,"At first sight the book seemed to be in good shape, had a few markings here and there but then the pages started falling out!"
5,Fascinating first person accounts,"The book is filled with first hand accounts of known events and little known events that occurred during the war. It is extremely interesting to read what people felt and lived during the conflict instead of hearing/ reading a historians account of what they believe happened. As the book is a compilation of letters and writings it is somewhat disjointed since it cannot logically weave a cohesive story but it makes up for that in riveting first hand accounts of the events and atrocities witnessed by its participants. Compared to a magazine with 30 pages of rehashed stories for 5.99, the 10.00 is well spent...."
5,"Our Heroes, not forgotten","No matter what war was involved, all armed forces suffer Mentally, Physically,and Emotionally. True heroes, not wanting to be heroes, doing their duties, to protect, what was important. Those who lives were lost, I pray for you, my heart goes out to you, and the emptiness we all feel, when our sons, husbands, brothers, and whatever family labels are placed upon you, my blessings are not wasted. Bless you all..."
4,Wealth of Information,This book came just in time and in better condition than I expected. This book had a wealth of information.
3,"good sound, annoying to set up","The sound is significantly better than the standard i-pod buds, especially base response. The lanyard and break-away connection on the cord are useful when working out. I find the cord longer than it needs to be. You would need to be wearing your i-pod on your knee to need so much line. Putting it on is kind of fussy, as there are lots of pieces that are always tangled. Good value overall."
2,not worth $25 for these pairs of Sennheiser,"Pros: hang it on your neck and you never need to worry ear buds fall on to floor.Cons: bad sound. muddy. no clarity, practically no base and treble, I don;t know why some other reviewers say it;s better than i-pod ear buds. It;s even worse than the ear buds came with my Creative 1Gb Nano mp3 player! I have Sennheiser PX100, which just about $20 more, has 10 times better sound. with $25, this pairs of ear buds definitely way overpriced. I guarantee you, you can find a pair of headphone with the same quality in walmart just under than $10. I suggest you to get Koss CS75, which as least is 5 times better sound, and half of the price. I was duped into buying MXL51 by the reputation of Sennheiser. Anyway, I mainly use this pair to listen to my lectures and some calming music at night, so it does nt matter. If you realy want to enjoy music, I highly recommand Sennheiser px100, the white version, you won;t be disappointed. stay away with MXL51"
2,short life span,"I bought 2 of these. the first one lasted 1 year. so when one headphone went out i bought the second pair, which lasted 2 months. The concept is awesome because i have my ipod close by for work, gym, grocery store, wherever. for my 3rd pair of headphones with the same concept I found a different productSony MDR-NE2 Neck Strap Stereo Earphones. So far these seem to be a better package in looks, form and function."
4,Great but I had to perfect them.,These are great headphones especially if you have a Ipod Nano 3G. The sound quality is good for the price of the headphone. The only thing I had to improve upon is the safety release. I almost dropped my Ipod from three stories because I caught the lanyard on something and opened the safety release and fortunately it fell where I was standing. To remedy that I got some medium size black string and tied it to both sides with a lot of slack so it has a secondary safety.
2,A Few Stale Leftovers,"It appears that the five overlong tracks were originally cut c. 1975 along with many other tunes, live in Woodstock, New York. A hard-to-find double album was issued in '77 and this fairly easy-to-find record came out eight years later in the U.K., with presumeably unused material from the show(s). One might surmise that these numbers were issued primarily for diehard Diddley completists: indeed, the vinyl album jacket label shows ""Fan Club"" as the label."
1,"Latter era Bo, none of his signature tunes...","Oh why can't we have Bo Diddley's ""Beach Party"" on CD, recorded live at Myrtle Beach in his prime, with all those great ""shave and a haircut"" rhythm songs for which he is so deservedly known. Bo isn't a funk artist, he's a pioneer of rock and roll."
1,Do NOT BUY TAXCUT!,"I have been wasting my time with downloads that don't download, updates that aren't updated and ""help desk"" representatives who aren't helpful for nearly 2 months now. In fact, I'm writing this while on hold with tech support, which is NOT a toll-free number. They can't even walk me through an uninstall. This has been a nightmare. I'm going to try to get my money back and do this the old fashioned way. So much for getting my taxes done early...thanks to this worthless product, I'm going to be cramming at the last minute."
1,TOO TAXING FOR ME,"I'll admit it, I have an old PowerMac 7600 with OS 9.1. Spent 6+ hours doing my taxes. The download update feature was anightmare, the instructions didn't make sense at all and it took forever to download 17.1 MB. I don't know if it had to do with IE 5.0 or what. Some of my downloads took 45 minutes and then I got an error. However, I did get it to work I see some other users had download issues as well. Once I got into entering my data it wasn't so bad and I was able to print my return on an HP inkjet. Between this and TurboTax, pick your poison I guess. I didn't want to e-file, God forbid. I think next year, I'll spend the extra 100 bucks and have a tax professional/accountant do them. At least I know it will be done right."
1,TaxCut is window-ware,"I have used TurboTax for Mac since it was MacInTax, but I tried TaxCut this year because of Intuit's spy-ware policy. This was a mistake!Here is what TaxCut can't do:- Only a single form can be viewed at a time.- It requires a convoluted process to view associated documents - not like the quick zoom feature on TurboTax.- The interface is not Mac-like and not intuitive; it is like a windows program- The Help center does not work. Clicking on hyperlinked text to get answers to specific listed questions invariably yields the message ""No help topics available.""- The only way to print a state form is through the interview. Using the cmd-P gets the print menu but even selecting all forms gets only the federal ones.Overall, this is poorly designed software."
1,Mac Users Be Aware,"I have a fairly simple tax needs. I am switching from TurboTax ( which was out of stock ) to TaxCut, which claims it can transfer your data from last year's TurboTax forms. But this capability dosen't come in the box, it comes in the form of a 25 Megabyte download, and I don't have DSL, so I gave up on that and entered everything over again. When I was ready to do my state taxes, I discovered that the California forms were not going to be available until February 28th! None of the Federal Updates ( strongly suggested ) are available yet for Mac, probably not until late Feb! I'm doing my taxes with a pen and ink and returning this software."
1,Very disappointing,"I made the mistake of swapping from TurboTax.The Tax Cut software does not give me a warm comfortable feeling that it has done everything properly. The questionaire is obtuse, the search for help does not work with my browsers.The website for tax cut is useless. The Federal update won't download, neither will the State . Only 1 of two emails has been responded to by tech support. (I never had a problem before, been doing my taxes on my Mac since 1995)Absolutely P'O'd at Tax time... just what I needed."
2,A little disapointed at the start,"I'm a little disapointed with this product at the start. Note, I haven't started using the software, I've just installed it and tried to update the software.There are two main issues:1.) Update download- the update download wasn't working as the ftp site reached it's max user limit of 200. With the sales of this product you would think they would have more than 200 allowed on at 1 time to the site.2.) State Tax software- the State Tax software won't be ready until later Feb. Now wonder why they give it to you free.Hopefully the actual use of the software will be better than the setup. As a long time Turbo tax customer I'm starting to wonder about my choice for this years taxes."
3,Just not having fun,"This game is frustrating. The Hummers are slow, and don't turn well. I was thinking it be more off road when I ordered it. You drive on roads in every mode of this game."
3,good for repetitiveness,Not a bad game. But its the same thing over and over. Also the game is fairly easy.
4,"It's pretty good, the warming is good too, but i dun like to texture.","I have used this brand before, and I think the original one (water-based) is very nice one, and I have a high expectation on that. Actually, this one is not that bad, the warming is not very hot, but a gentle one, but I dun really like the texture, it's like having some honey on ur body, I will give this 5 stars, if the texture is better."
4,Good Price for Performance,"Taps this size can be very expensive. I only occasionally need a tap this size so for ~$16 vs. $85, this tap does the job ok.The teeth held up ok when I repaired the galled threads on the top of a new hot water heater.Note is is a Carbon Steel which does not compare to the performance expected if it were made of HSS (High Speed Steel.) If you are going use this tap as a professional and often, I recommend a tap made with HSS (~ $60 to $104; depending on coating).Example- http://www.amazon.com/Union-Butterfield-TN1541-High-Speed-Medium/dp/B004J4VV2Y/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1356906134&sr;=1-2&keywords;=3%2F4-14+NPT+HSS+tap"
3,Bosch - Made in China,"I was surprised to see Bosch as the brand, but a little more that Bosch sold out to cheap labor. I did search for the cheapest 3/4x14 pipe tap so I expected nothing other. Its for cleaning the threads on my RV water heater anode plug. Its high carbon 4 flute.. good enough."
4,Incredible Teacher and Notable Author,"I had Dr. Mestrovic for one of my Sociology classes at Texas A&M. Not only was he an intelligent and interesting teacher, his theories were well founded and fit society today. This book outlines some of his theories while giving light to why people act the way they do. Get the book if you want to know why President Clinton is still in office or why the norms in our society are they way they are."
3,one detail is worth the price of addmissionI,"I have to admit many details are useless , however whe one thinks of the life cycle ouilding there is value in thisbook.Take for instance the great detail on garage door thresholds. I have worked concrete for 36 years and this was the best way to insure along service life for a weather proof seal . Please be aware of some stellar details to be found and dont throw the baby out with the bath water."
1,Waste of Paper,I wish I could give it a zero star rating. This book is junk and waste of our natural resource. It is useless.
2,Disappointing,"These details are too general and devoid of any context. Perhaps slightly useful as a reference but certainly not useful as tool to learn the art of detailing. Stick with Wakita's ""Professional Practice of Architectural Detailing""."
3,Lackluster Offering,"Like other reviewers have stated, this box of Hidden Treasures cards is primarily composed of common player cards. Although I don't collect for profit, I do enjoy getting nice cards every once in awhile. I did manage to pick up a few cards of elite ballplayers, but they were mainly All-Star cards. In fact, only a Dennis Eckersley card really stood out from the bunch. I've got plenty of common cards from the last three decades already, and if that's what you want, pick up this box.I recommend going directly to a hobby shop to purchase single cards if you are after anybody in particular. You'll spend a lot more money hunting for them in these boxes than paying for individual cards."
1,Autograph - I don't think so.,"I bought these cards for my son's birthday. He doesn't have many older cards so I thought he would be excited to see what older cards or autograph he might get. What he got was a variety of older cards (since the early 1980's) which had obviously already been picked over for the good ones. In the whole box the only hall of famer was a Kirby Puckett. There was also no autographed card. When I looked at the box there was no guarantee of an autographed card. It says there is a 1:500 chance you'll get one. There are 140 cards in a box. The Amazon description says ""Each box contains ONE Autograph card"". Sounds like false advertising to me. Look around before you waste your money on these cards."
1,What a huge disapointment.,"If all you want is to buy a bunch of common worthless cards this is your product right here. Your actual chances of finding a card thats even worth $1-$2 is slim-to-none. Don't waste your money like I did instead invest your money into something more worthly, like graded cards or even autographs. ""Worst card scam ever"""
3,Average value,"I collect Hall of Famers and I got a few decent cards, although they were the Kelloggs cards but for the most part the cards were commons. The autographed card was of Jon Garland of the Sox but the card was not one from the big named card companies.I felt like I got my moneys worth for what I collect but it might not work out for others."
5,Wonderful treatise,"This is a wonderful treatise on Sri Ramakrishna, the great Indian mystic. Originally written in Bengali by Swami Saradanananda, this has been translated wonderfully in English by Swami Chetanananda."
5,"Excellent, useful reference guide","This new (Feb. 2005) edition of this book is highly useful for couples who plan on living together but not getting formally married. The design is attractive, useful features (such as a checklist) are included, and religious covenants are included as is domestic partner registration bankruptcy, children, and many other topics that couples need to consider. Highly recommended!"
4,"Punk, Rave, and adorable!","I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes. The boots, if you slit the back the rest of the way down, fit my girl for photographing purposes, but the backs of her feet don't fit completely. I love the fact that the boots have hidden velcro on the back to keep them from opening or falling off...really great quality! The skirt is a bit too poufy, but easily flattened. Great little leggings, adorable skirt, and beautiful corset style top in black velvet! Really sweet, and looks great on MSDs!"
5,Bigger and BETTER,"When these came in, I was surprised how much bigger they were. This is a good thing since I needed to move 5 plants than I had growing in 2inch Rockwool cubes. I am planning on using these cubes in a DWC hydroponics setup I have got going.Getting the PH all balanced out, since I use General Hydroponics PH Test Kit, which includes everything you need to get your PH to around 5.5 which Grodan Rockwool needs to be in for 24 hours. Highly recommended!"
3,blissfully yours,i don't know why i bought this movie.it was not what i thought it was. this is one of those movies you take a chance on.you cannot win them all
4,"Basic, solid work by Cho","Unlike his deeper, Spirit-led works (Prayer the Brings Revival, The Fourth Dimension, The Apocolyptic Prohecy) this book is a basic primer in Christianity. This is a simple, solid text covering the basic doctrines of the Christian faith: Who is God? How do relate to Him? What is the relationship between the believer and Jesus?Cho is certainly God's man for this generation. This is a foundational work for those new to the faith."
2,"Dangerous, mistaken advice","While this book has many merits in several sections, the part about putting a baby down to sleep is dangerously wrong. The American Academy of Pediatrics has revised its recommendations to avoid Sudden Infant Death syndrome (SIDS) and now recommends putting babies down to sleep only on their backs, not their sides, as this book suggests. The AAP also strongly discourages the use of blankets or soft bedding to avoid smothering, particularly with newborns and infants, and this book tells readers to cover the baby with ""a variable number of light blankets.""This author/publisher really should revise this book in future editions; it's negligent to market this as reliable medical advice."
3,"OK, I Give Up","I just finished watching this film, and must say that it was pretty good. But the ending just made no sense. From the comments posted here, I think there is supposed to be some solution here that I'm obviously not getting. Any overall theories explaining the ending would be appreciated. And hey, if you haven't seen the movie yet don't read the replies to this post if you want to avoid spoilers."
3,A frightening Actor,"The Ugly is, indeed, a frightening movie.Just about every character in it is scary. Paolo Rotondo as serial killer Simon Cartwright is especially good. Rotondo doesn't look menacing, nor does he try to, and that gives authenticity to his performance. But the actor who mesmerized me is Roy Ward, Simon Cartwright's doctor. Ward looks and talks as if his main intention is to send chills through every part of your body. And when he tells Rebecca Hobbs' character that he has seen the uglies too, watch out! Right now, I'd see anything Roy Ward is in. His Dr. Marlowe is one eerie, unforgettable performance."
5,SEE THIS MOVIE!.,"This was the first movie I saw at the 1998 Dublin Flim Festival. The first of 25 movies in 8 days. Not only was the UGLY my favorite film festival pick, it is THE BEST psyco-thriller I have ever seen, and I've forgotten more movies than most people have ever seen. ""Simon"" (P.R.) is so deceptively ordinary, he could be any of the thousands of people you pass by without even a glance. The guy who runs the institution was FREAKY. The acting is all around superb, and they couldn't have asked for a better script. The direction and cinematography are phenominal. This is the movie Alfred would have made if he were here today."
1,"TERRIBLE MOVIE!! BORING, Stupid","I think this is one of the worst movies I ever seen, that's my opinion. I thought it was terrible. Stupid. Not only was it badly acted, but they couldn't get the main special effect correct--the blood really looked like old motor oil. Come on, I'm no special effects person whatsoever, but corn syrup and red food dye would have been better. BLOOD IS NOT COLORED BLACK. Why would they use black blood?? Enquiring minds wanna know!I had no idea what the movie was getting at. Disjointed. And in the end, I'm still wondering what it was about. I OWNED IT, BUT NO MORE--I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. Seriously, I did. It was that bad."
3,"Rent Me, Rent me, Rent me.......","Although this film is quite watchable, there are many better films of this type you should own first. For this much money, you should rent it, mail me a check for $10, and pocket the rest. You'll be glad you did."
2,Not Very Good,Dumb and stupid. Not the least bit scary. And what's up with the black blood???? Don't waste your time or money on this piece of crap.
2,"Well, almost but not quiet!","First what was good was it had a good script, and was well directed. But maybe it was just the version I saw, but all the blood except the final scene was black. Maybe it was symbolic or maybe it was for the rating, or maybe it was just easier to make black blood instead of red. However I was happy not to see computer FX!"
5,exellent,"Very good book the content is great, but the glue in the binding is bad so be carefull with your copy."
5,A Must Have.,"The diagrams throughout make it easy to understand, as do the explanations. I like that the book covers a lot of forgotten about or rather, rare forms-punches-and combos. The training techniques aren't bad either."
1,dont waste your money,"i have been boxing myself for 3 years and this book is a disgrace to the sport. The pictures that demonstrate the apparently ""head high hook"" are screaming for a jaw breaking counter.mark hatmaker is apaarently well regarded in the boxing world and martial arts world and i think he has let himself down by putting his name on the cover.im not out to destroy this books reputation as i did enjoy reading the ring generalship, and not to mention a few of the combinations where covered in resonable depth but over all i was very dissapointed."
4,awesome,"I recommend anything from mark hatmaker, the guy really knows his stuff, and knows how to present it. This is imho the best single volume guide on boxing. Stance, footwork, punches, defense, history, tips, training tips, all covered. His penchant for true boxing of the golden age gives this book that extra charm, in addition to its top notch instruction and information. If youre a fan of boxing, get this , if youre into mma, buy all his books."
2,Great Movies......Slow Shipping,"This is not so much a review of the movies(which are great) than the shipping. I ordered this set on the 15th of Feb and it still has not shipped. Estimated delivery says March 17th. I usually ignore the estimate because Amazon has been good in the past at quickly delivery items, even if they set a long estimated delivery date.Going over a week without shipping, when you show the item in stock is unacceptable. Next time I will shop elsewhere for items I want to receive within a month."
4,"One third just packaging, two thirds upgrades","Great to see the ""Infernal Affairs"" series getting some attention in the States, but it's a big disappointment that the first (and best) film in this set is the same Miramax disc that came out a few years ago. Exactly. The DVD looks good enough, but a bit flat. No doubt the images could have been vastly improved: with all that metal and glass and the high-tech toys you'd think the visuals would sparkle. The other titles are welcome upgrades, however.As for ""The Departed,"" just consider them different movies. I prefer ""Internal Affairs"" because of its originality and the surprise factor, but your mileage may vary."
4,One of Hong Kong's best,"Part 1 is a winner! Martin Scorsese released the American version and won an Academy award. What higher acclaim is there for this Hong Kong original movie? The scipt takes the ""corrupt cop"" story to a whole otherlevel. Anthony Wong, Tony Leung and Andy Lau once again give outstanding performaces with a dramtic unexpected ending as only Hong Kong directorsseems to employ.Part 2 is an interesting prequel. 2 young actors take the roles created by Andy Lau and Tony Leung and the movie weaves an interesting backgroundstory. Part 3 is sluggish, filmed simplty to establish a trilogy."
3,Not That Great,"I bought this book for my mom and thought I would do a quick read of it. I've been to Washington DC four or five times. This book has some interesting things in it if you have never traveled before. Like it talks about how to get a decent deal on a flight, rental car or train. It also explains what the Metro and the Metrobus is. It has a good selection of hotels and restaurants. I think the thing I was most disappointed about though was the reviews on the attractions. I was expecting more in-depth insights and coverages of the museums and other sites around Washington. Not paragraph blurbs. It was kinda sad and it definitely lowered the ranking for this book. I would recommend this book as a quick read in the bookstore or a library checkout book."
1,Ham and Cheesy,"The directing , writing, and acting in this series are 1970s vintage. Poorly placed flashbacks and corny music attempt to show the depth of he protagonist's to character, however these distractions began to degrade any sympathy for the main character and will be a huge turn off for American viewers weaned on Law and Order and The Wire. If one wants to see good European crime dramas look to Danish Television."
4,Great games for younger kids.,"We've had this game for a couple years now, and still play it from time-to-time. I play it with my <10 daughter and it's lots of fun. You can't really die and so just keep going, but it can be quite challenging. A great game to play with your younger kids."
5,Great Purchase,"Product as described by seller, time of delivery was perfect,my son really enjoyed the game, i'll recomend it!!!"
5,Bratz Head Games Review,"I love playing with my Yasmin {Bratz Head Games Doll}. I hate that myscene copied it!!!!!!!! Tell them to come up with their own ideas, and stop coping bratz!!!!!!!!!"
3,Very GREATTT!,i got this toy for christmas and i think this toy is really great but sometimes there head wobble a little.I just so much fun.And there outfits are so CUTE.
3,the point of view of an 11 year old girl,"I have not gotton this toy YET but, I play it at my friends house. It's asome !!!!!!!!!!!The only thing is that if your like me and this is your first bratz toy it is hard to play!!!Because bratz headgames only comes with one body and you have to keep swiching heads to be diffrentpeople !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a PAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is agood toy if you are NOTnew to bratz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S. I still want it for christmas"
3,hmm..,"i was so excited when i bought this bratz head gamez but being a bratz fan, i must admit, i am rather disappointed about it. It took me ages to get everything out of the packaging and the heads dont stay on properly. They wobble too much! Other than that, it's a pretty good doll with heaps of cool outfits and accessories to mix 'n' match. But i have to say, i prefer the regular bratz better."
1,READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY THIS TOY!!!!,"Hello, I'm an 11 year old girl. These doll heads WON'T stay on the doll body!!! I don't get why the heads WON""T STAY ON?!? This is a WASTE OF MONEY, I had to put tape on the place you put the heads! I'm going to write the Bratz people and tell them that the Bratz Head Games Is a RIP OFF!!! So please trust me DON'T BUY THIS TOY! I'm SOOOO mad at Bratz! ~*~WolfGirl11~*~"
4,Ummmmmmm........................................,"Well I love this toy but one way to make playing with it a Blast is if there was a pack of Cloe so that you cant say she got a hair cut or something, but with these other are unbelievably different. That is one tip I have for MGA studios. Everything else is wonderful!"
1,copied myscene!!!GROSS TOO,Myscene Swappi'n Styles.Old.Bratz Head games.New.LOOK AT THE THING ABOVE THE TITLE OF IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOOK ABOVE THE SWAPPI'N STYLES NAME.NOT NEW.Bratz copied Myscene.I like both but... BOTH ARE TTTRRRAAASSSHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THEY EVEN HAVE THE SAME PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"good idea, badly made toy","I am an avid bratz fan and doll collector. i buy alot of these dolls for my 5 year old. i was very disappointed in the head gamez set because the heads, once attached to the body, are not stable. they swivel around, tilt backwards and are basically ill fitted to the body. you must push the head down far onto the neck to make it stable, whereby making the doll appear to have no neck. if the manufacturer couldn't make a product where the heads actually stay tight on the neck, they should not have produced and marketed this toy, its a big disappointment in an otherwise fabulous toy and concept. my daughter does like the toy but i fear that older girls would be irritated by the head instability like i was."
5,head gamez,"ok now first of ALL MATtel came out with the swappin styles before head gamez but it doesnt mean that they copied them. Plus head gamez only came out like a week after swappin styles. Maybe mga found out about swappin styles and thought that bratz fans will like the same for bratz. I mean i like the idea of swappin styles but being a bratz fan would only buy a bratz doll not barbie or myscene. But hey thats only my opionion go waste your time argueing not my desicion to make.now for the actual item:fun: 5 stars duh, if you love fashion and are creative then this is for you.education: well not really educational but dolls are for fun and also this does value creativity and fashiondurability: not the most durible doll, ehoverall: even though the average is 4 stars this toy is just too cool 5 stars!well thats all from me, so the rest is up to you ;), Allie"
5,SWEET!,"Altough I really lik Bratz wat more than I like My Scene, I think Bratz did copy off of My Scene. But these dolls are still awesome!!-tori-"
3,Petsafe 7x12 dog kennel,Arrived as described. Assembly was easy if u had the right tools and a extra hand. Kennel is a little flimsy but that's what is expected from a 250 dollar kennel. Hopefully it doesn't fail in time with my dog.
1,"Easy to put together, Chainlink missing links","Boxes came (order 2) and they left them at the end of my driveway, understandably because of their weight. Set up was easy, if you know what you are doing but very time consuming. Very disappointed though in th chainlink fencing itself. Many of the top square pieces were MISSING and difficult then to use wrap-around wires to hold in place when there was nothing there. Very heavy I say to move, simple to put up or take down but quality fell short of my expetations. With being a wrap around, the animals have gotten lose several times. Able to stretch and you can not repair. Will never use this again & need 10 more. If need a kennel get one with solid panels that are strong & put together. Also was poor on keep critters out as well. Worse product I have ever bought on Amazon since Amazon began & I began purchasing from them!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!! JUNK, WORTHLESS AND FALLS SHORT OF NEED FOR KENNEL USE!"
4,Cheap chain link,The Frame is great and really easy to assemble and the door works fine the only problem I had was with the roll of chain link. It&#347; not good quality and is so soft it tangles! of course I was one person you probably need 2 people! It tangled so bad at the bottom I threw it out and bought better quality chain link!
1,Not the quality I expected,The kennel is as pictured but the fencing is not of high quality and came all distorted. My dogs have been able to bend the fencing everytime they are locked up and get out. The poles bend easy. Not worth the money.. Very disappointed that I wasted my hard earned money for this product
1,Crap!,"For over $250, I think this pen would be of better quality. If you have a decent sized dog that wants to get out...it will! I do have a mastiff, and he has broken out several times. I had to reinforce the door with plywood, shift one of the hinges around singe couldn't lift it off the hinges which creates stress on the bottom hinge so I have to adjust it constantly. I had to reinforce the bars that meet at the door with zip ties because any change in tension from a dog pushing in the cheap chain link causes the clamps to loosen and fall off. I have to go get more plywood to reinforce one of the sides by the door. I understand this is not one of the pricier kennels so I guess you get what you pay for, but it wasn't cheap so I would have really hoped it had done a better job at keeping my dogs in"
3,Solid melodic metal,"Lanfear is another melodic progressive metal band and for the most part they do a good job. The guitar work is heavy and tight with some decent solos thrown around. The singer has a big, soaring voice that propells each song along and fits in well with their sound. The strongest tracks for me were ""Transmigration"", ""The Voice Within"" and ""Another Golden Rage."" ""Shades of Black"" was an unusual song. It had a very cool riff but also some strange switches a few times where the voice and music changed and ruined it for me. There is a little bit of synthesizer used throughout but it's pretty cheesy and should have been eliminated. Also, they attempt an outright balad with ""Eternally"" and it's terrible. Easily the worst song on the CD."
5,Excellent book!!,"I bought this book as a reference for the board certification exams in medical technology. It answered every question I needed to find an answer to and so much more. I passed my exams and I'm still using this book. If I need in-depth descriptions of an organism, it's all there. Medical technologists or students, you won't be disappointed with this book."
4,Microbiology book,"Well, it is a little dry, but it is a micro text after all. What more can you expect? It was a great price at $50."
1,Smaller than expected,"While this unicorn is beautiful, it is a lot smaller than we expected. What a huge disappointment when we opened up our box. $40 is expensive for the size that it is. I should have just bought the one I saw at Ross, it was double the size but the same price. This was supposed to be the ""big"" gift from Santa but now we have to find something else.Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful and if size doesn't matter, go for it. But don't get it if you are expecting a larger size. Arrived quickly but can't help but feel disappointed."
2,Difficult to lock,"Although this product is heavy and does its job, trying to lock the chain is very difficult. The lock itself recedes all the way back, making it very awkward to loop the lock onto the chain. Its very frustrating to try to hold the heavy chain links together with one hand and try to lock it with the other while turning the key."
4,Good and Tough,This is a good tough chain. Easy to lock and doesn't scrape up my bike. My only complaint is that it's a bit too short. It kinda limits where I can lock up my bike.
1,"disappointed, the non stick surface flaked off!","After just a few uses the surface started to flake off. I contacxted Zojirushi, and was told to return it to Zojirushi (I paid the shipping, $28.40), it was ""repaired"" and again after just a few uses, it PEELED off. I followed all the instructions and was very particular with it, but... I have several other Zojirushi products that I am happy with, but this one was a big disappointment."
5,Awesome,"Like the other guy mentioned, he's back to kick some rear ends. DJ Quicksilver is just incredible and once you buy this CD, You will not regret it."
1,It's a troublemaker,"My mom told me the t.v. was to loud and I could'nt watch the t.v. no more, so I hate it."
3,It's ok but it didn't meet my expectations.,I felt it wrong. It come off violin quickly. I have never had this problem before with other shoulder rest
5,Great item,The shoulder rest is very good. It does not slip and I can play violin in the 2+ hr in class with no problems. If you are looking for a good shoulder rest and are on a budget this is a good one.Best wishes
3,"Nice sound, nice image quality, but","It's not about the setlist or the disc layout...I don't know if my eyes and ears lie to me, but video and sound are not coordinated, you can clearly hear a cymbal and then you watch anders hittin' it, and that happens throughout the gig. That's not right.It's not like maiden's rock in rio where you really wish you were there!, the crowd is so cold and weak that I pity DT for givin' so much on-stage and getting nothing back from their fans."
2,bought for my jeep wrangler,size is incorrect in the listing for the application. still sitting in the box because they are to small. not happy with seller. it is what it is.
4,nice speaker for under 30,"got this set in today and im pretty happy with these. decent set of speakers here. these are cheaply made however, with plastic cage i question if this speaker is built to last. the highs are good but at high volumes it distorts and the lows are just ok. i do like they way this speaker looks, nice stock look. and they an handle a large amount of wattage. i have high hopes for these guys...even though they were under 30 bucks"
1,Never again D-Link,"I purchased this over a year ago. After constant frustration with lock-ups and reboots, I went and bought the MS access point (which worked flawlessly right out of the box) and threw this one to the IT guys at work. They couldn't get it to work for more than 15 minutes at a stretch either. Then I found a posting about a firmware upgrade on dslreports.com. It was produced, presumably, by the OEM (Gemtek) for the device (see their website). I flashed and it works now, its been up for three days! Shame on D-Link for not providing working firmware; I can't begin to calculate all of the time I wasted with that thing thinking it was something with my network. Though it appears to finally be working, I will never do business with D-Link again."
1,Bad choice,"worked more or less ok, with one major drawback: built-in ""firewall"" which could not be deactivated did too much protecting me, filling up ""intruder list"" with packets sent and received by ICQ. After some number of such packets device locks up, and you have to reboot it manually. This is not a ""BUG"", this is a ""FEATURE"", it is even in the manual - they say it's for our protection.Do not buy it."
2,"P.I.T.A to get working, Poor Tech Support",It took me 3+ days to get this thing to work with my notebook. Cannot get it to work with my desktop. Tech support was no help at all. They just had me retrying things I already did. If your not a networking wizard do not buy this router. Newer models don't need the manual setup of this one.
3,Live Europe 1992,"A well recorded show from 1992, this is one of the final Gun Club releases. This is latter day Gun Club, which is to say less of the apocalyptic blues punk of Fire of Love and Death Party, and more of their gothic blues leanings. They kind of sound like a 1970s rock band live on the King Biscuit hour. They perform a Hendrix cover (""Little Wing"" - perfectly suited for Pierce), with some Hendrix licks also showing up in the solo for ""Yellow Eyes"". Gun Club fanatics will want this, but it's hardly the place to start and certainly not one of their game changing moments. I'm a little bewildered by the ratings here. Five stars would suggest this is the equivalent of Fire of Love, which it isn't by a long shot."
3,It's not Traps the Boy Wonder,"I was envisioning a stronger inside look at the Rich band, his storied and often times turbulent career, some insight on a bass drum triplet and validation of the strongest left wrist on earth. The 'torment is a musty back of the bar tell-all that uses Buddy's name to sell a book. Leave it and read Mel Torme's book; better yet, watch Channel One Suite and be amazed,..again."
4,A fascinating Life,"Even though i didnt give the book 5 stars i still thought it was very informative. The only thing i didnt like was that i thought the author rambled a bit and had some stories which didnt really directly involve Buddy.I found myself kind of skipping over those passages, but by and large i would definatly recommend this book. I now am convinced that the Buddy Rich movie being made will be very interesting with loads of stories that will interest the public. Enjoy the book, i read it in one day!"
1,Boring,"I read the book written by Mel Torme and must say this book is a lot of words for nothing. I skipped page after page as the author talked about himself. It's boring folks, buy Mel's book instead, it's great. I saw no torment in this book at all.A Buddy fan."
3,For fans only,"If you are - like I am - a drummer and dedicatedly interested in Mr Rich's personality, you might enjoy this professionally written book. But don't expect any nuts and bolts-talk or anything really relevant about his incredible playing abilities."
4,"Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, vol 1","For those who enjoy older TV series like Jeff's Collie, the Lassie series, & Dennis the Menace, the Skippy series is an excellent addition.Unlike the American version of a boy & his pet dog, this is a series with an Australian twist - a boy & his pet kangaroo. But the general plots are basically the same.This is Volume 1 which holds only several episodes but it is well worth the money.Be advised this is a Region 4 DVD. You will need an all region player for this disk."
1,worse quality,"Worse quality than typical sebagos. 3 time of use I can see the leather in two places, so the black ink is not well fixed. Moreover, they are clearly less comfortable than other sebagos bought recently"
2,Sebago Rubber Sole Penny Loafer,"Even though I had ordered the same size previously, this one is too big. Furthermore, the rubber of the toe rubs off on my floor if I am not careful. I bought these because Rockport doesn't seem to make Beckington anymore."
3,Size was smaller than expected,"I bought a pair to replace an older pair (about ten years old). I ordered the same size and couldn't even get the new pair on. Something changed over the years, so while the old pair is a comfortable fit, I had to return the new version."
3,Sizing,Looked like a well made shoe but I would prefer made in the USA. I ordered a size larger than what I'm wearing and I could not get into them. The were way to tight across the instep and I had to return them which was flawless thanks to Amazon.
3,PaolaCordero,"excellent service, my father loved it. only that the shipping takes a while to arrive, and the size is smaller than you were expecting the righteous but still a bit uncomfortable. Thank u"
2,"Nora Roberts Irish Trilogy: Jewels of the Sun, Tears of the Moon, Heart of the Sea (Irish Jewels Trilogy)",I have read many of Nora Roberts books. This is the first one that I didn't like. I had to push myself to read the first 9 chapters of Jewels of the Sun. Then I stopped. I couldn't continue any longer. It was a waste on money.
4,Wonderful trilogy!,This continues to be one of my favorite trilogies! It combines Irish Myths with a real working family.Each story stands on it's own but at the same time the three together flow very well.Note to other reviewer George. Call information and get the 1800 number and them talk to a real person. I have had to return a DVD player and they have the best service of anyone I have ever dealt with.
1,APT PRO WRAPS,OK SO IM SURE I WOUJLD HAVE LOVED THESE WRAPS. ONLY 1 PROBLEM. I NEVER RECIEVED THEMALL I GOT WAS A BLOCK OF CHALK. AND AFTER SEVERAIL E-MAILS AND PHONE ATTEMPTS I GAVE UP ON TRYING TO ATTEMP TO RETRIEVE MY PRDUCT!!!
5,NP,"great product for notary publics- lots of stickers for certificates or important documents, a little smaller then you palm, proffesional and shiny"
2,"Good Concept, but all around not a great product","I really liked the idea of this phone, but was very disappointed when i actually got it. It is very uncomfortable to wear. It constantly fell off my ear and I could never find a comfortable position on my ear for it. The sound quality was fairly poor, even right next to the base. Also, since it doesn't sit securely in your ear, the microphone rubs against your face and you hear scratching noises in the ear piece, as well as the person you are talking to hearing it. The battery life is also a major issue with this device, and it is not really replaceable at all. Overall, anyone interested in this product I advise you look for something better than this because you might just be totally disappointed with this like i was."
5,Good book on incorporating,"If you are interested in starting either a C or a S corporation, you'll love this book. I've bought some other books supposedly written by experts and was dissappointed.Also recommended books include Inc. Yourself, The Small Business Legal Kit by J.W.Dicks and Incorporate for Dummies by The Company Corporation."
2,Disappointed on S Corp Coverage,"I chose this book to get more information on running an S Corporation, and I've been utterly disappointed. The author spends more time telling you the number of words in the tax code then on the meat & potatoes of the information. The chapter on compensation was particularly void of any S Corp information. Overall, I think there are far better sources available."
4,Valuable for people who don't know much about corporations,This book provides basic information about C & S corps. It gives a thorough comparison between C & S corps for you to make a educated decision on whether to incorporate as a C or S corp. It also gives you basic info on how to set up an S corp. I used the information from this book to set up an S corp. Great book for the price for the do-it-yourself type person.
4,Mixed feelings ...,"When you get it working, the drive is fine. It does what it is supposed to do. However, the way to get it working is not so smooth. It comes with 2 CDs and a lot of software and the installation process is confusing, but doable. The case is really heavy. Probably it's supposed to attract big truck/SUV buyers or something. It's actually not a bad thing, just unusual. So if you are not afraid of technology, the drive is ok. But if you need something really hassle free, maybe you should try some other one."
1,This drive does not perform as expected,"I bought this drive to use on both PC and Mac, and paid extra for double layer and lightscribe capabilities. After fiddling with it for 2 days, I am returning it. It is as slow as my old DVD writer (internal) at copying movies from my hard drive (appears to be 1x). The tech support is lousy (not toll-free, and busy all the time), the enclosed software difficult to use, and all in all I am extremely disappointed. I am a computer trainer by profession, so I figure if I can't use it, a lot of other people won't be able to either. Don't bother unless you want to beat your head against a wall all night trying to get it to work."
2,Barely used and failed just out of warranty - LaCie support: FAIL,"Worked great at first, just as it went out of warranty it failed and with little use - LaCie support were complete ""cut and paste"" stooges, strung me along through 5-6 emails - they couldn't ID the drive, even with a pic of the back label! Then ""er, sorry, it's out of warranty"" - well dugh! - Freakin' Sad, I used to respect LaCie - but will never buy a drive of theirs again."
5,Dynamite book for any biz professional involved in marketing,"This book is powerpacked with principles that are easy to use, understand, and apply. It is a must for any business library and should be used as a reference on a regular basis to ensure adherence to tried and true principles necessary in creating demand for your product or service."
1,this book is a fraud,I was very interested in reading the book and learning from it. But I was very deceived because in fact you learn nothing ! absolutely nothing. Plus the writer doesn't know anything about marketing neither marketing strategies. Get any book about marketing and avoid this book if you don't want to be deceived !
1,not recomended,Bought as a Christmas present for my son. 1st It fell sideways and the barrel bent. 2 day later the bolt mechanism jammed and stop working.Not a sturdy toy. Buy something else solid.
3,It depends,"First off dont buy this gun if you are a weakling! Weakling= small 12 year old or younger. You will hurt yourself trying to cock it. Even though you put so much work into cocking it the range isn't spetacular but it is ok. All of that sucks but where it really shines is in its accuracy. I swear that it would shoot strait forever except the range doesnt allow for that. Also most rewiews say that it has a good weight to it but when i took it apart I saw that it had two HUGE metal rods in the stock adding at least 5 pounds to it, without those it feels much cheaper. last, the seller sends a paper saying that if you wright a positive review they will send you 1000 bbs so a lot the good ones may be fake.UpdateWell, I still pretty much hate this gun."
3,Ok,It is hard to cock for someone 10 & under. Other than that its a good gun. I definitely recommend it.
2,m14,Prosaccuratecool lookingconshard to cockclip breaks easybad rangeI think it looks cool and very accurate but the gun clip broke and its hard to play airsoft while you are muzzle loading your gun.
4,Good,This gun is SO AWESOMECheck out this youtube video you can see me shooting there and I am also giving more information (important) about the BB gun![...]Above is the URL link.
5,AMAZING GUN!!!,"This gun can hit any target u want to hit. it durable and easy to load, fire and cock. AND if you want a very nice gun and that shoots good and for a nice price then this is tahe gun u want! (range is about 300 fps)"
2,This company blows..,"First of all I was waiting eagerly for this too get here,and when i opened it i noticed i had NO metal on it, and was not a m14 but a m1a socom. This makes it even less accurate than a normal m14, it doesnt have adjustable hop-up and the shots( i was using .2s ) flew up in the sky after travelling about 10 feet, its very bad.and I cant return it since they didnt send me a shipping paper(aka proof i bought it)..i guess it looks and feels cool, thats the only reaseon its gets any stars"
1,Shake Rattle & Roll Bill Haley and the Comets,"I would not buy this cd even if I had the chance to. I made the mistake of buying it. Not the best cd Bill Haley ever recorded. The song Skinny Minnie sounds like it is done in English and Spanish. This is a cd I wished I never bought. If you want the original versions of some of Bill Haley's songs buy the 20th century masters The Best of Bill Haley and his Comets. It has all the songs that sound the way they are suppose to. I bought this cd after I made the mistake of buying the Shake, Rattle and Roll cd. I wouldn't buy the Shake, Rattle and Roll cd that is a waste of money. Sandy McClaflin"
4,Good Whey To Go,This is a pretty good whey protein. The flavor and texture is nice and it is a reasonable price. The best thing is that it is not full of harmful ingredients like some protein powders. We will continue to use this for post-workout recovery!
3,For Hardcore Dre Fans,"This is not meant to be presented as a real album as other compliations try to do. The title ""Concrete Roots"" suggests that these are songs that were made when Dre was first emerging as a producer. What seperates this from the other compliations is that Dre actually makes money off of it, which is why it's listed as one of his albums on the Aftermath Entertainment website. If you are a hardcore Dre fan, you should get this. If you like Electro or the early days of NWA you probably won't mind this either. But don't buy this if you are looking for g-funk masterpieces like The Chronic or 2001."
3,Recycling,"Dr.dre only made 2 albums, the rest of the albums...are just compilation albums on his name. This album contains recycled stuff from the old ruthless records days. I know those were the days but dr.dre choose to backstab ruthless anyway. Why remind him of his mistakes by putting a ""bootleg"" like this out on the market. Don't but this, instead get the albums some of these songs appeared on first and get your moneys worth."
5,Stock Market,"I would recommend this piece from Exec Sports if your a serious trade, and love Leroy's work.Great and Responsive Service!Richard G. Geiger, PAAtty at Law"
5,The best cd ever that didn't sell any copies,"If you like Bruce Springsteen's first couple album, Hothouse Flowers,Del Amitri, and stuff like Whole Of The moon by Waterboys-this is most definitely for u.I bought this cd for .99 cents. I had heard Heaven Help The Lonely,and knew it was brilliant.That was one of the weaker songs come to find out.This guy has incredible lyrics.IE-""I watched you as your childhood left,and your gentleman came.As the visitors roomed in the halls of desire.Where the waterfalls burned on the blankets of fire"" To write so eloquent about his old girlfriend in a whorehouse is a triumph.You will have to find this on ebay, but it's worth the search.The best songs are Renegades,Places I have never been, that's enough,yesterdays dreams,heaven help, and dont die. Why this sold so poorly is the same explanation of why Whole Of The Moon by the Waterboys was not huge-the greatest stuff goes ignored in exchange of Jerry Springer-fan type music."
4,The Book with Pictures,"Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident Graphic Novel has the same storyline as the book. The art is good and characters are easy to see against the backgrounds. There is a lot of action in this book, and so the graphic novel makes it easier to see the actions as they happen.For those who never heard of Artemis Fowl, you've been missing out. Look up the books for a more detailed review. The first book in the series is titled simply Artemis Fowl. The publishers just reprinted the books with new covers, so they should be easy to find. It's a great series."
4,Way more decent than the last...!,"'The Arctic Incident', book two of the 'Artemis Fowl' series by Eoin Colfer, has a better storyline than the last one and in fact, comes with decent puns!The goblins have been getting Class A weapons and Artemis is brought in as the prime suspect. But when his innocence is proven, he helps the LEP to find the culprit. In return, he just wants help to rescue his father. And Cap'n Holly Short realises that Artemis acts quite decently and that could he have a touchof goodwill under the mask of evil?!An intricately carved storyline, pretty much more decent than the last, and not having lost any of the action, suspence, mystery and of course, humor, this is a one awesome book!The only problem was that the technology was a bit complex to understand for me, and i hope i get to know and understand more of it as I go deeper into the series.Rating: 7.6 / 10Reviewer: R. Shinde(Nicknamed Ghost)"
4,Michael S. Artemis Fowl: Arctic Incident,"I liked Artemis Fowl: Arctic Incident very much. The plot was well made and the characters were really memorable. What I liked about the plot was that I couldn't tell what was going to happen next. This book was very well written for a teenage level.Eventhough the book was well written, the author could have been more descriptive. When ever the author introduces a character he sometimes doesn't mention all that you need to know for that character to really understand the book. Sometimes. Besides that, I thought the book was very good.I would not recommend this book to anybody under the High school/Middle school level reading level. For that reason, the book contains many challenging words and is, at parts, hard to read. This book was very good and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I read it. It is truely one of my favorite."
2,Low quality binding-- Turtleback,"No problem with the content, just the binding was sloppy. We returned the first book thinking it was just a bad copy but in both books some pages were bound so far into the pages it cut into the text. What looked like a security device was glued into the middle of a page in the first one and in the replacement book 2 pages were glued together obliterating the text on both pages where they stuck together. We will definitely not be buying any more books with ""Turtleback School & Library Binding"". We got a refund and will look for the book in a brick and mortar store so we can inspect the quality before we buy it."
1,"Truly, truly horrible","Once upon a time, there was a great movie called ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"". This film has taken that script and made it into a movie that is so bad, you can't wait to get it out of the house and back to the rental company as fast as you can. I saw the first three Billy Jack films when they initially came out, and they were intriguing at the time. Well, ""Billy Jack"" was intriguing, but the others were only fair. But ""BJ Goes to Washington"" is, first, an insult to ""Mr. Smith"", and, second, painful to watch in how badly edited and cheaply made it was. Others have given very indepth reviews of the film here, so I won't go into that. I had heard many years ago of this film not being released because, according to Tom Laughlin, of political pressure...but, believe me, folks, this is just a bad movie that wasn't worth releasing. If anything, the only thing I can compare it to are some of the inept films of the Fifties that Ed Wood directed. Stay away, folks."
1,Bye Bye Billy,"It's to easy to trash this movie and point out all it's flaws, so I'll try another way to review this one. The nice thing to say I guess is that by this time Billy Jack had run it's course. No one was interested in his counterculture ""hippie"" views by 1977. By that time it had worn very thin and people were already seeing that there was nothing left for Billy to do. With nothing new to say it was and is time for ""One Tin Soldier To Ride Away"". AH, but for a minute he did have his time in the sun."
3,Billy Jack Goes to Washington,This is a good movie but I wanted it in full screen and it came in wide screen.I personally do not enjoy wide screen movies. Thanks
2,Not so Berry,"My Yorkie, didn't really care for these treats. I think they smell and remind her of her dog food.But on the good side the bag does have plenty small treats, good for training. not too big."
3,cheap training treats,"For some reason, I thought these contain some berries (my dog loves picking blackberries off the bushes in the late summer). They don't. Just plain old cheap, small training treats. Cheap, good alternative to something like Zuke's for training (which I cut in half for my dog's training class, since it is a clicker training evening where he stuffs his stomach with tons of treats). I'm sure they're not as great nutritionally as some other treats, but comes with quite a bit for $4. My dog likes them, but he's not very picky either. They're smaller than a centimeter in diameter, and would not be good for a kong because they'd fall out wayyyy too quickly. I think they're just good training treats, or good for a food puzzle with only a very small hole (akin to the kong wobbler with maybe a tennis ball inside along with the treats)."
3,tasty,"my dog doesnt like the toy that goes with these. the treats are ok, she loves the treats by themselves."
3,ok,These treats are fine for what they are advertised for. The fit well in the interactive toys. I did find that I could just use my dog's dog food for the same affect.
1,Dog treats,"I have a tiny dog and I was excited to find small dog treats that I don't need to break into smaller pieces. Unfortunately, my dog doesn't like these. I wish they came in bacon flavor!"
5,My Dogs Love It!,"Length:: 2:27 MinsMy dog Loves these treats. I put them in thePremier Pet Busy Buddy Twist 'N Treat Dog Toy, Smalland he has a field day feeding himself these yummy nibbles."
3,Too small for their intended use,"These were linked with the Waggle -- there may even be a photo of the toy on the front of the treat bag.I'm still using these, just to get rid of them, but when used with the small Waggle they provide no challenge for my 12-pound mix. They're too small and fall right out with almost no effort on her part, which -- I want her occupied! The pieces are also too small to be used as treats; each is about the size of a small pill or long grain of rice. To keep the pieces from falling out immediately, I usually seal the opening of the Waggle with peanut butter before I give her the toy.The chicken flavoring grosses me out; it reminds me a little of cereal ""icing"" the way it coats each piece.Regardless, I'm not disappointed in the product per se, we're still using it, and my dog has no complaints."
2,Not great,"They are tiny and grea for training, but not what I expected. Not flavorful smelling or berries at all. Was looking for a vegetable or fruit option for my dog and this has chicken."
2,Crushed and dogs don't like them much,"The first think I noticed (besides that the bag is smaller than I'd imagined) was that my bag of treats had a lot of ""powder"" from crushed treats in it. I opened the bag and offered the tiny brown lumps to my toy poodles. One of them reluctantly ate it and the other refused. I do like that these are tiny since I wanted to use them for training and don't want to overfeed my dogs, but in order for training treats to be effective, the dogs have to LOVE them. These are not going to motivate my dogs to do anything. I have the toy that they go with, but I don't think they will even care enough about these treats to work at getting them out of the toy. I'll be going back to Zukes and cut them in half."
3,YUM Buddy Berries,"I this product is a little small and comes out of the tug-a-jug too easily. They also make my dog's stools very soft. My dog loves them though, so we give them to her in moderation."
3,ok buddy,"good treat for toys, but you need to find a toy that does have nickel size openings. I will last a while."
3,Too expensive,"To fill up the Busy Buddy canister toy I bought, I use up around 1/3 of the bag. That will give my dog about 1 hr of entertainment and treats. So one bag is only good for three fills? I will only get this on sale (<$5)"
1,Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats,This is a great idea for a treat given with the bone but the issue is they come out too quickly and now this is the third time my dog has swallowed the treat and choked They tend to be too hard and unfortunately my dog tries to eat them too fast. Other products seem to be safer so we will toss these away for something my dog will not choke on!
2,Not for induction cooktop,"Pot is pretty and looks well made, but it is not stainless steel all over the place, just the sides. The description said ""multi-layered bases"" but bottom is solid aluminum with non stick finish inside.If you have induction cooktop DO NOT buy, to avoid the disappointment.I wish Amazon would add ""not for induction"" in the description."
3,I'm giving this a three because...,"....it has so much good Jungian thought in it; however, he never really understood Eastern psychology, however fascinated he was with it, and continually collided with Buddhists and others who tried to break through his equation of the ego with consciousness itself (a central teaching of Eastern disciplines being that the two aren't the same at all)."
1,No answers,"I'm extremely disappointed. I'm a private tutor, and this is nearly useless in my situation. I'm not presenting lessons, which this book is geared to. I need to provide students with extra practice in reading comprehension. Since no answers are provided, this isn't usable. Neither I nor my tutors have time to read every passage and long answers in order to evaluate the student's responses."
1,Smoker,"I ordered the product in the picture and that's what I recieved, first thing I noticed, there is no brand, not a good sign, the connecter that goes in the psp is so loose you have to set the psp on it and it started smoking within 15 minutes."
2,Not as interesting as it looks,I was disapointed by this book. The cover is great and drew me to buy it but the contents is a bit all over the place and I'm not sure what the purpose of the book is. There aren't really any projects and the design foundation information is a bit hard to follow. I must admit that I haven't picked it up again since looking at it the first time.
3,Great Content,"Pros: Must read for software managersIt is definitely one of the best descriptions for software agreement that I could find. I would rate the content at 5 stars.Cons: The quality of the paper and the print is extremely low.The book is about 120 pages printed on ""yellow"" paper with relatively small font. You have the feeling that the printer that printed the book was running out of ink. When you open the book it is difficult to read in the middle. It looks more like a novel than a computer book..."
4,Not alot you don't know but good food for thought,"If you've been around software much you won't really learn alot of new facts or specific details of legal terminology but Overly does have some good suggestions for how to conduct negotation over specific contract areas - indeminification, support, adding additional users - that were very valuable.For large firm buyers Overly has some interesting ideas about standardizing the contract process and developing enterprise-wide ""best practices"" for writing re-useable software agreements."
5,A Must-Read for Attorneys,I am a practicing attorney and I found this book extremely useful. Thanks to the authors for writing it.
4,Bought for my 8 year old,"My son loves the Teen Titans, so I purchased this game for him last Christmas. He loved it! However, he was able to beat the game in only a few days. My only disappointment was the lack of challenge and level of difficulty."
4,nice game,"is a nice game same formula from other multiplayer games but very entertain, you will love it if you like the characters"
4,Allright but not the best.,"My 6 year old brother and my 9 year old stepbrother really enjoyed this game. I believe it has every single character from Teen Titans. It was cool playing it but the only thing i didn't like was that movements of the characters. They move too slow, specially Cyborg."
3,fun glam rock,"If you like Andi's Arco Valley or glam rock in general, you will enjoy this fun, if short, album. Like Arco Valley, Western Songs for Children features the guitar theatrics of Mick Ronson, former guitarist of Bowie's Spiders From Mars. While reminiscent of Bowie's glam output, Western Songs For Children manages to remain patently Sexgang. If you like Arco Valley, Veil or Medea, you will probably like this album."
5,A guide all parents should have,"This book covers everything from teaching children to protect themselves from bullies, among their peers, to protecting themselves from dangerous adults. It gives specific examples and language parents can use to empower their children. It also provides techniques for teaching children in set age groups. Arming our children with courage and tools to protect themselves is a necessity. I plan to give a book to each family in my circle of loved ones."
2,Kind of Hit and Miss,This book does not deliver exactly what the title implies. It relies on bribery for your child to do what you want. I agree with rewarding appropriate behavior but this book takes it to far.
5,The Kassav album to own!,"I have three Kassav albums, and this is by far my favorite (tho I love all three). The music is very strong, especially on ""Sye Bwa (Sawing Wood)"" and ""Soleil (Sun)"".It's toe-tapping rythem from start to finish. I've lent this album to non-creole speaking friends who have loved it as much as I do, just for the great music and lively spirit of the song.If you like reggae or Lingala, you'll love this music. Buy and enjoy!"
5,"relevant, insightful and compassionate!","i have read many books about ethics and morality. Donig The Right Thing is simply the best and most useful of them all. Although it is very intelligently written, the book does not address abstract philosophical issues. Instead, it deals with everyday relationships and quandaries. I found it absolutely relevant to my own life. The book is filled with warmth and compassion. (The author is not reluctant to describe his own shortcomings along the way.) Despite trying to lead the reader onto a more just path Dr. Hass never preaches. Nor is he judgmental. He simply wants us to do a little better, and be a little better. Doing The Right Thing is filled with extraordinary insights, interesting real life stories and examples, as well as very practical suggestions. I wholeheartedly recommend the book to all!"
1,READ AND KNOW WHAT YOU'RE BUYING,"You're only purchasing one reel of the number 1. No dispenser, no other numbers besides the #1 tape reel."
5,Great American made socks!,"Great socks! I had to search online for awhile before finding a brand of sock that is made in the USA. So sick of buying my kids socks (Hanes or Fruit of the Loom) and the FIRST TIME they wear them there are holes! With Wigwam socks, that does not happen. My kids are 7 and 5 year old boys, so yes eventually they wear holes in them. But they get a lot of wear first!!!"
4,Wonderful Wordless Book,"My children loved this book as toddlers and still enjoy this book as lower elementary school students.What's unique about this book? No words and half pages. Why do children love the book? Naughty Nancy is always in trouble, just like most young children--not because she is bad, she is just curious and fun-loving. All children can identify with her. The wordless format allows the adult reader to make the story as detailed or as simple as necessary to interest the child. Pictures are in full color, detailed, and amusing.My children checked them out repeatedly from the public library and until recently, they were out of print. If you like this, try other books by John Goodall such as Paddy Pork."
2,"BEWARE! VERY HARD TO READ, VERY POOR PRINTING JOB!","The stories are okay for one trick ponies---what can you expect from a short short? The best thing about many of them is their brevity.But the printing is pixilated, unclear and VERY hard to read. One must conclude that Scribners is no longer a reputable printer. Reader beware."
4,Stories that pack a punch.,"A diverse collection of tales. One is able to read 2 or 3 while smoking a cigarette. This book lived on the table in my smoking porch for the duration of my reading of it.I especially enjoyed how the editors placed the stories together in a semblance of order that is not easily noticed. For example, a story featuring a couple named Williams was followed by a story in which the hero is named Williams, then a story about the 'Perfect Woman' is followed by a story that includes another idea of a perfect woman.All the pieces pack a punch and are quick and entertaining. I also enjoyed the introductions as the Science Fiction Short-Short was a type of literature I was unfamiliar with prior to reading this book."
3,50 short science fiction tales,"does anyone know if this collection contains ""liar""? Please email me at jecedy@yahoo.com if you do."
2,Short and mediocore,A very thin 100 pages of okay anecdotes about Utah. Try to check it out of the local library.
3,Welcome to Utah,"I have to confess that I've always thought that there were some strange things going on here. Although there is not very much crime in Utah, there are some very unusual crimes. And the mixture of religion and the desert does breed some pretty bizarre offshoots of mainstream churchs, particularly the LDS church, which is still the dominant religion and contributes to the dominant culture, Mormonism. Harris is a former member of the LDS church, and there is some Mormon bashing here, but he really spares no one with his irreverant wit."
3,HeHelarious!,"Maybe you have to be from Utah to really grasp the truly priceless, unabashed, eccentricities that exist there, but I found this book to be incredibly entertaining and a fascinating insight into Utah's quirks (yes, it's all true). I had the best time with this book in Moab, late night story-telling; I started laughing so hard I cried and could hardly finish what I was saying. Recommended dosage: 1 bottle of wine before reading for optimum results."
4,A decent poster...,"This poster is ""ok"" it is basically a low res. pic of the logo, blown up to poster size, I'm also thinking of cropping it so the wrench is more vertical too."
4,Great Book!,"This Book is based on a true story and i personally enjoyed it, It hurt in some places and in others made me smile. The real woman, Evie, is my Grandmother and it hurt to know that she went through all of those hard times, to be honest i never knew my Grandmother was in a home until the book was brought up and it took me about a week to read it, I was so lost in the adventure of my elders, It is a wonderful book!And it is something that will definatly be in my heart and in our family forever.Beth"
1,Only for Collectors,Survivor's Greatest Hits Japanese version only adds Caught In A Game from which album is easily available in the U.S. Recommended only for Japanese music fans or Survivor item collectors. Save money for coming compilation ULTIMATE SURVIVOR or DRIVETRAIN by 38 Special instead.
1,Connected Vegas Style,"The author must be a contortionist to spend so much time patting himself on the back and kissing his own behind. This poor excuse for an inside look at ""hosting"" in Vegas, was nothing more than one man's attempt at bragging about how wonderful he is(or was). It's sophomoric and insulting as a so-called non-fiction book. If it were in a local book store, I would try to return it as a sham on the public."
2,Better than sleeping tablets!,"This book is a sleeper, but not in a good way. If you don't like to use sleeping tablets, then please feel free to buy this book. Otherwise, save your money. All fizzle and no sizzle. It has a good premise, however, the author just doesn't deliver the goods. And, the ""suprise"" ending is no suprise at all. Yawn."
5,Yee haw!,"I love instrumental music. This was my first Craig Duncan album. The version of ""Ghost Riders in the Sky"" alone is worth the price of admission! I rarely find an album where I like ALL of the songs on it, but this is one of them. I have purchased a few more Craig Duncan albums since, but this one remains my favorite."
1,You've Got To Be Kidding,"I rented this movie from Netflix to see if it was any good before I bought it from Amazon. There is 91 minutes of my life I will never get back. The DVD cover looks cool. The movie on the other hand may qualify for worst film ever made (Although I don't know. There's a lot of really bad movies out there. I know. I've seen most of them)The Director of this steaming pile needs to go back to his job at the local Video Store and watch some good films. Maybe they'll stimulate his creative juices because this script didn't. I usually watch almost anything from this genre so I sat through the whole thing, I just couldn't break the guy's heart using that new camera Mom and dad bought him last year for Xmas. So I gave the film one star. Sorry pal, filmmaking may not be in your blood."
1,Worst movie of all time,"I DONT KNOW IF THE OTHER REVIEWER IS ON SERIOUS MEDICATION BUT THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER! SOOOO BORING NO PLOT TWIST NO ACTION, TERRIBLE ACTING. I HAD A FREE RENTAL AND I STILL FREE RIPPED OFF. IF YOUR GONNA BUY IT YOUD BE BETTER OFF BUYING A BULLET AND A GUN SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE. I WANT THE 90 MINUTES OF MY LIFE BACK. OH YEA THERES ONLY A DEAD HORSE AND ONE DEAD BODY AND A TON OF DRIVING, STARRING, AND A TON OF TERRIBLE MUSIC. THE OTHER REVIEWER WAS PRBOBALLY ONE OF THE TERRIBLE ACTORS IN THE MOVIE LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Incredibly bad movie!!,"After watching this movie, I feel like suing the director for wasting 91 minutes of my life. I have not seen a movie this terrible since...actually, I can't ever remember seeing a movie worse than this one. The plot is fragmented and the acting is absolutely atrocious. The only redeeming quality is that the star of the movie, Aleesha Clarke, is eye candy. Please do not waste your time seeing this movie."
5,Karunesh,"I ordered this only from listening to its sound bites on Amazon--and am very glad I did. Extra nice new age music. Sometimes new age is too bland, ""elevator music"", but to me this is not at all. It's a collection of quite different and distinct instrumental pieces, all with a certain mellowness but still melodic and interesting. I received it in perfect order, new as promised, and very quickly. Am totally satisfied--no, pleased is a better word. Thank you."
1,got refund,"book was in very bad condition for the money.got a partial refund from amazon because i still wanted to get the book but was too embarrassed to give as a gift,so just gave before Christmas,big rip-off from that company i think..had a 99 cent sticker plastered on the front,and an inscription to someone in the front cover.ugh.never again."
3,Why are the Pearl listings so confusing?,"I have not purchased this item and assigned three stars to avoid slanting the average. This is another pearl item that provides conflicting information. When going through the shopping list, the header said the pearls were AAA Quality. Upon selecting the item, the header changed to reflect A Quality. The specifications rated the pearls as low-luster, yet the seller's description says at one time that the pearls are A quality; at another, the highest quality of A, AA or AAA; and then states that there is no grade of pearl with a higher luster. It is hard to imagine that the highest grade of luster in a pearl is ""low luster"". How can anyone expect to sell a product with such conflicting information?"
5,Breaths new life into a legend,"Quixote is fantastic! Very well done indeed, evocative of any American big city in the early 21st Century, yet timeless as well. The artwork is a nice bonus, but the work is carried by the outstanding narrative.This is much more of a novel with illustrations than a comic book. I recommend it to everyone, but readers who enjoy mythic legends will find it particularly to their liking."
5,Who Wouldn't Love Rupert Campbell-Black,"This is the continuation of the Rupert Campbell-Black story. This time instead of showjumping, he is bedhopping, I mean trying to win a TV franchise from the evil Tony Baddingham. This is your classic fairytale of evil versus good but in this case also wicked. The reason I loved this particular book in this series is because Rupert Campbell-Black finally gets what he deserves - he falls in love with the daughter of his business partner, Declan O'Hara. Taggie O'Hara is such a sweet girl that you can't help but hope that RCB gets her in the end and that some of her sweetness may rub off on him. Not too much sweetness though, I would miss his wickedness in the books that follow Players (Polo, The Man That Made Husbands Jealous, Appassionata, Score and Wicked)."
2,Did nothing for me.........,"Not bad, as far as dog books go, just didn't make me want to keep reading. Foster did not hold my interest so he's 1 author I can scratch off my list.It's OK, just not as good as others I have read. This book took me a while to read through because I kept putting it down and getting back to it later. Oh well."
1,Please...books like this make a trainers job hard.,"I am a dog trainer, and get a lot of books to review. This guy has a nice ideas, needs to make a living writing books and tries to impress us with his lack of knowledge. The dog he owns is showing aggrrresive behavior and its A.the fault of all the unnetured males, B. because he is packing his clothes to move.The author needs to learn a a lot more about dogs before writing books.Hitting the internet for cute one pages slogans is not research. I threw this down at page 40, books like this make a trainers job so much harder, massive human needs inflicted on dogs."
1,Pitbulls are not good pets,"I love animals and bought this book thinking it would share some heartwarming stories about rescued dogs and the situations that arise when they enter your life. What I got was a book about Pitbulls. The flap (very misleadingly) says the book contains stories about all kinds of dogs but in reality this book is only about Pitbulls. I'm not sure why anyone would want to own a Pitbull,even your homeowner's insurance may cost you more as a Pitbull (or Rottweiler) owner, and the breed is statistically proven to have an aggressive behavior. One section of the book describes a situation where 2 dogs get into a vicious fight and the author has to intervene. That is not a ""pet"" I would want my children or friends or neighbors around. I was very disappointed in this book and felt it was lobbying to entice people into owning a vicious animal and consider it a pet.On the other hand, if you want a good book with heartwarming stories, read ""What the Dog Did""."
4,Animal Lover,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. It makes you think about all those dogs out there that need a home or ones who are out there that are being mistreated. I think it is great what Mr. Foster is doing for all those poor dogs out there. Especially Pit Bulls. I also liked all the informative information on shelters, rescues, etc in the back of the book.The only problem that I had with the book was the writing style. It wasn't written very evenly and took me longer to get done than usual. All in all it would be a book I recommend."
5,A Good Book That Found Me,"Ken Foster's book is a great look into the life of a dog-lover who can't bear the thought of a dog being left behind. This books follows the author from the first dog he adopted to the many he somewhat reluctantly took into his home. The author cannot turn his back on a wandering dog, and his book goes through the many difficulties this can cause. Foster explains the various dogs he has encountered that were ""left behind"" or simply forgotten by their owners. ""The Dogs Who Found Me"" is a must-read for any person who has ever felt the need to help a stray; it is written from a compassionate human being who sees a value to every dog life he comes across. Although this book may sometimes be a bit difficult to read, it is very easy to get through in a few hours (because you won't want to put it down!)."
2,The Dogs Who FOund Me,"I found this book to be very disappointing and somewhat depressing. I didn't understand the premise of the stories especially in the beginning, it was more a story about the dogs the author ""found and left behind"". I thought the saddest part of the story line was here was someone that I assumed was rescuing all these lost and abandoned dogs only to discover that he left many of the dogs that he discovered needing help without any! I kept waiting for him to realize himself and at least recognize that there were times he should have done more but he never did. I hope anyone with an interest in rescue will do more to help than the author. Maybe he donated his proceeds of the book to a shelter or rescue group at least that might make up for his lack of assistance to some of the animals. The book seemed to ramble on and I found myself putting it down and to go back to it later. It was a real waste of money."
2,Somewhat disappointing ...,"As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club. I was sorely disappointed. Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing. Additionally, I found his writing skills poor. His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging. The book just ends, no real ending to the story. As I said, I was very disppointed."
4,Anything for the dogs,"I got this book last weekend and read it in a day. It's a very good and easy read, that will make you smile and tear up along the way.I've been pretty dog-obsessed lately and i was almost sad when i finished it, i wanted to read more.The world, and dogs, need more Ken Foster."
5,The truth about pitbulls and their reputation,"What a wonderful book, This book had me laughing and crying and every emotion in between.This book represents everything every dog lover wants to do. But in reality don't for whatever reason. It shows me the good side to people when in this world today you really don't see to often.(If ever)This book will touch the heart strings of you,friends,and anyone you know that thinks of a dog (any dog) as a family member,friend, lifelong companion."
3,"Ok, but no A Dogs Purpose","This book was ok. The reader never gets to know anyone in the book, people or dogs. It did make me question how I feel about Pits though."
1,Not an audio just an old book,"Not an audio, just an old book and very yellow. However, I will enjoy reading it. I ended up ordering a new CD."
4,Totally Cheesey Movie -- But Couldnt Turn it Off,I am buying this movie after watching it on vacation. You laugh it at at first ... then its one of those movies that once you start watching it -- you cant turn it off! I need to know what happened after the movie is over. Supercross II perhaps??? Its a great Saturday afternoon movie -- ENJOY!!
2,have 2 hours to burn? watch this,"This movie could have been atleast a neat teen film if the director and editors didn't shamelessly gloss up the film with Godawful graphics during race scenes. Also whoever wrote the lines for the broadcasters is probably the same one who wrote for ""Gigli"", all the corny lines in the main event scene about breaking the bank, rolling snake eyes WE GET IT THEYRE IN VEGAS!!! the only thing that kept me awake in this 2 hour snoozer was Sophia Bush, sadly her beauty was wasted in this sad commentary of motocross society"
2,Not original,This movie wasn't thought out to well. It was pretty dull besides watching them ride which was really fake anyways. The whole thing was predictable.
5,Super Cross,Thanks for the experiance. This movie is one of the best motocross movies i have ever seen!!!
3,Super cross alright and I'm a Aaron Carter fan,"This movie was alright. It could of been better. I wish the showed Aaron alot more, but I was glad he was in it. I went to see it in the movie theatres. I only wanted to see it because my man Aaron Carter was in it. He was so hot and sexy in it. He was so good. Well anyway I say you should rent and see it, but not buy it. It aint all good."
2,pretty disappointing,"This stuff did absolutey nothing for my fine lines and didn't even moisturize. I used it for a few months in the winter/spring and needed an extra moisturizer (I have combination skin). It doesn't smell and absorbs well, it just doesn't work."
2,no miracle for me,"I am in my late 50's and have noted increasing lines on my face as well as sun damage dark spots and lack of tone. I tried the Kinerase cream for 3 months using it twice daily . I also use a daily spf 30 sunscreen moisturizer as well.After about a month of use, I did note that my skin felt firmer and more toned. However, I have NOT seen ANY reduction in my wrinkles or in the dark spots after using the entire tube.I would not buy this again in view of its high price with little results for me."
1,You can't sell expired product,You can't sell expired product...I wouldn't pay $10.00 for an expired item let alone $55.00. I think this is actually illegal. Get a clue!
5,"Friends said my ""face looked younger""","I read many positive (and very few negative) reviews before I ordered my first tube. I am 65 living in Florida and have been using it once daily on face and back of hands for about 4 months. The cream goes on smoothly, and I have had no negative reaction. Friends tell me that my face is noticeably younger looking, with less wrinkles. In fact two friends, based on my favorable experience, are also planning to purchase Kinerase."
5,Great for all ages,"I have used Kinerage Cream for a number of years. My 22 year old daughter began using the product when she recently came home for a visit (she ""borrowed"" mine.) She is now living overseas and ran out. I received an SOS call to send her more Kinerase because her skin was going ""crazy."" I tend to break out from most moisturizers yet have dry skin. The Kinerase simply doesn't disappoint."
4,Kinerase really helps!,Kinerase cream was recommended to me by a dermatologist who explained that results from using it were similar to more stressful-to-the-skin techniques used to smooth the skin. I use it twice a day and am very pleased by the results. I have few wrinkles and my skin is quite smooth.
2,be warned,I would be suspicious of paying this much for the Kinerase lotion with Kinetin only. For this much money you should be getting the 2.8 ounce lotion with KINETIN AND ZEATIN. That's the one recommended and sold by cosmetic surgeons and dermatologists. Just a heads up.
5,"Clear, useful recipes.","This book is simply perfect for anyone trying to start cooking for themselves, especially teenagers going off to college. The author outlines basic cooking principles and terms to make sure the reader understands the recipes, which are generally basic, all-purpose sorts of foods, i.e. lasagna, beef stew, roasted vegetables and assorted soups. That's not to say that these recipes are bland or boring; in addition to basic staples, there are recipes for chocolate cream pie, Pad Thai, braised lamb shanks and puffy apple pancakes. The author also offers possible variations on the recipe, instructions on how to store leftovers, and a helpful bonus section at the end on how to do laundry. I already have pages dog-eared and refer back to this book whenever I'm confused in the kitchen. This is a must-have for anyone leaving home for college and scared about how to cook for themselves."
3,Good for designers,"I found this book to be helpful but to be a bit to much for me. It was a bit technical and has a lot of jargon in it for me. This would be a great book for someone that has a bit more digital design experience than me. It really tells you how to create great portfolios, but unfortunately I wasn't able to do all the technical stuff.I would recommend this book for someone that's familiar with web design, especially flash. Great tips if you want to create websites professionally."
2,Not a bad book to have... some 10 years ago.,This book is by no means badly written. It covers all the bases of digital portfolios. However this book hasn't been updated and so all this advice is valid for the late 90's early 2000's. Since then a lot of other options and tools for digital portfolios have appeared and thus this book has become obsolete. I wouldn't even use it as a coffee table book because the graphics/images are so out of date.
2,Broke on the first use,I probably shouldn't have tried to cut a 2 lb cheese block on the first try but I still think it should last more than 1 cut. It does come with 2 extra wires so once I figure out how to put them on I'm sure I'll start using it.
2,poor mailing practices,"The item I ordered did arrive on time and was the correct item. However the marble had two large chips and the wire was broken. Judging from the packaging, it was damaged before it was shipped."
4,"Wire broke as soon as I opened it, but I replaced it","I've had these marble cheese slicers for years, so when the slicing wire broke off the unit as soon as I took it out of the box, I knew how to replace it with one of the spares taped to the back. But now I'm down to only one spare. It should have been better secured, but now the slicer is slicing cheese so that's enough for me."
3,Gift,"Arrived a day after the deadline. I put things together often and this was not easy to assemble and the handle loosens easily requiring it to be restrung for continued use. On the other hand, it does come with spare wires for the future."
3,Cutting wire,One wire -broken -other-handle bent-no extra wireNot worth the hassle of sending back!! Sorry- I am glad I did not send as gift!
2,Disappointed--so flimsy!,"I am using this to cut my cold process soap loafs into bars. I read some of the negative reviews, but I thought it would be ok for my use. Not really. I have trouble cutting straight with a knife, so I thought this would improve my cuts. Wrong! It is so flimsy and wobbly, that now my soap cuts are even worse. And it leaves a 'half circle' of grooves across the soap.After a couple of dozen cuts, it feels like it is falling apart. I'm not sure how long this long this would last for cheese, which is quite a bit harder than my soft soap.I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This item broke the first time I tried to use it. I didn'e expect much for the price, but got no use out of it. Quality was poor."
1,Don't bother...go with the Prodyne!,"This board is cheapy made. The marble is smaller than the Prodyne and the wires are substandard. Mine came with the wire detached, and try as I might I couldn't get it attached. It was like the wire was too short! I have the other marble board Amazon sells--the black marble one, and it is awesome. Skip this one!"
2,Cheese Slicer??,Not the best purchase I have ever made. The cutter wire fell offthe first time I used it.
1,Avoid this slicer,"I really don't see how this cheese slicer got anything above a one star!It is sloppy quality - there was bits of marble chipped off my unit.It is practically impossible to put the wire on this unit. I tried for hours, and it kept slipping out of the little notch that was supposed to hold the wire.It is a very poorly designed unit."
5,Recommended,Fits my Mammouth goal and is nice quality. Very nice for the price. I have had it for about 6 months and seems to be holding up well.
4,Every IT/IT Security Shop should have one,"This is a difficult book to review because it is meant to be a resource, not something you read on an airplane. I have passed this around to some of students and fellow SANS instructors and tried to get some of their feedback as well.The greatest contribution this book makes is a discussion of organization structure, who should report to who and why. This is something that has been desparately needed in the industry and if this book is successful in the marketplace, I would like to see some additional research and have this already excellent resource expanded.The job descriptions are also wonderful, we have many names for the same position and I would hope that over time, this book can help us develop a common terminology.Who needs this book? It is designed to be licensed to organizations and as a rough rule of thumb, any organization with an IT department of 25 people or more could benefit from this book."
5,Empowering African American Males to Succeed is Great!,"Michael Wynn's 140 page book is a great handbook for parents, educators, or others who want to help young African American males in particular, but any young people, succeed. Each of the 10 chapters called Blocks include a foundational reminder like an explanation of a quality or characteristic necessary for success. That is followed by a poem, an affirmation, or an activity to engage the young person in doing. Each block has a hands-on activity that is easy to incorporate in a family meeting, a class lesson or a rites of passage program or something of that nature. It is easy to follow, easy to use, and a wonderful asset."
3,Weird.,This is a very strange book and it doesn't do very much in the way of analysis. This is more akin to a text by the devout trying to proselytize the unbeliever.
1,Very dissapointed,"I ordered this book which was classified as a ""very good"" used book. However, when I received it, it was full of highlights in bright pink. It was also not in the best shape. They couldn't send me another one because they say there are no more. How can that be? Are they saying that everyone wanted it and bought it at the same time? Give me a break!!!!"
4,"Not Perfect, but Pretty Darned Good","American kids have a hard enough time caring about the post-Vietnam era. For an author to make the years from 1918 to 1945 come alive, and particularly the Great Depression, is a feat indeed. Hakiim has accomplished it with this book. The criticisms about its sympathies to Communism are well-taken, but a good middle or high school teacher can remedy that in short order, or simply assign selected chapters instead of having kids read all the way through from start to finish. I have had students tell me that they are reading this volume for enjoyment, which is also a remarkable feat."
3,Cute item,"I bought this for my niece, Irie. I figure this more to be a collectible item than something she will play with, but if my sister does decide to let her play with it, I think it will hold up just fine for a three year old. It's cute and I'm sure my niece will think it's so cool that the bear shares her name."
1,Not user-friendly.,"The locking mechanism on these pruners is practically impossible to open. One would never want to use them; or, worse yet, one would leave them open at all times, a dangerous choice. I'm sending them back."
1,NOT HELPFUL -- Out of Date Advice,Many of the college savings plans as well as the rules for qualifying for financial aid have changed substantially since this book was written three years.This old book caused my kids to lose out on money that they could have gotten:1) It doesn't even mention many of the new and improved college savings and investing plans that are now available.2) And the rules for qualifying for financial aid have changed significantly since this book was published so this book omits viable options.
1,Poorly Written and Stale,I didn't notice that this insipid book was published more than three years ago and a lot has changed since then!Tax-advantaged college savings investments have improved--some have even been created--since this stale book was written. Even qualifying for financial aid isn't what it was back in the old days when this book was published.This author should either update this relic or stop selling out of date advice. In the meantime check out the multitude of free web sites that give better and also current advice.
4,Trico Products 11-611 Windshield Washer Pump,"Order processed, shipped and received in a reasonable amount of time.Product installed without problems, and worked after it was installed.No complaints here."
1,"Good picture, poor sound","After buying this camera to use with a computer for editing it was a dream. Everything that you need. The 250 though doesn't have the flash rom. The problem with it though is the sound. The 450 and higher models all come with a boom mic that picks up sound as you Zoom. IT's truly amazing. After being sold the 250, being told it was the same as the 450, we were very dissapointed. Our main frustration is that the optional Microphone isn't available, or VERY difficult to aquire. And to tell the truth a waste of investment without it. You get all abmient sounds clearly, but the people right in front of the camera you can barely hear, for the great sound of a car passing by or the wind, or...If youre after a camera buy the 450. Or stick with a company that has better after sales service."
3,its O.K.,Hard to get a steady shot at full zoom. Indoor Picture quality not the greatest. Playback volume very low even a t full. Everything else is great!
1,Sharp VLWD255U - AVOID!!!,"I bought this camcorder in November of 2001. In the first year I only used it a handful of times and got several ""Eject The Cassette"" messages. I didn't think much of it because it would work some of the time. After the warranty expired, the ""Eject The Cassette"" message appeared every time I used it for record or play regardless of what tape (new or used) I put in it. The last straw was when I took it to the Long Beach Gran Prix and it didn't work at all. In addition, the digital camera feature is so low quality that the pictures are not even worth emailing. Very grainy, little color. So, in summary, I have a non-working camcorder that is garbage or needs costly repair after one year. I wouldn't have given this such as harsh review if this was an isolated problem but after doing some research I found this ""Eject The Cassette"" issue is very common in Sharp camcorders. Unacceptable."
1,Horrible Got 2 both broke within 1/2 year,"This the worst. Eats up tape. I smell class action lawsuit, but its not worth it b/c it was so cheap."
2,Very disappointed,I bought it in Nov 2001. It has been used very little and already doesn't work. It won't record at all. I would like to send it back.
1,"I saw the warnings, ended up with broken camera like others","Like many others, I was attracted to this video camera because of a very attractive price, in light of the options. I read all the dire warnings that many had problems, but like many times, was persuaded on price alone. It was a terrible mistake. The camera, less than one year after purchasing, broke. It broke during the birth of our second child. No images of this irreplaceable moment. I am so upset. Don't make my mistake. Don't shrug off our warnings. This camera is or will be nothing but trouble. I should have learned along time ago that you get what you pay for. I learned this lesson the hardest way you could."
4,"It is a complete package, not a bare bones one!!!","I was scared by one of the review that said this one is ""a bare bones package"". After I got it, I found out everything I needed is in the package. Software, Cables, 3 different kinds of batteries, power adapter and charger, DC coupler, etc. I don't care about the 8MB smartmedia, I have plenty of them. So, this is a rather completed package.It is not as bulky as I expected, and it is rather stylish. I think I am going to love it."
4,Nice features for a nice price -- a good starter DV camera,"I did a lot of research in looking for a camcorder. I knew I wanted DV because of superior picture quality especially when editing on a PC.It comes with all the basics, battery, charger, AC adapter, lens cap w/leash, remote control, RCA cables, and serial cable. Missing are a Firewire IEEE-1394 cable--this may be included with your firewire board though, S-video cable and SmartMedia card.Digital Still photo quality is decent for web work but I wouldn't print larger than a 4 x 6 picture. You can write digital stills to the tape. However, using a SmartMedia card records them faster.I found the camera easy to use. Video quality is excellent thanks in part to a Canon lens. The optical zoom is fantastic 26x is more than enough for most people's needs. Digital zoom doesn't do much for you.Overall, it's a good value especially if you take advantage of the rebate and free accessory kit."
2,Broke in less than 2 hours!!!,"Purchased this Sharp as my first video camera. I was primarily interested in this model because of the good price and the 26x optical zoom. My main use is for sports recording such as my wife's first marathon and video taping surfing.After less than 2 hours the tapes and tape eject mechanism began jamming. The camera had not been bumped or dropped, we are not in hot weather, it just quit working.I contacted Sharp regarding local repairs in Seattle and was referred to a facility in California. Fortunately I was still within my 30 days of purchase and returned the camera to Amazon. Still awaiting a refund and trying to decide what camera to buy."
2,You get what you pay for,When I first handled the camera my first impression was that it was not built for durability. It felt too fragile and sensitive. I charged the battery and tried it out immediately and was really dissapointed that there was a big red X in the middle of the viewer which meant a dirty head. I unloaded the film and battery and reloaded them again to see if it was going to go away. The red X dissapeared and it started to tape fine. I placed it in pauses and then back to taping mode and there it was again. I'm sure the tape was ok and the video machine was brand new. Its either the head came dirty from the factory or my machine is defective. The still feature works great and works flawlessly.
4,Great value ...,"I purchased this camera 6 months ago (early December '01). I have used it quite often. It's light weight and small size don't make it a chore to take it with me wherever I go with my family. Video quality is more than acceptable. Stills are so-so but good enough to e-mail pictures to friends and family. Better still photo definition would be great, but we still enjoy it a lot. PRACTICAL is the key word here.... I imagine that many folks have found it to be a good value and have spread the word."
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had the camcorder for 2 months, quality is OK (far from great) except the stills, which are useless. Have playback problems in LP mode. Using the zoom mic as it is pics up a lot of noise from the drive. Zoom speed is difficult to control. Still no rebate check from Sharp. Will very likely evade Sharp products in the future."
2,Not quite sure yet,"I bought this unit in November '01. Trouble is, the first time I used it was Christmas, and all worked fine. After getting some new tapes, my troubles began. The picture quality is fine, no lines like others have experienced. The trouble is sound. The sound now gets progressively worse and spotty as you get further into the tape. I might try another tape before asking a ""dealer"". I knew I shouldn't have been so cheap. At today's price without a rebate, it's basically junk.The upside is having Firewire and a Mac. I basically tossed the software and cables in the box for storage. The Mac comes standard with Firewire and iMovie, so I needed none of the usual Pee-Cee assortment."
4,Sharp Digital Camcorder,"It's a nice camra for the low price... I know I have alot offun for it. The picture is nothing compared to some of the othercamras, but this is digital, and the price was awesome.... I can't complain. I like this camra for home videos and the ideayou can edit them on the computer is a great plus!"
1,Just a big headache!,"Sounds like it has a lot of features for the money. It would be great if it worked. After 15 minutes of filming, it says the heads need cleaned, it won't record and the 15 minutes I did manage to get playback at such an awful quality, it isn't worth watching. The 800 number for service is a joke and the nearest ""authorized service center"" is listed as 954 miles from me. You don't even get close to what you pay for with this one!"
2,Don't Do It,"Amazon was great! They sent me three of these, and the last one worked for around 6 months.As for the camera - don't buy it. We were on camera number two when our first child was born. I took a lot of shots at the hospital, and the heads appear to have been dirty. Even though it was brand new! Camera number one liked to eat tapes.Number three has bad heads after six months of use. This wouldn't be so bad except that I NEED the camera this week, and the nearest service center (according to sharp) is 750 miles away. The warrenty won't cover the fix, and the cost of repair is over half what I paid for the camera itself.Low light recording is grainy. Outdoors looks great - when it works.You get what you pay for!"
3,Can't beat it for the price,"I bought the camera back in December and took it to Costa Rica. It took beautiful shots of the landscape and the video has excellent capabilities.It appears to have one consistant negative, and that is the tape recording. When I transferred onto VHS the resolution turned way ugly and the sound became very distorted. I recall at one point in our trip that the ""Dew"" light came on b/c I went from a cool airconditioned van to the humid outdoor several times. It screwed it up, and wouldn't let me record for an hour or so. However, in SLC I have had no such problems and the conversion to VHS hasn't been a problem.In short the camera is not too resilient in HUMID locations."
4,Only on Amazon.com!,"I bought this camera in early December as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. The price was right, and it looked like a great ""beginner"" digital camcorder. I shop Amazon.com for electronics not only for the good deals, but because of consumer reviews -- I read all of them for this product. I really appreciated the negative ones along with the positive.It is now day two with the camcorder and he's still very, very happy with it. I'm still waiting for the tape to get eaten, or the display to become grainy, BUT I feel confident that should a problem arise, Amazon.com will treat my return fairly and efficently.His only complaint with the camera is that the instruction booklet is confusing. They don't explain CLEARLY what does what, what all the pieces are, etc. But after you play around and experiment, this is a great beginner camcorder."
5,GREAT CAMCORDER FOR ITS PRICE,"I bought this camcorder a month ago and brought it on my trips to East Coast. The camcorder size is slightly bigger than other mini DV Cam but it's still acceptable. The quality of the picture is good and the image still is acceptable quality for web postings. The optical zoom is GREAT!!! If you are looking for just digital camcorder and don't want to spend a lot of money on it, THIS IS THE ONE FOR YOU!"
1,Caveat Emptor,"I bought this camera a while back, tried to convince myself I liked it for a week, finally returned it. The picture quality was fine when there weren't little pixelated ghosts running through it. Also, every time I did a basic slow sideways pan, I got a warbly, underwater kind of effect. I tried auto and manual focus, turning on and off the DIS, but the defects were clearly inherent. I don't know what to make of those reviewers who laud this camera--Perhaps they had better luck of the draw--but I'd say save your coffee money for two weeks and buy something a bit sturdier."
2,Price went up plus no bag/tripods in stock,"Amazon had this camcorder [at a lower price] on Saturday and before. Plus when I called they were (and continue to be) out of the ""free"" tripod and bag kit. Not nearly as good of buy as before. That along with Sharp's poor customer service reputation and the spotty quality I keep reading about sent me hunting for a Panasonic. Good Luck"
1,Very Poor Picture Quality - DO NOT BUY,"I bought it when it was (...) and (...)rebate, but I returned it right away. The picture quality was very grainy, especially on skin and plain surfaces such as walls. I tried it both with and without the image stabilization with little visual difference. I compared it back-to-back with my JVC VHS-C camcorder and it was worse! Not what I expected from digital recording! I am not a hard-core camera buff, just a very casual user, bought my JVC as my first video cam 5 months ago to film my new baby. The picture quality problem is very obvious, and not acceptable. I assume that better digicams are not this way. (...)The still picture function has even worse resolution when displayed on a TV and is completely unacceptable for this use (didn't try it on PC)."
1,Take Heed,I have had the camera for 2 years and I have gotten the eject the cassette problem. It worked fine until Dec' 03.
1,Garbage after 10 tapes and being repaired,"I got this camera as a gift after the birth of our first child. I used it for about 8 months during which time we recorded 10 tapes. Every time we used a new high quality tape. Then one day the picture scrambled and I couldn't record anything. I contacted Sharp and they sent me to one of their repair centers where I paid a lot of money for service (parts were still under warranty). I was told the whole head assembly had to be replaced. Now after another 4 tapes the same thing has happened again. I wrote another email to the same Sharp customer service rep but she hasn't even bothered to answer my email. I suppose because the warranty has run out. I did get an email back from the service center offering to fix the camera again. Of course, they said it would be much more expensive because the warranty had run out. DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA. I won't ever buy another Sharp product."
3,color flicker,"After a few months, the camcorder developed a color flicker when receiving analog input."
2,Picture quality (is bad),"I think the picture quality (is bad),The device actually stoped working after 30 minutes of use.when having fast movment on LP mode you can see digital artifacts. BAD !Also unlike the 450 model this doesnt have IR flood light for night vision..."
1,Mine came to me already broken!!!,"Got it. Taped my daughter's dance recital. Play back was totally screwy. The picture half the time was just a bunch of pixelized blobs. At first I thought it might be the lighting conditions or the tape. But then I realized that the pixelization occured at time parts of the tape, when I watched the tape over and over. Yeah, this one's goin' straight back to Amazon."
2,Problem with the tape.,I brought this Camcorder last year. I see that the tape is getting struck once it reaches end of the cassete.
1,SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER,"Of course I was also suckered into buying this camcorder by the great price, features and rebate!After only one day of use, I noticed a green dot almost in the center of the LCD screen. I read on someone else's review that had the same problem. That person contacted Sharp and was told it's not covered under warrenty unless there are 3 of them. Evidently something or another is ""blown"".Also I'm not satisfied with the placement of buttons, in particular the main buttons to turn on the screen. It's very awkward.The 26x optical 780x digital zoom sounded great too, but who's going to use it knowing your picture quality will be poor?I'm definately returning this one."
3,"Good, but very heat effects playback.","It was summer when I bought this camera. I soon found out that the tapes won't play good when the temp get above 80 or so. They say in the manual its only for lp mode, but mine refuse to playback sp or lp mode video when it is hot. The heat doesn't seem to do much to the recording mode."
1,Please do not buy this item!,"The price is too good to be true! I had the same problem as many others. After taking video just once, on playback, the picture went bad and I got a small red x which apparently meant the heads were dirty. I literally had 10 minutes of video on the tape! After reading other reviews, I packed back up and returned it!"
1,Beware!,"Unfortunately I have the same story as many buyers. Bought this product due to the high number of features for the price and had to send it back. Distortion, tape eating, etc, all in just 2 tapes and one week.I read several reviews on this site and others that were quite good before purchasing it, but I too believe there must be some kind of quality issue with this camera.Maybe you'll get lucky........but I'm not taking the chance again on a Sharp. I'm spending a little more and buying another brand."
1,"If it comes back in stock, dont buy it.","Yes it has good features for the price, but... Cheaply put together and poor quality results. Mine broke after only one week, I had to pay shipping for repair and they have had it for 7 days (waiting for parts!).Save your money and get a good brand..."
1,Good Customer Service...Bad Product!,The price was something that I could not ignore. ...after a mail in rebate...but after using it I realized why it is so cheep. The first camera had playback and video head problems. So I had it replaced...no problem. Amazon was very good at helping me. It also was giving me the same problems. I am now awaitng the new replacement...hopefully this one works fine. If not...I'm getting my money back and will settle for nothing less then Sony. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY ON THIS CAMCORDER!
1,"...Very Good, Sharp Camcorder Very Bad","Just as others said....while using my first tape, this camcorder gave me a message saying video head is clogged and requires cleaning....So, don't get attracted by the main-in rebate. It is not worth it."
1,"great service from amazon, shame of sharp","This camera worked great at the begining, but just as what others said, problems like pixelation, blank spots across the screen.and started getting worse during playback. obviously there is a serious design problem with the VL-WD255U based upon many user's similar complaints.But the amazon service is really great, they send me the replacement right after i called them in express package. ThanksI hope this time i am not so bad luck, otherwise i will turn to sony."
2,"Nice price, But...","The camera is easy to use and I had no problems recording indoor in different light levels. Playback is another story. The first 20 minutes of a TDK tape played fine; good sound, good picture. Then random 'tiling' or mozaic-type lines began to run across the screen and the sound was lost during that effect. The camera wasn't being jerked around as I was only taping children opening presents. This was a big disappointment because of the large family gathering for the holidays. I'll try a different tape at my sister-in-law's baby shower, and if it happens again, it's going back. Maybe I can trade up for a panasonic?..."
1,Sharp does not stand behind product,"I bought this camera as a Christmas gift. It was used 3 or 4 times and upon playback, the picture was unclear & showed ""pixels"". Sharpe said that the 90 day warranty on labor had expired but the warranty still covered parts. I shipped to the closest service location and the authorized service center fixed it. They shipped it back to me just in time for a summer vacation. It worked one day, and now it is doing the same thing again. I have shipped it back. Sharp says they use the industry standard warranty of 90 days on labor and they are sorry it isn't working. Amazon says that they are only the go between, so I have to deal with Sharp Company. I may have saved a few dollars buying through Amazon but I would gladly pay the extra cost to have a person I could speak to in person who wanted to keep my business."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!,"I got this camcorder for Christmas, and it worked good at first. A few days after using it, it became a piece of junk! I would record something and then go to watch it, and it wouldn't play! Sometimes it was just the sound that wouldn't play, but most of the time the picture just went crazy! There were boxes all over it and lines going through it and everything! I have a very important event recorded on a tape and I can not even watch it now. I do not recommend buying this product or anything else made by Sharp!"
3,"If you want the picture quality, this one may not for you","I purchase this camcorder 12/31/01, and I am not satified with the picture quality. I got this because my anlalog camcorder was broken. It seems like there no difference in picture quality between the analog one and this one. If you don't mind the picture quality, this one is for you because you can't find any digital cameras with this price. I am kinda regretting about getting this one. I would pay a little more to get one with better picture quality. It would be beneficial in a long term."
3,What stars.,"First let me say it'll be hell to convince you otherwise if your bent on buying this. I mean you came here looking for opinions then chastize others with unhelpful votes if there not saying what you want to hear. You come here now to critisize and read what I have to say about this produck. Well let me tell you something, the camera is okay is u like pixies or heaps of technical advance computer advance things. but wait-- if your not a technical genious or computer genious dont buy it. otherwise you could be sorry for spending your money. Amazon has great varieties for your information. why don't you just try those."
5,"oh, please ,,","OK, I have read all the techno-wana-be's reviews. Just ignore most of them.If you are some kinda ego-techno-jerk, you shouldnt be here! go spend two grand on a sony and be on your merry way, and don't bother the rest of us!But, if you are a normal working American like me, you will love this camera! Now, I hate junk as much as anyone, but i know a good deal when i see one. This thing works perfect. But make sure you buy a bigger battery. I don't need to say any more.You should buy this camera. FARLEY SAY'S SO!"
2,not like the picture,"i brought this camocoder, but it is too big, it is not a mini one. The picture looks very nice and high tech and the discription is good, but in fact the resolution and color is not good at all."
1,Good price but not worth it.,"I got this because of the price and rebate. However, picture quality is questionalbe. In a fully lit room it is just as good as any normal analog 8mm. But when the lights get a tad low... say for recording a community play picture quality is terrible. No amount of gamma or cats eye can save your video from the grainy look.What more terrible about it is that the viewfinder and LCD dont even show it. You have to wait to you get home to view it, by then its too late.I got it yesterday, and its going back to tomorrow. I'll just save for a few more months and get something better.Cheers,"
1,Disappointment,"I am very disappointed with this purchase. We have had this camera less than 4 months, it has probably been used a total of ten times and it is already broken. I didn't expect it to last forever, but I hoped for more than a 4 month life-span! I do not recommend this product or any other product made by sharp. Buyers beware!"
4,BANG 4 the BUCK,"This is a great camcorder. Point blank! I brought it for my wife for Christmas. This being her first camcorder, she was a little intimidated by all the features and buttons, but once she tried it out she loved it! After playing around for an hour or so, she was on herr way to making great movies. The Menu take a little getting use to but other then that it's a great buy. The picture is great, the sound is great, and for this price, with the tripod, bag and cleaning kit. you cant get a better camcorder for (or near) this price. This cam is perfect for the fist time digital user or the experinced."
1,Stay Away....JUNK!!,"[I have received] my second camera...The second camera lasted a bit longer than the first... about 30 minutes before the same issues came up (pixelation, lines, no sound). I went against my better judgement to purchase a brand such as Sharp and I have learned my lesson - back it goes."
1,"Mine has the pixelization problem, too","I hated to do it because this camcorder could be such a great value, but I boxed it up and printed off the return shipping label at Amazon.com to return the unit. After 3 weeks of sporadic pixelization problems during playback they became so common that they made the unit useless.I originally intended to exchange mine for another unit but after calling Sharp about the problem and dealing with their customer service and reading the high number of reviews from people who have had the same problem I have decided to return the unit and look for another camcorder."
3,Am I the only (un)lucky one ?,"Has anyone else observed the sound (Crrrrrrrrr) it makes when you use the zoom ?I am wondering if this is normal and part of the package.This is the first Cam I have held that makes any noises when zooming ?Have you heard it make any other noises when the camera is in operation. Even without a cassette.I would hate to do it, but do I need a replacement ???????"
2,Not reliable enough.,"I bought this Sharp Camcorder tempted by the price and customers' reviews, but am rather disappointed. The first one broke down two weeks after I received it: the cassette compartment wouldn't open and I lost my first tape. I was anxious to get a replacement quickly, and was very grateful to amazon.com for a fast replacement. But I wish I hadn't kept it. The pixelization often appears in LP; fortunately, so far the tapes recorded in SP are fine. I copy them on regular video tapes in order not to lose my film again."
4,Lots of features...no problems with any defects though...,"I have to say that I have used this camera off and on since Christmas and I have yet to experience any of the glitches that other people have been talking about. This is a great camera if you just take the time to sit down and read through the manual, also experiment with it and see how everthing works. I have to admit the reason I bought this camera was to use it for digital editing on the computer, but with the cost of DV software, it is difficult to get all the right components together for the camera to be effectively used to edit on the computer. I would recommend this camera only for those who are really serious about buying a DV camcorder. Another really cool feature is the SmartMedia card for still pictures. Not really a high quality picture, but it still does the job. Overall, a good buy."
1,pixel mosaic happens :(,"A significant $100 rebate encouraged me to buy this video camera at a price I had recently paid for a plain digital camera. Unfortunately I experienced problems similar to other negative reviewers. When playing the recorded material, the picture sometimes turned to a large-pixel-mosaic. I admit it happend only once with a brand new TDK tape, after this I bought another tape, this time a Sony, and problems did not repeat. Nevertheless I lost very important 30 minutes of an event I was filming, so I can't be positive about the unreliable camera andI doubt the tape was to blame since other users complained about the same.Another thing is the overall quality of the picture, which is not better than of my analog Canon videocam. I did not look at the pixel resolution but it is not high, which explains the low price.And the last small complaint is about ergonomics of the controls, some keys are not well placed, especially the cateye one, which is easy to accidentally switch on."
4,This was originally called Buns Of Steel 3!,"Buyer Beware! This is a great work-out video for the legs and gluts, but what you should know before buying it is that this video was originally called Buns of Steel 3, which is not clarified here on the website. Imagine my disappointment of opening the package only to see in tiny print on the video itself that it was ""formerly Buns of Steel 3"", a video which I already own. Personal issues aside, it is an excellent work-out mostly of the lower half of the body, with some abs thrown in. It leave me feeling satisfied that I had a good work-out."
4,Buns of steel work out,"I used this workout religiously whilst in college, and it not only gave me shape and definition, but it also increased my energy levels, and made me think about what i ate. I am now a mother, and have gone back to using this tape, since I am a beginner now, I find it a little difficult, but the pain is certainly worth the gain. Every week I see a little improvement!"
4,It's okay.....,"This workout mainly includes several series of lunges and squats for the glutes and thighs. It also has some abdominal work thrown in at the end which is good as well. So why 4 stars?I can't complain about the workout, but the video itself is not too great. The quality is bad, very fuzzy.The scenery and music are a tad on the dull side. (I tend to like interesting things to look at and listen to. It takes your mind off the workout.)While many people may like Tamilee Webb, she's not my all time favorite. I like instructors with a little enthusiasm that will encourage you to do more and more.Overall, I feel this video needs a little more spice. I would recommend the Greg Smithey version of Buns of Steel instead. I have a lot more fun with that one."
5,"Imaginative, inventive, brilliant, and fun to listen to.","Jane Ira Bloom's CD is an exhilarating blend of free-form and melodic jazz, buoyed by her soaring soprano sax and Fred Hersch's multihued piano work. Any discriminating listener should be able to appreciate the wit and inventiveness of such cuts as ""Slalom"" and ""Jazz from Mars,"" the melting beauty of ""Ice Dancing"" and her cover of ""I Loves You Porgy,"" or the percussive excitement and good humor of ""Drums Like Dancing."" Jane Ira Bloom deserves to be far better known than she is; now that this CD is back in print, perhaps that will happen."
1,ITEM NEVER RECEIVED - LOST IN MAIL...,Still have a vinyl record of this and my attempt to purchase a CD failed when the item got lost enroute somewhere in New Jersey...
1,Worst Printer I've Ever Bought,"This printer deserves a ""big black hole"" rating rather than any stars at all. All the prints that I do on matte photo paper come out dull. When I called the totally useless tech support they said that this machine only works well on Canon paper. They admit that it doesn't do glossy prints well on any paper. Too bad about the reams of HP, Epson, and Staples paper that are on my shelf. I caved in a bought Canon matte paper and the prints are more dull than when I used the Staples matte paper. Worst yet it guzzles ink like a Hummer! I went through two $15 cartridges with about 20 dull prints."
1,Terrible quality,"I bought a Canon Pixma Pro9000 a couple years ago, and I didn't use it very often. Now the printer is broken. I've had a Canon i860. It also only lasted a couple of years before one of the printer heads stopped printing. I owned both Epson and HP printers and they all lasted more than a couple years. My HP Photosmart 7350 is still working. The only complain I have about that printer is that the ink doesn't last long. That's the reason I switched to Canon. I think the image quality of the Canon printer is OK, but the hardware quality of their printers is worthless."
4,So far so good,"I've had this printer for a few months now and it hasn't given me any real reasons to complain. It is large, make sure you've got the area for it. I use it as a back up printer if I need something NOW. I've used Illford Pearl paper and the images are crisp, sharp and colorful. Adjusting color was not a problem, I'm using it with CS3. I've printed about 45-50 8x10 prints and still have plenty of ink right out of the box, and four full color 10x13 prints on gloss. No problems, but if I need something for a client it won't come out of this printer. I'll use my service. It is still an inkjet printer. Printing pictures of little league teams and the such is okay, family portraits need professional printers."
1,Wrong DVD,"After receiving this DVD,I sat down with my dulcimer, turned on the DVD ready to start learning and to my surprise what I was watching was how to play the bass guitar. I doubled checked the cover and it was the right cover but wrong DVD. I sent it back with out a problem but my dulcimer still sits there waiting for me to learn its magic."
2,pill organizer,"This product is just ""okay"". I have a 7 day round compact pill organizer that I got from Avon that I absolutely love but I lost it (temporarily). So I ordered this one. It's very hard to open and the slots are smaller. Thanksfully I finally found my Avon one!"
5,Replacement Net,"Great product, Perfect fit, good quality, exactly what I needed! Exellent experience & would highly recomend this product to others.Thank You Very Much!"
3,Slow Shipment Great Quality,This book took longer to arrive than I expected. I needed it for a class. But it is a good book and the quality is great!
5,a much needed contribution to the field,Human Biology for Social Workers nicely fits CSWE's mandate to include biological content in the human behavior courses. I use this book for reference quite a bit. It is thorough and doesn't shirk from presenting controversy. The social work perspective means this book is tailored for the needs of emerging professionals.Katherine van WormerUniversity of Northern Iowa
5,Not bad,Delivered on time - somehow I was of the impression this was a new book - I was wrong because although it was unmarked inside - the cover has a lot of wear look to it - this was unimportant to me though as the inside looks like it had never even been opened.
3,Human Biology for Social Workers,The book itself is a well written informative book. The biding on the other hand is not so good it began to fall apart when I was reading the second chapter. Now I have a book that is not a book anymore but just lose pages that are clipped together.Jennifer Hambright
3,Anna Moffo Recital,"This disc is a compilation of several recordings made by Anna Moffo in the early 70's for the German label Eurodisc. By then her voice was getting a little ragged around the edges, and lacked the purity and richness of her recordings of the 1960's. However, her darker and heavier sound works well on such old favorites as ""Vissi d'arte"" from Tosca, ""Un Bel Di"" from Madame Butterly, and ""Depuis le Jour"" from Louise. There are several operetta selections in addition to the opera arias. I would recommend this for serious Moffo fans only."
5,Getting Plenty Of Requests,"Our listeners rate Doug Fitch at the top of the list with all of the major country singers. The top requested tracks on the album are Givin' In To The Night, I Can't Live With You. John Denver fans will really appreciate Fly-A Tribute To John Denver. I'd highly recommend giving dougs album a listen.Tom PylesWNAV Radio"
1,Robert Stearns FRAUD,"Ask Robert Stearns who claims to follow the word of God why he does not see his own Mother, why his children have never met their Grandmother and why after she sacrificed for him to take piano and singing lessons she lives alone in the projects of Buffalo when he and his ""ministry"" own rental properties all over.""Honor they Mother and Father"", yet he doesn't but preaches the word of God, don't be sheep people!"
5,Enam's music possesses no lyrics whatsoever,"This is truly another piece of art of this mysterious guy Enam, this is truly powerful vocal music, there are no lyrics on this CD, only vocal sounds that blends in a perfectly harmony with the music, it evokes the colorful worlds of romance, fairies & religion as explored with great success by Hildegard von Bingen, Enya, and Clannad.Enam's compositions contain combinations of pronounced sounds evoking a unique magical-mystical-atmosphere, with an emphasis on harmonies and layered vocalizing that he began playing with as a child in harmonizing with his choir-trained mother. Enam is the master mind and one again he plays the keyboards, harp, flute, dulcimer, piano, percussion, strings and bagpipes. This is a first class escape from the increasing stress of modern life, and a beautifully realized CD."
5,All the cd's from Enam are amazing,"I have all the cd's that Enam released in the last years and i tell you i find them amazing! The last one ""Luna Magistra"" is a work of art. Very beautiful. I cannot compared it to Enya kind of style but if you want a comparison model it should be her. But Enam's music is far beyond Enya, it is a different world, a world connected with fairies and elfes, a world where magic an peace come together... I highly reccomend this cd and the others that Enam has donne. Some of the tracks are so wonderful that carries you out of this world to a world appart where you can feel the magic around you and enter your heart..."
4,Susan has it.,"This is my first CD of this lady's work.Excellent with the exception of the final two live tracks which do not add to the album in way. I wonder why these tunes were even chosen.Without these tracks, it's a five star performance.Susan shows excellent range and talent both on the guitar and with her voice.A good selection of tunes."
5,Susan is great!,"She is hot! Never heard of her prior to an NPR interview with Susan. Great gutsy, blues work!"
1,Zur...go back to the drawing board,"Greetings, I just wanted to share a bit of my experience in reading Zur's novel. Firstly, his young age is really evident in this text. I find his prose to be a rather amateur endeavor, and I just couldn't appreciate his story because of this. Secondly, this book is listed as dealing with a youth who is fed up with the predictable life. Nice premise for the millionth time. I would be more interested to see how a rebellious youth dealt with such a predicable book, like Zur's. Zur, nice attempt, but maybe hit the books for a few more years and come back in sometime. One positive note: this novel is far better than those ridiculous poems he published. They were like Seuss meets depressed Marilyn Manson fan. Life isn't that hard...you live in America."
5,Sweet Voices,"I've cherished this , since 1988, i finally have it on cd..about the music..Sweet Obsession are 3 sisters from Michigan, who sang with soul and emotion. They're music takes the best form prince and old motown..."
3,Very large,"This pump works to blow up all my pool toys, but keep in mind it's very large. I bought it to take on vacation but, I definitely won't be traveling with it. It does the job though."
2,high output air pump,I had bought this product for my sons to set up there pool it's blows all the hot air in the pool it sure make u tire so fast I recommend for the guys to do it they have more muscles then the females do..
1,a good pump,"this pump works well. you get inflation with both the up and down motion. it also has three tips to place on the tube, so it can inflate different sized openings.by the way, if you are inflating a large item, it provides a pretty good workout on your arms and legs!!"
2,Not a very durable pump,"I purchased one of these pumps about 1 year ago. I used it to pump up an inflatable ball pit and it worked great. It inflates things quickly due to the output of air on both the up and down strokes. However, after using it only 6-8 times, the inner mechanism was not working properly and when it did still pump, the amount of air being pumped was reduced. Finally, it would not pump air at all. Not a great bargain at over a dollar per use. : ("
1,Air Pump,This air pump was nothing but a waste of money! I bought this because I bought an intex pool with the ring that needed air to inflate... U need two summers to inflate the ring using this air pump! I bought an electric pump and inflated the ring in 2 minutes!
1,Waste of Money---- Plastic Junk,"Pump is large and inflates items well, however, the handle broke after using it only 5 times. Do not buy unless you only need it 4 times."
4,worth the money,"This air pump isn't anything fancy. It's inflates at a decent pace, not really slow nor fast. I only paid $10 for it, which is worth it, certainly better than having to inflate something myself."
5,This thing blows!!!,"No, really. It really does blow and it blows well! I've used several pumps of this type over the years for rafts, exercise balls, etc... I bought this to air up my new raft and it work fast and seems to be made of better parts than the previous pumps I've had."
5,Love it,"I love this video camera. My previous video camera wasn't working and I borrowed a friend's Sharp video camera for a wedding I was attending. Loved the ease of use--easy to see for recording, easy to recharge, and easy to set up on the tv to copy to a video tape. When I went to purchase one, I was discouraged by the sales people saying I should get something else. I left the store and ordered through Amazon. I have been using it, and am very glad this is the camera I purchased."
3,Cool but sad.,This book is so sad. I would hate to be Tobias. It is just as good as all the other Animorphs
3,the third one in the series,"Tobias is losing his humanity being stuck as a hawk.They take action against the Yeerks that ends successfully,but is very badly thought out or planned.The probability of morphing into a bird before hitting the ground seemsimprobable?I like these as sci fi less as I read more of them."
3,Book,Bought this as a gift for christmas. I am not in a position to rate it since I did not read it.
5,My Favorite Book,"I liked this book the most because of the narrarater: Tobias, whos character I admire. Physically, he is a hawk, but mentaly... Well, mentaly he is not sure wether he is still human or a hawk. I even like his name. Tobias. Tobias. Tobias. The one thing I don't like about Animorphs books is that they are pretty short -Stephen"
3,Animorphs The Close Encounter,"This book is interesting for kids that like their mind wonder and imagine how it feels transform into an animal. Also, this book is for kids that like to read adventure. This book is about a group of kid that can transform into diffrent kind of animals, but they cant stay to long into an animal or they will stay stuck into that animal and they cant go back into being a human and they have to act like an animal and think like an animal so that they can survive and live long. Also they have to to eat real live animals, and watch out for predetors that will eat them. It also lets know kids that its ok to be diffrent than others that every kid is unique in thier own way."
2,K.A made a mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,When the Animorphs jump out of the truck ship they get into their various bird morphs right? Wrong ! Marco is supposed to turn into a osprey with Cassie but instead he turns into an eagle like Rachel.
3,Don't judge this book by it's cover.,"This was the most boring Animorphs book I have read so far. K.A. Applegate made a mistake keeping Tobias in a hawk body. It's boring because Tobias can't morph into any other animal. I would recommend skipping this book, and don't worry... no long-lasting changes to the series occur here. Thankfully, Tobias gets his full morphing powers back in book #13."
4,Tobias love,"Awww. I think this is the book that scored a million and one rabid Tobias fan girls. The plot is still being introduced for the series, but we get to see inside the tragic mind of the wonderful Tobias after his unfortunate accident."
5,Tobias will always be a hawk...,This is a really great book because it tells about how Tobias lives as a hawk. He's really smart as a hawk because he's really a human. The part when he freed the hawk from the cage at the cars dealer's was a close call for Tobias. It was a very good part when everyone but Tobias turns into fish and Tobias has to carry them into the lake to be sucked up into this yeerk space ship where they try to find out what's going on with the yeerks sucking up water. They get stuck in the ship and have to tread water because they turned back to human until Tobias wrecks the ship and saves them.
2,"herbie, what gives?",i really wanted to play this but i have a ds! why should it only be for gba! and not for gamecube or ds or ps2. at least give it for 3 systems! ugh worst progress and unfairness since elf the game! :-(
2,boring GBA driver,"The only thing going for Disneys Herbie game Herbie Fully Loaded GBA are the small digitized photos taken from the movie. They add something to an otherwise boring game experience.Sound is ok, the graphics seem ok. What looks really odd is the over real looking Herbie auto placee on the overly colorful tracks, the 2 styles simply donot match up, which seems odd coming from Disney.Game play again is averge to boring, none of the tracks offer anying real challenge, every tracks feels the same, this leads to boredom setting in rather fast.Closing comments, Herbie Fully Loaded is not a rush out and buy. The only people that are likely to buy Herbie Fully Loaded are die hard fans of the cute white car."
4,Gifted,I only bought this gane because my little sister has a DS and she loves Herbie... As far as I know she loved it.
1,Yer better off saving yer coin-age,"Yer you'erd it here 1st, save yer coin-age. Herbie on Gameboy Advance simply isn't tops yer know. So, er? yer, Herbie simply don't rack it for us, it's no G and T i's can can tell yer. So don't bother. I's thanken you's for taking the time to reads my review of the not so top's Herbie Fully Loaded from the Kings of cartoonies Disney."
3,The Moral of the Story Is...,"...Be Careful of Whom You Go to Bed With...Once you get past the cringe inducing casting, there's a pretty decent story of Hollywood, Vegas, Chicago, Washington, the Mob, and other not so strange bed fellows. It all but verifies how the Gang put the politician in the office and who was hot to trot for whom. It insinuates why the golden girl actress dies, why the Camelot president is shot, and what happens to the Attorney General. Sammy D. does a show stopping rendition of ""I've Gto You Under My Skin"" to burning crosses and Men in Capes and Robes. The Marilyn does not however recreate the ""happy birthday, Mr President..."" performance. Dino sees the handwriting on the wall and tries to sell his share of the corporation, the Pack gets ahold to movie scripts which expands and exploits thier Vegas escapades...yeah, dig? It's a cool, hip way to kill a few hours watching, but, the best movie on the Rat Pack is yet to come...."
5,"Pure excellence, the Rat Pack is portrayed to perfection!","The Rat Pack is one of the greatest movies made! Ray Liotta does an excellent job in his portrayal of Frank Sinatra. He captures his mannerisms and his soul. Joe Mantegna is also superb in his role as Dean Martin. He captures Dino's sarcasim, mannerisms, and slap stick comedy to perfection. I also enjoyed the other portrayals of Jack Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Maryiln Monroe, Peter Lawford, Sammy Davis, and Joey Bishop. The touch of scandal in the plot also made it a movie which makes you wonder if it all really occured. All in all an excellent film!"
5,Rat Review,"I thought the Rat Pack was an excellent movie. Charactor portrayals were very close to what I remember them being having grown up in the early 50's. Tensions abound inside the Pack as they deal with the evolution of entertainment industry close friendships and outside as Sinatra draws the Pack through a politics-meets-the-mob maze. Perhaps the most telling and eloquint of all lines spoken, Sinatra's reflection on days past, ""I miss my guys.""If you haven't seen this movie, you're cheating yourself out of a delightful romp through the old days of wine, women, and song."
5,Good movie,"This movie covers the political side of the rat pack, their influence with JFK and how they pushed everyone they knew to vote for Jack. Its different but still a good movie"
3,Just a Movie. Take it with a grain of salt.,"I had a hard time putting Ray Liotta's face with the Chairman of the Board's voice. Joe Mantegna did a good job for Dean. The movie is there the same as all other movies, for entertaining purposes only, don't look at it as a fact of the matter. All in all it was entertaining and an average movie. Definately worth a rental at your local Blockbuster video."
3,"Boy, do I miss Frank . . . .","An entertaining, if somewhat directionless portrayal of Frank and his boys. Liotta is good as Sinatra, but you are never able to get past the fact that they look and sound nothing alike. The strongest performance belongs to Joe Mantegna as Dean Martin, who is portrayed as the only bright bulb in a rather dim pack. The story follows Frank's obsession with the Kennedy boys and his struggle to be close to Camelot. There seems to be tremendous dramatic license taken at points, often concocting fictional meetings with the likes of mob bosses, Joe DiMaggio, and the Kennedy boys in one evening. In the end, though, the touching portrait of Sinatra is of a man who led a troubled kingdom, but cared deeply for his court."
4,Sinatra's Beautiful voice,"The Rat Pack is a movie about the love of glory and success, and the deceptions and pain that comes with it.It tells the story of the Rat Pack, their success and problems in life and on the stage, the Untouchable Frank Sinatra and his climb to power through the mob and his political connection with The Kennedy's, his persistence and loyalty to his friends, his love to Eva Gardner and his deceptions in life.A great entertaining movie with some good true history; perfect acting, with great sceneries from the 50' and the 60's not to mention the beautiful costumes and cars of that period.The quality of the DVD is also perfect; no extra features unfortunately.Recommended.Note: After I watched this movie, I got involved in all Sinatra's music which I never was. Great music with a great voice."
4,Well done and enjoyable,"As hard as it is to imagine Ray Liotta as Frank Sinatra, he does as superb job of it. I found the cast enjoyable in their roles and the story kept my interest throughout the movie. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good move, fine acting and above average directing."
4,Do not confuse with the originals but have fun with it!,"I had an opportunity to see a live show in Atlantic City at the Sands Hotel called ""The Rat Pack"". Realizing that the Sands Hotel in Vagas were where the originals members of The Rat Pack performed. I thought the presentation was great all the gags and songs sounded so wonderful. My wife and I walked away from that show and were happy for the experience. Having had seen the stage show I was anxious to see the HBO special. Well, I think it was as good as the stage show but so much more entertaining and informtive. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has any interest in the real performers. The actors in the HBO movie did a great job of impersonating the original people. The actor who played Sammy Davis Jr. was superb. If fact, I am going to buy the dvd version because I feel it is worth having in my movie library"
2,Beautiful LOOKING--but NOT a good toaster,"I searched all over the place for a brushed stainless steel-look toaster. When I found this one, I fell in love with it immediately and didn't mind paying the high price for it. It took FOREVER to toast with this toaster. When it finally pops up, it doesn't lift the toast high enough to get it out. You actually have to slide your fingers in to the toaster to remove the WARM toast. Finally, Even at a maximum toasting level, the toast never browned. THIS TOASTER LOOKS BETTER ON THE STORE SHELF I BOUGHT IT FROM. I returned it! Save your money. Cuisanart or Oster Toaster....would be a better choice!"
1,Slowest Toaster I've Ever Seen,This is the slowest toaster I've ever seen. I've owned this toaster for about a year and one side has already quit working. I expected more for the money.
2,High Hopes!,I looked forward to using this toaster only to find it took a long time to toast and one of the units never heated at all. All in all not a very good experience. Still looking for a good basic toaster.
1,Nearly Worthless...,"As stated in one of the other reviews, you have to stick your fingers in to get untoasted bread out. It's untoasted because, even at the highest setting, the bread is not toasted. As in, no color change whatsoever. It's warmer than when I put it in, but not toasted at all. I, too, am still looking for a good basic toaster. Don't buy this one unless you just think it's pretty, because it certainly doesn't work. I'm now stuck with a pretty, expensive paperweight with a long tail."
4,Russell Hobbs Toaster,Functionality is very good. Heating is quite intense so low settings work best for most items. Just got the toaster recently so cannot yet comment on durability but expect to be excellent based on my Russell Hobbs electric tea kettle which I have had for years . RH products are very solidly made.Appearance is somewhat large but it is nice to have four toasting slots. I prefer the shiny stainless steel on the older models to the brushed steel on my new toaster.
4,Pricy but good,All Hvac filters are generally expensive. This one is a little more. The fan is exceptionally quiet so I like it.
3,Primary Preventive Dentistry,"As a practicing dental hygienist, I found this book helpful. It is a great review for all professionals in the dental field.The book is very technical and some areas are not smooth reading. I did find a few helpful sections such as the one on Topical Fluoride. However, I do think I will refer to the Wilkins text more often.If you are looking for a different style of writing or different perspective (and have the extra money to spend) then I would recommend this book. It is good for researching certain topics."
5,love that has it all,"Excellent story. Carly is woman who so many doubts but she meets Sam who is what every woman would want in a man. I loved this story of learning to trust, love, and be part of a family. Recommend reading."
1,This cd sucks,I hated this cd so much that instead of selling it I went outside and literly smashed it with a hammer!(not even joking)
2,The cd's good in that it has a wide selection to choose from,"the cd is good in that it has a wide variety of musicians. But due to some of the songs winey, high pitched singing, it really doesn't represent one of the better sides of ska. This CD is a poor compilation that only has a few good songs to pull it through."
2,Disappointing mix,"Mr. DeFrancesco is a brilliant jazz organist and really wails on a couple of cuts, a la Jimmy Smith. Unfortunately, there are many 'urban contemporary' ballads that detract from the high points. If your taste runs to 'smooth jazz' (which mine doesn't) you'll enjoy this. I plan to get more of his albums since this was cut >10 years ago and is probably not representative of his best work."
3,Music That I Enjoy,"This is a great look into the young Joey. I believe this is his first CD, and the one that brought him praise. It followed his touring with Miles Davis, in the late 80s. A young graduate of Curtis Institute, a true South Philly boy, he packed extremely fast hands that could outrun a true breed in the Kentucky Derby. Or, at least at the Belmont Stakes! This is not his greatest recording, as he was still 'fresh' (just look at the cover, for pete's sake!), but check out his musical genius on 'L.G. Blues'. Amazing for such youth. But, hey, he got something from his old man, didn't he?! What do you know, John Coltrane, Sun Ra, Elliott Levin and Rocky Balboa, Scram, and the Cheezsteak, oh and the 1980 Phillies are only some of the pride Philly has."
4,The Audience Was Asleep,"This disk would've been much, much funnier if the audience had been able to get the jokes. They didn't seem to understand anything that wasn't spelled out for them, which Frank did with his hilarious John Madden impression. They apparently subscribe to the idea that Jay Leno is a comedian.Frank himself was good. His voice work is amazing, hitting everyone dead on. My favorite was his Casey impression as ROBIN from the SUPERFRIENDS. I was a little disappointed that his Al Pacino impression was tacked on at the end as a non-live track that really didn't make any sence. Other than that, he was great on this."
1,Rock hard....,"Seriously, if you lay down in bed too fast, you can crack your head open on this ""pillow"". I use quotes because there's nothing pillowy about this pillow. It should be advertised as a bed brick. Trust me, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR."
3,"Lots of efforts into making a mediocre, somewhat amusing film.","When two members of a gay boy band are brutally murdered, they naturally assign a homophobic detective (James Vallo), partnered with a flamboyantly gay new transfer from Los Angeles (Shawn Quinlan), to solve the crime. After the false arrest of a parish priest, as additional murders start to pile up, the FBI sends in a serial killer profiler (gay comedian Ant), who convinces them not to pursue the one real clue they have: a mysterious nun, seen in the area before each murder.With cameos by Bruce Villanch as a farmer, Judy Tenuta as the aforementioned nun, and porn puppy Brent Corrigan as an oversexed frat boy, this politically-incorrect, campy romp has zero realism, numerous fart jokes, tired stereotypes galore, and an epidemic of chronic overacting. Not that there is anything wrong with that, if that is what you enjoy. I found it amusing in places, but otherwise an unoriginal bore. Three stars out of five."
2,"TOTAL CRAP, MUCH?","Okay, I rented this sorry excuse for a movie to see Brent Corrigan and he was there... far about 2 minutes. I have no seen so many offensive stereotypes and crude gay jokes thrown into one film.If you want to watch something good, get JUDAS KISS. Lord, I wasted 90 minuntes and $2.99!Randy"
1,Simply Awful,"I paid $2.99 to rent this movie from Amazon VOD. That was $2.99 too much. Had it been free on Netflix or Amazon Prime, I would have turned it off. As it was, I played it to the end, but after about 10 minutes I had to mute the volume. I basically made up my own dialog to go along with what was happening on screen. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone unless it were free, but I myself would never watch this again even if it was free."
1,This is worth ZERO stars,"I've seen some 'turkeys' on screen in the past 40 years, but this one has to be the biggest 'gobbler' of them all! It gives Indie filmmakers a bad name. The acting and the direction (camerawork and sound) is god-damn awful. Don't waste your money on this one. But hey, this is only my opinion. I'm sure there would be some out there who who would enjoy this 'way-over-the-top campy' film."
5,Nikon Prostaff ATB 8x25,"These are my first pair of binoculars. I bought these due to many suggestions from the birdwatching community. I will be using them for hunting and whale watching. I would suggest staying with the lower power magnification unless using a tripod, because all movements are magnified (pardon the pun :) when viewing. Would recommend these to anyone looking for great quality for a reasonable price."
2,Nikon Binoculars are FRAGILE,"These are the most fragile binoculars I have ever owned. If you drop them two inches with the case on, they will need to go back for repairs. I swear this to be the truth. Two inches in the case, out of alignment, $22.50 for repair and shipping. If they are so fragile, they need to provide a better case!!!! I traded them in for the Nikon 8x42 Monarch ATB"
2,below expectations,"I got interested in geisha culture after watching Memoirs of Geisha and then reading the same named book, and then buying more and more books about geisha. Out of everything I've read so far,I found "" Madame Sadayakko.."" to be the least interesting one. It's very biographical. The language and the contents of the story is very dull. Besides the author going back and forth refering to the events,which have happenned in the past and will happen in the future. I understand that the mission of the book was to provide historical accounts of Madame Sadayako's life and geisha traditions. But taking in the account the name of the book, it fell below my expectations. I still don't see how this Geisha bewitched the West."
5,what a story!,"Cunningly released a year before the centenary of Madama Butterfly's first performance, this wonderful book is part love story, part adventure and part theatrical memoir. Sada Yakko was the first woman to step onto a Japanese stage in centuries, and also the first Japanese woman to achieve international fame. Painted by Picasso and an inspiration to Puccini, her first lover was the Japanese prime minister, and her husband was a leading light of the New Wave in the Japanese theatre. From early days in penury, when her troupe had to literally sell off some of the younger actors, to the heights of stardom and her finding of true love in later years, this is a wonderful biography from Lesley Downer. It has TV series written all over it."
3,Well... The Other Body Count Stuff Is Much Better,"Hmm... while the intro reminds of the cop-killer intro of the first cd, the rest kinda lacks the kicking vocals and music of the other 2 albums... the best song is ""My Way"" which is actually one of the best BC songs, also not bad are ""You're Fu**in' with BC"" and ""Violent Demise"", but still i miss the power and agression of the first 2 albums. so go for ""Cop Killer (which now is censored and called ""Body Count"") or ""Born Dead"""
1,didn't work for dell 700m,I bought one of these modules for my dell 700m. Installed it easily but once every few days my system crashes or I get a blue screen. I contacted kingston and they said that this module hasn't been tested on dell machines and is configured to work on generic computers only! I wouldn't recommend this memory for dell 700m users.
2,Icky smell,"I put up with the smell because so many people said it did wonders for their hair. I used it for almost a month and finally gave up because it was too heavy for my hair and didn't change the breakage I was having. I personally love their intense hair mask, but couldn't make it through the bottle of this stuff. I use ""It's a 10"" instead for my conditioner now and it seems to work wonders for my hair (fragile and fine)."
2,Not worth the money..,"Don't waste your money on this, it is overpriced and I did not notice a difference in my hair while using it. Try Loreal's Nature's Therapy Mega Moisture instead! It makes my hair unbelievably smooth and healthy!"
4,Took a while to see the results...,"The day I was to come on and write a negative review, I woke up and my hair was so shiny and soft. I had been using this product for a while, and didn't notice any changes, and my hair was breaking more than ever. So after finally seeing shine and softness, I took a shower and noticed that only a few strands of hair fell out, much different than the usual handful. I started combing the conditioner through with a comb, and that really helped. Also it smells clean and fresh, not like some of that fruity smelling shampoo which I hate. So all in all I LOVE this conditioner, it just might take a while to see the results!"
4,B rate satisfaction,"The book was in good condition, just as ordered. It arrived timely and worked out great. There were no complications and it was an easy buy. B rate satisfaction. I found out from my professor that she had made a mistake and this was not the right book, so I had to return the book though : But it was easy to return, and all I had to pay was for the retun shipping cost. Understandable."
4,Great,"This was a bizarre little book. It is a retelling of an old Welsh legend - a legend of a curse that is relived in each generation, again and again, in the same Welsh Valley. The main characters are Allison and Roger who are Step Siblings and Gwen is the son of the flitch - the wise man of the valley.The book captivated and I could not put it down. Various kinds of discrimination and prejudice pervade the plot and the book is full of dark twisty turns in the plot and sub-plots, one of which is the condensation of the English to the Welsh and its corollary in the Welsh resentment of English wealth. The class divide is on many different levels: between a working class boy and richer children, between a land-owning family and a businessman's family and finally there is the divide between urban Welsh and the Welsh-speaking country people. It was a fantastic book and as I stated earlier I could not put it down.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"
2,Can somebody tell me what's going on?,"I don't agree with the other reviews when they gave five stars for The Owl Service. The cover and the back of the book looked interesting, so I picked it up at the library and started to read. The next thing I know, I'm lost in the book, trying to figure out if I skipped a page or something. The book was really confusing and didn't really make any sense at all by the end. The myth about the love triangle was really weird and perplexing, and it's hard to figure out how that event is reanacting itself all over again with Alison, Roger, and Gwyn. Also, that whole ending with the flowers and everything... it's beyond my comprehension and probably some others too."
1,Awful!,"I liked the mystery and aura this book started off with, but the ending was disappointing and didn't deserve the wonderful build-up to the story. The proof of this is the way Gwyn was filling out the prophesy the way they thought it was and then suddenly Roger bursts in and says,""Flowers!"" and the story crashes down around the ending. I detested this ending!"
3,Hard to understand,"The Owl Service is one of those books that should have been edited more carefully. The plot is good, and the characters are thoroughly developed. The problem lies with the writing. Difficult to follow at times, it meanders along, never really explaining what is happening. The love triangle is the most confusing of all, especially the old myths. There are, of course, some touchingly sweet moments that I wanted to read over and over again, but they do not make up for the difficult passages elsewhere."
1,Worst book I ever read,The only reason I finished this book was because I had to review it. The writing is horrible. I have no idea how this book was ever published.
2,"Interesting ideas, poor storytelling","I read this book a while back and it certainly stuck in my memory, but not very comfortably. I recall the characters as unrealistic and the ending as nearly incomprehensible. I have read several of Garner's other books (not counting his folk tale anthology, which is excellent), and have found them full of big themes and striking images but poorly constructed. They always seem to promise more than they deliver.Susan Cooper does the same thing better."
3,Best for more mature readers,"Like several other reviewers (see the many excellent plot summaries on this page), I first read this book in elementary school because I'd enjoyed Garner's other books so much, and I too found it very strange and disturbing. However, the memory of it stuck with me for years, and I ended up rereading it recently as an adult; it made much more sense this time (knowing the adult-themed myth added another dimension too). This is definitely aimed at a more emotionally mature age group than Garner's other books, and younger kids will be disappointed. However, the fact that so many people remember it decades after their first reading suggests it has something unusual to offer older readers."
4,very very strange...,"Definitely NOT a book for most children. I read THE OWL SERVICE many years ago in part because I had enjoyed Garner's earlier books so much. I remember having nightmares afterwards, and steered clear of it subsequently. At the same time, the book stuck with me, and when I saw it in a used book shop a while ago I picked it up and re-read it. Second time through it is captivating, haunting, disturbing, and yes, very very strange. perhaps the perfect book to curl up with on a rainy autumn afternoon and find oneself going somewhere where the real and the possible somehow get turned inside out and we end... I am not sure where. I'd be reluctant to give this to other than a very mature child, but if you have one, he or she may well be entranced. I know I am."
4,The Client,"This was a great book from the get go. If you want a book that you'll not want to put down this is it. Once you start, your in for a treat. He has a way of making you feel like your right there with them throughout the story. This kid is the Man of his house and he's only eleven, but he does scary things far beyond his years. Enjoy, I'm already on to my next Grisham Book.The Client"
5,Quick delivery. Love this book and wanted a hardcopy of it,Love this book and wanted a hardcopy of it. Read it several times since 1994. John Grisham is really good
5,I just Amazingly NOW,"When I first heard this on vinyl it made my big toe stand right up in my boot.It""s been a long time since I have heard such a truly sonic challenge become resolved on the vinyl format and it makes me happy to know that there are people like me out there that are truly FREAKS.Freaks that care enough to take the time. I bet these guys wash their hands everytime, like me!"
1,barely used,"Barely used this item. I could not get the wrapping off for starters. When I used it on mushrooms, it scrapped off a lot of good mushroom. Oh, well."
5,Good Book,"1. Osborne is a strong, persuasive writer. Much of the book's appeal lies in his ability to express historical concepts in everyday English and in his use of diverse and compelling scenarios to prove his point. Indeed, The Revolution of The Mentally Dead touches upon everything from the 1800s to military combat in a way that will make readers look at their own lives a little bit differently. The revolution of the mentally dead is thought provoking and intelligent; it's also fun to read. Though convincing, it is not conclusive -and ultimately, each reader will have to decide what to keep and what to leave behind."
5,The Revolution of The Mentally Dead delivers X Factor,"3. The Revolution of The Mentally Dead delivers more than the X Factor of Black history ; it is an intelligent and challenging look at racial politics in Today's society (and by extension in the rest of the developed African American History). It is a brutally honest book that, many who will have read it, will have to re-read again to understand it. By far this will be one book you must have on your bookshelf for years to come."
1,A luke warm attempt to gather the masses of awareness,"Building on traditional Liberal values and principles, Osborne brings new and often provocative thinking to every area of social Topics. He seems to have the need to encourage and support stable and secure families, a tougher prisons regime and stronger local government - as well as proposals for global governance reform and integration. A Luke warm attempt to gather the masses of awareness amongst a group of people who are and will always be a disease with their selves ..."
3,Not what I imagined....,"This novel has gotten mixed reviews - some good, some bad. I will rate in the middle with *** stars.It was very slow and took me a couple weeks to make it to the half-way mark, but I was bound & determined to finish it.Once I got through the middle, the plot held my interest until the end. I wish I could say that from start to finish. :-("
3,Tinseltown - The Awful Truth,"This is a Hollywood roadmap; I found it rings true and amazingly awful because it's raw, feelings are passe, and women don't rule until Alex Davidson hits the mark and let's herself make a stand to help keep her dignity and her job.Gossip, gossip, and more gossip. Hollywood uncovered."
3,Cute for a first book,This book had me laughing in some spots and other places I was kinda lost... I will be reading more of her books as they come out.. The charters were all very strong and it seems that from the things that happened to Alex and the way she handles all that is thrown at her I think this book is well written.. I read this book in just 2 days..
1,booooooooring,"I wanted to love this book because I love light, gossipy novels but it was just plain dull. The main character, Alex, shows no personality at all. In fact they were all quite one-dimensional. The very slight element of suspense that substitutes for a plot line didn't show up until very late in the book. I thought I'd enjoy guessing who the Hollywood characters were meant to be but I was just too bored to bother. This is a book that you should read in one afternoon by the pool but it took me days to get through because I just didn't care."
1,Could barely get through this,"I really enjoy chick lit, but there's enjoyable chick lit and then there are books like these. The main character, Alex, whined about everything and she had to stress over every little thing, even when it didn't seem like that big of a deal. I didn't think it was written well and after reading the phrase ""made noises"" (about making plans) for the 10th time, the end of the book couldn't have come sooner. Also, as someone who is actually from Bucks County, I found it incredibly irritating for her to keep mentioning the county over and over again when the towns she named (Upper Darby and Bryn Mawr) aren't even in Bucks! I know it's fiction, but you can't rearrange actual geography to your liking."
2,Difficult to get through,"I found this book very boring and negative. It was discouraging because Alex, the main character of the novel seemed to endlessly complain about her job and Hollywood. I wanted to scream, ""If you hate Hollywood so much, then get the heck out of there!"" I also found it very hard to get through. I normally read 'chic lit' books in one or two sittings, but it seemed to take me forever to get through this one. There wasn't an exciting plot. The climax of the story wasn't until the end, and even then my interest was still not heightened. I did learn a bit about Hollywood and became completely turned off by the scene. I suppose if you work in the field the book could be entertaining, but otherwise I would suggest that it's a waste of time."
2,Falls flat...,"If I weren't so interested in PR, I would have found this too boring to read through. To be fair, de Vries knows enough about Hollywood entertainment PR to make this a believable story...until a rather unrealistic twist of fate that brings a rather slow-moving plot to a happy ending.Maybe it's because I don't like just any chick lit book, but this story just moved too slowly for me and Alex was a little too much of a navel gazer to have much sympathy for her."
1,Should have stopped reading after 5 minutes,"I was disappointed in this book. It seemed like something that the author rushed out using a standard Hollywood plot outline. I didn't have any sympathy or hatred for any of the characters, and didn't really care at all. I thought the characters were pale stereotypes of people. I definitely don't recommend this book to anyone."
2,So boring,I tried reading this book but could not find anything entertaining about it. It's horrible. Do not purchase!!
3,Disappointed in the way it is written,"This would have been a very good story if it didn't have so much swearing in it. The story line is very good and very interesting and it is very humorous; however there must be a swear word on almost every page. The f word is used consistently, some times 2 or 3 times on a page. Even though I know that people talk like this, it is very disturbing that a career woman would use such language. It is also disgusting to read this. Apparently, the author is not very well versed in vocabulary. There are a lot of other very expressive or colorful words that could be used. Foul and slang language insults my intellence. I usually keep good books that I read, but even though the story was good, this is not one I care to keep on my shelf. I find that I wasted my money on this one."
2,Hollywood Shmollywood,I am not entirely sure how this book got as many stars as it did. It really wasn't that great. The main character Alex was not a nice person at all. She's whiny and seems to think way too much of herself when bothers to think at all. Her best bud Rachel is snotty and over the top. The other main characters are not much likable either. The development of the non-central characters was pretty bad too. I'll cite C Se. as an example. She was quite obviously J Lo. but for God's sake just say so or don't try to pretend she is someone else. Come up with something original at least. I am giving the book 2 stars because I actually liked the plot (when they finally got to it that is). Too bad the unlikable characters ruined it. I didn't mind the cut throat image of Hollywood. I actually expected that -- I just wanted a character to like. A good girl stuck in a bad world if you will.
2,"eh, not as good as i expected","i was expecting this book to be a fun dishy novel, like nanny diaries or the devil wears prada...instead, it was plotless, and although it was a quick read and i can't say i didn't enjoy it, after i finished reading it, i was left thinking ""wait...what was the whole point of that book???"". i would definitely recommend picking up the devil wears prada instead!"
2,Long and Drawn out,"I love to read gossipy, Hollywood type books. I just could not get into this one. I found myself continuosly going back to the jacket to remember what I was suppose to be reading about. I finished only because I hate to buy a book and not finish it. The character, Alex, complains then complains again. O.K. now what, start a plot already. About halfway the plot visualizes and it's not that bad after that. I would not reccomend this book if you are looking for excitement throughout."
4,Totally Fun Read!,"I thought that So 5 Minutes Ago was such a great book! I couldn't put it down. If you've always wanted to know what it's like to be in the entertainment industry, read this book! It's a hilarious story and would definately be a great read for a trip to the beach. :)"
1,Don't Bother,"A cute start, then just went downhill from there. None of the characters were the least bit interesting--even the main character. I was hoping Troy or someone would step up to the plate to give the story some glimmer of hope, but it didn't happen--nothing happened in the whole story."
4,The Stick up Kids,"This was a good movie, it had real substance and historical value. I did the research on Manhatten and found it to be on point. while their method may not have been the best approch (Robin Hoodist) the point of making conrtibutions to our community and to others were clear. We have to both invest in our own and become knowledgable about vision. Vision is not what you see but how you see it, it is not want you see but seeing what it can become."
5,Black & Proud - Scientific - Hip - Sophisticated,"I love this movie. It is entertaining but yet documentary/commentary. Very well done. The message, while delivered in the context of an African American experience, is universal to all interested in creating a better tomorrow."
2,decent,definitely a good message. all young adults need to see this movie. the action couldve been more seamless. Glad I got to watch this through a promo because I wouldnt have purchased it.
5,WHY IS IT NOT ON DVD?,"The story follows the book as expected. Not every detail would be transferred from the book into the movie. And I knew that and yet I really enjoyed it. I've never expected it to be that good. It was no worse than the book and some scenes with the dead dogs felt realistic. The music is exceptional. I've searched for it but found no soundtrack or anything. Was pretty upset, just like about the fact that I can't get it on dvd."
2,Getting Hooked,"I have had my Aroma grill for six months. Within 3 months the teflon started wearing off (I only washed in soapy water using paper towels), the screw that holds the handle in the lid kept coming loose (today my dishwasher took care of that, it swallowed it whole), and the plastic feet that hold the grill into the base broke (the second time I took the grill out of the base). On the other hand, the food prepared in the grill was unbelievable. It is unfortunate such a good product is so poorly constructed."
5,It is a must have.,"If you deal with creativity, visual perception and design... You have to read it."
5,Endless supply of inspiration,"Whenever I need to reset my thinking about a particular problem, this is the book I reach for. It is essentially an entire book of prompts to get your mind moving again. I find it an irreplaceable source of inspiration for new ideas.It is also just fun to open it up, let fall open at a random pages and start reading."
5,You can't do without this book.,"Stop what you're doing. Buy The Art of Looking Sideways right now. Read it, view it, participate in it. It will change the way you see the world."
2,Pretentious,"First, read the title of this review.Now, go read some of the five star reviews.Right now. Go read them.Are you back? Good.If those reviews made you feel sick to the stomach, angry, patronized, or confused, this book is not for you. This is a book that was made for the coffee tables of higher-middle class, ""artistically"" inclined intellectuals for the sake of making themselves feel better. By writing this review, I'm actually helping them, because I'm just one more person who ""doesn't get it,"" because they, presumably, do.If you're happy being an unsophisticated philistine with no creativity who can't think outside the box, then you best move along."
5,The book is full of ideas waiting to be created by you.,"I buy books at random, not by selection. I look at something on the shelf and decided if it's inspiring to have. The Art of Looking Sideways is just that, the perspective is left up to the reader. You can flip through its randomness and find something that will spark your imagination and creativity. The book is so big that every time I look through it, I always find something new to read, enjoy, and ponder.Like any art book, this ISN'T for everyone. This is for someone that can respect anything that's everything created by and made out of nothing. If you want to be intrigued, or just want something interesting to read, this is the book."
5,SUPER Sturdy!,"When I bought these, the price was $32 and I thought they were relatively inexpensive tea tables to for the patio. When I received them and my husband assembled them, I realized they are really harty. I can sit on them and could sit much heavier things and people on them.After receiving them, I started researching polywood and I realized at $32, I made quite a steal. A month after I bought them, the price went up to $88, otherwise I would have bought some for my parents. Great product!"
4,Tasty!,"Taste fantastic! Somewhat hot if you consume a lot of it at once, but nothing to be fearful of. It's the perfect hand-made taste hot sauce to replace your over-the-counter Cholula/Tapatio for all of you meal choices."
1,Bland. No taste of hananero. Not hot.,I bought this at a local super market. Takes like chilie powder. Not very spicy. Could not taste any habanero. So boring I had to mix it with dave insanity sauce and eventually gave up on finishing the bottle.
2,"Great start but degenerates to the ""them against us""","Once Al Sharpton and Wynton Marsalis opened their pie-holes, it started going downhill. And the usual rants about picking on ""us people"" (regardless of color) with the usual results got pretty tired. All the blame for the late response was well-deserved to the Bush Administration and all the machinery under it.If you read books about how all the red-tape of beaurocracy, paranoia, trickle-down theories and turf-wars (which the video doesn't really cover in detail) lead to all the delays, you'll be embarrassed as an American. Especially, if you know America's response for emergencies to other countries (i.e. We are usually the first to offer with help from Gov't and private donations. And the first to arrive)."
1,When the levies broke,Spike Lee essentially blames the US Government for the careless acts of those who did not abide to an evacuation order.
5,When the Levees Broke,This is a superbly done piece on Hurricane Katrina. My hat is off to Spike Lee.
3,Katrina Review,The video was good but did not show enough of the mayor's and the goverments failure to help these poor people. I would like to have seen more footage and less talking. We especially didn't need Reverend Al. He is always there for the photo shoot but has he done anything to help?
4,Impressive,A very impressive documentary which keeps you wondering: where was and is the federal government and what does New Orleans look like two years after?
5,One pleased customer!,Beautifully packaged and arrived on time. Never have I shopped anywhere online and had my product arrive as timely as from Amazon. I'm vere pleased with the content and customer service.
5,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!,"Spike did an excellent job. I was able to see and hear first hand all that occurred surrounding Hurricane Katrina! Although, it was so sad and depressing, I'm grateful that the truth was told. This movie is a must have in ones library!"
3,Needs better production,"This CD is a collection of early rants from Dennis Miller's TV show. This is a great CD, but being his first, I think Miller still hasn't come into a good flow yet. I recommend his later CD's which are far better.Also, the cheesy production value really takes from the CD. There is really bad synth music between each track, and I wish they had taken the rant straight from the show. I miss the audience laughter (or lack of laughter) that Dennis plays off of.If you're a Dennis Miller fan, it's still a good purchase, but not the best."
2,disappointing,he has a few clever observations which were overshadowed by his lack of creativity in his choice of obscenities.
5,Chalk another one up for Den. This book ruled.,"Snappy, cutting remarks that make you say ""Ya I hear ya Den-man. An Impressive writeup that dropped the hammer on every thing from O.J. to infomercials. Another wound to the inner child of anyone who got on Miller's bad side. Of coarse that's just my opinion I could be wrong"
1,Rather Dull,"The audio version is Miller reading, without much inflection in his voice, and without an audience giving any feedback. Small musical intros lead into each tirade. The result is something that sounds more like a lecture by a sociology professor on drugs, but less entertaining. Occasionally something warrants a small smile, but overall it is one of the most boring, least funny ""comedy"" CDs that I have ever heard."
2,It has about 10 funny pages out of 200,"This book contains hardly any funny rants about anything. He just talks about how much he hates everything but does not point out anything funny about the things that he hates. It is worth reading if you get it at the library, but do not buy it."
2,Rants become boring,"Not anything I haven't ""ranted' about except not with the dry humor of Miller. I just got tired of it half way through."
1,Where's the funny?,"Read this hoping for a few laughs. Instead it was a series of obvious observations told in a manner that was uninteresting. The attempt at humor was forced, and thus failed."
4,The Art Of Shouting Your Mind,"Dennis Miller's rants combine hilarity and brutal honesty and with his gift of insight, his intellect, and his candor, Miller toes the line between coolness and utter jerkdom as he yells his views on topics that range from politics to popular culture. Miller is surprisingly patriotic, deeply cynical, individualistic, and often mildly insulting. I found his trademark obscure cultural references charming at first but they do grow old after a while. (Not that Miller cares.) The thing that won me over here is that unlike so many other motormouths in the entertainment business, Dennis Miller truly has something thoughtful to say and the points he makes are generally worth thinking over."
4,Steps back a bit....,"Good solid effort by this band that I like a lot...BUT..A little too slick and synthy..that's my only beef. ""My Paradise"" and ""The Night Ain't Over"" are my fav's on here. And I had forgotten all about ""Shelter Me"" which it nice. There are are few weak tracks, though, like ""Makin' Up"" but, nothing really to complain about! I just got this CD this week to replace the original cassette that I had purchased when this came out in '89. I loaned it out and never got it back."
3,Great game for beginners,"I think that this is a good game for beginners to enter off-road racing. It teaches you spin recovery, and finding short cuts. There is a nice selection of Hummers, with the H1, H2, and H3 included, along with specialized variants of them. You can also customize them to your liking. The graphics on this game are quite impressive as well and I constantly find myself saving replays since the graphics and camera views during the replay always seem to be just right.However, I don't quite like the tracks because you are always are told about what is coming up before the race, and the tracks can become quite predictable and easily won and that's just for the tournament. There is an extreme off-road category of this game, but in my opinion, it's not so extreme. And there is always a time limit or opponents, and no mode to just look around on your own. However, if you are an experienced off-road racer, I would suggest you give Test Drive Off-Road Wide Open a try."
3,good resource in spite of the silliness,"I thought that this book had a lot of west coast hippie sensitivity and silliness... I would have liked something a bit more straightforward with fewer trippy explorations of feelings. However, there isn't a whole lot of stuff out there on lesbian polyfidelity - so its a good resource for women who are learning about this relationship style."
2,Terrible teaching tool for the uninitiated!,"This book presents complex subject matter in extremely complex engineeringese (contrary to English). There is little attention paid to establishing a base of reference on which to build. The author assumes the reader has fluent knowledge of complex mathematics and wastes no time or space in an attempt to explain his assumptions or algebraic leaps to the ""most simplified form."" The practice problems are virtually impossible to solve and bear slight or no resemblence to the grossly inadequate examples.All in all a very frustrating book."
3,Signals & Systems,"The condition of the book was okay but the seller forgot to mention what the edition of the book is! However,the shipping time was good."
4,Sticky stuff,"I am just learning to salmon fish. I haven't caught anything on Smelly Jelly, but then again I haven't caught anything salmon at all this year. I can say that this stuff stick to your lures VERY WELL. A good friend I fish with nails Chinook on the Anchovy flavor with a Blue Fox spinner. I can't say for certain that it has any added value, but as my skill improves I will do more testing. It seems very popular locally (Sacramento area)."
1,No Show!,If I could give a negative star I would. I received the wrong books then when I called they said they no longer carried the books I needed...so I had to reorder somewhere else.
4,all good,"I recommended it, came in a short time, for his versatility and will recommend to all my fellow des fishing."
1,ugh!,"poop, i didn't need the book because my prof. didn't specify which edition i needed. it turns out the first day of class she tells us we need the 8th edition."
2,What Could Have Been,"This has to be one of the hardest books to review. Much of the acclaim in the friends' reviews is true. The Welkening is a complex tale, three dimensional, clever, unique, fresh, innovative. The glich is, there are so many problems in the writing, the story is hard to follow. Would that Gregory Spencer, such an imaginative mind, had spent more time learning the craft of fiction. Or that his editors had helped him with things like repetition, poor transitions, weak set up and absent foreshadowing, baffling character motivation, and muddled point of view. This story had the potential to be great. Instead it may well languish on shelves because no one cares enough about the characters to persevere. Too bad. The Welkening contains, in small doses, some of the most inventive language. If only Spencer had Tolkienized his story, even a little ..."
2,"Creative Idea, but . . .","I tried to read this book for an independent study project for school, but after just a few pages in I begged my professor to let me swap in another book. The idea of a three-dimensional tale is creative and interesting, but the writing style of this book is so poor I couldn't take the book seriously. The characters fell flat and were too cartoonish--not representations of real people. I couldn't bring myself to care about them, and consequently couldn't finish their story."
2,a modern (commercial ?) record ...,"My review will be short: the vocalists on this album have got very little to do with hard rock & metal, so don't expect any miracles. This may be the way Tony likes his music to sound now, but I miss the originality, the feel and the attitude of Black Sabbath. I'm still waiting for a retro-style Iommi effort, and I hope he'll take the risk one day ..."
2,Not Very Good,"I bought this album because I love Black Sabbath and especially Tony Iommi's guitar work, but this album doesn't sound like Iommi at all, it sounds like metal, but there aren't many signature Iommi licks, and the songs aren't that good. Even with the broad range of vocalists featured, this album sucks."
4,The hard rock _Supernatural_,"To put it simply, this album rocks. It doesn't even matter who the vocalists are on this CD. All the songs are great, especially ""Time Is Mine,"" which features Pantera's Phil Anselmo and ""Black Oblivion,"" which features Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins. This is an excellent hard rock CD and one of the better albums to be released in 2000."
5,IOMMI rules But...,"IOMMI's guitar work is as always perfect, awesome sound and riffs galore, but some of the singers on this album suck ass, the system of the down crapass guy and the MEat losers ruins one of the songs each they sing on the sound is great but their voice ruins it. Lucky for them IOMMI is on guitars to save their loserassess. Most of the other artists are great save those two. great album but metals best guitarist."
3,Most songs are good.,"There's a lot of novelty in the various guest vocalists--I bought it for Dave Grohl, Billy Corgan, Serj Tankian and of course Ozzy. Obviously, there's a lot of metal guitar, and a majority of the time it's pretty excellent metal. If you're an Ozzy/Black Sabbath fan, you'll dig the guitar here because, of course, Iommi was Black Sabbath's guitarist.I'm generally impressed with it, but one or two tracks might be a little below expectations--I felt that way about the track with Tankian singing, but it may well have been because of him more than because of Iommi.As always, take a listen to two or three tracks before buying this one. If you like more than two, it's a safe bet that you'll be satisfied."
2,Change your name,"Well at least Tony stopped hiding behind the Black Sabbath name and finally made it on his own. If I remember correctly, The Eternal Idol was suppose to be a project with Glenn Hughes. If this was the best that Tony could do, then this shouldn't have been released."
3,No color,"So im litening to the cd now and im not very impressed at all but because its tony the god father of metal i gave it 3 stars. I look at a cd as colors and this cd is purley black and white. All the song sound generally the same, w/ a few added riffs which i thought were kinda pathetic to wut iommi used to do. The vocalist for most of the tracks are terrible, even ozzy's track sucked. Dont get me wrong i love sabbath infact that y i bought the cd in the first place, god knows i have everything sabbath. I think Iommi should hang it up for awhile and go back to the drawing board."
1,"canton,ma.","even the jurassic park scientists couln't revive this old dinosaur of a guitar player.oh! they had a special on vh1, about black sabbath,i couldn't understand why,at this date and time and look a few months later there's a niomi solo album.oh! and look the people that were remarking about the album on vh1 a few months later just so happen to be on this cd clever marketing scheme.unlike some of the other guitar players from the 80's he couln't even put out an instrumental he's not good enough.he needed help from brian may.so he figured ill get these singers and then all of their fans will buy this.(it dosn't work like that) you can't had bad guitar under the cover of grunge music...."
4,Cant complain.,"Well, this is an allright album. i'm a big Tony Iommi fan, so hey, i gotta review it. this is basically Tony's solo effort, with a different band for each track. it sounds sorta 'nu-metal'-ish, cause the way the riffs are, but they're really cool, cause it's not just two power chords over and over. AND IT HAS SOLOS! SOLOS RULE! Especially Tony Iommi solos! but the best thing on this disk has to be ""The Laughing Man(In the Devil Mask)""(With Henry Rollins, known for preaching 'the virtues of black sabbath'), ""Patterns""(With Serj Tankian. I think this is better than ANY SOAD song. ever), and of course ,the track with Ozzy. It's ALMOST Black Sabbath! (No Geezer Butler?!). It even sounds like the song ""Black Sabbath"".. even has bells tolling at the start.All in all, it's fairly good, and a must have if you're an Iommi fan. but it's not what you'd expect, and takes a bit to get into."
4,NEXT BEST THING TO A NEW SABBATH CD,"Those of you who gave on Iommi after he ""dumped"" the stoned-out Ozzy from SAB in the late 70's, can forgive him now and go buy this CD. It has those slow, distorted, eerie riffs that gives goose bumps to any self-respecting BS fan. The songs and vocals are spacey, almost psychedelic in nature and the lyrics are appropriately evil and unintelligible. What surprised me the most was how good the vocals are by the ""guest singers"" and how they suit the songs. If you love the fast ""speed-metal"", it ain't for you....it's ""old-school"" metal from the 1971-76 years [and that's a GOOD thing] Surprisingly, the only song that has OZ singing on it ain't the best one....go figger. Sorry, Tony, I had to deduct a star because of the total ""SAB""-sence of Geezer, but if you multiply 4 stars by 2, that makes 8....git it? Buy the friggin' CD, already!"
4,Heard on Bob and Tom,"I woke this morning to hear Tony on the Bob and Tom Show, a syndicated show out of Indianapolis. They played 2 cuts and they were great. Tony released this album ala Santana, with fresh blood recording with him. Ozzy even appears on a track or two. Sounded great. Go get it"
4,The Dark Lord of Metal Reigns Supreme,"Tony Iommi's dark and weighty riffs are the stuff from which all great heavy metal has been born. Here, the genius behind the sound of Black Sabbath proves that he is still among the best at making heavy rock music. While none of the riffs here is likely to stick like a knife blade in the head ala ""Ironman"" or ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,"" Iommi has definitely re-discovered his muse with this CD. Almost all of the collaborations here work very well and the pieces co-written with Skin, Dave Grohl, and Phil Anselmo (whose band Pantera is normally one of the worst excuses for heavy metal going) being particularly fab. This record has all of the dark minor key thundering of the great classic Sabbath albums, but with a very modern feel. Fans of Sabbath and other great dark and heavy bands (like NIN, Metallica and Ministry) are bound to find things here they will enjoy."
4,This is really Iommi's 3rd solo album.,"In 1985 Tony Iommi laid Sabbath to rest & recorded a solo LP ""Seventh Star"". Because of record company pressure he released it as a Black Sabbath album. ""Seventh Star"" isn't bad but it sounds more like an 80s Deep Purple than Sabbath. (Ex-Purple Glen Hughes does the vocals). In 1996 Iommi recorded another solo album (also with Hughes) that was never released but was bootlegged under the title ""Eighth Star"". (That album is OK but redundent.) This time Iommi's album has a different vocalist for each track so no one could release it as a Sabbath effort!"
1,total perversion of a wonderful story,"We rented this out of our love for the Treasure Island story as well as our respect for Jack Palance's acting skills. While Mr. Palance performed well, the story itself was totally twisted. The ""good guys"" became the ""bad guys"" and the ""bad guys"" turned out to be actually the ""good guys"". Par for our modern PC culture which fortunately R. L. Stevenson knew nothing about (and yes, I have read the original story). SPOILER: the story ends by the ""hero"" Long John Silver sailing to Jamaica with Jim Hawkins and Ben Gunn (the ""good guys"" of the show were killed during a fight at the treasure -- but the story was so twisted that you were actually glad they received their ""just reward"" in death!). The only reason I rated this a ""1-star"" was because there was not a ""zero-star"" rating."
1,Absolutely horrible!,"I had high hopes for this film, as it has plenty of well-known actors. But this director/writer butchered the original story. He went far beyond taking liberties with it...he ruined it. The plot development is horrible...characters don't develop, they simply change in the time it takes to switch scenes. And as other reviewers have noted, the ending is probably the worst part of all. As I watched (painfully), I questioned if the director even bothered to read the book. He took a wonderful, rousing adventure and turned it into a sickening, useless film that I will never watch again, let alone buy."
2,"Interesting, some flaws","Good Pirate film. Should have been made more for the kids- there were some overly gory shots, and at times it was too wordy and lengthy for the kids. Good production value, cool sets and boats / costumes / set design was impressive. If you like Pirate films, this is for you."
1,Unbelievably awful,"Saw this film only once, and maybe I'm going blind, or the movie affected my brain somehow.....but did anyone else notice that in the closing credits to this horrible film that Jack Palance's name was spelled ""Plalance""? Gotta wonder who's got the reins when something like that slips by....."
3,A Kevin Zegers Must-Have,"Kevin Zegers and Jack Palance shine in this adaptation of the classic novel. You probably need a calculator to add up all the different versions of the film, and everybody agrees that the version starring Bobby Driscoll is by far the best - but this one is an enjoyable journey.The DVD itself is nothing to brag about with very limited ""special features"" - it is obvious it was cheaply produced but the video quality is good. Worth a viewing by any Kevin Zegers or Jack fan."
3,Sounds like a 90's album produced in the 80's,"The samples the band uses sound awful. The music is dated, but it's interesting...and an old favorite of mine. If you like old Nu Metal, you might like this."
3,Hmm....yeah,"I bought this for a buck,and I just wasn't feeling it.In an era of Hed pe,Downset,etc.This just doesn't compare.My opinion."
2,Epitome of Academic Dryness,"I read a lot, and more than a few books by academics. But even though I was keenly interested in the subject of this book, and what Fenster would have to say about it, I found the reading so utterly dry and boring that I couldn't get even a third of the way through the book. I put it down and came back to it several times, trying to bring a freshness to it. But each time I was drugged to catatonia within a few pages. I gave up trying to read it straight through, and tried skimming and jumping around to get some key points. It didn't help. The author appears more intent on scholarly notes and quotes and references, than on making a clear and readable narrative. Unless you are an academic doing research, or a lay reader with an iron stomach for this kind of material, I would find another book."
5,TV is awesome!,I shopped till I dropped but this TV had the best depth perception of all of them. Also I could view it at different angles it didnt seem like the light was centered in the middle. Great TV!
4,Attractive and reliable retractable key reel,This retractable key reel has a very strong reliable spring clip (with teeth). My only disappointment is that it doesn't extend as far as the other more colorful types.
2,Too expensive for what it is...,Ended up paying close to $12 due to shipping changes. The thing broke down about 2 months after purchase. Not worth the money unless you find it cheaper.
2,Badge holder,"I guess I did not look at the picture closely. The back is a hinged clip. If you put it on your belt or clothes it leaves a mark, and it also is subject to falling off. I've only had it for a few weeks and already lost my badge once as it fell off. Luckily a colleague found it in the hallway at work. I recommend you get one that has a slip on clip that you can attach to your belt."
4,Nice key chain,"I have all my keys (4-5, plus sometimes a key-less remote) on this and they are't too heavy for it like it won't come down and hang out. i love it because its very small and i can take my keys off and put on without any hassle at all because its a hook rather than a key ring. my only concerns are that the hinged claw will sometimes slip and wiggle around. it hasn't fell off on me because the clamp is strong, but it does move. also the size is a little short. its nice for me but a little more slack would be nice. other than that, i love it and use it everyday!"
3,"The string seems a little weak, but it has strong clips on both ends","I was a little disappointed with the string that retracts seems a bit easy to break, which is what happened to my last one of another brand/seller."
4,Krakauer makes a mountaineer out of us all,"Throughout Eiger Dreams, I not only relived my limited mountaineering experiences, but was carried to new heights in places I never dreamed I would go. Krakauer truly captures the experience you get from base to summit, as well as the hardships and very real dangers you face each time you step out of our neatly packaged world and into the ""real"" world of man not against nature, but man in union with nature"
4,"good stories, some better than others","Krakauer is a good writer, but some of these stories seem old and less well-written than his recent stuff."
4,Good stories,A good collection of Krakauer's writings. References to the Gunks and other climbing was fun. One thing a found amusing was that he seemed to equate anything hard or scary with unprotected 5.12 face climbing.
3,"Good, But No Close to ""Into Thin Air""","This book is written by the best selling author Jon Krakauer. He was the author and participant in the Everest disaster in 1996. He wrote about his experiences in ""Into Thin Air."" This was also an excellent book and was better than this work. Eiger Dreams is a collection of numerous articles that Jon Krakauer has written over the years that have been published in various magazine. This causes the book to have some excellent chapters and so weaker chapters. Also, this causes the book to jump around some on various mountain climbing topics. The book becomes more interesting as it goes deeper into the pages. The last few chapters are excellent. If you liked ""Into Thin Air"", you will enjoy this book but just not as much."
4,Good Read,"I got this book because I am interested in the subject of mountaineering. After reading a few books about Mt Everest, this collection of mountaineering and related adventure stories is a lot of fun and variety."
3,Amusing,"This is an amusing conglomeration of climbing stories. Humor, greed, suicide, and sheer bravery all included in these stories. Parts of these traits could be in a single story depending on which stage of the climb you are in. Written well, and it seems to put you right in touch with the climbs. However, through fault of the writer or of the storytellers themselves some of this seems to be a bit over the top. He could have been a mixing it up for entertainmnet value or for some other reason. But it should still be read by anyone who is into climbing."
3,Okay but....,"I loved Into Thin Air by Krakauer, so I purchased several of his other books, including this one. While the stories were interesting, it lacked the depth I enjoy from a book (likely because it appears to be reprints of magazine articles). It also seems that most (if not all) of these articles are 20+ years old. For the same price as this book I would been better off with a years subscription to Adventure magazine."
2,compilation of old magazine articles,"greatly enjoyed his other books this is one can safely be skipped. disjointed and mostly poorly written magazine articles thrown together in a book format. readable sure, just not very good."
4,"You can take Krakauer away from the mountain, but you can't take the mountain away from Krakauer","I chose to purchase this book based on the strength of 'Into Thin Air' and 'Under the Banner of Heaven', both of which I enjoyed immensely. I also enjoyed this book, although not as much. First, it was a very quick read, which is not surprising given that the book is a collection of article-length essays. Second, I did not find some of the subject matter as interesting as the material in his other books. Several of the essays in this book are still fascinating reads, particularly the ones pertaining to the history of mountaineering. Please note that this is a subjective opinion and does not reflect on Krakauer's writing style or quality; I just personally do not enjoy the topic of rock climbing as much as the author does. That said, his enthusiasm for the activity is obvious and it shows in his writing. If you loved 'Into Thin Air' and want more, this book is for you."
4,Eiger Dreams,"Jon Krakauer never disappoints. As with his other books he takes us along on one after another thrilling adventure from the safety of our easy chairs. Thank you, Jon."
4,Unusual Format but Good Book,"In this book Jon Krakauer tells the stories of expeditions, accidents, and incredible feats in mountaineering but instead of just telling one story, every chapter covers a different story from climbing in the French Alps and the nightlife of Chamonix to the origins of bouldering. I really enjoy how the book is set up with individual stories for every chapter."
3,Some decent stories well told,"This is a nice collection of stories decently told. While I enjoyed the book, the chapters (stories) had no unifying themes or characters, resulting in little attachment or sense of being there. By comparison, Touching the Void or Hermann Buhl: Climbing Without Compromise were both far more gripping."
1,annoyed,"I learned upon listening to the audio tape that there is a significant flaw in the first tape. Totally inaudible.I wrote to the company and express my distress with a request for refund/exchange, and got no response.Michele"
2,i rated this book because jon krakauer tells everything from,i rated it this because jon krakauer really writes the story bad. if he had written it in a more fasonable way it could of been better
3,Fun,"This is a nice collection of some of Krakauer's best articles alongside a new piece at the end. These stories were all written before Krakauer became famous and prove that he does have climbing bone fides. There is a nice cross section of the climbing world represented here. So many stories are written about Himalayan climbers (justifiably mind you) that it is refreshing to hear about some lesser know folks doing big things. The profile of the Burgess boys was quite amusing, I plan on reading their book in the near future. The Devil's Thumb piece at the end shows a nice bit of humility alongside the triumpth and makes you feel like you are there yourself. The best section is detailing the 1986 debacle of a summer on K2. That was a season that deserves more attention and I think Krakauer gave it a fair and balanced analysis."
3,Been there done that,I enjoyed the book well enough but felt like I had been through most of it already with Into Thin Air. I also wasn't smart enough to realize how old this book was until I got several pages into it. I felt like it was Krakauer so I would be OK and it was a decent enough read. I especially enjoyed reading about how difficult it is to spend life in a tent days on end. To summarize - over familiar yet still 10 times better than reading about Mormans
3,Not bad,"Lots of good little short stories. I found myself reading other books while I was reading this, which is usually a sign for me that it's not a book that has captured my complete attention. But Krakauer is a talented writer, and this book at points felt like an autobiography, which was interesting."
4,Krakauer shines again!,"This book was an action packed series of vinettes about some of the world's most remote places and the people who go there for fun. Krakauer included light hearted stories about the Burgess Brothers, and less light hearted stories, such as 1986, when there were so many fatalities on K2 thanks to Messner's new climbing techiques. My favorite was the last article, ""Devil's Thumb."" It talked about Krakauer's own struggles with the mountains, climbing and braving the cold. A wicked good book."
3,Too much of a good thing,"This book is a series of five gothic mystery novellas by Susan Howatch. The first one was entertaining, the second felt like I'd read it before and by the time I read the third one I knew that it would involve an innocent young woman, somehow married to an enigmatic older man who she suspects of committing murder. Unfortunately, she's trapped in an isolated home with a group of strangers for the weekend as she both falls in love with her new husband and finds clues to convince herself he's a murderer. All ends well, but the stories follow this very predictable pattern... different women, different husbands and locals, but the same story."
4,A great book...,Since another reviewer already gave the description from the back of the book I'd just like to say that I really enjoyed this book. This was the first book I've read by Judith Stacy & I was quite impressed. I like to have a good laugh now & then in my romance books & this book gave me that. This couple was very likable & enjoyable. This book even had a tiny bit of a mystery in it when it came to other people in the town & what they were all about which was also a big plus for me.I'd highly recommend this book.
3,Okay,"This was bought as a replacement to a safety lanyard I had for my crescent wrench that a co-worker lost when I loaned it to him. This lanyard works as it says, however, when you do need to extend beyond its retracted length, it is VERY stiff. Also, although the product dimensions state ""20 pounds"", the bright orange label on the lanyard itself very clearly states that it is only rated for 5 pounds."
3,Lanyard,"This tool lanyard work well with a c wrench, I would have liked a better carabiner since the one on it is kind of cheesy. Other than that it is a good product."
5,Great shelf to place on top of vertical file cabinet,This was packaged so that it slides right out of the box. The only thing you need to do is attach the rubber cushions on the bottom. Fits perfectly on top of my vertical filing cabinet. Deep enough to hold large binders.
5,This is it!!!,This is the ONLY wallet my husband will use. Bought them twice and even gave one for his friend cause he loves them so much.
3,coffin,"Coffin was an amazing character, as well a great journalist. Had insight when it came to the war, and also reported quite often from the camps themselves. The book was insightful and full of good tid-bits."
1,Deceived,"The watch after one month approximately stopped working. Despite my explicit request before purchasing (following the suggestion of anotehr purchaser), the International warranty Card was not filled and stamped by the seller, i.e. it is not vbalid. A Omega authorized dealer in my home-town in fact did not accepted the warranty for repair. Now the watch is in his hands to be sent to Omega. I have no idea of the problem and how expensive it will be the repair it. So the all excercise is bad and deceiving, and it would have been less expensive and more assuring to purchase the watch by an authorized dealer doing things according to the books and suggested retailer price - In fact I saved nothing and I do not have the watch!"
4,The Star is Ford,William Matteuzi has now developed into the worst leading tenor on records. He is excrable. But don't let that put you off from this set. Rossini usually provided a number of lead tenor parts. In this case we have Bruce Ford as the other lead tenor. Ford is merely sensational. No Rossinian will want to be without this recording. His entrance aria is just fab.If you have one of those new programable players maybe you can program Matteutzi right out of the opera.
4,Egypt / Lost and Found,"As in the previous Roberts books, this format of a real-life photograph side by side with the artist's rendering of the same scene gives the reader a very reflective perspective into the Ancient World."
4,honest product,"Is a decent and elegant sport watch. Its principal quality is the Luminox ilumination, that realy shines in the dark. I would be happier if it was a 100m waterproof and not 50. 50m waterfroof is critical. Remember that the test is done in perfect conditions and the watch not moving into calm water. If you fall into water suddenly the sircumstances and the presure is different. I believe all sport watches should be at least 100m waterproof. Is not realy costly to the maker and the benefit is important, but anyway this is a good watch reasonably priced. 4 stars for what it is. (compared with similarily priced products)"
5,It's a classic,"I had heard Shel Silverstein's spoken rendition of ""Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout"" before, and loved his books of poetry. The rest of the album met every expectation I had. Any fan of Silverstein will love this."
4,Not as Good as I'd Hoped,"I wish I could say this was as good as the book, but it isn't. Growing up I read the poems with my own voice and have to say I don't particularly care for Shel's overly enunciated and histrionic readings. My favorite of all time, though is Sarah Cynthia Sylvia Stout."
3,ordered the wrong product,I received the product in a very timely matter and in good condition. However my search in amazon returned audio books for my selection when I searched under books and so I ended up ordering the audio version instead of the book that I actually wanted. I've been too busy to figure out how to get in touch with the seller to return/exchange so...needless to say I'm not happy about that. But if I had meant to order this - I'd probably be very happy!
4,A wonderful memento of Munch's devotion to Honegger,"This is a reminder of how much Charles Munch loved the music of Arthur Honegger. These performances are all from concerts in the 1960s and show Honegger's development as a composer from the early Chant de Nigamon to one of his final compositions, the 5th Symphony, coincidentally premiered by Munch and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in March of 1951. Munch gives the works his usual wonderfully passionate interpretation. Recommended for all fans of both the conductor and the composer."
5,Timeless Gem,I bought this album when it was first released and I must admit it is my favorite Maureen McGovern album. Every song is a gem and sung to absolute perfection. The emotion simply pours through her voice and transports the listener into the heart of each song. She is an amazingly talented person with a wonderous instrument which is showcased one every cut. Buy this today and let yourself be swept away on an emotional journey!
3,call of the wild,"I liked this book of poems, but the ones I really liked were not that many.He does at times hit home runs with his tight,stark, self-relient silence of the great cold north. Man in the austere, unforgiving wild. Very appealing. More often he sprinkles the north woods with Greek gods, which to me, did not work so well. Sometime the words-smith work was great, more often it seemed just another poet cutting away with a traditional saw. Worth a read, then pass to a friend, who will probably regift it as well."
4,smelly jelly,"Took it to AK and caught a lot of halibut, cod and other bottom fish on jigs dipped in it"
5,luv!!!,I couldn't choose between the gold and black. I decided to order the black first to see if i really liked the shoe. I DO! I didnt notice the skull when ordering nor was it in the details. Im not a fan of the skull so i will have it replaced. However the heel is great and the leather feels wonderful.
2,Scratches easy!,"The first time I used them (using wooden spoons) the no-stick surface scratched! Also the lid handles are very hard to grip, especially when they get steamy from cooking. The lids don't completely cover the pour spout even when turned away from the pour holes. The glass inserts in the lids are useless because you can't see anything but condensation. The only good point is that they seemed to heat up well and used less heat then my cheapo pots. Also they are lovely (but not so practical)."
4,Great product.,this product is great the lids are handy when cooking food you need to drain. It is a easy clean up. great product.
4,Great deal!,I purchased this set after doing some online researching. Good Housekeeping considers this one of their favorite cookware sets. I paid $80 and I cannot tell you how happy I am with this product. I love the lids and the spouts on the pans so you can pour/drain out the water. Clean up is a breeze with the non-stick surface.
1,Horrible product!!!,I've used my Revereware for fewer than three years and already the bottom of the Dutch oven and that of the frypan have bowed. They can no longer be in safety. Prospective customers are encouraged to search elsewhere for decent-quality cookware.
2,Bottoms Separatng After 4 Years Use,"I purchased this set December 2008 - and overall had been satisfied with them, until the past few months when I noticed whenever I place a pot (or pan) on the stove, as the burner heated up - water would bubble out onto stove cook surface from between the heavy bottom of the the pot and the aluminum body of the pot. It appears the two pieces are separating. It appears some water is collecting between the two parts while being washed and then boils out as the pot (or pan) heats up. This cannot be sanitary and I am concerned my stoves cook surface may be damaged. There is a 25 year warranty on the pots and pans, so I will be contacting World Kitchen Inc. on Monday to see if they will replace them."
3,A Modestly Successful Effort,"A lot of my theological thinking may derive from the kind of tension reflected early in this book in the contrast between the views expressed in section 38 on the similarity between an ""angry holy Jehovah"" and some ""angry holy prophets"" and a more spiritual attitude in section 39 which ""came to take ecstasy for the higher goal of life and the standard by which all earthly things stand condemned."" By section 191, this book expresses sympathy for the artists who attempt to exhibit blissful exaltation in a way that is ""half priestly, half psychiatric."" If that isn't more than enough to think about, Nietzsche adds some comments on Schopenhauer in section 193, how ""his whole life long he thundered against the spectacle the Germans presented to him, but he was never able to explain it to himself."" Don't make me guess what Nietzsche was trying to explain."
5,Prolegomena To Any Future 'Gay Science': Artemis vol. 2 (Human All Too Human: Apollo vol. 1),"Daybreak being as much the culmination of Nietzsche's early philosophy as the beginning of his mature philosophy, is the marker from which he would later depart for new philosophical territories, latitudes and altitudes of thought and inquiry. The thoughts 'left on ice' will soon melt-over in a true eruption as seen in The Gay Science through Beyond Good and Evil. If Human All Too Human is the Groundwork for the Revaluation of All Values, Daybreak delineates the nihilistic abyss and chasm over which Nietzsche poses his challenge to the overman and their forefathers, the philosophers of the future. The bridge to the future begins with the Dawn, and the Great Noontide and Twilight of the Idols begin with the gloaming thought in this text: Artemis hunts at night."
4,Taking the 'Sin' Out of Cinnamon Rolls,"With three children in Iraq during the first Gulf War and weighing 300 pounds, Joanna Lund found herself thinking about death. After losing 130 pounds, Healthy Exchanges was born, and this cookbook is the latest in her series.Although a discussion about Splenda's safety would have been helpful, recipes like Decadent Fudgy Brownie Pie, Classic Cherry Cobbler, Cappuccino Cheesecake and even Choca-Cola Cake are sure to delight dieters. Not every recipe works, but many do. So can we finally take the ""sin"" out of cinnamon rolls? This book says yes - and I tend to agree."
5,One of Parker's Best,"I've read all the Parker books, even those that aren't Spenser books, and this is the best yet. Excellent, well defined characters, wonderful spare writing. You know right away who done it. The thing of it is, you don't mind knowing because it's so interesting to see how the characters handle it."
4,A Good Introduction,"It does look like this is a good time for Robert B. Parker to come up with a new character, and judging from this first book, Jesse Stone could be a winner. He's certainly different from Spenser. While he shows some wit, he's of a darker and brooding nature, having messed up his professional and personal lives by hitting the bottle too heavily. In fact, he even goes to a job interview after drinking and surprisingly gets hired as police chief in Paradise, Mass. He figures that he was hired in spite of his condition when the truth is he was hired because of his drinking...he appeared to be far easier managed than he turned out to be.Obviously, Parker intends to have the two series interrelate to a degree. Vinnie Morris and Gino Fish appear in the story, although interestingly, they never interrelate with Stone. Somehow, I suspect that might change in future novels.All in all, this is a promising beginning for a new Parker hero."
3,Very readable,"Readable is how I would phrase this book. I watched the TV movie version of this and picked up the book. It establishes the characters for the series and gets you interested in them. The plot is rather see through, not much in the way of mystery. But it has good action and it is interesting to see how Jesse thinks and works. You do get a little tired of hearing about his ex and his drinking.This author is rather simplistic and easy to read. I think this took me about two days to read in my off time."
4,At last. someone new and interesting comes along!,Jesse Stone is not a perfect person. What a relief to read about a character who isn't Pierce Brosnan beautiful and who has his own personal issues to deal with. This book is truly entertaining and wonderful to relax with after a long day at work. I will definitely look for more books in this series.
3,Fast Easy Read,"I liked the new character, Jesse Stone. As with all of Parker's novels, the dialog is the star. The story itself is a little lightweight but well plotted with a very satisfying conclusion. I'm anxious to see how or if Parker will develop this new character."
4,never thought spenser could be replaced.,"I've been a fan of Robert Parker for so many years,that I was appalled to think that Spenser had been left behind!!! Lo and behold, here comes another fascinating, vulnerable, and sensitive character and of course I'm hooked again and can't wait for the next books--and with the great,prolific Robert Parker, there will always be more to look forward to reading."
1,Spenser: In Disguise,"Who does Robert B. Parker think he's fooling? Jesse Stone, along with the 'new' female detective Sunny, and Philip Marlowe too as Parker writes him, are just re-workings of Spenser. Same personal problems, same cohorts, same basic plots. Admittedly Spenser is more worthy of repetition than some other characters, but come on! It's as if he only knows how to write one or two characters and one or two stories. I guess as long as he can sell them, he'll keep re-working the same stories. I won't buy them though."
5,Night passage,"Great book! I""'ll read the rest by this author. Enjoyed the tv series and now I can enjoy the books."
1,Ho hum,"This is the first book I've read by this author and I won't bother with another one. It certainly doesn't have the depth of a Cornwell or Patterson. Only 322 pages long with plenty of white space between the lines,etc. means you could read this entire book in a couple of hours. It wasn't particularly bad, it just wasn't good."
5,Night Passage,I love all Jesse Stone novels. I can picture Tom Selleck and all the other cast members from TV saying every word.
4,Night Passage (Jesse Stone Novel),I''ve seen the Jesse Stone movies on TV and really enjoyed them so I thought I'd try the books. I truly enjoyed the book and I could hear Tom Selleck talking all the way through. It made the characters so much more alive. The only part I didn't like was the use of the f word. Thankfully it isn't used often and hopefully the new writter will use a substitute word in the new books coming out.
4,editor,The character development and story line were easy to follow; I was able to picture the text in my mind. I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.
3,"Nice try, but the jury is still out.","After doing Spenser for so long it is time Parker tried something different even if it is in his own back yard. But he hasn't managed yet to break entirely free. In spite of everything he still has to borrow a character or two from the Spenser novels. Boo. Even so, Parker has taken the tentative first step towards creating an entirely new series. This book may not be Parker's best but it is still a good read. Try it, you may get hooked."
4,Good story,"This was different than the movie, which I saw first. I like Tom Selleck in this role so much it prompted me to buy the first book. I wasn't disappointed. Shocked at the ending. Very enjoyable read. I will probably buy the other books, too."
5,Thank You AWESOME!!!!,This book changed my whole relationship with God. It's very easy to follow and uplifting. I can see myself reading this over and again. Highly recomended for anyone who is trying to grow their faith.
5,"Shirl Kirk from Pensacola,Fl","Enjoying God was so good I couldn't put the book down. It spoke into me the relationship that we strive to have with our Father and don't really know how to acheive it. S.J. has broken this down in simple understanding that we will know how to get the relationship we want, just being quiet and listening to Him instead of a work metality or look at me attitude. Nothing we can do, say or pray can make the Father love us more. It is a must read book for anyone wanting a closer walk with God, and understanding His unconditional Love for us. Thanks to S.J.for this book."
5,"Deep in content, easy to read","S.J. Hill has written an extremely relevant book in Enjoying God. He writes as if he is sitting in your living room talking to you. Though easy to read and understand, Hill incitefully discusses the often ""hard-to-grasp"" concept of a loving, romantic God who pursues us - His bride. This book is highly recommended to all."
2,Low battery life for Canon BP-406,"What I want in a battery is at least the recommedend life in real terms, in the camera during pause,record and playback. Canon stated battery life as 45 minutes to an hour. The first time I used the battery, after charging it overnight, I was only able to get fifteen minutes recording time before It was dead. To me, this is unacceptable."
3,Quotations,"Looking for a book that has some uplifting, practical quotations that would encourage those who are grieving the loss of a spouse."
2,"WAY over rated, save your $$$","I bought this Surefire for $249 (I am embarrassed to say). I was impressed at the time, but technology has left this anemic 100 lumen light in the dust.For $22 you can buy a Nebo Redline on eBay from seller, dweil200, and this blows away the Surefire. It is a bit smaller at 4.5"" but can go from flood to spot by twisting the bezel, three outputs + SOS and strobe (features I do not appreciate on any light), and you toss one in your car or tool box it has a magnetic tail so you can attach it to a metal surface while working.For half the money of a Surfire, if you need a REALLY good light check Amazon (best prices, for expensive top-of-the-line lights) for a Fenix TK15, TK21, or TK41 (the mother of all lights, 6 AA batteries, with a quarter mile range), or the 4Sevens S12 which is also an incredible light, and substantially smaller than the TK41."
1,Poor,I did not get the product that I order on two separate occasions. I sent the product back the second time with a letter explaining the problem and I have no response.
4,Dog likes,My dog likes these treats. They work perfectly in the jar and it keeps him busy for a long time.
5,snacks for a toy,got these to fill his kon bottle toy. they go inside of it. he loves the toy and these snacks
5,Dog treats,My dog love this treat. I use this with the busk buddy linkables. My dog loves finding the treats inside this toy.
2,Buddy O's,These are ok treats. My dogs ate them but didn't seem thrilled because they were more like little pieces of dry dog food. Probably won't purchase again.
1,Premier Buddy Oh's Dog Treats,"I am sorry to say that the dog treats I received were already spoiled, when I opened the package. I just threw them out. Too mad to complain."
3,Just Dog Food?,"Dog pretty much acted like I had just given her regular dog food as a treat. Even when put in her treat ball she didn't get too excited about it. Probably just the dogs taste for treats, but she was unimpressed."
1,Defective Brakes,"We bought one of these and could not get the brakes to stop rubbing. According to my local bike shop, the problem is that the disc brake mounts are welded on to the frame in the wrong place. I intend to return the bike for a refund."
2,want a lively seder? don't use this book,"we agree with cantor epstein... this book is too scholarly, looong, and boring. we will have to potske online to find some interesting songs, stories and things to add to our seder. if you want a rabbinical thesis, this is the book for you"
4,Remixes of O'Neal's mid-80's hits,"Alexander O'Neal should've ascended to the heights of Luther, Peabo, and Freddie. Possessing a much better voice than others that ruled the charts in the 80's, O'Neal did score with some solo tracks as well as duets with Cherrelle. Their pairing is represented here with an extended version of the hit ""Never New Love Like This"".This compilation is basically an extension of ""Hearsay"", the singer's second album. The remixes, done by such stalwart mixers as Jellybean Johnson, Ben Liebrand, Keith Cohen, and Louis Silas, Jr., offer great production and slamming bass lines, reminiscent of the times.The practice of remix albums was in its infancy at the time of this album's release; this certainly stands as a worthwhile ""experiment""."

2,ho hum,"sorry, but this book just really didn't grab me. all the entries were practically the same, just with different wording and maybe a little something going on. i definently don't care for the book series as much as i liked walt disney's movie the Princess Diaries. i suppose some people may like it, but this person found it rather boring."
3,"Series Losing Steam, But Still a Great Book","The newest book in the Princess Diaries series, Princess in Waiting, is a good book to put on Meg Cabot's resume, but was not as exciting as its most recent predecessor, Princess in Love. Princess in Love was full of surprises as you turned every page, with the ending that will make Cabot even more famous, but Princess in Waiting was too predictable. I found that the only time I was nearing the edge of my seat was at the Black and White Ball, with Rene...But I won't give anything else away. Also, this book was not very exciting, though I thought when Mia was at the Moscovitz's apartment, it was SO sweet. Overall, this is a very good book that I think most readers will like, but it seemed Meg Cabot was running out of ideas for her newest book. Maybe she should have left readers hanging with the end of Princess in Love."
1,ITs Really horrible,This book was horrible. you knew what was going to happen the whole time. mia wasnt thinking that micheal would never dump her juss cause she had to cancel a date. she was juss being selfish. i am still eager to read the next one because im hoping itll be like the first through third editions of the series.Hope meg cabot made the next one better
5,If You only read one book...,"If you only read one book in your life, THIS IS THE ONE! this is my altime favorite book. Mia is so like me and i like that i can relate to her. U might think because u have al ready seen the movie u shouldn't read the book. U R WRONG! The book is totally not like the movie, it is even better! I suggest this book 4 ages 11 and up, just because 10 and lower kids might not under stand it. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Fans of the series will be happy with this one,"The fourth installment of the Princess Diaries series finds Mia spending her winter vacation in Genovia. Mia is less than pleased to be visiting the country she will someday rule because it is taking her away from her new boyfriend, Michael. When Mia finally returns to New York her relationship with Michael still doesn't run smoothly. She is constantly convinced that Michael is going to dump her and Grandmere's interference isn't helping one bit.I was kind of bored by the beginning of this book but Mia's Jane Eyre obsession and the constant digs at the Princess Diaries Disney movie made me interested again. While this isn't the best book in the series fans will not be disappointed. The series still retains everything that made it enjoyable in the first place and will leave fans waiting eagerly for the fifth book."
5,Entertainment rolls!,"She can finally be with her loved one, and is about to go out on their first date...but grrrrrr grandmere...a ball! She didn't wanted to tell Micheal that because then she thought that Micheal would be mad and break up with her before they even went out on their first date...but then, what should she do.Here we go, Princess Mia goes on obessing about rather to tell Micheal to cancel their date or just ignore it and...tell him on the last minute."
1,Awful,"I just recently picked up the series to read because I LOVE the movies. The first two were enjoyable, the third was okay, but this one is just plain TERRIBLE!! The entire length of the novel, Mia is worried about her relationship with Michael and keeping him. She thinks he is a selfish boy who will dump her for reasons such as forgetting his birthday and cancelling a date. Throw in the added bits about her being a talentless student in the Gifted and talented program and you've got a 225 page long pity party. All she does in this volume is whine about boys and trivial matters. I know she's only 14, but that is NOT what was on my mind when I was 14. I'm going to give the fifth one a shot, but Meg Cbot's wiriting needs to improve, or I might not read past it."
4,"Cornwall,NY sixth grader,","I am a Sixth grader.The book Princess Diaries 4, Princess in Waiting, by Meg Cabot is a really good book. Although I think the first Princess Diaries book is the best. This book is about the Princess of Ginovia, Mia Thermopolis. She found out a couple months ago that she was a princess. Being a princess might seem fun and easy, but it's a lot of hard work. With her grandma giving her princess lessons, school and her family it's a lot of stuff to deal with. Not to mention the little crush she has. This book is very exciting and it's not boring. It'll keep you entertained and you won't want to put it down. I guaranty that you will like this book."
4,"Not as good as the others, but still good","In the fourth volume of the ""Princess Diaries,"" Mia is on winter break in Genovia, dreaming about Michael, the boy she likes. When she gets back to Manhatten, she still wonders about Michael: Does he love her as a girlfriend, or just like her like a friend? Read it and find out! It is a good read but not as good as others in the series."
2,"meg cabot falls flat in ""waiting""","I am a loyal Meg Cabot reader, so naturally I was anxious to get my hands on this chapter of princess mia's diary, but was to say the least, disapointed. The 4th book in this seris, falls flat of all the humor and adventure in the past three. Instead you get to read 120 pages of Mia mooning over Michael, and trying to call him on a palace phone. The most adventurous this to happen in this book is when she worries that Michael has fallen in love with a surfer. Though it does have the ring of mia's writing, which is almost always a joy to read, and was the only thing to keep me from giving this book more then one star."
4,"Personally, I've Seen Better","Well, this one was a little disapointing. I don't think that it was really terrible (even if she was obsessing a LOT about Michael), but the part in Genovia was quite boring. I mean, who cares about the lack of ketchup at the dinner table? I liked the ending well enough, and things got better once Mia got to America. But really, Meg Cabot is going to have to start covering more days in her books if she wants to follow Mia through all four years of high school. At this rate, she'll need 28 books to get through!"
1,Princess in Whining,"A disgrace to the previous ""Princess"" books, this is possibly the worst of them all. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed the previous novels in this series, eager for the next. I was drinking these books up as though I'd just ran miles. But this book I almost literally snored through. Mia was turned from a funny, clumsy princess into a whining brat. All she worried about in this book was whether her dream boy was truly ""in love"" with her or not. Hey, she was his girlfriend -- what more can you ask for? In Mia Thermopolis' eyes, plenty. She just can't get enough. I thought she got over complaining about her princess lessons -- my mistake. She's also an ungrateful little snob -- her boyfriend, Michael, is so sweet and always doing such nice things for her, like coming into Algebra to say hi to her every morning even though he rode with her to school, and dedicating songs to her. And I've noticed that not once does she repay him. Mia is just a bad character to mess with!"
2,Seriously lacking,"I love The Princess Diaries, but this book was a major dissapointment to me. PD1 was fabulous, PD2 was just as fabulous, and PD3 was incredible... but PD4 was just awful. What happened? The plot was so weak, drawn out, and boring (especially during the first 70 or so pages, when Mia is in Genovia) and Mia seemed to turn into a whiny, boy crazy little twit. She was not the same Mia who I loved to read about so much.I am pleased with Meg Cabot restoring my faith in Mia in Princess in Pink though. Its not as good as the first three, but close."
3,"Good, but not the best","I really liked the three first books in this series. But when she got Micheal it's just not as fun anymore. It's just wailing through the whole book. Now, don't get me wrong, I like this book anyway, just not as much. It's a bit sad."
1,HUGE and utter disappointment.,"This book is revolting! It has neither the spunk or sparkle that was shown in Princess in Love or the original the Princess Diaries. I was quite looking forward to the fourth book, and bought it immediately when I heard that it was out, spent most of the week reading it, and became utterly disappointed in Meg Cabot. ..."
2,Disappointment,"After reading the first three books in the series, I was so excited that Meg Cabot was coming out with another Princess Diaries book! More brain candy! Well, once I got it, I was extreamly disappointed. Mia rambles on and on about how much she misses michale, and on and on about the same four topics. BORING! I couldn't finish it because the plot wasn't going anywhere, and it was mostly rambling. I wouldn't suggust this book to anyone, but I have and will continue to reccomend the other books in the series to others. Will I continue to read the series? Only if Cabot hooks the reader within the first fifty pages, which Princess in Waiting certianly did not."
3,Review on Princess in Waiting,"Princess in Waiting, is the fourth book in the Princess Diaries series. Princess in Waiting follows up on Mia, the main character, who found out she was a princess in the previous books. This book starts out in Genovia, the country that Mia is princess to. The book takes you into Mia's thoughts because it is written in diary form. Mia is just like any other teenager, except she is a princess. Mia just can't seem to figure out her new boyfriend, Michael, or why she doesn't seem to have any talents. She also has to deal with algebra, Grandmere, and more princess lessons.Princess in Waiting was a good book but I only recommend it if you have read the other three books. It is mostly just a follow up book on Mia and how she is dealing with the princess life. Mia can relate to most people, whether it is her grades, boyfriend or maybe even royalty. This is an easy read book, that shows just because you are a princess that doesn't mean all of your problems will be solved."
3,"I usually don't criticize books, but...","Mia acted like a spoiled brat in this book! She know she loves Michael, but she presents herself as if she doesn't like him so she would get more of Michael's attention. On one page she wrote that she loves Michael more than her mom! She would NEVER say that! No offense to Miss Cabot, but I think you might be running out of good ideas. So far, I still think A Princess In Love is way better. Mia really acted like she was the center of the world in this one."
2,Mia is starting to get on my nerves.,"I like the series, I really do but Mia is ridiculous and doesn't seem to be changing at all. She's a princess and yet doesn't seem to understand what that means for her and her future. She's insecure to a fault and it's the level of her insecurities that are beginning to bug me. She always needs reassurance and feels she has to exlain herself seven ways to Sunday and just doesn't seem to get it.....she's normal!!! Hello!!! I just wish her friend, Lili would slap some sense into her. All I know is, if I were a citizen of Genovia and this is what was coming to rule, I'd be afraid. Very afraid."
1,wow,"This book , much unlike the previous three in the series, was an extreme disappointment. It sounds like my friends when they are hyper-venting about their boyfriends. As if I don't already get enough of that. I sat in hours of Suspense reading ALL day because I thought that the ball would come soon enough.. but it wasn't until the end? what's up with that?I did enjoy the jokes, between lily and mia though.I like the vocabulary as wellthe only reason im even continueing reading this series is because the Princess Project Number four and a half book was soo amazingly good and funny, yet so short."
2,What Happend Meg?,"Being an avid Princess Diaries Fan, I rushed out to get this book shortly after it came out. I was sorlry dissapointed. Instead of Mia's trademark humor or sarcasm, she's become self involved and doesn't care about others.The first part of the book tells about Mia in Genovia, where she has all this stuff to do, and goes on about how all she wants is to see Micheal. (Prince Renee, Mia's cousin is one of the only ups in this book).When she gets back to New York, she decieds she doesn't want to ""chase after"" Micheal, so she basically is realyl mean to him and doesn't return his calls. Then she spends 50 pages worrying about the fact that Micheal might dump her.Yuck. Mia is self involved, worring, and a brat. Don'y let this stop you from readign the first three, but PLEASE stay away from this one."
2,"""Does Michael Love Me?"" and yada yada yada","I've read all of the PD books so far (anticipating the 6th due late March 2005), but this one was definately a dud. It's plot fell flat, consisting mostly of Mia's insecurities and constant moaning. Teenagers moan and groan and whine, YES, but this was down-right ANNOYING. She is in Genovia for the holidays and each journal entry is a count down to the last or next contact she will have with Michael. I can barely remember what happened because really, nothing seemed to happen during the course of this book. It's a blur to me, and I'm not willing to try to remember."
2,how fast can I pitch this into the trash?,"Like practically everyone on this, I loved the first three books in this series. But come on, an entire book based on the fact that Michael might dump her because of one date (when he obviously isn't)? It's not enough to carry a book. I'm really disappointed in Meg Cabot's writing, especially in the fifth book."
4,Princess Diaries 4,"The Princess Diaries series are some of my favorite books, and as much i like the books, i didn't like Princess in Waiting as much as the other 3. I guess all the parts where she was in Genovia made it sort of boring because it didn't have as much voice as when she's home. The first part is sorta boring but it gets better after a while. Hang in There."
3,To much Genovia,"Lets just say the others where alot better, about half the book is filled with schedules that sayBreakfeastPress ConferenceMeeting with Prime MinisterLunch with sos and soMeeting with governessWaste water treatment planDinner with ContessaTea with emperorBEdI would definetly recomend the other 3! But meg Cabot still has it in her, Doesnt there always have to be a low point in the series?????"
4,This book was good,I am a huge fan of the princess diary series. I read the first book two days after it was released and then was hooked. This book brings Micheal and Mia together but apart for a portion of the book. Grandmere of course has to stick her nose in Mia's business. And just when we think the princess lessons are over Mia messes up and grandmere enforces them longer. I recommend reading ALL the books first.
1,"Poor Cooler, Not For Use On A Powerful GPU","I bought this cooler among several others, and I found it to be the worst of 5 different coolers in my performance testing. I found that this product resulted in a thermal resistance of approximately 1 Kelvin/Watt. Typical values for coolers in the same price range are .4 to .6 K/w, depending on the technology used. Despite the product description, this will not effectively cool your components. There are better budget VGA coolers out there, and if you are looking to overclock, don't even think about buying this product."
5,Excellent Product,This product was high quality and works great... It did require slight modification (I bent the tabs a bit) to get it to mate with my board... I am very pleased...
5,A good value and a good fan,"The only complaint I have is that the fan was a little noisy the first time it started up. That may just be that it needed to shake out the cobwebs. Since then, it's performed fine, and very quiet. It was easy to install and the kit came with everything you might need--fan, two heat sinks, adhesive tape, pins, and thermal goo.Still, the noise thing makes me a little nervous."
4,Nice chipset cooler,"Work nice in my Asus A8N-SLI, but, a little great and hits the Fan chipset power conector... there is no problem if make a small modification...------------------Trabaja muy bien en mi Asus A8N-SLI, pero, es un poco grande y choca con el alimentador del ventilador chipset... no hay ningun problema si le haces una pequeña modificacion...Thx Amazon !!!"
5,Just what I hoped for.,"The cruddy plastic fan on my PNY NVIDIA GeForce 9400GT died. That caused the chip to overheat and shut down. (no video)After a bit of research I got the Vantec Iceberq. Excellent, couldn't be better. Although there were absolutely no instructions except one drawing on the box, the install was easy. The heatsink/fan combo clipped right over the chip and was held down by the two spring pins. Good solid contact with the chip face. The included power adapter meant no hacking or messing with mismatched pins for the fan.Runs basically silent. Can't hear it over the system's regular fans. No chip overheats since I did it. A million times better than the original POS included with the card.Highly recommended."
5,My experiences with this fan.,"This fan was quicly shipped to me. If it wasn't the same model of fan that I replaced, then it was too close to my old fan to tell the difference."
2,Disappointment that the illustrations are black & white.,"It should be noted, and future buyers beware, the photographs of the illustrations and paintings are in BLACK & WHITE. Why on earth anyone would reproduce these marvelous pieces without their original color is beyond me. It's as bad as only printing the left half of the illustration or the right half but not showing it in it's entirety."
1,Worthless for Biblical scholarship,"This volume picks a *few* passages from Isaiah to ""translate,"" supposedly from the Hebrew text, but the end product has little to do with the text or anything relevant to Biblical scholarship. It appears to integrate the author's subjective impressions with whatever contemporary application he happened to have at the moment. Isaiah 53, for example, is said to speak of a subject who is compared to an unnoticed, ordinary tree in a forest, to a piece of junk in a junk heap in a bad section of a city (or something to that effect), etc.Perhaps this book is of value for other purposes; I cannot think of what they might be."
5,exactly as expected,"Was exactly what i expected and needed for my pistols. If you have never used jags before give these a try, they work a lot better than the plastic ones. Just make sure you have a strong rod as when ya put the pressure on it the rod will be your weakest link."
5,Quality brass jags at an affordable price,"They work as advertised and come in a handy plastic storage container for organized storage. One of the best ways if not the best way, to get a truly clean barrel. Buy em if you need a set and you won't be disappointed."
4,Great jag set at a very reasonable price.,"Excellent Tipton quality jag set.Brass so you won't have to worry about your barrel if the jag wears through the patch (or catches a corner)Sizes are just right but you have to make sure the patch isn't too large (I find round patches work just the same as the square, as long as you don't have them too big)I think the thread size must be standard for all but the .17 which is the finer thread size.If you catch this set on sale (under thirteen for me) you're getting a great deal."
4,Gun Cleaning,"The product was in new codition, came on time and recieved at a good price. They work well a were a good fit for the bore of the rifle."
4,Very nicely made,"Well machined set, definitely not flimsy. Points are sharp. Does a decent job of hanging on to the patch but if you go a wee bit too far through the barrel, the return trip will be sans patch. MUCH better than the plastic variety that seem prone to break"
1,Sized wrong for cotton patches,These jags easily punch a hole in a patch. The jag and the patch will stick in the bore if you use cotton patches (t-shirt material). I have owned a set for a few years and gave up on it a while back.
3,"Well, at least it looks good","Unfortunately this bracelet did nothing but it does look great. It also make a nice conversation piece, lots of people ask me about it."
4,Sad and honest.,"This book was so honestly written, the mother writing so truthfully about her love, fear, and worry for her daughter, only to end tragically. I feel so much for her and her family. Every mother should read this."
3,Sad reading,This book is very sad.The way the girl really had no one who understood her exept Sid Vicious is sad.He could not help her.I have a friend in school like this and she is doing well.She has a good foster home with parents who take an interest in her and keep her on her medicine.This book can't help anyone with a family member whose disturbed.I cant recomend it for anybody as a help book because they never figured out whats wrong with Nancy and it's just real painful to read.
3,Sad,"The sad part is, if Nancy had been on the proper medication, lithium or whatever it may have been, she most likely would not have become a junkie. And maybe, just maybe, she would have been in her right mind and able to avoid the situation which led to her death. Did Sid do it? I don't know. If you are a heroin addict and hang in those circles, you are putting yourself in a very dangerous place. With violent people. I liked the book, it is a mothers story of her child who had a serious mental disorder, and grows up with the same problems, only worse. Trying to self medicate with dangerous drugs. Read the book, I think you will find it interesting, and It may touch your heart."
2,How much truth?,"This made a very interesting read. My main problem with it was the many inaccuracies relating to the Pistols, the music industry and England in 1977. If someone cannot be bothered to research correctly they shouldn't attempt to write a book. If she can't get simple things like John Lydons name correct then what other mistakes has her memory made?I have read a review from a friend of Nancy's implying that this book was written to resolve the Mother of any blame and was rather guilt ridden. I did not know Nancy but was around the punk scene at the time and I am afraid I would have to agree. A great story but a poor writer and a poor Mother."
1,A mother absolves herself of all responsibility,"""And I Don't Want to Live This Life"" is basically one mother's attempt to absolve herself of all responsibility for the tragic life of her daughter. I was appalled by the lengths to which Mrs. Spungen has gone to make sure that her readers understand that despite all of her best efforts to help and rehabilitate her daughter: there was nothing she could do, her daughter was a bad seed. There are no bad seeds, only bad mothers."
5,Loved It!!! :-),I read this book years ago but it is one that kind of stays with you. You can feel Deborah's pain it was very well written!!! Loved it!!!
5,you will read this book again & again!,"i bought this book for the first time several years ago, i can't even tell you how many times i've read it from cover to cover in a days time, it is impossible to put down,Mrs. Spugen's account of her daughters life is so real, so raw and so tragic, it paint's a completely different picture of the ""druggie slut"" the media so viciously portrayed Nancy as, it is a story of a families struggle to save thier child and stay together, a love story, most people would never have know the depth of love Sid & Nancy had for each other,this is a must read, for any Pistols fan and any mother who ever felt the pain of losing thier child."
5,Tragic and Beautiful at the Same Time,"The first time I read this book I was in tears for about fifteen minutes straight! Deborah's painful and achingly beautiful book kept me into it for hours and hours. I only read this book in two days, not because I was bored, because I couldn't stop reading it! This is my favorite book of all time. No author could ever replace this beautiful piece of literature..."
3,I don't like the way the mother treated Nancy,"I understand the problems Nancy had but I CANNOT understand Debbie letting everything Nancy did just go, like making Susie give up her rights to keep the peace. I was so sick of reading yes, I love you Nancy, go about your way and I'll check up on you when I can. Oh, I'm In N.Y. I'll bring some food, go to your methadone center, buy you lunch and see ya. Then complain. The dad too, seeing Nancy and Sid like that to drop off their things and leaving. I don't see how she was loved except to let her do anything she wanted and as they say, walking on eggshells! Give me a break! Their love was all talk. Basically, it was all about poor Debbies suffering, makes me want to barf. I donot feel sorry for Debbie, but for Nancy, who had to put up with YOU!"
3,what I thought about the book,"I thought that the book was overall a good book, although I felt like the language could have not gone to such extremes. I understand that is what type of personality Nancy and Sid had, but enough was really enough. I felt that Nancy's troubled like was drug out ... it took forever to get to the point of her problem."
1,Not As Good As Jonny Lydon's Book,"I loved the book by johnny Lydon [Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs]I bought this book after reading Johnny Lydon's book but this one was a let down.Sid Vicious was a hot looking punk star and lots of girls (me to) still love him.I read a little of this book but it's mostly lady who gets pregnant and she complains and my kid drives me nuts and i wish i had a abortion, blah blah my kid's going to the funny farm,lol,if it wasn't so full of ""I this"" and ""I that""and 'I wanted to go to college, but she was in my way"" it could've maybe been a little interesting.Whining and complaining just turned me off and I doubt I'll ever finish it. It's like ""Diary of a whiny housewife"".If anybody knows where I can geta copy of Ann Beverly's Family Album please help."
4,And I don't want to live this Life...,I love this book. I had a copy several years ago but lost it in a move. I was in college during the time period of Nancy Spungeon's death & remember wondering what happened to her. Mrs. Spungeon was honest with what life had been like with & for Nancy. I applaud her courage to write about her family's life & their pain.
4,"Where was the ""sweet baby"" she kept talking about?","This truly was a wonderful book. It was totally insightful, and I really felt for the Spungen family. Lord knows I wouldn't have been able to deal with everything they went through. However, it really, REALLY frustrated me towards the end of the book after Nancy was so far gone, and when she died, that Mrs. Spungen kept referring back to this ""sweet baby girl"" of hers. ""Where had the sweet little girl I had given birth to gone?"" Where had she gone?! She never existed to begin with! From the get go, she tells us a story of a newborn who never stopped crying. A 2 yr old who threatened to ""cut up all her clothes"" She tells of a child who threatened to stab the babysitter, who jumped out onto a roof, and who enjoyed drugs and easy sex. Overall, a great book. But the repetitive talk of a daughter who never existed got to me after a while."
4,Superb book - don't judge Sid & Nancy until you read it!,"I'm surprised to see so many recent reviews of this book - I first read it about 10 years ago and loaned it to a friend. She never returned it and I have never been able to replace it as it is extremely difficult to find. Some people in the reviews below are saying Nancy's condition was a result of her mother's treatment. I believe, having read this book so many times, something must be done to change these views - doctors can't go on for ever saying a child is normal when it obviously isn't. Deborah has highlighted in a very moving and emotional book the plight of many families trying to cope with their ""normal"" children. Sid & Nancy were both very misunderstood individuals who found solace with each other and one understood the other. Read this book, please - and keep a box of tissues nearby as I guarantee you will be crying from about halfway through right to the end."
4,True story of mental ilness,"This book about a very disturbed girl and the pressure and toils on her family is very interesting.It is also extremly sad because there is no cure for the girl and as the tittle lets you know,she eventually dies.Murdered by an equaly disturbed boyfriend and member of the Sex Pistols.I recomend this book especially for schizophrenec awareness."
4,A lucid and sensitive travel narrative of the first quality,"Higgs, a numismatist with a special interest in the medieval Levant, gets a tip about an undervalued amateur collection to be auctioned at an estate sale in the popular English resort town of Blackpool. What he finds is a collection of faked Roman scrap, but by then it's too late, he's already fallen in love with (and on) the famous Trams of Blackpool. What follows is a delightfully (some might call it overly) detailed account of the sights, sounds, and smells one will encounter along each of the routes; what makes the book really special (aside from Higgs' signature musclebound, tight-trousered prose) is the appendix, in which a history of the mechanical evolution of the town's tram corps is transformed into what amounts to a history of the evolution of our own human (oh, all too) souls. Worth every cent of the out-of-print search fee."
3,sterling silver earrings,"I got the earrings on time, and I absolutely loved them for about two weeks until they started to look rusty.( I did not shower while wearing them or leave them sitting on the bathroom sink.)"
2,Blech!!,This is not one of Grisham's best. The story was long in the tooth and did not really go anywhere. I found it hard to stay focused on the plot and could not relate to any of the major characters. In short...P. U.!
2,"B-O-R-I-N-G; trust me; pretentious, surreal garbage drama","The book starts out quick, right? Yeah, and it runs along kind of quickly except some of it starts sounding like switching back and forth from a documentary on the Tobacco Industry to a pretentious, incredulous thriller. The way Nicholas Easter controls the jurors is like a ""scenes we'd like to see"" scenario from Mad magazine. The book is also very predictable from the beginning, and the only thing that holds you through to the end is the anticipation of Fitch's reaction, which is not worth unveiling. Not worth the time or the money!!!"
2,"Good start, poor finish.","He needs to go back and start practicing law rather thanwriting about it, maybe that will get him some experience and bringsome life into his stories. ""A Time to Kill"" was his best and written from the heart, ""The Firm"" was a real thriller (the movie wasn't), since these two books he's become redundent with his plots. His endings can be anticipated. It's difficult to believe that all Fortune 500 companies are out to ""pray on the little man."" He needs to get back to his ""roots"" and quit trying to entertain Hollywood."
5,Grisham is a MasterCraftsman of Legal Plots,"Grisham Does a good job of exposing the Tobacco Industry. The ending is however a little abrupt !! Seemed like he wanted to end the book in 401 pages!!!Venki Uddameri,Orono, Main"
5,You learn the facts about tobacco.,"Ethics isn't in the vocabulary of the lawyers involved in the biggest civil case ever in a little court house in Mississippi. The reader will be horrified at the facts of tobacco smoke and tobacco-related death; mystified by the extent to which lawyers will tamper with the jury system; laugh at the mishaps on the jury. This book is entertaining and informative, and you will be amazed at the lengths lawyers on both sides go to to ensure they get their verdict. Grisham proves the Jury system is like a football game, and the jury is often the football"
3,How serious the tobacco suit is!,"I did not enjoy a first half of this book. Some sections seemedto be boring.^MJust after finishing this book ,I heard the news thatTobacco companies have negotiation with plaintiff lawyers for $300 Billion smoking illness compensation deal, in reality. ^MI could have enjoyed it much more if I had known this kind of background in US."
3,Why not?,"This is what makes Grisham so satisfying to read: the bigemotional payoff for the clever protagonist. The immenselycomplicated plots are a way of rewarding the smart ones, and modern American society doesn't offer too many rewards for brains. So it wasn't surprising--still, there's a little kick to my ego whenever I figure out where Grisham's going. It's a fun read and sure to spark many conversations on the potential rewards of jury duty."
3,Runaway jury - do you really want to run?,Once again another stamped out legal novel from anerica's best known ex-lawyer.The story line is as predictable as his other novels but is nonetheless entertaining in getting you there.Only the most nieve would not know where this particular book is going.Once again there is a serious lack of human interest in this legal tale. No wonder Hollywood is never ableto make a decent film from these written words. A bit of wham bam thank you mam would have done wonders?
1,John Grisham's worst book yet,"I have read all of John Grisham's books and The Runaway Jury is the worst which I have read. This book is too verbose, it dwells too long in unimportant issues and there are little suspense. The ending is 'unbelieveable', just to say the least"
1,Oy Vey!,"I've only read The Firm and loved it. While reading The Runaway Jury, I kept waiting for the story to ""pick up,"" but for me, it didn't. I refused to not finish the book, though during my reading, I felt like a masochist. I forced myself to read this book, finally finished it, and didn't like it at all. This book had to be as boring as my own real life jury duty experience. Good thing I didn't bring this book with me..."
1,"No likeable characters; ""twist"" ending visible from halfway","The best thing about this book: pages and pages of legal issues at the heart of tobacco litigation. But -- I got an even clearer picture in a 3 page article in Barron's.The worst thing: the protagonists aren't likeable, and don't struggle. In fact, they endure not a single set-back through the course of the book. After I saw the double-cross coming, I stuck around with perverse (and not very high) hopes of seeing them get shot in the head in the final pages"
4,One of John's best.,"I listened to this story while on a long drive down the Baja. It packed lots of twists and turns just like the road I was driving on, and I found it very absorbing. It lived up to my expectations for a clever plot and interesting court drama."
3,John's Jury: Me,"Grisham is disappointing me. He has gotten away from his years of breath taking pace and intrigue, and is now starting to fill his pages with gore galore. I'll leave him for someone else to read."
3,"Book-Too Slow, Movie-Great","This is the second book I read from this author (Summons was my first). It took too much to hook me up, because of all the descriptions... But in the other hand, the movie was great!!!! I'm now starting The King of Torts and can not wait to finish it."
4,Better Than I Thought,"Many of the reviews I had read for this book had not been positive. So, I approached it with some hesitation. But, in truth, I found the book to be one of Grisham's better works. The characters are a bit cardboard-like, but the action is fast, the plot takes several twists and the prose is well written. The ending may be reminiscent of ""The Firm"", but it is still a good read."
3,For School,"""The Runaway Jury"", by John Grisham is about a Tobacco lawsuit, in which a widow sues a tobacco company for the death of her husband. It takes you threw the steps of jury selection and deals with the tactics both sides use to try to turn the odds of the trial to there side. The story mainly deals with the tactics used by the defense to turn the trial in there favor. The main Character for the defense side is a man named Rankin Fitch. He calls all the behind the scenes shots.The Jury however has a surprise of its own, a man named Nicholas Easter and his partner a mysterious girl named Marlee. She and Nicholas throw the Defense and the jury both threw a few loops. This story keeps people guessing up to the end."
4,"Very, Very Good","The Runaway Jury was a great book. The plot was great and the debate on tobacoo was interesting and brought up some good points. It lost a star because 1)It got slow in a few places 2) The ending was a little unrealistic. I also recommed The Rainmaker, with is even better."
5,Unique insights,An amazing amount of detail and the perfect amount of suspense blended for the reader in a potent combination
5,GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!,"Runaway Jury was one Grisham's best! The storyline was great and twisted. I love the way Grisham worked the characters into the jury. A must read! ****** I ordered another novel called, THE FIST OF GOD by A.T. Nicholas from Amazon which was phenomenal. It was a great supernatural thriller. I recommend both books."
3,The end is a let down,"I have been a loyal Grisham fan ever since I read A Time To Kill. And, Grisham's The Runaway Jury held me right until almost the very end. And then I experienced the biggest let down I've ever had in a Grisham book. I felt disorientated and dissappointed. I don't always want some sappy, kissy, happy ending, but I expect at least some consistency from beginning to end. I felt no sympathy for any of the characters, and if this was the desired effect than it worked like a charm. The only thing that compares to this let down is when someone told me the ending of The Chamber before I was three chapters in. I have decided to read The Partner; but if this one is as big of a let down, I'm done with Grisham."
2,Not up to par,"I was definitely disappointed with this one! It had a very slowbeginning and it was difficult to stay interested. But as I read on,it did get interesting and even a little intriguing around the middle. However, it was very predictable. I could figure out the ending from the beginning!I think Grisham needs to work on his endings because once again, I'm disappointed. The Runaway Jury can't compare to The Client or even A Time to Kill."
3,good but not good enough,"A story of the illegal company with the one million dollar in the court case. Sound interesting? But I can tell, the whole of the story is more than that.The Runaway Jury is entertaining book if you have time to understand the point of its story. Moreover, this story have lots of characters which are hard to understand all of their thought. Because of this, the reader can't become to be the part of the story. However, The Runaway Jury gives the knowledge about the trial process to reader which is very interesting.By the way, I don't recommend this book if you don't like a story which involves a complex trial."
2,Too Much Litigation,"I'll bet that half of this book was courtroom litigation, and this was not interesting to me. I enjoyed the jury scheming and the personalities on the jury, but I didn't read the testimony and began to skip over ALL of it once I realized just how tedious it was going to be. Why did I do that?!? Because everyone knows that nicotine is addictive and that it kills. Did we need more than 150 pages to tell us that?? In fact, I got the gist of the ending, without spending all that time in the actual courtroom.. So, was it all necessary to the book? I don't think so.I'm not saying for some that this book would not be an interest, but I'm more attracted to human relationships and not all these lawyers and repetitious testimony.. Jeez, turn on FOX or MSNBC right now and you'll get more real-life litigation than you'll ever need to see!"
2,A big disappointment,"In reading the previous reviews raving about how good this was, it's hard to believe we're talking about the same book. I have read all of Grisham's and feel the plot here was was trite, banal and predictable. Where was the page-turner impetus? I, too, feel he just pushed this one out too fast and only hope he will do better. We know he's an excellent and gifted writer"
5,This book is adictive! nearly as much as tobacco is.,I rate it with 5 stars because it kept me reading and reading and reading without geting a minute of bordom out of it's pages .But I must say that the author could had put litle more of a reality ending to the book.Never the less a great book to read .
2,At least it was somewhat entertaining,"I have yet to figure out why I keep reading Grisham's books. I never liked ""The Firm"", and friends kept recommending other Grisham books as the best one he's written (""The Pelican Brief, ""A Time to Kill"", ""The Rainmaker"" etc.) As a result I've read all but the latest 2, but I am sure they are just like the rest; tedious, predictable, implausible, and if any of these students or lawyers were real they would have all been kept from joining the bar or if already practicing, disbarred. Somehow these books manage to further the image of the lawyer as a bottom feeder, even when they seem to be saving us from a worse fate (tobacco companies, insurance companies or assasination attempts on justices). At least this one was entertaining. It didn't make a crucial Grisham mistake, it didn't seem to take itself too seriously."
5,The best ever!!,"This is the 2nd book of Grisham's that I read. Totally surprise because it's really different from The Rainmaker, which is really slow and boring, though I read it till the end.The Runaway Jury's plot really unexpected and have the kind of making your heart stop!! really good book, and I expect the same in your next book Grisham!! Best of luck.. :)"
4,Very enjoyable book!,"The runaway jury is an excellent book to read. The story is interesting and something new happens in every chapter. The story also builds mystery and suspense about the characters. The only problem is found with this book is that there are too many characters to follow, grisham should have supplied a pen and paper to take notes while you read."
2,CAN'T SEEM TO GET STARTED,"I PUT THIS BOOK DOWN AND I CAN'T PICK IT BACK UP. UNLIKE THE FIRM,PELICAN BRIEF, THE CLIENT THIS BOOK DID NOTHING FOR ME EXCEPT RUIN THE LAST TWO DAYS OF MY VACATION. THE TWO STARS ARE FOR JOHN GRISHAM HIMSELF....GOOD EFFORT AT LEAST. BRING IN ANOTHER FIRM"
3,"An enjoyable book, although not his best work.","This book is definetely not one of Grisham's better works. It is still enjoyable, but not up to par with his other books.I found the plot to be a bit thin, and the telling of the tale simply skipped over too many facts to remain believeable.For your money you'd be better off buying one of his other books."
1,"Oh, you must read this book!...NOT!","When my dad passed away due to lung cancer, three separate people attending his funeral said to me, ""you haven't read The Runaway Jury? Oh, you must. You just MUST read this book. "" So I did. Biggest waste of time ever! Boring boring boring. And his other books are not that hot, either. I don't care for John Grisham at all."
3,The Runaway Jury,"The name of my book is The Runaway Jury by John Grisham. This book is nonfiction and was written in memory of Tim Hargrove (1953-1995). The theme of this book is the precedentsetting lawsuit against a giant tobacco company. This book is really interesting yet it did have its low points. Most of the time, the book was boring, but when it wasnt boring, it was very entertaining. I recomend this book to everyone that enjoys the wonder of what will happen next. The book could have been deeper in meaning when it came down to the court cases. The begining of the book was exciting because anything could have happend. When you get into the book you begin to wonder if the two main jurors have good or bad intentions. When their pasts are uncovered you begin to think twice about them. Now everything depends on their verdict. Overall i enjoyed this book! It made me not want to stop reading and i think it will be the same for you!"
2,Predictable,Anyone can figure out what's going to happen in this book before they are half way through it. John Grisham is cranking his latest books out too quickly
2,"""The Firm"" revisited","John Grisham has written a couple of very good books, but with his latest bombs such as ""The Chamber"" and ""The Rainmaker"", it appears that he returned to a plot that worked well for him. Unfortunately he did a very poor job of hiding his re-use of this plot.I am sure, he would have sued anyone else who wrote this book for plagerism.Also, as an attorney, Grisham knows that all these shannigans that were pulled by his characters would have been caught and stopped. Come on John, if you have lost touch with the reality of practicing law, go hang around the courthouse in Oxford and get some real stories. You are wasting your writing talents on improbable and unrealistic material when there is a lot of good stuff out there."
2,Slow and predictable,"This was my first Grisham book the others must be better. This book was based on a very timely issue (tabacco companies and jury problems)and I found some of the early parts of the book interesting, but then it went on and on and on and with the exception of one minor twist at the end it was obvious where it was going"
2,Not one of John Grisham's better books.,"I thought the character development was poor to nonexistent. They were stick figures inserted into a diatribe against the legal system. His characters in previous books (especially Time to Kill and Rainmaker) were much better developed, believable, and likeable"
1,Losing His Touch,I struggled to finish this book. Mr. Grisham is losing his touch and boring us to death.
3,"Enjoyable, but not very believable","""The Runaway Jury"" is a classic Grisham yarn. The plot romps along quickly and the courtroom drama is heaps of fun. It's hard not to get swept up in Grisham's high-stakes tobacco litigation, as cigarette manufacturer Pynex and its team of legal eagles spare no expense to defend themselves in a product liability lawsuit. The legal maneuvering and double-crossing tactics between Big Tobacco and the anti-tobacco operatives should keep your attention for the full 550 pages. But the implausibility of the plot and the mind-numbing shallowness of some of the characters will probably make you roll your eyes in frustration more than a few times. It's a harmless little book. But sticklers for plausibility may want to keep their distance."
5,I LOVED IT!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book is Da Bomb for 3 reasons:1.It moves at a speed of light pace and is an enjoyable read. 2.The main characters are really cool. I like how Grisham fleshes out the lives of the individual characters. 3.Rankin Fitch, Grisham's best villian.Need I say more? All in all, Grisham's best novel."
4,Grisham's familiar formula hits another home run.,"John Grisham has found a good formula, and it serves him well once again in this novel.The wronged protagonist takes up against the monolithic system, and wins against all odds.This book is a little predictable at times, but you still race through the pages: just because you know where you're going doesn't mean the ride isn't fun!"
5,Best Book to date by Grisham,Grisham has matured and his subject matter is very timely.Hard to put down. Unusual twist at end.
3,A Good Read,"This book has an all right plot line, but lacks ingenuity. Unlike many of Grisham's other books, I could tell what the ending would be when only two-thirds through. I also believe that (because of the setting) this book contains too many characters. Grisham reverts to using too many stereotypes in describing them. Just to mention some of the characters, there were: twelve jurors, a Judge, a courtroom staff, defense and plaintiff lawyers, and everyone's family/ love interests. I just couldn't keep them all straight. Besides those three points, I found the story very fun and a pretty easy read."
3,It Goes Where All Grisham Has Gone Before,"This is a good book. Fine plot. Great pacing, and wonderful, creepy, secretive characters.In fact, it's almost exactly like all other Grisham courtroom dramas. Oh, the focus is different, and the particulars have changed, but in essence, the same tale retold... few people fighing for what's right (if not necessarily legal) in the face of bureaucratic mercenaries.If you like The Firm, The Rainmaker, The Pelican Brief, The Partner, The Client, and most other Grisham standbys (notable exceptions to this stellar but repetitive list would include A Painted House and The Street Lawyer, both of which I found refreshing fare from Grisham), you will like The Runaway Jury. It might not surprise you. It might not challenge you. But it should amuse you, and maybe that's all it has to do."
4,Wrong choice for a second Grisham read,"After finally reading Grisham's ""A Time To Kill"" which I thoroughly enjoyed and couldn't put down, I chose this, ""The Runaway Jury"" as my second Grisham novel. While it is a decent book, it is a tad on the boring side. Some of the characters' names are weird and awkward to pronounce (""Durr"" Cable and Nicholas Easter). This adds a certain degree of difficulty to getting through the book in less than 7 or 8 days and the characters are about as dull as their names. The story of the ""biggest"" tobacco trial in history lacks the drama that would be implied, is a bit far-fetched and is sort of anti-climactic. I didn't find myself really caring one way or the other about which side would come out victorious.Luckily, this book is still good enough that it hasn't turned me off of continuing my self-introduction to Grisham. Perhaps ""A Time To Kill"" was a bit easier and more enjoyable having been familiar with the movie. I give ""Runaway Jury"" 4 stars."
5,Grisham's Best Work,"Ever hear all those rumors or inneundos about how the tabacco industry fights lawsuits with sleazy tactics and jury manipulation? Or about jury consultants, and how trial lawyers use them to try to deliver a verdict favorable to the client? Or how about the huge sums juries award to people who have been hurt by products? Grisham has, and he put it all down in writing in The Runaway Jury.What makes the story work is that somebody else knows all about jury manipulation, and if big tabacco are masters at working it from the outside, somebody else has figured out how to work it from the inside. And that one juror is working it masterfully..."
3,Disappointing,"I have loved all of John Grisham's books, but this one could have done without so much foul language and sexual references. I realize that this may be the 'real world' but some of us read good literature/books to escape the 'real world.' I am disappointed when a writer of Grisham's caliber stoops to the level of lesser men.. The story was great, as usual."
4,Good leisure reading,"The Runaway Jury is not the best of Grisham's books (which might be A Time to Kill, The Client and The Rainmaker), but it is still very good and much better than The Street Lawyer! After reading some of Grisham's books, the plot becomes a bit predictable, which makes reading them not so exciting, but on the other hand, great for leisure, since you don't have to concentrate that much to follow the story. It was a great book to read in the beach during the summer, stoping to talk to people all the time."
3,You won't Runaway from This Book,"Grisham does a credible job of somehow blending fast-paced action within the mundane process of a jury trial. This jury is filled with a colorful cast of characters, each with something to hide. Juror #2 has the most devious hidden agenda, as he joins forces with a mysterious woman on the outside and tries to take control of the jury, as they sort through a multi-million dollar lawsuit against a tobacco company. Not Grisham's best, but not his worst. An informative and entertaining read."
4,Grabs you from the very start,"The jury of a big tobacco civil trial is being manipulated from all sides. The defense has hired Rankin Fitch, an expert at fixing juries. He and his minions know everything there is to know about the jurors especially their weaknesses. There is one juror, Nicholas Easter, however, that is a mystery to them. His background is sketchy and they can't pinpoint how to approach him. Then Fitch starts getting cryptic phone calls from a young woman and discovers Easter is quietly controlling the jury from the inside. Fitch knows the endgame will be a large amount of money for the verdict he wants, but the question is, how much?Grisham does a masterful job at weaving this story and controlling the many characters without confusing the reader. The pace is fast and it keeps you wondering what exactly do Easter and the woman want? The only complaint I have is a few too many subplots that took away from the focus of the story. Overall, a great read."
4,Great Reads,"Once again John Grisham has proved what a master storyteller he is, and as always he knows his subject. If you enjoy Grisham's writing, try reading a new author on the scene, Glynnis Hayward. Her first novel, A TELLING TIME, shows Grisham-like suspense as a gripping court case evolves with accompanying intrigue."
2,Boring,"Let me save you some time. If you are not a Grisham fan, skip this book. This story of jury manipulation is not only not plausible, but also boring.I cannot figure out why all these people keep giving Grisham great reviews."
2,Yuck!,"Grisham has created a novel full of cynicism and his usual dose of unsavory lawyers. But not one of his main characters has any sympathetic qualities or any humor. So the net effect of the book is that I cared about no one, not even the ""good guys""."
1,The Runaway Brain,"(Note: This review refers to the audio version) This is a pretty silly story that becomes increasingly unconvincing as it goes along. Although one doesn't turn to Grisham for hard-nosed realism, this tale was especially far-fetched and seemed like something he dreamed up while sitting on the can at his publisher's office. As unfortunate as the story is, it's made worse by Michael Beck's reading. His version of a Southern accent sounds at times like a bad impersonation of an English butler. For a far better and more compelling listen involving lawsuits against sinister corporations, check out the audio of Jonathan Harr's ""A Civil Action"". It's gripping...and true."
1,Not worth buying,John Grisham has lost his creativity. Now he is just churning out books that seem too similar to what he has already written
4,A Jury Duty Find!,"I love John Grisham novels and this one is no doubt a keeper. I had jury duty coming up and figured what more of an appropriate read than a John Grisham novel? The characters are well-developed and have fantastic personalities, and the plot keeps you on your toes. I was hooked as I started the book, and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants a good court read that they will not want to put down that will pass the time."
3,"A light, compelling read...",This book didn't lack punch and was an incredibly easy read. I highly recommend it for travelling and other light reading.
2,The Tarantino of literature,"Grisham delivers, once again, another courtroom drama, but this time there are no hero lawyers outsmarting the odds and getting ungodly amounts of money. It's just the jury, with all those lovely lawyer/judge spats cut out.The absense of the ""genius boy"" lawyer in this novel makes it rather refreshing. The main characters are a woman trying to get ungodly amounts of money and a jury-rigging bad guy. It's no wonder that there has been such opposition to the context of the story when Grisham's signature character isn't there.Grisham's work is incredibly similar to Tarantino movies. He usually jumps around and tries to confuse you just to make the ending better and more shocking. This novel's plot is a little thin though. It's not nearly as deliberate and calculating as his former works, which makes it seem too unnessarily jumpy and belittles the new attempts at characters. For what it's worth, it's interesting, but much more predictable than his previous works."
2,BORING!!!!,"The reason I read this book was because of the name ""Grisham"", and slowly I started to lose interest as the plot began to develop.THE RUNAWAY JURY is nothing compared to THE FIRM or THE RAINMAKER.All I can say is : This is Grisham's worst book. Boring plot. Unconvincing characters. Unrealistic story and more"
5,A Grisham Classic,"This is the type of book that true Grisham fans crave, the type that he built his reputation and career on.In the story of a tobacco litigation suit, Grisham unviels a disturbing conspiracy. The conclusion is riveting and powerful, nothing less than we would expect from the author. If you're looking to get into the world of Grisham, The Runaway Jury is an excellent place to begin."
3,Predictable...almost!,"Not his best, that was A Time To Kill. The protagonists were completely unlikeable albeit clever. The shenanigans pulled off by Nicholas and Marlee are most improbable but fascinating. The sleeze-bag legal community pretty true to form as I discovered after a few years with a firm. This book much better than Rainmaker and Pelican Brief. Grisham is really stretching for shocker plots"
1,Could some of the five star reviews be from Grisham himself?,I tried reading this book last Summer. It's one of the few books I started but never finished. I agree with most of the one and two star reviews. This book's defining characteristic is IMPLAUSABLE. A book about an expedition to the moon in search of green cheese would have been as believeable. Throw in a heroin trying to stop them because green cheese is fattening and addictive -- Wow! What could be better? Not this Grisham novel.
1,It S-U-C-K-S !!!,"A thorough disppointment! This is my first John Grisham Book, and I utterly hated it . So many people have been buying this book in the bookstore that I frequented, I was led to believe that it must be ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! What a complete waste of money and my time !!For all of you who haven't read the book yet, don't even bother about it. Just read till Chapter 3, then jump to the last chapter, and you'll still get the gist of the story.Grisham did not flesh out the characters fully, and it's very difficult to sympathise with Marlee or any other characters.This book completely turns me off from trying any of his other books!!!"
4,Entertaining read,"I read this a couple of years ago - it was my first John Grisham novel. Though I enjoy sci-fi novels, I'd heard plenty about Grisham and decided to give it a spin. I wasn't disappointed. I finished Rainmaker recently and while I think Rainmaker is better, that doesn't mean this is at all a bad read. Like Rainmaker, this is about little people v a big corporation. Rudy Baylor in Rainmaker was fleshed out, the characters in here are not as fleshed out, as the story concentrates on the individual members of the jury. I like that, it made for a unique kind of novel, and a highly enjoyable one, so 4/5 stars. Great work, Mr. Grisham!"
3,A good story lost in the midst of too much testimony.,"It was funny to read the characters in this book lament that the trial was taking too long. I felt the same way about the book. The premise is very good, but it appears that Grisham had an axe to grind against tobacco and wasn't about to let the story get in the way of his chopping. Ultimately, it was mildly satisfying, but would have been better with about 200 fewer pages."
5,The best legal thriller by John Grisham I couldn't lay it,down! Great suspense! Great characters in the best legal thriller by Grisham. I had to keep reading it! Un-down-putable! Great plotting and the timing couldn't be perfect when the book came out!
4,"Excellent, but not his best.","For 500 pages almost nothing happens, the goodies never put a foot wrong, the baddies are always caught on the hop and the ending is the one that you were expecting (but hoped would surprise you). Nevertheless, it's so well written that I could hardly put it down."
2,Least interesting of all Grisham's books,"Grisham often has heroes who have so carefully crafted their battles against their enemies that the pleasure comes not from seeing who will win, but in watching the hero's scheme unwind. We marvel at their cleverness (THE PARTNER) or snicker at the way they take on and destroy richer, smarter, larger law firms (THE RAINMAKER).However, in RUNAWAY JURY, this device truly saps almost all the drama from the story. We never doubt the outcome for one second, nor are the machinations particularly compelling or believable. All Grisham's books require heavy suspension of disbelief, but this book does not achieve that goal. I finished the book, but only in the hopes of a twist or something at the end. No such luck.Put this one at the bottom of your Grisham reading list...and if you've never tried Grisham, stay away from this one...you won't want to read any more, and then you'll deprive yourself of entertaining reads such as THE PARTNER, THE CHAMBER, etc."
