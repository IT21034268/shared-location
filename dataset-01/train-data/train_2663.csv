2,Not even worth the low price!,"Here's a good example of what to expect from this book:The learning curve theory says that the number of times a job is done doubles, the cost is reduced by 70%. If the first time cost is $1,000... the second time the job is done the cost will be $700.DOH!The book is full of stupid inaccuracies like that! It's not even up-to-date with the 1996 PMBoK (even though he's added a couple lines in the book to refer to the new 2000 version).The sample tests are very outdated.Save your money and just use the PMBoK!"
5,Comfortable right out of the box,"These sandals are superb. Comfortable right out of the box. Thank you for your great prices, quick response, and wonderful product."
2,Shoe Width,"The product description claims that this sandal is a European Narrow that equates to a US Medium. However, I was disappointed to find that it is definitely a narrow, not a medium. I feel the width description is very misleading if not incorrect. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008GI6WA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
5,happy as a clam!!!,i have searched all over for a pair of these!!! i like the idea that they are basically birkenstocks but at a more reasonable price!! i wore my last pair for over 5 years till they finally just decided to fall apart! glad i found this company!! would recommend them to everybody
3,Pretty Good Sandal,"These Betulas are not quite as comfortable as the original Birkenstocks, but are a good value for a similar product. They take longer to break in than the originals, but are an attractive sandal."
1,poor substitute,"Hi, I bought these because I was looking for a bargain birkenstock. No more. They don't hold up when wet, are a bit smaller than my real Birkenstock's and for the money, and I no longer wear them as they are so uncomfortable. I will always purchase the real thing. Sorry Betula."
3,Nice shoes...but came in narrow,I love birkenstock sandals and have worn two different sizes because sometimes only one or the other is available. I have also purchased the sandals and clogs in both regular and narrow widths. This company only sells the sandals in narrow widths. I am disappointed as it may be necessary to order a larger size to compensate for the narrow width. The sandals do look great!
4,MOST EXCELLENT AGAIN!,"I purchased these and another(different style). For the price I couldn't beat it. I could not believe how fast they arrived. Very Happy and will purchase from this company again. In fact, gonna order a pair for my daughter."
3,"Wonderful, but one small problem","I have worn birkenstocks before and I love that the footbead conforms to your foot. However, the reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the material covering the footbed started to peel off on the back of the shoe (heel area). Otherwise, very happy with the comfort of the shoe."
2,Faux Birkenstock,"Supposedly these sandals were manufactured by another company under Birkenstock specifications. However, the sizing to me is off. I have many size 37 Birkenstock sandals which fit perfectly--even though I wear an American size 8.5 Wide. These, however, are really too small. I didn't get around to returning them within 15 days. I thought it would be safe to get that size, but I would suggest no one buy these sandals on-line unless you don't mind sending them back if the size isn't right."
2,Don't compare to other Birkenstock Sandals!,"I have been wearing Birkenstock, Papillio sandals for over 10 years. These Betula Sandals are not built the same. First, when I opened box, the smell of sandals is strong. Second, Made in China stamped on shoe. I looked at all the pairs I owned, all made in Germany. Third, after wearing all day, the sandal made my left second smallest toe hurt. I wear Birkenstock sandals everyday for over 10 years, never have I had any foot pain, until I purchased these. Also color of footbed and cork on these sandals as pictured above, is different than on the pairs I previously owned. Maybe China can't duplicate Germany's quality."
3,It's really live!,"The first time I heard Adriana Varela sing was while I was listening to a CD from the group ""Bajofondo Tango Club."" Her singing style, and range caught my attention.So, I did the research and found this CD. Although as a heads up the entire CD is sung in Spanish.I think that it is wonderful."
4,Westernized Bollywood,"Not the usual musical rom-com from India but a triangle love drama that seems to borrow more from Argentinian and European film in showing the love, tragedy and suspense as the wealthy and the poor interact in Mumbai. Naturalistic cinematography showing how Mumbai breathes life; comfortably well acted by both novice and experienced actors; an acoustic stringed musical score by Santaolalla that gently guides the viewer through the life of the city along with our three protagonists. This is one of the few westernized Bollywood movies that I've seen that integrated both worlds without seeming commercial, shallow, misleading or culturally compromising."
4,"Quirky, catchy, sci-fi thriller.","Alien invasion has always facinated the movie going public. This ""invasion"" is carried out by a beautiful alien with, natch, ""jade green eyes"" who is travelling about the galaxy looking for a mate. The twists the plot take and the little surprise about the price of this girls love, make this a good read and a fun ride."
3,I'm sending it back,"After taking this bank apart and putting it back together a number of times, thinking I must have done something wrong, I finally concluded that it just won't work right. The gears are somewhat hard to turn, and coins routinely get stuck. Also, it's not something you can just move around - the coin keeper does not permanently attach, and the coin holders come out too easily. I did keep the box, and I'm returning it."
1,LImom,This toy was a huge disappointment!! Did not live up to its claims. Very difficult to put together. Poorly made. Difficult to work. Had to return it.
1,Disappointing,"This is one of the first toys I bought for my 5 year-old this Christmas, and was really excited to give it to him. He and his father put it together, and it was clear that this is a very cheaply made toy. The coins get stuck constantly, and, needless to say, it sits on a shelf untouched. I wish I would have kept the box - I would have returned it by now!"
1,Disapointed,Kids threw away the box and I ended up throwing it away. Never could get it to work correctly. It never stayed together. Now I see it wasn't just me who had the problem.
2,it is not worth it .,I got it for christmas two years ago and i play ed with it for two days and now it is sitting in a storage room broken.
3,Super cute,This is a really cool little Batmobile. Bought it for my super-hero obsessed son for Christmas this year. He likes it.Note that it is really small - a little larger than a Matchbox car. The photo makes it look a lot bigger.
5,Very lady like!,"I'm a girl that loves tools! And as a hands-on kind of interior designer, I'm always bringing my tools to client's houses to hang artwork or install window treatments. When I decided to replace some of my old manly tools with some newer ones, I looked at a lot of the tools made for women and they were too girly and pink for me. These are just right. They look great in my tool bag and fit perfectly in my small hands!"
5,a another good work of learning chinese,"Leaning Chinese Character is hard, especially for the kids western countries. Haohao Makes Havoc in Wordless city is a animation that also has many modern games factors in to it, make it so fun and so modern. Great for people who are learning Chinese to watch, also very fun. Great animation film. Suggest to all Chinese language schools to use.Great gift items"
2,"Engaging for kids, has English subtitles to help learners understand the dialogue.","Contains the subtitled word sh*t 14 times, according to my 8-year old, who was delighted about that. Since Amazon had this cartoon under ""children"" I didn't think to preview it. Subtitles are pretty silly in general but the main problem is that the translator apparently thought ""sh*t"" was a mild expletive. Not in my family."
1,Emotional nonsense,"Deere's arguments are appeals to emotions, all are far from being sound. They are refuted, along with other issues (freemasonery, etc.) in a book edited by Robert Thomas: The Master's Perspective on Difficult Passages (Master's Perspective Series, Vol 1). Thomas's books are rational, buy them instead!"
4,excellant,"I really enjoyed this book, it is fresh,warm and candid. Dr. Deere simply discovered that God is still God, and that he operates the same today as ever before, he challenges the view that some of the New Testament revelation has ceased to be relevant. His points are clear and entirely scriptural, there is nothing sensational or unorthodox in the book. A must read for serious Bible students."
4,Hate the Cover !!,"The cover is nowhere near worthy of the content. I understand the need to catch a person's eye and sell books but...I have several friends who I wouldn't mind sharing the book with, but the cover looks way too sensationalist to where I would be embarrassed to share it."
2,Not what you expect,"I bought this item as a Halloween decoration. I was disappointed with the color because this bulb looks very red when lit, not orange."
5,Perfect,These orange bulbs were exactly what I needed for Halloween decorating. They arrived quickly and none were broken!
3,Too red,"These bulbs are good quality but the light they give is very red, not orange, so doesn't suit our purpose"
3,Worked fine - fit my tiny 7 yo son,Fit fine - worked for my tiny 7 yo for halloween - material is very thin but for price can't complain.
4,Great Read!,This trade book came in on time and in perfect condition. I bought as a class requirement & I definitely learned a lot. Great read!
4,Scientific but a bit overkill,"Dr. Dweck is a giant in her field of motivation and I have followed her work on children and motivation,Her book makes the science simple but the stories are a bit redundant. I prefer more topics on achievement and would recommend suchbooks as Flow (Dr. C) and Full Throttle (Dr. Gregg Steinberg)"
5,Very Useful Book!,"Book provides very useful insight on our own behavior and that of family, friends and colleagues. She explains difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset and provides some good coaching on why and how to move to a growth mindset. Some excellent parenting tips - e.g., never tell your kid, ""you're so smart"" but ""you worked really hard to figure that out."" If you tell them they are smart they will think everything is easy and get frustrated when they have to work at something."
5,Calling All Leaders!,"Personal greatness as a leader rests on the foundation of a growth mindset. If you don't know what this means or how it differs from a fixed mindset, you will enjoy Carol Dweck's book. In Mindset she explains how a growth mindset is the basis for success in life, the ways a fixed mindset limit us and how to shift to a growth mindset. You will be inspired by examples of men and women we know who operate from a growth mindset and fascinated by the research she conducted on the impact of the different mindsets. An important book for us as individuals and for those of us who are influencing the lives of youth...boy did I make mistakes along the way!Susan Colantuono, CEOhttp://www.LeadingWomen.bizhttp://twitter.com/leadingwomen"
2,Good idea; not that great a book.,"The underlying principle of the book - that valuing hard work is ultimately a better motivator than valuing inherent ability - seems to be a sound one. As another reviewer said, the problem with this book is that the author gets that across in the first chapter. After that, it's example after example, anecdote after anecdote, hypothetical situation after hypothetical situation. The only tool the author offers that would help you to bring this principle to your life, is basically ""just do it"". Other than the repetition of ""you should value this rather than that, because it works better,"" you get nothing but a conclusion. I didn't find it that useful, even though I liked the underlying principle."
2,Disappointing read,"I learned of Dr. Dweck in a profile in Stanford Magazine, where she is a professor. Her research and resulting conclusions are fascinating and resonated deeply in our family. But the book is disappointing. As pointed out by C. Daley and J. Williams, the anecdotal material is extremely repetitive and not at all helpful. Notwithstanding its general reader focus, the ideas for how to move beyond a fixed mindset were limited. The Stanford Magazine article, which is excellent, is available online."
2,Repetitive stories,"The text as written certainly succeeds with many. In my case, I got the message after 3 or 4 repeats of the 'growth mindset can do it' theme. As story after story repeats the same theme, which is a good message, I began wondering when some background exploration would begin. It never happened.I've read other works by Dweck. She plays the role of editor in the recent ""Handbook of Competence and Motivation"" (in this book the two mindsets are called 'fixed' and 'incremental'). It is very academic and technical, but a treasure trove of insights. I liked it so much I'm going through it again with a fine tooth comb. I'd check Mindsets out at a bookstore or library. If you find yourself wanting more, take a look at Dweck's other books."
2,Repetitive and Misleading,"Mindset makes the argument that people who believe they can improve themselves will be more likely to take chances and grow.There. I've said it. Now you don't need to read the book.The rest of the book consists of stories that illustrate the above idea. Many many stories. All with the same lesson. The book is really a pamphlet.Also, I think the book is misleading. The latest research shows that we all have strengths and weaknesses and that we do best when we leverage these natural abilities. I think Mindset misses this point and, in fact, suggests the opposite.Now, Discover Your Strengthsis a much better book for those seeking personal growth."
1,Stop the Madness! Tell Me Once or Twice but not a Thousand Times!,"She says the same simple basic stuff over and over again. Common sense stuff. Its not so black and white on everything. Growth mind set vs. fixed mind set. Yawn, yawn, yawn. I soooooooo wish my boss had not made us read it. Wasted time I could have read enjoying other books.""The Seven Habits of Highly Successful People"" is much, much better than this repetitive thing...""Be curious! Believe you can learn! Don't give up! Have a good support team! Use it! Take risks! Don't be afraid to fail!"" And on and on and on . . . That is the growth mind set. And the fixed mind set is simply the opposite of those things.Another book that is much, much better than this one is, ""Influencer: The Power to Change Anything""."
3,Open Your Mind,"This is a stimulating book that reminds the reader that openness to learning, drive and hard work are more likely to result in success in life than is talent. My hesitancy in providing a higher rating is that the research supporting the concepts is referenced rather than reported in sufficient detail to enable independent assessment."
1,Don't waste your time,"I was referred to this book by a colleague in my efforts to understand the ""mindset"" of a couple of challenging students. I muddled angrily through the first three or so chapters, yelling at the author for her foolish conclusions and spurious anecdotes, easily contradicting her time after time, and finally ditching the effort.Anybody who has taken psych 101 will recognize that life and learning isn't this simple. And anyone who feels their life has changed after reading this book is going to need serious talk therapy down the road.Dr. Dweck has, apparently, a ""fixed mindset"". Anybody who can categorize all learning and motivation styles into two neat camps is stuck. Period.Avoid!"
5,Solid concepts plus anecdotes and research to back up,"I first read about Dweck and her research in a NYT article on child development. This is the dose of reality that we all need after years of ""positive thinking"" mantras. Without responsibility, action and growth-orientation, we block the positive path and fail to realize our potential. This book hammers the points home with detailed anecdotes from business, sports and general society.. plus the research that backs it up is solid."
3,A mixed review,"At first I was impressed with the book. The premise is that you can perform at a higher level when you believe that you have no limitations. The book also emphasizes humility, which I feel goes hand in hand with lasting achievement.The part I disagree with is that you should not praise others, especially children. Dweck writes, ""Remember that praising children's intelligence or talent, tempting as it is, sends a fixed-mindset message. It makes their confidence and motivation more fragile.""I can still remember the praise from my fifth grade teacher in Chugiak, Alaska. Many times over the years, his words have inspired me. He didn't think, ""I can't praise him, but I can praise his efforts."""
5,Mindset a Must Read,"Mindset was highly recommended to me by several people I really respected. It did not disappoint. Although Carol Dweck makes her point in the beginning of the book, she has some fascinating research that answered a number of questions I have had about why things happened they way they did. As an educator, I was drawn to the chapters that focused on how this may help my school in a practical way; however, I have been using the examples from the other chapters to promote the book to my colleagues. I was so taken by the book that I purchased one for every member of my school staff, including my secretaries, and for my PTO Board. I am looking forward to the conversations they will generate in the coming year."
4,Food for thought,"If you are a teacher, this book has definite food for thought about student attitudes towards work and challenges. Just wish there would have been some ways to put the theory to work."
3,Great concept. Needs more depth.,"A relative swore this book changed his life. Naturally, I had to read it. Didn't quite have the same effect on me. It did however elighten me on a slant of psychology I never paid much attention to, or rather, have never thought of before. I did take some benefit out of it. One major drawback is that it didn't spend enough time teaching you how to change your mindset, but rather gave plenty of examples od those that have different mindsets.In all, it's a decent read if you are frustrated in life and want a means to correct it. Great for parents raising kids, bosses, and anyone in a leadership position."
5,Life changing!,As an educator I am intrigued with how the brain works. This book gives a powerful rationale with ample evidence for how a change in mindset can change your quality of live and create success. Thoroughly recommended.
3,Failure or success?,"In Mindset, Carol Dweck points out the difference between people with growth mindsets, who just want to learn, and those with fixed mindsets, who feel a pressure to prove to others that they are smart. Fixed mindset people experience failure as something wrong with them. Growth mindset people use failure as an opportunity. Guess which mindset education, especially higher education whether experienced as a student or faculty, channels most people into. Dweck gives her readers information about how to get unstuck by changing their thinking into more successful patterns. Her book is heavy on examples: you can probably get the point by reading chapters 1-3 and 8."
4,Good book but real publishing date is 2006,"The book is bearing a publishing date of 2012, in fact, this is the UK publishing date of the 2006 edition, no more recent info here. This is misleading and it takes forever to get here since it is a UK book."
5,A Must Read!,"Everyone should read this book. I bought it as an educator to look into the impact of a teacher's mindset on his or her students. After a few paragraphs, however, I realized that this book has a message on the importance of a growth mindset that is important for anyone and everyone, not just educators or coaches. Dweck uses many anecdotes from real people that serve to make the work easy to relate to on many levels."
2,Carol Dweck On Nurturing a Growth Mindset,"In Mindset: The New Psychology of Success published by Random House, Inc. the author, psychologist Carol Dweck advocates that human beings must shed themselves of a ""fixed mindset"" and acquire a ""growth mindset"" in order to attain personal growth and progress. I am not a fan of motivational books; however Dweck makes sense; adults, especially those in charge of children ought to take her core ideas to heart. The book's premise may be summed up in Dweck's own words thus:""When we teach people the growth mindset, with its focus on development, these ideas about challenge and effort follow. Similarly, it's not just that some people happen to dislike challenge and effort. When we (temporarily) put people in a fixed mindset, with its focus on permanent traits, they quickly fear challenge and devalue effort.""Read the rest of my review on my blog at:[...]"
2,don't even bother,"This book is a waste of time, good things it's short, you can read it in a day if you don't find yourself throwing it in the trash before you get past page 3. Anyways find something else worthwhile to read."
2,"Good book, small primitive print","I had read some parts of the book and decided to own a copy. The price is not cheap but when I received the copy, it looks like everything is shrunk. The paper is very low grade and dark.Go for the hardcover or CD if you want to own one!!!!"
1,Mainly from a women's point of view,"Although Carol Dweck is a women, I feel this book would do well in a college ""women studies"" class. Good stuff, but a little tuff on guys and pity for women. Maybe I am stuck in a ""Mindset"", but harps a little too much on women issues for me. I will be alble to utilize some material from the book, but would suggest it as a good read for women."
3,Dale Carnegie revisited.,"I picked up this book because Po Bronson of ""Nurture Shock fame has praised it. I was disappointed. I was reminded of the books "" How to stop worrying and start living"" or ""How to win friends and influence people"" By Dale Carnegie with newer examples and a little research behind it. But Dale C did a better job in many ways. It did do a nice job reminding us that we are changeable, and that ""attitude is every thing"". But I don't need a whole book for that."
5,Praise,"Rich in authentic anecdotes and thorough research, the book is a wonderful vehicle for self-exploration, self-development, and growth focused meditation and thinking.Recommend to all"
4,Interesting book -- learning a lot,"I like the book quite a bit. I just finished Good to Great, which seems to go fairly hand-in-hand with Mindset. I'm not finished, but so far it's been a great read/listen. I'd recommend it as a good business/continuing education book. Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is the reader isn't my favorite voice on a CD. Not terrible, just not my favorite."
2,Could have been said in an article,"This book has an enlightening message that can be valuable when kept in mind However the author takes way too many liberties in explaining her development and reasoning. With so many management and leadership books out there, I wouldnt suggest taking time for this one."
1,Get a 1 page summary instead,"Thankfully, this book is a quick read. Dweck makes an interesting and compelling point but you'd be better off finding a similar 1 page article somewhere on the web.Here's one:[...]I thought that the workshop chapter would go into some more detail. But it was mostly about the praise that Dweck gets for the workshop she sets up! I call that chutzpah.Dweck makes the same point about 1,357 times.And oh, the near constant bragging is very annoying. Good thing she got a position at Stanford; she's going to fit right in with the Palo Alto folks."
3,An interesting concept...not worthy of a book,"Sorry, but Dweck's concept of mindsets is poorly displayed in this volume. The evidence is constantly reiterated. We got it the first time, and the second and third. It is also subjective and superficial. The first chapter which explicates the theory is probably worth the purchase, though barely. I had hoped for more."
2,20 Pages of Very Good Information,"The basic concept is set in 20 pages. The remainder of the book is applying them ,in detail, to a variety of situations. This could be interesting, but the application in each case is exactly the same. Once you understand the concept, you can make the same application yourself.The small amount of research cited is quite interesting, but the rest of the book is tedious and repetitive. This would be a great book to borrow from the library as opposed to buying."
1,A new edition?,"A new version at a much higher price than existing secondhand copies has been published, claiming to be a new edition.And yet so far it's impossible to find ANYWHERE, ANYTHING about how this new ""edition"" (as distinct from REPRINT) is any different.Publishers need to be HONEST."
2,Dirty front cover,"I am a little bit disappointed with how dirty the front of the book is. I felt a little bit uninterested to open and scan the pages because that is what I felt just by looking at the front cover. However, the fast shipping is my only consolation though..and it could be because I opted for expedited shipping. Sorry but I have to be honest with what I feel about the item."
4,A Sad commentary on Our culture,"Used as a textbook as part of a Social Anthropology course, this book presents a sad commentary on the imposition of a mechanized culture on a happy, but economically poor (according to OUR standards)culture. The author presents the material in a straightforward, factual manner that is easy to read and understand. If you're looking for blood and gore, this is not the ""assault"" for you. But if you're interested in a graphic example of what ""we"" have done to another culture, read this!"
2,Very dry and repetitive,This book is very dry in content and very repetitive! How many times do we have to read about the hippies! It is very hard to keep one's attention and interest. Very boring.
4,Quality little bird.,"This bird's call is very sweet sounding. The toy is very soft and plush, fits in the palm of your hand. It makes a great stocking stuffer. All ages seem to think it is adorable. I have not had for very long, so I cannot comment on how long the sound mechanism works, but so far, it works great."
3,The only savings grace of this forced betrothal was tha tLord Harry was a Complete Fop...,"He stated quite bluntly - and much to Isabbela's relief - that theirs would be a marriage in name only.But neither Harry nor Isabella was aware of the other's disguise - contrived in vain to thwart the impending nupitals. Isabella was not the selfish Ice Princess she seemed, nor was Harry a mincing dandy, but a prime Corinthian.A search for buried treasure and a thwarted suitor out for revenge add adventure to the marital mayhem, as two hearts discover that love lies no father than the enarest kiss."
3,Pleasant yet lacked depth,First title of Chesney's I've read. It was a good plot and had some interesting characters I would have like to have seen more of. It was a short read at under 200 pages. The ending was quick and not really to my liking in dept. It needed some more dialogue between Isabella and Harry.
5,First and foremost . . .,"Being the book that contains the first comic strips of Garfield, this should be a must-have for all Garfield fans. The introduction to Garfield, Jon Arbuckle, Odie, and Lyman (who disappeared in the early 80's) are featured here, and in full color! And sure, the old Garfield design doesn't look as remotely memorable as the newer appearances (walking on two legs, larger eyes, etc.), but we get to see what really defines the fat orange cat and his dim-witted owner here in this book. This is surely one of the most iconic strips ever produced."
5,Garfield at Large,"I bought the German version also of this book, as I am learning that language. I recommend it as a way of learning another language."
2,Where the legend began,"This book marks the first time Garfield ventured from the comic strips.Since this book was published, he has been featured in books, cartoons, movies, and countless tie-in toys and products.In this early outing, Garfield and Jon look quite a bit different from how they look today. Jon looks thin and anemic (even moreso than later), while Garfield looks fatter and uglier, like a grizzled old feline Walter Matthau. Odie looks basically the same.As the seminal edition, I would recommend this to anyone who likes their Garfield on the bookshelf rather than in the funnies."
1,"Garfield at Large, by Jim Davis","Now, as you can see in this panel, Garfield doesn't like Nermal! But like him or not, Nermal's here to stay! Or is he?! Let's find out."
5,I never read a Garfield book that wasn't funny,"In my humble opinion, this book is a collection of the funniest stuff around at the time. Now of course, there are more Garfield books, and they are getting funnier every publishing. It's interesting to see how much the illustrations changed from the first strip in the book to the last. Garfield was a baby cynicist in this book, a far cry from his full cynicism today. But of course, this has to be one of the best Garfield comic collections of all."
1,99- cent store,"Don't buy this. This is something you'd purchase from a 99cent store. It doesn't even come with enough pieces to fill up the entire board (it comes with 2 less). Also, there is no way you can ""travel"" with this.Avoid..."
1,dont waste the money,Dont waste your money! i love this game so i decided to bu one when it arrived in the mail i got 2 boxes and it came with 2 game but they are VERY crapy the chips get stuck and the toy does not look like it does on the picture i do not recommend this o anyone! buy one that isof better quality.
4,Great for Sensitive Skin but skip the ones with blusher brushes,See my other reviews on these products and do purchase/try 'cause theya are great; built-in brushes are lousy so get the other size versions in any other form/size/price that works for you. I blend colors of three shades for my perfect match.
3,My Aesthetician Loves It... Me? Less So,"So my aesthetician loves this stuff and recommends it to all her clients. I like it, but I strongly prefer the Colorescience ""bronzer"" (which is really a tinted moisturizer). I do think that if you like wearing mineral powder make-up, you will probably like this one even more because it won't dry you out or cause break outs. It's really good for your skin."
4,Good for oily skin,I purchased this because I have extremely oily skin (still at 47) and most creme sunscreen contains dimethicone which aggrevates my already too oily skin. This works out good because it it a powder and it contains zinc as a sunblock which is theraputic for oily skin.
1,Rip Off,"I have used this product for years, and I like it. Imagine my surprise when I received my latest refill - the product price is the same, but the quantity is LESS than HALF of what the refill size used to be! My previous refill was 13 g/0.45 oz. I just received a new refill - $23.00 - and it is 6 g/0.21 oz. It is about the size of of a lipstick tube, about three-quarters full. What a rip off! So deceitful - on the Colorescience website they do not mention the size or quantity of the refill - or that the current refill is less than half of what it was - a tiny, overpriced portion. I'll never buy it again!"
5,Great product,"I have really enjoyed this sleek desk organizer. I hate the metal and plastic ones, This gives me just the right amount of space and blends well to the desk."
5,Saved Our Desk Top,This inexpensive device saved our desk top of heat damage. Our first desk was damaged by the laptops heat; fortunately we were able to return the desk for a new one. This time placing the laptop on the notebook stand and absolutely no problems with the new desk top. Plus the additional USB ports are a blessing to have.
4,Historic Fantasy on a Grand Scale,"After a relatively tedious introduction to the Crucible Series in The Nameless Day, Ms Douglass has risen to the fast-paced narration and vivid characterizations which she renders so well in book 2. The portrayals of well known figures on the stage of history are refreshingly new, sometimes strange, but largely believable. The intertwined fantasy theme whereby the Judaeo-Christian angels are seduced by human females to procreate a race of demons which may only be destroyed by a human surrogate is certainly imaginative and novel, but lacks credibility, despite its commonality with the Zoroastrian view of the pagan pantheon. I am looking forward to the final book 3 resolution of this 14th century tale."
3,good safe..annoying alarm!!,the locker part of this toy is good and works well...the only annoying thing is the alarm! it wakes me up as its supposed to but the sound it makes is really irritating!! i say...if ur looking for a nice little piggybank kind of locker then buy this but if ur shoppin for an alarm clock...avoid this one to avoid cranky mornings.
4,If you like fun songs with vintage organs and sounds....slightly reminiscent of stereolab,"Surprisingly, this is still available on magicmarker records on crazy blue vinyl. If you like songs that have catchy ""ba-ba's and other non sense syllables with a vintage sound, then you should definitely pick this title up. The songs are catchy, infectious, and my favorite magic marker release to date. Fans of Stereolab should not be disappointed."
3,More The Virgin Soldiers than Platoon,"The ad line for The Odd Angry Shot promised `Cry a little, laugh a lot,' and that pretty much sums up the problem with the film. One of Australia's few efforts to portray their part in the Vietnam war, it plays more like a version of The Virgin Soldiers than Platoon, with much good-natured uttering of obscenities amid the tinnies and banter. It's not bad, has a cast filled with stalwarts of 70s and 80s Oz cinema (Graham Kennedy, John Hargreaves, John Jarret, Bryan Brown) and has its moments (most notably presenting the padre with a home made wanking machine), but it feels too soft and good natured to leave much impact. The final scenes do work surprisingly well, but odds are this one won't linger long in the memory.Decent extras on the Australian PAL DVD include audio commentary by Sue Milliken, Tom Jeffrey and Graeme Blundell, production notes and original theatrical trailer."
5,Are you ready to really experience GOD?,"I not only had a chance to read the book, but I met the author. I read the book on a challenge NOT interest. The challenge was... ""If you are not ready to have the LORD work in your life in a big way, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!"" I read the book and I promise you no sooner than I finished the last page, I began to see GOD work in my life to show me the results of being radically obedient. The results have been life-changing. This is one book that I am glad I took the time to read. It helped to strengthen my faith and opened my eyes to really see GOD work in my life. It was worth every penny and every minute of my time."
3,"Quick shipment, but not what I expected","I ordered the pink pink light bulb to put on my porch for Breast Cancer Awareness month. The bulb came in plenty of time, and was perfectly intact. The light also works very well and casts a srong glow. Unfortunately, that glow is red, not the expected pink, and now my house looks like it is part of the red light district! Very dissapointing. Still, I would consider coming to this seller again if I wanted, say, a blue lightbulb, as blue is blue in all shades."
5,Good to begin with,"Important Eclipse features are explained , in plain language. First time I see text where someone said in plain English what is JAR, Plug In and so on further.YOU HAVE TO KNOW JAVA BEFORE READING THIS (it's something you know already, I guess)."
2,"Death too Soon is hokey, but okay","This film may be hokey (like to sound effects for Cap's stength), but it's not so bad. It trys to stay close to the actual comic character, but makes him somewhat bland. I'd recommend it for the avid comic collector,but don't watch it too often, you may go crazy."
3,Old enough to remember this one too.,"OK. So you got past the hokey remade origin of Cap in the first one and, granted, he's got a clear shield of plastic and a motorcycle helmet. But hey, the story got a little better. When terrorists threaten to unleash a plague virus, Captain America steps it up to put a stop to it.These movies aren't bad bad, but as a little kid who liked comic books, Cap was the Man. Still is, although, whereas I'd admit I owned a Batman movie, I'd keep this one in the closet. I'd get it and the first one ONLY if you were a DIE HARD comics fan. (Like me.) eeeeesh."
3,what is this,I love the first movie Lilo and Stitch it was so cute i got all excited for Stitch and I was disspointed in it. IT way to short the story line get really long. Plus the animation isn't all that great at all I mean disney could so so much better but what do you except from disney either there sqeauls are good or not why they couldn't do better on the animation i don't know but it would be a cute movie for very young kids.
2,Does not live up to expectations,"The video store in my town by accident released this movie four days early to rent. I loved the first movie, Lilo and Stitch, and was expecting this to be just as good. But, it definately does not live up to the first one. It's cute, and the other 625 experiments are very cute, but it's really missing something. The first movie had Elvis' songs and songs especially recorded for the movie, that give it the Hawaiian feel. All of that is missing in this movie. I also didn't think this movie was as funny as the first, and in someways it doesn't really seem like it takes off right where the first one ended. Sadly, it doesn't live up to expectations."
3,C'MON PEOPLE!!!!???,"Being a Disney fan, I should say THIS IS NOT A SEQUEL!!! It's simply an introduction to the TV series. There is an actual Lilo and Stitch II coming this year or the next. So, CHILL OUT!Um, as for the movie, it was okay. They should have shown it on TV instead tho."
4,Stitch -- The TV Pilot,"Stitch! The Movie is a good movie, although you have to have seen Lilo & Stitch to understand it. It's quite short, and nowhere near as good as the original. I was irritated by the fact that it turned out not to be a real movie, but essentially the pilot for a TV series coming this fall. Still, I'll watch the series, too; this was a 4-star movie.So, what happens if Stitch's 625 previous experiments are let loose? That's the premise of the TV series, not this movie. Only two new ""cousins"" appear in this movie--625 and 221--and only 221 has a major role. In the series, Lilo & Stitch will interact with all the other experiments; I wish they could have done a bit more in the movie."
3,Stop complaneing .,OK so this movie is the start of the tv series and dosen't have any of the emotional things but this wasnt a bad movie at all it was a prologe to leoroy and stich and it wasnt suposed to be the next Pokemon eather if it was it would of launched with thosand of merchindise shure it had a few things like coloring books and video games but cartoon dosen't botom line it's not a sequel or a fad it's a prologe.
3,Solid Sequel....Obvious Marketing Tool,"""Stitch!"" is a decent sequel considering it was direct-to-DVD. Most Disney sequels that garner that title are lifeless, but this movie does have an interesting story that does hold your attention for the short amount of time it takes to watch. My 2 year old likes this movie, but even she rathers to watch the original.In typical Disney fashion, this is a blatant infomercial for the Disney Channel series ""Lilo & Stitch."" I have yet to watch the series, but if this movie is any indication, I'm afraid the story will run its course rather quickly.If you have little ones, this movie is a reasonable investment. If you're one of those people who buys Disney movies because that's just your thing, skip this one."
5,good dvd,another good dvd from this series. purchased it for my grandson and he loves all their dvds. he has a blast with them.
3,Very Entertaining Movie,This movie is very entertaining and keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. In very good condition. Would recommend this to everyone.
1,Bad Quality,I have tried streaming a few movies from Amazon and the quality has been horrible! Any movie I have rented to watch has never finished. It stops and goes and the sound is off. It's very confusing to me cause the movies on PRIME don't do that. But when I actually pay to watch a movie I never actually get to enjoy the movie. Very disappointing. And it's for that reason I wont pay to stream from amazon anymore. Any other service I have used for streaming has worked amazing. Guess I will stick with those.
3,This is the pilot for the TV show,"This movie is actually the pilot for the Disney channel weekly show, in which it is Lilo and Stitch's mission to somehow recover all 625 of the other ""illegal genetic experiments"" like Stitch (experiment 626) who escaped onto the Hawaiian islands. The glaring quality differences are obvious, because this is just your average made-for-TV serial pilot. This is not technically a sequel, and should be judged simply as a kid's cartoon."
3,Not at all like the movie,"The characters act differently, the script was not given much attention. The movie lacks the creative composition the first boasts. The chemistry between the charaters is not present. Movie plays more like a long cartoon. Animation not as good as in the movie. Jokes and plot not properly developed and written. Overall, not as entertaining. This includes the bonus features in the DVD version. Adults will not like this one, kids, especially young kids, maybe."
2,the almighty buck,"OK, my 3 year old likes it. But anyone over age 10 will notice glaring differences between the original Lilo and Stitch and Stitch the Movie. The lack of effort and emphasis on the backgrounds of the scene are obvious. While L&S had lush, detailed beautiful scenes of Hawaii, these backgrounds provide the bare minimum in background graphics and detail. It looks like they hacked it out as fast as possible. The fact that the production crew was different from the first graphics production crew is also obvious because there is a different feel to the style. The music track is perfunctory. I recommend that you check it out from a store before you spend $20 on it. I wish I had."
4,A worth to buy sequel!,"I have heard from some critics that this movie was so dissapointing. I hardly agree. Though the movie does lack the funny kick in the ... laughter, this sequel seemed to do very well! I bought the movie today, and watched it once I got home. I loved it. It was a 'cute' movie. I know what 'Pokemon' is, and I do not agree it's going to be like that. I love disney movies, and I will always do. But if they do make sequels, make it more thrilling than the original! (or the same)The Special Features, I do not really care for. They are not worthy seeing."
1,Would have given it less,"Although this one of my kids' favorite movies to watch, for the time being at least, I found it to be nothing but a commercial for the cartoon series on Disney. The animation is not up to the standards in the movie, the music lacks spark, and the story line is transparent and trite. I feel taken for the $$ I spent on it."
2,"Even dumb, redundant Stitch movie isn't ALL bad!","I do not like this film. That's not a good sign because I even liked ""Tarzan & Jane"". Yet, just about anything with Stitch can't be all bad. There are a few good moments, like when Stitch and Sparky copy each other. But what I didn't like was all the space parts. The ""mild sci-fi action"" is why ""Lilo & Stitch"" was rated PG, but this is rated G and has 10 times as much! I like the TV show, (...)."
1,stitch or pokemon?,"if your and adult and love the first moviedo not get this one it is stitch the movie,a movie to start the TV show.check the rating lilo and stitch PGstitch the movie Gthis movie is too happy no worrylike the TV show.no real drama like the first movielilo comes from a broken familyand stitch a destructive alienthere has to be new problemsfrom there personalities,but the TV show has them have happy advancers.l thank goodness they mad the real sequellilo and stitch 2and I wish there was a worningabout the kids only stitch SHOWI was a shock to see that a cool space fantasy/broken familywas tern in to a lets catch a monster show.belive me I seen the episodes ther nothing likethe first movie.get the lilo and sitch 2it had them at ther bestwith a even deeper drama."
5,it was ok,hey did you guys think it was going to be as good as the real movie hey it came out on video and dvd not the theater if it came out on theater than it wounld be jeap. be side you guys are so old and you like lilo and stitch ha ha
3,Too Saturday morning cartoon,I was excited to see that there was a follow up to Lilo and Stitch and the previews and marketing lead you to believe that you will be seeing a lot of the other 625 experiments. You do not. There are two other experiments released and they are not very important to the movie. The little hampster-rat thing looked as though it walked straight out of one of those cheap cartoons that are on at 5am. My recommendation is that you stick to the first one. This is less of a movie than it is an attempted teaser for the new cartoon show.
3,Stitch- Marketing Ploy,This movie is not as good as the original. The animation is like a cartoon show on TV versus a made for release movie. The story is also not as good - no real new ideas. It is very obviously simply a tool to get kids ready for their new fall TV show. I really resent that the children are being used this way. If I had realized that fact I would not have purchased this DVD. Disney should be ashamed!
2,Cheap Pokemon ripoff!,"After Lilo & Stitch, I was really looking forward to this one! Turns out, it's nothing more than a 55 minute long setup for the Lilo & Stitch TV show this fall. It's also yet another Disney ripoff of a Japanese show. This time they got Pokemon. At least Lion King had a decent plot.Only 623 experiments to go. ""Gotta catch 'em all"""
3,"great action, good feelings slow humor.",While this movie has all the sweet charm of the first with feeling people can definatly relate to. Like the fact of not fitting in. I'm sure everyone has felt like that. The action is well done to keep attention of viewers. some of the jokes & running gags got a little worn thin from over repeative use. Still I'd recoment this movie highly.
2,Disney Sequels ...,"this thing is awful, all it is is the pilot episode for the series they are going to have on ABC soon. The character animation is all off, even stitch, who you'd think they'd realize was the most important character was done wrong for most of the film. Jumba, nani and David all look wrong as well. If you were looking for a sequel to the WONDERFUL original film, move on, because this ain't it. It's disney's new version of Pokemon. If you're just out for more of the stitch attitude, at least he shines through from time to time."
3,BAD ENDING,The ending seems unfinished. After watching the whole movie you expect to see some of the 'cousins' - but you don't ! When the movie ends you are still waiting for more....I guess they want you to buy all the upcoming ones. But if all the upcoming ones end like this - don't waste you money. We expected better.
1,So sad,"I love Lilo and Stitch. I don't even mind that my 2 year old has watched it almost every day for the last 6 months. That's why this pathetic, rushed and careless sequel makes me so sad. The animation is third rate, the voices actors sound bored and diretor-less and the script falls flat- relying on catch phrases and noises from the first movie. I kept waiting for the Scoobie Doo soundtrack to start. My daughter cried and said ""but I want my Lilo and Stitch"". Yeah, me too."
2,disappointed,"While still enjoyable, this film lacked much of what made the original ""Lilo and Stitch"" movie enjoyable for adults as well as children.The drawing was too simple and the film included very little music at all (especially compared to the first movie). Stitch's mischievious ways were almost totally reformed leaving Stitch more like a blue, six-legged, teddy bear. The sequel carried virtually none of the Hawaiin tradition from the first film. Also, the sequel paid very little attention to Lilo and her sister's family situation.The sequel is an obvious rush job and an even more obvious segway (sp?) to the upcoming TV cartoon. It has a srong ""Pokemon"" feel to it (""Gotta catch em all"") rather than the feel of the first ""Lilo and ""Stich"" movie.This movie could have been much better, however Disney chose to totally overkill the idea of Stitch's cousins and left out too much of the original characters' traits."
4,Didn't know what to expect,"I have wathed Lilo and Stitch, and it was preety good. But when I heard about this, I laughed. the only reason i got this was for the Jump5 music video (even though it doesn't show Jump5, just plays the song). Then I watched the movie cuz I was bored, and I loved it! It's so hilarious. I thought it was corny and cheesy, but I loved it! I reccomend this to for the whole family!"
2,"Cute, but I wouldn't buy it.","The mischievous charm is missing in this cute but mundane followup to Lilo & Stitch. It makes for a fun rental, but I would avoid buying this video/dvd--if you do, you'll find out in the ""Coming Attractions"" that you've basically bought the pilot for the upcoming Saturday morning cartoon series. In the ad for the series, you discover Lilo and Stitch will basically spend the run of the series pursuing the 625 experiments released in ""Stitch."" In a sentence, rent the pilot, then watch the series."
2,Don't expect too much,"I really enjoyed the original Lilo & Stitch so this was an automatic buy. Same charactors, weak story, and only one good song. Also, only 62 minutes long including credits. My kids enjoyed it ok, but it did not work at the adult level like the original. ... Retail is a bit much for an hour long cartoon. ..."
3,"Almost, but not quite.","I loved the first ""Lilo And Stitch"" film, and was saddened to see how much of a rush job Disney did on this sequel. This hour-long feature is, of course, not as good as the original film, but still has its moments. The plot is that all the previous genetic experiments that led to Stitch (""Number 626"") are being unleashed on an unsuspecting world. The problem is that we don't really get to see much of them, or to revel in their chaotic qualities the way we did with Stitch in the first film. Also, the scriptwriting and comedic timing are a bit sluggish, particularly in comparison to the lightning-fast, exuberant brilliance of the first film. This is more of a typical for-little-kids Disney knockoff, with about as much emotional impact as an average Saturday morning cartoon. A pity, really, since I still felt invested in and sympathetic towards all the characters, and if the producers had put a little more creative effort into it, this could have been a *lot* of fun."
3,Not as good as the first one,"My husband and I fell in love with the first movie of Lilo and Stitch and were quick to rush out and buy the sequel. I have to say it was a bit disappointing. The premise was that there were 625 other experiments before Stitch came to be, which would lead you to think that there would be more interaction between Stitch and his 625 ""cousins."" He only interacted with 2 of them. It is clear that ""Stitch! The Movie"" was all a set up for the upcoming cartoon series to be shown on the Disney station. The cartoon graphics were not as sharp as in the original movie which is to be expected going right to DVD. I guess we were just spoiled by the excellence of the first movie. On a positive note, all the voices were the same as in the first movie. You've gotta love the voice of Stitch!"
2,The ending stinks,"Every part of the movie was sorta great, but the ending stinks, it doesnt even show all of Stitches cousins in the movie, i thought it would be better, but I guess I was wrong."
1,direct to video should have been direct to toondisney!,"my four year old REALLY loved Lilo and Stitch so I got her this movie for her birthday. What a disapointment! Flat animation, dull plot, NO MUSIC TO SPEAK OF, just a very dull production. This movie was saved from 0 stars only because that rating is not available. The whole thing is just an expensive (relative to quality) trailer for the new Disney channel cartoon series. Seems to me Disney is trying to cash in on the (fading) popularity of Pokemon, and they don't even try to hide it. The movie box includes a sheet of all the 625 stitch ""cousins"" so the children can keep track of them, even though the movie includes only two of them. hmmm....wonder where they can see the rest? only toon disney knows for sure......"
1,Disapointed...,"The whole family loved ""Lilo and Stitch"" - we did not love ""Stitch the movie""....in truth - as far from love as possible - if you and your children enjoyed ""Lilo and Stitch"" do not buy ""Stitch the move""!!!!!!!! Sad but true......we could not wait till this sequel came out........ and now we are all sad that we own this movie......when ""Lilo and Stitch"" was such a wonderful movie. If you feel that you need to see for yourself - rent do not buy!"
1,Paranoid Christian Propaganda,"This book was a waste of my time and money. If the writer was attempting to strengthen the world view of Christianity he failed; instead, his beleifs came across as a jumble of semi coherant propaganda, revealing an insecurity in his beliefs. One of the statements: ""Little do young Rock and Rollers know they are deceived by an unseen host of agents of the devil,"" made me laugh out load. Is he kidding. That's just plain ignorance. I guess Bob Geldorf and all those Rockers who got together in the 80s and put on a cocert for all the people starving in Africa are really just agents of Satan. And while I'm at it, all the Rock stars who got together to raise money for people hit by the events of 9/11/01 were agents of the Devil too. This book is what's wrong in the world folks. But don't take my word for it. Give it read. You might be surprised that people actually still beleive this stuff"
3,Interesting if not a little inaccurate,"This book will keep you hooked from beginning to end due to it's complex theories on satanic influence and witchcraft. However I have found that many references pertaining to the wiccan religion were very wrong. I am a christian myself and I am very aware of this secret 'orginazation' that really controls world events, but to make sure it is true you must do your own research - and not just in the Bible either."
1,Illuminati 666,"People, People this is the same old conflict between those who can truly ""see"" and the ""blind leading the blind"". You can call yourself an expert, you can have years and years of research bahind your back, you can be an expert of the LAW, a Pharisee, and still miss the TRUTH. This book is filled with half truths, which are dangerous. In many ways the writer is right but he keeps missing the REAL TRUTH, his inner truth. HE IS A BLIND MAN, LEADING THE BLIND, and all who follow him will fall in the pit. ENOUGH SAID."
2,666 the urban legend,"I agree with reviewer(achaean)about this book. When will people stop believing in myths. First of all the devil is a concept that comes from Zoroastrian ideas. It is a myth to keep people in fear and control. Look around, works real well. Next 666 has nothing to do with the devil. It is a number associated with the sun. Get it(sun of man). If people would do their research and stop having preconceived notions and beliefs in their heads when looking for answers,we would not be having this problem. It all goes back to the Ego and control of others. 666 and the Devil are the best tools on the market to envoke fear and hate towards others and the unknown......Why 2 stars???? For the overall amusement of such ridiculous ideas with no proof to back them up...."
1,This book is BAD.,Filled with historical inaccuracies that I caught during my first reading in highschool. The author apparently did not have access to simple refrence books.Stay away.
3,does not work,"When I opened the phone-radio, it had no instruction book and when it was set up to charge it did not have the charge light on nor did the radio or clock operate. I would like to have a phone number for cybershops of L.A. as that is the return address on the shipping box. Can you provide me with a phone no. to contact Cybershops? Thank you. M.A.C."
3,snow balls 2 ...,"well this one has allot of snow balls, the special features realy ring a forcast ...although theyve left yet something to do but what oh i knowbut for got having an uneven day ...so the game is sufficiant but sc3 didnt have a game i was surprized a little oh ya hey thats not yours is it ????shaken not stered comparing to santa who the language is quite different color content seen ....fffffffffffffffffffffFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF............SANTAS HELPER ...JR"
4,#2 is the best,Considering that the 1st one was pretty good and the 3rd one sucked I honestly have to say that the second one in the series is the one I loved the best. It is destined to become a classic for my 8 year-old daughter!All the elements of a long lasting Christmas traditional viewing are there!
3,More for Kids,"Though I enjoyed watching this one too. I found it to be more for the kids this time. The first Santa Clause had more for the entire family, young and old alike. This version was definately in line with young fantasy. But, isn't that what Christmas is all about. Merry Christmas!"
2,"It's A Wonderful Life, this ain't","Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, and this is one of the better movies of today. But even as a fantasy, this film is mediocre at all standards.Scott (Tim Allen) has been divorced from his marriage in the first movie and, as 'Santa', he needs to find a Mrs. Claus before Christmas Day or else... And time runs short.Charlie, now a grown-up teenager, gets in trouble for defacing school property. Not once, but several times. And the school's outer wall has grafitti all over it.One of the better parts of the film is that the school staff gets the toys they wanted since their childhood days ... good for a chuckle or two, but warm-hearted nevertheless.Yet another advertisement for Christmas commercialism."
4,about the case?,"I need an answer to a question concerning the case. I recently bought a used Santa Clause 2 movie and it had a cheap flimsy case wirh a frame backing covered over with transparent material. Did Disney do that or did the seller? I don't want to make a false accusation against the seller, but I can't amagine Disney doing such a thing. Would you please respond. I need to know one way or the other."
2,Disappointing,"This movie proved that most often then not a sequal rarley holds the charm of the orginial. While this movie had some nice points (the carraige ride) mostly it fell flat and left the question was it not better to leave well enough alone?? The Santa Clause is a classic, the Santa Clause two is not!"
3,"Come On, Join In the Christmas Spirit!","I wasn't betting lots of money on the Santa Clause sequel when it came out, but after seeing it, I found out it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. The plot was fun, and overall, the movie was cute and it had a good message.The DVD is really fun, too! There are deleted scenes, a tour of the elves workshop with 2nd head elf, Curtis, and even a fun game (which I still haven't beat!) If you have young children who still believe, or older ones who want to keep the spirit alive, please purchase this DVD!"
4,A great holiday tradition...,"My family and I have a tradition that every Christmas Eve we sit around all day watching Christmas movies. The Santa Clause has always been our favorite and now it's great to have the sequel to add to the collection.In my opinion The Santa CLause is adorable, I found myself laughing throughout the entire movie. Personally I think the star of the movie is the baby reindeer, he is so cute and endearing.My family and I strongly recommend this movie to anyone in the holiday spirit."
1,We had to leave after about 15 minutes.,"I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone could sit through this pile of unoriginal--and unfunny--drivel. I had to tell my two children to give it a chance after each of them, about 5 minutes in, turned to me and said that they wanted to sit in the car. It's that formulaic, that predictable, and that boring. God, even Ice Age, as lame and unoriginal as it was, didn't drive us from the theater like this steaming bowl of tripe. Hollywood, believe it or not, has really hit a new low with this awful stuff. But, for all of you who love mediocrity, enjoy.I feel so much better getting this off my chest.And if you want to see a real film for children and adults alike, with real intelligence and real humor, go see Spirited Away. Problem is, most theater chains don't give their audiences enough credit to show such films."
2,Another bland House of Mouse sequel,"My family and I enjoyed the first one immensely. That said, this one left us flat. While it had some of the same ideas and turns of phrase that made the first one so endearing (i.e. the ""Mrs. Clause"" and the Tooth Fairy character), the story itself was formulaic and uninspired. The result is the latest in a series of bland 'House of Mouse' sequels that attempts to cash in on the success of its predecessor. Heavy on glitz, but thin on substance. Without Tim Allen, this effort would have been another straight to video sequel, and in my opinion, it still should have been. Definitely recommend you rent it before buying."
1,This sequel is horrible!,Same actors returned at least but it looked too different from the first one. They should have never made a second one. I'm really curious of what Santa Clause 3 is going to be like but I bet it's going to be disappointing like the second one. I really enjoyed the first one a lot and it was funnier but this one just seemed too disappointing. The first one is way better do not watch this one it sucks.
1,"I should have known, I think I did, but I had to see it once -- now I don't need to see it ever again","I don't have any good memories of Santa Clause from childhood -- now, I was hoping to see something good from Tim Allen and on the Dude -- but something about flops seem to be the only thing that comes from this film -- well, the evil tim toybot seems to have won in the end -- save your money and find something better to watch -- like perhaps 20 straight playings of the exact same episode of Barny the Dinosour without a break --"
3,Not as good as the first movie,This is not one of the top Christmas movies that are priority to watch every year. The first one was better.
4,Santa Clause 2 good but not the original,After seeing the first Santa Clause with Tim Allen (who is one of my favorite actors/comedians) I figured this one would be just as good. It's not... I still enjoyed the movie but it wasn't no where near as good as the first Santa Clause. The plastic Santa Clause was just wrong and kind of creepy. Although Tim Allen was great as usual the movie just didn't have the pizazz the first one did.
2,Why???,"Ok, after I saw this film; I couldn't stop thinking Why??? I mean I didn't hate it, but I thought of several different ways the film could have been told. ( Ex. In the first, Charlie said that he planned on going into the Family Business!) They could have waited a few more years and done a film where Charlie became The Santa Clause and Scott Calvin ( Tim Allen fell from the rooftop just like it all started out)! Oh well... I could go on and on but.....I still like the first movie myself! As for Tim Allen ---You bet!!!"
4,Good Sequel to Santa Clause...,"As sequels go, this was a good one, to the first Santa Clause movie... especially liked the scene with all those teachers and their getting their retro toys after all these years... and those evil giant wooden soldiers (all they needed there was to have was two of the elves doing a ""Laurel & Hardy"" parody!)"
4,Good family movie,"It's not as good as the first movie, but it's still a good movie the whole family can enjoy."
5,Tradition,"If you have the first, you have to have the second. This is also part of my tradition every xmas and in between. Love it."
5,Santa Clause 2 DVD,"Good movie, enjoyed it very much. Did not have to wait long to have it shipped to me. Amazon is very good about shipping what I order in a timely manner."
2,"Ho ho ho, hum.....","I'm an adult, who loved the first Santa Clause movie, but the second one was, to put it bluntly, quite simply awful. In trying to analyze what I didn't like about this flick, I decided I thought the script was rather poorly written, cutesy and lacked the spontaneity of the first film. Also too many sappy scenes at the north pole, and way too many elves! And WHAT is up with the low budget reindeer? Ick.I also wanted to see more of Judge, whose therapist character is rather funny. However, he kept getting interrupted by the Tim's character which was just annoying. I also felt the main character's son's delinquacy was rather out of character and not fully explored.Small children might enjoy this film entertaining, but I thought it was just plain silly. This film would be vastly improved by a better script, and less reliance on flashy CGI, and of course, more Judge."
1,Horrible Remake,"This remake in my opinon is not as good as the original. The reindeer are some fake retards, and the elves and story line all together is horrible. Watch it at a friends house first, rather then buying it first."
3,Still Has That Magic Feeling,"""The Santa Clause 2"" was enjoyable, but clearly not as good as the original. Tim Allen returns to portray Scott Calvin, a.k.a. Santa Claus only this time he needs to find a Mrs. Claus in order to remain as ole St. Nick with 28 days and counting. Meanwhile, his son Charlie is becoming the rebellious teenager getting into trouble on an almost daily basis in school. Scott wants to address his son's problems immediately with Christmas approaching; therefore, he leaves the North Pole in the hands of a toy replica Santa who runs the North Pole like a Russian dictator soldiers (toy, of course) and all. One really cute scene was Santa holding a meeting with Mother Nature, Father Time, The Tooth Fairy and Cupid. Plus every child knows he's Santa whether or not he looks the part. The film will provide that warm and fuzzy feeling as the first."
5,Great movie,"I really enjoy this one a Tim Allen gets himself in trouble again. Another twist to add to the clause! Great for the whole family, Keeps you entertained throughout the entire movie. A must buy if you have the first one."
3,Not the greatest,"This movie is a time killer, not an enjoyable experience. The first one was better. The cheese in this one is too much to handle."
5,This is a great book for kids of all ages!,"When I have to look up something for school, or for fun, this is a great book to look whatever I want up! And it's all safe for kids to use too."
1,Do NOT give your children this book,"The idea this book is geared toward children breaks my heart. The fact there are people in this world who believe the things written in this book break my heart. Sit down and have a real talk with your children instead, do not let them be brain washed into thinking the ideas presented in this book are fact. It tells them that natural, normal feelings about sex, hormones, relationships and authority essentially make them horrible, slutty people who are going to hell. Sit down and open a dialog with your child and the bible instead. It's not wrong to feel or think certain things, it's the actions you take afterward that count. The teenage years can be so confusing and many emotions or thoughts can come up. Help your kid understand them and channel them to be productive, don't let these authors brain wash them into thinking they are horrible people."
4,Ambitious attempt at covering 20th century architecture,"I read this book for an architecture class. This book is an excellent text book or reference material because of the comprehensive coverage. The depth of material varies according to the importance of architects. For example, Le Corbusier had several chapters devoted to him while I.M. Pei was barely mentioned. The organization of materials is chronolgical, which makes it somewhat discontinous. But overall, it's a good book for intermediate readers."
1,Complicated language.,"I gave up in trying to read this book. The language is too advanced for someone simply studying 20th cenury architecture class, unless this is your field of studies or you are going to write a thesis."
3,Expensive to be used.,It is in very good conditions but it was only ten dollars under it's original(new) price. Expensive to be a used book!
4,Good source of information,this is a really good reference book becuase it provides many precedents of architecture that are really good to look at for ideas and cocepts.
5,Exceptional book,"Since several others have shared similar comments, all I can do is confirm that this is truly an exceptional book, filled with very informative and well-written text and many rare illustrations."
4,Very good book,"If you've ever wanted to know the difference between Art Nouveau and Modernism (for example) this book will help you understand it, and provide you with notable examples of each. And many, many more of the styles and -isms of the last 100 years.Yes, I read every page. Carefully. Sometime soon I will do it again."
3,pretty survey,"This is the kind of book I found stimulating before I actually learned something about architecture. Curtis seems to argue that composition, tectonics, personal triumph, modernist orthodoxy and mythos are the big ingredients of 20th Century architecture. As if you can't make junky architecture from that recipe, and the damage from those ideas isn't all around us. Any ""Uncomplicated"" reading (to me) is non-compelling, but I guess that's what surveys are. I'll be damned if I can tell you what Curtis' overall thrust or polemic is, beyond ""Modern Architecture is neat."" Social responsibility and political meaning are pretty much missing here. No matter how much I read it, nothing sticks. The design is nice, which is what I suspect people are reviewing here."
4,Nuthin' Fancy,"This Album Stands By It's Title. This Album Has Great Songs Like ""Saturday Night Special,"" ""On The Hunt,"" ""Am I Losin',"" The Country Tune Of ""Made In The Shade,"" in which Lead Singer Ronnie Van Zant Gives A Yodel, & ""Whiskey Rock-A-Roller."" The Three Songs I'm Not So Fond Of Are ""Cheatin' Woman,"" ""Railroad Song,"" & ""I'm A Country Boy."" This Album Also Features Two More Songs, Live Versions (Bootlegs) Of ""Railroad Song"" & ""On The Hunt."" These Songs Aren't That Bad This Way. This Album Is OK & Is A Good Third Effort. I Still Would Recommend It."
3,face value,"this album is exactly what it reads, 1's, but isn't the Now Compilation CD's usually 1's??? so they left out a ton of great songs, and added a lot of crappy ones, if you're into music at all, you've already got most of these songs, the only reason to own, is if you collect now cds, and just want this one to add to your collection."
3,wait a minute,"nearly none of these songs were chart toppers. Why did they put J.Lo's love dont cost a thing(NOW 6). that one only hit #1. A beeter choice would be ""i'm real""(Not sure, i think now 8) it was on a now album, but its not here. Story of a girl(now 5) and again(now 6) werent number one, but they were one of the biggest rock hits on these compilations, so they are okay. Survivor(now 7) was #2, but the other hit bootlicios(now 8) was #1, so why wasnt it chosen instead? Pieces of Me was unneeded, and Janet Jacksons All for You(now 7) was not as big as Doesnt really matter(now 5) so i really dont understand the tracklist at all. some of these artists had bigger hits than this, but the wrong songs were chosen. Oh, NSYNCS Bye Bye Bye (now 6) was only #3, but Its Gonna Be Me(now 5) was #1. The songs,however, are fun, so that is why it got three stars. So i recomend this CD, but not all these songs were #1."
5,AWESOME CD,I love this CD i say if you don't like this CD then don't say anything some people happen to like it! you must have an intrest in this album because you certainly looked at it and now 21 will be release mid march and now 22 mid july and now 23 will be release mid october you can pre order the next three now albums on wwww.nowthatsmusic.com so if u think they were stoping think again plus the UK has nows and there going to have now 63 in march/april so guess what it proubily going up to 100 so you have a long time before saying they wont make anymore cause they are so NOW music rules AWESOME CD WOOOOOOOOOO
3,06 Tundra Access Cab - decent fit but had to drill,"First off a bought the extend-a-fenders type for my Tundra. The back two fit fine, but the front two needed modifying to get them to properly seat which entailed drilling holes into the lip of the front two fenders. Also I had to go to the Toyota dealership to buy the body clips, they DO NOT come with the fenders. These fenders are a semi-gloss black plastic which isn't quite as thick as I had hoped but seemingly durable. They have the look of the TRD fenders not the OEM or Limited. The front fender is the split design where one portion of the fender stops at the bumper with the smaller piece finishing it off. Hope this helps some of you decide whether to get these or not. They look great on my white truck and matches my tonneu cover well, but not quite the color of the original trim. I think BW could do better on the price for these, a little steep for the work I had to put into it. 1 Hour to put on not including the trip to the Toyota Dealership."
4,"Great, but not complete","Pros: Detailed and eloquent descriptions of every facet of bonsai care for the beginner bonsai enthusiast. Lots of wonderful pictures to illustrate examples.Cons: The book lacked description in such techniques as air layering and creating new branches. Though it did talk about them, these sections were not very clear. But that's just me being picky and a beginner.Other thoughts: I've already read through this book twice and learned so much! The few gaps that the book has can be overlooked, as the information that the book does offer and helpful illustrations are encouraging to the beginner bonsai botanist!"
5,Informative and beautiful,This book is a must for anyone even considering Bonsai. It contains everything you need to know. I would recommend it!
4,Very Comprehensive,I actually bought this book as a gift along with the various items needed in the growning of a bonsai. The book was amazing with beautiful pictures and detailed instructions for growing a bonsai from the underground - up. Great deal for the money. Enjoy!!
3,not quite as good as MAGE HEART and FIRE ANGLES,"i was an avid fan of routley after reading the first two books about Dion Holyhands, but this book (which i waited for with baited breath)was a bit disappointing. Dion, for reasons that are never quite explained, decides to head off to Aramaya to search for her missing niece. instead of concentrating on the magical aspects of what was supposed to be the magical epicenter of Dions world, the book concentrates more on Dions wish to have children, her failed marriage, her current love affair, and her love for her niece whom she hated in the second book. once again, Routley manages to wrap up the entire novel in the last thirty or so pages. This book also ends with unanswered questions, baiting us for another installment for this magical soap opera. quite frankly, i was expecting more."
4,A wonderful unit-worth the money!,"This is an attractive and superior quality cd player for the price. I have the newer version (model EJ-D361) which is the same as this one I see no difference. I am quite pleased with the performance of this unit thus far. It plays very clearly, the bass output is superb, it allows for high volume and the battery life is incredible. Since I purchased the unit 3 weeks ago I have not changed the battery and I use the cd player daily. The only flaw is the anti-skip protection. It has skipped upon numerous occasions when walking briskly however, I am still trying to decipher whether there is real flaw because it could be a wiring problem with my set of headphones. Other than that this is a great unit for daily usage. The headphones are okay but quite big considering there are other smaller more practical ones on the market. If you are looking for a slim, light, inexpensive unit with great sound this SONY unit will more than suffice."
4,Will Last for Years,"I've had this CD player for about 6 years and haven't had problems with it. This CD player will go through the deepest scratches like there isn't even a scratch there. It has great surround sound to give your music a cool effect. It is not sensitive to bumps on the road either, in fact you can hold it sideways and upside down. The only bad thing is that it's a little heavy. I recommend it to people who like simple controls and surround sound."
4,PRETTY GOOD!,"This is a pretty good cd player,it has every thing I wont in a portable cd player.The sound is superb,the bass is just right,the vol. is just high enough, but i noticed that sometimes the button will stick.I had to buy another set of sony headphones,because the wire came loose.But my new ones sound just the same,they are just have a different look and are alot lighter.If you need a cd player I reccomend this second to anyone."
1,Spiritual Otters,"Under the assumption that this book would actually tell me something about river otters, I purchased it. In a condescending and prolix style, the author describes her spiritual journey into Native American beliefs using otters as a vehicle for her exploration.It would be a perfectly lovely gift for a bright child interested in a holistic approach to nature and the world around us."
3,Too pricey for just 3 songs.,"As the first writer said, I too bought this after listening to the first song, ""I trust God"". I myself am going through some things and needed this reassurance, which the song states. The other listings are instrumental, so actually if you count those, there are 6 altogether. The last one ""In the Garden"" left me wanting to hear more."
3,Not exactly,"Not exactly what I was expecting. This is more a book on cigar tricks, not cigar history/culture/etc. Just be aware what you're buying."
2,Louder please!,"This product would get an easy four stars except the quality of the recording is poor. You would think for this kind of money he would at least give you a decent tape. You have to turn it all the way to the max to hear it and if there is any noise going on around you, forget it. So walking down the street listening to the tape is fine as long as there's no traffic. It wasn't just my tape either I have his French tapes and they have the very same problem. His technique keeps your attention, speakers are clear, but the sound quality is so annoying it makes me want to return both sets of tapes!"
1,Beware of this Product,"I received ""All the Spanish You will Ever Need"" today. It comes in a box so titled, and all the tapes have that title on them. The instruction book has that title on it, and the contents of the book are consistent with the title. However, the tapes have French lessons on them. So, I was cramming to learn Spanish fast because of my business, and I learn that on the return policy, I will have to wait a few weeks to get a refund; therefore, I have to lay out money on two products in order to have one. Beware of this product."
2,Truly dreadful battery,"I agree with all the comments at this site. I was actually visiting this site looking for a battery for my phone, and saw all these reviews. I purchased this phone about a year ago, and now, I have to make sure that the cordless is on the charger all the time. Even that's not sufficient if my call lasts more than 30 minutes. And as another reviewer said, it would even discharge by morning if I forget to place it on the charger the night before...I am gonna give it one more try with some other company's battery compatible with this phone. Hopefully it will work if the problem is with the battery and not with the phone."
2,poor panasonic performance,"i too have had battery problems with this phone. but my major complaint is the handset's inability to work properly when other appliances in the home might be on, such as the microwave or clothes dryer - it cuts out like a cell phone might when far away from a tower. love the talking caller ID, though (don't have to put my glasses on to read the display), and the speakerphone and answering machine still work, so i'm using the unit as a desk phone for now."
5,Great phone,I've had this phone for a couple of years and had no problems. I have replaced battery only once. Great phone.
2,Battery is really a problem with this phone.,"Though I think the phone looks and sounds great, and I am pleased with the range, the battery truly dies within a year. It will happen all at once, too, with the first 6 months being great, and slight issues with long calls in the next 3 months, and finally total collapse at the one year mark.Now I am down to charging it all the time, and I only get a 30 minute conversation in (once per day) before the phone dies. This is not a fluke, unfortunately, as I also bought the same Panasonic Phone for my brother, and his died before the one year mark, too. Really a pain, as I've had other cordless phones for years without problems. Do I really have to purchase a $40 battery every YEAR? The answer, of course, is NO. I just need to buy a new phone with a better battery!"
1,Buyer Beware!,"After having great experiences with Panasonic phones, I asked for this specific model for my birthday. Upon making the first calls, I was immediately disappointed. One out of two people asked if I was using a cordless phone; not a good sign. As far as battery life, I agree with the other reviewers that the battery life was poor. I could live with that until one morning while trying to make a call with the handset fully charged, the phone just completely died. I emailed Panasonic who told me that I should send the handset in along with the receipt and they would either fix it or replace it with a ""reconditioned model."" As if...who has a reciept for a gift from six months ago? The same thing happened to my sister with the same phone. Like many of the other reviewers, it turned out to be the battery. It completely died within 6 months. Please take my experience as a warning. Do not buy this phone."
1,Panasonic- ACJ96NKX-TG2257 needs to be recalled!,"I originally initiated a search online looking for a battery because my phone loses the charge after only about 30 minutes and takes at least a day and a half to recharge. I thought that it was just time to replace the battery until I read the other reviews and realized that others were having the same problem that I am having. When I actually stop and think about it, I have been experiencing problems with this phone since I purchased it. When I first purchased the phone, I had a 30 minute conversation and then had to place the phone back on the cradle to recharge and it took about a day and a half! I thought it was because I didn't let it charge completely initially, so I left it on the charger for 3 days without using it and then when I did use it I had the same problem. I think that Panasonic owes everyone who bought this ""phone"" a refund."
1,Battery does not last AT ALL!!!!!,"It seems that everyone agrees that the battery on this phone dies after a 30 minute conversation. This happened to me even when the phone was new, and charged for two days!!!!! I kept thinking it would get better, but it never did. I feel that all of us who bought this phone was SCAMMED by Panasonic!!!There should be a recall!"
2,Battery can't hack it...,"When I first purchased the phone, the battery wouldn't charge. I figured I was just unlucky and got a lemon. I quickly exchanged it for another one which did charge up. However, now after having it for less than a year, the battery dies after only about an hour of talk time, or if I leave it out of the charger overnight.So was I just unlucky enough to get two lemons in a row? Well that question was answered by a friend of mine with the same model phone who says that she has the same problem with her phone. Luckily, I got the extended warranty, so maybe I'll see if I can just get the battery replaced every few months. Needless to say, this is very disappointing, especially after all the great things I've heard about Panasonic phones."
1,6 month battery life 1 hour duration,Don't try to call Panasonic to complainThe battery won't last as long as the time you are on holdMy average cutstomer service call can take 1 1/2 hour and my phone dies midway
3,"For Fischer Games, look elsewhere","As one of the reviews says, this can be a good book for some interested in the life of one of the most famous players of all the time. Although, even in that aspect, it is not entirely satisfying. My interest in Fisher is more in his games. And for his games, I would strongly advise the reader to look elsewhere. The notes and annotations are superficial and not at all helpful. The aim of the book may not be to improve your chess, but Fischer games deserve far better treatment than this one does. I was very disappointed."
3,Food for the chess fan,"The book is not very well written, but still has so much information about Bobby Fischer and provides so much in terms of cross-tables of tournaments and annotated games of the grandmaster that any lover of chess will get enjoyment from it."
3,Looks like a piece of political propaganda,"Even though it was Bobby Fischer the main reason that drove me from a rather normal childhood into a chess-infected existance, I couldn't bear the hysterical overtone that dominates the book. I can assume that even if Bobby himself commended a sel-indulgent biography to Brady, he would reject it immediatly, due to the immensely maniqueist context. It sounds like a long-gone echo of the Cold War. Maybe that's because Dover's policy of publishing unabrideg texts. The games are correctly annotaded, but then you must skip the bio..."
3,"A good biography, but bad game collection","If 10 points will be given to a book, I will give 5 points to the biography part. For the game collection part, I just give 1 point. It's nothing but a printout of a game record. Almost all the games don't have analysis. You can't improve your skill from this book. I suggest the publisher split the book to two parts so that we can just spend 5$ to buy the biography part."
5,Great item!,"Product was described to a ""T"" and the sizing chart was accurate! After researching various types of stirrup fleece pants, vendors, and product reviews, I purchased this item because 1) had a front zipper (in which many do not as well as other pockets), 2) the reviews were mostly 5-star in comparison to others, and 3) the price was reasonable compared to others. These pants are so comfortable that after trying them on he wore them all day as if they were sweats!"
3,Misleading,"The title, ""To Servo and Protect,"" led me to expect that the series premiere, ""To Protect and Servo,"" would be on this tape, and it wasn't: the two episodes seen here are called ""Amp Loves You, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah,"" and ""Lights, Camera, Action."" (They're not *bad* episodes, but if you're looking for the story of how it all started, it's not here.)"
5,"Understanding, not just pretty pictures.","I am enjoying this book a great deal. I enjoy the images we get from Hubble and other sources as much as anyone, but understanding comes from math. Things always seem more clear to me once I understand the equations. BTW my math skills are rudimentary relative to professionals scientists."
4,ho-hum,"I found Honor's Pledge bascially dull and unexciting for the first three-fourths of the book. The author spent a great deal of time developing Abbie and Monte's mutual attraction to each other and not enough time developing their characters. After Monte marries someone else because of his honor's pledge, the book suddenly gets eventful. The last fourth of the book contains all the plot development and excitement, including a murder, a kidnapping, a surprising rescue, encounters with Comanches, a scarlet fever epidemic, and a gold strike. I had originally planned to give the book three stars, but added one just because of the last part of this book. Overall, however, I've read much better Christian historical romances, and I hope that the next in this series will improve on plot and develop the characters more fully."
4,This is a good book to read about honor and love.,Abbie and Monte are wonderful charctors. Abbie is such a adventureous girl and Monte a fine gentleman. I liked Abbie the best because even though she gets into scrapes she trusts God. Keep it up Kristen!
4,Works well and lasts long- Value however is questionable due to pricing,"This works well and lasts long. My review is after years of use so I can attest to its durability. It is EXTREMELY pricey for the value it is purported to deliver. After all it is just a gate made of tubes and welded together. The accesssories are quite basic. Nothing fancy. Just goes to show that in the name of protecting our kids, parents (like myself) with the right hormones coursing thru them will fall for the flimsiest of marketing."
5,Excellent gate system!,My son gets into everything and anything. This gate system is excellent. It allows you to have baby in hand and open/close the gate. It automatically closes so if you have forgetful people in your house you don't have to keep checking. These stand the test of time and lots of use. Totally worth it.
1,No Gate,This did not come with a gate they only come with polls. Now I have to found a way to return it.
1,Caution,"I like DVD-Rams because you can record and erase many times. I record quite a bit and have gone through many DVD's. I bought these because they were cheaper than the panasonic DVD-Rams. Unfortunately the Verbatim DVDs did not last nearly as long as the panasonics. I was only able to record 4 times before the disk failed. I had to cut sections from my recording to save what I had. Maybe this was just a bad disk, but it is not worth it for me to try again."
5,Most effective repellent ever used... Learned after Katrina,Some very thoughtful donor provided a case of Insect Shield following Hurricane Katrina. As a site manager I share the towels with many and found that all exclaimed how well they worked following the storm and the mosquitos that followed. I have since been a fan and have sought a site in which to buy more....
4,Something to look forward to,"As an American female twenty something, why would I want to read about a British middle aged male? The answer is because from Tubby's perspective I can see how the middle of one's life is only the beginning. David Lodge has created a hysterical novel. Yet his in-depth look at what happens when one's life falls apart demonstrates how enjoyable it can be to pick up the pieces."
2,"Cheap, poor quality, will last you 1 year.","This was a cheap one I found on amazon. I bought 3 of them. You have to twist them a bit after plugging them in to avoid the static, then you will have to hope the cable doesn't move or you'll hear static. Then eventually after about a year the plug will come off the cable and you'll see the wires. My recommendation is to spend $5 more and get a better one."
3,Product did not come as pictured,"The picture shows a gold plating on the heads of the cable, but the actual product was not gold plated.The cable is also closer to 5 feet long rather than 6, but this is not really a big deal.However, for the price and free shipping(at least in my area), this still seems like a decent buy."
1,Not really shielded...,"I didn't cut it apart to see, but this cord lets a lot of noise through. I use this in my car and its worst than all other cables I have. I specifically bought this the product because it says shielded in the title.Another thing this cord is only 5ft long! NOT 6ft."
1,Not as advertised!,Not for use with a mic as depicted in the photo. (3-black bands) Arrived as a standard 2-band stereo cable - not what I needed.
1,Not as shown,The cable I received has only 3 poles not 4 as it is shown in the picture. This is completely useless for me.
2,Not as pictured.,"The cable is not the one pictured. The one pictured has gold connectors. The one received does not have gold connectors. Please, get the right picture up!"
2,Good buy for a penny but not the highest quality,"The cable does it's job and carrys sound but thats about it. The product description mentions that this cable is shielded to prevent interference from other electronics, which I find hard to believe. When I turn the speakers up to a reasonable volume I can hear a strong buzzing noise (likely intereference from another electronic). Go for it if youre hooking an iPod up to a car auxilliary jack but if sound quality is important like when hooking a computer up to a tv with surround, dont waste your money on this one."
1,Item not as pictured,"The cable I received did not have 4 poles as depicted, it is a regular 3 pole cable."
1,horrible,Dont buy cheap cord dosent get the job done hated it isnt compatible with mic's like description said smh BAD BUY
1,Disapointment,Disapointed - because of mislabeling of packing led me to believe product was a dozzen (shown in description and weight)
3,"Nice compact book, but nothing special","Solid book with the basics of etiquette for various situations. But I didn't find this book special or with anything that stood out as especially useful. Nevertheless, a nice compact guide."
3,Acceptable taste...not bad for sugar-free,"I bought a 5 pack for $21 including shipping. I do wish I knew which stores sell this directly, I would consider buying this more often that way. It is rather pricey. For $2 a bar, I would much prefer the taste and texture of SimplyLite Dark Chocolate bars sold at Trader Joes. Tasty, rich dark chocolate taste, and 3.5 ounces versus only 1.8 ounces for the ChocoPerfection bar. At $4.20 per bar the ChocoPerfection costs $2.33 per ounce, while the SimplyLite is $0.57 per ounce. ChocoPerfection is 3 times as expensive!But SimplyLite has Malitol. Decisions are difficult to make. Although one is much more expensive, there could be a good reason to pay more especially on a weight loss program."
2,eh,"Has kind of a bland, watery waxy taste - hard to describe, not very chocolatey. If you can't eat anything but SF candy and other sweeteners give you problems, I guess you could try it just to see if the mental satisfaction of eating chocolate outweighs the taste & texture.I thought the dark chocolate with almonds was MUCH better (if you can eat nuts) and don't buy a case of any flavor without trying one. I finally found them at a local health store, then if you love them you can buy in bulk on Amazon."
4,"""This guy doesn't seem to take a hint...""","Though not super-articulate, my boys LOVE Jango. They insist I put up the guns and backpack if they want to bring him outside or in the bath. I've had to order a second one. Jango Fett, biological blueprint of the Republic Clone Army, is another great addition to the Saga Collection."
4,gave as gift,hard to rate since it was a gift for Christmas for grandson. I'm not able to rate this product since it was a gift and wish it didn't require using X amount of words
2,"HOLLOW is Hollow, in all meanings","Ok, everyone else summed a lot of this movie up. Docu-Blair-Witch meets not-so-scary with 4 kids that by the end, you wish you were there hiding behind the tree with a hammer for them too.The total insanity of this 1.5-2 star film is that maybe, just MAYBE, it would be worth watching for a first-time, if you liked the Blair Witch 2, or any other 'on-handheld-cam' type reality documentary found-film movies - but that god-awful $7.99 rental cost! I mean, there are 10,000 other movies that rent cheaper that are better! Let's be for real, this movie is going to be a free line-up item on Netflix or free-to-view with Amazon Premium in 6-months. Sadly, after watching it, I don't see $1 in a week rental for this movie.Run, don't walk, away from this one."
1,Give me back my time please!,"hahahahahhahhaah this movie is EXACTLY like it's name... H-O-L-L-O-W... Oh gosh, this was bad, really bad! Save yourself; don't even think about pushing play. Ha!"
4,Really good independent movie,"I found the movie fresh and with good acting. I was surprised with the director's management of the camera in a found footage film, really well done!!!!If you are in the mood to watch a suspense/horror film, with a pace that gets you involved with the characters, this is a good option."
2,I've never hated 4 fake people so much,"Hollow is a found footage movie with 4 annoying, unlikable people in the middle of nowhere who can't stop messing around with a haunted tree. Despite a great location and a tense ending, the characters are so grating that I wanted to strangle all of them myself by the end. I really wanted to like this, a British take on the found footage genre, but when your characters have to be horrendously stupid for the story to work, then you need to go back to the drawing board. Only for the inhumanly patient and those that like 25-30 good minutes of a 90 minute movie."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....,"Very middle of the road found footage film.What I liked:The story was neat. It was really spooky and had a bit of depth to it.The shooting locations were breathtaking.The actors weren't terrible.What I didn't like:The movie felt really slow. I don't know if they were trying to build tension or suspense but it didn't work for me. I found myself feeling incredibly impatient the entire film and although I expected the ending (since they give it away in the beginning) I really wish that I got to SEE more. It felt like a lot of hysterical people waving a camera around at nothing.That being said, I'm sure some folks will enjoy this film and I'm happy for that. It just wasn't for me."
1,Hollow was horrible.,This was really bad!!! I don't like this personal photo type documentary horror movie. There was to much jumping around.
2,lol its blah,not really scary and not a thriller.maybe i have seen to many but i was able to tell what was going to happen before it did.it is hard to place this movie.some of the story line could had been better and acting as well.the first time i watched it i had to shut it off about 1/3 of the way.i came back a few hours later and watched it the rest of the way.
1,bleh,Obviously a parallel to Blair Witch Project only much much duller. I picked it and everyone in the room was sighing and looking at me like WHY? I'm not picky as a rule concerning horror films but come on! It flat lined through 98% of the film with ending minutes of complete predictability. So boring!
5,Give it a chance!,"I admit the only reason I bought this CD was because I saw it on sale really cheap. I'd only heard of them because of ""Little Black Backpack"" and decided to just go for it and buy it. When I first listened to it I didn't like it so I put it away and didn't give it a chance. I pulled it out months later when I was getting ready to go on a road trip. It's the only CD I listened to the entire time!!! It might take a while for it to grow on you but it's a great CD!! So buy it and just give it a chance!!!"
1,Very Bland,...Being someone who has no emotional connection to this band I find their music bland and unoriginal. They will probably be huge.
1,L-A-M-E,"weak, flash-in-the-pan pop. the person who recommends it to ""punk"" fans obviously wouldn't know punk if it bit him/her (which real punk does)."
1,average overproduced highschool music...,"Where to begin... The whole album is completely over produced, as one track lingers on way past its due time. It would almost pass as sell-out indie rock, but don't get your hopes up. The lyrics,when not completely forced, are immature and fake. It looks like these guys stopped in mid-play to flip through an SAT vocab review book, which would make sense using words that are otherwise uncompatable with their highschool-faux music. This album is easy to hate with it's ""aw shucks,"" mood lurking on every track. If you want to buy a CD based for an average, bland, atypically unintellegent audience, this is your cup of tea. Otherwise skip the chocolate milk juvinille quality of this CD, and move up to a real mature and deep rock CD. Do not fund a further exploited xerox copy of sounds all too reminiscent of 1999-2000 to be released for the next five years. To those who agree, hold on, a breath of fresh air is soon to blow this fluffy fog away."
3,Bland pop-rock,"When I heard ""Little Black Back Pack"" and ""Letters"", I was hooked. Those happen to be some of the better songs on here. This is kind of bland, so I can't keep myself liking it as much as I could. It kind of reminds me of Better Than Ezra (not that that's a bad thing). There is a lot of filler here, and that's evident.However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have its moments. Other than the other two, I also like ""Tail of the Sun"", ""Not Nothin'"", ""One Time"", and ""Tear Me In Two"". Those all have strong points to them. I know that there's mainly an acoustic guitar on ""Tail"", but it doesn't lack much direction. But I love what I've heard from the next Stroke 9 album, so I'm not totally sure what to think of it, though I kind of like it. Enough to not sell it at least. There isn't a whole lot of lyrical subtlety, either, though it is catchy. But if you like that type of thing, then buy it."
3,"Fun, but not exactly inspired","I initially bought this CD for ""Little Black Backpack"", not really knowing what else I would get, but I was hopeful. I had already bought Lit and Blink 182 and had enjoyed both, so I figured Stroke 9 would probably be just as good. Wrong. I was pleased by the tunes that I heard on ""Letters"", ""City Life"" and ""Washin' and Wondering"", but the lyrics were just horrendous. Luke Esterkyn has a great voice; it's a shame he has to waste it on such corny lines. I won't go into any more depth about the CD, because frankly, Nasty Little Thoughts doesn't have much depth either. However, Stroke 9 does have some potential, and if light, poppy tunes is all you crave anyway, this CD will probably be a dream come true."
4,A Pleasure to Listen to,"No, this cd doesn't present us with life altering views of the world. No, it doesn't force us to be better people. I don't know about you, but sometimes I just like music, because it's catchy. Stroke 9 manages this with ease. This is one of those cd's that I can pop in the player, and listen to over and over again. The songs are catchy, and I find myself singing them quite often. This is a fun cd, especially for the summer. The title track, ""Nasty Little Thoughts"", is one of the best songs on the entire album. Give Stroke 9 a chance, before dismissing them. Noone said music had to make you be a deep thinker, personally, I like music that can take my mind off of other things."
5,Coooool!,"This cd is really great. Stroke 9 has great music and vocals. I especially like their songs ""Letters"", ""City Life"", ""Little Black Backpack"", and ""One Time"". All the songs are great to listen to. If you like Third Eye Blind, you might like this."
5,The best!,"This is one of the best cd's ive ever heard, they mix a great beat with great vocals. ""Little Black Backpack"" is a great song."
4,This is music that you feel...,"As powerful as the vocals and lyrics are, it was the guitar that swept me away. I felt that it's sound was very reminiscent of Metallica. It was the guitar intro in ""Little Back Backpack"" that sold me on the album. It's a must have, you won't get regret it."
3,Expected more . . .,"I heard the simply WONDERFUL song ""Little Black Backpack"" on the radio and I was amazed with the potential talent the group had. So, I purchased this CD. I must say I was a little dissapointed by the predictability of the songs. They were practically all alike. Besides ""Little Black Backpack"" and ""Letters,"" the songs are all mediocre. Yes, they are good, but nothing spectacular. Only remotely interesting songs. But I must say the lyrics are souful and emotional. And though this group has a good lead singer, he puts little feeling into the songs. If there was more variety, this CD could have earned itself five stars, but I'm sorry to say that this is all the better I can do so long as the group wants to have all their songs similar to each other."
5,Waiting for a new album,"Gosh, I love this disc. I think I listen to it at work everyday, seems to make me work better. The sound reminds me of a mix of Goo Goo Dolls and Barenaked Ladies. Besides Little Black Backpack, other fantastic songs include, Letters, City Life, Tail of the Sun, Washin + Wonderin, Make It Last, and One Time. I do love all of the songs though. I am ready for a new release by Stroke 9!"
1,WHAT???!!!,"This is totally unoriginal, fast food music with abysmal sub-high school level lyrics. I mean, these lyrics really s[tink]! Very disappointing. Don't waste your bucks unless you want mayonnaise music. Zzzzzzzz."
2,these are my nasty little thoughts,"letters, little black backpack, and washin and wonderin are three of the best pure pop rock songs i've heard in a while, honestly. if the rest of the cd was up to that quality, it'd probably be one of the best and easily the catchiest cd's i own. unfortunately, it's not and the other 9 songs range from merely OK to simply terrible and when only 1/4 of a cd is any good, my friends, that's why the good Lord created Ebay and Kazaa. i'm not gonna spend my time knocking this cd trying to sound all self-important and pretentious and all that, in my mind, simply put, 3 of the songs on stroke 9's cd nasty little thoughts are really really good and the other 9 pretty much suck. they had all the potential in the world to write an album of great pop songs, but they burned out after 3 and released the album with a LOT of filler. and now they're a punk band, so yeah. disappointed, but it won't be in my cd collection for much longer. that's all from me."
3,I haven't listened to the entire cd yet but...,I saw that Target has it for 7.99 so i will get it tommorrow. that guy from england that gave the cd a one star rating and blamed the world's problems on the cd made up my mind to buy it. he's just upset that he has a socialist in charge of his country...not to say that we don't.alan keyes 2000!p.s. little black back pack and letter are good songs.
1,Cheese,over produced pre packaged mindless pop for those who let the record companies tell them what they should like.
5,Stroke 9 is awesome!,"Hey! Stroke 9's CD ""Nasty Little Thoughts"" is the best CD I've ever heard. Every song on the CD, not just the singles, is awesome. My favorite song is on track 8 ""Not Nothin'"" it has great lyrics and the music is breathtaking. Everybody needs to own this CD."
5,All the songs that make you shake will by Stroke 9,"This is by far the best CD I own. They come out rockin' from the start of Letters all the way through Tear me in two. We have tickets to go see them on monday I'm sure they won't dissapoint me. I think my Favorite songs are Letters, Make it Last and Not Nuthin'. Thes guys will definately be around for a long time come."
2,"Well, at least it sounds good...","This is definitely blah music that might be saturating the radio waves soon. Stroke 9 sound talented, and some of the melodies are great, but ultimately the frustrating lyrics and unoriginality prevail, and one is left feeling empty. But, it does rock at times, and they seem to know how to ride the current. Uninspiring, but palatable."
5,Flawless!,"This album is absolutely amazing. You can listen to every track over and over again! This is a must have for any music lover. The standout tracks are ""Little Black Backpack"" and ""Letters."""
4,bumper to bumper PLUS,"I first heard this band in Portland, OR 4 years ago when they were playing small city venues for $20 bucks each and slept in their van when on the road. Their cd ""bumper to bumper"" was a great first cd and included some recordings that are on this ""debut"" cd. They were a good young band then and now, but they seem to have developed a new depth over the past few years that can be found in the newer songs. These kids are educated and have experienced the world in their short time, allowing for their seemingly frivolous lyrics to provoke thought in the listener. Cheers to these boys. They will go far..."
4,A very good cd,"The songs on this cd are all good, but not great. You should buy it if you like ""Little black backpack,"" but don't expect them to sound like Blink 182. That's just not their sound. They aren't punk either. If you want punk buy 'Ignition,' or 'Smash,' by The Offspring. Stroke 9 is really, really good power-pop. Buy it if you like their single, you won't be disappointed."
3,nothing too special,"this is your typical yada yada yada fun fun fun rock album that has trite lyrics and is not meant for the critic who is searching for some symbolism behind the music. i don't know whether to recommend the purchase or not...letters and little black backpack are catchy as anything...i fully admit that...total ear candy...but the rest is...well...yawn. so if you must have these songs then purchase it, but this album definately isn't a package deal."
3,a good cd,"this cd is good, but definetly not the best i have ever heard. the song 'little black backpack' is cool, but like other songs, can play itself out. 'washin and wonderin' and 'tail of the sun', 'letters' and 'city life' are also okay, but there is nothing this cd has to offer that is new and different except 'little black backpack'. stash this next to a blink 182 cd and you're set to go."
4,Stroke This!,Stroke 9 is definetly making a place for itself in my disk changer! I first saw thier music video on MTV and my mouth dropped wide open. The leade singer (Luke) is VERY good looking. And after listening to the song I rushed out to buy the cd. The songs are written with feeling and the instruments are played well with a good melody that isn't just banging guitars but actually has something you can sing along to. Unlike alot of the other rock groups today.
3,This is a mediocre CD.,"This has the awesome song ""Little Black BackPack, and it also has Washin and Wonderin, but the rest of the songs are just mediocre. This is definetly a flash in the pan group. The CD will probably stay popular for another couple of months, but then it will be gone. I do love the song Little Black Back Pack, though."
1,The death of rock music,"Stroke 9 just feeds fuel to the fire of the death of rock music, with it's cheery pop-in-a-can feel, it just prooves the point that big media companies don't know talent if it struck them in the head."
1,easily forgettable,"awful, mindless ""power pop,"" overproduced for the new generation of teens...they are awful live, too.."
3,thin and floppy,"the cardboard packaging states that the hose is 5 ply and heavy duty, but this hose is thin and kinks very easily, especially when it's hot outside."
3,So close...,"I like all the features with this phone, LCD displayed, phonebook and handset speakerphone, Ni-MH battery and etc. but except one... the range is awful when your one floor down - the sounds tends loosen up when your a few feet away from the base, also tried relocating the base but no effect. frankly im very dissapointed, Better stick with your old panasonic 900mhz DSS phone."
1,Echo..Echo...Echo,"thought I finally found a cordless phone that I would be happy with. I tried all the hotshot brands and after a few returns, I settled with a reliable Panasonic. The echo is a huge problem. After a while it gets annoying."
3,Panasonic VE phone,I love all the features on this phone and i thoughtit would be a good phone but i will be returning it because the sound is horrible cannot hear the other person and if you turn it up or use the voice enhancement feature it echoes on both ends of the conversation. I am very dissappointed in this phpone
3,NOT SO HAPPY,I BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR ALL THE FEATURES WHICH I REALLY LIKED ALOT BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE RECEPTION [is weak]. EVEN WITH THE VOICE ENHANCER ON THAT MAKES IT WORSE. PEOPLE SOUND LIKE IN A TUNNEL AND IF YOU TURN THE VOLUME UP SO YOU CAN HEAR THE OTHER PERSON YOU HEAR YOURSELF ECHOING ON YOUR END THE OTHER PERSON SAID THAT IT SOUNDED BAD ON THERE END TO. IF YOU BUY I HOPE YOU HAVE BETTER LUCK. I REALLY LIKED IT FOR ALL ITS FEATURES SO I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.
4,Speedy Shipping,Received book the very next day! (Granted I live in the same state as the shipper).Am impressed with speedy shipping. Book was more used than I thought it would be though. Still was worth the price I paid.
3,JUST OKAY,"This is my first Mary Lynn Baxter book. Actually, I inadvertently bought another one just the other day. Hope it is better than this one. Bottom line. . .it's okay. Not a keeper. I will be sending it off to my mother. The story is fairly interesting but nothing to get excited about. A little slow. If you feel you just have to have this one, buy it used."
2,Not The Usual Expectation,"I have read all of Baxter's books, and usually buy the new one without even reading the back of book. Although this still sounded great. This was a sexual dance. Without all the decisions to go to bed and the the regrets for dong so outweigh the best parts of the book.And even though I consider Janey a great parent, I would not have gone along with some of her parenting skills. But, this will not keep me from buying future books, because Mary Lynn is usually fantastic. I had the feel that she was on a deadline or something and that this book was hurried."
5,Fun and delightful way to learn new languages,These cards are so much fun. The drawings on the cards are so delightful that they make me smile and chuckle as I flip through them and test my vocabulary. They're so small that I can take them anywhere. I think they would appeal to kids and adults.
3,"Super-CHEAP ""Halloween"" rip-off but entertaining anyway!","This movie has a budget of maybe $930, lame-to-amputated acting, and a cheesy 80s-synthesizer soundtrack...but it's fun all the same! This movie even presages ""Scream/Scary Movie"" in a way (teens who've just eaten pizza with sausage [human meat] are watching & commenting on a horror movie on TV; local cops = morons). There's not much gore but there IS some nice direction/camera work and some of the killings are imginative. It's a big-hair, acid-washed-jeans nightmare! For a cheesy/cheap-O rip of ""Halloween"" it's actually amusing in an Ed Wood-y/MST3000 way."
3,This looks very familiar,"I'm being generous by giving this a three star rating because I'm a huge fan of cheesy 80s slasher films. Unless you're the same, this probably won't interest you. This movie is perfect if you want to invite your friends over, drink a few beers and watch something funny. If you were to watch Offerings hoping to be wowed with the horror and violence you'd not only be disappointed, but you'd notice that the director shamelessly makes a blatant rip off of Halloween. Everything from the escape from a mental hospital, and the way the killer walks, all the way up to the climax music is identical to Halloween. Buy this if you like horror films that are funny for all the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a serious slasher to watch, I'd strongly recommend Michele Soavi's Stagefright."
2,"1.75 STARS: No question about it, this is DEFINITELY a Halloween rip-off, and not a good one at that.","""Offerings"" is a rather poor attempt to rip-off the greatest horror movie of all-time in John Carpenter's original classic, ""Halloween"". These people did not even attempt to hide their plagiarism of Carpernter's classic. The acting is not very good at all, and the movie is certainly unoriginal. Even the music is similar to that in ""Halloween"". Obviously, this movie was unable to capture the atmospheric brilliance of ""Halloween"", and is only mildly entertaining as a conventional slasher flick. For a superior attempt to rip-off ""Halloween"", I recommend ""He Knows You're Alone"" which is a good horror flick in its own right with its own charm (even though it borrows extensively from ""Halloween"") and certainly much better than ""Offerings"" at attempting to clone ""Halloween"". Overall, ""Offerings"" comes across as generic and predictable."
2,Halloween rip-off?,"[good things]There really isn't many good things about this film, but it does seem to be either an homage to the Halloween franchise, or just a blantant rip-off.[the bad]It is very low budget, and it shows.The acting is bad, and the plot sucks-- well, it doesn't suck but it is not unique.The score is almost identical to the score of Halloween.Johnny is almost a carbon copy of how Jason Voorhees would be if he morphed with Michael Myers.The kills are nullified, and crappy.The Elmsdale police make the police of Haddonfield and Crystal Lake look like geniuses.[final thoughts]The movie just seems to be a very bad rip-off of Halloween, nothing more, nothing less. The killer is very Michael-esque, but poor at it.The P.O.V.'s shot were very Halloween, and all the way down to the score.The make-up effects also sucked ass.Don't watch this movie unless you have nothing else to do or really like crappy slasher flicks (as I do)."
4,Excellent preparation for toddlers,"My 18 month old daughter and I read this book together several times each day during my last month of pregnancy. For a few weeks it was her favourite story. She loved it and would even make crying baby noises on the appropriate page. I think it helped prepare her for the arrival of her sibling and now she is a wonderful ""big sister"" and aware her brother is ""too little to talk, too little to walk"" etc. My only complaint about this book is the assumption that the baby will be bottle fed rather than breast fed."
4,This book is a great way to get the converation going,"I was well pleased with this book. It's a great way to introduce new things that will come along with a new baby. It covered those things (more of the positive than the negative) that the big sister will face in a very simple and brief way. I know some disagreed with the baby drinking from a bottle instead talking about breastfeeding and other things that they would do differently than what the book laid out. But to me, that's ok. Just talk about the way your family will do things. This book isn't going to be the ONLY way that you will teach your daughter about your growing family. Think of it as a supplement, a way to get the conversation going and the questions asked. And, if you are concerned about some of the less pleasant changes that may come, there are other books that discuss those topics. I plan to look into those kinds of books as I see those issues arise."
4,"Great book, just wish it were larger.","I purchased this book for my daughter who will be 20 months old this spring when baby #2 arrives. I've heard reading books about it helps little kids to better understand what's going to happen. I also purchasedMy New Babywhich I also would recommend. This is a popular book and i can see why. I really like everything about it, the story and the artwork. It would be nice if it were also available as a board book though. When the book arrived I was surprised at it's size, the dimensions are listed I just didn't pay attention to them. I don't know why but I was expecting it to be larger and wish it was, not the length of the book but the size of the books pages."
5,Adorable!,"Got this book for my 3 year old who will be a big sister in a few months, she loved it! It's very well written for that age group and the illustrations are super cute as well. Was very happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it as a gift for other little girls who will be big sisters too. 10 stars if I could!"
3,Good-ish book . . .,"I really like the pictures in this book, and I like that the baby is always referred to in a gender-neutral way. The only problem is that I bought this book for my daughter, who is very young, to help her understand what life will be like with the new baby. There's a page that says ""it's time to change the baby's diaper, it's time for a bottle, too!"" It's not that I don't want my daughter to see a baby with a bottle - but it could easily have been avoided by simply saying the baby was hungry. It seems like an unnecessary complication to people who won't be using bottles. My daughter is going to have to learn that the new baby will be nursing with mommy, and this book didn't help with that at all."
2,No breastfeeding images!! Bottles only for this baby... sadly.,"Overall the book is nice, simple, my daughter really loves reading 'big sister' since 18 months, and it gets the idea across that it is a new special job and lets her see the things that babies do. My MAJOR problem with it is it has not one but TWO pages which talk about the baby drinking milk from a bottle and show pictures of that, which we all know is not how babies are meant to be fed naturally. I wouldn't mind so much if it had the bottle and also showed a picture of mom nursing the baby as well, but there are not even any pictures of mom sitting cuddling and holding the baby, which I think is one really important concept that older siblings need to get, that they are going to have to share mom. I also think it's sad in this day and age that the bottle-feeding culture is still perpetuated by books like this, when we should be teaching our children that nourishing a baby from the breast is the best and right way."
2,"Images of Bottles, Bottle Feeding","If you are a breast-feeding family I must warn you there are pictures of bottles and bottle-feeding in this book. I glued some flowers over the top of one bottle, turning it into a vase and I glued a rattle over the one where the big sister is feeding him, trying to make it look like she was giving him a rattle, not a bottle. Otherwise, a good book."
4,"Sweet book, could be more interesting","I purchased this book as a part of my daughter's ""becoming a big sister"" present. My daughter LOVES to read, and I have to say, this book doesn't hold her attention very well. It's still a cute idea, but I wish I had purchased a different Big Sister book."
5,A Great teaching tool for Big Sister,"A new baby can be very stressful on older children. This book directed at big sisters, is a cute well illustrated story about the positives of being a big sister. There are plenty of statements to discuss with your child that will give them an idea of just how little baby is and what they can do as the big sister to help baby learn. The book discusses the big sister attributes in such a way that big sister can learn just how special they really are!"
4,From a child's point of view,"We are expecting #2 in March and our almost 4 year old loves this book. It is perfect for preparing a toddler or preschooler for the arrival of a new baby because it focuses on the child, from their perspective. It builds their confidence, and gently teaches them how they will be expected to act (""I must ask mommy first"") My only concern is that it shows the baby being bottlefed, and does not mention breastfeeding. For families where bottles will not be used this may be confusing for children. Other than that, I'd highly recomend it!"
3,"Ok, but Not Breastfeeding Friendly!","My pediatrician recommended this book at my daughter's 3 year visit (we're expecting a new baby in a few months). So we went to the library to check it out. It is a good length of book, with the focus on what the older child can do and what makes them special, which I liked.However, the book features the new baby ""needing a bottle"" but there is no mention of breastfeeding.So many baby books make this omission and it annoys me; I'm a SAHM and I breastfeed so all the emphasis on bottlefeeding is only bound to be confusing to my older DD.I liked the Mr. Rogers ""New Baby"" book (probably out of print) because it had a photo of a baby breastfeeding next to a photo of a baby being fed a bottle, with the caption ""how will your baby be fed?"""
3,not breastfeeding friendly,"Guess I should've read the reviews first, but I was very disappointed about the bottle references and pictures of bottles in here. I was planning on giving this to my daughter's friend who will shortly be a big sister, but as a breastfeeding advocate and nursing mommy myself I will definitely be choosing a different book to give! I thought the rest of the book was great though - just wish it was more breastfeeding friendly!"
3,Nice book with one drawback,I bought this book when my son was born for my 2 year old daugther after reading all the good reviews. I like it a lot - except for the bottle feeding reference. As a breastfeeding mom I would have preferred it if the author simply left feeding out. There are plenty of other things that a big sister can do.
1,Could do without the bottle feeding,"Simply doesn't apply to our family, we don't feed babies this way."
4,really cute book,"Bought it for my 2 1/2 year old, she liked the pictures and it has a simple story. Better than other book I've seen."
4,I'm a Big Sister Book,"I read this to my 3 year old grandaughter hours before her new brother arrived. She even remembered parts of it and said ""he can't eat pizza"" when she first saw him."
5,Just What I Was Looking For!,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter LOVES this book - it is exactly what I was looking for to help explain her new role in our family as a big sister. She is so excited about the birth of our baby and is eager to help. The book makes the big sister feel very special and points out all of the things that the big sister can do that babies can't (eating pizza, apples and ice cream, for instance!). We've had this book 3 weeks and every night my daughter has demanded we read it to her - now she has the whole book memorized and reads it to her dolls! I'm so glad I found this one!"
4,Cute book,It's hard to find specific books in the store and I really wanted one for my daughter that would talk about being a big sister. I thought this book was very cute for what it was for.
5,Perfect for the new big sister,"My 23 month old granddaughter is going to have a baby brother in the spring, and this book is a perfect way to let her know what to expect. Here is why I like it.1. The illustrations are well done and the text is nice and simple. She likes having me read this to her. Also, unlike another new baby book that I have, this is gender neutral as to the new baby, and correctly focuses on the big sister.2. The book shows how the new baby will change things, but also reassures the big sister that she will still be important not only to mommy and daddy but also to the new baby.3. The book also reassures the big sister that the family will still have fun, and that she will still be loved. The message is clear that the new baby is not some kind of replacement, but a new family member and playmate that the big sister can look forward to.Bottom line: This is an excellent book to help prepare a little girl for the arrival of a sibling."
5,Most Relatable,"I ordered three ""baby on the way"" books for my two year old and this one is the winner. She already has the book memorized and it really gets her excited about her baby sister coming and focusing on the fact that she is the BIG sister. Great book - highly recommend."
3,good intro book for big sis to be,"This was a good intro book for the big sister to be, but not one of my favorites. This book does not have much to do with introducing Big Sister to her new role or talk about special jobs she might get to help with when the baby is born. The illustrations are cute, but at the end of the book it left me wishing it had more that I could use to talk about how/why the big sister role will be an important addition to the family."
1,no plot..just names,The back cover was more interesting than anything between the covers. This was my first James Brady novel...perhaps I was expecting something else. The reader IS warned that you needed to be familiar with the Hamptons..perhaps that was my problem.
2,I really wanted to like this book.,"Fresh off reading A Hampton's Christmas, I wanted to like Gin Lane. I enjoy James Brady's mixing of the well-known and the fictional and have not found so likeable character as Beecher Stowe IV in a long time. And it is fun to try to place a name on the characters you should know, but their real names aren't being used. This was definitely a step above The House That Ate the Hamptons and its ""credits"" (including Lady Alix's nipple ring) on the inside printer's page. This book lacked the soul of the Hampoton's christmas book, and was a pleasant diversion, but not as good as I had hoped."
1,Like the place- where's the meat?,"For years I've thought that the Hamptons were a plasticized version of Cape Cod. This book is as shallow as the phonys that pony up to go the Hamptons. While I'm an Imus fan, this book fails to capture the enigma that is Imus. He is highly intelligent and generous but profane and egotistical. Cowboy in this book is profane, egotistical, stupid and lacking any redeeming quality. I always thought that a novel had to have a plot. Like trying to find Waldo- where is the plot."
5,ANOTHER WINNER!!,"My 16 month son loves his Zany Zoo. Every night he brings me the book, climbs in my lap and waits for me to read to him. He really loves it when mommy makes the pets move and adds sound effects.I highly recommend this book for young children."
5,Shoe leather resident tourism,"Having moved to New York not long ago, I've been devouring the history and architecture of the city. This book blends the best of both, adding a third party to the mix -- literature. Dividing the city -- mostly Manhattan -- into eight two-hour walking tours, this guidebook offers literary references, beat-gen biographical information, and urban commentary in a useful, insightful style. The book is due an update -- the Gotham Book Mart has moved and several once-vacant lots are no longer undeveloped -- but this book has made for several wonderful walking weekends, and I know I'll retrace my steps in the future."
5,Inspirational,"Educational Documentary of the reality of sports & life. As an immigrant myself, there were many opsticles I had to fight through and overcome, well in this film there's a similar question about life and what your next step should be."
1,Family Tree Maker 2008,"I purchased Family Tree Maker 2008 (FTM 08) directly from the Generations Network in Orem, Utah, to replace Family Tree Maker 2005. It sucks. While running, all other operations on my computer are slowed to a lurching crawl. FTM 08 itself operates at a snails pace, in sharp contrast to FTM 05 which was speedy.FTM 08 refuses to produce a printed descendant-based report of my family history, grinding on and on for nearly ten minutes and then producing only a blank screen.FTM 05 had a wonderful feature called Book, which would allow you to produce your own book, complete with chapters, inserts, narratives, and pages set aside for photos, as well as an ALL NAME INDEX. This feature has been removed from FTM 08.FTM 08 does allow you to review all of your place names to check for inconsistencies; however, it is otherwise WITHOUT VALUE."
4,Family Tree Maker Version 16 Deluxe,Its a easy way to build and share your family tree. To preserve family history
2,Family Tree Maker,I recieved this product in good time from Amazon but the product itself is giving me trouble I registed it and it won't let me into ancestry >com and I am suppose to have 90 free days and my days are going by and I can't get in. No matter what I do.
3,Wish they gave instructions.,"Without an instruction manual, doing more than the obvious is pretty difficult. Entering family information is very easy -- but figuring out how to make reports, or create a gedcom to post online, or use the citation features is definitely not. Also, there is are links to ancestry -- but unless you logout after each individual use, Ancestry cuts you off for a 1/2 hour. (Seems like you should be able to at least look at everything on a list, rather than each entry, before being cut off.) Some things don't work as advertised -- fastfields (completes a place entry without your having to type the whole thing) is very nice in the areas where it works, but would be nice if it worked, for example, in entering cemetery information. I wish this were more user friendly or came with an instruction manual. It is probably very good software, but who would know without guidance? Not me."
4,Family Tree Maker,Well put together; still lacking some bells and whistles; navigation could be a bit simpler; over all still a fantastic tool for doing genealogy research.
2,garbled to say the least,The question Pates asks is a worthwhile one - how can the drunks on the street feel no shame?It wasn't worth the effort to read this book to get his partial answer.This book needed a more heavy-handed editor than it had.
4,Captivating,"This story will have you turning the pages... You want to find out who is Rufus and why is Rufus the way he is. It also takes you to a time where vacations were for work and for relaxation. If you haven't read anything by: Alexs D. Pate, then I suggest start here. This author needs to be promoted more, has a keen eyesight and will have you believing that you are in Rehoboth."
4,Bow Hunting,"This was my first season of bow hunting in the New York area. My wife bought me Trimble Outdoors Adventure Planner for my Garmin eTrex and it worked like a dream. By using the Aerial photos on the Adventure Planner I was able to identify potential locations for my tree stand. The ruler function also gave me the advantage of determining shot distance to watering holes. I loaded all these waypoints to my eTrex, which made for a much easier trip. -Trimble Outdoors definitely does everything it says it does and more. --Westchester, NY"
3,Just OK,"I am a big fan of Tony Horwitz's work. Confederates in the Attic may be one of my all time favorite books. Having said that, I would not recommend this book. He did not write this book, and that is clear from the first page! This book is really quite dry. It reads like a textbook, but without the depth."
3,Also Disappointed...,"The intro was the best part of this book. It has some decent stories about explorers and characters...i.e. the box car jumper...but the writing is not nearly the caliber that Mr. Horowitz puts together. (Loved Confederates in the Attic...)It is a compilation of other's modest works and disappointing. I was glad it was a library book and not purchased.If you like exploring stories, try Candice Millard's River of Doubt or Over the Edge of the World by Laurence Bergreen. River of Doubt is about T. Roosevelt's last great adventure. Over the Edge of the World is about Magellean's voyage. links below.The River of Doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's Darkest JourneyOver the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe (P.S.)"
2,Not so pleased,"For starters the octopus only has seven arms. The arm pointing straight down is very pointy and really hurts. Within the first week of wearing it one of the rhinestones came off and the octopus started to become discolored. It's a cool idea, but not a good product."
1,people say HALO is overrated.....,"This game is awful. Sure, the graphics are amazing,but they are also great in gears and halo. This gamegot such a hype, AND FOR WHAT??????? The story lineat first is great, but repetitive later. I heardthis game was first announced 3 years ago.....whata waste of time. Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony; PLEASEDROP THE ANNOYING ANIME/RPG ****!!!!!! BRING BACKFPS AND THE SUPERIOR HACK-N-SLASH."
5,My Favorite video game,"I've played this game 4 times, I find myself missing Rapture from time to time (the setting where this game takes place). This is absolutely my favorite video game. I'm not the best reviewer but I would highly recommend this game. It's creepy, it's fun, it's challenging. Great story. Awesome game overall."
5,"Freaky Tales, Freaky Fun","This was a trippy game through and through. It is no doubt a game that has its disturbing moments. I have heard of all the other great series on Xbox, but this one slipped by me. I guess you have to be intrigued by this sort of game to consider it great. The atmosphere was unlike any game I have played. The storyline was well told and laid out. The style of the game was very creepy and unique. Being able to upgrade weapons and plasmids made for interesting battles. There was a variety of ways to defeat your enemies. The levels were beautiful and eerie at the same time. I really appreciated all the save points in this game. I also liked the hint system when you were stumped on what to do or where to go next. I don't think I haven't flinched this much playing a game since Manhunt 1! Some enemies will come out of nowhere because they are blended so well in the detailed yet twisted scenery. I think I will give Bioshock 2 a shot!"
4,Bio Shock,This game is everything it was said to be. The only thing I dont like about it is the enemies. They dont change throughout the entire game. You fight the same enemies in the first level as you do in the last. So the replay value is way down IMO. But still one of the best FPS I have played in years.
5,A new classic.,This game is the best Xbox 360 game so far. In every aspect its determined to become a new classic in the gaming industry.
5,BUY IT!!!,"Being a Halo, Gears of War fan, I was a little skeptical when my friends told me to buy Bioshock, it was a little blah at the beginning but before you know it you're hooked. It's scary, I've had the game for a year and I play it more than I play Gears and Halo... Its surprisingly enjoyable."
4,Bioshock,"K well I'm not much for action adventure games but I was only 15 bucks so I figured what the hell. I was reading in XBox magazine that Bioshock 2 was awsome so before I played 2 I figured I'd play the origanal. My roomate has a 72"" Plasma t.v. and thats what I played it on. Like I said I'm not really into action adv games. Usally just into GTA and Need for speed and stuff like that. Good story and great graphics. I suck at the game but I still have fun with it..... and thats all I can really say for right now because I havent played it that much yet. For the price, you cant go wrong."
5,"Most original game of its time, STUNNING","They broke the mold with this game and everything else seems like a clone of something else. Truly original game play and style. I kept feeling like I was playing a movie. So original and fun to play. I had friends who wanted to just sit and watch me play, its that F'N Good!"
5,Terrific shooter game that delivers,"Bioshock is one of the only shooter games that plays great, makes sense, and has a terrific twist at the end. The story of the game is thoughtful and interesting. Bioshock plays better than most because one can interact or control the environment around them. The one negative some might not like is the background music is old school on some levels and it is not multiplayer. Other than that, it is a great game to play for gamers looking for that knock out first person shooter game.."
5,game of the year,"This mind-blowing game is a thinking person's hybrid shooter and one of the greatest I've ever played. It has a deep, compelling, and unique story that I didn't want to end. I love the retro atmosphere and the graphics are amazing. There's lots of things to do within the lengthy timespan of the game so if you like finding things you'll be in heaven with Bioshock. My few complaints are that it's hard to aim effectively and difficult to use cover but this isn't a game where those things are really important. Also, one ending is much better than other (save the girls)."
5,A MUST HAVE!!!,If you are getting tired of gears of war this is the game to get. The graphics are amazing and the Biopowers are cool. This game Got a 9.7 rating on IGN I believe that is the highest rated game on the Xbox 360 so far I could be wrong. It deserves the rating. If you down load the demo and like it you will be buying it..
5,Bioshock is crazy,I'm not gonna go into detailThe game is an instant classic.It is an must buy for 360 owners !!!!nuff said
2,Boring and Tedious,"This game plays very well. There were no problems even though I bought it used. I am not a fan of the game it self though, I play a lot of similar games (Dead space, Fallout series, Mass Effect series and many sandbox rpg action games). But this one never peaked my interest. The story was VERY boring and the controls left A LOT to be desired. Being forced to stay in 1st person shooter mode gave me headache after while and didn't allow me to play the game for long stretches of time. The achievements were also kind of tedious and didn't increase my enjoyment of the game. Unlike most games I didn't care how it ended and I really just wanted it to be over as quickly as possible. I wouldn't recommend the game."
4,"AMAZING Game, but limited.","This game is incredible. It has perfect dynamics, incredible graphics, offers a new style of game play, and revolutionizes the way game designers design an interactive first person shooter. The game is one that leaves you wanting more as you are at the edge of your seat from the compelling story line.The only problem is that once the game is over, there is nothing left to do but start over at the beginning, as though nothing happened.Although the limited end to a very complex game is disappointed, this is a game I would gladly pay $60 for."
5,Bioshock is not just a FPS,I bought this game for my son who mostly plays FRP games and isn't so much into the FPS genre (that's for Dad ;^) He absolutely loved it. From the look and atmosphere of the game to the intricate story he said it truly lived up to the hype of being one of those games that only comes along once-in-awhile.
4,Good game,I give this game a 4.5 because it has no online play which would of been nice. The Single player is awesome tho. It has a few good guns like the Tommy Gun and the rocket launcher. You can also use big daddy's to kill other enemies also with your powers. The best thing to do in the game is just to save all of the little sisters and you will be rewarded more in the long run.
4,love it no homo,well i thought the game play on it was a 16 star but the hacking stuff was kinda stupid but i dont like how they tell u the storie with the tape recorders
3,Don't Believe The Hype!,This game was promoted as being totally wonderful and super cool...Overall it was a bit of a letdown.One of the main problems is that you are not able to play as the monster!Fix that...and Bioshock will be tough to beat!
2,Doesn't Measure up to the Hype..disappointed,"My husband and I are gamers and love great games..played many..and this one, oddly, since there is so much about it that would make you think it is great..and it is not. We tried to figure this out, but the one thing we came up with is regardless of the reviews, it was awful. Repetitive, if you like that, buy this game. It was a surprising disappointment..considering all the reviews...didnt make sense. Oblivion, ran true to reviews, even older ones like Morrowind...and many others. Bioshock, no way. Despite trying to even go along with some of the reviews about it being fantastic, we just can't. It just didn't win us over at all."
2,Good Graphics Doesn't Always Mean Good Game,"When I saw how many people took the time to write a review I had to find out for myself. When the game finally found its way from the rental place into my Xbox 360 the first thing I realized was the graphics, so I was intrigued. Then the game started getting annoying and began to feel like a chore to play. Maybe I'm being naive about the whole thing but I just cant see myself playing this game any longer. It could be worth giving it a try but for the sake of your sanity I would suggest passing this one up."
3,Locked up at first major achievement,"To succeed in this game, you have to collect ""Adam"". You get this from little zombie looking girls. The first time I encountered one of these little girls, was given the choice to take all her ""Adam"", which kills her. Or, take part of her ""Adam"", which frees her. Chose the second alternative and the game then locked up. The little girl started running in place and I couldn't move in any direction either. Saved the game and then restarted it.......which resulted in me being back at the entrance to the Medical Center and having to redo a bunch of tasks to even get back to where I could save the little girl again. Disgusting....."
2,Good game play...but disturbing story line.,I played the game for like an hour and had to turn it off. The story line was a little too gruesome and disturbing for my taste.
4,Nice graphics,"Well, Is not a bad game, but I wouldn't call it the best, call of duty 4 or gear of war are more of my election! i had great expectatives and it kind of disappoint me.... Well, the graphics are great, the game is bloody enough and kind of scare u (in a fun cool way) but the gameplay isn't that good, the enemies and the scenarios are pretty similar, the enemies aren't that cool, the guns aren't good neither, the powers i can't complain..."
5,Wow.... just wow,"I haven't played a game this exciting since the original Half Life. I sit there paranoid about something jumping out from around the corner the entire time I am playing, you get so emersed in this game.The graphics are absolutely beautiful, the game play is phenominal. The AI is AMAZING! Lighting someone on fire and watching them run and dive into water to put out the flames is awesome. Also the shocked look on their faces when you pull a gun or weapon out of their hand using telekinesis is so cool.This game is a must have for any FPS fan."
1,What a waste,"All the hype for this game was undeserved. The graphics of this are nothing special, and the gameplay itself shames the FPS genre. The entire time I'm playing this game, I feel like I'm in a Tim Burton rip-off. How this game is so popular, and why its getting a sequel I don't know. But if there is anyone on the fence about this game, save your cash for something else..."
1,Too difficult for part time gamers,"This is written by a part time gamer who simply likes to enjoy a game. I find most games are far too difficult for the part time gamer even on the easy setting. All games should have a ""Very Easy"" option. I suspect that there are many others like me who would buy more games if they were not so difficult.I thought the rest of the game was great. Because this was frustrating rather than fun I give it a 1 star. I wish I would not have bought it to pay for being frustrated."
5,Best game I have ever played,"I don't play A LOT of video games, but I got a 360 a few months ago (I previously owned a PS2, PS1, and N64) and got BioShock the day it came out. It is without a doubt the best game I have EVER played. Gears of War and Max Payne are up there, but BioShock is so creative and awesome. If you own a 360, this is a must. Even if you don't, you can always buy one. It's a fun game while it's challenging, but not too hard to the point where it's extremely frusterating.This is truly a one-and-only game."
5,Closest thing to Metroid you can get on Xbox.,"This is a thinking persons first person shooter. With out a little forethought this game will eat you alive. Do everything right and you'll be slicing through the opposition...or bashing, if you prefer bludguning enemies with a wrench. With a story to rival everything in hollywood and better than many books as well.If you have any knowledge (but it is not required) of Ayn Rand's philosophy you'll love the many references to her work. If you're a fan of her's you probably will not like the fact that the entire game is a refutation of her system of beliefs--complete with examples of why Objectivism can never work.Great controls, even better weapons and powers with graphics to die for."
4,Great Game,"I liked this game a lot. It has atmosphere, a good interface, and a story line that keeps you going. It can be addictive. As a dad of two teens, I usually don't play much. More often I tell my sons to get off the computer and do their homework. Number one son, who is a gamer, insisted that I try this one, and he was right. Although I am not good at first person shooters, with his advice I was able to stay alive. It is a very well done game. My son finished the game in a few days, but still rated it ""pretty good,"" which actually means very good."
4,Better than Halo 3,"I found this game to be much more of a most own title for the 360 than Halo 3. The graphics were better, the story was better and the gameplay was better. While the game overall didn't last as long as I would have liked the other aspects of the game made up for that."
4,Should be 4.9 out of 5,"This game was everything that I expected and more! The physics and environment detail were amazing. I only gave it 4 stars because in all honesty I think they could've spent a little more time on the storyline. I felt that this game was way too short for the open canvas it painted in the world of ""Rapture"". Also, there was little effort put into the blood animation comming from the enemies, it has a ""House of the Dead"" style to it. Beautful game in my opinion!"
5,Really creepy and fun,"This is a really fun and unique game. It has a great mix of retro-futuristic sights and sounds crossed with lots of nightmarish imagery and scenarios. It's not scary like a Resident Evil or Silent Hill game, but it still has plenty of creep factor."
5,"For $30, Its a steal !!","This game has amazing graphics and a very interesting, creative and different (not what I'm used to) story line but I gotta say its not for the faint of heart. The graphics are so good that the creepiness of the game is a step above what its suppose to be. Still, its definitely a gamers must have and for 30 dollars...just buy it! I Loved it!"
5,Best..........game............ever (in my opinion),"One day, way back, I'm going through a Blockbuster store with a movie and a game in one hand, and the money in the other. The cashier then recommends about this game called Bioshock, and stupidly i asked' ""what is it."" He tells me the background of the game, then i ask' ""do u have a copy?"" Luckily, he did, so he switched my game with Bioshock and let the M rating thing pass. As soon as i get home, i open the game case and pop in the game to my faithful 360, then the titles appear and i hit new game, but for some reason, i put the brightness all the way up, and after the part when u arrive on the sub, i had no idea where that splicer went. I was somewhat scared, but also fascinated in the interior of the city of rapture. Later on, I didn't think of this game as scary, rather.....fun, really. I thought it was a good $8 rental and 5 days later i bought it, and I was, and still am searching the depths of rapture. Can't wait for B2. :)"
5,Best game I've ever played,I've been playing video games for a loooong time. Bioshock is my favorite. The other reviews do a fine job of explaining the game but my advice is just buy it and start playing without letting any reviews spoil the story.
2,NO REPLAY VALUE!!!,"I beat it in one week only playing it averagly. I mean it was fun...but when you beat it what then? I got none of my powers back and none of my upgrades back. I see 10 out of 10 in what i think was Game Informer (not sure) and I know now never trust the magazines. Always go by the the number one basic rule of gaming try it before you buy it. Next time before I buy any game with great reviews i'm head'n to Blockbuster, what about you?"
2,Nothing good about it.,"I started playing this game on HARD and I went on killing ppl like if I was playing Easy on Halo. The game has good lightning but that's all I can say about it, the storyline makes no absolute sense and you need to look for voice records to get what is going on. When you die you come back to life with everything you had and not that far from where you left off. There is no ""Gam Over"" rubbing your lose in your face, the game is soo easy that I got bored of it. I am not buying the 2nd one, I had to buy it to realize I mis-used my money. So If you need to buy it to see how stupid this game is go ahead it's worth it especially if your are SUPER NEW to FPS, but if you are an experienced FPS player then save your money for Halo 4, Crysis 3, Death Pace 3 or any other game."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I hate to say it, because I was so excited, but this game is pretty boring. The premise is really cool and the visuals are neat, but it bores the hell out of me."
5,Polished game,"This game brings great play action, and combines it with a fantastic art-deco themed environment. A combo that is visually great.....but spectacular in hi-def! Worth the retail price."
5,Everything i love in a video game,"smart, unsettling, shocking, gritty, conceptual, atmospheric. 2K Games is THE BEST! (btw, i know i'm late and Bioshock 3 is about to come out but still this game is right on time)!the seller go the game to me in 2 days! WHAT!? i am impressed."
5,Stunning,"Bioshock is a gem among gems. The XBox 360 has a slew of awesome games, but I found Bioshock to really reach a new level in gameplay, atmosphere and graphics.I recommend playing it on a big screen TV in HD (if you have access to one, of course!), with the lights off. You'll be glad you did.PROS: Engaging gameplay, stunning graphics, and an atmosphere that really sucks you in deep.CONS: I can't play it when my kids are in the area.OVERALL: Probably the best single player game I've played on any platform."
5,BioShocking!!!,"If only all games could be half as good as it is Bioshock! Everything in this game is so beautifully constructed to make your gaming experience so unique and like any other. BioShock has it all...graphics, sound, weapons and oh my ..the story is the probably the main reason why I picked my copy the same day it came out. This proves why games that have a plot and a story that keeps everything together, are such a success. I mean, take a look at Gears of War, Halo or GTA, all those games have amazing stories that are like the glue that keeps everything flowing so smoothly; with BioShock the developers took it even higher to a whole new level. They created a game so interesting that it makes me want to play it over and over again. This is perfection at its best!"
5,Unbelievable,"The FPS genre has become so played out and sterile. BioShock is the breath of fresh air I had been waiting for. It easily tops Halo (not a small task) as well as Gears of War. I just can't get over how great this game is!The story is so engrossing and the characters are magnificent. The 1940's retro sci fi aspect were so refreshing and the story wouldn't let me put the game down. I played this for a week and devoted some serious time to beating it. The graphics and sound make for a spooky surreal world that will have you playing with the lights on.The weapons selection and controls are fantastic. I love the myriad of special abilities that can be unlocked such as telekinesis where you can actually hurl the body of someone you've just dispatched at another attacker or catch grenades in the air and send them back at the thrower. Fire, ice, insects all at your fingertips in addition to the standard firearms and grenade launchers. You have to see this to believe it!"
5,A BADLY NEEDED BREATH OF FRESH AIR!,"I have been a hardcore gamer for at least 10 years and have played many a game, especially shooters. The genre has grown pretty stale, with the same concepts rehashed over and over, albeit with prettier graphics. The last really creative shooter was Deus Ex, which blended the FPS and RPG worlds. Bioshock is it's spiritual successor, really merging the two genres in a wholly unique setting. One pro review I read said calling it a game is an understatement - I agree. It is so much more because of the story, the stunning voice acting, and the underwater setting circa 1946. So much incredible detail has gone into every main area - graphics, acting, story, gameplay - I have been pretty much blown away, and I was close to just finding a new hobby. I highly recommend this game."
5,Delightfully Creepy.,"Being a FPS (first person shooter) fan, this is a refreshing break from the norm: quite literally. It's a twisted world perspective and I loved (and am loving) every minute of it. To the makers of the movie, ""Hostel"", eat your heart out (pun intended). Tap into your dark side and join the citizens of Rapture, the setting of the game, in an epic adventure that is sure to satisfy the beast in you. Weapon upgrades, mystical powers, disturbing clown music and deranged psychos; who could ask for more? This is a must-have and is perfect for any gamers arsenal."
5,Bioshock is the greatest!!,"I've had people tell me that bioshock sucks compared to Fallout 3 and other games like that, but I disagree. Bioshock's first person shooter experience was intense while fighting big daddies or the creepy spider splicers who you see a lot of. Towards th end, the game started to get a bit confusing but it eventually worked itself out. My favorite character was the elite bouncer bid daddy. Just the way it's diver suit works and looks, it's creative and awsome! I can't wait to buy Bioshock 2 and bioshock infinite!"
5,Nice until it broke,It was a great game until my xbox scratched it and make it unplayable. Pick it up used for cheap or On demand from Xbox live!
3,Very Good,"This a very good job in games, all the enviroment and the characters are very worked, to create a great history where you are a fundamental piece. Some users can not appreciate this and think this game is no good or can say that it have a slow history development."
5,just great,"Its the kind of game that you can end or play in diferent ways depending on your likes of the plasmid, guns or abilities in general. plus it has really nice new tricks."
2,Boucheron perfume,"I have worn Boucheron Initial for years on and off. This is the only perfume of mine that got constant compliments, I loved it. After they stopped selling it at Macy's I was heartbroken. I finally tried it online and I think the bottle I received was old, you just don't know how long they've been sitting in a warehouse. The scent was not good, so unfortunately I had to pitch it. If I find it in the store again, I will buy it....it's a lovely scent."
5,"Surprise, surrise, surprise....it has vocals!","This album features the beautiful piano of CHARLIE SHAFFER, plus the Velvet Voice of DON CHERRY. It is not listed here, showing that it is a vocal..but it is. Don sings well with Charlie at the piano, and they often appear in Vegas and on the road where they share the spotlight and the billing. All tunes are great, and a fine performance was turned in by each of them. If you like Don Cherry you will love this album. If you love Charlie Shaffer you will like this album."
2,Not worth the money.,"Before embarking on a 2 month trip to Italy a friend let me borrow Rick Steves' guide and said that it was better. I was skeptical but took the book anyway figuring it might come in handy on such a long trip. She was right. Rick Steves organizes information in a much clearer and more intuitive way, which comes in handy after about the 5th time you get gyped and you just want someone to tell you where you can find a good deal. Flipping through Lonely Planet you might think you've been handed a manual on how to overhaul an engine - it's overloaded with information and poorly organized. Rick Steves' book on the other hand is a breath of fresh air or, to put it more tritely, a helping hand. Not to mention that his guides have personality. After some time you get the sense that he's there with you, helping you along."
5,How does one travel without Lonely Planet?,"Lonely Planet: Italy is, like all the Lonely Planet travel guides, an accurate; detailed pocket guide that one should never travel without. One might baulk at the price but when considering the cost of travel, anyone buying this book is sure to make this up even before leaving home.What makes it good? It's all in one book, places to eat; see and stay. Having graduated from the back-packing guides of yester-year when we trudged around gripping torn out pages from the massive ""Let's Go"" guides, Lonely Planet takes it up a notch and caters for everyone from the budget tourist to those who can afford to indulge a little.Excellent, well done Lonely Planet."
5,Very helpful guide,"Helped me a lot plan the details of my stay in south oh Italy. I travelled by car, and needed a guid that could help me get the most of a five day stay. I used it in my iPad and worked great."
1,Confusing and Useless,"I have typically had good luck with Lonely Planet guides during my travels in Europe, but this one was exceptionally useless. It was very not user-friendly. It used only the native Italian names and words to describe cities and landmarks which was confusing if you aren't fluent in Italian. Many of the hostels that were listed in the guidebook were non-existent or out of business. This book was simply not helpful. If you do choose to go to Italy, buy a different guidebook."
1,Dissappointing,"After many years of using lonely planet guides, I was very dissappointed to find that this guide was one of the worst guide books i've ever used. We found that the authors consistently missed the mark when describing cities and sights (with some of the sights it was as if they had never bothered to actually go there). The restaurant and lodging recommendations were completely uninspired."
2,Don't rely on this country guide--buy the city guides instead!,"My friend bought this guide for our trip through Italy this summer. Our trip went through Venice, Florence and Rome, with side trips into Tuscany and Naples/Pompeii. This book contains information on so many different places that it does not provide much useful information on any one city. We felt so lost in Venice and Florence with the scant information provided in this book that we ended up buying the LP Rome City Guide when we got to Rome. You would be much better off buying individual city guides before you leave the US though because travel books are very expensive once you're in the city. I have used many LP books over the years for both domestic and international travel, but I would recommend city books from now on."
2,Too Heavy,"This is not a travel guide. A travel guide is something that you take with you when you travel to help you figure out what you are doing.I had my lonely planet. My wife had her small Japanese guide. We stopped carrying mine after a while.Lonely planet has lots of good historical and cultural information that you can study on the plane or at home before you leave, but it is way to big and heavy to carry around.Also, it is not very comprehensive regarding restaurants and hotels. How much did these places pay to be listed and to have their competetors left out? There are hundreds of hotels and restaurants in Rome (for example) but only a fraction are listed. We got much better information for free on the Net.There are lots of guides that only have the tourist information you need to have on you. This book is good for the heavy reading only."
3,Info on Italy,"I thought will more infomative, has a lot of info,but you need choices in places to stay, to eat, I find myself buying another book which inform me about my husband passport; was going to expire a month after we come back from our trip, didnt say anything about it(I thought the passport will be fine until we come back from the trip). With the other book (Lets go) right away it tell you; people who passport will expired in the next six month before your trip can not enter the country. Didnt find the book clear,easy or friendly to find the info need it.I think is more for people that has money, not for regular people who travel with a backpack and enjoys good stuff to treat ourself."
5,Lonely Planet Italy,My daughter found it quite helpful in planning her trip to Italy. It helped her choose which cities to see while there.
5,Looking forward to my trip!,"I haven't had a chance to put this book to use yet. The book however has been a very interesting read, and it is very thorough. It has helped to plan out my itinerary and given some great input for knowing what to add and what to subtract. The pictures and descriptions are great. The book is pretty thick, so I'm not sure that I'll carry it around with me, I'll probably end up copying what I need for each day.I have used a number of other Lonely Planet books, namely for Scandinavia and Japan, both of which were great, and very accurate. I am sure this book will be no different."
1,do not buy,"I have had good luck with lonely planet guides in the past, so despite the reviews I bought it anyways. It was useless as a guide on our recent trip - no restaurant reviews, no local sight listings/reviews. Everyone in our group used Rick Steve's to great asset, and that is what I will do next time. This kindle version was very generic. I downloaded the sample and expected the more detailed info would be part of the full version but it was actually very difficult to tell the difference between the sample and the full book. Not good as a 'on the trip' resource."
3,not great,"This book doesn't give many tips or insider information. I rather have more of this and less history, the history you can learn from many other sources, what you really need when traveling is help getting to places, recommendations on how to go about site seeing, etc.For such a big book I found the useful information to be very little.Example: this book didn't mention how the vatican museum is far from saint peter's basilica, or how there are 2 lines, one for regular people and a different (that moves faster) for tours, or how tour companies offer tours right there at the line, some companies offer night tours, how these tours work, etc.The maps aren't great, and some stuff mentioned in the book is not on the maps.it seems to me like lonely planet got lazy and it's relying on its good name. I also got a Rick Steves guide for the Amalfi Coast/Naples and found it a lot more helpful that this one."
1,lonely planet has gone down hill,"In the last few months we've tried to use lonely planet guides for hotels (in costa rica and Italy). we have found the suggestions and reviews useless if not misleading. we did better to consult Fromer's--and we are budget travellers. LP are also less useful as guides to the city (e.g. Rome, Florence...). Very disappointing."
5,Great Guide - Full of Good Information!,This book tells you everything you need to know about Italy. Anyone who is planning to visit Italy should read this before they go. It is full of good information and will help you to get the most from your trip.
2,Better books are available,We visited about eleven cities in northern and central Italy and we carried both the Lonely Planet Italy and the Rough Guide Italy with us. I had the Rough Guide Italy and had no problems looking up information. My companion had the Lonely Planet Italy and she eventually gave up on it. She found the LP to be lacking in basic information and basically a book better left at home. We would recommend the Rough Guide instead.
4,Love it Cheap,"Lonely Planet Italy (3rd Edition) is definitely the book to get for a tight budget tour of Italy. I went on a round trip tour, starting from Milan, to Verona, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Pisa, Beaches on the West Coast and back Milan, simply based on the book. <grin> And the most interesting part got to be that I spend a total of not more than 300, having visited most of the places featured in Lonely Planet <Big GRIN>. The advices on safety given in the book might be a little over the top, but back to think of it, it's worth the precautions.... <smile> Love it Cheap."
5,Lonely Planet does it again,"Lonely Planet guides are the de facto authority on travel guides. They give you a wide range of options in a well tested format. Their travel researchers are top notch and it is very competitive to write for them.The lonely planet guides are the best (with the older footprint guides - a close second - but out of date now). I have used LP guides in egypt, cambodia, all through europe, china and india and they have always been great starting points. This Italy guide is no exception. The perfect balance of solid information coupled with enough history and politics to make you an informed traveler make LP guides the leader in travel guides.I leave home without my Amex card, but not without my lonley planet guide."
5,Lonely Planet delivers another solid guide,"I tend to provide a more concise guide, but this entry into the Travel market, for Italy, is filled with interesting details, ""how to's"", and tip and tricks. It is not a ""shortcut"" guide, and readers seeking a concise, ""take it with you"" map/outline format will be slightly disappointed. However, Lonely Planet has always catered to niche audiences, and as we plan to visit Italy, this guide was certainly very comprehensive, and current."
5,Fantastic book,"As per usual the lonely plant guide to Italy is great. As we were not sure where we were going to go in Italy, this book gave us the inspiration to go to Milan and Rome."
4,"Generally a good guide, a little out of date.","This guide was generally good for the major cities that I visited: Venice, Florence, Rome. It was a little scant however on the smaller Tuscan villages: Regello, Cascia etc. In addition, perhaps it's due to the fast turnover of Italian restaurants and the ever-dynamic culture, but I found that the guide was out of date in some regards, especially concerning restaurants. Especially in Venice! There were a few places that we really wanted to try that were no where to be found!"
2,Very mediocre... order Rick Steve's instead!,"I've used Lonely Planet guidebooks for many of our trips (Costa Rica, Guatemala, Belize, France, Morocco, Thailand...), and this one was a huge disappointment. It has reasonable coverage for the main tourist attractions, but if you have any desire to do anything slightly off the main tourist paths, forget about it. In any case, I thought that Rick Steve's targeted books (Tuscany, Venice, etc.) were so much better. Don't waste your $$ here."
1,This mattress stinks,"The mattress only inflates on it's own around 100'Farenheit. In addition, after only sleeping on them three times the buttons popped and now there are holes in them. A complete waste of money. Shoddy product for sure."
4,A key ingredient in Skynyrd discography,"This CD, and Nuthin' Fancy, show that good 'ol Shorty Medlocke influence with the diverse,but very southern music songwriting. Bullets is a must have if you are a Ronnie Van Zant fan first,the Skynyrd band second. This is ""gone fishin"" and sitting on the porch music at it's finest.If you are a new Skynyrd fan,get One More From The Road,Pronounced and then Street Survivors. Also consider Gold and Platinum and the boxed set,if you want a major portion of the whole pie.Enjoy ."
3,Put 'Em Back Were They Belong,"Give Me Back My Bullets is the only reason I purchased this CD for that song alone it is worth the price of the CD. The rest is fine, but not my favorite from Skynyrd."
3,back in the saddle?,"this review of ""gimme back my bullets"" comes from a observer of the music skynyrd produced not as a obbessed fan whom buys everyhing i've got ""one more from the road"" one of the best double cd albums ever made..yet i've only ever ventured into the greatest hits packaged that are shoved down my thoat at every corner it seems every few months a new greatest hits album is released..so really i bought a double disc and was overly happyi thought to myself i'd see what their proper albums were likeand this album to my opipion is abit too country for me not sayin' it's bad..just either he needed to be more acoustic rock with less of the country tinge[i hate country]or balls out hard rock that i know skynyrd could do..it's a shame really because there's a great album in thereit's just swamped..but over accesses and not too many highssorry"
5,Southern Rock at it's best.,"Gimmie Back My Bullets is Southern Rock at it's finest. It's is by Florida Artists and is a timeless piece of work and is just a relevant today as it was in 1977 when I saw them perform these songs in Jacksonville Florida, the bands hometown."
4,Poor production sounds better on remaster,"As far as this album is concerned, anything the original Skynyrd recorded is worthwhile!! While the LP had a very flat sound/production quality, the remastered CD is clearer with a little more life to it and definately worth the upgrade if you're still listening to the vinyl.I read an interview with Ronnie where he said he got the idea for the song Gimmme Back My Bullets in response to his desire to get Skynyrd back on the Billboard charts, where songs were marked by 'bullet' indicating song debut/or the number of spots a song had risen since last weeks chart.Ronnie also mentioned that the band finally had to pull the song Gimme Back My Bullets from the setlist because fans continued to throw handfuls of live bullets on stage everytime they played the song when it first came out."
4,don't you dare cry for the bad man,"This album has a country sound to a lot of their songs which I really enjoyed. Some of the more rockin' songs are Gimme back my bullets and double trouble. I got the same old blues is a slower song with a nice groove to it and a harmonica solo. Some of the songs have female vocals, like on double trouble, which are enjoyable. If you want to hear a more country sound from lynyrd skynyrd then you should defenitly check out this cd."
1,Lost n mail,This is 2nd time you've ask for my review. I still have not recvd product. I ordered on Sept. 16th. I have already filed claim. If i ever receive it I will review product.
3,The Universal Truth,"as interpreted by Yogananda. Here Yogananda does a commentaryon ""the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam."" Also an interpretation. Yogananda madethe fatal error of believing that there was only one religion or truth. And that he,himself, could discern it in all religions. He did that with the Bible. He doesthis here with a Sufi poem. But this is a fine book. Very beautiful. But Yogananda'sSelf-Realization Fellowship was and is Hinduism straight up the middle. NotOriginal Christianity and Original Yoga as he claimed. So this book is an Islamicpoem as interpreted by a Hindu. And I think that you had better realize thatbefore you buy this book. And it is a beautiful book. Yogananda was always agreat writer. Most of his books are real ""choppy"" because they are taken from talks.But when he wrote, it was excellent. He was quite a writer. And it comes outin this book. But if you want the ""real stuff,"" buy Yogananda's ""God Talks toArjuna."" Thank you."
5,Slipcovers that work!,"I loved the slipcover that I bought through Amazon.com. The material is sturdy, the colors vibrant, and the slipcover was easy to put on my sofa! I'm very pleased with this product."
5,Great cover at a great price.,"The slipcover is made well and has so far survived two children and a medium-sized dog for over a month, at least much better than the sofa itself did!"
3,couch cover,Looks ok. Bought it too cover a couch that my dog lays on all the time and the cushions were looking pretty sad. This fits well. Probably would look better at a lake cabin though instead of a formal living room.
2,Poor quality,"I just received the sofa slipcover. It is in very poor condition. There were a few stains on it. I washed it, because I was concerned that it was a return that was re-processed, but I thought it would be fine. I laundered it, following the directions on the label. Once washed, the color has already faded, and there are at least 3 new small holes in what appears to be substandard fabric. I purchased a similar slipcover from Target EIGHT years ago, and it doesn't look this bad. The only reason I went through a new vendor was because my previous product was discontinued. Very disappointed."
1,canvas slipcovers,"I ordered a blue and white striped slipcover for a loveseat. I was sent a slipcover for sofa; it wouldn't have made much difference. The slipcover was huge, and after using it for a couple of days, it was even larger. It also got very wrinkly. This product gets a *1."
3,Sage?,"I don't think so...More like olive. The quality was good, just the wrong color. I returned it asap. No problem getting my money back."
2,Bad Fit,"As usual with Amazon, the service was excellent. However, this slipcover did not fit. My measurements were on the money, but this is the second slipcover I have tried, and the fit is terrible. Amazon, made the return very easy, & the refund of product & Postage credit came quickly."
5,Everything you wanted to know about a very reclusive artist!,"This book will make you want to get out of your seat, and do something bold with your life!"
4,from the outside in,"Once again, we learn all of the stories as with many other books,articles or interviews done before. Only, this time we get a more inside look at the exhaustive work habits and the toll it took on the many people who worked with Prince. Sometimes you almost feel the music is a curse of sorts that has made his life insolating in terms of really connecting with people without music being the center of his world.I would doubt very seriously that Prince would agree with this perception.After all, that's all it is. A must read for any Prince loyalist and anyone who considers themselves a musical artist on any level.You must appreciate the work ethic and dedication to a gift that doesn't come along often. There hasn't been a ""Prince"" since he came along over 20 years ago and as a witness of todays state of music...There won't be another for a long time to come..."
4,"Awesome, insightful. Gave daily life in regard to the Bible.",Felt that the book made me know the people of the biblebetter. How they lived and how like us they are in theirdaily life. Wished the author hadn't gone so fast through the years with some of the charaters. One of the best bookson people in the bible I have read
2,But can you get it back in the bag,This is handy when you first open it. Stands on it's own. falls over easily if there is a strong breeze. The biggest problem is getting it back into the bag.
5,Deadly New Friend,"I remember getting this book for Christmas years ago and reading the entire thing that same day. It was so good from start to finish. I used to collect all the Sweet Valley Twins books but the Super Chillers were always my favorites. This one is about a traveling carnival that comes to town and the twins can't wait to go. But their excitement is short lived. When they arrive, they separate in the Funhouse and that's where Elizabeth meet a strange young girl named Claire. She then starts going to the carnival every day to spend time with her new, mysterious friend and begins acting very strangely. Almost as if she's under a spell. Jessica is warned to stay away from the carnival by a fortune teller who tells her she will have no future if she doesn't ,but she knows she must return to save her sister from whatever evil is going on there.Great book with lots of chills and suspense! So glad I was able to find it again."
5,Scotch-Brite Disposable Toilet Scrubber Refills,Great product and I was so happy to find it . Scotch Brite Disposable Toilet Scrubber Refills are good products
3,Good pressure cooker but difficult to find gasket,"I bought the cooker set a while ago it works fine but it is not good for Indian lentils. Usually when I boil yellow lentils, after it starts boiling, it's foam gets inside the whistle and it becomes very difficult to clean. Infact once it became very difficult to open the lid. The plastic handle broke. It is hard to find spare parts in any store.I ordred online . I thought it was very expensive with S+H. If you are not cooking lentils, you should be fine. I think , they should keep the spare parts in local stores."
1,A huge disappointment. Leaks incessantly.,"I'm terribly disappointed with this pressure cooker. It worked great for about two week and now it leaks incessantly near the handle nearly every time I use it. I've checked the seal and cleaned everything thoroughly. It doesn't matter how little water I use or how slowly I bring it up to a boil, it still leaks. I'm going to throw this out and buy a cheap Presto."
2,hello,"This is 4th time i am buying Fagor presssure cooker. PREVIOUS ONES WORKED BETTER.But this is the first time Iam experiencing these problems.It is very difficult to close and open the lid.Everytime WHEN I PUT IT ON STOVE it leaks water through the handle and I have to adjust or make little movement to the orange thing on top of the lid with a tooth pick,then it starts to come up AND STARTS COOKING."
1,not wht it used to be and the Warranty is a sham,i bought this Splendid cooker 2 years back from Macy's. it stopped making steam after i used it max 3 times a year ago. Even though Fagor says that their warranty is 10 years it is such a SHAM! they don't cover anything and for them to replace the handle or the valve even if it is their defect you have to send it to the customer service department at your own shipping cost (mind you that would be high because you are shipping the hole lid). why wont i pay $15 dollars and get a new valve myself. their customer service is so rude and barely helps you. i called at least 20 times in the past 2 months in their NJ number and no one called me back. i am so disappointment in the company and will NEVER NEVER buy a fagor product again
1,Stopped working after 3 months,I've been a user of pressure cooker all my life and I am a fan of Fagor pressure cookers. However the quality has gone down. The first fagor pressure cooker I purchased was made in Spain. This one I purchased in March of 2012 and just 3 months later it stopped working. It makes a loud hissing sound and all the steam escapes. Very scary and a safety hazard to my family. I've also filed a complaint on Fagor's website but wanted to post here also just in case you are considering this pressure cooker. Look elsewhere...
1,HORRIBLE - DO NOT BUY!,Ive had this pressure cooker a little over a year and it has never pressurized properly. The steam comes out from everywhere except where it should be coming out of! Called Fagor because it has a 10-year warranty - they do not pay for shipping and you are without a pressure cooker for who knows how long. Not worth the headache!!!
3,Dodgy purchase,"The back handle grumbled in my hand; no dropping or banging in the first week. I thought I was buying a duo; my mistake. However, the cooker still works fine. I will be more careful with my purchases in the future."
5,Son loves it,"I got this as a Christmas present for my then 2.5 year old son, and he calls it his 'firetruck motorcycle' and loves, loves, loves it. He rides it all around the house, it turns fine, was easy to put together, and he has really enjoyed it. It is a nice intro to a skateboard or an upgraded scooter since it has big 4 wheels. My son is not a risk taker, and he is a nut on this thing. I would definitely recommend, especially if your child likes fire trucks."
3,Cute but misleading ...,"I bought this scooter for my son's birthday. It arrived today and the packaging was HORRIBLE! The blue light on the top was broken and the stickers were all scratched up. I immediately called customer support and they are sending a new top piece for our scooter. Another thing that bothered me was that the website lists the max. weight as 80 lbs, the owners manual lists it as 45 lbs. My son will be getting this at his party on Saturday so he hasn't seen it yet, but he loves EVERYTHING firetrucks, so I'm sure it will be a hit."
4,Fire Truck Lover's Dream,"We purchased this scooter for our son's 3rd birthday. He is approximately 40 inches tall and the scooter fits him well (good handle height, nice size footboard for both size 11 feet).The wheels are good quality, but are properly designed to not roll quickly. This allows my beginner to be able to get a nice flow while pushing with his feet, but coasting is at most a few inches before the stroller rolls to a stop...even on a slight incline - WHICH IS GREAT!When my son holds onto the scooter and starts pushing his hands inevitably twist the handle bars which (much to his delight) starts the sirens and flashing lights. A nice touch for a young child's scooter.My son is infatuated with fire trucks and this scooter was a perfect fit.Highly recommended for boys who love fire trucks.Strong recommendation for a beginners scooter for boys."
4,My son loves it =),"We bought my son this scooter for Christmas, and he really likes it. He's 2 years old so the wide foot base and stability of the product is a real plus. I do wish there was an off button for the siren (it can get a little annoying), but otherwise a great buy!"
5,FX Fat Hair,"I'm glad to be able to find this product online since no one has it locally. It works well for my fine, straight hair, and gives it body and heft while not being heavy or overpowering. Definitely recommend it for others with fine hair."
2,Not what it used to be,"I was thrilled to find this online, but it's not the same product I used to get at Walgreen's and Wal-Mart! The old bottle had a ""New Extra Strength Ultra Thickening Formula"" label on it (yes, I dug it out of the recycling bin to check), whereas this new one does not -- and the new one doesn't work nearly as well as the old stuff. It's better than nothing, but still..."
4,Works really well!,"Works really well, actually does make your hair feel thicker. Not a lot of shine, but does thicken very well!!"
4,Great value for the price,"I really like this hard drive. It's portable and hot-swappable, so I can use it on multiple machines in my house. I've always heard that external hard drives are unstable, but this one has not given me any problems yet (just make sure you turn it off before you unplug it from the system). I only have a few (slight) problems with this hard drive: 1) the separate power adapter can be a bit of a pain, expecially when you're nowhere near an extra outlet, and 2) the USB port is a bit wobbly. I'm always afraid I'm going to break it right off whenever I plug a cord in. You just have to learn to be delicate with it when the cord is plugged in, I guess. Those are the only problems I've encountered, though. Now I just need to figure out what I'm going to fill this thing up with."
4,Pretty good!,"I have had this product for over a year now, the only thing is that I left it on the all the time, and eventually fried the enclosure, so I bought a new enclosure and I was pretty fine still...But if you don't leave it on, I am pretty sure I will be good. But great product for a great price"
1,"Enclosure failure and terrible ""support""","This hard drive worked fine at first but after about a month of use, it simply wouldn't power up when plugged in and turned on. I pulled the hard drive out of the enclosure and put it into another enclosure to verify that the problem was with the enclosure and not the hard drive and it worked fine in my enclosure. I contacted Iomega via their chat system and was told that since I opened the case I had voided the warranty and they wouldn't do anything for me. I will never purchase another iomega product again. The ironic thing is that I will probably spend more on a new enclosure than I did on the original hard drive itself!"
4,Iomega 320GB USB External Hard Drive,Very satisfied. I have had several Iomega backup drives over the years and never been disappointed.
5,I Sold My Bike To Buy This Book,"It was 1980 and I'd been burning for this book I'd seen at the store all year. The only way to afford the monumental price of $40 (I was 11, so that might have been a hundred dollars) was to sell my bike for $40. I have not regretted that one day since, roughly eighteen years later. I still have the book and cherish it. It is THE book for horse lovers. If you love horses, beg, borrow or steal it (or, hey, try Amazon.com) but do ANYTHING to get this book into your library. It is the PERFECT non-fiction horse book with photos by the world's perfect horse photographer. It's even better when you pair it with ""Equus"", this book's predecessor. They go together like mares and stallions. Enjoy the ride."
5,Right price for the correct product!,"This belt is used on a 330i BMW. It fits perfectly, makes no sound and hope it will last just the right amount of time in dry AZ climate before it is replaced."
4,Works great,Quick integration to the Altima. The installation only took 10 minutes to get the Parrot MKi9200 working perfectly. Everything was easy to hook up and took the mystery out of tying it all together.
4,Don't you just love kitten stories,"I agree with the above reviewer, two out of the three are really good and unfortunately it was also the third one I didn't care for as much. Notice, though, I say, as much. I really enjoyed all three. Short stories are great to read because they are short stories. You can usually read them in one sitting (hence the name ""short stories"").Of the three stories, I enjoyed the middle one the most. The naming of the kittens kept me in stiches for days but it was more than that. It was the feel and texture of the book which made it wonderful to read.I live in Arizona so I really don't have weather changes here and this is just a great book. If you live in a warm state, like I do, this book is wonderful to get you in the feel for autumn."
4,I liked this book alot.,"I got this book as a present. I wasn't sure about it because the character is a boy, but I LOVED it. It was a really great adventure and I loved the time travel part. It made some of the things I learned in school more real and interesting to me. Now I went back and read the first book in the series, The Enchanted Runner. Are there more books like thses?"
5,Two books in one,"The left page of each two page spread has very simple text that still includes scientific information. There is also a label for each watercolor illustration on the right page. This is almost a book within a book. The afterword show a small black and white of each illustration and an additional paragraph of more detailed information. Karen Woodworth-Roman, Children's Science Book Review"
3,"not bad, but not near silent","Pro's-relatively quiet (~25 dBA)-rubber washers on easy-out drive mounts-solid buildCon's-not quiet enough: I replaced the casefan with a SilenX. I don't believe SilenX's 14 dBA claim but it is quieter (though still not silent)-front USB ports are not installed well (too recessed)-350S psu has only one fan to make it quieter but increased heat-extra mounting screws come hidden in a compartment at the back-very tight for 9x12 AMD mobo - need to remove psu to change cpu fan.Overall, not bad but I found it for 15 less with less shipping at sup*rwareho*se."
4,Handy pocket guide,"I work in an ICU and kept borrowing one of the other nurse'scopies until finally I purchased one for myself. Soon after,the others were borrowing my copy. Now at work several of ushave a copy on us at all times and find it extremely useful."
5,Felicia Day FTW!,"Felicia Day plays the part of Syd Sherman, who begins each webisode with an entry to her video blog, and the remaining 4 minutes (+/-) depict her struggles to lead the normal life that any shy, too-nice-for-her-own-good, child-prodigy, gamer-girl would like to lead.This is a good series about how the lives of Syd and her five guild mates' lives become more entwined with each webisode. Like any good comedy, there are running gags, and quirky routines that flow throughout that make the series so much more enjoyable as a whole, than a single webisode viewed here and there.As a geek and part time gamer, I've met some people like these characters online in the MMORPG that I play, and find the enactment of guildee interaction and guild drama classically hilarious! I believe everyone will embrace ""The Guild"" and its cast as everyone has embraced those on ""Big Bang Theory"" (CBS - Mondays)."
2,"Quite disappointing, if you ask me...","I refer only to disc no. 1, which I have just heard. Well, Argerich is really not something. She's extravagant-impressive in the more ""aggressive"" pieces, but terribly disappointing in the more lyrical ones. Her left hand is banging, and she misses the whole Chopin sentimentality.For the Preludes I recommend Pogorelich, although his tempos are altogether crazy (this makes him original and surprising), or Pollini (no one equals his lucidity, and his fast tempo is also intriguing), or Ashkenzy (the most ""standard"" among the great ones), or - of course - good old Brailowsky (I hope they managed to improve the sound). Argerich is far behind them."
3,"Good content, crappy book",This book has a lot of great information that is very useful for quantitation of matter and energy fluxes in the environment. However....the book quality (paperback) is extremely poor.This is the only book in the last 7 years that I've managed to get so frustrated with that I almost dislike the book...(hence 3 stars). I find it impossible to stay on one page with bracing the book with both hands...and I accidentally tore the backing apart a little bit just trying to keep it open. Arrrggghhh.....Overall great resource though.
2,ALL the FRENCH YOU NEED,"These tapes are advertised as helpful for the beginner to the high intermediate. I took 7 years of French in High School and University and am embarking on a career as a Flight Attendant, so I bought these tapes to assist me in brushing up my skills. I am very disappointed in them. I did not find them helpful at all. Unless saying things like, ""Tomorrow, I'm going to walk on the sidewalk."" is going to help you. Or, ""Do you like the Post Office?"", Oh yes, its a favorite pastime of everybody. I don't think in my entire English speaking life, I have ever had the occasion to say that. ... It would have been great to have more than one native speaker as an example. ... I think these tapes are very expensive, and not worth it. They might only be helpful to the very beginning student that is playing around with learning French, because this most certainly is NOT ""All the French You Need""."
4,Sky My Kingdom,"I enjoyed this book. The first I heard of Hanna Reitsch was an article in the ""Air Classics"" February 1979 edition and her deeds are discussed(some not too complimentary) in The History Channel's ""No Surrender"" DVDs on Japanese and German Kamikazes Getting her side of the stories provides balance. A remarkable and determined woman (all 5' 1'' of her!!!)"
3,An important historical record,"An interesting story of Hannah Reitsch' life in flying and in pre and wartime Germany. I found it well worth reading. She was one of the best pilots of her time, and had contact with many of the key Nazi figures in the war. It would be interesting to know her personal political views, but she carefully avoids any political tenor to her writing."
5,Required reading!,Great book. Wooden proves to be much more than a terrific basketball coach. He's the consumate teacher. No wonder why UCLA basketball was so successful!
5,Love his advice,"John Wooden has great advice no matter what sport you coach, if you are single or a parent. I am making my boyfriend read this book because his philosophies are how I want my future family to be raised. I am also a coach and value his knowledge and experience and will be transcribing that to my kids during this basketball season as well as future teams I will coach."
5,Inspiration from the greatest coach ever,"I have given over 30 copies of this book as gifts over the last few years. This is sort of an abridged version of the life & teachings of John Wooden, famed UCLA basketball coach who took Bruins to 10 national titles. For quick reference, in the back of the book is a summary of his inspirational and humorous quotes, for whenever I need a quick recharge."
5,I love his books,"John Wooden has been blessed with such wisdom and he has used this blessing to build up and influence millions of people, young and old. I have many books by John Wooden and even though I usually buy them sight unseen I know I will never be disappointed...and I never have. This particular book is jammed packed with wonderful, thought provoking quotes and stories. I will treasure this book, along with all his others, forever."
5,Advice on Life,"Feel inspired and find the strength to keep going in whatever you pursue. Wooden is not just an expert on basketball, but on life as well."
5,Great condition Great Price,"I ordered a book about John Wodden and my transaction was very smooth. My shipping cost and book price were very fair, and i recieved the item in great condition as described."
5,This is scripture for the basketball fans.,"For anyone who's familiar with college basketball, or has heard the sometimes maniacal ravings of Bill Walton on NBC, the name John Wooden symbolizes all that was right with basketball lo those many years ago. Wooden's intelligence, ingenuity and precise sense of how to teach, lead and deal with people is something everyone can learn from. Wisdom such as his is rare. It isn't bestowed on many. Fortunately for basketball fans, Wooden chose to direct his wisdom to the game instead of what may be perceived as a nobler profession. Wooden's ""Pyramid of Success"" adorns my wall now that I have read this book. This is scripture for the basketball fans."
4,I'll pile on a bit here,"Yeah, I agree that this is better than the follow up. It's not necessarily as polished, but it has more character to it, a real freaky focus on souls and death with Thirsk's vocals soaring to seemingly impossible heights on songs like ""Awaiting Eternity"". Yeah, I know, sounds pretty gruesome, and it gets a little preachy, but don't be put off too much, just enjoy the music and Kristy's awesome pipes.By the way, the band itself is gone, but Thirsk has done some nice things with Delerium and is presently active with another group. She has a website, I'll let you check it out if this makes you want to follow her."
5,Andy Kim,To The Company Who Put These 2 Albums Out On CD Thank You Very Muchbecause I Did't Know Any Of These Album Were Ever In Print. I Listin To Some Of The Songs And A Lot Of Them I Don't Know About And They Will Have To Grow On Me.
4,Chest-thumpingly essential,"A scrupulously researched and heart-felt bio, if not always the best written. The author gets cuaght up up in his topic and overreaches his writing abilities.Cooper was one of those amazing men whose life encompassed war, travel, explornography, mythopoeia, cinema, big business, and, at least to his own eye, international relations. The book does a wonderful job of seeking out all the details of these endeavors and tying them into a fine package. Deservedly best known for King Kong (1933 and only), Cooper was certainly a man of his century."
2,Way too sweet,"This taco sauce is way too sweet, in my opinion. I tried some on a bean burrito this morning and it tasted like sugary ketchup. I have found nothing that beats Taco Bell hot Restaurant sauce."
3,Illustrations Far Outpace the Writing,"I found that the illustrations far outpace the writing in Big Woods Bird. The illustrations have a nice warmth to them that kids will find engaging. However, the writing style is a fairly hokey rhyme, which on occasion misses on both rhyme and rhythm. In my opinion, the writing didn't convey the excitement and mystery of outdoor adventure, but the illustrations do, which saves the book.It's a pretty, if flawed, book. As the only children's book about the ivory-billed woodpecker, there isn't much choice if you want a book on this topic geared to younger children."
4,A People of Destiny : Finding Your Place in God's Apostolic,I found this book to be very informative regarding the current wave of the Apostolic/Prophetic movement. Good guidelines regarding characteristics of an Apostolic church and good historical information.
4,great,Great fun game. It's a classic in a convenient travel size. Fun for the whole family. Who doesn't love don't wake daddy?
3,Good Drink Mix,"I knew I don't like tomato soup, but wanted to try this and judge against the other veggie drinks I purchased -- if you are into tomato juice/drink guess it's great, I'm not so will probably not buy again!"
3,Not my cup of tea,"I searched this out on Amazon and ordered it based on the reviews and the product info. provided. Once I received it, I read the instructions and began using. One scoop is way overpowering and the powder does not seem to want to melt. I used boiling water after the first use and still ended up with a glop in my cup. I used half a scoop and had the same problem.I personally had problems with the dust from the powder overwhelming me and causing a stealing of my breath. I also found the taste to be too fruity. I passed the powder on to a friend who is getting along fine. I personally would not order this again but would recommend to others if you don't eat your fruits and vegetables."
4,Only 1 thing wrong..,"This is a great headset, but i have 1 problem. i have a small ear so it's a little tight but great sound, and the people in the other end can't belive taht i;m not on my cell."
3,Not bad for the price,"The only complaint I have is that it sometimes falls out of my ear. When it does stay in, it still feels like it's going to fall out. Otherwise its not bad for the prices. You get used to it."
2,GOOD BUT SENSITIVE,"THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD IN GENERAL, GOOD RECEPTION, NICE FIT. ALL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. IT SUDDENLY STOPPED WORKING CONSIDERING I'M VERY CAREFUL WHEN TAKING CARE OF MY THINGS. I CAN HEAR WHO I'M TALKING WITH BUT THEY CAN'T HEAR ME. I'VE RESET IT MANY TIMES AN TESTED INCOMING AND OUTGOING CALLS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED BUT I DO PLAN ON GETTING ANOTHER ONE, I LOVE THE SIZE. BUT IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN I'LL BE SURE TO LEAVE A FOLLOW UP REVIEW."
4,"Great performance, sorry fit","I love the way it sounds nad most of the time, the person i'm talking to has no problem hearing me. But for some reason, the dang earpiece doesn't fit snug enough and I often find myself catching the bluetooth as it falls out of my ear. Plantronics earpieces fit so great! I wish Samsung could adopt a similar model."
2,"Great movie, disappointing book",I bought the book after enjoying the movie many times. All I can say is that the screen writer deserves an Oscar for the movie version because the book just doesn't have the plot or character portrayal. I would suggest buying the DVD and forget buying the book.
3,modern music,"I bought this CD for the one song on it : ""My bombombomb"" which is a fabulous fox trot ballroom style dance. Slow it to minus 4 for best results. But unfortunately that is the only song I like on it.So I recommend you to just download the single song from amazon and don't buy the rest of the disk unless you really like the group. He does have a few other songs I like, but they were not on this disc.Terry"
3,VISTA VS XP,"More for Vista users, I'm XP. Gave to my 11 yr old grandaughter as she was gifted with a Vista product. She is a happier camper!"
5,Great introduction to laptops!,* Excellent introduction to laptops* Helps you decide what kind of laptop is best for you* Great section on making the most of your laptop* Teaches you how to optimize the laptop for usage on the road* Nice section on extending your laptop's battery life
4,Makes lovely shade. Impossible to fold,"I bought this for my beach vacation to help shade my very fair skinned baby.It made great shade, it has pockets on the outside to help with holding it down if it is windy out.The frame was very solid.BAD NEWS though, I couldn't get it folded back into the carrier no matter how hard I tried. I had several other people try to fold it too, it was a no go.It was so difficult that I ended up ditching it in Antigua rather than try for another 45 minutes to get it back into the little circle that it came in.I do not recommend this product at all."
5,Nice Features,This knife has some great features such as the cushion grip and the small tab at the end of the handle that prevents the knife from rolling. Its a great step up from the typical exacto knife and the protective cap is much easier removed.
4,Excellet read for ages 9-12,"Great books for children! They will learn a lot of new and useful vocabulary in addition to what they read at school. Although I am well over the age of 12, my little cousins were raving about them so I had to read a few books from the series. Now I look forward to seeing the movie in November! So go pick up a boxset today! You're missing out if you don't."
1,Horribly negative books,"I had heard the hype about these books and decided to read them myself. I expected to read about events that are sheer bad luck, or harmlessly unfortuante. I was appalled by the violence, cruelty and utter evil that takes place in these books. Are murder, contemplation of poisoning, deceit and child abuse values that we desire to instill in our children?? Although the writing style is intriguing and the inclusion of definitions of vocabulary words is potentially beneficial, I would strongly urge parents to read these books prior to allowing their children to read them. I'll stick with JK Rowlings any day. At least she has good triumph over evil."
1,Very disappointing,"The Unfortunate Events books are about three orphaned children named Sunny, Violet and Klaus. They are being chased by a meanie named Count Olaf who is after the large sum of money that they inherited from their late parents. Everything that happens in these books is horrible. Also, Lemmony Snicket has the habit of getting caught up in explaining what ""truth shmuth"" means or giving lectures on the begining sentence of a book. I can assure you, this can get very annoying. There are probably a few people out there who like depressing books such as this, but thankfully, I am not one of them."
1,disappointed,Actually this should received less than one star! I don't believe it is necessary to talk down to children...such as taking a whole paragraph explaining what a word means...the thought is implied and brought through in context... I just don't think there was much to the story most of which was explaining the vocabulary used in a sentence.
1,Offensive and stupid,"Gosh, now we have the right worrying about bared breasts for about 10 milliseconds at superbowls, but parents raving about a children's book that glorifies child abuse (locking a toddler in a bird cage, taping her mouth shut, and threatening to drop her from a tower is not dark humor to a child) and implied child rape - Olaf says to Violet that he will dispose of her siblings and keep her around because she is pretty. I wish these books were given 1/1000ths of the scrutiny of rock music, tv, etc. What a sad state this country is in when these are popular. They shouldn't have been published. And I don't care if the ending is happy or sad, it is what is in between that counts. Maybe Count Olaf should have been play by Christopher Walken. For good children's books with humor, sometimes dark, read something by Terry Pratchett."
2,Not a very Nice read,"my friends had been telling me forever that this was a good series of books, so i read the first one, and i hated it. it was depressing, sad, and nothing good happened at all! nothing! i know that the topic of three orphaned siblings is not a very happy one, but come on! the book totally brouhgt me down after i finished it. when i read the last sentence, i thought, how disappointing! if you get depressed easily, don't read this!! if you like sad things happening all the time and lots of adventure, read this series, i guess. but overall, it was bad"
1,Definitely unfortunate,"My 9 yr old read the first few pages of the first book in the series. He was not ""captured"" by the author's intent. After reading the first few chapters myself, I could only conclude that this series is a children's version of violence and abusiveness. This book is not something we need to expose our children into thinking that this is a ""good read"".Missing the idea that this is a good book.Reader in Dallas"
1,If there was a negative scale then this book series would get it,"Parents beware!!!!!My 11 year old brought this book home. My mother (his grandmother read this book in about an hour) and immediately upon finishing it scowled and informed me that this was one of the most disturbing books she had ever read. I then read it as well. I am terrified that the public elementary school which would allow this type of material in the library for our children to read. Honestly, it's evil, dripping with evil. The adult characters physically abuse, emotional abuse, and generally plot evil intentions upon newly orphaned children. A highlight for me was the evil caregiver dangling a baby sister who was bound and caged like an animal, hung from a tall tower, until the 14 year sister agrees to marry him in a fowl attempt to gain the children's trust fund. WHAT?!?!?!?!?!Not only was it not appropriate for a child, it was frightening and unappealing at any age.Don't buy this garbage. Don't allow it in your home."
4,Chris's Review!,"This is a great book.Although it is very sad ,it's great!In this book there is a man named Count Olaf,who is their meady,greedy uncle.The Baudelaire orphans receive very,very misfortune in this book.The siblings name's are Klaus,Violet,and Sunny.Their first misfortunate event is when their parents get killed in a very bad fire.Count Olaf is a very mean man it says that Count Olaf struck Klaus in the face.I would not recommend this book to kids under 5."
5,Fantasic,"Once you pick it up you can't put it down. I read these so quickly because they were excellent and couldn't wait to read more .....! I am now on the last chapter of Book 8 and don't want to read it until Book 9 comes out . It will be hard to wait until October.My sister , who is only 6 , is reading the first book and loves it too."
2,Really Confusing,"I really didn't get the point of the first book. I don't know whether the point was to escape from Count Olaf's house, to get away from the play or to rescue Sunny from the tower. I hope the second one is better."
1,Too Much Negativity,"Although lots of people find these books wonderful, I don't. The story starts out sad, and the plot is sad, too much ""bad guy"" in it, and it ends sadly-""bad guy"" gets away. I know that ""Mr. Snicket"" has a unique sense of humor, and I appreciate his writing style...I just don't care for it. I would not read these books if you are sad, because they will not cheer you up. They just made me mad. Lol."
5,Leomony Snicket volumes 1-3,These boooks are so excellent!! i just love the way L.S. has to tell the reader what every big word means! i think its so awsome. My mom bought me a 3 pack and i love them all. My favorite is the Reptile Room because Uncle Monty is so cool and it shows how clever all 3 kids are. I love these books and i cant WAIT to get the rest!!
4,Great Book!,"First off I am not going to say that I have read all of these books... In fact I've just finished the first book about 2 and a half hours ago. The only thing I did not like about this book was (and this has nothing to do with the way he wrote them or the cover or anything of that sort) this. I wish I could have read them in second grade! I am not insulting the book at all, all I wanted to say is that I would have enjoyed them a lot more if I had read them while I still was seven and a half. One other thing... make them longer! Anyways, your 7-11 year old will be delighted by these books... ok well at least the first one cause I'll have to check up with you about the rest when I get to those... Anyways good job Mr. Snicket!"
4,My children can't get enough,"I enjoy reading these books to my children, and my eldest reads and re-reads them on his own. The only thing annoying to me as a reader is Sir Lemony's habit of explaining what words mean. Yet this annoyance to me is a source of joy to my seven year old, who doesn't have to ask what words mean and thus interrupt the story. This stylistic habit of Mr. Snicket also means that my child is learning a lot of new words -- and that the books are not written DOWN to children but respect their intelligence. Also, the iconoclastic nature of this new genre of book makes them truly fun to read and easy to relish. Children don't really like goody-goody books -- mine, at least (and I bet yours), see at once they are being condescended to. Lemony Snicket's works are both fun, genre-breaking, and, (thus undermining my word ""both"") terrific reads."
4,This is not for the touchy feely,"I read this book and at first was a bit put off. However, as I read more, I found the book to be very interesting and did not want to put it down. The book offers encouragement to readers, by generally stating to make the best of an awful situation. The book also gives definitions to words which a reader may not recognize. The reader of this book should grasp the underlying meaning that ""bad things happen to good people"" and not to give up hope. The circumstances these children face are terrible, but they never seemed discouraged. They keep moving forward. These series may also be helpful for young person going through a rough time, because he/she can identify with the children."
3,What's all the hype about?,"I read the first three of Lemony Snicket's books after hearing much praise about them but I am still trying to figure out what the praise is about. True, the books are well written and I value that. But I have found the books to be quite frustrating in that it seems as though they will all have a very similar theme in each one: three orphans trying to save themselves from a cruel world. I do not find that terribly creative. I would really like to know what it is about these books that everyone is so thrilled about!"
5,It sat forever until the first page was turned.,"My 11 year old son received this set for a gift and the box sat under his bed for a long, long time. Then he turned the first page. He's a fan. Highly recommended."
2,If you're trying to raise literate children - eschew this!,"(Which, in this instance, means ""pick another writer."") Snicket is clever -- these books are black humor, juvenile-style and, as an adult, I found them amusing. Good literature, however, needs to have some redeeming quality beyond cleverness. Some tension to make the drama ""work."" I agree with my 9-year-old grandson (an avid reader) who complained, ""There's nothing good EVER happens!"" The stupidity of the adults is doubtless endearing to at least some children -- but it is not enough on which to construct a world. I confess I do not see why these books are so popular when there is so much excellent children's fiction on the market today."
4,May be too much for younger readers,"I have been searching for a more challenging chapter book series for my 1st grader. I read part of the first chapter of this book at the bookstore and found the writing style very intriguing. So I bought it for my daughter, being that she needed something more than Junie B. Jones. The night she read the first couple of chapters, she ended up in tears because of the parents dying. She is incredibly sensitive and this was too real for her. She has continued on in the series without any further breakdowns but parents with sensitive children, be aware that there are events in the books that may be upsetting."
4,Don't know why everyone else has problems with this,"I purchased this thermometer 18 mos ago and absolutely love it. It is quick and easy to use, and there is no maintenance. As for those who are having trouble finding probe covers, they are sold at Walgreens or any other drugstore. They are not first year brand, but the Walgreens brand works just as well. I hope this helps. Please consider this theremometer, your children will thank you because of the unintrusive, painless readings."
1,go for the more expensive forehead scanning thermometer!,"i could not get this thing to read the correct temperature on me, much less my baby . . . not too comforting when you're wondering if your baby has a fever or not. no matter what angle i had the thermometer at it always read 96.7, on me and my baby. go for the slightly more expensive forehead scanning thermometer (target doesn't carry it but babies r us does), it's super fast and much more accurate."
4,Don't know why others have so many problems - I love it,"This is the only thermometer we use at our house, my husband and I included. It is so easy. Just be sure to hold the top of the ear straight up then insert the probe, this should give you the right angle. As for the probe covers, you can use any generic cover. I bought a package of Walgreens brand covers and they work just as well. They are not the exact same and do look different, but looks and functionality are two separate things. Get over the cover issue and go to Walgreens or any drug store. Please don't let the other reviews scare you. This is a great product."
1,Probe covers unavailable - Product Discontinued?,"Not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over Internet, it seems that First Years has discontinued the product. At least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website. We searched for model 4290 - the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer. Apparently, they don't see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued. Furthermore, the site is full of broken image links.The thermometer works well but without probe covers, it's not a good investment. You can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers. If the store you're buying the thermometer at doesn't have covers there, find another product with covers available."
3,great but probe covers a pain,"easy to use, disappointed that probe covers aren't easily accessible....called corporate about replacement probe covers, available mail order $3 for pack of 20-not much help for me today. The First Years, attn. Mail Order, 1 Kiddie Dr., Avon, MA 02322. She said any generic 'flexible probe covers' would also work...I'll try that."
2,Can't get it right,"Maybe it's just me, but I can never seem to get it to angle just right to take an accurate temperature!"
2,probe covers,I have only found ONE place to buy probe covers for this thing - so I bought a lot. They aren't the same manufacturer - but they are the exact type of probe covers. Hope this helps others looking for covers for this. If the first years doesn't sell probe covers for this anymore - they shouldn't let companies sell the thermometer either.http://www.shoplet.com/office/db/g2512530.htm l
1,useless,"This thermometer is totally worthless. It doesn't read the correct temp. on myself, husband or baby. When my little one was sick at 3 months old, this thing read 96.7 degrees on all three of us. I picked up a digital 'under the tongue' type and simply used it under his arm. Works great--cost me $3.I can't GIVE this one away!"
1,not proofread,"I would not have purchased this book if I had previewed it. It is full of misspellings and poor grammar. If I pay money for a book, I expect it to have been proofread. I found it to be like reading someone's email story. Simple vocabulary. I couldn't believe Amazon would sell such a thing."
5,Buy this book for your kindle,"Good book for the long cold nights, Going to try another one I have seen from this author, but it is not out for kindle yet :)"
4,Surprising,I read this book in one go! Extremely easy read but good story. Must agree with others large amount of grammer and spelling mistakes but otherwise good read. Story was very surprising considering that I had bought it a while ago and was unsure what the story was about. Starts of beautiful story and then whammo the wolves attack and then survival kicks in. Keeps you engaged until the end.
1,complete waste of time,"I bought this book based on all the excellent reviews it got, and now I think they must all have been written by the author's friends. This book is terrible, I couldn't believe all the misspelled words and grammatical errors, and just plain bad writing. The only good thing I can say about it is that it goes to show you that just about anyone can get something published these days. The cover says the author taught herself how to write, and I believe it - no one who writes this poorly could have graduated from school."
1,Pathetic,"I have been buying books from Amazon for some years now and this is the most pathetic excuse for writing I have ever seen. I want my money back. How could anyone with at least a room temperature IQ consider this misspelled,sloppy,bumblig,piece of garbage writing? If this is as good as the author can do she should stick to painting pictures of mountains for people who can actually write."
5,LOVED THIS BOOK AND BEAUTIFUL COVER!!!,"I am not a reader but this author has drawn me into her writings! I have both her new books and with each one, seems to get better and I can't wait for her next one to be available because I will be online to order it too! Wonderful Job April! I hope you come to Austin, Tx for a book signing so I can meet the amazing lady who keeps me checking for more of your books! April ~ You are my absolute favorite talented person! Thank you for sharing your talent with all of us who have the chance to read and see your works! ((((((((((((((APRIL)))))))))))))))) Trina&Derek love it also!!!!!!!!!"
5,ACT 2005 is the greatest,"I want to thank you karen for the remarkable book, it is very easy and at the same time have everything in it . I enjoyed reading the book and hope you can write more, so many people in the IT industry will enjoy reading Books again. Please keep on the good work. God Bless you."
5,Best Follow-Up to an Impressive Debut,"While most follow-up releases to a debut are not good, or are just average, SAHARA shines as a better follow-up to an impressive debut from House of Lords. This album contains several tracks -- ""Chains of Love"", ""Can't Find My Way Home"", and ""Remeber My Name"" -- that help give SAHARA."
5,Hot Rock,"This CD is hot, every song has a driving rock beat, heavy rock that is great, I love this CD, wore my original one out, played it so much!"
2,Useless for a child,"I bought this case to keep my daughters new First Act Acoustic Guitar safe from harm that she got for Christmas. I made the assumption that the company would only make something that worked well for children, since that is what they tailor to. When I received the product- I was very dissappointed. The case is a soft-sided case that basically folds in half whether the guitar is in the case or not. It is too large for my daughter's guitar, and I can't see how the case could possibly keep a guitar from harm unless a parent were to hang the case up in a closet out of the way of the world. Children just need a hard-sided case for guitars. A company who makes guitars for children should know this and make something for this purpose."
5,Great for teachers or a summer bridge!,"I have taught both middle and high school English classes, and this is by far the best grammar resource I have used. Each lesson (nouns, verbs, participles, etc.) is set up so that the student has clear instructions which are followed by an example. The problems are varied, so it is not the drill-and-kill approach, and because of the examples, parents will be able to help their children."
1,Not worth it- No answer key,I bought this to use as a supplement in my class. The activities are basic and not creative. In addition there is no answer key. It appears to be the suplemental student book that goes along with the textbook. Nothing new here.
4,A very thoughtful beginning,"Charlene Burns has done a great service to the the community of faith which seeks to faithfully gather around Jesus Christ. Rescuing the Incarnation from the confusing and largely irrelevant categories of ancient Greek philosophy, Ms. Burns has returned the Incarnation to its more proper sphere of relationality.As a Pastor, preacher and teacher, I find much to ponder in the ideas put forth by Dr. Burns. At last we have the beginnings of a new language with which to express both the profound mystery and intensely personal experience of the divine we call faith.I will read Dr. Burns' book again and again.Dr. Daniel LoomisFirst Presbyterian ChurchEl Dorado, AR"
3,"The book was ok if you are a seasoned profoessional, but definitely recommended for the rookie","The book itself is a good ""refresher"" if you are in a slump in phone sales, but is more directed towards the rookie in the field. If you are getting into phone sales, this would be a good book to read to go over the basics and some strategies in handling objections. However if you are a seasoned professional, skim it like cliff notes and you will find one or two things valuable to add to your arsenal of techniques."
5,Share with my whole team,I found this excellent information for both inside and outside sales professionals. After reading this insightful book I bought copies for my entire sales staff.
2,For beginning beginners who are just starting only.,"I am UNIMPRESSED by this book. The first fifty pages read like a Junior High School essay - the book seem to be trying to convince the reader that it contains valuable knowlege, which it then fails to deliver. There are some good ideas in there, but you have to mine through trite platitudes and shamefully plain observations to get to them. I don't recommend this one unless you are an absolute beginner in phone sales - or rather, a beginner in talking on the phone."
5,Pick Up This Book Before You Pick Up The Phone,"It would be a disservice to Renee and Sandra to describe this book as simply a book that helps you sell better over the phone. While it certainly does that, it does so much more. The advice offered applies as much to providing great customer service as anything. There is a lot of great insight on how to make connections with people, which is, after all, the most essential part of making people want to do business with you. Pay special attention to Chapter 3 - Identifying Personality Types Over the Phone. It's worth the price of the book alone. Cleverly written, using a music metaphor, it never stoops to gimmicks. Instead, it earns the reader's respect the old fashioned way - by providing solid advice you can implement immediately to impact your bottom line."
2,Buy a different book!,"This book is useless. The manner in which it is written is trite and patronizing. For example,""As a professional salesperson, you know all about features and benefits. It's just like everyone knows that you wash your hands after going to the bathroom...""Reading sentences like this piss me off. GET TO THE POINT. GLAD YOU FEEL THE NEED TO TRY AND INSULT ME. I BOUGHT YOUR STUPID SALES BOOK, MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, I DO NOT KNOW.And it doesn't get any better. On that same page you get to this line,""There are basically only five benefits in the business world, regardless of what you sell: 1. Saving time, 2. saving money, 3. increasing revenue, 4. reducing stress, 5. improving productivity.""Well, lets see, the mother of all phone salespeople: Stockbrokers.Stocks don't really fit neatly into any of those categories. It's a bet, its a gamble and it's to make money. Increasing revenue!?! Is that stupid for Making Money? BECAUSE NOTHINGS MORE CLEAR THAN ""MAKING MONEY."""
3,DONE,"At first i was upset at the product it is not as easy to install as the direction say but know that it is in i am ok, pluss the customer service was very helpfull"
1,Disappointed,"Really disappointed. Thought this would be unique, unlike major stores who carry pond liners. Wrong. Pump is very small and the liner is still not unfolded enough to put in the ground. I don't think I can use this for my project."
2,Knuffle Bunny is Great! The remaining 60 minutes is not.,"Knuffle Bunny is great, it's awesome - but it's only 5 minutes long. The Scholastic Storybook Treasures feature a ""main event"" that gets you to buy the disc. Then they fill the rest of the DVD like the undercard of a major boxing match. The second story - ""Shrinking Violet"" is very good also. Two good stories, but the remaining stories are quite boring. At least, my three and a half year old thought so. Knuffle Bunny and Shrinking Violet are worth the price, just don't expect the full DVD to be as good as Knuffle Bunny."
3,A little violent for the young ones,"The VHS was sent on time and in good condition. As far as the content of the tape, my young son was a little worried over the choking scenes when the evil one appeared to be winning. Otherwise, it was pretty much as expected."
2,A very dry piece of writing,"Although I had Madsen as a professor at the University of Iowa and thouroughly enjoyed the class, Political Behavior, the man can not write! The piece is very dry and moves very slowly. Although it is easy to understand, except when he gets to chapter 3 and starts to talk about the derivations and math stuff. I know that case studies are not interesting most of the time, but he could have tried a little bit harder to make it so. That's my story and I'm sticking to it."
4,Keith Jarrett - a great discovery,"I'd just heard about him, this great pianist. I had to satisfy my curiosity... This DVD shows Keith Jarrett's different styles, tastes and ... his way of moving around while playing! Just sit back and enjoy, open your eyes and ears!"
5,John Marshall Definer of a Nation,"The book is a very good description of the life and times of a key founder of our nation. It combines a fascinating account of his early life and a very compelling account of his judicial philosophy. The book makes very good reading for lawyers, law students and for all those who appreciate a life well lived."
4,Great Biography For A Great Man,"This biography was well written and very informative on a key Founding Father of United States. With limited legal precedent and experience to draw on, John Marshal and his court laid the foundation for an enduring form of constitutional government"
5,Judging Marshall,"This was great biography of the chief justice. It achieved that rare balance in historical biographies of being loaded with lots of interesting details while not being too dry to enjoy. As usual in the better biographies, the author is definitely in Marshall's corner, but he includes some of Marshall's botches and does an OK job of explaining why his opponents disagreed with him.The greatest strength of the book was the descriptions of how Marshall came to his judgments in the various cases; how he balanced the law as it was written versus what he thought would be practical (ie, enforceable), and how it he used the constitution to frame all of his rulings. The author describes Marshall's thinking in an extremely accessible way, using no legal gobbledy-gook.Also, the play-by-play of how the XYZ affair unfolded was great fun to read. It was by far the best version of that event I have ever read."
5,"Flat Latigo Lead 1"" x 6'",This is a very high quality leather lead that we are extremely happy with. The hardware is strong and there is no doubt you have control of your dog when using this lead. It is easy to grip while walking our large and strong Alaskan Malamutes even while wearing gloves.
2,Yuck!,"I did not like this granola. I wanted something to put into my yogurt and because I eat plain yogurt with fresh fruit I wanted something with at least SOME sweetness. This has practically no sweetness and it's very well done, too brown, almost burnt, kind of how my granola used to come out if I left it in the oven too long. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the crunch held up very well in the yogurt, it didn't get soggy."
3,Hem Dazon,"The legs don't move right, other than that its a knees don't bend right. The arms and the overall look works okay. My kids like because they like to play with alien characters."
3,Thought it was for titanium work. It's not.,Bought it because I was mislead by its name. Needed a epoxy for titanium material. This is not really indicated to that.
1,Horrid Sound,"The song selection is ok, but the sound on this set is terrible. But that should be expected coming from some random import company, who only copy old 78's, cassettes, or previously released legitimate CD's. If you want a Bing Crosby Christmas CD, there are many to choose from that are produced by Decca/MCA (Crosby's recording company) that are in much better sound than this hollow, muffled piece of plastic. Just type in ""Bing"", ""Christmas"" and ""Decca"" (or MCA), and you'll find plenty."
5,Good Find,This pendant is well made and handsome. Looks good on either men or women. Beautifully made
4,Great Book for the casual Hiker,"This a great book detailing out many 'Great Walks' in Yosemite. We walked many of them, and used the guide to extend many others. The book would be more helpful if it included a map of the area, as some of the driving and trail instructions are a bit hard to follow. Would recommend it to anybody who is not a hard core hiker, but just likes the short half day hikes."
5,Beautiful book,"This book is a work of art in itself. Not only are there beautiful pictures, but the narrative that goes with each picture is very well written and informative. You learn that Terpning is as much a historian as he is an artist. When he depicts a person from a particular tribe, he paints the correct clothing and hair style for that tribe. I also learned that various tribes had different facial structures."
1,Bad product,"The fountain arrived with a non-working pump. But the return request was repetitively ignored/not responded. I had to get Amazon involved and Amazon did a wonderful job dealing with the merchant. It seems a few customers had the motor pump issues, I should have known to stay away from it."
4,The Code or a List of Steps to Success,"Starts out slow and is not the most exciting to listen to, but it has many good points and the workbook is great."
2,Too thick,"Product is too thick meaning it pushes your toes apart. The gold tone fades very quickly. Basically, I had it a month before trashing it."
4,"Okay, it is about Ethics","Well written and completely accessible to the average reader this book brings what can be a very heady topic down to earth where we can all wrestle with it. If you only like to read novels then this is not for you, after all it is a book about ethics. If, on the other hand, you are interested in a book that will lead you to a deeper understanding of yourself, our culture, and the dynamics that play out in groups from families to nations then this book will offer you some valuable insights."
2,Review Title,"Basically a book on ethics that ultimately attempts to redefine the objectivity of moral values to mean subjective (relativistic) moral values. The author's never take their logical implications to their conclusion, however, and if one is not careful, one can be left with the impression that their ethical positions are objective, when they are really moral relativists. There is also a conflicting amalgum of ethical positions, including trying to combine a liberation theology's ethical position with their position (which is ultimately moral relativism) with a Christian twist. This creates quite an ugly creature of ethics if you ask me."
1,HORRIBLE,"I am currently in an ethics class and this book was required for the course. This is by far the most repetitive and useless book you will ever use in your entire life. NO JOKE. It offers no insight into things that you dont already know. It simply takes what you already know, puts it into fancier words, and spits it right back at you. If this book is not a requirement for a class then dont waste your money. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to go throw this peice of crap in a volcano and forget I was ever plagued by its stupidity and uselessness."
1,Not a good monitor.,"Having used a HP L2335 for two years, I decided to buy this cheap 19"" LCD monitor for my secondary desktop thinking that the quality of entry level LCDs should now be on par with expensive LCDs from two years ago. Unfortunately, that is not the case.This monitor has several problems:1) Major backlight bleeding especially around the edge of the screen.2) Terrible black level. The black level is simply too white. This makes the backlight bleeding near the edge even more visible.3) Terrible ""vertical"" view angle. No mater how high I stand or how low I seat, I could not get a even brightness out of the screen.4) Requires lots of adjustments (both OSD and Windows Desktop) and I could not get a satisfactory color level."
1,Poor visual quality,"Broad vertical dark bands, uneven colors, auto-focuses every time it powers up (thus getting rid of your attempts to fix the image), shimmers from time to time. I've tried this for a week and am returning it. Worst monitor I've ever used."
4,"Large, vibrant colors with very little heat output","I've had this product for probably just over a year now and have had no problems with it. The pixels are 100% and the colors are great.Not the most expensive, but it looks great and works just fine."
4,Nice,Good value for the money. Only rated four stars because the fifth string on mine was a bit hard to tune.
2,Marginal,"I ordered 4 of these for family members for Christmas stocking stuffers. One of the four was broken when it arrived - sounds like the glue holding the prisms had given way, probably due to some banging around during shipping. The other 3 were physically OK, but the viewing image wasn't what I expected (even from a cheap monocular) due to excessive blurring on the edges. Not recommended."
2,Review and Help,"If anyone is able to help - it would be much appreciated. I've written the nursery twice to no avail.Here's the issue with the lemon tree:I purchased a Meyer Lemon Tree One Gallon by Monrovia Growers $39.98 tree about two months ago.The plant was doing fine outside. I have since brought the plant in the house and it is not doing well. I did everything I was told to do, plant food, soil, water, not near a vent, mist plant daily, etc., but it is not making a difference. I have the plant by a window with sunlight for most of the day.It gave me one blossom, but it withered and died within 2 days. The other buds have fallen off and leaves are falling off like crazy - new and dead leaves. The tree is almost to just a stick now.I'm at a loss."
2,Meyer Lemon Tree,"I purchased a Meyer Lemon Tree in September 2010 from Monrovia Growers, the plant had no buds and the trunk of the stem is not straight so when the plant gets larger I will have problems. Dissappointed."
4,Perfect little tree,"I got this tree as a gift in October and it came with 4 lemons! Since I'm in the Northeast, it's been indoors, in good soil and being misted regularly, but the leaves are browning and falling off. Meanwhile, my lemons are turning a lovely yellow and I will soon be picking them. I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm worried that without new sprouts forming and the leaves falling off that these will be the first and last lemons my little tree gives me."
3,"Came quick, but no blossoms yet","This came super fast, despite us living in a cold climate.I expected it to be a little more mature, as other reviewers mentioned it arriving with blossoms. Ours is pretty young, no blossoms yet, but it arrived alive and quickly, so I guess we'll just have to keep it alive for a year or so to get lemons."
2,Hopeful then Disappointed,"I bought two of the 1-gallon meyer lemon trees in December of 2010 for Christmas. The plants came packaged well which gave me hope. The plant did suffer from some shock, but after following the directions given to me it seemed to spring back. After about 3 weeks of having the tree it suddenly took a turn for the worse and has since died. I followed the directions but the tree never sprouted the entire time I owned it. The second tree that I bought as a gift came with a lemon already growing but not ripe. That tree faired even worse and the lemon never ripened and that tree also died. Perhaps I should have waited to buy the trees in a warmer season, OR, perhaps I should just learn my lesson and not buy trees through the internet."
1,Lemon Tree,The tree which was a present for my wife arrived pale and punie. I ppeares to want to die.FRED
2,Too Bad I had to throw them away.....,Wonderful trees....even had lemons on them.Soil had at least 3 baby cockroaches and other bugs. I wanted these as indoor trees but had to throw them away. Cockroaches are not to be messed with..oh well....
4,helpful with a little funny,Recieved product in good shape. not damaged in the mail. Was given as a gift and the reciever found it very helpful
4,Jenny McCarthy - Belly Laughs,Item seemed used. Wasn't indicated at time of purchase. But love this novel. It's very funny and I finished it in one day. Great pick-me-up whether or not you're pregnant.
1,HORRIBLE attitude about birth,"This woman is an idiot. She says her epidural was the most wonderful thing in the world and only an IDIOT wouldn't get one, and don't let anyone talk you out of an epidural! Then, within a couple paragraphs of getting her ""wonderful"" epidural, her baby is crashing and they have to do an emergency C-section. HELLO?!? Doesn't this idiot know that an epidural can cause fetal distress and increase your chances of c-section significantly? No, I don't think she does, but meanwhile instead of educating her readers, she is steering them toward the same problems she had. And she goes on to NOT breastfeed, not because she tried and had problems, but because she is selfish and didn't even try at all. What a trashy, ill-informed, poor example of a woman."
1,one star is even too much,Please please please Jenny STOP writing! Your style is AWEFUL for one... And you are misleading women into thinking pregnancy and birth is terrible... and painful. You didn't give birth you had surgery! This book is STUPID. don't spend your money.I felt offended when you said: epidurals why anyone would'nt get one? Do you get it now? You ended up with a C section and a blue baby! and not breastfeeding? You'd rather give COW milk to your baby (that you say you LOVE) then mommy milk... give me a break and get OUT!T.
1,I feel sorry for Jenny McCarthy,"I received this book as a gift and literally threw in the trash when I made it through. I really feel sorry for Jenny McCarthy. She had a ""tough pregnancy and labor"" .. much of which was of her own creation. Going and getting her hair blown out when she went into labor so that she looked good for pictures just shows where her head was. I would not recommend this book for anyone hoping for a natural childbirth, breastfeeding, etc. You will probably find that you don't relate with much that she says."
2,Very Disappointing :(,I watched Jenny on all the talk shows promoting this book and I couldn't wait to read it. She made it sound so funny.The book was a real disappointment.I think it would have been funnier if she used a real time frame.I think Jenny was on the right track with her honesty but it was poorly written.Her stories were funny when she would talk about them on TV. The book just didn't bring them to life.I guess I was expecting a little more.
1,as crass and stupid as can be,Jenny McCarthy or the triumph of vulgarity... Poor baby... Poor child of hers... to have such a nothing as a mother. It makes one really want to throw up to see how many people support such junk and thus reward it. Probably because she is a reflection of their own mediocrity and low-mindedness? Has humanity fallen so low? Really sad - and evil. Let's bare the naked truth indeed.
1,Crude yes Funny No,"If you have a spiritual bone in your body, skip this book. About what you would expect from a Playmate. I read the book anyway because the reviews were all so positive and I figured impending motherhood had softened her. The book was offensive particularly when she thanked the Lord for giving her better orgasms during pregnancy."
2,Just ok,"I did not like this too much. In pretty much every chapter she bashes her (ex)husband, and I could not find anything in this book that I could not read anywhere else."
5,Very Funnny!,This book takes an honest look at pregnancy with plenty of humor thrown in. I felt like Jenny was a friend telling me the points on being preggers that no one else would. Will for sure pass on to my friends!!
2,Over the top,"I like Jenny McCarthy and was looking forward to reading this book. However, I was disappointed that she portrayed herself as a total mess. Plus, some of the stories didn't come across as believable. It just seemed like she was over-exaggerating actual stories or well, she really is a total mess. All pregnant women are not insane!"
3,Eh it was alright.,After hearing so many great things I was looking forward to reading it. It was a too quick of a read and I was just let down. The chapters were brief and mostly predictable (it only took all of 2 hours to read). Yes there were a few funny parts but I should have saved myself the 10 bucks and taken my girlfriends who have already been pregnant out for a drink and soak up some of their anecdotes of the joys of pregnancy. I will say it's comforting to read that even celebs feel the painful side of pregnancy and I appreciated Jenny's honesty!
2,Just not very funny,"Because I find Jenny McCarthy funny I expected this book to be really funny too. Sure, some might find it gross or funny as she describes things like sex and hemorrhoids, but where was the actual humor? Where was the wit and the funny writing? It read more like a description of events. Plus, it is so short and such a fast read it just left me disappointed."
5,The best book ever!!!,"I am not the typical book reader, it takes alot to keep me interested in a book. Jenny is funny, honest and a little graphic while writing this book. I read the whole thing in a couple of hours without putting it down once! If you are offended by cuss words, its not for you, otherwise if you are prego or know someone who is....buy it for yourself or them."
1,"Not funny, full of negativity, and badly written","Hmmm... I picked this book up from the clearance table at the bookstore and sat down and read it while drinking some coffee. About the time I finished my coffee, I finished the book. It's very short and just not very well written, and I agree with other reviewers that the editing is severely lacking. I'm not a big Jenny fan, but I really thought I might laugh once while reading this book, but I didn't. My main reaction to it was pity. When I read the part about ""psycho chick"", I felt really bad for her that she had such an insensitive husband. And her reactions to her pregnancy problems made it seem like she just wasn't prepared for pregnancy. But the main problem I had with the book was the negativity, I wouldn't recommend anyone read this book, but I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is pregnant for the first time or hasn't been pregnant. She makes pregnancy sound like a horror show."
1,"Not funny, just stupid",I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be funny but instead it was just stupid. Each chapter is a short collection of thoughts where she recalls some story about either a dumb blonde moment related to pregnancy or some common pregnancy side-effect like having to pee frequently and her dumb blonde way of reacting to it. I couldn't relate at all. The humor is very childish at best. I regret the 20 minutes it took me to skim through this shallow book before tossing it.
1,Meh,"I thought this book would be cute and funny, which it was. However, by the end, I was starting to become really annoyed with McCarthy's lack of any knowledge or planning when it came time to deliver. It was not cute how she handled things and maybe she's not unlike many other first time mothers, but it was irritating to read about anyway."
2,Negative and not funny.,I read it when I was pregnant but I wish I hadn't. The author describes everything that went wrong with her pregnancy and you feel sorry for her. The problem is that it might seem that every pregnancy sucks just like hers. But it doesn't. Some women have very few problems and are overjoyed by carrying their child in their womb. If you want a funny book with some more perspective I recommend this new release:Bumptabulous: 20 Moms Expose PregnancyHere you have 20 stories and these are really funny. Also the book is very well structured - not just a mess of random thoughts. Sorry Jenny.
4,A Perfect Title!,"This book's title is RIGHT ON! I laughed throughout this book and feel MUCH better about the trials, tribulations, and joys of being pregnant now."
5,This is book is sooooo funny!,This book was so hilarious! She definitely tells is how it is. If you want to know what is involved with having a child this is definitely the book to get.
5,"Absolutely, hilariously wonderful!","This book was the best thing I have gotten throughout my pregnancy so far! I am beginning my 6 month with my first child, and this was exactly what I needed! I have experienced some of the things she talks about, and now prepared for more. I laughed out loud while reading this book, which I NEVER do! I highly recommend this book to everyone who is pregnant, has been pregnant, or is thinking about pregnancy. Everyone just needs a good laugh sometimes!"
3,take it or leave it,My sister in law bought me this book because people told her it was soooo funny. But I wasn't really that impressed. It was funny but I wasn't laughing at loud or anything. Probably not a book I would read again or buy as a gift for anyone else.
2,a little too fluffy,"A colleague of mine loved this book and is recommending it to everyone who is pregnant, so I thought I would give it a try. I have to agree with many other reviews that it is too whiny and has hardly any substance. I found quite a few spots amusing, but this under 2 hour read left me feeling like I hadn't learned anything. It felt like each chapter should have been a cutesy caption to a photo."
3,Lighthearted Fun on Pregnancy,"Jenny McCarthy is definately herself in this book, all her craziness and personality really comes across. She is crude, fun and real -and she knows it.Her take on pregnancy is an insight into real problems that affect mommies-to-be. I am planning on having a baby and will have to read this book again when I finally get a bun in the oven. Its a short read, btw, and is totally worth it. Give it a try and you'll be laughing and smiling for a few hours."
2,"Has some funny parts, but not great as a whole","I am pregnant with my second child and have approached my pregnancies with humor, but this book is just gross. I have always thought Jenny was funny, if a little obnoxious. Although somewhat truthful, I just felt she was trying too hard."
1,Never-ending Rant,Imagine striking up a conversation with someone about pregnancy and they proceed to complain about every detail of their pregnancy for three hours straight. That's what this book is. I had hoped for a good laugh but unfortunately I didn't get it.
1,Waste of time.,"This book was not funny at all, and not worth the 45 minutes it took to read it. Just dont bother with it. The content feels scattered, put together in random chuncks that dont really mesh together, and its so negative! Its like she decided to sit down every day and write three paragraphs about something she hated in her pregnancy, then throw in a foul or two word to make it ""funny"". I wasnt even slightly ammused... Im not sure why they even would think it would be funny? Its crass and negative. And not even crass and negative enough to be really ""nasty""! Each chapter is super short, divided by about a bunch of blank space in between. You can read this book in one stint at your doctors waiting room."
1,Ridiculous,"First, let me say that I love Jenny McCarthy, so no negative bias there. The writing is not great, she tries to be funny when she doesn't need to. I curse up a storm, so I'm not offended at the cursing, but it just doesn't fit well in this book. You'll learn nothing helpful from this book for your pregnancy other than some mildly funny anecdotes. Not recommended."
5,Good Book for Everyone,Ended up reading this book out loud to members of my family because it was hysterical and true.
5,THANK GOD FOR JENNY!,"I loved this book. I also read ""Baby Laughs"". What a quick, light-hearted read. I was laughing so hard that I would have to recite certain passages to my husband because they were just too funny.I would read anything she wrote based on this book and the other that I have read by her!"
5,a fun and informative read,"let me just say that jenny maccarthy is a genius. she tells the good, the bad and the ugly in this book and leaves nothing to the imagination but does it in such a way to keep you laughing the whole way through. this book is not for the meek and mild, the shy or the easily offended. it is graphic and slightly off color at times, but it's real and written from the perspective of a woman who has been through it all herself instead of a doctor who just tells you the clinical stuff. i recommend this book for most expectant mothers, their best friends, their sisters, their husbands...whomever needs to know what's really going on during pregnancy."
2,"Light reading, not a lot of information","If you're looking to get informed about pregnancy and childbirth, definitely don't read this book. It's a short, light read, but it really contains no useful information. Yes, Jenny is funny at times, but she drums the fact that she's a ""celebrity"" into our heads and generally does act like a dumb blonde (getting your hair blow dried when you're in labor - I mean, come one!). I didn't get a lot out of this book, but I did read it in one sitting."
3,A fun light reading. About Belly Laughs,"I had big expectations for this book, I red the preview pages and it was hilarous. However when I got the book I was kind of sad that it had very few pages with a big font, there are like 3 pages per chapter and the contents even though very funny lacked of some conclusion.It is great for light reading, it wont take you more than 2 days to read. It is funny and if you are pregnant I'm sure you can relate to it."
5,So True!,"I read this after I had my baby, but boy did it ring true. Jenny McCarthy says what all of us think about pregnancy, but wouldn't say. I am definitely going to give this as a baby shower gift to all of my friends."
4,Must Read,"this book says it as it is. if you are trying to concieve this is a book that will give you the facts straight without the relish on top. i was shocked at times, since i found out many things about pregnancy not shared in the public but all in all i am glad that i read it as i now know what to exactly expect when im expecting. Its a light informative book that u can finish in a couple of hours and its a good start up book about conceiving and pregnancy.i didnt give it 5 stars because of the chapters progression and not because of the facts stated."
3,Whiney and a True fast read,"I recieved this book for mothers day and read it in 1 and a half hours. I am not a book junkie by any means! It was very light, and that may be good for some people. I feel Jenny McCarthy is TRUE to her words in the book about some things... She Whines Alot! and some people may not appreciate her &amp;quot;straight forward&amp;quot; approach. Vulgar at times, but I still had a laugh here and there. So for 18 dollars you buy a book you will enjoy it for maybe a day. and a few good laughs, overall she made me more sick then pregnancy does already. You be the judge!"
4,Good book,"I just finished reading this book and i really enjoyed it because it tells you what is going to happen to you during pregnancy but with a funny spin to it. And it is always nice to know what your not going through this stuff alone, and celebrities are just like us and it takes a lot to open up so much in a book. i really enjoyed it!"
2,Not what I had hoped for...,"First, let me say that I am a big Jenny fan... I don't mind profanity and have a basket-full of pregnancy complaints... with all that in mind, I was truly disappointed with this book. It just wasn't that funny. It is very simply written... each chapter consists of (at most) 3 pages with very bold print. It's very overpriced for what you get.I would recommend going to Barnes and Noble or Borders and reading the entire book there while drinking some fancy decaf drink. It should take you a half an hour at the most and even with the outrageous cost of starbucks coffee drinks -- you will STILL have saved money.Otherwise, go with the ""Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" instead which ironically was also written by a former ex-playboy model who lives in LA. It's infinately better written."
2,Bad Experience,I thought this book didn't have any amusement what so ever. If anything this would make a person very nervous about the whole miracle of life. She had a bad pregnancy accompanied by a hard birth. I would not read any of her other books as it would make me want to crawl under a rock and cry for what will life with a child bring next. Maybe being with Jim Carey has helped her in her life since her husband didn't seem to be much of a man but more of thorn in her side on top of all her pains an mood swings.
1,Low self esteem and hideous pregnant women,"I truly thought this would be a funny book. I wasn't laughing when she went on about how hideous her private parts and body were in general she seemed to think when women are pregnant they resemble pigs with ""blue twinkles"". Sad, I think being pregnant is beautiful and I might add there is no blue twinkles. The labor and delivery experience she had was terrifying. If you want to read a realistic book about the joys of pregnancy with some funny undertones about being sick, gaining weight, etc. forget this book. I felt worse after reading, mostly for her."
2,Kind of graphic,"I read this book after it being recommended by a couple of people. Most of the information I had heard from other informative books, and some details and chapters I thought crude and don't agree with as far as sexual practices go. I am sure some people find it funny, but I will not be recommending it."
4,Super Funny! Kinda Short....,"This is a really funny book, but not very big. I wish it was a little longer. I finished it in one sitting. But it was a great read for a chuckle! And if you know someone who is really unprepared for pregnancy, then this is a great book to give them. Jenny's stories are super funny and very down-to-earth."
4,Belly Laughs if Full of Laughs,"I would start by saying the only negative thing is that the book isn't that long. I read it in one sitting at the park. McCarthy does an excellent job of telling it like it is and not holding back. If you're pregnant, considering it, a parent and are looking to laugh out loud this book is for you."
3,Entertaining,"The book was entertaining and I read through it in one sitting. The book doesn't contain anything that many of us haven't all heard before, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I might not have enjoyed it so much if my biological clock wasn't ticking so much=)"
5,Jenny gives you the truth about what to expect during pregnancy,This book was so funny but also insightful on what to really expect when you're pregnant. She gives intimate details that you don't read about in other pregnancy books. She gives you all the gross details that you secretly want to know.
5,Hilarious...read in 3 hours.,I read this in a few short hours. It is crass and brutally honest. I wanted honestly though...I wanted to hear about what it would be like. Now I feel the wool won't have been pulled completely over my eyes. Jenny McCarthy is so funny and so frank. We need more people like her....
3,Stars Lost,"I would rate the book five stars because it is so well written and funny, but I was terribly disappointed in the amount of profanity in it. I would LOVE to give it to my daughter who is expecting twins, but I know she would be terribly put off by the profanity used so profusely throughout the book. It is too bad, because otherwise I think she'd really enjoy Jenny's writing style. Just as so many films put out these days, if the profanity were eliminated, the story would be just as good, maybe even better. The profanity does nothing to enhance it. I give her three instead of five stars because of her language."
2,Maybe You Have To Be Pregnant?,"I LOVE Jenny McCarthy.I read a TON. Anything and everything.I've been looking forward to this book coming out for a while and I bought it the moment it did. I DO appreciate her honesty, as always! How many playboy models would be this THIS brutally honest about the disgusting truths of pregnancy!? You just have to love her for that. But the writing leaves a lot to be desired. It's short, choppy and jumps all over in regards to a timeline.If you are pregnant and suffering you may enjoy relating to her experiences but I wouldn't suggest it for anyone else for casual reading pleasure or even just a good laugh...Sorry Jenny! Still love you!"
1,Only Good if you Enjoy Toilet Humor,"This book was chock full of curses and poop humor. I think the ""shock value"" was mainly to cover the horrible writing. Don't waste your money."
3,I laughed a few times,"Some of it is exaggerated which doesn't add to the book. Some of it was funny. I guess I'm glad I read it, but I wouldn't suggest it to any of my pregnant friends. I'd just tell them funny stories about my own pregnancy that are way funnier :)."
1,Spoiled little Celebrity book,"TERRIBLE!!! I am so sad that my friend wasted money on this book. It was not funny, it was not educational and just made me very sad for those who see pregnancy this way.Basically it comes off like listening to a whiney, spoiled child tell you how hard it is not to be perfect and skinny, with perky boobs, because she is pregnant. Forget the kid she is growing, it's way more about worrying about getting a big butt and not looking ""perfect"" in front of cameras. YAWN!If you want a boring read, about a superficial woman pick this up, otherwise get any other book then this!!!"
2,Not Too Funny,"I couldn't wait for this book to be released. It looked so funny! Well, I gave it two stars for several reasons.1) The swearing was a little hard to take. I had read about that in other reviews, but I still didn't care for it. Call me a prude if you like...2)It just wasn't ""laugh out loud"" funny. Maybe I had seen too much hype. You know how sometimes things just don't stack up. There was one part where I sort of chuckled, but that was about it.3) I LOVE being pregnant. After years of trying and 4 miscarriages, every pregnancy symptom is a huge blessing. Yeah, they can been a pain (literally), but this made it sound like torture. For me, at least, it's not.I will say the ending of the book made earned some big points. I wish the entire book could have been written in that endearing style.Since it looks like I'm the only one not in love with this book, let the slamming begin..."
4,It was okay,"It was okay. It was funny but a no-brainer. Chapters were short and sweet. It was very easy reading but you can't take what she says seriously. It's not a must have pregnancy book, but it's good to give to a friend who's pregnant. It lets you realize ""you are not the only one this is happening to."""
4,A nice change of pace...,"I bought this book seeking something other than the typical ""What to expect when you're expecting"", and that's exactly what I got. I am a sarcastic, slightly cynical person... this book was perfect for me. Jenny McCarthy is straight to the point, and shockingly honest. The book is sincere, but with the comedy edge that makes it less cheesy than most pregnancy books."
4,"Easy, fun read for parents-to-be","This book was great! My husband and I laughed the whole way through. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because while funny and lightly informative about some of the non-glamorous things that come with pregnancy, it doesn't contain a lot of information about these things. Obviously, it's meant to be light-hearted and not scientific or medical, just make sure (especially if you're a first time parent-to-be!) that you pair reading this with something that has the appropriate medical information."
3,Glad I can say I've read it now,"I bought this book because some of my girlfriends who have had babies have loved it. The ""chapters"" were all 2-3 pages each, and consisted of a short story by Jenny. I found her to be more annoying that amusing. Spoiler Alert: It was hard to sympathize with her anecdotes about constipation, cellulite & stretch marks when she repeatedly tells the reader that she couldn't stomach vegetables and ate whatever she wanted. I really wanted to like this book!"
4,The honest truth,"Gotta love Jenny McCarthy. She tells it like it is. It's an easy read and gives you the low down of what you can expect. A much easier and quicker read than fumbling with ""What to Expect"" but it's a different genre. I recommend for anyone who has just found out they're pregnant."
1,stupid,"she's just over dramatic about every aspect of pregnancy. I didn't learn anything from this book. Judging by how she treated her husband according to this book, Im not surprised she is now divorced."
3,"A very quick, fun read but not that specific",Could have been more informative on which trimester she experienced specific things and how she remendied them. don't pay full price.
5,I absolutely love this book!,"When I was pregnant with my daughter, Jenny McCarthy made me feel SO much better. And, I loved that the chapters were so short because I had no attention span. I highly recommend this for any woman who's expecting....."
4,Belly Laughs,Hilarious book. Jenny McCarthy lets all all the gross yet humourous details of how she felt while she was pregnant - no holding back. I would definately reccommend this book - also it is easy reading.
4,Exactly what I expected!,"The seller was great! I got my book fast and in excellent condition! It was exactly what I expected from Jenny McCarthy, something to make me laugh about the not so fun parts of pregnancy and an easy and short read for my husband to understand what I'm going through."
2,It was OK,"I find Jenny McCarthy hilarious. This book did have a few funny parts but as for any actual information it lacked a lot. I actually read this on my kindle and finished it within one night of reading. WOW! I didn't realize it was so short. The writing is not great, it reads more like a Cosmo magazine article, which generally I would have no problem with but it got a little old after a while. So just FYI, if your looking for a quick (I mean very quick) laugh then go ahead and borrow it from someone. I wouldn't buy it."
3,"easy read, and addictive","I liked this book at first and then felt a little like I was reading a Dr. Seuss book. It is good and true, but way too short on details. A lot of people are easily offended and put off frankness, often interpreting honesty as vulgarity. I, on the other hand, want every little piece of info. I want more than a couple pages that really amount to notes. If you like to laugh it is really funny, I even cried at the end(I'm pregnant). I read it in a couple days and wished it had more... She is good at making things ""normal"" that most women want to keep as ""too much Info"". I can't understand after all these years of revolutionary technology and the internet, women can still want everything to be so prude. I got this as a gift, and I would certainly buy it for anyone who is a hypochondriac, a neurotic, or a curmudgeon!"
4,belly laughs review,"For starters Jenny McCarthy and I have similar crude personalities and I have always been able to relate to her humor. I am relieved to read the experiences that she had during her pregnancy, and comforted that I am not the first to feel all of these strange things in pregnancy. Insightful, informative and an easy read."
4,Easy read,Easy and quick read. I thought it was going to be better. Yet I would still recommend it because it has some good information presented within those funny stories.
3,Novel...,This was more of a funny read rather than an informational book. It was a quick read. Don't over pay - buy a used version!
5,hillarious!!!!,"This book is hillarious! Bought for myself, bought it for shower gifts, lent it to friends......it is funny. It doesn't take long to read and I am not a reader. I liked it! It was light and funny and didn't take a month to read. :) Get it!"
5,A Must-have,"Bought this as a gift and my sister loved it instantly. Been told by numerous people how great it was, and even though I don't need it personally, it was great to get some insight on what is going on. Now the book will be making the rounds with our pregnant friends..."
4,Thank you Jenny!,I am glad that someone who truly has a sense of humor and is funny wrote this book it wouldn't have been right coming from anyone else. Each chapter was like a chapter from my own pregnancy. I couldn't put it down a light read that I couldn't get enough of I am definitely going to purchase life laughs and baby laughs.
5,A great way to start your pregnancy!,I read this at the beginning of my pregnancy and I laughed and laughed. Most books you are going to read are a little boring to me but this was an HONEST account of everything that you may go through. I would recommend this to anyone expecting.
5,"Hilarious, but scary...","Great book....but now I'm really worried about what I got myself into. Hopefully, I can handle this with as much humor as Jenny instilled in her book."
4,Funny and true,"The women who gave this book negative reviews need to lighten up! It's obvious they take it all way too seriously, and face it; pregnancy has many aspects that are unpleasant (to put it mildly) and I only wish I'd had had something half as funny to read when I was pregnant! All I ever heard was how great pregnancy was supposed to be, and how I was creating life and blah blah blah...my experience was closer to Jenny's and quite frankly it's good to take a lighter view of the whole process. I have four children and I love them more than life itself, but let's face it, pregnacy is not pleasant or fun or glorious for ALOT of women and it's good to be able to laugh about it for a change!My advice, read this book for a good laugh, but for real information get What to expect when you're expecting, or something a little more informational...."
3,Fun - but needs more info,Belly Laughs is a fun read - don't get me wrong. Just it is more a personal account of Jenny McCarthy's experience of being pregnant then of pregnancy in general. I don't know about other woman - but I am not a super start that is usually a size 4 who has to worry hosting a nationally board cast TV show while pregnant. That aside it does offer many tidbits of good info for a first time pregnant woman. I would be sure to get other books to go along with this one though for your reading pile.
5,Just what you need,"When all the other books are stressing you out, this is the one that makes you laugh."
4,"Not very scientific, but very funny!","This is a quick read that will provide a lot of laughs. Jenny does a great job of poking fun of the strange changes your body will experience as a result of pregnancy. I learned about some things that I have yet to experience, and could relate to those that I've already encountered. The book's chapters are short, only a few pages, and cover a myriad of topics - making it easy to put down and pick back up again. I wouldn't use this as your go-to pregnancy guide by any means. But it would make a fun gift for a newly pregnant person or a good pick-me-up for those of us who are well on our way."
4,true and funny,"The book was pretty accurate, although I thought she left a few details out, but obviously she couldn't write about things she did not experience. She was blunt and funny in her explanation of what women go through during their pregnancy. A more girlfriend to girlfriend approach. I wish I had known about the book while I was pregnant."
2,Mildly entertaining,"This book was mildly entertaining, but I wish I hadn't read it. Her husband sounds like a jerk and she sounds vapid, vain, and shallow. I'm turning my attention to more positive books from wise women, like something by Ina May Gaskin."
1,"Funny, but no useful information, some of it outright WRONG","If you want a well thought out book complete with references that has some humor in it, this isn't your book.It has very little in the way of useful information, much of it is ludicrous. It's funny, yes, but she is NOT who you want to be getting your information from. Really, it's only value is that of entertainment."
4,Short but sweet and informative,"This was recommended to me by a friend as a light-hearted, funny and realistic point of view about being pregnant and that is exactly what it was. It made me laugh and relaxed me a little about some of the things I was worried about. I was surprised that I got through it in one sitting and actually wished it was longer but I liked every bit of it."
3,Was cute,I thought the book was funny and pretty right on for most pregnancy related things that us women go through.
2,Glad I borrowed from the library,"I remember hearing about this book when it came out and thinking I wanted to read it when I was pregnant. Well, when I did get pregnant, I started researching the best pregnancy books to buy and remembered this one. Based on some of the negative reviews' suggestions, I borrowed it from the library, and am glad I did.1) It's very, very short. You will read it in a few hours.2) Parts are mildly funny, but nothing to make you laugh out loud.3) She does not go into certain details - why did she wants CVS, even though she was under 35? Why did she choose not to breastfeed?4) I wanted to read this book for the uncensored, ""tell it how it is,"" approach to pregnancy. I found ""The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy"" far more useful."
2,Expected more,"This book was really short and just had two pages at best on each pregnancy issue. While some stuff was funny and informative, I didn't roll over laughing, nor was I impressed with her outrageousness. I didn't think it was so bold or something that women are afraid to talk about. I guess I just had expected more. Quick easy read."
5,This is a must have!,"My husband and I were informed of this book by a friend. We had to check it out. We read it together, laughed and cried together. It was very informative and just a GREAT read in general. We couldn't put it down until we finished. We are so glad we got this one. This is a must have! Thanks so much Jenny. Can't wait for the next one!"
4,Refreshing read for pregnant ladies!,A must-read for all pregnant ladies that are not easily offended! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was so short!
5,LMAO so funny,"This book took me 4 hours to read. It's so funny i dont remember laughing so hard! Although it made me not wanna have children.. EVER! it was good to know though, all the stuff that jenny went through being pregnant."
5,Must have book for first pregnancy,"I was apprehensive to buy a book written by Jenny McCarthy but I did and it's great. It is short, but tells you all the gross details of pregnancy and labor that nobody speaks of. Highly recommended."
3,"Belly Laughs, funny but not as funny as I hoped","This was a cute read, but I am glad I bought it on sale. It isn't worth the full price. It is a short read with some laughs."
3,Good for a chuckle,"This is not the book for you if you want black/white medical information. However... if you want a light hearted read that seems like it came from one of your girlfriends, then pick this up! Be prepared for the Jenny mcCarthy unabridged descriptions of gas and other not so charming pregnancy symptoms. Fun read that you breeze through quickly."
2,Popular only because she's famous,"This book is funny. However, it doesn't contain anything enlightening at all. It is a collection of things that every mother already knows and every newly pregnant woman might be scared of. If you're reading this book to see how Jenny did it and compare yourself, I urge you not to model your pregnancy after hers, she clearly had no clue what was going on."
3,Belly Laughs,Belly Laughs was a very easy read. It was funny and I felt like I could connect with Jenny. It didn't provide a lot of information more about what she went through but it was helpful b/c I went through the same things.
5,I throughly enjoyed it.,"Great for women who want to know what could happen to you and your body during pregnancy. I personally have never been pregnant, but am considering it. This book has been a little insight into what I can expect. Thank you Jenny."
3,Too much hype,"Everyone told me how hilarious this book was. I got a couple laughs out of it and it was a quick read, but nothing special. I would buy a super used one at the cheapest price."
5,Funny!,"I read this book in like an hour and half. I started to read it late around 3am (Insomnia) and I couldn't put it down til I finished it. I was shocked at so many things I didn't know but she delivers it in ""my language!"" Love it! I am getting my husband to read it."
3,"Crass, Cute, Mostly Lives Up to Description","I didn't just read this book in one night-- I read it in about two hours. It's really short, particularly because most of the ""chapters"" are about two pages long. I laughed out loud twice toward the beginning, then just grinned from time to time as I got used to the humor.It suffers in editing and proofreading, however. I'm surprised the publisher missed the many grammatical errors throughout the book (two on page 58 alone), and chose to let Jenny commit exclamation mark and CAPITAL LETTER abuse (!!!). There were many clever spots, but it read too much like a first draft to me, and made me wonder if they were rushing a publication schedule.Enjoyable nonetheless, provided you're not horrified by profanity and bodily functions."
1,Wow,Ummm shocked anyone reads this nonsense. This stuff is a big reason I'm not getting married or conceiving a child with an American women. I will adopt before I pay someone selfish to pretend to be a good parent. Where is the child's father? Why she need to call out Jim Carey? Autism spokesman... Simply disgusting
3,Funny but disappointing,"I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I was expecting more of a cohesive book, instead of a collection of mini pregnancy rants. Yeah, there is some really funny stuff, and that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 2, but it just left me feeling like, ""Eh, that's it?"""
4,Very Cute,"Jenny McCarthy's ""Belly Laughs"" is nothing short of adorable. I am currently expecting my second child, and picked up this book after hearing several positive reviews from other expectant mothers. McCarthy is straight-forward and honest about the joys and tribulations of pregnancies without ever losing her sense of humor. She makes several ""taboo"" subjects approachable, and in the face of so many books aimed at ""scaring"" pregnant women into doing things a certain way, McCarthy gives readers the bare facts while reassuring them that they can handle anything mother nature throws at them. Even if they don't agree with some of her choices, McCarthy's experiences will amuse and reassure her audience - especially those expecting their first baby."
3,"Funny, but lacking substance","After reading Teresa Strassers ""Exploiting My Baby"" (which I HIGHLY recommend), I was looking to find another fun pregnancy book. I ordered this one and was excited to read it.I flew through it, and like many other readers, had many moments of laughing out loud. It was really funny, but at the same time it was lacking in substance. I never really felt connected to her struggles, and felt more often that they were maybe a bit over-inflated and exaggerated.It was funny, but overall it just felt like Jenny was trying too hard.I recommend Teresa's book over this one, for sure. You'll laugh out loud, but for different reasons...it's more of a ""smart"" funny book, whereas this one just isn't."
2,Not for me,"I expected this book to be funny and to have substance. Unfortunately, there wasn't enough substance for me. I didn't learn anything new and the advice wasn't very helpful. On the positive side, it was a light quick read and a nice break from other maternity books."
3,It's an alright book,"Based on the high rating it received, I expected this book to be over the top hilarious, and able to provide first-hand info about what to expect in pregnancy. I was really disappointed. Most of the time, it didn't come across as funny, just like endless complaining. Each of the chapters (except the last one) is only 2.5 or so pages long. That's barely enough time to say anything. For example, for the ""stretch marks"" chapter, it basically consisted of: ""Every woman fears stretch marks. I got them on my butt and boobs, not my belly. If you got stretch marks in puberty, you'll likely get them now. Nothing is proven to work at preventing/fixing them. Sorry."" Needless to say, I'll be selling this book back, if anyone wants to buy it still."
4,"Lighthearted, fast read.","I read this in a couple days while pregnant with my first. It was pretty funny, with lots of preggo details that are short and to the point, in the typical Jenny McCarthy fashion. I would recommend this book to friends that want a quick, funny pregnancy read and don't mind cursing. This is not a very informative book, but instead is like a blog of one woman's pregnancy experience."
2,Could have skipped this purchase,"Yes it is funny, but other than her adult sense of humor I feel like Im reading a little kid book! The print is huge and some chapters are only 2 or 3 pages long. Don't get this book if you are looking for anything informative. She doesn't tell you anything that you would not hear in any other book, she just has a more graphic or explicit description. Its like reading the sunday comics....could probably finish it in 30 minutes and you wont care to remember any of it the next day."
2,Disappointing and not very funny,"2 stars instead of one cause Jenny is sarcastic and swears a lot, girl after my own heart.That said, I found this book to be just so, so sad. I understand that her anti-natural every aspect of childbirth is her choice, but I really feel that as a woman with a platform and resources, she has a duty to educate herself and encourage other women to do the same. It came as no surprise to me she ended up having a panic driven c-section at the end. These are HER experiences, but they in no way resemble that of ""normal"" pregnancy. Yes pregnancy can suck a s*** ton, but there was just so much unnecessary and preventable drama in Jenny's. This should not be the standard experience marketed as the ""naked truth.""There are no pearls of wisdom in this book and nothing that ""people won't tell you."" It's no secret pregnant women get gas, hemorrhoids, are hormonal, crave foods, poop with an epidural, tear during birth etc."
5,love this book,I ordered this book for a friend because I had read it when I was pregnant with my now 7 year old. It was so funny
3,Meh,Wasn't particularly cute or funny. Laughed a couple of times and some was informative but I don't know that I'd recommend it.
5,Hysterical Truths,"Jenny McCarthy is hilarious and honest. I loved the approach she took. It is an informational book, giving you a heads up on what to expect and look for, but takes some of the fear out of pregnancy and childbirth. I don't read a lot of pregnancy books because I feel like I'm being talked down to, making me feel completely inadequate and totally scared. This book was not so. Fantastic read, I was laughing from start to finish."
4,Everyone who I buy this book for LOVES IT,I rated 4 stars b/c I haven't read it yet but everyone who I send it to loves it & is laughing & says they read it in 1-2 days or less!!
1,Painfully unfunny - hated it,"I thought this would be funny, as I've seen Jenny McCarthy on a few different tv shows, but was really disappointed. She comes across as a spoiled celebrity who finds almost everything about pregnancy and childbirth to be icky and worth whining about. Don't waste your money... get ""The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy"" instead, as that's a humorous look at the reality of pregnancy through the eyes of someone who can see both the good and the bad."
1,sad,I do not reccommend this book because she doesnt speak of an empowering or even educated birth experience but a rather uneducated and sadly disempowering birth. I believe pregnancy is a time for good birth stories and being educated on whats best for mother and baby. Sadly she discusses how much she loved her epidural and winking at the anstesiaologist to up her epidural not moving or doing a thing in labor and ultimately getting her babies head suctioned and then recieving an unnecessary ceserean section....would never reccomend this
5,8.75 months pregnant - and really needed this,"I saw Jenny McCarthy on a talk show yesterday and bought the book after my doctor's appointment later in the day. My doctor told me that I am ""ripe"" so I thought I deserved it. On the talk show - JM said she reads these comments - so I wanted to make sure I forwarded my message.I am 8.75 months pregnant and I am SO sick of the blah-blah-blah advice and overreaction of most pregnancy books that are available. I decided to truly entertain myself for a couple of days before my little bugger enters the world.JM - Thanks for writing a great book to take my mind away from the nervousness of expecting. Your sense of humor is hilarious - I could only imagine how funny it would be to chat with you over coffee or cocktails!Thanks!"
1,Whiny. Not entertaining.,"This book will either unnecessarily scare first time moms or make second-, third-, etc- time moms roll their eyes. McCarthy either had a complicated pregnancy or is a huge wuss. For women who have complications, I doubt they want them made light of. For everyone else, whining about every discomfort during pregnancy is not 'getting the truth out' - it's just showing how spoiled you are.Maybe it would be nice to eat an entire tray of brownies every night (she claims to have done this) but I personally don't have money for a personal live-in trainer to help me lose the extra 50 pounds I'd gain because of it. I had an ok pregnancy and I didn't eat whatever I felt like eating - actually, I'm told this approach is bad (GENERALLY you're supposed to only add 300 calories a day, 500 I think during the thrid trimester).If you're rich and/or spoiled, this book is totally for you."
1,a waste of time if it weren't because it's so short,"I found this book to be just plain silly. No helpful or insightful information at all, just a bunch of not-funny short descriptions of a woman's unpleasant experiences during pregnancy. Also, I find it hard to believe that she's been through everything she describes in the book. She makes pregnancy sound like a disgrace. Don't waste your time nor your 10 bucks on it."
5,"Hilarious, even if you don't like her media personality.","I received this book as a gift, and was leery before I read it as her TV personality and ""potty humor"" is not generally my style. However, when applied to pregnancy, I found it totally hilarious! It was laugh-out-loud funny to me, and I had to stop reading it in bed because I was keeping my poor husband awake. It's an outrageously plain-talking, unglamorous look at the things we women go through during pregnancy. It's definitely not for people without an open-minded sense of humor or the faint-hearted.By the way, my husband read it, too (although he didn't enjoy it quite as much as I did) and he learned a few things he didn't know about some of the ""less ladylike"" things he could expect to experience during the birth. I'm really glad he'll be more prepared now and that I didn't have to bring up the ""poo"" subject myself. :)"
5,Very funny book,"This is one of the funniest books I have ever read. I picked it up in the bookstore and my husband insisted we buy it because I was laughing so hard he could hear me 3 aisles over. High five to Jenny McCarthy for taking the taboo out of the dark side of pregnancy. Pregnancy might be 'about the baby', but its happening to my body. Jenny really helped me laugh about all the weird things it's doing to me."
5,Such a fun read!,This book is so honest and well written...it was a fun easy read and kept me laughing and entertained! :)
4,Quick Fun Read,"I enjoyed this book. Could have finished it in one day. Easy read, lots of laughs, good visuals. Great book that delivers some facts."
4,"Entertaining, easy read","If you're like me, a first time mom who was surprisingly unhappy during my pregnancy, you'll find this book comical and comforting. When all the other pregnant people I've known were too shy to share their embarrassing (yet totally scientifically normal) secrets of the dark side of pregnancy, Jenny McCarthy helped me realize it was all normal."
2,Nothing special,"Luckily this was a short read (under 2 hours) otherwise I would have been even more disappointed. I knew when I picked up this book that it wasn't going to change my life, but hoped I would be at least mildly amused. I am at 13 weeks and believe me, have really not enjoyed pregnancy so far and have plenty to complain about. That being said, I found this book to be whiny and completely uninformative. The things she complains about and how she seems to cope with things is over the top in my opinion. One reviewer said she glosses over important things like why she didn't breastfeed, and why she did the CVS test. These would have been interesting things for her to expound on, but we heard nothing more about it. This book was sloppily put together and obviously written in a hurry. I wouldn't recommend reading this book, but apparently I am in the minority, as it gets good reviews."
2,Definitely Not What I Thought It Would Be,"I purchased this book thinking it would be nice to read a more light hearted pregnancy book than books like ""What To Expect When You're Expecting"". While I wasn't really offended by her boldness, I was very turned off by the insensitivity her husband had towards her when she had hormonal outbursts, the fact that she talked so much about how ugly and fat pregnant woman become, and the fact that she chose to get her hair blown out while she was having contractions rather than get her butt to the doctor. What in the heck was wrong with her? I definitely won't be recommending this to anyone. (Though I really did like her ""instructions"" for daddys to be)"
3,It was pretty good,"I took this book to read on vacation and finished it in a few hours. It's a very easy read. Mildly entertaining. I didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. My pregnancy was the complete opposite of hers, maybe that's why."
5,Hilarious & Sooo True!,"I read this as a suggestion from my sister during my 4th month of pregnancy. I was in the ""easy"" part of my pregnancy, so I'll probably read it again in my 9th month so I can appreciate it a little more. Her chapters of various symptoms were absolutely hilarious & blunt. She has a way of describing what our bodies & minds go through in a way that is totally relatable. It may be a bit raunchy for some, but pregnancy isn't always pretty & she says it as it is. Dark nipples, dry heaving, bleeding gums, constipation, it's all in the book & it's all true!!! I've already given this book as part of a shower gift & will continue to do so in the future!"
2,Really stupid book-only kinda funny,"A first grader could read this book in one sitting. I was expecting some real stories about being pregnant. I bought this when I first got pregnant with my first baby. I read through it in one night. Her writing is too simple, and there isn't enough interest to call it a book. I thought it was a total waste of money. There were only a few parts that were actually funny. Buy this one second hand."
5,It had me in stiches!,THis book was sooo true to life. It had me in stitches! It left me feeling like I wasn't the only one experiencing the joys of pregnancy!
2,"Entertaining, but nothing special.","Let me begin this by saying that I've always found Jenny McCarthy funny.That aside, this book could have been so much better. Yes, it's refreshing to see a pregnancy book that discusses topics conveniently left out of most others. It just seemed like she threw the entire thing together in an afternoon. Or less. As I read each chapter, I kept hoping she would have written more or expanded on her experience.Overall, it was very disappointing. I expected much more from her. Maybe the next one will be better."
5,Roll On Floor Laugh Out Loud With Every Page,"Bring it on momma! I love this book even if it makes me run to the bathroom every few minutes. Being pregnant, at least over 7 months, makes most of us have to go to the potty frequently. Add a true Belly Laugh -- ok pun intended -- and we're sunk. Who cares...it's so funny, light hearted and a total must have for those of us who feel like fat dumpy cows who would like to be thin tanned hotties! It's a hoot! For more laugh out loud books or for a little more on tots to teens, my book club read, Don't Put Lipstick On the Cat, by Debbie Farmer, it's terribly funny with parenting tips too and Mommy-CEO, by Jodie Lynn, a book that leaves all moms going away with a different viewpoint on kids, life and WIFE. Laughing is the world's best medicine and these three books brings back memories to those of us that already have kids but are expecting again. If you believe in moms and the crazy life of motherhood, you'll love all three."
5,Are y'all sleeping on this like i was?,"I've been an Al Johnson fan for the longest time. Here he returns to the fold with the Unifics, and, well it's 4 a.m., they're singing his composition ""Long Way To Forever"", and quite frankly it's worth the price of the CD alone. Nighttime magic. Trust me, my smooth radar is always on, so I know a bad slow jam when I hear it. And (excuse starting the sentence with a conjunction) though I consider this to be the highlight of the CD, there are some real close seconds, ""Anyone Can Tell You"", ""My One And Only"", ""Victims Of 9/11"" to name a few. As an old song says ""Wake up Everybody!"""
3,Purchased before I knew they were made in China. :(,"As others have noted, the finish is very touchy--scratches easily. I would have preferred a Nordic Ware pan (made in America), but alas as of this review, they do not make one with removable bottoms.The size and shape of these pans are great for individual serving tarts. I have never baked in mine. I use them for making raw cheesecakes.I love the removable bottoms--makes removing tender pastries almost worry free.These come in a box. To protect the finish I plan to store them in their boxes. (I purchased more than one set.)I have rated this set at three stars due to the fragile nature of the finish. For the price, a higher quality finish would have been nice.They do what I want them to do. My caution to a buyer would be to baby the pans to protect the finish."
4,Good response time and great service,"It arrive in a timely manner and it was made well, as of yet I haven't used it so can not make a comment on its usability."
3,tartlet pan,"Received the product promptly; love the design of the tartlet pans with the removable bottoms and size of tartlets. However, the shipping was very pricey and the finish on the pan doesn't seem to be very durable. (Can't say for sure because I haven't used them yet, but I have a couple of scratches on them from washing them up?) I am still happy to have the pans because they are metal and not silicone."
2,Dissapointed,"For those of us who fell in love with ""Fabrications"" this proved to be a big let down! The cold sparse presentation was unrewarding. Some of the historical backround was informative. However, that was not my reason for purchasing the book and I will probably be returning it. Besides, I have always been under the impression that ""Country decor"" was what ever the individual made it to be."
5,How to Survive High School With Minimal Brain Damage,"This is a very funny book. Read only for humor intent. Not to be taken seriously....Although some of the ideas do work... Sorry, I won't tell you which ones. A perfect gift to anyone who was in high school in the '80's. It may be interesting to those who followed but not to be taken as fact."
2,A surprisingly weak book,"I have read many ...for Dummies books and bought the All in One for Excel, Access and FP2003 together. The FP2003 stood out as by far the weakest of the three.It gives short thrift to the mechanics of using the software and quickly drifts into programming techniques to avoid explaining how the software works. I bought the book to understand and use the many features of FP2003. I was disappointed.A waste of my money, and no doubt, a waste of yours."
4,All about front page,A comprehensive description and how to use Frontpage that goes beyond what I expected. Highly recommended.
5,Great Book!,I thought it was excellent. It had alot of helpful tips and has enticed me to buy other dummies books.
3,"Book Ok, but beware of recommendations",There are lots of tips and resources to make windows XP run faster and to clean the harddrive.Unfortunately one of the recommended programs for doing most of the things for you is System Mechanic (do not forget to read all the comments for this software in Amazon -at the moment 20 ratings with one star for the version 7- I wish I had read them prior to use it) which made my windows work worse than before and broke most of links of programs with the System Registry.Good Luck.
3,Latin Muscle takes a dive,"The rich landlord wants the tenants out, so he can tear the buildings down.He hire the brute as his thug to persuade the stubborn peopleto move. But his plots and that of his wife backfirewhen the brute turns out to be nicer and more attractive than anyonethought. The end is tragic and the movie is realistic as to the settingand costumes as there is a shot out at the end.I liked the movie, but it isn't the quality ofViridiana - Criterion Collectionby the same director even with better known actors and actresses."
4,Un bruto muy bueno,"Esta pelicula demuestra que Buñuel puede dirigir como sea, lo que sea. No es una de sus hobras maestras sino que es una palícula en la que se tiene que adaptar a un formato pleestablecido con muy poco espacio de maniobra y lo hace muy bien. La pelicula tiene buena trama, aunque un poco trillada. Se explora el lado del pobre que es sirviente de los ricos traicionadno sus origenes. Este tipo de personaje facinaban a Bueñuel (Mayordomos, curas, policias, mandaderos, etc). Es un filme que vale la pena verlo."
2,produced very poorly,I just bought the instant streaming version of this... and will prolly never complete it - simply because the vocal - where mike is screaming out the commands to his class... is about 4 times as loud as the music.... awful awful awful
2,bad camera angles,The camera angles are shot from the front - all upper body shots -Should be shot from behind and showing all of the body movements.Learning it backwards is tough - not seeing the steps makes it almost impossible-Disappointed - I was so excited to learn
5,The Swinger/ Mr. Swing,"This double CD is one of my top five favorites. As the album titles suggest, this is pure swing jazz at its best. Harry Edison is at his best, as are tenor sax man Jimmy Forest and pianist Jimmy Jones. Don't let the sticker price for this collection scare you - this is 5 star music."
3,Nice design but flawed surface,I love the overall design and underlying math/sacred geometry behind the design. But the surface had a few pits which did make the design a little confused. I still wear it but just be aware the surface might not be as polished smooth as in the picture.
4,Love Classic Poems,Love picking out a special poem for the holidays and sharing them with my family. This book is my go to book for those occasions!
1,Ruined by new Score,"I was stunned by the horrible new score to this film. I hadn't seen the film in years, and I kept thinking, ""Man, this music is terrible. Has it always been like this?"" It sounds like a cheesy Pulp Fiction ripoff, and has no relation to the drama that's on the screen. Scenes I knew I had been moved by years ago now had no emotional resonance at all, particularly the rumble. Wow. The new music literally ruined this film, and I cannot fathom why FFC wouldn't recognize that."
4,A low cost alternative,"I would have given this a 5-star rating except for the lousy packaging it came in. It came in a flimsy box and one end had punched through. It didn't come with the complete studs and bolts (may have fallen out of the hole in the box), so SAVE THE HARDWARE WHEN YOU DISMANTLE YOUR OLD MANIFOLD. Other than that, I have no gripes about the product. It fit just like OEM and installation was easy. I had a harder time removing the old manifold. Spray the rusted bolts with PB the night before. Best of all, no more check engine light. It's been in my Civic for a month now and so far so good. The engine is a little louder, but that's fine with me considering I just save a couple of hundred bucks."
5,Easy replacement!,Very easy replacement on my sons 98 Civic DX. Hundreds of $$'s cheaper than competition and it was at my door 2 days after order! Great shipper!!
4,Solid Movie,"This movie was low key on action, but the content and scenery were great. If you are looking for an interesting video, this is a good one to check out."
3,Like Most Things.... It Depends....,"If you are the sort of person who loves what is most recently referred to as the ""slow burn"" movie this movie may be for you. Though I felt the story is beat for beat fairly predictable, you may enjoy that in movies. This is not Jaws in the Jungle. It is the story of a loner who changes slightly - largely due to the overwhelming cuteness of the two kids he meets.If instead you are looking for an interesting tale of hunting - a bit more like The Ghost and the Darkness - this movie is probably going to drive you crazy with boredom.If you want a movie with some good acting, albeit lacking a little in story, Willem Dafoe, Frances O'Conner and Sam Neil are very good, but there is not that much to do in this story other than walk around the wilderness."
2,horror story,"I hate the ending of this movie so much I cannot overstate how much I hate the ending of this movie. The resolution of the story makes me feel like killing myself. Jesus, why? Why would you tell this story? And I like a lot of dark stories like Melancholia, a movie that made me feel bad but then afterwards really good. Cathartic release and beautiful images haunt the mind after a piece of art like that is experienced. But this ""The Hunter"" movie.. no. I wish he'd put the gun is his mouth and pulled the trigger.So, 2 stars for the acting, location and I don't know, I'm felling generous. Oh and the premise of the story is patiently absurd to begin with. The tiger can be used to make an awesome drug. Whatever. Overrated film."
2,Awful,"Just awful. Pointless movie. Is it a tree-hugger, anti-pharmaceutical company production? WHO KNOWS?! Just a pitiful, pointless, sorry excuse for entertainment...or even a lecture."
3,"Starts out well, sputters","This movie is well made. Good editing, good scenes, good acting. Poor story though. Especially the end as it doesn't really make any sense. Too bad about that."
2,Marginally watchable typical westener thinking and logic. Predictable,A little heavy handed. Did not buy Defoe in the role. Story seemed a little too simplistic. The psychological profile of Defoe's character was not consistent throughout to my mind. Defoe has the problem he seems to have in at least the majority of roles I've seen him portray. He seemed despise the character he plays.
1,Horrible Slow Paced Movie,"The movie moves at such a slow pace. I kept expecting a surprising turn, but never got it. The plot is fairly simple, and the movie just plods along. Wouldn't recommend it at all."
2,boooooooooooooooo,"This is a really drawn out film. while the scenery is great, and the story is vaguely interesting... it just doesn't ever truly peak your interest."
4,Enjoyable find,"Gorgeous cinematography and great musical score make up for a somewhat implausible story and shallow supporting character development. Defoe is fantastic and the story is interesting despite the simpleton ""towny"" characters and vague development of Sam Neil's character. The hunting scenes and buildup realistically depict the care and stealth required to stalk elusive game."
4,Worth the watchng,"William DaFoe as a modest yet confident man given a job of serching for an elusive creature in Australia. Amazon reviews of the flick were good when I was searching form something to watch, andI agree the rating is fitting, I enjoyed it and agreed with the outcome of the film."
2,Slow and depressing,"I am a big Willem Defoe fan and was excited to see this movie on the Prime list. However, this is a horribly depressing movie. There is little continuity throughout the movie and things just happen or appear without explanation. There are multiple ways to handle something and the characters always pick the most unintuitive move that simply makes no since.Willem Defoe was his usual self, excellent actor, but the movie left me wishing I had not watched it. I gave it 2 stars only because of Defoe, without him it is a 1 star."
2,Endlessly Waiting for Something to Happen,"I like Willem Dafoe as an actor, and so I decided to watch this movie, especially after seeing the decent reviews here on Amazon. It was one of the more boring movies I've ever watched, considering it was about a mercenary...a mercenary holding a gun on the jacket cover of the video. I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever happened. Sure, it was suspenseful...not because you were on the edge of your seating wondering what exciting thing was going to happen next. Oh no, it was only suspenseful in the sense that you were always waiting for something, ANYTHING even, to happen that was exciting. Nope, nothing exciting ever happens. The movie ended and I was still waiting. Don't waste your time."
2,disappointing and predictable,"Beautiful scenery, but the movie has an identity crisis in that in cant decide if it is a suspense mystery flick or a paean to the green movement. Highly unbelievable ending; the protagonist's (Dafoe) action does not at all square up with who his character is supposed to be; a predictable set-up: loggers evil, greenies good....this is just another sad tired meme against evil biotech pursuing scientific progress at the expense of nature. If i had known this was so predictably lame i wouldnt have wasted my time."
2,Painfully slow with tortured dialog and character development,"While this movie featured some fine acting talent in the form of DaFoe and Niell, and also had some remarkable shots of the Tasmanian wilderness, this movie failed on almost every level. The character development was non-existence, We are given no insight into the main characters or their inner demons. The dialog was crap, and that's being kind. The movie was as slow as molasses and that is being even kinder. This thing simply failed to engage me at every point.I think this movie had potential, but the execution was lousy. A re-worked story line and script could have pulled it together. With this kind of acting talent, a fine script could have made this movie sing, but instead we were treated to little more than one trap being set after another during yet another Tasmanian storm. I wanted to like it, but in the end it disappointed me so many times that I have to give it a thumbs way down."
2,"Good acting, terrible writing","Willem Defoe and the supporting cast do a fine job. The script, however, is nauseatingly bad. Defoe is supposedly playing ""a mercenary sent by a shadowy corporation"" to track down the last living specimen of the ""Tasmanian tiger"" in order to extract its rare biological properties. The mercenary, however, acts more like a timid city dweller with limited camping experience, let alone combat. He is afraid to use an outhouse, cringes at a dirty bathtub and fails to consider that he might not be the first or only person assigned his current mission. He also has his key data in an unencrypted laptop and leaves on his desk the coordinates of a secret location where he thinks the animal lives.Lovely cinematography, great soundtrack, good acting, horrible writing."
4,"Solid performance, good storyline, amazing scenery","Dafoe is a solid actor and shines in this solid bit of storytelling. I very much enjoyed this movie, with the breathtaking scenery, good acting and interesting storyline. Recommend for sure."
4,Surprisingly Riveting,"I finally decided to watch The Hunter and was very surprised by how good it was. The preview for this movie doesn't do it justice and the story is very well designed. Willem Dafoe captivates the audience with his inner conflicts and struggles to do the right thing. Should he give his evil boss what he wants or do the right thing? Well that part is a bit predictable, but the characters in the film are interesting enough, and the ride to the finish is unique and entertaining."
3,Dafoe Nailed It,Great character. Interesting plot. I liked this movie. I would have liked it better if the other characters int he movie had been developed more fully.
3,"Not bad, but not great either","The movie was not what I was expecting, but it was not boring. OK to watch. Would not recommend purchasing - it's rated a rental, unless your rich and if you are - feed the hungry.The end was disappointing, but such is life."
3,Interesting,"Nice movie, I keep with the sensation of this could be a best film for the actors and the idea"
4,Not What I Expected but Liked It Just the Same,"While ""The Hunter"" will prove too slow-moving and anti-climactic for many tastes (a tense action drama 'tis not), it is a thoughtful, mood-provoking film that includes a stunning visit to a part of the world (Tasmania) that is quite unfamiliar to most non-Australians. The whole mood is somber and virtually humorless, with subtle layers of conflict, intelligent pacing that imitates real life but will leave many viewers raring for more to happen, and some quiet, unexpected turnabouts towards the end. Good acting by just about all, most particularly Morgana Davies and Finn Woodlock as the kids, who prove to be the most unique and memorable characters here. The ""Deleted Scenes""--some of which maybe should have been left in--are worth a look."
4,Very good unkown movie,"Like other reviews this movie was very good and should have had a wider release. This wasn't a big budget movie, but the story was thoughtful and well played by the lead Dafoe."
2,The True Story,"The movie started slow and I thought it would pick up for some real action,but never did .The true animal that really needed to be hunted was his self ."
2,Not Good - The Hunter,"I expected much more out of this movie. I was looking for adventurous, wild life, and scenic movie and this one does not give you any of those. Acting was 2/10, Drama was non existent 0/10, Flow 2/10, The Ending was awful 1/10. I know, my critics are harsh, but this movie gets 15 out of 100. Do NOT watch this. Hope this helps many of you!"
1,Boring,"Just kept waiting for something to happen, not much to the story, not much to a plot leading up to the ""I'm gonna go see some sights"" or something along those lines."
2,What is this?,"I hate to give a bad review but this movie really begs for one.No plot whatsoever,I kept waiting for a story line to pop up and all I could do was scratch my head.I enjoy watching Dafoe but I wish he had passed up this role!"
1,Disappointing Ending,"What a slow moving movie, very boring until the very end.SPOILER: I have a BIG problem with how this ended, being that he kills the endangered animal in the end, only to THEN decide to not give in to Red-Leaf and burn the remains instead of turning them into that company. Why not have just left it alone, he definitely wasn't helping the animal by offing it. Stupid, Stupid, Stupid hunter. Movie would have at least made MORE sense if after killing the animal he turned the specimens over after all that happened. But then again, I hate hunting and people that kill animals as sport or leisure."
3,Ponderous,"While this movie kept my attention it was a bit short on action and long on the morality of hunting an endangered species to extinction. Secondly, it was difficult to find a real plot beyond the tired ""tormented"" man finds life alone satisfying. I won't offer a spoiler here but I suspect the viewer will find the last 20 minutes or so rather disturbing if not disappointing. This could have been much better."
4,Beautiful and quietly thrilling film,I really liked this movie. Dafoe is excellent. The rest of the cast is very good. The scenery is gorgeous. THis film is very watchable. It's a good film with the quiet power of something like The American with George Clooney. Maybe better than that.
4,Really good story,I just finished viewing this film and found it to be a very good movie. Really enjoyed the story and Dafoe's performance.
4,Julie,It was an excellent movie with Willem Defoe. The plot was good. The movie did drag in places and then captivated you again.
4,Good movie,"I like the plot and setting, I have mixed emotions about the outcome and would have liked to have seen a different ending."
2,Had potential. Really disappointing,"W. Dafoe is surrounded by a bunch of no good antisocial idiots up in the mountains. Not sure why everybody hates him. He is coming to hunt something. Not sure what and why.He arrives in a house with kids where the mom is depressed because her husband has disappeared. He quickly connects with the kids. Not sure what is he doing there and what is the point. Sam Neil's role is still not clear to me. Towards the middle of the movie we know what is he doing up there. Doesn't make any sense scientifically. Not sure how the genetic material will help and for what disease. The whole thing is weird and disconnected.The ending is surprising, not predictable but totally stupid. I still didn't get the message...if there is any!Very poorly done. Expected better from the cast. Two stars just for the acting."
4,a touching story,"A very good film. Sad commentary on humanity, but also redeeming in some ways. Gorgeous scenery. I recommend watching it."
4,good movie,"I enjoyed this movie the story was quite different from mainstream, and the senery is way cool on big screen"
2,The Hunter,I just saw the Hunter starring Willem Dafoe.I think the concept was interesting and the acting was good by all. The pace of the movie is a bit slow and very meticulous.My only problem was that I feel the ending left me kind of cold and it just did not ring true to his character's portrayal and what he did based on what you learn about him.
4,What does it mean to kill the last Tasmanian tiger?,"This is a film for people who spend their life at Starbucks doing Facebook on their iPad. It touches on certain cliche popular myths and pretends to have some great idea behind it. I'm sure I could invent a metaphor for what it's all about but I'm not sure that's part of the film. But it is very well made, I'll say that. Superb photography and editing. Good acting and casting. And interesting to look at because of the scenery and vegetation. Killing the last Tasmanian tiger....I'll have to figure what that means. Several times I asked myself ""why not the yeti instead of the Tasmanian tiger?"" Now that would be an interesting film. A better film than many, but not one I'll chose to watch over and over."
2,So Slow it Put Me to Sleep!,"William Dafoe is a great actor and is the only reason why this movie got 2 stars and not 1 star. The plot was flawed, unrealistic and the overall story did not make any sense.I am upset that I wasted almost 2 hours of my time and $9.99 to see this horrible movie before it was in theaters. I hope the movie studios learn from the poor rental results and do not waste their money promoting this film."
2,"This is a CHICK FLICK, not a man movie","Came up as a recommended movie for me. I like military movies, especially movies about snipers. This turns out to be a chick flick dressed up as a man movie. So SLOW. No action. Protagonist who is supposed to be some kick-ass specialized hunter turns into a mangina pussy and cries about scoring his kill. I am pissed about losing two hours of my life I will never get back."
4,Hunt this one out,Watching this on my Amazon Prime movies was really quite a treat. Much better than a lot of mainstream movies. Actor Willem Dafoe gives an outstanding performance here in this much different type of movie.
2,Depressing,"If you were anti hunting before this movie, well this movie won't change your mind. Very depressing. Not recommended at this time. I have seen better movies with Willem Dafoe."
3,Nothing Great!,The movie is very slow moving. I kept waiting for the action to start but it kept dragging and dragging.
2,Mediocre at best,"Interesting to read previous reviews. I can't say I agree with any of them. I like Defoe as an actor, but an actor needs something to work with. If you have a couple of hours to waste, or need something to put you to sleep, this will probably work."
2,Movie Completely Lost Me,"As much as I like Willem Dafoe as an actor, this movie totally lost me half-way through and I gave up on it. I guess I'm not the only one since the movie totally bombed in the U.S. last year. Dafoe is hired by a biotech company to hunt down the last known Tasmanian tiger in Australia to obtain it's DNA. In the process, he gets involved with 2 children who's father has diappeared and whose mother is an alcohol and drug abuser. Because his mission is secret and the locals are suspicious, he must pose as a university researcher. At this point I gave up on the movie."
2,Mildly entertaining but forgettable.,An interesting movie with a few good parts. But for the most part it's rather forgettable. I'd check out something else in the genre before this one.
3,"Looks like four stars, barely makes it to three","I picked this movie among many due to location (Tasmania), the main actor, and the somewhat exciting futuristicidea of a poacher into extinct species. The movie is professionally filmed and looks good, is fully watchable,but at the end of the day does not rise to the first promise. Sometimes not making clear who are the good guys and the bad guys adds some depth to a story, but here it comes across as some muddling of bigger issues (environmentalism, localsustainability, lonely hero character, big corporations and rough locals)."
3,sad and depressing,"while interesting, this was one of the saddest and most depressing movies i've watched in a long time. sad for the humans. sad for the animals. just sad."
3,"Nice movie, but too slow and lack of actions.","I started watch this with an impression that this is an action thriller, but this is everything but. Overall the content is real and good, but it's really slow. We see tons of things to reflect upon, but if you want actions and suspensions then this will disappoint you, big!"
3,Loving Willem Dafoe,"And I do...I'm a junkie for almost anything he appears in. This film is a little too fantastic, too sensitive, for me. Rare species, unicorns in the jungle...that's an analogy, folks...the dilemna of the hunter, the angst of man versus nature...it was watchable, although slow."
2,Without Suspense,"This movie fell short of having an interesting and suspenseful storyline. Lacked in directing, plot, and climactic moments. Could've been much better."
2,not very good,"This kind of movie the tv channel use to complete your schedule, boring,no action like in the trailer.Not interesting, need more action and less talk, 40 min is good, 1h is bad, 1:40h i can't saw this, sorry."
4,Littletext.com switch,"Ordered this book from Littletext.com as a new hard cover and recieved a softcover international addition. I wouldn't mind using international version since there is hardly any difference, but don't bait and switch on me I don't like it. I'd buy from someone else if the price was within a couple bucks. Got my book not from Chicago as advertised, but Thailand. However it was delivered in no time."
3,International Business 5th edition,"The book came before they said it would and that is good, but when I went to read Chapter 4 on Culture the entire chapter had been ripped out of the book except for the summary. I had to do an online search for all the questions that my instructor had about the chapter. Other than htat so far so good"
3,Expected new - but wasn't,I paid the extra couple bucks to order a new book - however as i began reading noted that there are numerous pages with multi-colored highlights . . .
3,Get it together KV!,I still can't figure out why KV sells the standards in brown paint and they call the clips that match the standards walnut which are anodized aluminum. I am pleased with the products but I expected to get the standards anidized and they came painted. Get it together KV!
2,Doesn't work that well,"I got this for my '96 Geo Tracker and it works well but honestly you are better off getting a standard boot. (I couldn't get to it then) The glue it comes with will eventually start to lose it's hold and it doesn't come with much grease, also the clams are a pain and the top insert to hold it's seal will work it's way out of the boot so you with have to find a way to keep it in so dirt doesn't get in the boot."
5,No Fake Here! KJL Spills All,"This gorgeously photographed book is a collector's item in itself. Told from Mr. Lane's point of view, we are privy to his creative process, inside circles and spheres of influence. The Jewelry covered is from 1960s to the mid-1980s. A must for collectors and hopefuls. Within 2 weeks I was able to pick up a very early Kenneth Lane piece by recognizing it from this book, and at a fantastic price! I have seen this book offered for a variety of prices and was thrilled to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price for a good, signed copy."
2,Great pictures - no help on value of pieces,"This book has beautiful pictures, but not enough info & absolutely no help on figuring out values."
1,Can't think of anything I learned here.,"This book is twelve chapters of ""Business for Dummies"". Quite honestly, if you don't know the majority of this book you shouldn't be in manufacturing.Not a single complex thought is brought forth in this book. Save your money and your time."
4,Lovejoy is back and better than ever!,"After the last two books by Jonathan Gash digging into the seamier side of London, and the sex trade, with his new heroine, he has graced us with new Lovejoy mystery. Some of his entourage is missing, no Tinker, and no new trainee, but he does succeed in making smiles, stealing antiques, breaking and entering, and impersonating a rock star. You never know what to expect from Lovejoy and he does not disappoint. Just when you think you figured it all out, a surprise ending. One of his best books in years, you will enjoy it."
2,"borrow, don't buy","I'd have to agree, this book wasn't as good as his previous Lovejoy ones. I'd say this one and the previous one 'Possessions of a Lady' are more of a ""borrow"" than a ""buy"". I hope #21 does pick up. I still reread his previous ones (esp. 'The Tartan Sell' my all time favorite)."
2,Is Gash running out of ideas?,"Easily the worst in the Lovejoy series. I've read them all, and half of them twice. Although there are some charming sections, and a brand new setting to explore, Gash's Lovejoy largely rehashes his philosophy without adding anything new. I'd felt that I had read it all before, and better said in earlier versions. In fact, I was shocked to learn that he was continuing the series after such a lackluster performance--though I was greatly pleased because I love the character and the stories. So, I'll buy the new one and chalk this up to being one mistake in twenty"
4,Breezy Mystery of a Death in a Dental Chair,"Marion Babson writes bright and breezy mysteries with a cozy feel. In this case the PR firm of Perkins and Tate faces the true test of public relations-- putting a favorable spin on the death of a public figure in their dentist's chair. Surrounded by a plethora of eccentrics including Malcolm-- the dentist's father, who still thinks a world war is going on-- I or II, he isn't picky; the dentist's wife who was not so much stolen by the dentist's partner as barrowed; and the dentist himself who is quite single minded when it comes to things dental.This is is a fun and not particularly serious novel that will happily pass an hour or two."
2,Interesting Characters,"I found the characters in this book to be intriguing, although they are each flawed and carry around a lot of baggage. They both were very pessimistic, which made them harder to like. The plot was a little predictable and sometimes hard to believe. I doubt a real law enforcement officer would let the man he'd just arrested for pulling a gun on him ride with him to catch a murderer, but the book was still an interesting read. The worst part was the very explicit scene of premartial sex between the main characters. There were also some editing errors, but not so many it made it hard to read."
3,quick read with some unanswered questions,this book was alright. why was nathan called a dreamer? i never really figured that out. why were the cows at the other farms sick and nathans werent. what is about putting the cows in shelter that made them sick. if anyone has these answers i would like to know.
4,Compelling,"Ms. Weir is noted for her controversial subjects. This one may just well be one of her best. If you've not read award - winning author Theresa Weir, you're in for a treat. This contemporary love story is a smooth, powerful, character-driven book with no gimmacks. It's beautifully written and engaging as it deals with the delicate subject of rape and healing. Well worth the money. I highly recommend it."
1,It did work,Don't buy it. It did not work. I placed all of them in the basement. They all gone next day and rats are still there.
3,If you garden in the city,"I read the book nearly cover to cover and was disappointed at how little direct help I found for vegetable gardening in my small Seattle back yard. Since the majority of folks living ""West of the Cascades"" don't garden on the acreage the author enjoys, I felt a little duped by the title. I know I'd appreciate a chapter in the book dedicated to those of us who garden in 200 square feet or less."
5,Most likely the only vegetable gardening book you'll need.,"Most of the previous reviews contained all the information about this book you'll need to make your decision to purchase or not to purchase.Without a doubt I concider this my best gardening book. And just wanted to get my five stars posted and bow to the author for a great work! Thanks, Steve."
3,Functional but not perfect,Good product...the only issue I have is the sponges are rather weak and break about easily. Also there is no stand or container for the handle.
5,So much easier to clean the toilet!,"This nifty product makes it so much easier to get the toilet clean, and it's so much less gross than a traditional toilet brush. These pads scrub the toilet really well, and they get under the rim. When you're done they come right off the wand. My only criticism is that putting the wand together is a bit counterintuitive, and the picture instructions were not all that helpful. That said, it got it together and it works great. I won't go back to a regular toilet brush."
4,Great Find,"This was my first Daisy Dalrymple Mystery. I picked it up at the library...would you believe...because I liked the cover! It was an enjoyable read, free from all the nasty, gory details that so many mystery novels offer today. Daisy books are dripping in history, lightheartedness, and intrigue. What an amazing combination! I have bought three of my own in this series and will definitely get more! By the way, I have discovered that the cover art is great on ALL the Daisy novels."
4,very sexy,"very sexy, comfortable even 4"" heels,I love all its colors: bronze, silver and gold. You wear with anything."
1,Total Rip Off,How I wish I'd read the reviews first. Only a complete idiot would learn anythng from this book. The TV infomercial come-on about the single thing that does X and Y is garbage. Don't eat a lot of fat. Eat Fiber. Exercise. Brush your teeth for over 30 seconds. Start slow when working out with weights No --- Sherlock! Do DOT waste your money on any repackaged junk from Bottom line. At least I bought this worthless paperweight used. Too bad I can't return it and wasted even the shipping fee.
2,It isn't the world's greatest,"There is some interesting information here but calling it the ""World's Greatest Treasury"" is definitely hyping it. Look for it in the library."
3,interesting,"this book is a collection of everything you ever needed to know about healthy living. some are medicaly correct and some are as I call them old wives tales, weather they help or not, they are all interesting. I think it was meant to be more of a reference book , and is very easy to read and look up whatever topics interest you!"
5,I like ....I like....!,"The Stars Speak by B. R. Hicks (Jan 1, 1975)Awesome! I would certainly recommend this book to people who are interested in how their birth signs match up with the bible. For people who read the bible and know of the Old Testament characters, would be interested to know that the word of God talks about the nature of these characters birth signs. The twelve zodiac signs that intrigue everyone of course can be followed more closely in the word of God. Each sign was represented by the twelve tribes of Israel. How cool is this. My sign which is Aries is said to be very well at balancing rest and work. This I found to be true about the way I live my life."
5,Stars Speak:,"Stars Speak:This book is easy to read and easy to understand for any on. This book discusses the different signs that are found in the zodiac, and the different characteristics that people born under certain signs display. We have all had questions about the different signs, this book will answer your questions, and the author only uses Bible verses and Scriptural interpretation, so it's very appropriate for all Christians."
4,Cool Movie!,"I have had friends tell me they didn't like this movie because it seemed a little too fake, but I understood going into it that it was intended to seem that way...sort of in the 70s shock picture style, kinda like Rodriguez & Tarrentino's grindhouse picture movies Deathproof and Planet Terror. It isn't exactly one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen, but I still thought it was pretty awesome...totally a guy movie. If you can handle a bit of gore and some language & some full fledged nudity don't bother you, I definitely recommend giving this movie a watch...just watch it without the kids, because definitely not appropriate for their eyes and ears! Beyond that though, this movie is pretty cool! I also recommendRobert Rodriguez Mexico Trilogy (El Mariachi / Desperado / Once Upon A Time In Mexico),Sin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray],Grindhouse (Two-Disc Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray], andFrom Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series)"
3,Leave your brains behind,"Machete is one of the movies that remind me so much of the Indian movies that I grew up watching when I was a child. A lone crusader, who can destroy a small army of thugs, gets to romance all the ladies, ultimately prevails. Danny Trejo is Machete, whose family has been killed by Steven Seagal. He is such a natural fit for this role with his deadpan expression, rugged frame; he gets to deliver the funniest lines in the movie thanks to a wickedly written script. This movie is set against the backdrop of border politics and has a slew of characters with Robert De Niro playing his silliest role in years. If you want entertainment and hefty doses of action, nudity, violence and ridiculousness then this is the film to watch. Pretty enjoyable for what it is....Four stars. 2/20/11"
4,High action packed flick.,"This is a real chop em' up movie not for the faint of stomach. Action packed and never letting up it keeps your attention, but a little far fetched at times. I like Danny Trejo but Jessica Alba and Michelle Rodreguez are really hot together."
1,Oh! Come on people!,"First, let me say this.... I am a fan of Robert Rodriguez... I like his other movies. I am also a long time fan of Danny Trejo. I love Steven Seagal, Robert Deniro, Michelle Rodgriguez, et al (except for Lindsey Lohan... and maybe Jessica Alba). I like shoot 'em up, vigilante movies a lot, but come on people! This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!! OMG!!! Within the 1st 5-10 minutes I knew it was a bad film. I watched all of it in the hopes it would get better, but it never did. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$$$$! It has definitely come off my wish list! You couldn't pay me to take the movie! If you haven't gotten my point.... it's a bad movie!!! I'm sure the wonderful actors in the movie did the best they could w/ the script. I think it COULD have been a good movie....but it wasn't! I can't believe Robert Rodriguez even had anything to do with this one! AAAAAGGGHHHH!"
1,Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.,"This movie was just awful. Acting was terrible, plot was trash and to top it all off its preaching about immigration and open borders the whole time. I went to this expecting a fun, over the top, hack and slash and left with my wife vowing to never let me choose another movie. Avoid at all costs."
1,Too Political and Confusing Message,"I had been waiting for weeks to see this. But, there was some sort of political message about illegal immagration. I'm not entirely sure what it was. ""We didn't cross the border, the border crossed us""?????? I think one of the appeals of director Robert Rodriguez work is the gratuitous violence. While the violence was there for sure, the confusing political message didn't seem to belong."
1,Violent and Stupid,"Don't get me wrong, I'm laughing at the usual level of ""over the top"" violence. However, when this is pared with lousy acting from folks who are obviously only in it for the money, AND a silly portrayal of some complex social issues, then this movie qualifies as inane and not worth more than the $1 rental I paid for it."
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely loved this movie, it was very entertaining, funny and full of action. I cant wait to have it in my collection! If you haven't seen this movie you definitely missed a very fun time. It was fantastic to finally see Danny Trejo leading a movie...oh and not dying (lol). This is a very worth buying DVD. The other reviews already explained the plot, but when you actually watch it you will realized it is much better..."
2,Machete,"If you like blood, this is the movie for you. The fight / blood scenes were way over the top and not that realistic looking but it was action packed. Not sure why he gets as many women as he does but this is hollywood. Not sure Steven Seagal makes for a good ""bad"" guy. Could have been better."
5,Viva Danny Trejo!,"I can't think of a harder working or more deserving character actor/producer that deserves his time in the lead spotlight - think of the cool, amazing and memorable roles that Trejo has had from Heat to Con Air to From Dusk Til Dawn. Gotta love his humble sense of humour on the movie set too:De Niro - ""Hey Danny, haven't seen you since we did Heat, glad to see that you finally got your first starring role"".Trejo - ""Mr. De Niro, go and get me a cup a coffee""..... F***ING PRICELESS!Hats off to Rodriguez for staying loyal to one of the good guys/Trejo and not letting Hollywood or the critics mess with the magic. Hope to see RR filming in Detroit one day...while Michigan still has its 40% film rebate. I can't wait to see Machete this Friday! Viva Danny Trejo!!!!Scotty G in Detroit!"
1,TOTAL GARBAGE,"This a TOTAL GARBAGE! I have watched my LAST Steven Seagal movie, and so he's reaped his last dollar from me. This ""movie"" is nothing more than Hollywood continuing to feebly attempt to ""shape"" public opinion in FAVOR of the illegal ""bean eaters"" (a term used often in the movie, not a term I typically use) that continue to infest this country. If I could rate this garbage a NEGATIVE 5 stars, I most certainly would."
1,Pure Trash,"Machete is, without exception, the single worst movie that I have ever had the misfortune of loading into my DVD player. The only good thing about it is that a friend of mine gave it to me. After realizing that he was just trying to get rid of his garbage, I gave it back. I suppose that I could have regifted it as a mean spirited joke. Save your money for something worth watching."
1,HORRID,"Easily the worst movie I've ever seen. Subversive, anti-American, not even B quality. DeNiro has lost his mind associating himself with a piece of crap like this. Go ahead, watch it.... You'll agree I just wasted my time even reviewing it."
1,machete,"The worst movie I have ever seen. Absolutely the worst.Actors who are normally somewhat tolerable are horrid, including seagal trejo, deniro, and alba.Script was made apparently when writers were stoned,am sure it sounded very good at the time.A quarter at a yard sale for this would be overcharging; and would have to say 12 hail mary's for taking advantage."
1,A tasteless political appeal peddled as an action flick,"Incessant and naive commentary on the immigration problem made this movie entirely uwatchable. Slick and cliched, utterly ridiculous and idiotic. But above all -- in poor poor taste. This flick represents a deadend dementia, though perhaps an expected one, of the R. Rodriguez's Mexican theme. It is, basically, crap."
1,Kill Whitey,Basically the whole theme of the movie is how mexicans should kill off all the white people in the US in order to take over the US for themselves.
1,Michete,"I love the main actor Danny Treo, but this movie is just CAMPY. I was very disappointed. Why would anyone hire Lindsey Lohann she is an idiot and their are way sexier young hot female actresses, who could have done her role. I liked Cheech Maron as the priest, the best part of the movie. I am happy Cheech is still doing some roles. I also thought Michele Rodriguez was pretty cool as She. But I thought Jessica Alba's character stunk. She didn't fit at all in this movie. I would have had Michele Rodriguez play that part. Jessica is not tough and gritty enough for this kind of movie. Don't get mad at me Danny you are a great talent but this film needed more Machete and less Jessica. Also get rid of Jeff Fahee he is a washed out second stringer."
3,Its okay,I was looking for a good slasher grindhouse movie but this movie was very slow at times. Its worth the rental but dont expect too much from it
3,No One Said it would be a Masterpiece,"Rodriguez made this as a tribute to the cheap, trashy entertainment of vintage grindhouse films. So in that context, it's the perfect film. That also means that it's really not worthwhile. It's in exactly the same vein as _Planet Terror_ (though I did enjoy _Machete_ more).So if your expectations are for silly, campy, over-the-top fun (and _everything_ about it is campy, from the dialogue down to the casting of DeNiro, Segall, Lindsay Lohan & Cheech Marin in the same film), you'll have a nice, dirty time watching it."
5,Its a good movie,"Well, out of all the fake trailers from grindhouse double feature Machete was expected as it was Steven Segal & Robert DeNiro in a movie together was more that brought others to be aware about. I never got to see it in theaters, thanks"
5,Machete DVD Review,"Filled with awesome fights and hot chicks, this is a good flick. Action-packed film. It has an all-star cast for action films and does a real nice job of providing action entertainment."
5,INTERESTING!!,A lot of republicans did not like this movie!!!Angry about shearing land that one day was part of Mexico.
5,Machete cuts through the B.S.,"There will be no Oscars. There will be no awards. But that's Okay. This movie is simply a lot of fun to watch. Sure there are large plot holes. And the scritpt isn't tight. But so what. It's bloody, it's over the top and it's just perfect the way it is.Danny Trejo has been a favorite 2nd banana actor of mine for years. Great to see him in a lead role. Robert Deniro as a whacked out Senator? Of course, why not! Lindsay Lohan as a drug adled psycho - type casting. Same with Steven Segal - sure he's bloated and weighs 300 pounds, but as a sleazy Drug boss - he's perfect, he may finally have found a role that really suits him.I love this movie. It's not art, but it's great fun and I expect I'll watch it several times more in the next few years. Highly recommended."
4,Exploitation at it's finest,"Literally 5 minutes into this movie, I felt like I was 17 again watching cheesy Showtime B-movies at 2am.This movie is so over the top, its more like a roller coaster ride. Just pure funAnd Michelle Rodriguez is smokin hot in this - omg"
2,Machete,"Danny's performance in Desperado was more ""down to earth"" and entertaining than his role in Machete. Yes, action, violence, and gratuity sex are in this film; however, the director makes Danny take the action to beyond earth heights and far into fantasy. Attempts to suspend disbelief does nothing to regard Danny's knife scenes beyond comical or at best on a par with the wonderous flying martial arts actors who blithly skip on water in Chinese films. Danny is a solid character actor who deserves a better director. The film will make one question their blood lust motives."
5,Just the most fun film of 2010!!,It's over the top. It's entertaining. It's just great fun! The story is absurdly fun and the acting is just as fun and the visuals are just fabulous! Nothing else to say.
1,Pretty Awful,"I normally dig Rodriguez/Tarintino flicks, but this one was just awful. Too political, the plot was over the top. Basicly just a two hour violence and sex fest with lousy storyline. Ashamed that DeNiro would even be in a piece of crap like this. Jessica Alba and Lindsay Lohan are two of the worst actresses in the history of cinema."
1,Worse movie ever,I knew it would be bad & cheesy but gave it a shot because I like Danny Trejo Robert & De Niro but holy cow terrible. Michelle Rodriguez & Jessica Alba acting is just bad is the nicest I can be. It's just bad. I saw 10 minutes & couldnt stand anymore nor stop laughing.
2,Fun to watch but totally meaningless rubbish,"The movie has a terrible story line and setting, which does not any creativity like of Mr. Robert Rodriguez's films, which are almost all of them are just crab. Throughout the film, Machete just goes crazy with revenge, and kill everyone gets in his way. The movie seems politically motivated but in a really crappy way, which some meaning to the story. But all Robert Rodriguez' movies are just violent without any meaning."
1,watch something else,"The movie looked fun, but ended up being so predictable and corny, yet desperately trying to be political at the same time. It was mostly a ""B"" movie with a high paid cast. It even included cheesy bass guitar during the seductive scenes, as if trying to cater to the soft-core porn crowd. Awful. The ""bad"" white guys all have to have Texan accents and have to act stupid and uncaring in order for the movie to somehow work. Waste of money. Waste of time. Danny Trejo has played the same, exact character in every movie I have seen him in. Only in this movie, he actually has a couple lines. **note** a couple. I don't understand how others have given this movie a good review...."
1,Too gruesome!,"This movie is too gruesome and is of ""B"" movie quality! I know this has a huge political agenda which is not why I watch movies, either. It has a great cast, so that's why I wanted to watch it, but I couldn't get through more than 45 minutes of this movie as it was too dark, too gruesome, too political and just too low class! I think there are much better ways of making your political point than making a gruesome movie!"
1,TERRIBLE movie!!,"I would not reccommend this to anyone!! It looked like a very cheaply made moive, like an amatures attempt at directing, but with BIG name Hollywood stars. I can not believe that stars would want to put their name on such a poor story line and direction!"
3,Multi culturism is good.,"good movie, something, Sanchez, mexican, united states, border crossing, politically correct. new world order, serfdom, fun , entertaining. Hollywood acters"
5,Yeah baby!,"This movie is rather gory in some parts, but is a good movie if you're into slasher action. If you're a fan of Danny Trejo, this is definitely the film for you, as he is the star 'Machete' and kicks plenty of @$$ in this movie! You also get Jessica Alba and Steven Seagal playing supporting roles in this movie. Some of the scenes might be campy or overblown to some, but to me, it just adds some charm. Well, as much charm as a violent movie can have, at least. Plenty of explosions, shoot-outs, and confrontations make this a movie that you shouldn't be bored of. :P"
2,Thank God for Netflix!,"I am so glad I didn't spend my hard earned cash on this garbage. I know what to expect from Rodriguez but he failed miserably. Immigration propaganda aside, it was just boring, unfunny and way too long. Boo"
3,Machete,"There is action, nudes, and many funny parts. Hard to tell if this is a serious movie, or a comic one. Starts off as Machete as a Mexican Police officer with his long Un-cut hair, and a Uniform too tight for him A slap in the face for the Mexican Police. The plot was hard to keep up with. It was interesting with what happens next? There are two more Machete movies coming. I think I will pass on them. Not a family type movie for sure. It is a different type of movie. Lot of blood with his machete. I liked Machete as a Actor, but the story was weak. If you like blood, and guts this is your movie. Lots of laughs.....and dead bodies."
4,"Great Movie, So-So DVD","This is a nifty B movie with an amazing cast, but the shortage of extras on the DVD might merit waiting until a better edition is released at some point in the future.NO director's commentary... NO making of featurette. Just an actual audience response soundtrack option and a few deleted scenes running less than ten minutes.Machete may not text, but he sure deserves better than this bargain-bin release. Of course, the DVD is from Fox, so why would anyone expect anything better from a Rupert Murdoch company?I hope Robert Rodriguez of all people finds a better distributor for his films in the future..."
2,Just plain bad,"Sadly, this probably could have been a decent movie. As it is, I thought it was just plain old bad."
4,"""Machete"" Rocks And Rolls...","Danny Trejo as a leading man? it works in this one, Trejo is ""Machete"". Desperado director Robert Rodriquez revives this film from a sample trailer on his ""Planet Terror"" dvd shown in the extras. The bottom line...this was intended and meant to be a cult film, blood, gore, nudity...lots of t & a, and loaded with non-stop action...how many cult films do you know of really received high ratings in cinema history...low percentage, the concept of Machete makes this film a winner, Rodriquez was never looking for an Academy award. There's also no denying a political statement throughout, this is the plot with an all-star cast, Robert De Niro, Steven Seagal, Jessica Alba, Cheech Marin, and Don Johnson...Machete is a matter of taste, it's not for everyone. The dvd format is 16x9 widescreen, the extras include deleted scenes."
5,DIFFERENT BUT GOOD,IT WAS ALSO ACTION PACKED THE ENDING DID SURPRISE ME BUT I ENJOYED IT ANYWAY AS USUAL STEVEN SEAGAL FILIMS ARE STILL MY FAVORITE
1,I smell a double dip!,"Almost NO special features from a director who packs his discs with them?! Greedy companies (Like 20th Cent FOX) want to bleed us dry and have super-fans purchase 2 copies: (1) bare bones disc now and (1) ""special directors cut"" later. My advice: HOLD OFF, rent it now, and buy the (almost certain) re-release in a few months! It's happened COUNTLESS times with major releases and, quite frankly, is insulting. Show them we are wise to their games and won't be taken advantage of anymore!"
2,All was well,"Until the last 30 or so minutes of the movie, then it just fell apart. I really wanted to like this movie but I can't commit."
2,Numb and Dumb with just a little Fun,"Not nearly as good as it could have been, Machete is pretty good for a rental and lousy as a purchase (no extras).Director Robert Rodriguez is normally much more clever with his set pieces and camera work. This movie feels like exactly what it is - a quickly-made movie based on a clever parody trailer. DeNiro and Don Johnson (and others) are wasted, obviously hoping for some of the cool cred that Bruce Willis got from his turn in ""Sin City"" (but that movie had great source material and style to spare). Rodriguez is slumming here, stretching one or two nifty moments over 90 minutes.It's (severed) heads above most wannabe B action movies you could rent, but it's certainly sub-par for Mr. Rodriguez. Watch ""Planet Terror"" instead.PS: The preachy and ludicrously biased depiction of America's border concerns is a big plot distraction."
3,Was that Lindsey Lohan (yes!)?,"Based on the 70s exploitation flicks that had a stupid plot and enough sex and violence if you weren't laughing at the stupid plot.There's a lot of known actors and actresses in this picture so they're all in on the joke. That said, you have to like these types of films and I have mixed feelings about it. Didn't really grow up with this stuff so it's a bit weird at times, though, I did laugh at the intestinal scene. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: C plus to B minus; VIOLENCE/SEX: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: Mid March 2011."
1,poor,This is a chessy movie with some big names. Jessica and Michelle are hot as hell as usual but thats about it. very disappointed. 1 3/4 hours I will never get back. Watch at your own risk
1,Over reviewed,I read the good review and watched it. I didn't bother watching the whole movie. The action scenes were subpar..done like a cheap scifi movie.
1,Simply Awful,This is possibly one of the worst movies made. It's easily one of the worst that I've seen. It's simply awful.
4,Very enjoyable,"I almost did not read this book because of the spotlight reviews. After having read it, I believe the spotlight reviews need to be changed in order to not deter any more people from reading this book. I did not think the wait for Maxim was so horrible. In fact, I really felt the pages with Nicholas flew by. Once Maxim entered the story, things really began to cook though. Absolutely loved the pranks the two pulled on each other. I was almost sad to see them finally fall in love because I enjoyed their hilarious fighting so much. In this book, in particular, I felt that Woodiwiss did a fabulous job aquainting us with the characters. I felt as though I knew them. Please give the book a chance. If reading for fast romance is all you want, then perhaps this book is not for you. But if you enjoy a good story, complete with details on many different topics, I think you will enjoy."
2,Way Too Verbose,"Woodiwiss has good basic plotlines, likeable characters, and a good moodsetting, but she is way too verbose. It really gets tedious after the first 400 pages of this 650+ page book. It seems like she is trying too hard to demonstrate her excellently fabulous, superfluously educated, bemusingly extensive vocabulary. Who wants to work that hard in their leisuretime? If the reader wants to find out what happens next, she has to sift through eight or more assininely superfluous, extremely bemusing, long descriptive paragraphs to get the the next word in each dialogue. Please. I found myself skipping entire paragraphs, and just reading the dialogue. Had a hard time finishing this one."
4,Worthy of reading!,"I agree with some of the other reviewers- I sure was glad to see Maxim finally show up in the story line and I would rather he had shown up sooner. The story is a good one. Elise has some spunk and I really liked her. She was not one to ""take things lying down."" I admired the friendship Maxim had with the other men. Even Nicholas and Maxim had a special respect for each other - and I did like the part Nicholas played. I do recommend this book. It is a book the reader will find entertaining with humor, suspense, and romance. It may take a little getting into it before the reader gets swept away into the story but- once it happens the pace is fast and sweet. I rate it as being ""worthy of reading!"""
3,well well,ms woodiwiss has written many books that are both electrifying and capture the reader this however for me is not one i loved the dialogue of the main lead especially when he expressed how he felt as a male but that was few and far between the girl came across as extremely immature and though ms woodiwiss wanted to portray as feisty she was more irritating than ever switching her emotions with a flip of a hat another issue i had was that this book was more centered on the plot than the romance which kind of got boring after a while as i wanted to read a historical romance my final peeve was it was loaded down with German or English with a German mix now if that doesnt kill romance and in a crucial scene where the guy gives a stern command to men threatening his woman its all in German a real mood killer as i still dont know what he said to them!?i gave it three stars and not two simply for the guy Maxim he was well written pity the rest around him let the book down!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Woodiwiss is akimbo!!,"What an insult to one's intelligence to read such drivel! The author must have learned a new word ""akimbo"" just prior to writing this book, and tried to use it in every way she could, and as frequently as she could! Her overuse of this word was so annoying and distracting that it ruined what might have been an OK story!"
3,So not worthy,"Hard to get into. Too much junk writing. I like Woodiwiss, but not this one. Sorry I bought it. Still not through reading it cause I can only stand so much at a time."
5,"Laughed so hard, I thought I would be sick","Having read most books written by Kathleen Woodiwiss and finding them very enjoyable, I had a bit of difficulty getting through the first few chapters of ""So Worthy My Love."" However, once Maxim came on the scene in full force, I laughed myself silly and could not put the book down. The physical and verbal exchanges between Elise and Maxim were thoroughly entertaining. Maxim doesn't quite fit the mold of the other heroes (if one could call them that)of Kathleen's other novels. I found him to be overall a more decent fellow from the start. It's definitely my favorite of her novels. Will definitely be reading it again and again throughout the years."
5,a favorite,I loved this book! Elise is fiesty and Maxim is the man of anyones dreams. There are some truly funny scenes and lots of adventure. I highly recommend this book!
2,I couldn't even finish this book.,"I've been a Woodiwiss fan for years. Shanna, The Flame and the Flower, and The Wolf and the Dove were classic Woodiwiss. I was such a fan that I even pre-ordered this book before it was released. I couldn't even get through it. Hopefully her newer books will be better."
3,Editing anyone?,I was irritated from the start...there were many characters introduced with little development and for a while it was difficult to remember who was who. I'm especially disappointed with the typos in the Kindle edition where whoever copied it continually replaced the letter l with a b in addition to many other errors.
2,INSOMNIACS- here's a cure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I never even finished the book.The pace was slow, the characters were shallow and the plot was obvious.Thank goodness this isn't the only Woodiwiss novel I've ever read or I would be sure not to read another.Of course, there are occasionally ones you don't like and this turned out to be one of mine."
3,So Worthy?,"I had to rewind the tape over and over, first because of the heavy British accent and then because the novel is hard to follow. I often found myself wandering in other thoughts. The novel seems predictable and the only goodies may be the romantic sceenes."
3,"""So Worthy"" not worthy of Woodiwiss","All the wonderful elements of a truly memorable romance that I've come to expect in Woodiwiss's books were missing in ""So Worthy My Love."" For an adventure - suspense story, it was burden down with words. The rhythm and mix was off. But worst of all the hero's character was less appealing than his subordinate's character, Nicholas. Infact neither hero nor heroine were as charming as most of Woodiwiss's characters, like those in ""The Flame and The Flower"" or ""The Wolf and The Dove."" In ""So Worthy"" the dialogue sounded like a mediocre Shakespearian wannabe penned it. While I know the story took place during Elizabeth's reign, when Shakepeare actually wrote, trying to mimic the language of the day did not serve this book well. Unfortunately, beneath all the disappointing features of this book lies a clever idea for a good book. I hope the author will revisit this concept with another attempt."
2,Not so worthy my attention ...,"I don't know why, but I didn't like this book. Maybe I wasn't content with Elise - I prefer calmer heroines, like Heather from The flame and the flower"". I also think Maxim was nothing exceptional and he rejoined the storyline in almost half of the book. Sometimes I found German grammar incorrect and I was confused with German names. Nicholas was Dutch or German? Because von Reijn is half a Dutch name and half a German. And why did Nicholas's mother use Sie"" (polite You"") instead of du""? I could recommend So worthy my love"" to those readers who admire wild and brazen heroines. Surely it'not for me."
3,Jury Duty,"I bought this book because I was going to jury duty and would need to pass quite a bit of time.The book is ""old"" and the author has passed away, so if you like her novels, there is a limited amount and there won't be any newer titles.The author was suggested to me from my boss who is in her mid 50s. I enjoyed this story once I got past the German accent of one of the characters.The story is a love triangle, starts in England, soon travels to Germany, then back to England.Time is Queen Elizabeth I. There is love, resentment, an abduction, deception, a battle, and a happy ending.Entertaining at the very least."
4,Neutron Jack,"Jack Welch has his eyes on the horizon since the 1980s. It has led a lot of changes, delayering management, reducing the number of business units, cultivating ideas and keeping GE nimble. So, that book is intersting for readers who do not know the Jack's management practices. (He is expected to retire in 2002)."
3,Fools Gold,"Applying some of the concepts of Mr. Welch's philosophy helped to facilitate operational improvement in my team that earned a distinguished company award. I was so enthralled that I purchased a GE fridge, and convinced my in-laws to do the same even though another brand of fridge lasted tham almost 30 years. Less than 5 years and thousands of dollars later, neither GE fridge is operational. The GE Way -- admire the brilliance, but stay away from the products."
2,TOP-NOTCH CEO........POORLY WRITTEN BOOK,"There is no doubt about it, Jack Welch is one of the best CEO's ever. I put a low rating on the book. I couldn't stand the style. Half the book is quotes from a Welch speech...which is fine. However, the other half is just paraphrasing everything Jack says to a ""T"". Very very very very very very very redundant. You can get great take-aways from Jack's style. Unfortunately you have to read through the entire book. It's 10 pages of great leadership skills packed into 300+ pages."
2,Author Paid By The Word,"Good overview of the Jack Welch way, including a variety of innovative business ideas that brought GE forward.However, as a book goes, it would appear the author was paid by the word. Each of the ""secrets"" is presented, reviewed, repeated, and presented again in a 300+ page book that would better be summarized in about 20. I kept reading after the first two chapters thinking I would learn somthing new, but honestly, save your money, read chapter one at the library, and go home with just as much insight.To the publisher, I'd recommed an ""executive summary"" version for the next edition."
2,Nothing new in this book. A broad brush portrait of Welch.,"Do not buy this book if you are looking for new insights into what makes Welch a great leader and GE a great company. I found its stories too shallow and overly complementary to Welch (almost as though they were written by GE's public relations folks.)Noel Tichy's book ""Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will"" while somewhat dated is a much better read.I cannot wait for a critical evaluation of GE's successes and failures, that includes lessons that other managers can apply in their companies. This book certainly does not get me there."
2,GE-speak: The language of the leader,"While this book provides readers with some worthwhile insights about the GE culture and its leader, its uncritical and somewhat superficial approach can be grating to a reader seeking solid insights. GE, of course, is a great company and Jack Welch is a true business leader, but somehow I sense an inconsistency between the purported values of this organization and the actual clone-like behaviour of its leadership (and supporters). This book won't provide you with too many 'ah-has' but it still has value if you want to peer into the GE style of communicating"
3,"Good, but fluffy and not exactly revolutionary - today","The book is a good read, but don't expect big surprises. Things like ""Be close to the customer"" may be true and fundamental, but it's not new to today's business - anymore. This book is more of an educational guide to management history. A great read, like I said, but don't expect too much 'hard info'."
2,A broad look at a true American leader.,"This book left a lot to be desired in terms of a good look inside General Electric and Jack Welsh. I was hoping for a truly unique look into what makes Mr. Welsh a great leader, instead we only get a gloss over of the basics."
3,Very good but be careful,"I bought this book based on a previous review. The book was everything the review stated. However, what I found out the hard way is the book is written for Microsoft Office 2000. Also, the exercises required either a data disk (not included) or downloading the files from the Internet. However, being an owner of Microsoft Office 97, I was out of luck.In summary, if you have Microsoft Office 2000 and a fast enough Internet connection to download the data files needed, the book is excellent. I, unfortunately, had to return it."
3,...but so verbose,"Reads like a very, very long, but well written, email. Next to impossible to use as any sort of reference; I find that I cannot even locate material that I've already read. Much better to follow a format like the Visual QuickStart guides, which give you BOTH (slimmed-down) step-by-step instructions AND are grouped into short lessons that are suitable for use as a reference (you don't necessarily need to read those books cover-to-cover, in sequence).Another problem w/the Zak book: I generally find that I'm not quite sure why I'm doing the steps that she's asked me to do. Surprisingly, the QuickStart guides provide some context.The Zak book is generally well-written and has relatively few errors, and it has a lot of screen shots, which can be helpful. One other plus: the book works around examples that you can download, making it suitable for use as a text."
3,Basic at Best,"Basic introduction to VBA, but probably not the best. Regardless, I first got an online version, definatly a bad idea. When you're learning a programming language it's just easier to follow a paperback."
5,Checkers,These checkers are at a great price and are what I was looking for. I would purchase from this buyer again.
2,read reviews b-4 you purchase,"I guess I should have read the reviews before I purchased this product. It is not like the checkers we has when I was younger, they do lock together, but they are smaller and cheaply made. Also, they do not come with the board which I also misunderstood and thought it was just a checkers game and not chess too. I am surprise the other two reviews gave such high marks."
4,Light in weight,These checkers are fine for what I wanted -- to fit an existing checkers board. I had hoped for something a little bit more solid-feeling but they are really quite acceptable.
1,false advertising,"I would send the product back but the postage would be more than they cost or close to it, . the product as advertised are to be 1 1/2 inches in dimanter, they don't even make 1 1/4.just over 1 1/8, very small and cheap, not what i expected. the reviews complained about how smallthey were, but the ad said they were 1 1/2 inches, I should have listen to the reviews but I want people to know they're not getting what the ad says it is"
1,Sending back,"I wish I read the reviews before I purchased. Who would have thought I needed to..its just checkers, right?! It was not clear to me that the board was not included with the game. I thought ""checkers only"" meant just the game of checkers, no chess or any other game included."
2,Too small for the price - look in dollar store for comparable product,"Even though this was the cheapest replacement checker set I could find online, I was surprised to see how small the checkers actually were for the price I paid. Perhaps 1/2"" in diameter too small and also too thin as compared to a standard set I used to have. What you actually get is something that you would expect to see in the 1 dollar stores. This product should not be priced more than a dollar. Disappointed."
4,Bittersweet,The coolest pair of boots I own but also the most painful. Additional ball o'foot padding is required if I'm going to be walking more than ten yards. Or meters.
5,THE PERFECT ANKLE BOOT,These boots are fantastic! The leather is great quality & they are actually quite comfortable for how high the heel is (note: pretty darn high). The fact that I got them on amazon for 30 buck is just icing on the cake!
3,Best Han Solo Figure,"This is the best Han Solo figure ever made!!, I had so much fun playing with him until i lost his gun,which is not fair,If you ever see this Han Solo figure i reccomend you getting Him."
3,not thrilled,Sent it back before I used it. Did not like the seal. Too easy to lose. Too maintenance needy. I like my previous pressure cooker. I am a low maintenance person.
1,Warranty is useless,"We bought this pressure cooker from Macy's. The body and handles are still in very good condition after about 1 year of moderate use. However, the red/purple-ish lock on the upper handle began to deform by the heat from the cooker (it is shielded from the stove burner by the lower handle), making the open and lock operation harder and harder, until finally the plastic piece is stuck to the open position rendering the pot thing useless. Fagor's warranty does not cover this. I was instructed to place an order for the upper handle assembly which costs over 1/3 of the price of the entire thing. I can't see how the problem is not caused by a defect in the material, or why one should continue spend money on the company's product."
1,Made in China?,"I returned this since it was defective and was a safety issue. I was also very disappointed when I took it out of the box to find out that it was not made in Spain, or the USA but China. Wish that Amazon would put that information on their website since when a customer is buying a product like Fagor one expects to be getting excellent European craftsmanship. Very disappointing for many reasons. Ended up buying a Kuhn Rikon pressure cooker after emailing the company to make sure their products sold on Amazon were guaranteed to be made in Switzerland. By the way KR has excellent customer service and answered both my emails in a few hours. Returned the Fagor, bought the Kuhn Rikon and very glad I did."
4,Nice,"The pressure maintains nicely without the old ""jiggler"". I wish it would have come with a rack and steamer unit."
2,Parts keep breaking,"We have bought this pressure cooker in Bed Bath and Beyond. In less than a year the lower part of the handle broke, and the replacement costs around $15.It is now about 3 years since we own this pressure cooker and the valve has broken and it will cost me another $16 to get a replacement part.I find it very annoying that such an expensive item keeps being costly over time. I guess it is great for Fagor to keep the money flow in, but they sell themselves as beeing ""Green"", and therefore they should not use parts purposedly made to break every year or two!!!!Other than that, all the nice things written by other reviewers are true."
5,NOT YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S PRESSURE COOKER,"Though I am a pretty basic cook (I can boil water; scrambled eggs are my specialty), the fear that many people have of pressure cookers should be laid to rest with this Fagor. Once you get the hang of it, cooking is as simple as putting all in the pot, closing it, making sure the dial is pointed to ""cook"" and the lid snap is closed, putting it on the heat and wait for the little yellow bobbie thing to pop up so you can turn down the heat and start your timer. If there's too much steam this mighty device releases it safely. Even I can do it! Some foods are easier than others, but if you want to create a quick, healthy chicken soup, this is your weapon!"
5,Pressure Cook without Fear!,"No time for slow food? This product saves hours in the kitchen and is easy to cool down and add ingredients midway through cooking. Although you may miss the familiar psst, psst of older style pressure cookers (and panicked runs to the kitchen), the quiet Fagor safety design ensures there will be no splatter and valve pop if you accidentally let it run dry."
4,fagor splendid,"I haven't owned a pressure cooker for more than 15 years. I decided to purchase a Fagor after reading many positive reviews. I was not disappointed! I like the ease and the safety features of this model, much better than the older 1970 pressure cooker. The Fagor heats very evenly and quickly. It appears very durable and well balanced. I would certainly buy another fagor."
4,"good so far, cant predict for how long","good cooker, have used all brands past 15 years, use every single day. All previous had safety valve failuress sooner or later.This one works well, cant say for how long. If it goes beyond a year, I'll give it 5 stars."
1,"Frightening and Unsafe , NEVER again","My S.O. loves a good value and purchased this Fagor pressure cooker on sale at Macy's at the end of the canning season. The money she saved on the pressure cooker has been offset by the costs of burnt food and yesterday's episode. While cooking a holiday meal with many guests in the kitchen, the unit suddenly lost its seal dumping super heated steam into the room and spraying boiling food on my guests. Fortunately no one was injured when the steam cleared. After sopping up the food and water from all over the kitchen and apologizing profusely, I unceremoniously threw this unit in the trash. I will never allow anyone I know to use Fagor's products in my company."
1,Pressure started leaking within a few days of use,"After about a week of use, the pressure cooker has started to leak steam even when the knob is adjusted to stop it from doing so. I am disappointed and don't recommend it to others."
1,replacement parts not available,"This pressure cooker worked well for a few months, then the tiny (3/8 inch) white rubber o-ring located inside the lid cracked and the cooker wouldn't seal. When I tried to find a repair part, the website shows it as part of the upper handle assembly, you must buy the entire thing for $15.00. When I click on the link to add it to my shopping bag, I'm informed that there are ""0 parts in stock, please try again"". Its been like that for 2 weeks. I will never buy anything from this brand again."
4,Good Value,"My wife uses a pressure cooker frequently and this one does a better job than our old Presto as it does not have any difficulty leaking around the seal. However, the thinner material of the Fagor led to us burning the first meal as the bottom heated up much quicker than the old Presto. Once we figured out the Fagor needs a lower heat everything has been fine."
1,Don't Buy It,"After using the pressure cooker only once, the lock malfunctioned in the middle of a large canning project. When we called customer service, we were told they would have to mail us a form then we could request a part by mail. Junk. Buy anything else."
2,Cool but not for the little guys,"Ours lasted exactly one week before the tail was broken off. poorly designed, cool looking but what fun is a broken toy?"
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"I have just read this tome and I am totally disgsuted. Not only is it no more than a poor extended record review but this author has made some HUGE mistakes. 1) pg38 ""..the presence of two of the Band of Gypsies, Buddy Miles and the bassist Billy Rich.. His name is Billy Cox!!! 2) pg51 ""..when he regarded the astronomical sucess his (white, with the exception of Herbie Hancock) proteges would win... When did Herbie turn white? The mundane droll that ensues could possibly be tolerated if the book was not riddled with such blantant mistakes. I would suggest anyone interested in this book purchase John McLaughlin cds instaed."
2,"Admirable, but unenjoyable","I chose 2 stars, out of guilt for having not read the earlier books in this series. I suppose those books would have made the large number of characters, races, countries and thier complex relationships easier to track, but I somehow don't think it would have mattered that much. The book seemed to be a very successful exercise in writting about WWII under the fantasy fiction genre, but it didn't grab me or entertain me at all. It didn't say anything new about WWII. If looking for a new take on the war, look elsewhere, there are hundreds of great works on WWII. There were so many countries and characters that it all got watered down, and I ended up not caring about any. Since it is a WWII fantasy-historical fiction novel it also has an understandably predictable ending. I will look for another Turteldove novel, but would not reccomend this one, especially if you have not read the other in the series."
3,Good but not thorough enough,"I was expecting it to be kinda like a ""this is how we live the Agrarian life and this is why...."" but it's only the why and NOT the how. The family members (adults mainly) talk about how they came to live the Agrarian life and how it's brought them close to God. It just felt kinda empty. it didn't even seem like they spent enough time on each family.It's only 44 min long and more time than needed spent on the narrator standing there talking. I was disappointed and am so glad that I didn't pay full price for it.I'd say if they added the ""how"" and about 10 more min on each family it would have been worth the money. Oh well. I did learn some points and am grateful for that."
5,Possibilities,"What if the rest of the universe never fell into sin? Main character is ""accidentally"" picked up by alien. Discovers a universe where people, not held down by pride, selfishness, etc. realize their full potential. Develop amazing travel technologies, colonize planets, love without reserve, live forever."
2,"Not the best Godzilla movie, but not the worst.","The special effects were decent up until The Moguera did battle with SpaceGodzilla in outerspace. Then they got lame. The planets floating all around during the battle looked like styrofoam balls. Little G was a little too cute for my liking. Also, you can't have a Godzilla movie without Akira Ifukube during the soundtrack. It's just not the same. I would have liked to have seen the Japanese version. It seems like Tri-star really doesn' t care about the dubbing or the picture quality. I have the Japanese version of Godzilla vs. Destroyah. It's amazing. I want to rent the new dubbed version just to make a comparison. Anyway, G vs. Space G is still entertaining if you're a diehard fan."
3,Space Godzilla,The Whole Space Godzilla thing was pretty lame.They could of come up with a better storyline then that.You got a a stupid robot wanna be mechagodzilla fighting and losing lol.And thatwhole outerspace fight look cheesy as hell I mean man that wasvery lame.The fighting was pretty cool not so great but it was alright.Pretty much Its an alright flick but not really great but its a must have for a G Fan
2,The worst of the new series of Godzilla movies,"i didn't like this movie. Spacegodzilla was poorly made. The crystals on his back looked like styrofoam and the space fight between MOGERA and Spacegodzilla was really cheap. This movie was a disappointment after what Mechagodzilla 2 produced. I think that Toho was trying to make a quick buck because the previous movie was a hit. It was fairly childish and very predictable. Even the fight between Godzilla and Spacegodzilla was boring. If you're a die-hard Godzilla fan, I think you would agree with my review."
4,Cool but Disappointing,"The movie was good. Like other reviewers, the dubbing was done very poorly. The movies was actually kind of boring. I thought there would be more action. All I saw was some special effects. Nothing else. Only if it had a better storyline with more action, this movie would have been great. But since it didn't, I would have to rate this lower than a 5. I even got bored at some point of the movie. I felt like going to sleep. But oh well. The only thing that save this movie from a total disater was the great special effect. But other than that, the movie was pretty horrible. Sorry people. I have to speak the truth. I too am a Godzilla fan and I have seen better. But oh well. Hopefully the new ones will be better."
5,One of the best godzilla films ever!,"Although not a mach for Godzilla vs. Destroyo this film is one of the best Godzilla films that I have ever seen. Godzilla is the only Sci-Fi movies that I like and it puts up very good to comady. I like comady better than anything and this movie is close enough to compare. That is why I have givin this movie 5 stars. Also like my aunt, if you like little baby Godzillas than this movie along with Godzilla vs. MegaGodzilla2 (not yet in english), and Godzilla vs. Destroyo. This movie is truely a great film! But if you get this film, also get Godzilla vs. Destroyo, Godzilla vs. King Ghidora, and Godzilla vs. MegaGodolla2.(after releised in english) If you would like to buy Godzilla vs. MegaGodzilla2 it comes out in english on August 3 1999."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I saw this movie on New Years Eve and I rated it a 4 at the time. But after I thought the movie over, I lowered it to a 2. I think that Godzilla looks awesome and the plot isn`t to hard to follow but I`m very upset that Godzilla didn`t use his new Spiral Fire breath that Rodan gave him until the end of the movie. I think that I may be questioned in the future about the reasons I thought the movie was stupid. Here are my top 3 reasons:1. The crystals on Spacegodzilla`s back look like ice cubes!2. MOGURA looks like a giant, metal, mechanical Woodpecker!3. Little Godzilla looks like a cross between the pillsbury doughboy and a green version of Barney! If they were trying to make him look cute, I think they did a much better job in the previous film."
4,Good but unrealistic effects.,"This film is really good but it was cheesy and could've been better by being realistic. Another thing and I'm talking about all the Godzilla films: Godzilla almost never plays a big role in any of the films, nor does the badguy! Only the lousy people, I mean, I don't mean to make fun of em or anything but it's supposed to be all about Godzilla and the badguy..."
4,Low ratings even from G-Fans??? What the?,"Ok so this movie isn't good in the special effects department, heck even sometimes in the movie I got upset with the lack of work done but I learned to look around the negatives and see it as an enjoyable film. There is a new, catchy theme, Spacegodzilla is a super cool villain unfortunately there is a really crap looking robot called Mogera and Baby Godzilla looks even worse than Minya which I thought was impossible. The fight is long but never got too boring I am not a fan of short battles so it's good to see more action than talk. The plot with the mafia was a nice quick touch to keep the movie interesting. All in all not the best but one too remember especially for g fans."
4,chesesy ...yet fun!,"This movie is great,but like all Godzilla movies it has its moments.The last villan coolest monster in my opinion is Space Godzilla. The worst part was the M.O.G.E.R.A vs Space Godzilla."
1,What happened?,Spacegodzilla looks too fake with the crystals and Godzilla is fat. Baby godzilla is kinda cute for small kids but thism ovie reminded me too much of godzilla vs. Megalon becuase it had that campy humor of a space alien. Spacegodzilla was too easy to kill and should appear in more godzilla movies. Space godzilla should be redesigned with his crystals and fins. A little mOthra appears for little reason and the effects are horrible. What was Toho thinking with this story? It was presentated wrong and it lacked visual effects
2,terribe video quality and kinda boring movie too,"Do not buy the vhs version, its recorded on a cheap tape at EP mode! looks and sounds terrible. The movie is not the best of the new series, so get the DVD with the much better vs Destroyer."
1,this wreeks!,"One of the dullest of all godzilla films. the battles are extremly boring, all it is lots of explosions and some cheesy outer space effects. nothing at all special."
3,An OKAY film,"Godzilla cells are carried into space off of Biollante. The U.N.G.C.C. creates M.O.G.E.R.A. to fight Godzilla, but ends up fighting SpaceGodzilla instead. I've seen the Japanese version of this and it could do a little bit better."
5,one of best newer movies,"This movie was good, except for the fact that Little Godzilla looks like an overgrown green barney!The mousic during the first battle with Space Godzilla on the island really fit the movie. Must See!"
4,Big G's 40th Birthday!,"Arguably the best Heisei Godzilla movie to date. The Special Effects were kinda lame, though. Besides that and the fact that Spacegodzilla looks really fake, this movie is a great way to celebrate 40 years of Godzilla! Long may he and his monster friends stomp!"
2,Only As A Supplement,"This book is okay, but I feel it is merely good as a supplement to books that offer more down to earth, plain as day explanations of 666. For example, there is an excellent book out there called 666 The Beast Revealed by Canyon Adams. I read that first actually,and then this one. Had I not read Adams' book first, I would have been either totally lost or totally fooled by this other book. But because I read The Beast Revealed first, I was able to cut through the ca-ca and see the information for what it is in this other book: some true, some partially true, some false. My suggestion is to read Adams' book first and then read this one."
1,What to do?,"OKay, I can understand some of you not liking this book for whatever reason. However, in a lot of these posts I see ""there are better books"". Well...LIKE WHAT??? You never tell us what books are better. Try to be more helpful next time please."
3,There are Better Works...,"Well, this book is most surely not an introduction to this view on prophecy. If this is your first time in studying prophecy, then I suggest that you don't buy it. I do agree that Papal Rome will play a bad part in end time events, but there are better books that hold more truth on that subject. The author is also very unspecific when talking about the ""70th week of Daniel."" If you are new, or just want something simple, try out Truth Left Behind by Steve Wohlberg. Now that is a good book."
1,You've got to be kidding!,"How does dreck like this ever manage to get published?Never before have I read such vacuous,ridiculous,laughable nonsense.As high comedy,this book hits the mark.As history,commentary or being in the same universe with reality, it is sad and pathetic.It did manage to get one thing right:that christianity is a sham.Strictly recommended for those confined to padded cells and fruitcakes hiding in the backwoods of Idaho, waiting for the apocalypse."
5,We both love it!,"Great item that my son just had to have, I had a terrible time in stores finding it in a full. We have been using it for a few weeks and it's a nice quaulity. Was delivered promptly, Would recommend to others!Thanks!"
2,Too Many Grammatical Errors to Take Seriously,"I am using this as a textbook in a class and throughout the first several chapters at least, there are NUMEROUS typos/grammatical errors. They are extensive enough that the articles just do not make sense. It is very distracting and it makes the reader question the validity of the content. I'm not sure if this is due to the compliation of the articles into the handbook or if the articles originally had these issues, but I do not recommend this text for classroom use. I hope they fixed these issues in the new edition."
2,Torn used Library Book,Soc of Mental Health book was a library book with ripped binding inside the book and it was not in the condition as stated. I would not have purchased this book for $2.00 but I decided to take it anyway. Very disappointed since I have had good results from most of my Amazon purchases.
2,cactus,it died a week after i got it and they are small mine looked nothing like the picture other then it was packed really well
4,A practical guide to DSC,"This book is a useful and clearly written practical guide for a technique that is becoming more important for more people as the years go by. If I do have to get critical, I could say that its price is rather high for its size. Although it contains a few references to modulated DSC I would gladly see a second edition that incorporates that side of the story in detail precisely because this new development is revolutionizing the DSC field as we speak. It will make it even broader than it already is and the new users need a book that allows them a good and easy path in. Another thing that is missing is the subfield of microcalorimetry (on protein solutions etc).The explanation of deconvolution techniques is rather meager because the authors find fourier transforms (too?!) daunting. Otherwise: a fine book"
1,Garbage,"Wow, this is a piece of garbage. I probably could have sewn one like this myself. If I Velcro it shut where the Velcro is, it's loose and strange. Unfortunately the Velcro is only a tiny little square, so if your hand isn't the exact lumpy clown size that your glove is, you're out of luck.My fiancee tried it on too (she is a very different size from me). She called it ""A dollar store Halloween costume glove with two fingers chopped off."""
2,Mizerak Billiard Glove,"After one week the wrist band is threaded! Also, size was not made clear. I do not think it will hold up very long."
2,Low quality.,"When Sony made battery holds charge for 7 days, this one holds only 1-2 days charge. Just pay more for Sony made one. It is worth it."
3,auto cad 2002 complete,"The note on Introduction page three it's written"" you can load files from this book from Sybex's website [...]. Search for ""Autocad 2002 Complete"" to locate this file"". However I have been looking for these files and do not appear in anyplace. Where shall I look for them so I can do the exercises on the book speccially 11.36 and followings where suddenly from nowhere appear a table, lamp, walls, etc.I appreciate if you give a hintManuel Cossio"
3,Ripper Rides Again,"This is an interesting but not outstanding, Jack the Ripper story. Ripper, the serial killer who was never identified, killed about five prostitutes in the Whitechapel section of London during the late 1880s. This has led to a cottage industry of articles and books, fictional and non-fiction, supposedly revealing who the Ripper really was.This Sherlock Holmes film is surely entertaining, following faithfully the characters developed by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. True to form, Holmes discovers that the Ripper is a member of the nobility. After all, it would have been far less interesting if this serial killer had been a butcher, baker, or local trash collector."
4,Sherlock Holmes VS The Ripper... A Study in Terror!,"Although ""A Study In Terror"" is over 30 years old now, terror still lurks in this frightening film. Together with Dr Watson, Sherlock Holmes is investigating the case of Jack the Ripper, slayer of 7 prostitutes of Victorian London. And his search shows some surprising results... An excellent British feature, with some gruesome moments. In the UK it costs 10 ($17.50), but if you like the sound of it and you live in the US, buy it anyway."
3,Lady lovely Locks and the pixietails,I really like the movie but It was the same one that I had ordered. It was vol.#2. I think the sellers of older video's need to look into the vol.#'s and list them. We gave it to a family member since we had a copy.
2,To difficult for dummies,"This was not for dummies, I found it difficult to follow and to look up specific problems. Did not care for this book. Not too helpful"
5,RELAXING!! TRANQUIL!!,"Sparkling blue waters crested with crystal foam roll gently up to white sandy beaches as the delicate melody of a singing flute weaves its magical harmony in and out of the music of the sea. You are at one with the waves, the sunshine, the languor of gentle breezes.You relax and dream, in turn with nature, all senses refreshed and tranquil. The sounds of the sea and the flute gently enfold you in a soothing embrace, creating your own special time of release and rejuvenation.If you love the sounds of nature and the ocean, you will love this!"
5,Wild and Wacky Totally True Bible Stories,"I loved this book. My 6,8 & 9 year olds enjoy the bible stories. Frank Peretti has a wonderful sense of humor and makes the bible stories come alive."
2,Boring!,The book started quite good. But then it's just anecdotes after anecdotes. That's very boring to read for me. I think Brian Fagan writes books by inserting snippets of facts he's learned in his career as a professor. I was expecting something more profound and scholarly from a professor of history at UCSB.
3,a good companion to the video,"Normally I say I always like the book better than the movie, in this case the documentary, but I do prefer the video on this one. The book is still interesting, informative and thought provoking though."
3,imbalance,"Interesting with several unique approaches. The problem for me rests with his intricate explanations of causes of climate changes from North Atlantic Oscillation,Sun spots,solar flares, ocean currents, polar melting, volcanoes. methane release, and a host of other causes. Yet,he speaks in unsubstantated conviction that todays warming is due to mans fossil fuel use. Then he concludes with ""The Little Ice Age reminds us that climate change is inevitable, unpredictable, and sometimes vicious.I would ask him does he believe this is really caused by man?"
1,Almost incomprehesible,"This book is quite poorly written.The first chapter 'Medieval Warm Period' opens somewhere on an ice packed sea in current time. The author, apparently a sailor, tells us not of period sailing but of his own experiences on icy waters, then drifts back in time, then forward in time then who knows where in time. There is no anchor in this book, you never really know where you are or where you're going. Annoying, perhaps, off-putting, absolutely.Since it is so poorly written, reading this book is hard work and dipping in and out of chapters it was clear that I wouldn't come away with a sense of what the little ice age was all about. So I went no further, although find the subject interesting, reading it was an unpleasant chore.I hope someone with a sense of story telling wrote or will write one. This isn't it."
1,Dilettante's work,"I have seldom read in a book that claims to be scientific so much superficial rubish. Fagan has incursioned, once again, in the difficult field of climatology and has done the accustomed bad job of a person who does not understand the complex mechanisms of the atmosphere. Popularizers like him who try to capitalize on the attraction of themes dealing with climate variation are littering a discipline that used to be respectable."
3,Nice Enough Little Book,"If you're looking for a profound re-examination of climatic history, then this isn't it. The book is more a listing of (interesting) facts, with some insight into the way Europeans have lived in the past 700 years. It's certainly an interesting read, but the book is mostly a summary of other sources. This is a library book--not one to keep.Don't listen to those who complain about the ""bad science."" There's very little science of any sort in the book, and his chapter about global warming is a standard summary of the situation."
2,Disappointing,"This is a poorly edited book marred by repetitive treatment of topics. It is also weak on the description of how conclusions, often startling and counterintuitive, were reached by scientists."
3,"Interesting History, Lousy Science","Fagan rambles, digresses and frustrates but manages to captures a great deal of information about the weather's impact on Western Civilization during the last 2300 years. The evidence that local climate may change quite rapidly is compelling. He jumps to unsupportable conclusions about what this evidence implies about future world climate. As a professional meteorologist I find his history interesting; he should leave the science to others."
3,Quilting In The Dark,"This piece included a fascinating collation of glimpses of selected economic, social and agricultural circumstances of the past,as they were perhaps related in some degree, to regional weather patterns. However, the author failed to achieve a flow to his efforts and instead produced a repetitious and unsteady pace. I am still skeptical regarding his seeming ability to produce a weather map showing high- and low-pressure areas with the ease of today's hourly televised forecasts. I was also disappointed that he elected to write with an air of authority while making assumptions that are as yet unsubstantiated by science; such as the overall effect of the Industrial Revolution on global weather patterns.Overall, an interesting but largely rhetorical book that would be a good basis for a lively classroom debate."
4,The little ice age in history,"Years ago when reading a biography about Francis Drake I learned about what scientist call today ""the little ice age"", since the western coast of North America was at the time of Drake particularly cold (around 1578). That period is interesting since is very unstable with predominating lower temperatures than the average and as you will read in this book, affecting lives the harsh way. So this book walk through that period narrating the difficult time the people had to endure -like famines, drought, calamities, extreme cold, illnesses, etc. The reason for that cannot be blame on human activities, like the lost of the Moche civilization two thousands years ago. In summary, if there is a conclusion from this book I would say it is the very difficult lives of our ancestors."
1,His rants and global warming scares make one question all of his work,"Some of the facts may be right but his historical conclusions are called into question after one reads his bias conclusions of global warming hysteria. Ironic after he spends the entire book talking about climate change over hundreds of years. One would think he had the idea that climate change is a constant and something that is not new or a problem isolated to the modern times. While certain facts are impervious to being twisted by an agenda, conclusions are not. Read with caution and knowledge of the writer's bias and agenda."
3,Disappointed but Looking Forward to Reading Fagan's Sources,"I have to say that I concur with a great deal of what the 1 and 2 star Reviewers have to say about this book.What did surprise me was that no one complained about Fagan's sources. They are all secondary and in some cases tertiary.This is not to say that they are wrong, only that Fagan has done nothing but compile information from a relatively small number of books.Having said that and the reason I gave the book 3 stars is that it provides a window into a fascinating past and provides what I consider to be a basic bibliography for further research.Best regards,James"
1,Self indulgent,Redundant and self indulgent. Ordered this book because of the good reviews. So disappointed. I am a Christian but not Catholic. Am assuming all the good reviews were due to their Catholic faith. The author came across as self centered and continuously repeated the same scenario. I thought the book might be about more than himself. Obviously I felt it was a bad decision to put this book on my iPad and will not sve it to share with my husband.
5,Keeping The Faith in Faithless Situations,"Fr. Gereon Goldmann takes you through life in Europe during WWII (and especially when serving in the German military). Goldmann proves to be faithful to God and his country, in spite of the hardships and trials. How easy it would be to despair when your own country accuses you of being a traitor, like Goldmann's country did. But remember, Germany was under the Nazi regime and naturally, if you stood for justice against prejudice, you were considered a traitor. Fr. Goldmann is ordained a priest while serving as a soldier and changes the lives of many while in combat. This edition takes you where the original story left off (it was origianlly published in 1964), and Fr. Goldmann moves on to minister in Japan."
5,"Excellent book, incredible story","Quite a remarkable story, if this was the premise of a movie I would dismiss it as being too outlandish but it is true.It is one of the most inspiring faith related stories I have read, right up there with ""With God in Russia"" by Walter Ciszek which I also read recently. Personally I am interested in reading about how Catholics live their faith through trying times and this is a great example of that.His emphasis on and faith in the power of prayer is a lesson to us all."
3,History of CDMA,Good general overview of how CDMA was born and the history that has lead the company up to this point. Needed more detail around the complexities of licensing CDMA technology and the behind the door events than transformed the industry. Too general in some senses but a good read for someone looking to understand the wireless business.
5,A good choice for my students!,"Dr. Parrillo's prior works have been excellent; this book is a perfect fit for a class I developed, and teach, at UNLV: Racial and Ethnic Groups of the United States. With its concise sociological construction, its thoughtful analaysis of the powers of prejudice, and its exploration of dominant-minority relations in millennial America, it makes excellent and informative reading for my students."
4,Oh Poppa Bear You Shouldn't Have,"The premise of this is pretty simple and written by Eve Bunting, Momma Bear would like to try out Valentine's over hibernation. So she does! For that she needs her Poppa Bear to wake up. Will he?Read the Valentine's Bear's to find out.There are few Valentines books but this one gets dutifully read each year. It is worn now and older like the owner and the children probably view both as relics but it is interesting to anthropomorphize the way through this mom bears hopes for a day when some bear says, I Love You with genuine chocolate ant eating sincerity.Good illustrations as ever."
5,Cute marriage love book for young and old.,"Mr. and Mrs. Bear usually hibernate through Valentine's Day. But this year, Mrs. Bear is determined to wake up and make the day a special one. When the alarm rings in February, she drags herself out of bed and starts to secretly make preparations while Mr. Bear snores away. Mrs. Bear writes loving Valentine notes. She digs up a pot of Mr. Bear's favorite honey, and fills a bowl with delicious dried bugs and beetles. She washes up in the chilly stream. When all is ready, Mrs. Bear excitedly goes to wake up Mr. Bear for their special day. But Mr. Bear proves to be harder to wake up than she thought. With loving humor and wonderfully detailed illustrations, this book will entertain children and adults alike with a story of a lovey-dovey, ""old married couple"" and their special day together."
1,Can't Make It Work,"I bought the book and looked forward to giving it to a friend as a present. Thinking I would sample it before I gave it away, I pumped in several of the web site addresses from different chapters of the book. Each time I got an error message indicating that I must try several corrective actions for success in my search. I tried them all, but with no result. Only the repetative error message. Hence I can say only ""Don't buy the book until you have tried it out.gregory208@aol.comGregory Coffin 2286 Longhorn Ave. Port St. Lucie, FL 34952"
4,"An interesting, educational book on a complex subject.","It is a great pleasure to read Dr. Philip Petersen's book ""The Quantum Tai Chi"" which explains the mystery of quantum physics and its connection with consciousness. It is a joy to see such a difficult subject so well explained with many common analogies. Nobody has ever done as much as Dr.Petersen to place Quantum theory within the grasp of common man. He uses his unequaled gifts to explain -understandable problems and makes them easily graspable. This smooth flowing, highly readable book is for everyone interested in Quantum Physics. It provides an intellectually stimulating, provocative, and gripping explanation of the subject with incontrovertible evidence. Petersen has taken the most complex victuals and made it a delicious desert. It is written with far-sightedness, imagination, thought and inspiration to make everyone think. To read it is to be engaged in a cerebral tennis contest."
2,"What do you mean to say, Dr. Author?","I have not completely read this title, nor do I think that I ever will. If you have an extra clothespin Dr. Author, I could use it on my nose! Extremely piecemeal without an inkling as to how Everything can be accounted for in one equation. It's about time one of you physicists encapsulates the whole of creation from a Top-Down perspective so we too can understand the essence of Unitary Covariance."
1,ROCKY ON BLU-RAY? ... NOT YET.,"BUYERS BEWARE!!!ROCKY: THE UNDISPUTED COLLECTION on Blu-ray... Just a bad joke.When I buy a Blu-ray, of an old or new movie, I expect to see Blu-ray video quality... Restored, Remasterized, or maybe a well donde / good video transfer... But this is not the case.I know, they are an old movies, but I have older movies than this one with much better look.The video quality on this movies are so much grainy... Worst than an old dvd... There are not restored, there are not remasterized... Rocky, the undisputed collection is about how to make an awful work, just to sell and play with memories.I don`t return this item because I don`t live on USA, and return cost is higher than the product`s itself.If you are looking for the Rocky movies on Blu-ray... There are not exist yet. Keep your dvd edition. It looks better.Another fail besides Highlander and Crash on Blu-ray... The same problem."
1,agree with other one star reviews,"The comments in the other one star reviews are correct. Don't waste your money on this ""bluray"" set. My Rocky vhs tapes are better quality."
1,Blu-Ray Review,Yet another so called Blu-Ray release from MGM Fox that is Terrible. I am sending my copy back to Amazon for a Full Refund. This is Absolutely Unacceptable. Thank God I didn't trade-in my Standard Collection. Fox continues to be the Worst Studio when it comes to Blu-Ray.
3,AMAZON PRICING?,I used to order ALL of my titles from Amazon. Used to. I have been just picking them up at Walmart for the same price or even a little cheaper. Since Amazon likes to screw the customers that PRE ORDER what is the point? The last few months they sell their new titles a few dollars more to the PRE ORDER folks then drop the price a day later to new orders. Fool me once or twice... I guess I don't need to be a PRIME MEMBER anymore either!
4,Sketchy shipping terms,"I was disappointed to pay extra for faster shipping only to find out afterwards this is when it would SHIP and NOT when it would be delivered. Lost a star for sketchy wording of shipping terms. Otherwise, great series, no problems with the product!!! I've always loved Rocky and was excited to find the blu-ray box set."
4,Great value for Rocky collection,"I bought this for my father's birthday. The order arrived in good time. The price was very reasonable for all six in the collection. Bought this in blue-ray because it was so much cheaper than dvd. Since he still hasn't gotten his new blue-ray machine connected, I'm not sure if they work. But bought them new, so I don't expect a problem."
5,The Undisputed Rocky Collection,"If your a Rocky Balboa fan, then this is the video collector's item for you. I could go on and on about the great Rocky movies, but as a fan you already know all that. Enough said."
5,Memories,"I was 11 years old when ""Rocky"" was made, but I didn't actually see it or any of the sequels till I was 19. Back then you could only get the movies on VHS or Beta tapes... Ok, I know I am dating myself!!My third son is our resident 'tech-guy' and hates watching ""grainy, fuzzy television."" He would almost rather not watch at all than watch an old video tape, so I ordered this set to try to update my movie collection.The evening after these movies arrived, my sons started watching the series all over again. It brought back fond memories... They loved these films as they were growing up!The price of the set was too good pass up and the picture quality is good enough to get my son's stamp of approval... That says it all!"
2,3 bluray doesn't work properly,"I bought this expecting a great product,but I was wrong...I'm a big fan of this kind of movies, this set includes 7 disk.For my surprise 3 of then doesn't work.Rocky 1,2,3 and the bonus disk work great.Rocky 4,Rocky 5 and Rocky Balboa this 3 disk are damaged, I am very disappointed with this purchase.I'm from Costa Rica and return the product is a little expensive"
4,Rocky box set review......,I purchased this item because I'm currently trying to build my blue ray collection and I figured you couldn't go wrong with a box set of rocky movies. I've always liked the rocky movies and the sale price on this was pretty good for a blue ray set. I am currently an amazon prime member so the two day shipping on items is awesome. Love this set but gave 4 stars in the review because my case was scratched when it got here. I've shipped several things back to amazon before because of this though and didn't ask for a replacement this time. Just didn't pay attention the day the item arrived and request a replacement.
5,Great experience!!! ROCKY ROCKS!!!,"Produc shipped in a good amount of time, and it was free. Best price I found for what I bought. Overall, very happy with my experience with amazon so far. Looking Forward to purchasing more off the the website, I've already re-ordered the AVATAR bluray/DVD combo."
4,Rocky Marathon,"If you love Rocky, underdog movies, set aside a weekend with lots of soft drinks and popcorn. This is a marathon that will knock you out!"
2,Movie is fine but disc won't play in Blu-Ray ...,"Had to play this on my New Windows 8 Media Center PC because my pretty new Samsung Blu Ray player just has no idea what to do with this disc for some weird reason.Very strange and I've probably played 1,000 Blu Ray discs in my Samsung and never had an issue.Even playing this on Windows 8 was a bit tricky as I had to download codecs, etc."
3,"Amazing Movie, Terrible Blu ray Transfer!!","First off let me just clear up one thing, Rocky movies are one of my personal favorites!! I love every single one of them with exception to 5 which i thought was just bad! But my rating of 3 stars is strictly on this bluray transfer which i personally think is an insult to such a great franchise. The quality on these movies are terrible for being what it is, as far as the franchise on its own i give it 5 stars! Definitely worth the upgrade to bluray if your looking for slightly better quality but if you have just regular dvd's the difference is not overwhelming. Also the menu's in these movie are the cheapest ive seen for being bluray transfer's except number 6 (R.Balboa) which on every level was better including menu and special feature's and quality!!!"
5,Great value,having this entire movie collection on blu-ray for $20 was a steal! And the receipient of the gift was just as ecstatic!
3,blu ray,I continue to recieve quality product and service through Amazon. The blu ray quality of this was not as good as I had hoped. It's not much cleareer than the DVD's.
4,Undisputed Collection is very good...just not Definitive,"By now everybody knows the inspirational underdog story of Rocky Balboa. You'd have to have a heart made of stone not to feel for the wonderful character played perfectly by Sylvester Stallone. And while the overall quality of these six films may vary, the heart and character does not.This blu ray release is very good but with a few caveats. First off, the original needs (and deserves) a restoration along with a more beefy extras package. Some extras from the DVD didn't make it (inexcusable really), while Rocky 2-5 deserve a little more love too. I wouldn't expect full restorations, but surely an audio commentary for each isn't too much to ask.We may have to wait for Rocky: The Definitive Collection."
1,2 of the same dvd in package,I have 2 of the same rocky 3 in the dvd box and no rocky 2 in the dvd box.
5,Absolutely Love It!!!,I got this for my husband who owned all the original DVDs and he is so much happier with the Blu-ray discs. Picture is so much better!! Big plus for us is everything is one package so we didn't have to have 6 different Blu-ray cases.
2,Rocky I-IV is not blu-ray quality!!!,"The picture on these are so grainy on my 60"" plasma that it looks like I'm watching Rocky on VHS! The first four Rocky movies look worse than their DVD counterparts. Save your money and buy the set on DVD if you don't own them yet, or wait and pray a remastered blu-ray set is released in the future."
4,"Old Classic, New Format",This is bascially the VHS on Blu-Ray. Good though and the last movie is actually in Blu-Ray format. But can't complain. Remeber when these were originally made.
4,Lousy Video Quality for Blu-Ray,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.I got a real good deal on this package through Amazon.com, so I can't complain too much.The video quality of the first five Rocky movies is not very good. Some of the worst grain I have seen on Blu-Ray. The 6th movie, Rocky Balboa, had better video quality (not great, but good), but instead of having DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio like the first 5 movies, it only had Dobly Digital 5.1. It isn't a major complaint, since there is some great sounding DD 5.1 soundtracks, but it was surprising."
4,For my other half,I could care less for these movies but my boyfriend loves them so I bought it for him for Christmas. First movie we watched I noticed and heard sound effects never able to hear before. My boyfriend is a happy camper too! It also takes up less space. This is a great surprise gift for any Rocky fan.
5,What a deal!,"The product arrived fast and packaged well. It comes with all 6 Rocky movies on BluRay plus a bonus disc of special features. Movies look great on BluRay, it's like watching Rocky for the first time all over again :D"
5,Goooooooood price,"Christmas gift. I found it very expensive in differents stores. Very good price. My son just, love it. He watch it more than one. Get it on time. Just great."
5,Who doesnt love Rocky?!,Im so excited to be able to have a rainy day movie thon with all the Rocky's. Great movies at a great price!
5,rocky,I just love most of the Rocky's but the price for this collection to have all of them including the new one I just couldn't pass up. could have done without Rocky V and the street fighting but rocky one through 3 are great.
1,The Cover/Package was Completely damaged,"When I got this package, the Bluray disk cover was broken and damaged. I was planning to return it but never got to it."
1,Don't buy it - Big mistake,"First, because I live far away in South America, I received this item many montha after I bought it. By the time I tried it, the Return authorized date was expired.Why ""Don't buy it"", because my computer (brand new with Windows 7 and Blu Ray DVD player included) does not read all the 5 CDs included in this ROCKY collection box. You can imagine How disappointed I was !The other problem is I wrote at least 3 times to the seller to explain the problem see if he could help me out a bit - NEVER got one answer from him. Does not care. This seller should be eliminated from Amazon.com. Then I tried by myself : tried all the possible troubleshooting proposed by Amazon: downloaded new firmware, trying everything they say, calling HP support (my computer is HP), everything for days and days...still no result.I gave up and therefore I lost about 80 dollars (because there was costly international shipping).AGAIN, DO NOT BUY ANYTHINGFROM THIS SELLER - NO HELP, DOES NOT CARE A BIT"
3,Rocky Deserved better than this,"The Movies are Immortal ok save for Rocky V Rocky V was a mess and Rocky IV as much as we all love it...is a joke. But Hey Rocky I-IV Immortal tales of rising up digging deep and while you get beat down...keep getting up and never give in!MGM never got the memo and thus when the movies were transferred to HD they suffered more grain than a Cambodian rice patty. While there is an extras disc alot of DVD extras didn't make the way over.But this is as good as the immortal movies are going to look unless MGM takes time to clean up the originals and do a remaster for a future anniversary.If you want rocky looking the best he ever has...wait. But if you need your Rocky Fix or want to teach you children how to step it up and never back down. Well no brainier buy this set.Rocky deserved better than this. A remaster of Rocky I-IV and Balboa no Rocky V (NOBODY wants Rocky V) with commentaries for each film would be perfect but for now, if this is all we get I'm semi satisfied."
5,Perfect Collection,"Great packaging, great quality, great ports. Plenty of accessibility options for each Blu-Ray. I bought on sale for $20, one hell of a deal."
3,Bad Disc,"I recently received the Blu-Ray box set collection of the Rocky movies for Christmas and was very happy to receive them until I began to watch them. Upon viewing Rocky II, the disc seemed to be corrupted. During the beginning of round 2 of the final fight between Rocky and Apollo, the disc stops and the movie becomes distorted where the movie stopped. I cleaned the disc and the player, but it stops at the same spot at approximately an hour and 45 minutes in to the movie. There is no scratch on the disc. I am wondering how I go about replacing the disc. If it wasn't for that disc, I would have given this Blu-Ray 5 stars."
5,Oh yeah!,I had seen bits of each movie but there was nothing like being able to own it and watch it on my own time..its an amazingly inspirational story....the price was great the fact that it was bluray was a plus and i liked that each movie had its own space in the case...i bought a trilogy one time where all three or four movies were stacked one on top of the other...so we plan on havibg these movies in great shape for a long time ....thanks amazon...once again a satisfied customer
4,Best Rocky Collection Yet!,"This collection of the ""Rocky"" movies are awesome. People should know that all movies are put in one case. So there aren't six cases in this box, there's only one. Nice huh? Including that there is a bonus disc with special features. All six movies were put into the blu-ray format, but the older ones(the first couple) seem to have some grainy textures in the background in some scenes. The sixth movie does not have that problem though. If you like the ""Rocky"" movies you should buy this collection"
1,not a good book by Lem (who is a great writer),"I'm a big fan of Lem but I have to admidt he has churned out some bad books. I have read all but two all of Lem's books and this is among his worst (along with Chain of Chance, Eden, the Investigation). Its boring, short, and no way worth [that much money] Instead start out with one of his 5-star books: His Master's Voice, Star Diaries, Fiasco, or Pirx the Pilot."
2,Memoirs found in a bathtubb,Less than average reading. Somewhat interesting at first but than just never goes anywhere. Interest in this type of writing is hard to understand.
5,Unusually warm,"This has to be one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. Marilyn Hassett is so appealing as the sweet but very unhappy Jill Kinmont, the one who wrongly comes to believe that she is a ""jinx"" to others around her; in a sense she blames herself for the death of her father and her first lover. Timothy Bottoms, in perhaps in best role, plays the part of a person unhappy himself, thanks to a previous unfortunate, failed relationship. The two come to realize that they cannot do without each other, both feeling so much void in their lives and each finding in the other the one that can fill the void. I choke up thinking about this wonderful movie. The California scenery was beautifully breath-taking and, again, the story was heart-warming."
3,Other Side of the Mountain 2,Other Side of the Mountain 2 was a little boring compared to The Other Side of the Moutain. It was still a good movie though.
1,Horrible Sequel,"I hated this, if you liked the first this is a complete waste of your time. It seems to have nofactual basis and the film makers ruined it."
1,Careful,"Speaking with a year and a half of experience with this product, you'd be well advised to look elsewhere. Unless, of course, you enjoy trying to get the attention of Tech Support, doing firmware updates, and risking data."
2,Comfy But poorly made,"These shoes look great and are comfortable, but the little buttons break and the strap comes apart. After searching the internet I bought a few spare buttons, but we had to pay almost as much as the shoes cost. If you gotta have them they're not too bad, otherwise you may want to keep looking."
3,ok for the price,"Don't see these holding up very well, seem to show everything. but for the price, guess I will get some use out of them. I like the Betula's, but not the quality of Birks."
5,Birkenstock Betula Taupe Suede Clogs,"I just recently bought these on Ebay. They are comfortable, and they are made by Birkenstock, so you know you are getting an origininal item, just a less expensive price.I wear them alot, have been very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone."
1,Poor product that had to be repaired,"The shoes I ordered came 2 days after promised. Then to make matters worse the rivets holding straps on both shoes came off in transit. I had to pay shoe shop, 13.00 to repair in order to make Christmas obligations. I would not recommend purchasing shoes through Amazon. My book order shipping to my nephew in VA went very well, I should add. Kudos for books, thumbs down for Birks!!"
5,Great shoes,"These shoes are great looking, comfortable, and exactly what I was looking for. I recieved them quick with no problems. They cost a little more than what I was looking to spend, but worth it."
4,Not sure yet,"I just received these so they still have to ""break in"". However, I have to say that there is good news/bad news in regard to the company that supplied them (Midwest Sports). First good news- very prompt delivery, arrived in excellent condition, and a great price. Bad news- the pretty insane return instructions. You can't return them if there not in the exact original condition. This includes a plastic tie binding the two clogs together and they must not have been worn. Ok, how does a person know if something fits if they can't try it on? Doesn't really make a lot of sense."
2,Not What I Expected,"The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back. I had to sew the buckles back on. In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered."
1,Mine didn't work...,"Don't know why but mine didn't work for some reason. Too bad, as I was really looking forward to this type of style, especially if you travel allot w/your laptop. Maybe I'll try again hoping this one was a lemon."
5,Saved my Laptop,This little unit is small and can be left attached to your power cord. It works too. I was at a lodge with bad wiring (that I didn't know about). I plugged in my laptop and it heard a crackle in the surge protector. Removed the laptop and noticed the unit had saved my computer form damage. The bad wiring also killed a hair dryer. I lost another laptop to a surge a couple years ago and I wish I had used one of these back then.
2,does what it's supposed to...acts weird with dell power supply though,"if i have this plugged in to my dell power supply when i turn on my laptop, i get an error message before the computer will boot saying something about not being able to identify the power adaptor...you can hit a key and the computer will continue to boot, and everything works fine, but it's just annoying / weird that it acts like that."
2,Very disappointed!,"I bought the item because of the title: ""Anger Management Tour."" I was very disappointed with it. The title caught my eye because I am looking for videos or dvd presentations on anger management. As a professional, I could never use it as part of my presentations to children or adolescents regardless of who might be familiar with the item. For one thing too much profanity and songs that are not impressive to me. What is the message in it? Very disappointing to me! I will either return it (if possible) or just trash it."
5,Great DVD!!! Unedited!!!!,"I bought this DVD the day it was released at Best Buy. It is a great DVD!! The version that I bought is unedited. So that review a few before mine is completely WRONG!! If you buy a copy without a Parental Advisory, of course it's gonna be edited, that's why you have to make sure it has a Parental Advisory sticker on it. This DVD is a MUST HAVE for ALL Eminem & D12 fans!! Obie Trice is even on the DVD! It's great. Deffinatly, go buy it."
2,Editing EMINEM,"Normally, I'd give any Eminem product 5 stars, hands down. However, due to the fact that this DVD is completely edited (they blur out Em giving the middle finger...), I'm being generous giving it 2 stars. All curse words are mudded up, any image that is he slightest bit obscene is blurred out. Seriously, what is the point of editing an Eminem concert? The freestyles make absolutely no sense, due to the fact that you can only hear about 5% of the lyrics. I understand that some viewers are sensitive, but the product description should boldly state that this DVD is edited! I had no idea and am extremely disappointed."
4,Awesome DvD!!!nice job Em!!!,"This DvD is worth buying, it's price is good and considering it's entertainment the show was awesome and all the songs are great.There is only one little thing that i wanted, I wanted more songs from the eminem show and another thing was that it was only an hour and something long, but on the whole it was great 4/5!!!!"
3,Good Children's Book or Collectors Series,"Book is very nice, but be prepared for a very small book for the price.I have now bought three books from this author and all the books cost me a small fortune,but my husband is a Capt. on our city's fire dept and also on the bomb squad so he collects these things. There are very few pages in this book and they are more like the children's ""Golden Books"" thats how small the book is. When paying over 20.00 some dollars for the books I was expecting a much bigger book for my dollar. Just be aware of what your getting. If its worth it for you, then the money is not an issue.Again for me my husband collects them, but I thing if he knew how much I paid for them he would even be disappointed.Added note: I would say the ages for this book would be eight years on up????"
1,Where's the beef?,"Considering the fact that the world's busiest and best bomb squads were never even mentioned or covered in this book (New York, Israel Police, British Army Northern Ireland, Spanish EOD squads, French Police demolitions units, and German bomb techs), this coverage is missing the ""big bang!"""
4,Evil women... or just misunderstood?,"I found this paper doll book rather amusing and informative. Despite the fact that the dolls are in black and white, they are beautifully drawn and detailed. I was pleased to find that listed below each drawing is the source of the dolls attire, be it from a painting, woodcut, or photograph. Historical information on each of the notorious women is also provided, allowing you to learn not only how these women looked, but how they lived and earned their place in infamy."
2,Infamous Women,"I found this subject fascinating and the biographical notes were written in an entertaining, tongue in cheek style.Unfortunately the quality of the illustrations was extremely disappointing. The dolls look as if the illustrator traced their images from photos of statues, reliefs, portraits, etc.Also, the quality of the paper is poor and printed on both sides, so by cutting out the dolls one would cut up the text on the reverse page.I wish I'd read the other customers reviews before purchasing this book, because in the publisher's product description there wasn't a single mention of the fact that this is a coloring book."
3,This in not a coloring book!,"This is a book of paper dolls, with a short history accompanying each conniving, shrewd, calculating, dangerous woman. I thought the stories were very interesting, but I did not want a paper doll book. The illustrations are fair. This was bought as a humorous birthday gift for a mature friend. I would not think it's appropriate or readable for a female under the age or 13. I really wish it had actually been accurately described (as paper dolls) although a couple of the reviewers did state as much, so my lack of attention to their reviews places the blame mainly on me!"
3,"looked good, but was incredibly rough and itchy","I could dress my son in long sleeves and pants so the suit was fine, but he couldn't tolerate the itchiness of the cap part--it was really scratchy and itchy. It was cheap, though."
3,Mixed opinion on this one....,"This series caught my eye because I have liked most everything I've seen starring Ciaran Hinds. While I thought the acting lived up to the other work I've seen him in, I felt like the storyline didn't develop the characters as richly as I would have liked. If just finding out the ""whodunit"" of it all is the main thing you're looking for, this will likely satisfy. If you like to watch the complexities of the characters and their relationships come out at a pace that builds and really draws you into their world, I felt this was slightly disappointing. The chemistry is good between the two leads, but I felt the storyline was rushed at times and left you hanging and wanting more and then didn't really deliver at other times. It's also quite expensive with only 2-3 episodes per season, but I thought it was still worth watching and am glad amazon is making some of these shows available that we can't watch any other way in the U.S."
1,Misinformed,"Go to page 266, second paragraph ""As a Baha'i, he (Shah of Iran) was hostile to Shiite traditionalism..."" For your information Mr. Kolko, Shah was not a Bahai. He was actually a devout Shia. And the reason he advanced women's rights in Iran was because he was a ""social progressive"" not because he was a Bahai. Do your research before writing a book."
2,ok,"The blu Ray I bought skipped, but considering I only paid like $5 for it. I decided not to bother returning it"
2,The effects are so cheesy that it mars the movie,"Look, this flick is totally campy and preposterous. But I'm not going to let that impact me. Since this is derived from a heralded animated series, that has quite a following, I'm going to give a pass to issues of plot and character development. What irked me about this semi-entertaining movie is the ridiculous overuse of quick edits and cartoonish special effects. Those extremely bothersome aspects makes this otherwise ambitious project look like a cheap TV show."
1,Dubbed Koyuki's Voice,"I like the movie so I'm not rating the movie at all. I am rating Sony's DVD release, which deserves 1 star. They DUBBED Koyuki's voice (the onigen lady) even though she is speaking English in the original filming. Yeah, her English isn't perfect but now with the dubbing it sounds totally terrible and FAKE! I noticed they also changed around some scenes of the movie, especially in the beginning. The end result is nowhere near as polished and fluid as the original. Find another DVD release, I went for Korean since the Japanese with subs is OOP."
2,Not my cup of Tea...or Sake for that matter,"I must admit that ""Blood - The Last Vampire"" is everything I read about, but it's not just my cup of Tea...or Sake for that matter. The film tries very hard to put the grips on you and keep your attention, but it really didn't hold on long enough to keep my interest. The sword play is way overdone...the special effects are low budget...and the script is basically non-existent. This would have been much better in animation...or for one to read in a comic book. Maybe I'm being a little unfair because I've seen so many films where everyone either chops someone's head off or splits them up the middle. Nothing special here...but a good flick for the novice of this genre."
2,Not what you would expect,"If you watch this movie after watching the original anime, you will be disappointed. I felt the SFX were shakey, sub-par and even unbelievable at times. There was a real lack of actual horrific looking vampires as they were drawn in the anime.The movie isn't really ""bad"" if you are watching it without watching the original anime but if you did, it will disappoint. There isn't much more to say.2 stars for the anime fan but I'd give it 3 if you have never seen any of the original works."
3,whaaaaaat,this movie kind of sucked. what in the hell was i think when i bought this. but on a lighter note. it had good action. the plot was kind of like missing something. but over all it was an ok movie. i wish that it just had more to it. also i should of bought the Anime series instead of this
3,"blood almost as good as the Anime""","To start off it was great production and really good retelling, not as good as the anime,but good enough i give it two thumbs up=)"
5,better then the anime,"The live action version of this movie thankfully adds a longer storyline. This movie is just as bloody as the anime, but has some wonderful use of color in many scenes. The acting was good as well as the fight scenes. All in all, I thought it was a very good movie, especially for those who liked the anime version."
5,"BLOOD, reigns...rains.","A fabulous film with great effects, stunning visuals awesome fight scenes and plenty of blood...spilled."
3,Remake that departs from original,"This is a live action remake of the original anime OVA. It closely adheres to the original movie and manga but then takes a different path during the second half of the movie which has nothing to do with Blood+. Story wise, its OK and the acting is also OK, but the effects are cheap CGI and look totally fake. The movie would be better if it look believable."
4,Blood Sucking Good!,"Blood is a great Live action take on the Anime Classic. Even if you haven't seen the original film, this film stands on it's own. The only flaws are that they refer to the vampires as demons and they don't show how bad it really was at the school. They do however flesh out Saya back story in greater detail. Excellent action and good special FX make this a must have for fans and new comers alike."
3,A fun japanese live action anime.,"Blood: The Last Vampire is based on a japanese OVA movie and series that doesn't stray too far from the source material. It has excellent fight sequences that do go a little overboard on occassion. The special effects are good in some places and very cheesy in other - mostly due to bad CGI. The story is good but it does ask the viewer to leave logic at the door and just go for the ride. And if you can, you will greatly enjoy the film. If not, don't bother with it.I you are a fan of japanese live action films or anime in general, pick it up. The Blu-ray has impressive picture and sound."
3,It was OK..,"Honestly, I was expecting a bit more, given that Sony Pictures was behind this movie. The story and actors were alright, but the film as a whole could have used better production values. Basically, it just suffered from sub-par special effects. I just expected more from Sony, given that they've invested quite a bit in the Blood franchise. If you don't expect too much from it, I suppose you won't be too disappointed."
3,"I will not be adding this to my personal collection, title is deceiving.","With a title like, ""Blood: The Last Vampire"" I was hoping for a good Vampire movie. Boy, was I disappointed. The plot was weak, the special effects were beyond unbelievable to silly, characters were not well developed. I love the Vampire genre, but this was not that. This was anime trying to be a something else."
2,Think I'll stick to the anime version...,"If you saw the original BLOOD anime, you probably won't dig this too tough. Think of the most cliche action stunts Hollywood comes out with and it's in here. Slow-motion? Check. Over the top battle scenes? Yup.This movie would be great to anybody who is easily entertained, I on the other hand have been spoiled by the flawless execution of the BLOOD anime. Flip a coin, it's a toss-up.Better yet, rent it."
2,Cliched,"Watching this movie I felt like I had seen it before. Yep, it has scenes similar to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hero"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", ""Ninja Assassin"". The plot is quite predictable. This movie is really unnecessary."
5,Excellent Work on Giannas Work,"Gianna Jun does a very good job, she is very focused in this movie. While she resembles a young girl, her character is that of a few Centurys. In this film, she would hold her youth very well while also holding on to much of her wisdom through those few centurys.Just Watch it....."
1,an abomination of a good anime,"director should be quartered and shot and the price of the bullet should be charged to the production company. I loved the stand alone anime and am a big fan of the series, but this movie sucks vampire member."
2,I really wanted this flick to be good...,"Unfortunately I can only rate this 2 stars. One, because I was able to watch the entire movie from beginning to end. Two, because Gianna Jun, the actress who played Saya, is absolutely beautiful.As far as the rest-- e.g. plot, camera work, acting, special effects...etc. I give it zero stars. I really expect so much more from a modern movie. Very disappointing!"
