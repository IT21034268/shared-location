4,"Primitive, but Riveting","This film has some laughable features technically, but it is not about sets. Well, maybe it is. The dreamy weirdness of this film is actually enhanced by some of its cheap technical features--its soundlot sets, rear-screen driving shots, the fog machine as director's fast friend. But ""Detour"" is finally about the faces of the lead actors. This is the ""Passion of Joan of Arc"" (I am thinking of the 1928 version, in which the camera dwells on faces for long, agonizingly beautiful takes) of B-noir."
3,"Little gem of a flix, Terrible DVD","Literally stumbled across this gem of a film. Talk about a guy who can't win for losing, and the other folks who described Vera as ""the woman from hell"" were right on target. The bad news is the this Alpha DVD is really really bad - the video is better than the audio, but that is faint praise. But the film itself is worth a repeat viewing."
4,Detour,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Disappointed,"I thought I was getting a good price for a great film. However, the digital transfer was horrible - which is probably why I got a bargain price. I would not recommend this film copy, nor will I purchase anything else from this company. What I learned from this purchase is always read the low rated reviews. Also, shop to see if there is a remastered edition - which there is."
4,Great B-Movie Noir,"This is a movie that should be horrible. It has almost no budget -- it feels like half the movie takes place in one hotel room. The acting is, well what can I say, unconventional. Ann Savage plays such an unrelenting b**ch it's hard to believe that she's actually acting. I mean, an actor would vary things a little, wouldn't they? She should be a camp icon. Tom Neal plays the noir ueber-schmuck with so much spinelessness you feel he deserves the horrible things that happen to him. And yet, somehow, it all works. It might be so bad it's good. Or it might just be good. I'm not sure. If you are a fan of Film Noir this is a must see."
5,Low-budget but highly influential and entertaining,"This film is has no real fat to trim--it's as lean and mean as they come. Sure, some of the acting is just okay--it was low-budget afterall--but it's a very entertaining, gripping story of an innocent guy caught up in circumstances beyond his control. It's dark, nasty, and offers no comfort to anyone. As Errol Morris has said of film noirs like this: ""You ask, 'Why are these bad things happening to me?' and the answer, the almost-unacceptable answer is, ""For no reason whatsoever""."
3,Good Stuff,"This is the classic of the classic noir movies. It's not particularly great and you don't wish that you could do a movie like it, but you will enjoy yourself as you watch the protagonist go from a hopeful shlub to a complete loser. Nothing goes right for this guy and I mean nothing, but the femme fatale is great."
1,Detour ...,"I am a great admirer of ""Detour"" which is probably the best low-budget film noir ever made. But this DVD is a piece of junk. It is transferred from a lousy, battered 35mm print that has badly spliced gaps and screwed-up film footage in crucial scenes, obliterating some of the best dialogue. The company that put this out should be ashamed of itself, especially considering this film is now considered a low-budget masterpiece. If you have no copy of this, get the Sinister Cinema VHS. It is a much higher quality print."
3,"Great movie, poor transfer to DVD","I love the way this story unfolds, in flashback, which is relatively common in film noir. This story opens with Neal looking back on events as they unfolded, similar to the way Fred MacMurray opens Double Indemnity with his narrative. The dialogue exchange between Neal and Savage is wonderful too, even hilariously unbelievable at times, like when they first meet. The only trouble I have with the DVD is that the master was apparently in sad shape. In more than a few places, it is apparent that this movie is in deperate need of a restoration. Several scenes have visual noise and thin vertical lines running across the frame. Even the audio fades and crackles at one point (where Neal and his girlfriend kiss goodbye), which is jarring when one considers this is a DVD. I do not regret buying this DVD because I love this moive--I only hope that it will be restored one day."
1,Take a detour away from this DVD,"I wasn't all that impressed with this movie, finding it too self-consciously ""noir-ish"" for its own good. But you know something? I'm going to give it another chance sometime in the future, as I can't help but feel that the reprehensible shape of the print used to make this DVD contributed to my lack of enjoyment of the story. In fact, it's like I haven't even SEEN the whole movie, as entire lines of dialogue were missing every few minutes, accompanied by horrible splices. Trust me, stay away form this particular DVD and wait for someone to release a print of it that's at least watchable."
4,How to make a movie for nine dollars...,"This is the ultimate Grade Z film noir, and a great primer on how to make a no-budget film. The whole thing is as fascinating to watch for the way it was filmed and put together as it is to watch the story unfold. A couple of great performances from nobodies, an object lesson on why you should NEVER assume a dead guys identity, and an almost Grecian sense of fate and tragedy. This holds up as well as Gun Crazy, as there are parts of both movies that seem so electrifyingly contemporary that it is startling. Buy a copy for yourself, and get a couple for your friends..."
4,NOIR AT IT'S DARKEST,"Come on, it doesn't get cooler than 'Detour'! No budget, no stars, and a wacked-out story of hellish bad luck. Tom Neal is what passes for our hero, a pianist en route to the coast to meet up with his girl when 'fate sticks out a foot to trip him'. It's really amazing to see how great this thing turned out considering how little it had going for it. Watch it at like 3 a.m., when everything is a little foggy, and you'll appreciate it even more. Then, watch 'D.O.A.', and 'He Walked By Night'."
3,great music!--poor sound!,"""reflections"" by julius hemphill et al is great,wonderful music----but my copy of this album (published by ""freedom"") has very serious technical sound problems with at least one of the pieces---on ""the hard blues"", a wonderfully funky & vibrant repeating line is continually botched in sound editing everytime it recurrs: voices are dropped out or muffled & the stereo mix is always screwed up----granted, this is on only one track, & in only one (repeated) section of this track----but it is the best, or most dynamic piece on the album & the extremely distorted passages really marr the enjoyment of the whole piece---unless ""freedom"" gets it's act together & corrects this dub problem (not on the originals), i'd recommend most customers stay away from this particular re-issue, unless they dont mind listening to classic music getting mangled---especially considering the high prices that are being charged for this very defective item."
1,Recieved Warped Twice,"When I received this product, it arrived warped and useless. I re-ordered it, and it again arrived warped and useless. My only suggestion to those who would like this product is to order it with a number of other cake rings. Maybe if they come together, they will protect themselves."
1,"Not round, more of an oval","When I got this ring, the first thing I noticed right away was that it was not round. It had a flattened side and it was unusable. It also had some minor scratches."
5,Really great product!!!,Very sturdy and well-made. I have been looking for a good cake ring and have finally found this heavy-duty one that will last me many years to come; I will definitely be ordering more Fat Daddio's products!
3,Broad and generic in approach... not enough 'life' to this book...,"This is a brief 126 page book which looks at the Baptist faith tradition, for those who are not familiar with it and want to learn some very basic history and information about Baptist faith practices. Because it was presumably written to be used in a small group setting it works for that purpose, esp. I think if the group is led by a person experienced in the Baptist denomination who can 'flesh"" out the course with more interesting examples from real church life. I thought the book dealt fairly with the split between the Southern Baptist Convention and American Baptist Churches USA (the latter of which my church, Riverside in NYC) is affiliated with, as well as the United Church of Christ denomination."
2,a bit slow,"ok so the story line was pretty good, and wells did a great job of making joseph smith out to be an absolute nut job, which he probably was, but i wonder if she took it a bit far. but it was just way to slow. if she had done a better job getting your interest in the beginning i might have given it 3 or 4 stars but she didnt so 2 stars is as good as it gets."
1,Anti-mormon literature takes a new form,"A surprising book because it takes anti-mormon literature into a new form: the novel. I was greatly distressed that Bethanyhouse would publish such a blantently anti-mormon work. The book deals with a inquisitive young girl named Jenny who becomes attracted to Mormonism. The book depicts Joseph Smith as a lewd, lazy, money-digging bad guy, who used the people to get power for himself. It is a very nasty bit of fiction."
3,Kind of Cryptic,The authors present symbols without saying what they mean or how to read them. I had similar material in a previous class and it was much easier to understand simply due to writing style.
3,Mixed Bag,"I have to truly say that I have mixed feelings about this one. It provides an eye opening view into the use of Bushido, beyond dry tellings of it's core beliefs. The Hagakure puts fire behind these beliefs and tells anecdotes reflecting this philosophy. The flip side of this is that Tsunetomo could truly be called a psychopath. One anecdote told of his walking down a crowded city street one day when his purse was stolen. Not seeing who had stolen it, he whipped out his katana and killed everyone within 10 feet to be sure that he got the cutpurse. I have to say that anyone interested in the study of Bushido, Budo or just Japanese history in general should buy this book. If you are looking for wisdom in these pages, take everything with a grain of salt. A big one. Think the size of your head."
4,An accessable understanding of the Bushido,"The Hagakure explains the Japanese warrior code (Bushido) simply and elegantly, and in a much more accessable manner than ""The Book of the 5 Rings,"" considered THE authority on the subject. The observations, thoughts and reflections of the author reflect the Zen aspect of the samurai code (""a samurai should reflect daily and in the most graphic manner his demise""), as well as the strong Confucian influence on Japanese culture (the tale of his Master, Nabeshima Mitsushige, covering his face with his sleeve in order not to see his men flustered when a wounded boar lunged at a hunting party) in addition to the crisis of peace the samurai faced under the Tokugawa Shogunate (providing advice on how to practice severing heads on the condemned.)All in all it was fascinating, and a marvelous ""picture in time."" I recommend this before reading Sun Tsu (""The Art of War"") or Mushashi (""A Book of Five Rings."")"
5,good books,"I love this book.It is translated masterfully.Very easy to read,once you start you dont'want to put it down until you are finished.Anyone with even the slightest interest in eastern philosophy,eastern mysticysm should read this book."
4,An excellent almost poetic view of samurai thought.,A previous review spoke of the passages in this book being a bit odd. I belive this book is a great way of begining shaping the mind to be open to the Way of the samurai. It is also interesting to note that although the author was never in any actual battles. The greatest sword ever made was never intended on being used.
4,"A way of life long ago, but still usefull for today","The book of hidden leaves ""Hagakure"" expresses the view of a man who lived in a time three hundred years past, but his words are still valid and usefull in today's society. They preach the values of men who will succeed in life, and if you take time to think about it they are still applicable for a person in present-day. ""A samurai will use a toothpick even though he has not eaten. Inside the skin of a dog, outside the hide of a tiger."""
1,A very big disappointment,This is a great book however the problem lies with in ther traanslation. the problem is that only 300 of the 1300 phrases were translated. Although this translation gives the basic message that Master Tsunetomo was trying to get a cross you can not truly absorb thius book with out reading everything that Master Tsunetomo intended you to read. Also the entire 5th chapter is left out of this translation. I would recomend to everyone to find a better translation than this one.
5,A classic!,"This is one of the best historical texts available on the subject of Japanese warrior philosophy. While many of its practices seem alien to the 21st century reader, there is still much wisdom to be found here. I have read this book many times over the years. I will very likely continue to read it again and again.Bushido: A Modern Adaptation of the Ancient Code of the SamuraiMeditations (Penguin Classics)"
5,Ghost Dog,"This book has gained its notoriety from Jim Jarmusch's excellent movie ""Ghost Dog - The Way of the Samurai"". Personally, I would purchase this book anyway, because I'm fascinated about the samurai and their philosophy. I love it."
4,A Powerful Message,"The Hagakure is a mixed bag for the average reader- some of the contents are life changing and pensive, while others seem very out of place. Overall, it provides an excellent view into the way of life that was the Samurai. It had a profound impact in my daily life, and I would like to absorb more after another time through it."
5,Interesting,"I bought this book after seeing the movie ""Ghost Dog - Way of the Samurai"". I didn't really know what to expect, but the book has some very interesting aspects on life and ways to live, that still work extremely well in todays society. I have at many times found myself in situations described in the book and even though some answers might be a bit hard to understand, the book has given me answers, or perhaps ways to answer/respond, in different situations. It's not really a book you read from cover to cover, but pick up and read a couple of ""rules"" every now and then, which after a while are in the back of your head, ready for use.I highly reccommend this book to pretty much every one."
4,A book by a samurai for a samurai,"This book is great for the aspiring martial artist or even someone who just likes to learn about what feudal Japan was like through the eyes of one of it's warriors. Myself being a student of kenjutsu (Art of the Sword), could relate to a lot of what Yamamoto was saying, and apply it to my everyday life. This isn't a story with a beginning, middle, end and a plot, however it is more of an instructional book from a retired samurai to a younger samurai eager to learn. Yamamoto focuses on methods of how a samurai should act at all times and in different circumstances as well as recounting some stories of past samurai and daimyo (feudal lord). A good buy, definately."
4,This is the Secret to the Farmer's Almanac,"The first section on weather proverbs was great fun. I have experienced the truth of these sayings in many places I have lived. I was interested in the start of the seasons from a weather point of view, rather than from a astronomy viewpoint. The second and third parts were on meteorlogy and lightning. These parts were complete with charts and graphics, but I found the reading to be tough sledding in July. Nevertheless, I now have a healthy respect for the TV weather persons and how they come up with their forecasts."
3,"close, but no cigar","This item is as described. However, it is the minimum standard, the fabric is thin and bearly stretches over the king sized pillow. The most redeaming quality is the zipper that make sure the pillow does not slip off. In comparison to some of the other brands I have purchased on this site this pillow is average."
2,Not worth the money!,"Not worth the money do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more on a better built cabinet. It was difficult to put together and broke the first time it was opened, it's just very flimsy and poorly made. I would not recommend buying this shoe storage cabinet to anyone. Stay Away!!"
1,"This movie ...[is] so bad, I am thinking about buying it.","Me and my wife saw this movie when it was new (89). We read the cover on the back and decided to save the best till last.We struggled through the first 30 minutes, but antipated that it would get better. Another 15 minutes... Now we're struggling.I can literally say that when someone asks, ""What is the worst movie you have ever seen?"". Hands down, ""Quarantine"".However, I am thinking about purchasing it, only to have proof.One more thing. I wanted to give it no stars, until I found out that it is not possible. Therefore, I give a star to the cover."
1,This product is a fire hazard,"I purchased this charger for my husband in June 2011. He used it once and it worked fine. He used it again two months later in August, and it started smoking when plugged in! He moved it to a different outlet and again it started smoking and he could smell it burning. I'm just glad that he didn't plug it in in the basement and leave it there - it could have burned our house down.Do not put your family at risk with this product! Unfortunately I only had 1 month to return it and I didn't know that it was defective until I'd had it for 2 months, so I'm out $20."
1,B & D 12 Volt Battery Charger,"Received a B & D 12 Volt Battery Charger, 5101181-01 on May 13 2011. Noticed yesterday, June 22, 2011, that the red power light was off. Checked the output of the charger with a volt meter and it read 2.68 VDC instead of 12 VDC. I need a replacement charger. Very disappointed with this B & D item. The charger was from Buckeye Tools and the shipping was free from Amazon. If a return is required I feel I should not have to pay for shipping because it would increase the total price of the charger. If I had purchased the charger at a local store I would be able to exchange it with no additional charge."
1,Never again,Bought this charger to replace original charger that burned up after a few uses. Used this to charge 2 batteries and now this new charger is burned up also. Guess I should have read the reviews before buying. Buyer beware.
5,"Good charger, fair price",Ordered this to be shipped to another address where I was to build a deck but wasn't notified until after purchasing it that it was on backorder and subsequently I didn't have it until deck was completed and I had returned home to FL from MA.
1,Started to smoke immediatly after plugging in,I took it out plugged it in and hooked the battery to it and it began to smoke out of the charging light.Unplugged it and tossed it out!!!
1,holy crap!!!,"No joke people!, this item is a fire hazzard please do not buy!! If already did please do not leave charger unattended! Will catch on fire. Just received it today. Was phyched because I've been without a charger for awhile, plugged in and started charging. Started gettin hot (like the original carger) didn't think much of it. Then noticed the charger slowly melting above the red charge light. Then poof!! Fire! This thing is garbage!! I strongly advise not buying. Goto black n decker if anything. I'm taking it and buying a new drill unfortunatly. Its crap!!!!"
1,Junk,A piece of junk.The first one was DOA and was replaced.The replacement worked but got so hot I was afraid to use it and it may have damaged my battery.The cost of a new battery and a good charger is more than the cost of a new drill.I have bought my last piece of Black & Decker.
5,Charger I needed,It's the charger I needed.As long as I don't drop like I did with the old one it should last a long time.It charge my new battery very good and I anticipate it working for a while.If anything goes or brakes the next time maybe I'll just upgrade to lithium ion battery powered tool.
3,Hope this works....,I have gotten so much use out of this B&D 12v drill and then all of a sudden the batteries are not charging. Can only assume its the charger so I am buying another one. Can't figure why it just died for no reason though!
2,"Worked for a year and a half, then died, but I was rough with it & left it plugged in too long","I was very happy with the drill (and this charger), but after nearly a couple years the charger stopped working. I HAVE SINCE FOUND OUT A DYING/FAULTY BATTERY CAN FRY THE CHARGER, and you should never leave it charging more than 3 hours. I did not follow this rule.Granted, I kept the charger in a tool crate rattling around with big tools, and it's not the sturdiest thing. A wire connection could have been bent. I'm gonna disassemble it and see if I can fix it.So go ahead and buy it, but be aware it's kind of delicate. The rest of the drills/batteries are fine and sturdy. 2011 EDIT: I MUCH MORE RECOMMEND B&D;'S SMART CHARGER WHICH TELLS YOU WHEN THE BATTERY IS FAULTY AND DOES A COMPLETE CHARGE IN 1.5 HOURS, AND WON'T COOK THE BATTERY. SAME PRICE."
1,B&D 12 volt battery charger,Worked for about 4 weeks and then died. Would have expected better life from a product advertised as new. Review forces you to rate at least one star. This one deserves zero stars.
2,Thank God they discontinued this item,This always was a cheap piece of junk from Black & Decker. The new multi-volt charger is much better as you can leave the battery on the charger in case you forget it. It took so long to charge a battery where as the newer model will do so in one hour. This never should have been put on the market.
1,It blow out the first time I used it,"This was my second battery charger for this drill and I have had enough. When I tested my battery with my volt meter it tested okay so I started charging it about fifteen minutes later ""pop"" now the charger is dead. I bought an electric drill, and said forget it."
3,A Not-So-Well-Known-Event-In-History brought to life,"I have been searching for books on the early history of Canada, and this was one of the few I have found that is, #1, still in print, and #2, about a specific event. Most of the history of Canada books I have found are very general, and give overviews of events, instead of getting really involved in a particular period or geographic area. Although this is a bit text-bookish in parts and can move slowly, it is jam packed with information, which is what I wanted. I loved Faraghers DANIEL BOONE, and found that to be much more ""readable."""
1,10 mm thickHugger Mugger mat purchase a mistake!,I have been practicing Yoga for many years. One gal that practices with me loves this mat. Because I needed a new one I inquired and bought one. IT WAS A HUGE MISTAKE...$75!!! Doing a headstand and shoulder stand on this thick mat is like doing these on a bed mattress. My neck is now so messed up I will be lucky to be able to ever do these poses again... My chiropractor is needed weekly and I still need a new mat. Don't buy this product for an advanced Yoga practice!!!!
3,Bio-degradable...,"I had a this mat for about a year.Positive1. I do like the thickness/extra padding with it2. Biodegradable is good for the environmentNegative1. Tends to flex in wide legged poses.2. Biodegradable has its price, I leave my mat to in the car and I live in Southern California. Heat and direct sunlight WILL destroy it. I didn't realize this and now its pretty much done for.If you are careful with it I give it 4 stars but since many people will not be I have to give it 3 stars."
1,breaks down after a year,"When I first bought this mat I loved it. After a year of use the mat started to shrink in spots and buckle. It has become so bad that I had to abandon it because it would not flatten out and it became difficult to execute balancing poses. I contacted the company explaining the situation and sent a picture. They told me that the mat was designed to be biodegradable and would break down under some conditions and environments. If you expect your yoga mat to last, then look at other products."
2,not worth the money,"The rubber that this mat is made of is just too soft. I practice hot room power yoga and sure this mat is non slip, but my hands and legs sink into the mat and stretch the mat out. Makes me feel like I am practicing yoga on a piece of cotton fabric."
2,"Nice texture, bad smell","I was so excited to receive the mat. It looks really nice and has a nice texture. I like the length of it being a few inches more than the standard size. I can't wait to use it. But little did I know, it has a very strong yucky smell, in some way worse standard yoga mats. I washed it with soap and water and laid it flat in the garage to air it out. It's been three days, the smell seems to fade a little but it's still not usable. My other yoga mats took only a couple of days for the smell to fade away.Update:It's been more than a month since I received the mat. It still has that light rubbery smell. I had it out in the sun several times but I can't seem to get rid of the smell. Other than that, I do like the mat. It has a nice texture and provides good traction."
1,Don't waste your money.....,"I purchased this Hugger Mugger mat based on the reviews above....big mistake. I attend yoga classes 2-3 times a week, so I have had a chance to so through a number of mat's in 4+ years. I gave this mat about 2 months before I decided to submit a review. I don't see ANY redeeming quality about this mat...NONE. Not only is it not durable, but if you get even a slight amount of moisture on the palms of your hand, and you will slip all over this mat. Remember the 'slip and slide' mats when you were a kid?? I think this yoga mat is made of the same material. Stay away at all cost....."
2,SUPER ANTI SLIPPERY,This mat is SO anti-slippery you'll have so much trouble fitting it into the Hugger Mugger yoga mat bags.
4,Nice Cushy Mat,"As a beginner to yoga, I needed to find my own mat I could start taking to class. After much research I chose this one. When I received it I washed it in a mild soapy solution and left it unrolled for a day. The first couple times of use the mat seemed a little slippery, but this has gone away. I love the thickness of the mat. I spray it with a lavender solution after every use. It is holding up well after 30+ hours of use and hope it continues to do so. When I'm done using it, I can recycle it. Thanks Hugger Mugger."
5,Great mat,"I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loved it. She used it for all excercising not just yoga, she would just put it on the hardwood floor and it would be soft enough for her to do her thing. It is very generous in it's thickness, and very soft.To get a great eco-friendly bag, try the ""Hugger Mugger Recycled Paper Yoga Mat Bag"". It's spacious enough to fit more things than just the yoga matt, and it's very nice looking.Sadly, after she had washed it she left it in the sun too long and it got distorted. I think she got rid of it after that."
4,No more doubling up on mats,"I used to double up my mats in class or have to pause to fold over a single mat when down on a knee. For the first time I felt no pressure in my knee and I even managed a head stand. The biggest surprise was that I finally understood what my teacher meant when she said ""dig your toes in"". As an added bonus, it doesn't have that weird rubber smell that some mats have. I am sensitive to smell and this one was fine right out of the plastic. I can't give it 5 stars only because when it is rolled it barely fits under my arm which means no biking or walking to class. Maybe with straps?"
2,Skin Art,I thought this was a very poorly written movie; it could have and should have been a lot better. The acting was also poor.
5,I love this media tower!,"I bought this tower as a Christmas gift 2010. I wish I had gotten one for myself. It is solid and sturdy, it swivels smoothly, and was easy to put together. It is very larger than expected, but he has an extensive DVD collection and is almost ready for a second tower. It sits in the corner of the family room and is an attractive piece of furniture. I have no regrets in purchasing this tower and would do it again!"
5,amazing,"amazing album...worth more than it cost.my favorite songs from the album are ""A Tongue To Taste"" and ""Two For Treatment""if you like them check out Kolya...granted kolya is amazing granted only one album but a must have."
5,I was there and this book is a factual account.,I was on the deck when the attack started and in the engine room when the torpedo hit. This is a true and accurate account of the attack. Through the accounts in this book I relived a time that should never have happened. Thanks to Mr. Ennes for telling a story that needed to be told and a story that still needs a proper ending.
5,"A ""WOW"" STORY","Most interesting from start to finish. Shame on the Israelis, and more importantly the US Government for not protecting US citizens."
5,"A friend and supporter, Jim King, Brooksville, Fl","I have read my copy of the book (original printing) andam eagerly awaiting the updated version. Having known 3of the sailors killed during the unwarranted Israeliattack in 1967 and having met and become friends withmany of the survivors, LCDR Ennes' book (he was a Lt. onthe bridge at the time of the attack) tells the TRUEstory of what happened to this unarmed US Naval vessel.The fact that both the governments of Israel AND the U.S.have tried to cover up this incident and that there hasbeen no formal Congressional investigation for more than35 years is a gross miscarriage of justice for the bravemen who died as well as those who survived. Read thisbook, and you'll cryout for justice to be served. Callyour Congressman or Senator and demand these folks getjustice."
1,A stirring bit of fiction,Ennes one-man crusade against the Jewish faith has been going on for decades and has culminated in this piece of fiction. Innuendo and speculation replaces verifiable facts and sworn testimony.
1,This shoyuld be in the Fiction section,"Once again fiction is called fact! the only thing this book does is to try and inflame a hatred for Israel and Jews worldwide.The Facts are there but Ennes refuses to look at them.I'm appaled that what he calls fact is nothing more then refuted lies.Change the title to :""Lies and how they made me rich""Most of the people praising this book are the USENET whackjobs who post this thing daily in Jewish/Israeli Newsgroups and NEVER ever do they read the facts. Ennes has once again given the Tin Foil gang something to roll in while to the rest of the world it is a waste of good trees"
1,Not worth reading,"This book is full of factual errors. If you read this work of fiction you will not learn, you will just be misinformed. I recommend that you do not waste your time or money on this book."
3,Good representation,The Nobel winning physicist Richard Feynman attributed much of his success to his stubborn obsession of reading the basic papers of physics himself and not relying on other people to interpret them. I like this book because it offers the same thing - a glimpse into the world's largest religions through their own writings. I'm most familiar with Christianity and thought that the chapters covering Judaism and Christianity presented a fair representation of both religions so I'm assuming that other religions are covered in a similar fashion. The translations are very readable and there is a helpful glossary at the books' end. Good book.
3,"Good Tone, Clogs Badly","A fine tone for the price, as well as quality construction and fit. The simulated wood-grain finish is also attractive. It comes with a rugged cloth zip case, fingering chart, cleaning rod, and tiny container of recorder cream (a lubricant for fitting the recorder's three sections together). A plastic thumb rest, sold separately, is recommended to help balance the instrument while playing.The one major downside to this recorder is that the windway clogs often and easily, a virtually nonexistent problem with my Aulos plastic sopranino and Hohner wood soprano."
4,One of Chuck's best films!,"""The Hit Man"" is one of my favorite Chuck Norris movies, primarily because of the complexity of the character he portrays. On the one hand, he is a cold-blooded, heartless, murderous brute who can blow away a cohort from point-blank range without batting an eye; on the other hand, he shows a genuine caring and depth of feeling that is completely opposite from the hit man persona. The film is quite violent, and one scene showing the revenge of one mob against the other shouldn't be viewed by anyone with a weak stomach. But fans of Chuck will be kept entertained from beginning to end. And the bad guy gets his just reward in the most perfect way in the end."
3,Why did Warner issue this in Pan n' Scan ?,"This is by far my favorite Chuck Norris movie--- he's a Hitman and one mean dude.Too bad it's full-frame only, it was originally a widescreen release and as I remember, it uses the full frame.And dvdtown.com calls the video ""fuzzy"".How could Warner do this ? Somebody over there knows better because they put out a lot of great stuff, like the Noir collections.Why put out a sub-standard dvd ?"
1,very bad movie,"Too much profanity, too much bad dialog, and a poor plot all combine for one lousy movie.Chuck norris is a cop who is double crossed by his partner. He ends up being sent undercover to bust the mob who is in life and death battle with Iranian hit men. Turns out the Iranians are working for his old partner who tried to kill him at the beggining of the movie.Every other word in this movie starts with an F and ends wtih K and the action/fight scenes are very poor.I'd stay away from this movie at all costs.Rich"
5,Quite Simply...A Masterpiece,"This is the 3-D animated Christmas show that all 3-D animated Christmas shows will be compared to.This isn't just your typical light fanciful yarn, but a visceral journey into the very heart of what makes us all human.I laughed out loud,I cried(like a baby with a tooth ache)and I bit my finger nails to the quick, as this epic story of manequins,dancing rats,and gleeful fruit weaved their magic into my heart! A really good video will leave you thinking about it hours after you've seen it, with the Nutcracker I couldn't stop thinking of it for days...The haunting splendour of Uncle Drosslemeirers bedroom, or the evil coldness of the rats cheese mines have still not left my dreams. Not since the ""One Day at a Time"" Christmas special have I been so taken with a holliday show!This ranks right up there with some of the greats...The Barbara Feldon Xmas Hour, A Very Brady Christmas,The Good Times Christmas show (3rd season) and Claude Aikens Christmas Time in New Mexico."
4,nuttiest nutcracker,"my 9 year old is autistic and saw the outside cover of the dvd, thinking it was a ""zucchini birthday party."" so i had to purchase it. now she sees that it is about alot of veggies, celebrating and just loves it. thanks."
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this videobased upon the trailer on the Muppets From Space video. What a disappointment! The animation is mediocre and the plot doesn't make any sense. I do not recommend this video; there are many children's videos which are far more interesting, creative and funny. Spend your money on them."
3,YEEEEEEE-HAAAAAAA! Stop Grabbing my FACE!,"The thing is, there was NEVER any face grabbing in this whole picture! Not even on the cover! Which was confusing since my one line review explicitly says: ""Stop Grabbing my FACE! you morons."" The 'you morons' i had to add for effect. I couldn't include it in the one liner because the effect was lost. and anyway, there was very little effect, but i wouldn't say that. Hey, the cowboy with hat and the black lady, they came over from NO WHERE! I don't know much about computers, but ladies is sweeeeee-eat! If you have to see one movie this year, watch for the black lady's scene! and the cowboy ROCKED! btw; there's a lot of face grabbing, so i can't recommend the scene with black lady AT ALL!hey... why not? eh? sure."
2,"Why the religious references, this isn't Veggie Tales","I loved the humor, and the Rat, err, Mouse King's antics, but what I couldn't stand was the religous stuff. It's not advertised on the front, and it's not mentioned in any of the reviews i read on this, or even in the preview trailer. It kind of bugs me to have this great christmas classic tarnished everytime Peabo Bryson decides to sing us a song. In every scene that accompanied his songs, it seemed like Marie and the gang were in church. I actually had to watch it again to make sure i wasn't imaging them. Now if I wanted VeggieTales, I'd buy it. Other than that, it's a goofy movie that keeps my kids plenty entertained."
3,This movie is for kids,"I'd just like to say that while I didn't think this movie rated very high, my daughter, who saw it the first time when she was 7 1/2 is crazy about this movie and since that who I bought it for, I am happy she likes it!"
2,Maybe if it was 22min but painful at 48min...,"Younger children may enojy nuts talking and mice fighting the soldiers but all of this comes in way too long at 48min. I initially thought the Amazon Editorial Review by Doug Thomas was alittle harse but after watching this, it was kind. It may have had some chance at 22min (think of your favorite Christmas Special - most are for a 30min time slot - with the Rudolph classic set for 1hr). I knew Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and this is no Rudolph!"
4,ONE OF THE BEST HIP-HOP SONGS OF'99!,"THIS IS FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN Q-TIP GROW SINCE THE LATE 80'S. YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE FEW WAYS TIP CAN MAKE YOU SHAKE SOMETHING AS WELL AS HAVING YOU HIT THE REPEAT BUTTON ON YOUR SYSTEM. YES IT IS SAD THAT TRIBE AIN'T TOGETHER ANYMORE. BUT, LISTEN TO THE WAY Q-TIP KEPT HIS OWN STYLE. THIS SONG WILL KEEP YOUR HEAD BOPPIN' JUST LIKE IN THE VIDEO WHERE TIP'S HEAD IS BOPPIN'. DON'T START HATIN' JUST CAUSE HE FOUND HIS NICHE AND USED IT MAKE ENDS. THIS SONG IS THE BEGINING OF A NEW EMERGENCE FROM TIP'S BOY TO MAN GROWTH. THE SONG IS WELL PUT TOGTHER AS WELL AS HAVING THAT LITTLE EXTRA UMMPH THAT MAKES IT Q-TIPS. SO ONCE AGAIN EXCELLENT SONG."
2,q tip at his worst,"this is the epitome of falling off - the lyrics are wack (pretty girl, real good girl ... my itty bitty world) - the beat is silly - i dont know what happend to tip - he's been my hero since way back, but the old tip woiuld have agreed - this song is just plain sad"
2,"Hmmm....Nope, Not Feeling It","""Vivrant Thing"" was a big disappointment for me. I love A Tribe Called Quest and hearing Tip resort to this just tore me apart. Tip's lyrics are way too simplistic and trite and the beat is somewhat catchy, but annoying. I got Amplified and turned this up loud to see if I'd get up and dance, but no. It didn't do anything for me. Maybe if he came with better lyrics and added something to the beat, ""Vivrant Thing would have been fine. I hope Tip will come with better material in the future."
1,A FABLE by William Faulkner,"I read where Faulkner is sometimes referred to as the American Shakespeare. After reading A Fable, that is true if you want to use Shakespeare's ""Much Ado about Nothing"" to describe Faulkner's Pultizer Prize winning book. Who really needs a 600 + sentence while his stream of consciousness writing results in the reader becoming unconscious. The last 100 pages of the book wasn't bad, but it is hard to believe that it won the Pultizer. Earl Holden"
2,Did Faulkner care?,"I had to read and re-read numerous sections of this book hoping to understand what Faulkner was getting at with this story and sadly, I never did get it. I knew that this was going to be a difficult book but not to the point that it discourages a person to never want to pick up another book. Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me. Read at your own risk of being completely disappointed with Faulkner's A Fable."
2,"A Turgid, Pretentious Anti-War Allegory","No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."
2,This is not an anti-war novel...,"... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics."
1,"Faulkner 1, Reader 0","I generally like and admire Faulkner's work, but this novel (or whatever it is) got the better of me. Usually I make myself finish any book I read no matter how difficult, but with ""A Fable"" I simply couldn't do it (and I've managed the entirety of James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" and Proust's ""Remembrance of Things Past"".) I may have a Master's Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say. It's amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get through this thing, much less give it an award. I haven't given up on Faulkner, but for the first time since I was a college undergraduate, I've given up on a book. It took ""A Fable"" to bring me to my knees."
3,An Extreme Dose of Faulkner,"A Fable is Faulkner's thinly disguised allegory of Christ's story in the guise of a mutiny on the Western Front in World War One. In this sense the novel mirrors some of Faulkner's short stories about the Great War. His writing about that conflict had a great deal of grounded verisimilitude. But A Fable contains much of extraneous matter, is a difficult and dense read, and comes in very long 437 pages. This is Faulkner doing all of his tricks. The long, long sentence, the page long paragraph, the dense and tedious plot all but submerged in an ocean of language. Faulkner's work is never for everyone. For A Fable this may be doubly true."
1,Very Hard Book!,"I have to help my 5th. Grade daughter to understand this book, can anybody help me first! If you have read and have a summary could you share! Thanks"
2,Possible solution for dropped connections,"I had both the whole unit stop working and the strange wireless connection freezes. I have this gateway and the solution to the dropped connections and lock ups was to put a very small fan blowing on the router. It's possible that it's an overheating problem, even when the room is relatively cool. I read about the possible overheating problem somewhere, and my connection has been completely solid 24/7 for several months since I put the fan on it. Before that, it was dropping the connection daily and required pulling the power plug to reset the connection.This product was given to me by Comcast when I ordered the Home Networking option.The connection IS much better now with this modem than it was before with my own store-bought cable modem, but that is not saying much.In summary: This unit sucks, don't buy it - and I like Netgear products.If this review helps you with your problem, please bump it (click on 'Yes' it was helpful)"
2,Long term failure,"I've had this product for a little over a year now, and I'm about to toss it and move a to a Linksys.Over the life of the unit it has had occasional Internet drop outs that would require the unit to be powered off and on to recover. This happened infrequent enough to be a small nuisance that didn't rise to the level of replacement.Unfortunately recently the wireless of router has been dropping and then last week completely failed. Of course being out of warrantee, no support is offered.My guess as to the failure is that the unit simply runs too hot. Not enough engineering and too much in too little of a package. You could use it as coffee warmer.The reviews on the Linksys WCG200 look good and I'm braving the Comcast tech support tonight."
2,Netgear CG814M and Comacst,"My 3 star rating is based on my rating of this unit's features and Netgear support - I still do not have it working yet.(I have made 6 calls to Comcast support, but the connection from the modem is still being refused by Comcast.)I called Netgear support to see if they could shed any light, and after waiting 45 minutes, was answered by a call center in India by a technician that I could not understand. An e-mail supprt request remains unanswered after 2 days."
2,Repeatedly Drops Connection,"I have the same problem as several other reviewers. The box repeatedly drops the wireless connection and has to be rebooted. I'm actually on my third one, the first two having been replaced by Netgear after the same problem. Reviewers who love it tend to be those who just set it up. Setup was easy and the unit worked beautifully in the beginning but as another reviewer said, it seems to run too hot and just wears itself out. The drops initially only happened every few days, now a few times a day and any time I attempt to move a large amount of data. Alas, will have to replace the unit again."
3,BECOMING SELF-ACTUALIZING,"Abraham MaslowThe Farther Reaches of Human Nature(New York: Viking, 1971 and later reprints) 407 pages(ISBN: 0140194703)(Library of Congress call number: BF637.S4M368 1993)A posthumous collection of some of Maslow's writings,containing many essays about self-actualization.If you are in search of deeper being,search the Internet for: ""Authenticity Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher"
3,Okay...but disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with this burp cloth. They are smaller than I expected (a little bigger than a wash cloth), and while I have washed them, the fabric itself is not soft. They are not ""bad"" by any means. I plan to use them and hope they will be absorbent and adequate. However, I would not recommend them as a favorite baby product, or purchase them to give as a gift."
1,Fell apart after one washing,I never even got to use these. I washed them once time while I was getting things ready for the baby. One of the washcloths completely fell apart. I plan to contact the manufacturer and Amazon.
1,Got small bibs instead of burp cloths,"I ordered these burp cloths, but instead got 2 very small bibs (the ones that just go around the baby's neck)."
1,...organic?,"I was not pleased with this product. First of all, they're made in China. Can something made where 90% of the ground water is contaminated with pollution really be considered organic? Secondly, after only one washing -- before even being used -- the quality was seriously degraded. They are cheaper than other organic burp cloths, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Acceptable,"These are pretty nice burp cloths, certainly better than cloth diapers. The color of them is different than what shows...they are really more of an organic, unbleached coffee and cream color. The satin ribbon is cute, seems durable. My only con is I wish they were larger, when you drape them over your shoulder there isn't much coverage and I am afraid the baby will ""miss"" the cloth. But you can say this about ANY burp cloth...which is why i will buy a bunch of cheap receiving blankets too."
2,Over priced wash cloth,"These are not nearly as soft and absorbent as I had hoped. Also, there are many loose threads and the quality is not at all what I expected. I say save your money for another product. My favorite burp clothes are the Babies R Us brand."
5,Bring health messages down to earth,"I wish I could tell everybody who has ever produced any kind of health information material to read this book. The advice it gives has helped me write more clearly period - not just for people with low literacy. Given the overwhelming amount of about health care information in the news and on the Web, health communicators need to make their messages accessible and meaningful or get lost in the shuffle. This book shows you how."
4,Selected in Brandon & Hill bibiliography for nursing.,"Selected in Brandon & Hill nursing bibliography (Nursing Outlook, March-April, 1996)for nursing collections."
3,Fitting for American Girl Dolls,"Everything fits our American Girl dolls except the pants...way too tight in the waist! Also, the way this is packaged in the box puts holes in everything...the shirt is nylon and since it has holes, it has runs now. :-("
3,"Good Overview, Little ""New""","John Lewis Gaddis has done the general reader a service by writing a relatively short book about the entire Cold War period. Serious students and scholars will probably find themselves saying ""I am familiar with these events and Gaddis's take on them, so why did I buy the book?"" That is a fair question, but the book does encapsulate the key points of Gaddis's interpretations of major issues, so if one is seeking such an overview of the 1946-1991 era with a conservative tilt, one could certainly do worse than The Cold War: A New History."
2,Not what I expected,"This is a well written book that unfortunately is not the book I hoped it would be. If, like me, you are looking for a book that retells the history and events of the cold war then you will be disappointed. If you already possess a knowledge or vivid memory of those events and are looking for an opinion on the thoughts of individuals and the ideology that led to those events then you will be delighted. For example, I would expect a book on the Cold War to spend 10+ pages on the Berlin airlift. There was one sentence that mentioned it occurred. Checkpoint Charlie and the stories associated with it - not mentioned. Gary Powers and the U2 plane - one paragraph. Etc. Etc. Again, this is a well written book and the author didn't fail to deliver so much as I failed to buy the right book. I offer this review so that others looking for the same book I was aren't disappointed."
3,A Very Average Introduction to the Topic,"This book is written for laymen, not specialists, as explicitly state in the book's preface. Hence the question to ask, does it succeed in this regard? The answer is in a very average way. By this, this reviewer means that this book is, pretty much, not distinguishable from the large number of books written on the same subject. No new insights, analyses or facts are offered that can break this book out from its myriad competition. Hence the average rating. If a reader is interested in such an average overview of the Cold War the book will perform as expected. It covers all the basics but with the problems cited above. In other words it is a useful introductory primer to the subject but nothing else."
5,A must read for Cold War fans,"Anyone interested in the Cold War should definitely get this book from their local library. Clearly aimed at a broad audience, it offers a brilliant account of how ideology and pragmatism affected the decision makers of power brokers and statesmen on both sides of the divide. It also changed my perspective on world geopolitics from a more disengaged and naive view to a more realistic one. A must read for Cold War fans!"
3,Formatting glitch,"This is a facsimile edition, not a used copy, which is OK, but there has been a printing error so that when the book is open, the odd numbered pages are on the left and the even numbered pages are on the right, and the page numbers are found near the bound edges instead of at the outside edges. Otherwise, the content appears to be complete and legible."
2,At least they got back together...,"Jon Hiseman writes in the booklet: ""If you are looking for <<Son of Valentyne Suite>> you can forget it... those days are long gone, for us, as well as you..."" No kidding! If you loved the rock-jazz of the 70s Colosseum with those trademark fugues you will hate this CD. The sound reminds me of a watered down, boring mix of Blood Sweat and Tears, Steely Dan, and Chicago. Heckstall-Smith is vaguely decent only on a couple of tracks. Don't waste your money on this CD--buy the old ones. The rating is *two* stars instead of one (or zero) as an encouragement to stay together and rediscover their rock-jazz plus classical roots."
3,Grady Throws Down-'80s Style!,"I have never heard of Grady Harrell before. He never received any radio or video play here in Toronto, Canada. It wasn't until I saw the video of ""Fun"" online, that I was exposed to his music. One thing, the version of ""Fun"" that is available on this CD is different sounding. It has a homogenized sound to it compared to the version used on his video. I am assuming that the video version is the edited 12""single mix. The other songs on this album are not too bad. It's late '80s R&B/Dance, so it has a little of that Milli Vanilli vibe to it. It is still a fun album to listen to if you like late '80s dance music. Grady was also a ""Soul Train"" dancer, and only made 2 albums, this one in 1989, and his 2nd in 1990."
5,Essential for serious Rypdal's collection,"An interesting and refreshing album by this amazingmusician. You will not find here the power of ""Blue"" or""Chaser"" (two of my favourites CD's) but it helps as aslowdown-break between them. And it works."
2,Crashes before it sails,"2 1/2Atmosphere defeats substance in middling late seventies fusion, which at best evokes a mild Miles."
1,Not So Great...,"I purchased this video in a bookstore on Cape Cod last summer and was disapointed. Though I admit no video or photograph can match the beauty of the Cape that I know, this video is both dated and technically rough around the edges. The content was a little superficial as well.Sorry, if this sounds superficial, but hopefully they'll update it."
4,Touching tale of committment and love.,A young boy opts to adopt an abused and neglected dog in need of a home rather than raise a coveted purebreed pup and learns that hard-earned love is sometimes the sweetest to receive. Ukrainian artist Katya Krenina's illustrations are delightful and Lisa McCourt's tale of a boy and his dog seemed particularly relevant to our family's own adoption story.
4,all about the moon,"Each two page spread has a picture, the moon's name (Native American), a short poem and a short fact about the moon. At the end of the 12 months, there is a Q and A section about blue moons and why the moon changes shapes. A very kid friendly book about the different times of year."
5,Perfect replacement,"I had looked at these exact replacement pieces at the baby store near me, but these were cheaper. They fit my Medela Pump in style advanced perfectly."
3,"Love the pump, not the pieces","I love the pump that I have overall, and these are a required part of it. They work well, however they are terribly hard to wash. Also, for what you get they are rather expensive."
1,crappy valves,For some reason these valves are too big for my pump. It is the right model and everything. Totally bummed.
5,Speedy delivery,I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As promised I received my order in a matter of 3 days. Baby is due in 4 weeks and these will surely be put to good use when I start using my Medela breast pump.
5,Excellent,"I was sure buying Medela to have high quality and this was not an exception. Medela is one of the most present brand on the market, it's a little expensive, but definitely the best one."
5,As expected,the membranes are very thin and after numerous use can be ripped. I like these membranes as it saves time and does not interrupt a process
3,Simplistic Jerry Springer-like psychobabble.,"I was disappointed with this book. One would expect great prose from a National Book Award winner, yet Bloom's stories all sound vaguely the same. Her character's lack personality, the reader is left alone in this book with nothing but the character's actions for companionship. The dialogue sounds forced and I had a hard time believing that real people actually say the things that Ms. Bloom has them saying.After reading a little bit at night, I would find myself forgetting in the morning whether the story was something I read or something I watched on cheap tabloid TV."
1,no accolades here,"I threw this book in the trash, I was so very disappointed. Characters are flat, story lines are absurd........why would I be interested in a stepmother sleeping with her stepson after the funeral of her husband? All of you who seem to love this author, switch to Elizabeth Berg.....superior author and stories with depth."
1,Disappointing,"This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time. The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable. The book has a section called ""Three Stories"", describing different times in the lives of the same characters. The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn't realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story. Since I couldn't identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story."
4,An unflinchingly honest look at relationships,"I came to know Amy Bloom in my early twenties as a subscriber to Glamour Magazine. Her column was always witty. Always insightful. Imagine my delight, when I heard her interviewed on NPR. Listening to her talk about Come to Me had me severly intrigued and I purchased it that afternoon. What a fascinating look at relationship dynamics -- I read it in a few hours. Her stories offer no apologies, only unflinching honesty. You often feel like you have happened upon people you shouldn't be overhearing as they work through their grief, anomisity, anger and fear. If you can read it with the open-mindedness Ms. Bloom intended, you will have read one of the best short story collections out there."
3,A Collection that Eventually Comes Around,"I bought this book because it's always interesting to see what type of literary fiction psychoanalysts come up with. I wasn't too impressed with the first half of the collection. I found the characters rather dull and flat and the dialog a bit forced (""Love is Not a Pie"" is the exception). For example, ""Song of Solomon"" is awful -- don't bother reading it. However, ""Silver Water"" in the Three Stories section is beautifully written, very realistic, and hits you exactly where a story of this nature should. As the collection progresses, the writing and weaving of Amy Bloom's stories get better. Skip the first section and this book is a delight."
3,Good historical reference book,"This book is a series of training tools based on German Generals being interviewed after WWII. If you want to know what the General Staff thought about the Eastern Front, go for it. If not, pass this one up."
2,Too colorless and artless for me,"This is strictly a batch of poorly written first-hand reports without appropriate annotation. There are interesting anecdotes about the fierce cold and the toll it took, but this simply wasn't a well-done book. Disappointing"
1,Don't waste your time!,"I consider myself to be a ""serious"" history buff, and this book is not history! It's a boring rehash from behind the front German generals. What ordeals did they suffer compared to the troops on the line? This book was boring, stilted, and told me nothing I hadn't read elsewhere."
2,Interesting for only the most hard-core WWII historian,"An interesting premise for a WWII history book - this is a compilation of the writings of various German soldiers in Allied captivity who wrote about thier experiences on the Russian front - unfortunately most, if not all, of the personal experiences and anecdotes have been left out. It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc. very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview. If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it. If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this."
2,Neither Savage or Sensuous,I must admit that the title caught my attention. Sad to say the music won't. It reminded me of being in a department store elevator stuck in the mezzanine and unable to get out. You can save yourself. If you want good exotica buy a Les Baxter CD.
4,Positive message for preschoolers,Message of this game is very positive. Kids help to correct mini-emergencies. The cars are fun for the kids and the art work is top notch.
3,Two Enjoyable Episodes!,"While not outstanding episodes, both these stories are very entertaining. I'm not sure, but believe at least some of the shots in the first were taken on board the Queen Mary which is permanently docked in Long Beach, CA. It's always good to see Leslie Nielsen and I kept waiting for him to do something funny but the role was strictly serious. Instead, Jo Anne Worley (Laugh-In) and Vicki Lawrence (Carol Burnett Show) were the silly ones. The second story teamed Jessica once again with Harry McGraw played by the wonderful Jerry Orbach."
4,"Pretty nice album, incredible production","At this point, Kamelot has riched a level in quality of compositión that only could go up. The songs are pretty nice, and once again the balad ones are amazing, but this time I belive the best song it's ""forever"" a very melodic power song.But the most interesting thing of the album is the high level of production that translates in a great sound and very interesting arrengments and ideas, thanks to the cooperation of Milo and Sasha Paeth (also Luca Turilli and Rhapsody producers).Kamelot is since Siege Perilous - 1998 a very good metal band that has rich a very identificable sound and a standar level that would please any metal fan that likes certain level of technique and performance, but in this album (2001)the band still shows a grade of evolution making us think that the next will be also better than the previous ones. Highly recomended album."
3,Not bad,"Kamelot has only improved with each record, and i can say that this is their best. Overall, it's well conceived and fairly complicated (folks, the guitarist does not make the band). The only song that I can say was nearly perfect (for me at least) was the title track ""Karma"". In general, the other tracks lack a certain ""catchy-ness"" that is indeed important in all music. Lyrics are the only real cliqued and bland part of this band. ""Power"" metal bands need to do something a little more diverse and creative with their lyrics. Which brings the point, that you can't help feeling you've heard this before...and the truth..you probably have. Kamelot may have improved with this album, but it's nowhere near what I know they can do."
3,Kamelot,"Not bad, but definitely not one of my favorites by them. Still, no regrets purchasing it -it's a good listen."
5,WOW,"Amazing album, amazing band. One of the best American metal bands that most people don't know!!!"
5,FULLSCREEN? Really?,"A lot of people have been waiting a long time to see this movie on DVD. This is Anthony Quinn doing a great Aristotle Onassis. But wait a minute...FULLSCREEN? Really? I mean, who still watches a square TV? What is this...1998?Even my elderly, tech-challenged in-laws have a widescreen TV and Bluray.This film was always known for its gorgeous scenery - it therefore deserves only a quality transfer in widescreen, not to mention Bluray.I can't think of a quicker way to send a new release straight to the nation's bargain bins. Hey Universal, you might want to do the right thing here. Otherwise, why bother?"
4,A love story shared with the world,"Predictable story line based loosely on the Jackie O - Onasis affair. Filmed was lots of panache & usual flare of the life style they experienced. Anthony Quinn, of course, was in his comfort zone of Greek heritage & carried the roll to perfection. Bisset fitted in without being over dominate. Worth a look just to remind us of the time & the event."
2,Greek,"This was not a very good movie, nor well acted. Anthony Quinn always play good movies but this one was just o.k."
4,"Great book, great information, great photographer!","I think that Ansel Adams was a great photographer, I personally love photography, and would love to see more professional photographers."
3,Terrific overview of a camera,"This book is a wonderful introduction to photography, without getting too technical. I was written over 40 years ago, but photography basics don't change just because the photographic media did.I strongly recommend the book for anyone just starting out in photography, who wants to understand all the varriables that the camera offers."
4,Precious,"Book is a little outdated but hey, it's precious nonetheless. I collect photography books so it's right up my alley."
3,Still some problems with the product,"Basically it has the same functionality as the desktop product, but there are several limitations when the software was scaled down for the PDA. It doesn't work with e-mail programs and it is not possible to take some data to the clipboard without entering into the edit mode. You can not dial a number from a Tungsten T linked to a bluetooth enabled telephone. It seems that Interact were in a hurry to start selling a product for the Palm platform. I hope they release new versions of this product in the near future."
3,For the classes I taught---it missed too much of the point,"I was hoping to see a lot more about meta-narrative and how important is in our interpretation. ""Meaning"" should not derived in the details, but starting from big picture narratives that run throughout the Bible. There was very little in the book regarding literary interpretation, and that is arguably more important than historical-critical. Also there wasn't any mention of Speech-Act Theory. No explanation of Implied Audience or Implied Author, Implied vs Empirical, etc.Its a decent book but was too focused on the minor details and not enough on ""Whats the story?""edit--- I revisited my review, and while I agree with my thesis above, three stars is probably a more accurate reflection of my thoughts (rather than the previous rating of two stars)."
5,Awesome Book,This book was great for beginners in reading the bible. A lot of people are afraid to study or read the bible because they don't know how to. This book made my studying and reading the bible so much more meaningful and achievable. I would recommend over other books any day.
2,Too much work!,"I am so disappointed in this book, what a waste of money. This is a direct quote from the book: ""Make observations, Dig deep! Think hard. This is not an easy passage. Spend time on this. Make dozens and dozens of observations. Read and read! Looik again! Observe! Observe! Observe!"" This quote is repeated in the first assignments. I am an avid reader of all kinds of books and I am old enough to know that hard work is necessary in many aspects of our lives, but surely this is not one of them. The bible is too complex even for educated theologians. I don't want to work that hard. The book is supposed to be ""hands on"". Maybe it gets better later in the book, but frankly, this author's writing style is not engaging at all, and I find it so laborious to read it, to the point where I just can't make myself read any further."
2,College book,Thank you for sending the book fast so that I could start reading it for my college class
4,nice and comfy,"warm, seem to run a little large. I'm normally an 8.5, I ordered an 8 and it is a little roomy."
2,"Slippers ok, but way too small","These slippers seem okay, but they run way small. I wear an 8.5/9 very consistently, but the size 9 of these slippers is about two sizes small for me. They might be decent slippers, but the inconvenience of having to return them outweighs their merits for me."
4,It is what it is...,"No problems...as described, but runs small. I ordered them for someone who wears a 6 1/2, and the size 9 fits nicely."
3,"Well, they are warm...","I am not as happy with these as I could be- there's very little padding in the sole, so they just don't cushion your feet very well. They are warm and otherwise comfy, but if you wear slippers for the ""squishy factor"", I wouldn't get these. Also, the rubber sole is quite narrow, so if you wear them out to get the mail or whatever, the sheepskin along the sides will get dirty and/or wet. As for size, they were true to size for me- sounds like that isn't very consistant, reading the reviews from other folks."
2,Sizing is inconsistent within this brand,"I have 2 pairs of Tamarac slippers already, and when they went on sale, I decided to buy a couple of pairs for next year. I bought a size 9 previously in a different style and they fit perfectly. These are beautiful slippers, very well made, but when my second pair arrived, they were too tight and I have to send them back. Very unfortunate because I love the feel of these. I hope this manufacturer will correct these sizing inconsistencies so I can buy with confidence in the future."
5,"WONDERFUL, I LOVE THEM","I WAS AFFRAID TO ORDER THEM BECAUSE THE LAST PAIR I BOUGHT A FEW MONTHS AGO WERE AWFUL AND ALREADY WORN OUT. I PAID $54.00 FOR THEM THROUGH AMAZON. WHEN I SAW A PICTURE OF THESE SLIPPERS FOR UNDER $15, I HESITATED TO BUY THEM. BOY, AM I GLAD I DID BUY THEM, I LOVE THEM.JOANNE H. STEWART"
2,You get what you pay for,"$15.00 was best price ever for sheepskin slippers, but the inside seams stuck up all the way around, so not at all comfortable. Had to return. Got the Cabela's booties instead, lots more $ but much better quality."
1,do not order these,"I received mine yesterday and returned them today. The uppers are glued to the sole in a haphazard fashion. Once you put them on, you can feel the edges where the uppers are glued and clipped on the inside. I doubt they would last long. Glue is not the way to go. They should be stitched. Shoddy workmanship all the way around. I am sorry I paid for the shipping to get them. and the shipping to send them back. All in all, $16 to find out they were shoddy. Never again!"
2,Not so comfy,"I bought these for my mom as a gift thinking, ""hey, they're cheap, isn't all shearling good?"" Not so much. The insides of these slippers felt similar to burlap. They were very sturdy! Not so comfy.They also ran about a size smaller than I ordered. I'm a size 7, and the 8's were a little small for my feet."
5,"great quality for the price, perfect for keeping toes warm!","these are my first pair of sheepskin booties, and they definitely won't be my last. i work from home, and my heating bill was way too high the past couple of months. my feet get cold easily, and these booties keep me warm and toasty (despite the fact that i've lowered the thermostat to 69 to save on heating costs). i usually wear a 5.5, and the size 6 booties are perfect with socks on. i prefer these to slip-on scuffs because they stay on even when you put your feet up on a stool."
4,SUPER COMFY....runs small.,"I'm a size 9 1/2. I bought a size 10. They didn't fit. Perfect in width, but definitely not long enough. My mom's got a slightly smaller foot than I do, so I gave them to her. She absolutely loves them.You'll love em too...if you order one size larger than you usually would!"
4,Slipper Review,"This product is exactly what it says it is. The shearling is not as soft as others, but they are very warm. I think I would prefer a more rounded toe, as this one is more pointed. There is no arch support but you don't find that with many slippers anyway. I like the bootie versus a scuff because it stays on my feet when I go up and down stairs. It also keeps more of my feet warm. This isn't a luxury slipper, but it does it's job. You can't ask more than that for the price."
2,had to return this item,"There was nothing wrong with these slippers other than they did not fit properly. Information had been provided that these slippers run small, and advice was given to order up a half size. I normally wear a 7 1/2, so i ordered the 8's. I could not keep them on my feet. They were very wide and too long. The quality was OK but they were such a poor fit, even with socks, that i just returned them."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $15, so I probably shouldn't complain, BUT... First, the size is quite small. I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11, based apon others reviews. The 11 BARELY fits, and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes, the slippers do look nice, but unlike other similar slippers I've owned (and paid a lot more for) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes. I'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor, but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom. I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot, and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful. If the slippers were bigger, maybe I wouldn't feel it, but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles, which did help a bit. All in all, I'm pretty dissapointed."
5,great,"Because I have a small foot I really have trouble finding anything that truely fits...... These do....,.. They are warm,comfortable and a pleasure to wear... I LOVE THEMM............"
2,"Good quality, soft sole","I recently broke my foot, and got these slippers for recovery. Although they are good quality, the sole is soft and thin. A great buy if that's what you're looking for. Unfortunately, didn't work for me."
3,Just a bit snug!,"I really enjoy these slippers, although they are cut a bit small. These slippers did work, but are a bit hard to put on. I always wear a size 9, and I feel these slippers would have been a bit more comfortable in a size bigger. Give it some thought, these are only slippers, and much more comfortable in a bigger size. Order the next size up, you will thank me later!"
4,Warm but less than perfect,"Shearling is the best slipper material I have ever tried, so I've owned a number of shearling slippers. The sole of these is not as cushy as others I've had, and they don't feel quite as snug (which makes slippers snuggly). Having a non-shearling outer sole, as these do, is key for any sort of durability. Not a bad buy at the price, but there's a little compromise."
2,sizing + rough + made in china = meh.,"Odd sizing: I ordered a size too large based on other reviews, and they fell off my feet. I returned them for my usual size, and my toes bump the tips. Well, they're leather, they should slop out with wear. The sole is also disproportionately narrow.Rough shearling: nothing really horrible, but enough to be irritating over a long evening's wear.""Representing the finest in America's Slipper Tradition"" (That's what it says right on the box): my eye, they're made in China!Bottom line: my feet are warm, but these aren't worth the cost, especially when environmental factors are included. When they wear out, I'll be looking for local + quality to replace."
5,All time favourite slippers,"I live in either these slippers or sandal type Birkenstocks. These slippers have been a great consolation to me over the years. Pathetic, eh? :) Anyway, they hug the foot and, as another reviewer already stated, come in handy for when one has to venture outside ever so briefly."
4,This is a good buy.,"I have a Bosch router in a Bosch router table and have lived with the under-table adjusting for several years. It was not a 'big' problem, but I would have preferred a through-table adjustment. I'm cheap so I wasn't going to buy a lifter. When I saw this and got a bargain on a used one, I jumped on it. I got the base and installed it in a few minutes. I drilled an access hole in the plate for the key and instantly loved the ease of fine adjustment without reaching under the table. In a few weeks, I experienced the same problem as another reviewer and the locking washer gave out. However, because Amazon is willing to publish good AND bad reviews, I was able to read a quick and easy solution with a stop collar. I bought the stop collar and had it working perfectly again in a few minutes. Bosch should fix this problem, but thanks to reviews, I had a work-around. The base is worth the money...just have a 1/4"" stop collar available."
3,Review of Bosch RA1165,"This is a good quality router base with easy bit height adjustment once installed and operating. However, I found it difficult to accurately mark and drill the mounting plate holes. Bosch should have included a drawing or template of the hole pattern so that the mounting holes can be marked and drilled precisely."
4,Bosch router table base,"The base is as advertised and works well in a table. However, the access opening for the key is close to the fence and required the purchase of an extended (4.5 + inch) hex wrench to change heights when used with the Rockler fence."
4,Convenient,"I installed this on my new router table. It is very convenient for moving my Bosch router motor from the table to the plunge router base and fixed base. The above table adjustment for the most part is non-functional as the fence is typically postioned above the set screw. However, my router table is not a cabinet style and is open on all four sides so the micro adjsutment on the base itself is easy to reach and read. This would be a difficut set up to use if my router table were a cabinet style."
4,Fixed more than Our Table Issues (no doubt!),"We brought this baby home, expecting the most. Boy, did we get it. It was one of those nights: Clarance and Arnold are ""on their way"", six others were expected. I had an amazing recipe from Marie Curie (Spanish salad!) and Ken had squeezed the juice clean from the cranberry. We threw the table together, and after some simple instructions (and not less than two stubbed thumbs) we were in ""biz""! I would decide to tell anyone that this tool really has something for everyone. Pleased customer."
5,Absolutely necessary,"Not much to say except that the product does exactly what it is supposed to do; the real value is in what it saves you from doing. Having to attach and detach my router's fixed base to the router table each time I wanted to use it was enough of a pain that I sometimes decided against doing certain projects. Now that I have the Bosch RA1165 permanently attached under my wonderful Bosch RA1181 router table, I jump easily and immediately between fixed base and router table use. The Bosch RA1165 looks to me to be exactly the same as the fixed base for the Bosch 1617EVSPK router, without the wooden handles (though there are holes to attach handles), so it works precisely the same as the base I was used to.If you ever use your router off the table, this product is absolutely necessary. Very much worth the low price."
2,the paper is of very low quality,"My daughter is very disappointed with this coloring book.The paper is very dark, ruff and thin. It absorbs the ink so fast, that it is almost impossible to color using markers, you can only use crayons.The price is high and the quality is low - not a good product.The Pictures are nice, though."
4,Great condition!!,I really appreciated the fantastic quality of the used book at the relatively cheap price. I am especially grateful for the speedy delivery!! Thanks so much for being honest and efficient.
2,decent products - awful technical support,"I've had a variety of netgear products over the last 3-4 years. I've generally been pleased w/features and functionality.Up until recently I've never had to draw on netgear tech support. However, after a year of working fine one of my firewall/routers went ""kerplunk."" All the signs point to a hardware problem. So I contacted tech support realizing that I'd have to go through the usual rigamorole (sp?) to get an RMA.However, despite a very detailed email description of the problems and the various things I did to try and fix them (firmware upgrades/reinstalls, hardware resets, etc) the tech who answered me told me I'd have to contact them through telephone support.Currently (11:10 PM Eastern Time, 29 July 2003) wait times for tech support are in excess of 140 minutes! That's unacceptable.If you are lucky enough to never need tech support, or to have an item repaired/replaced then netgear is a fine option. Otherwise, buyer beware!"
2,Biased,"This book, while well-written, is fatally marred by the author's biases and selective view of the evidence. If you read the entire retrial testimony rather than merely the few portions which are mentioned by the author, it quickly becomes clear that Sackville-West's ""take"" on Joan is largely false. I would recommend Regine Pernoud's books instead, many of which are sold on this site."
3,Just Ok,The only thing I didn't like out of these cutters is there are a few that are way too big or way too small for a cookie. The others are just the right size and work well with sugar cookie dough.
5,Perfect timing,"Lynne's book arrived at the perfect time! As hospitals deal with nursing shortages as well as other shortages of healthcare workers in the U.S., managers need to make the most of the staff we have. We owe it to our patients and the physicians we serve to be the best we can be each day. The attempt to stretch ourselves to cover all the requirements of safe patient care with overwhelming budget cuts have led to short fuses and easy frustrations on a daily basis in acute healthcare.The Power of a Good Fight brings hope and ease to managers in what often seems to be an unmanageable work world, by simply and powerfully taking us step by step through all the What-ifs we face. Ahhh...It feels like having a coach at my side. I liked the book and plan to pass it around!"
2,bad dubbing?,"The sound quality was AWFUL... if there was any way to return to get a better sound I would, but the content was awesome. It sounds like a bad tape-recording dubbed a million times to the point the voices are low and fuzzy. Oh-well. If you love Therese, like we do, you can bear with it and ""offer it up."""
1,Ruined,"I wished a was able to find a copy of S.A. before I got a subscription. The S.A. that I knew this is not. The best features of this magazine have been stripped away. I can't wait for my subscription to end, and I just received my first copy. There are much better hunting magazines out there, wish I had the time to list them."
2,Tabla Book,I was not happy with product and returned the book. My edition was poorly printed and pages were out of order.It covered the basics and then quickly became very complicated. Music books can help a student but best used if one has an instructor.The intricacies of playing the tabla cannot be understood just with a book. I would suggest a book with a CD or DVD.David Courtney's other basic book is much better for the beginner.
1,Only buy this if you enjoy being cut,"Yes, I did not know you could cut yourself with an electric razor....yes, it did happen and you have been warned."
1,Waste of Time.,"Viewed: 7/11Rate: 27/11: Zzzzz...watching The Addams Family is like pouring nitric acid on my brain. I hate all of the characters, and it gets ever annoying to watch Gomez to be fancy and exciting doing things. It's like...Can the nightmare end? Even though it is a 101 minute flick, The Addams Family is just too long to sit through. The plot is idiotic, and the whole time, I am wondering why couldn't they have electrocuted Fester in hopes of kicking his amnesia over. I am surprised that, despite the fact that everybody in the family likes dark incidents and so so, nobody was abusing drugs. Wake me up when somebody hires Thing for a job...like he has a social security number. Did the film really start the gothic trend where stupid kids in high school were dressing up all in black and pretending to have mental and emotional problems? All in all, The Addams Family is a terrible piece of rubbish that manages to make time to crawl very slowly."
3,Clever and Ghoulish,"I can say this much...Christina Ricci. Enough said right there, but I might also mention it's not nearly as lame as the T.V. versions or the pathetic Munsters. Did I mention Christina Ricci?"
2,Gothic Icon,Uncle fester reappaers after 25 years in the Bermuda Triangle. Gomez and Morticia plan to wake the dead. Based on the cartoon and TV series.
4,Fun Halloween movie,"This has always been one of my favorites - though possible more for nostalgia than quality. It is slapstick, goofy humor which is fun for everyone, and definitely ok for the whole family. Though it may have some slightly creepy parts, I don't think it is anything inappropriate for a PG audience. The costumes and sets are elaborate and fun to watch."
4,Addams Family,"A mindless movie with a very dumb plot, but being the owner of the pinball machine that takes all it's verbage from the movie, I wanted to own a copy.The grandchildren thoroghly enjoy the movie!"
3,Not in spanish!!!,"I forgot to see: this movie it's not in spanish, big deal when you need it!muy linda película igual,"
3,Ooky and Creepy but the sequel is better.,"Plot mechanics muddle everything in this so-so big screen version of the entertaining 60's t.v. show based on the famous New Yorker cartoons. The screenwriters have altered the original family and given us a rather ordinary predictable plot that involves an Uncle Fester imposter (Christopher Lloyd) which alters the chemistry of the well-known family. It's called fixing something that wasn't broken. They spend too much time setting up and positioning the characters.The casting is quite good, and there are some funny moments and extremely inventive camera-work, but the script isn't sharp enough and instead of being dark, campy and clever, it's often strained and stupid.Tops are the perfectly cast Angelica Huston, and Christini Ricci with Raul Julia being an acceptable Gomez.The sequel Addams Family Value is much better.Chris Jarmick, Author of The Glass Cocoon with Serena F. Holder...."
5,Far-Out Fun for the Whole Family,"If you're looking for a comedy that's a little out of this world, than this is the one. Wonderfully acted by Raul Julia, Anjelica Huston, and Christopher Lloyd, this film follows the Addams Family as Gomez searches for his long-lost brother Fester. END"
4,good funny humor,this is one of the better comedies out there. the characters were well recreated too.
2,"Slow, marginally entertaining","While the scenes and acting were good and were mostly faithful to the original TV show, the movie plodded along and at a couple points had us asking whether it was over yet."
5,Wickedly Funny! Devishly Entertaining!,"I have alway's been a fan of The Addam's Family TV show of the 1960's & when the movie came out in 91 I thought it was just another lousey re-make of an old TV classic. By time it came on video something inside me was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back.The cast gives suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, & Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester. When a greedy woman & her son get hold of the story & hear about the Addams' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold of the family fortune. Some of the most funny parts are watching Wendsday & Pugsly ""play"" with their electric chairs & butcher knives. A MUST SEE!"
3,for fans only,this is the classic case of a movie that is only for fans of the tv show but the sequel is another story
4,Another Childhood Favorite!!!,"Ever since I was a kid, I've really liked this movie. I also remember at the beginning of the movie when they show Thing walking, when I was a kid I thought Thing was gonna come out of the tv and get me. It has a really good storyline. Abigail Craven and Tully Alford plan to steal money from the Addams estate. They use Uncle Fester to go and steal it. Fester had lost his memory and doesn't know he's the 'real' Fester. Soon, Fester starts to feel like part of the family and doesn't want to go through the plan. I love how everyone in the family is gothic! Morticia is extremely sexy! If you love the comics or tv series, you'll love THE ADDAMS FAMILY!!!"
4,Great look at the feastival!,"I thought this was a great book - especially for someone just learning about this like me. The writing is easy to get into (in some cases a bit too cutsy I'm afraid but I looked past that). I enjoyed the section on the history of halloween across cultures although in some ways it seemed like too much of a high level synopsis but it was an ok introduction. The section on halloween symbols was excellent since we see all these things typically at halloween (black cats, witch hats etc). There are some fun divinations which include runes. And there are of course blessings and recipes etc. I think this would be a great family book - to give kids (all of us really) a bit more meaning to the day rather than just getting a stash of candy from the neighbors. Definitely a great introduction and fun stuff to do. I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 since I was expecting a bit more substance but its fun nonetheless."
4,Great Halloween reading!,"I really like it because, it really gives you a whole picture of the backgroud of Halloween, and its symbolism.And also has good recipes!"
5,Great book on Halloween!,"Great book with lots of good information about the history of Halloween, myths and superstitions and recipes. Would recommend to friends and family"
1,Halloween,"There are real meanings for the celebration of ""Halloween"". Those who are looking for reality won't find it here. Try the search engines under Paganism or Wicca or Goddess Religions. You'll find what you're looking for there. This book is well let's just say ""cutesy"" maybe and like a lot of others on this subject. If you like the author then read her book, this one is about as good as her others. If you want something more substantial and for the more mature crowd, then try Adler, Starhawk, Leek and the rest of the legitimate witches around. You'll find them a bit more informative without the kiddy type appeal."
1,Not an accurate representation of Christianity,"Obviously the writer needs to do more research on Christianity ,because I am a believer and I was highly offended by the authors lack of knowledge in the most basic Christ Followers beliefs!He or she wrote that the new testament is based primarily on Roman beliefs and that is not at all factual.Their are many other discrepancies present. I believe the author should talk about things that they understand and the author should have a better understanding of the subject matter."
3,new kid on the block,I am a newcomer to the craft. I bought the book to enrichen my knowledge of history and techniques of the craft. The book did a very good job in presenting background information. It was an easy read. Ravenwolf knows her way around this art. Holloween is the most imporant of holidays to us. I am in the search for powerful love and attraction spells. I did not find that here. Any suggestions on where I can look.
1,O Rating For 0 Book,"Really if it's not even published why is it here? Hopefully it will not be published. Other works you have attempted to write and call 'books' are filled with such foolishness about the Craft that it is impossible for anyone to know what you as a writer are trying to establish in the literary field. It is obvious you have many names and many beliefs which have shown as contradictions to one another throughout your books. Even many of the young people are picking up on it. But some of the youth are much more aware and not as gullble as adults in the Pagan world. But I don't have to tell you that. Otherwise you wouldn't bother to publish this book ""Costumes, Receipes and Spells"" Is it your contention to insist that all this is what the holiday Pagans celebrate is connected with. Oh, Silver your truths are beginning to come out, don't you think? What goes round, comes round and it comes round in multiples."
5,A Guide to Prepare You for Halloween!,"This book is for Wiccans and non-Wiccan alike. Some may say this book is fluff reading and in a way it is. In the beginning, Silver gives a historical account of the holiday. However, the rest of the book is mostly devoted to spells, home crafts, and cooking. I enjoyed reading this book and have tried and tested many of her recipes and spells. For instance, the pumpkin bread and the Green Man cake recipes come with my seal of approval! As Halloween grows near, I have repeatedly referred back to this book and many of the pages have been dog-earred. I highly recommend this book!"
5,It is exactly what the title says.,"I found this book to be a wonderful informative book for all ages and all faiths. I do not believe I ""just fell off the tomato truck"" by saying that. Silver writes very simplistic for all to comprehend and enjoy. The history was covered fantastically. My husband and daughter both enjoyed the recipes. I think she has wonderful ideas to include in the celebration of Halloween, for EVERYONE. I think just the background information alone is well worth the purchase price of this book. Bright Blessings!"
3,"Great history of Halloween, don't expect anything else",Very complete history of Halloween as well as review of spells and holliday symbols. Contains a few original recipes. No color photos or decorating ideas.
3,someone help me here,"okay i am confused are people complaining because she doesnt write the books in her real name or that she has two different names for writing books. and if you complain about her not using her real name you should complain about starhawk, amber K, etc that dont use their real names. there is nothing wrong with pseunydoms, geez samuel clemens ussed mark twain now are you all gonna whine about that"
3,Interesting Read,This is an interesting little book on Halloween. It gives cultural insight to several of our modern day traditions. I'd recommend it for Halloween reading.
5,Very nice,"This is great, and a lot of fun, I love to read all of this book over and over, a lot of info in it, and Silver Ravenwolf is wonderful :)"
3,Okay Okay,Looking for something for my kids for a fun halloween stories. It is interesting but many of the stories were for older readers and listeners not for smaller childern.
3,rob t,the concert is good but very short .only 8 songs and dolby 5.1 cannot be selected it plays only dolby 2.0.
2,disappointed,"The quality of the printing in this book is terrible. I can barely read it and can not tell anything from the pictures. I am also disappointed because Amazon does not offer the chance to read some of the pages to see what a book has. I want a book about trees that gives details about the trees and their characteristics, so that I can pick the trees for my situation."
3,"Very Technical, not a guide on 'how to' at altitude","This book reads like a scientific paper. It is packed with altitude-study results and technical scientific information and discussion. It seems to mainly conclude that:Each undividual must use 'trial and error' with respect to how their body responds to altitude, how much time to spend there, when to leave altitude prior to racing, etc.There is a lot to learn about what exactly happens at the chemical level in your body. But after reading this book you may not be much better off at knowing what to do in your own altitude training, in practical terms.[Reviewer is Female sub-9:00/3k, sub-2:40:00 marathon]"
4,Good looking necklace for a man.,"Nice necklace - looks great on my guy. And so inexpensive! Shipping is a little high for the size/weight, though."
3,Historical Reference,"This is an interesting look at the history f the early days of woodcarving as a hobby. It is not an instructional book for the beginner, as there are no detailed how-to projects, rater it gives an overview of all of the styles of what we consider ""classical""carving and whittling. An interesting read and worth the modest price."
3,The begining of Aids,"Some of these movies where made on a time when Aids was an uncontrolable desease, but now its a matter almost of Internal Medecine, so it probably was a very good movie years ago, but now is ok, not very true for our times."
1,Makes you want to invent new swear words,"This is by far the worst PRODUCT I have ever purchased. I hate this coffee maker. I paid $79 for this item and I want to smash it with a hammer. I'm not a violent person but when coffee floods your counter you want to crush it. The only way to safely make a pot of coffee is to place it in the sink for fear of flooding. Even with the lid perfectly clean and on properly, it leaks coffee between the carafe and the lid.To boot, pouring water into the reservoir is a chore & no matter how careful you are, you will have coffee on the counter. Like another reviewer the clock does not keep time. You need to reset it on a regular basis.For the first 30 days or so I actually liked the thing but as you can tell my opinion has definitely changed. Good luck to you if you buy this product."
1,2 out of 2 - Kaput!!!,"Absolutely love the design, am heartsick that my first unit and the replacement BOTH quit working after about 3-4 weeks.... local service NOT existent.... Amazon replacement policy super.... but basic design problem, methinks.... water flows all over occasionally and pc board stops working when wet with coffee..... just wish unit would work, and;or service center would be avail.... unit probably should be recalled.......Ron Romanski"
1,over priced plastic leaking doesn't keep coffee hot JUNK,No stars is what this should be. Where do I start??? The machine brews the coffee everywhere but into the caraffe. You will have coffee grinds and water all over your counter if you don't position the caraffe in the exact spot it needs to be (so forget setting the timer for the a.m. or you will be needing your mop). The so called thermal caraffe is junk. Plan on a refill 15 minutes after your first cup? You'll have to nuke it as the thermal caraffe does not keep coffee warm at all. You know those little holes that the coffee pours into during brewing...I think it lets the heat out as well. This is the WORST coffee machine I have ever owned and it is the most expensive one I have ever owned. I'm going back to the nine ninety nine specials. At least they work.
1,Poor performance,"This brand was my 2nd Delonghi thermal carafe model in 2 months, after the first one broke after 5 weeks. This one worked wonderfully for about 4 weeks until one morning. I came in and found coffee all over the counter. I thought I had not aligned the pot properly or something. After another week of dealing with this, the electrical system shorted out due to all the coffee spills. This coffee maker made the best coffee and the carafe kept it hot all day. I don't know what happened and we couldn't get it resolved. We purchased a Cuisinart with a 3 yr warranty (not the one that grinds coffee) and has worked great for 6 weeks."
2,Poor,"You get what you pay for. This hard hat offers very little protection, and it doesn't have enough adjustments to make it fit properly.Get something better. A lot better."
1,Bad Software But Great Hard Drive Case,I couldn't use the software at all. I emailed the company and never heard from them. So I had to just install my new hard drive and use my restore disks. I don't any of my programs that I got from Giveaway of the Day among others. They are still setting on the old hard drive though. I don't know if I can get those back or not without buying more software and getting the operating system too. The product claims that it's so ease but it's anything but that. The product created more problems. The only good thing about the product is that now I have a nice protective case to store my old hard drive.
1,Doesn't work with Dell Laptops,"I have attempted to clone hard drives two different times: once on my Latitude D820 and again on my Latitude E8400. Both times were a complete disaster. Somehow I had neglected to check the reviews, where I now find that this product is not compatible with Dell. No wonder I had such problems. A perfect waste of money! All because Apricorn doesn't caution the purchaser about this problem."
5,Apricorn EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL EZ Upgrade Universal Notebook Hard Drive Upgrade Kit,This kit works as advertised and did an awesome job when I upgraded my laptop hard drive. The whole process took less than an hour and I now have a 100 GB backup (the old drive) that I can use with the case that's provided. Its worth the money.
3,good usb drive,Hi the product was advertised as being compatible w/ windows 7... however drive would not boot after cloning with Apricorn software. Works great as a USB drive and windows 7 comes with an image creator so no problem. Haven't tried a 3.5 PATA but 2.5 SATA fits great. nice case
4,"All good, but...","Everything worked as advertised with one minor modification that had to be made on the fly. Seems the Lenovo R60 HDDs include a mount of some sort that had to be *carefully* removed from the original drive before it could be installed in the Apricorn chassis.Its a little un-nerving to do ad-hoc surgery on your fully-populated HDD *before* the cloning attempt.Depending on how comfortable/handy you are with a screwdriver around your good HDD, this solution may or may not be worth the risk."
4,Great product but watch out for the packaging!,"I used the Apricorn upgrade kit to upgrade my HP laptop from 60 Gb to 250 Gb. Once I obtained the HD upgrade instructions from HP, I found that it was easy to use. The new HD snapped into the external enclosure without any need for tools. I connected the HD with the enclosed USB cable. I booted the laptop from the included CD and cloned my old HD to the new. Then I removed the new HD from the enclosure, removed the old HD from the laptop (and I needed a Phillips head screwdriver for this), and swapped the two drives. It took about 20 minutes of hands on time and maybe 3 hours to transfer the data. One word of warning, the product is encased in a difficult clamshell plastic package. I cut my finger on the plastic while attempting to remove the product. I would advise that you wear gloves when unpacking the product!"
1,No not EZ,When I first got this I tried to use it with the quick instructions on the package. Big mistake. I wasted hours this way. Only after I downloaded the detailed instructions from their website was I able to get it to work properly.
4,Cheap But Gets The Job Done Well,"I've used this several times in interoffice repairs. It needs a bigger power supply and better connections. This really does work well, just don't bump it during the clone operation. The Apricot Software rocks; It's the best out there I think. This unit is good for one to five drive exchange jobs then its worn out!"
5,Cloning made easy,"I needed to clone a laptop hard drive onto a larger one. The computer stores wanted to charge a couple hundred to do the cloning and I figured I could buy the hardware to do it myself for cheaper. This upgrade kit was the easy way to do clone the drive. It was mostly a little waiting around for it to finish so I went and watched a movie while it worked.I like that this kit will do ATA and SATA drives. And once you clone to the new drive, you can use the old drive in the Apricorn kit as an external backup drive.This kit made the cloning very simple and I definitely recommend this product to anyone who is running out of space on their laptop hard drive."
2,EZ gig II would not load,"EZ GIG II would not load up. Will never buy this brand software again. Very disappointed that you pay for something and expect it to work it doesn't. Tried contacting support, with no success. So this will be a never recommend them to anyone. PRODUCT SUCKED"
4,"Nice idea, but beware if you have a Dell with Media Direct!","This is a great item that should have made upgrading my notebook's hard drive really easy. However, there is a known issue with this product on a Dell computer with Media Direct. I WISH THIS HAD BEEN NOTED IN THE DIRECTIONS! The problem can be avoided just by not copying one particular file. However, if you run through the whole installation without the extra steps you will get the blue screen of death and the upgrade doesn't work.Once I called technical support, they sent me an email that explained how to fix the problem. It took me a lot of extra time to ""fix"" what I could have avoided in the first place.[...]In summary, this product did work, and I was able to use it to upgrade my hard drive. However, I wish I had been told before hand that it needed and extra step to work with my Dell computer."
3,Drive enclosure doesn't work.,"The title says it all. Loaded the new drive in it, plugged it in and nada, zip, zero, nyet. Not DOA: the light comes on so power is getting to the unit; and I could feel the disk drive running. Tried all the usual ways (ie disk management, etc) and still nothing. Pulled the drive from an older laptop -- I know that drive works -- and got the exact same results.Called the Apricorn tech support and they said, given what I had done, to return it for a replacement. Alas, Amazon does NOT allow return of this item. So I'm either I'm out the $45 or so the package costs, or I shell out another $20 to $35 for a new enclosure at Circuit City. OH, and I have a nice new, expensive, drive I can't use."
5,Stressless upgrade,"I upgraded the hard drive in my ancient Compaq Armada E500 laptop from a 12 Gig to a 40 Gig. This package made it an unbelievable smooth and stressless process. Everything went as advertised, software worked great, and now I have a spare external drive as well. I highly recommend this. I was dreading this upgrade, and it turned out to be easy."
5,Simply amazing,"There's the old adage about, ""If it seems to be too good to be true, it probably is."" This product defies that logic. It seems too good to be true, but it is.I just changed out my Dell laptop Inspiron 60GB original drive with a 160 WD using the EZ GIG software. It went flawlessly. I cloned the original drive in a little over an hour. Another 10 minutes to replace the existing with the cloned, and voila!!EZ Gig software as an added feature also allows you to image a disk (as opposed to simply cloning), and offers the ability to create a bootable restore CD. I can't find anything about this software that isn't superb."
2,Terrible packaging,The kit came in one of those treacherous plastic molded shells designed to hang on a store display. It took almost 10 minutes and several bloody fingers to access the contents. Of course the picture on the Amazon website does not show this egregious over-packaging.
2,Hostile Packaging,"I am just getting started. Took me several minute just to open the package. This is one of those welded clear plastic packages. Just cutting one or two sides of the package is not enough. With it's 3d standing plastic shape it is even harder than a normal welded plastic packaging. At least for web / mail orders, it would be desirable to minimize the packing, reduce waste, save blood, and save time. Now to actually try the product."
5,Great update product!!!,"This upgrade product rocks! I used this kit to upgrade my 3-year old Gateway M320 40gb hard drive to WD 120 Scorpio. Total time (after reading the instructions carefully) from chkdsk and defrag old drive to swapping in new drive and successful bootup--2 1/2 hours. An anxious moment when the initial bootup takes a while, then joy to see this product did exactly what it says it will do!! Looking forward to try the other features of the software, and using the old drive for backups and extra storage!!"
4,Apricorn Rules on this one!,"Apricorn EZ Upgrade Universal Hard Drive Upgrade Kit ( EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL )Have you ever dealt with a technically convoluted problem?Try cloning or upgrading a dying HD in a laptop.Then try it with this tool!Awesome difference!Great product, reasonable price, Amazon provided maximum distribution skills and perks. Thanks to all."
5,Works like a charm!,"The 20 GB hard drive in my wife's notebook PC was almost full and we wanted to upgrade to a larger drive while preserving all of her programs, data, settings, etc. I did a search and found EZ Gig to be the preferred notebook hard drive upgrade/replacement solution.It comes with excellent instructions and everything you need to get the job done (except the new drive which is purchased separately). It took less than 30 minutes to install the software and hardware, make a backup image of the old drive, start the cloning process, and install the new drive in the notebook PC. Obviously, the copying process can take a few hours, but that can be done at night or on the weekend when the PC is not in use.This is an outstanding product and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to upgrade/replace the hard drive in their notebook PC."
4,Works once you get the correct software version!!!,"Product gets a 4, Apricorn Support gets a 1!!This product ships with a CD that is version 2 of the EZ GIG software. It does not work with laptops that have a separate partition for system recovery, but Apricorn support does not have a clue to that issue.Once you get Apricorn to give you the key to the latest version, which is version 8, and create a install cd for it the software works fine.Get the latest version before you start your upgrade. You will save yourself many hours of frustration."
1,Not for Dell Computer's with Media Direct,"I ordered this and was excited to be getting a larger hard drive. The process went smoothly, then I put in the new drive and it said ""hard drive failure"". What the heck! I tried to run it again and guess what?... It does not even recognize it as a hard drive now.Called technical support and they gave me about 100 things to do to correct it. Took about 18 hours. You would think with Dell computers they might put a caveat on their product that it doesn't work. Totally unprofessional!!"
1,Not for Dell LapTop with Media Direct,If you have a Dell LapTop with Media Direct; do your home work. This product may work fine on other systems and I bet it does - BUT Dell is a living H*LL as the MediaDirect software on the HD is not copyable and corrupts the copying process. They (Apricorn) will send a work around but I have not figured it out yet (You can not talk to anyone). I have MediaDirect 2 on my HD. How do you know?Go to MyComputer -RightClick- Storeage - Disk Management. And as you look at the Hard drives you will see the partitions if you only see three - then you have MediaDirect 2 - meaning it is invisible. And then you should just forget it.
1,"MIght work for someone else, but not me","I tried it on my laptop first. It took a long time to create the image on the new HD from the old HD. After I replaced the new HD in to the laptop, it powered up but stopped on a blank screen with a blinking cursor. So I tried it on a desktop. The result was the same even though it was stuck on a different screen. I wasted a day and a half(about 20 hours) without getting anywhere. Returned it for refund. I think products like this have to rouburst, and easy to install. However when messing with the registry of the OS, it can get very tricky for different brand/type of computers."
3,Good for XP/Vista laptops only,"I bought this product firmly believing I could use it on my old laptop which has Windows ME. Well, it doesn't work. I tried everything the skimpy instructions said to do, even downloaded new drivers,etc. nothing worked. Called tech support, they couldn't help. Only way to put new 20 Gig HD in is to put the HD in and boot up with the recovery CD. Then I would have to reload all the software that I have on the laptop. I'm sure If I tried to use this on my XP laptop, it would work just fine, so I'm keeping it.So Don't buy this if you use any other Windows operating system than XP or Vista."
1,Waste of money - Caveat Emptor,"My computer would not recognize this upgrade kit with my Western Digital 250 gig PATA notebook drive.It showed up on my doorstep on Friday night, but by the time I realized I could not make it work by following the instructions, the west coast tech support closed for the weekend. I was persistent and surfed the web to find some help, and I found some of the other reviewers had the same problem as me.Frustrated on Saturday morning, I ran to my local computer store (Kaplan) and bought ANOTHER hard drive upgrade kit, but a different brand for 40 more bucks. The second hard drive kit I bought had a power cord and a USB cord, and it worked!(The apricorn unit only had a usb cable, but funny enough they list a power cable on their website as a recommended accessory)I would say buyer beware, unless you want to waste 40 bucks like me."
3,Not what I expected,"I may have done something wrong, but twice I tried cloning my hard drive onto my new one and both times the extra space, from a 60G to 320G, wasn't available on the new, bigger drive. I had a friend who is much more savvy with computers than I try it and he also had no luck. In the end I ended up just installing ubuntu on the new drive since I've been wanting to make the switch from MS anyway. Could be a good product that I just used wrong. Up to you if you wanna try it. May have better luck."
3,"Good, but not worth the money.","I was happy with the product. It's a nice enclosure. But the kit is just a hard drive enclosure (worth about $15) and third-party software that is available free online.I recommend buying a 2.5"" SATA hard drive enclosure and downloading the software yourself. You will save ~$20.Hope this helps!"
1,Problems with HP laptop,"I bought this product to assisst in upgrading my HP laptop hard drive. I was able to clone my old drive, but when I replaced the old drive with the new, the laptop wouldn't boot. Upon further investigation (and help from an engineer friend), I have learned that HP has a hidden system partition, and the cloning software was unable to access these tiles. So I'm stuck until I can get expert help, and even then, it may not work. Bottom line is it's not so EZ after all."
4,"Incredibly easy, but iffy instructions","Very easy BUT the instructions didn't work on my Thinkpad T61 with Vista. I hooked up my new 320GB drive via USB and inserted the CD and got nothing. Tried executing the Autorun and still nothing, so I powered off the laptop and rebooted with the CD in, and the menu came up. It took 1 1/2 hrs to copy 130GB to the new drive. All in all, and VERY good experience and I end up with my old 160GB drive as an external USB drive."
3,Didn't work for me,"The setup and installation were easy. The HD fit inside the enclosure perfectly. When I started the clone procedure however, I couldn't use SMART cloning and when I proceeded further, realized that after several hours unattended, the clone procedure was stuck at a certain point. In being totally fair, I believe there are a few bad sectors on the source drive that could have caused the problem. I was able to contact support who gave me some options, none of which were successful."
5,"Works as simply as stated...1,2,3 steps","This cloning kit does what it says it does. You insert the hard drive, clone it and swap the drives. I kept my old drive in case of ermegency but you can always format it and use it as an external as they state."
5,Great item to upgrade your laptop,"I have had 2 of these Apricom EZ-UP's and both were great (gave 1 to my dad). You can upgrade IDE and SATA type drives with the included USB enclosure case. This kit also includes easy to use upgrade software to clone (copy) the contents of your old hard drive over to the new one. The case only fits 2.5"" hardives or smaller and WILL NOT fit 3.5"" drives. Great item!"
2,Not so good for my T40 Thinkpad,"I have an IBM Thinkpad T40, current disk sapce is C Drive 10, D: 30. I purchased a new hard ddrive along with the EZ Up to increase my C Drive. It cloned my hard drive easily and quickly. Only problem is that is will not increase the size of my C Drive. It puts all the new space on the D Drive which defeats the purpose.I've been inspected by an Apricorn rep to purchase Partition Magic or some other program that can move partitions. I've already spent $150 on a pretty old laptop, now spend another $60. At this point is would have been better to simply buy a new machine. Thats what I should have done long ago."
2,Doesn't work for me,"Load the software and it simply gives and error when I try to duplicate my drives that the sizes do not match. I write software and this is just wrong. The software should not throw an error, but rather fix the problem for me automatically. It should adjust the cluster sizes (or whatever) so that it can copy or it should figure out another way to copy the data. It has made both my upgrade drive and this software useless. The only good thing about this product is the USB casing that comes with the software and that's why I am not giving it a one.Just a warning that it probably won't work for you if you are upgrading to a different drive. In my case I was upgrading from a 500GB to 750GB drive."
4,Solid program and case,"Easy setup and install. The one thing I didn't know is that the CD is a bootable cd and you can copy that way as well, which was a bonus. The down side to using the program through the bootable CD is that you can't specify the new partitions without losing space as unpartitioned. Simple drive enclosure that allows either EIDE or SATA drives simply by flipping the drive around with connectors on either side. USB powered or can be powered with an AC Adapter (not supplied though). Although I haven't tested it yet, I think the software will allow you to use any USB externally enclosed drive, so you could clone a 3.5"" as well.All told, a solid program with a well built drive enclosure and usb cable."
2,Not for Windows 7 64bit AS Stated!,"When I received this unit I went over the installation guide and ran the BOOT Disk as stated for Windows 7 64bit and the software crashed everytime. I installed the software as stated not to to try and see if it would work, NO LUCK. The HDD cabinet and USB cord were good quality and I just ended up using them for my old HDD after I took it out of my Laptop as an external drive for backing up my computer."
1,Dell 700/710m laptop owner beware,"This product makes a copy of the new disk from old disk. But it is not bootable using the EZ GIG 2 software. I have Dell Media Experiance but not Dell Media direct. After trying for two weeks and researching I got hold of tech support, really. Waited on hold for 45 min. After talking with them. I was told it does not work for the dell 700/710m laptops. So now instead of using my new 120GB drive to replace my 80 GB drive. I have another 120GB external drive. But it does have all my files and programs.Sadly it was a waste of money."
5,Apricorn: No hassle software for upgrading your laptop hard-drive,"I have a Dell Alienware laptop that I bought recently. However, I was filling up the hard-drive faster than I expected, so I wanted to upgrade. So, I bought a WD Scorpio Blue 500 GB hard-drive for $55 and the Apricorn EZ-UP-UNIVERSAL EZ Upgrade Universal Notebook Hard Drive Upgrade Kit for $35. The replacement of the hard-drive was incredibly simple, the Apricorn software literally made it one-click! Place the new drive in the enclosure provided by Apricorn, connect it via USB to your laptop, run the Apricorn software, and it does the entire copying! Then, remove the new drive from the enclosure, replace the old drive in the laptop with the new one, and you are done! Highly recommended."
2,Not exactly EZ,"I've read reviews that really made this sound easy, but...If you have any difficulty at all, forget about talking to tech support. You will not talk to anyone on the phone, even after waiting two hours in the phone que. Email support only, which means it may take a week or more to have a meaningful conversation with tech support.If you have any trouble you are basically on your own.The hardware looks to be good quality as does the software, but for some reason the software refused to complete the clone. It would stop at around 90% copied and refuse to go any further. I tried all the clone routines on the Apricorn FAQs and the common solutions on their support phone tree to no avail. I ran diagnostics on the new drive and everything looked fine, tried to clone again with no success.My advice: If it doesn't work right out of the box, return it for a refund. You will get zero support with this product."
2,Upgrade kit hardware failed,"I spent most of a day trying to get the EZ Upgrade package to work on my Acer Aspire 5920g laptop. After 4 calls to the support line, creating a new DVD boot disk from an ISO image the Support team sent me of the newest software version, swapping current and new Harddrives between the laptop and the EZ external drive enclosure several times, and running chkdsk and defrag on my current drive to confirm it did not have any bad sectors, it was finally determined that the external harddrive enclosure I received in the EZ Upgrade package was defective. Support has sent me an RMA number and I'm sending back the enclosure for replacement. I'll update this review if a new enclosure solves the problem.The product looks sophisticated and well thought-out. Maybe I just got the rare lemon."
5,Motivating Employees for Dummies,This is a great book. Love it. Would definitely suggest it to anyone that wants a good read. Thank you.
3,Not a bad little book,"I enjoyed the book mostly, until the last chapter, which he wrote 15 years later and in which he basically says ""Forget everything I wrote about 15 years ago. Things have changed, and those observations don't apply anymore."" After absorbing the rest of the book, it kind of dampened my enjoyment. I am now left with the thought that he should have just written a new book with his updated views, using the benefit of the years of experience since the first book. It being the first book I have read on this subject, I don't have anything else to compare it to, but I feel sure there are better books out there that don't contradict themselves."
4,Short and sweet...,"This is a short little guide to writing comics. It was originally written in Alan Moore's early days, and then an afterword was added. Basically, in the first 3/4's of the book he goes through the( his?) creative process in a more or less step by step fashion. It is pretty interesting and has a lot of insight. I actually thought is was more helpful than either of the two Eisner books, but I may be a snotty nosed punk (I am a snotty nosed punk so...). The last section, the afterword, takes the rest of the book and stands it on its ear. I was a bit let down by it, but in twenty years I'm sure it will make perfect sense."
2,comic book format,"As the band ""Killing Joke"" sings, ""Alan Moore knows the score"" -- but as much as I love comic books, and appreciate Mr. Moore, I was disappointed with this purchase.It's a comic book format reprint of an article by Moore about comic books from 2004 or such.Not that Moore isn't the best of the best of writers, but this is not ""a book"" and this is not something written for fans or wannabe writers to gain tremendous insight into writing comic books from Alan Moore's perspective.Instead, it's a clumsy attempt to score some sales based on Moore's name and legacy, by merely reprinting and repackaging an interesting article.Even with current comic book prices being what they are, I'd rather buy two comic books than this one."
3,Heavily illustrated? Nope,"Alan Moore has serious chops when it comes to writing for comics. This brief comic-sized primer tops out at about 50 pages and most of the piece is over twenty-five years old. In his 5-page 'Afterwords' (now almost a decade old itself), Moore says he thinks he did a pretty good job but admits his viewpoint is dated and that he'd offer a new perspective if he were to do a new article on writing for comics. Is it worth it? It is if you are a fan of Alan Moore. It's especially worth it if you buy it at less than cover price -- Amazon currently has the title available for about two bucks.Don't expect to see a ""heavily illustrated"" article, however, despite the publisher's promise. Every two or three pages, you'll find a single, rather small b&w; illustration that brings nothing new to the words around it. The illustrations are adequately done but nothing spectacular."
2,"Yeah, what ever...","i'm a fan of Alan Moore, I just love his plots, but this booklet is clearly NOT intended for you to learn anything about script writing or anything, it's really just an interview of the author. Don't expect to learn anything about it. However, if you are a fan of Alan Moore, then you will surely enjoy reading it, but not a lot..."
2,Alan Moore's writing for comics,"I wanted more of a ""how to book"" on comic writing, concerning breaking in, making contacts, etc. Too much drawing plot comparisons and witty talk. It's a small enough book to skim through and I didn't find what I was looking for. Maybe it helps out the aleady established comic writer? But for those of us who have yet to make it. Nah."
3,comic writing,"I have only glanced through this book, haven't had a chance to actually read it, but that is what it looks like , there are no drawings as much as it is to be used for hints to write"
5,Classic Juice Newton,"Juice Newton holds a special place in the hearts of my wife and myself. Her songs were very much a part of our courtship. Her rendition of""The Sweetest Thing"" has been quite difficult to find in its original arrangement using the pedal steel guitar. Through much searching, I was able to find this CD, ""Country Classics"", which does indeed contain her song ""The Sweetest Thing"" in its original pedal steel arrangement. This piece brings back many very fond memories for my wife and I."
4,Great Resource,"I carry this with me to clinical rotations and have used it for case studies. One of the downfalls is that not each disease is covered as it claims, and had to seek elsewhere for pertinent information. Other than that, it is great to have, and better than the text, which has more information than what is really necessary."
5,Great addition to anyone's home!,"We bought this wine rack because it was one of few nice (and relatively affordable) wine racks we could find in this shade of wood to match our other furniture.The great thing about it is it's small and compact (whether in a house or in a 600 sq. foot apartment!), it has a nice top that you can use to display things on or put pictures on - however you want to decorate, and since it holds our wine glasses (red and white and champagne) it frees up space in our cabinets for coffee mugs, beer mugs, and regular juice glasses.Overall, we've been very happy with this product!"
2,"About Justin Martyr, Not By Him","I ordered this and was disappointed to find that it was like Cliff's Notes. It's virtually useless unless you already have a copy of Justin's writings (and who does?). I suppose for six bucks I shouldn't complain.Would it really have killed them to provide some extra pages of his writings, in keeping with the ambiguous title? Say, twenty or thirty pages. It's not like they're copyrighted by the author's estate. Heck, I can probably grab an English translation of Justin off the web for free. Hey wait a minute, why didn't I think of that before buying this thing?"
4,A Companion for the Patristic Theology Novice,"Shepherd's Notes accommodate readers with the basic teachings and ideas of some of Christianity's greatest thinkers. This particular volume contains sound, general overviews of all of St Justin Martyr's writings and is, overall, a good primer for his theological and polemical works. It must be noted that Shepherd's Notes is evangelical in orientation but it is pretty fair to Catholic tradition. Excellent for intro-theology students."
4,A satisfying teaser,"Justin Martyr's Apologies are phenomenal. This book is just a quick glimpse at his works, but gives a real flavor of his passion and thinking. Profoundly relevant--especially for the church in America. He touches on issues such as engagement with cultural themes in explaining Christianity to unbelievers as well as persecution, imprisonment, torture and death for confessing faith in Christ. It's very convicting when considering how poorly and impatiently we ""suffer"" through our modern-day indignities. Very convicting."
5,My Favorite Christmas Album,One of the best a cappella blends I've ever heard! Wonderful arrangements of carols sung as they ought to be sung.My very favorite Christmas album of all time!
2,"Great magazine, but not from Amazon...","Come on, the cover price is only $8 USD. You can still purchase it at any comic book dealer and probably most book stores that have the ability to special order magazines as well as books.It's a great magazine but, unless you don't have a choice, don't pay Amazon their extortion prices for it..."
4,Great magazine;but Amazon is too expensive!,"Amazon usually has great prices on their merchandise, but not with this magazine subscription. My daughter is a big fan of Doctor Who, and has bought this magazine each month for the last couple years, at our local Borders bookstore for $7.99 plus tax. You just have to check each month to make sure you don't miss an issue, but it's a lot cheaper than what they want here."
4,Dr Who magazine Subscription.,"Love this magazine. Lets me keep up with the Dr Who family. DVD release plans, episode reviews, torchwood, Sarah Jane Adventures. Lots of pictures and info."
3,Cute book for younger kids,This is a a cute book for Grade 3 and under. I had planned to use it with 5th graders but it's too young.
5,A teacher's story,"Our elementary school gives a copy of this book to each teacher leaving at the end of a school year, whether transferring or retiring. It is a wonderful book that becomes a treasured memory of their years with us. I was pleased to see how quick and easy it was to order through Amazon.com AND they had plenty of books on hand!"
5,extremely touching,"This is one of my favorite children's books. It is a simple and beautiful story--no matter how many times I read it, I have a hard time getting through it without tearing up. It's also a great way to introduce young children to biography and to one-room schoolhouse days. I recently donated this book to my grandmother's hometown library as a very appropriate tribute to her memory--as she was also a teacher who touched many lives, in school and out, as most true teachers do."
1,Five LIve Yardbirds,"My husband asked for this for his birthday. While I was glad to find it, it was truly awful - like the worst of the '60s garage band sound."
5,how work modem,i want to found how work rockwell 2chip modem and what is there port address and how i can write a program or code for it with visual c++ 6
1,"Clumsy composition, old-style questions in CD","Compared with other current GRE reference books (ETS powerprep: 5 stars, Kaplan's GRE: 4 stars), this GRE book seems to be just one star. Clumsy composition and the author spreaded just one GRE practical test for the large volume of the book. Enclosed CD will also make you disappointed. Totally different styled background format from official GRE test and IF YOU QUIT THE TEST BY MISTAKE, YOU CAN NEVER ACCESS THE TEST PART AGAIN. Stupid software! Don't spend the money for this book. ETS Powerprep will be enough for high score."
3,A good test prep tool,"I found the book to be helpful in preparing for the format and the content (to an extent) of the test. I found the practice tests both in the book and with the CD to be very helpful. I did not have any problems with the software. The vocabulary words were not as helpful as I had hoped but the 'tricks' provided to analyze words even when you don't know them really helped me to get the score I needed the first time taking the test. Of course I did not see any exact questions or math problems on the test as in the practice, but the examples provided helped enough to solve most of them. The key is actually going through and doing the practice problems and understanding the concept of them. KNOW THE VOCABULARY and probably get additional words from another source prior to taking your GRE."
4,Yeow-za!,"Whoa! This CD is great! Karen's voice is in top form and the songs (like 2nd Chance, So Good, Brand New Day, I've Been Changed) arewonderful! IF you are trying to decide, let me tell you GET IT! getitgetitgetit! If only for ""A Secret Place""! mm-HM! Oh that song is so powerful! It really really is! I really recomend this to you!"
5,amazing,"All I gotta say is annointed, annointed, annointed. Ms. Karen Clark Sheard is annointed with the holy ghost the spirit the everything...lol By changing labels and working with producers such as Missy, this album is 100% better than the first album but still keeps the word of god in tact. I think this album is going to reach out to alot of people in this generation and will turn their life around. My favorites songs on the cd area ll of them but my favorite songs are , A secret place, Higher Ground, Be sure,Sacrafice,Only call on jesus well put it this way its all of them Im so thankful to listen to this cd everyday yall need to get this cd its worth the money."
4,Impressed but not blown away,"I give Karen her props. She did a good job however, I had higher expectations. She has some great cuts yet some of them were just not - taking me there. I would still buy some of her new albums. I can only give this a 4."
5,karen does it again,This is a wonderful project. It captures the essence of good singing and messages of hope... This audio is worth listening to.Great job!!! wow! what a effective ministry resource.
3,Karen Clark,"First I will start by saying I have been a fan of Karen Clark since she started under the leadership of her mom,Mattie Moss. I loved her album 'Finally Karen', but this album is really different and I'm not that excited about it as everyone else is. I do like , A Secret Place and A Brand New Day. I think the album will sell well but its not the Karen that i'm use to."
1,Crossing Over,If you liked Karen Clark's other CDs and the style of those CDs you should not purchase this CD. 2nd Chance is not for those of us who enjoyed her more traditional style.
2,HUH??,"What happened to Karen Clark-Sheard...you know Karen ""Balm in Gilead""-""Couldn't Tell it if I Tried""-Clark-Sheard???....I'm so confused right now and the cd is collecting dust. True Karen can sing but I promise I feel like something is missing. Definitely will never match the anointing and sincerity of FINALLY...I think the Clark Sisters are at their best live...I love the Clark Sisters and I bought 2nd Chance because of what I anticipated, but I must say I was really hurt. ""So Good"" was so fake to me...oh well, who am I to judge? I give it 2 stars simply because she is a Clark Sister...but there is always DORINDA and Twinkie though for those who want that REAL Clark gospel music..."
2,Title is misleading!!!!,"You would think that a DVD with an alluring girl on the cover and had the word ""SEX"" in the title would well, have SEX in the actual movie. But, you'd be completely wrong if you bought Phone Sex Fantasies because there is NO sex, real or simulated in the entire DVD! Basically, the girls talk dirty (sorta) and then take off their clothes. That's it."
4,Sweet and Wonderful,"I have always been a huge sucker for a relaxing lullaby, as well as uplifting childrens music. While I don't have any children of my own yet, I enjoy providing care for little ones at my church and this is a CD that I would definitely keep in the nursery. The first song - Jenny Rebecca - was the only one that I was not fond of. Being a fan of Olivia Newton John's performance in ""Grease"" it was interesting and wonderful to hear her voice in such a ""Warm and Tender"" environment."
3,'Warm and Tender' is a real sleeper,This must be a good collection of lullabies - it put me to sleep!
4,Vanity Project but great for naptime,"I bought this CD based on the reviews. Warm and Tender isnt all that great, its mostly a vanity project of OLJ singing song for her kids when they were little; but you know what? When played at naptime, they work! They are soothing and hummable and before you know it, you can hum along while patting the little ones to sleep. Add it to your collection when you get tired of hearing orchestration pieces, you wont be dissapointed."
3,OLIVIA'S LULLABY,"After her pseudo-sexy years on albums like PHYSICAL, TOTALLY HOT and SOUL KISS, Olivia began a series of introspective recordings like WARM AND TENDER. Going through personal life-changing events, Liv dedicated this collection of traditional lullabies and contemporary classics to her newborn daughter, Chloe.Olivia's breathy soprano is especially lovely and her long-time producer John Farrar provides lots of lush orchestral accompaniment. The tracks that work the most for me are THE TWELFTH OF NEVER, WARM AND TENDER, WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR and REACH OUT TO ME.The album is pleasant to listen to but it's not one of Olivia's best. It would be a nice album to listen to, sipping hot cocoa on a wintry night by the fireside."
4,Interesting & Thought Provoking,"Professor required this book for a psychology class on addictions. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you were just studying the topic intellectually - or if you have a sponsor who is prepared to walk you through the steps. The book does go through the 12 steps and encourages the reader to take part, but doing so without a sponsor may leave you with more issues. The author also seems to blur the lines a little between the model's loose religious perspective and Christian perspectives. One paragraph he'll refer to ""a higher power"" and the next paragraph he'll refer to ""God"" as if that is the mutual consensus. If you are religious or hold to theological views, you may find some parts of this book to be wishy-washy. It is not about the religion though, it's about addiction, so if you can separate the two, you may find it useful."
5,Church get well,"First step - Get Real! It's time for the church not to be afraid to admit they're dysfunctional. read this book. Also get ""A More Excellent Way"" by Pastor Henry Wright. Let's get the church and the body healed!"
5,A great book for new or old 12-steppers,"I read this book after I had worked through the steps, but I wish I had read it before. Miller does a great job breaking down each step and applying it to his own life. If you thought the steps were just for alcoholics, think again. This book will open your mind to behaviors that keep you stuck in the insanities of life. If your new to the steps or if you have lived them most of your life this book hits the spot."
5,Best bang for the buck,"Starlancer and Crimson Skies are the reasons I bought this game. As a flight sim and space sim fan, I could'n pass up this bargain."
4,Religion in America,"The usual series format is followed with pro and con positions on such controversial issues as: Is America a religious or a secular nation? What was the intent of the Founders regarding religion? What effect should or does religion have on American society? Does Christian fundamentalism threaten our freedom? What should be the role of religion in the public schools? Should religious doctrine influence decisions about abortion and traditional marriage? Materials chosen from periodical articles, speeches, and essays covering the entire spectrum from the far right to the liberal left make up the contents. Contact organizations, a bibliography, and index are included as is usual for this series. Even if the 2001 edition is owned, this balanced work should be considered because of the extremely up-to-date information on some very divisive issues that it provides. For teenage readers and adults.Reviewed by Robert A. Silver"
2,Disappointment,"If your going back and forth between this bag and the other bag (Classic Accessories 74877 Hitch Tote), get the other one, this one is crap. The material used is a very thin, paper-like material that you sometimes see items wrapped in during shipping. I was thinking (hoping?) it was nylon or gym bag-like material, but it's not. It's not very puncture proof. Also, there are no pockets or dividers, not really a big deal, just FYI."
4,"Entertaining read, interesting premise.","The previously noted criticisms of the work are accurate, but the book is a very readable piece of work which is not only fascinating, but most importantly entertaining!"
3,My thoughs on A Curse Of A Winter,"The Curse of a Winter Moon by Mary Casanova is about a boy Jean -Pierre, that is born on christmas eve. He is belived to be a Werewolf and his older brotherhas totake care of him.The message of the book seems to be when life gets tough just keep your head high and try to get through life.This book had alot of adventure twists and turns, as well as some scary parts. I didn't like the story's end very much. I though the story was sad."
2,Romp,"Predictably lame entry in the werewolf genre, similar to a B movie flick a la The Howling. The scares are few and far between after you've seen Howling V."
5,Haul Open Gun Ports! Avast! Loosen T'gallants! Huzzah!,"Another slendidly written masterpiece from Mr. Kent. Bolitho again sets his sails into thundering actions, a bit of romance, some nefarious villains, crisply-written battle scenes that almost deafen the reader. The age of sail is clearly defined in this ninth Bolitho adventure that is one of the best in the series. Plenty of historical flavor, the workings of a British warship (HMS Hyperion) at sea are marvelous to read. Wonderful character development and splintering decks and freezing sea spray for the nautical buffs. An outstanding addition to the series."
3,reaeoj,This would have been a great book but there were many variationsnot listed (eg the pow variation of the suzuki quadracer ). Someof the prices in this guide are like the other books and should be used as a reference. There are a lot of pictures which helps thisbook as a selling point.
5,Beyond Beautiful!,"I have purchased two nappycakes from Nappycakes by Shelli and I will be back for more! I bought two of them for baby shower gifts for friends, and was so impressed that I asked for one for my own new baby! They are so incredibly beautiful! I was also able to special order a custom color!The nappycake arrived packaged perfectly and all I had to do was remove it from the box and place it as the table's centerpiece. The customer service that I received was exceptional! I highly recommend Nappycakes by Shelli!"
4,great,this is an awesome product. i utilize it to the fullest extent and recommend it to everyone to purchase now.
1,Just plane bad cap.,"When I received this cap I thought I was getting a letter. The cap was crammed into a flat envelope. Terrible quality,very flimsy brim. Awful item. I don't know where the positive reviews came from. This is a cap I will NEVER wear. In fact it went from the envelope it came from straight into the trash where it belongs. Very bad buying experience would not ever buy from this seller again. This is NOT a military cap. It's a crap cap made in China."
4,Entertaining Collection,"While this is a reissue of an earlier publication, this story collection is an excellent first book for those new to Philip K. Dick, as I was. In his forward to this edition, Dick writes that good science fiction must offer the reader a truly new idea and ""it must be intellectually stimulating to the reader; it must invade his [or her] mind and wake it up to the possibility of something [s]he had not up to then thought of."" (The brackets are mine.)If we accept Dick's definition of good sci-fi, then this is truly good. The collection contains no stories that are ""bad,"" and many that are outstanding. My favorites include ""The Skull,"" the ""Infinites,"" ""The Variable Man,"" and ""Beyond Lies the Wub.""If you don't yet own a story collection of Dick's, this one would be a good place to start."
4,Great Wash Clothes!,"Although these are not #1 Quality towels, for the money, they are absolutely fabulous! Soft, rich and absorbent. Very nice quality and I've had many compliments on them. A couple of the reviews said ""low quality"" ""Wal-marty"", not true! These towels do not stiffen, fray, etc. With every wash the softness gets better and better. I can't afford the ""rich people"" towels, but I think these sure do come close!"
1,Must Be Seconds?,"These have to be seconds. Soon as I opened the packages.. I ordered 10 packages with 2 each inside I noticed frayed edges... a immediate ut oh to me. The seams aren't sewn smoothly all the way around there are strings hanging.Looked closer and the tags on them weren't in uniform spots. For the price I thought I would give them a shot so I washed them as advised by the manufactor before using. They came out of the washer and dryer as in different colors. A bad dye lot I guess. These washclothes ARE soft so thats why I gave them one star, however, they are badly sewn and I expected much more from Martex quality than this. Buyer beware."
5,SUPER SOFT WASH CLOTHS,"THESE WERE THE BEST WASH CLOTHS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, EXCEPT FOR THE BAND AROUND THEM. BUT THEY WERE SO SOFT, YOU DIDN'T MIND THE BAND. UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE"
2,Not as thick as I expected,"The washcloths are ""ok"" but I was really expecting athicker more absorbent washcloth that holds a lot ofsoap while in the shower. Good for the money I guess."
2,Disappointed,"The towels are as soft as advertised, but that's it. The towels are much smaller than advertised. I ordered grey, but received tan. I can't use them with my grey bathroom!"
2,So so,"Sorry, I just could not get into this book. It was to slow for me. I prefer something with a little more action. Not all books are for everyone and that is just my opion."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"This book was a huge disappointment. Sure, it lists prices for thousands of autographs, but the ""facsimiles"" section is a joke. I highly doubt anyone is losing sleep wondering if their ""Peggy Moran"", ""Bill Withers"" or ""Marjorie Ann Kent"" (who?) signatures are authentic or not, yet space is wasted with these names, while more famous, more collectable ones (Garland, Astaire, etc.) are left out. And to top it off, some of these examples are captioned with glaring typos: ""Michael Cain"", instead of ""Caine"", ""Kristy MacNichols"", instead of ""MacNichol"". And this guy's an expert?"
3,Best Modem better than imac internal modem,"I bought the Best Data 56USBPMAC modem from my local Mac Store after having a lot of trouble with my imac flat panel internal modem (apparently the internal modem couldn't handle phone line noise).The connection speed increased dramatically, from 27000 at best (sometimes the internal modem slowed down to 900) to over 42000. However, after a few days I started getting the error message that the modem could not be found, or the never-ending disconnect. I eventually discovered that after my computer had gone to sleep, I saw a light on the modem with the letter OH. I don't know what that meant, except perhaps ""on-hold""? Anyway, I've tried reconnecting the USB plug into the back of the computer after the computer has been sleeping and before trying to connect, and that seems to have solved the problem.That is a bit of a nuisance, but still tons better than the frustration with the internal modem disconnects and slow speed."
3,Good Modem When It Works,"The internal modem in my iMac died so I bought this one. Very simple to set up. But there seems to be an intermittant bug in the modem's software that causes problems with my computer (which is running OS 10.2.8). Without warning, the computer won't recognize the modem and I'll have to continually fiddle with iMac's network and modem settings.Other times, when I disconnect from being online, the computer will hang in the disconnect mode and look like it's in the process of disconnecting even though it's no longer online. When this happens the only solution I've found is to reboot my computer, which is a pain.Repeated emails and faxes to Best Data tech support have resulted in a total of zero responses from the company, so if tech support is important to you, avoid this modem."
1,Best Data 56K USB Modem Macintosh,As other reveiwers noted this modem cannot stay connected. You can reestablish connection by unplugging and plugging the USB but this is a pain. Instructions that come with modem are incomplete and do not give information about lights. Also Best Data tech support does not respond. There are bound to be better choices.
1,Not worth the title 'junk',"I purchased this device at my local Frys on an employee recommendation and also based on details on the box. I could not get my g4 1.25 dual to see the modem in spite of everything I tried. The tech support would not respond, the website has no mac drivers, my mac wouldnt recognize it as a USB device and the included instructions and the CD have no drivers or details that would be helpful. After a frustrating few weeks I gave up and returned this. The only thing it did properly was power on when connected to a usb port. Pathetic."
5,Great compilation of Billy Joe Royal's best songs.,"Billy Joe Royal was a very successful singer who helped define the Southern rock/pop scene in the 1960's. Great soulful pop songs delivered by a very distinctive vocalist. It helps that Billy Joe Royal had great songwriters like Joe South working with him. This album gives you a great compilation of Billy's best songs and big hits. If you are a Billy Joe Royal fan, or just curious about this part of the 1960's music scene, this album is worth owning. For more artists in the 60's Southern genre, also look into Joe South, Classics IV, Tommy Roe, etc."
4,Best of the Best -Billy Joe Royal,"Contains the Best of Billy Joe Royal hits including a rare radio hit from the 60,s ""Everything turned blue"""
3,"Fascinating, uplifting story, but poorly written","I read this book on the heels of Chris Rose's ""1 Dead in Attic: After Katrina."" Chris Rose mentions this book toward the end of his, and I thought reading a positive story would be a good balance after reading the details of post-Katrina New Orleans. The story of 9/11 and the people of Gander, Newfoundland is fascinating and uplifting, but the book itself is poorly written. Perhaps it is because the author is a reporter, but the emotional impact that should have been there just wasn't. The sentence structure and word choices made me think I was reading an elementary school student's report on what happened rather than a professional's rendition. Had the content of the tale not been so wonderful, I'd have given this book even a lower star rating. I rarely think a movie is better than a book, but in this case, I kept wishing for a movie version."
3,Interesting Subject but Poorly Written,"I found this book to be extremely interesting. It tells of a true story unknown to many. However, while the subject was excellent, the quality of the writing was poor. I would not conider this book a final product. It is similar to a draft, with words spelled incorrectly and improper grammar. The publishers should be ashamed for printing such a poor quality manuscript that had not been proof read."
3,too much missing,"too much missing for intellectual interest and the historical record: 1) no map of newfoundland (unbelievable!)2) not even one detailed example of the aerial feats accomplished 9/11 by gander's air traffic controllers3) especially in light of 2), where is timeline of the 38 flights, departure cities, and arrival time at gander?nevertheless, personal stories are wonderful. amazing that one story relates all the way back to the holocaust (50 years ago!). a good decision: no celebrity stories!"
1,HarperCollins rip-off,"This review is NOT about the book which deserves all the 5-star reviews it has garnered, but is about the unconscionable greedy price-gouging by the publisher.HarperCollins publishes a paperback version of this book for $7.95, a fair price, but they have the unmitigated gall to charge $13.77 for a Kindle ebook version, that has no paper cost, no ink or typesetting costs!!I had loaned my paperback version and it was not returned, so I was looking for a Kindle version, but I'll be damned if I'm going to pay almost twice as much for an ebook as for a paperback!"
5,Thank you all from a Newfoundland,"Hello, I am a 25 year old male from St. John's, Newfoundland. I just read all your comments on the warmth and hospitality of Newfoundland and a tear came to my eye. We have so much hardship in this part of Canada but the reason people live here is because of the people. The people in Newfoundland are some of the nicest folks in the world. Why else would we live on an island, with bad weather and the highest unemployment levels in Canada? Thank you all and peace be with you."
5,Close View of a Huge World,"Newfoundland is a grand place. It's mountains, it's shore, its unindustrialized heartland, its exploited sea -- all enormous. But the mighty beauty of its people has rarely been captured -- and never so well -- as in this depiction of the events, on the ground in Gander, Newfoundland -- that immediately followed the catacylsmic calamity of 9/11/01.Newfoundland is usually portrayed in aerial shots, showing contours and outlines but little detail. Jim Defede's brilliant portrayal of the people of this place masterfully focuses attention on the small detail of those rich souls who give Gander and its surrounding towns their meaning and weight. He does so simply and in plain tones, never overburdening the reader with overwrought rhetorical distractions, but telling the story and revealing the characters plainly. In so doing he captures the essence of their heroism --good people rising fully to the enormous challenge of this historic occasion."
4,Newfoundland the Land of Milk and Honey,I anticipated that this book would be about the typical reactions people experience during a crisis. I read the book from a disaster planner's perspective as I was interested how people react after a disaster. The entire book proves again that a crisis brings out the best in people. The people of Newfoundland extended their hospitality more than I would have anticipated. Having visited the island and traveled from Argentia to St. Anthony to Port Aux Basques Newfoundland is a paradise. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in how a community reacts to the challenge of a crisis.
4,Heartwarming,This book restored my faith in humanity. I got sucked in to the stories of each of the characters and found my emotions to follow what they were going through. This book was a quick read and made me hope that someday I am able to visit Gander.
5,Heartwarming,"A wonderful book, a quick read, full of touching stories of human compassion during a terrible time. The people of Gander went above and beyond to help the nearly 10,000 people who suddenly were dumped on them on that awful day. You will be blessed by the human kindness they showed in every chapter"
5,A charming tale of compassion and kindness,"In ""The Day the World Came to Town"" Jim Defede explores the fate of airline passengers who were diverted to Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11/2001 and of the Newfoundlanders who opened their hearts and home.If you're looking for a book that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside then this is the one. It's a charming tale of compassion and kindness."
5,Druss the Legend,"Druss the Legend, the dark axman known as the Deathwalker, must join the warrior Talisman on a mission of blood and glory. Only the stolen Eyes of Alchazzar (mystic jewels of power) will save Druss's dying friend, then unite the Nadir tribes against the evil of the Gothir. Can he succeed against the odds???David Gemmell's at it again with Druss the legend. He has fantasy readers drooling for his work (myself included). This is a bumpy rollercoaster ride with a big twist at the end. Read This book."
2,Unfortunate,"I am a great fan of Kraftwerk and I decided that a cd of different versions couldnt be too bad. I was wrong, as this cd does cover kraftwerk songs, although they are so removed from the originals it isnt funny. You might say that covers arent meant to be an exact duplicate of the original song, but even as covers go, these are not worthy of a 'tribute.' Even if you weren't comparing this album to the Kraftwerk originals, the tracks still sound terrible.Id reccomend you give this one a miss, and simply stick with the Kraftwerk originals"
5,Incredible,This is truly rock and roll at it's best! The guitar in One Stromy Night is exceptional. It carried me away! I loved every song and would recommend this cd to anyone that appreciates really good rock and roll!
4,Great train set - fab customer service,We purchased this train set on sale for a steal right before Christmas and couldn't ask for more! It is a solid table and our two boys (ages 2 and 5) loved the train set and made for a great present! It took us less than an hour to put together and only problem we experienced was that one of the leg board was slightly cracked so we called KidKraft for a replacement. Getting through to customer service and speaking to someone directly was quick and simple and they were very easy to deal with and helpful and we received the replacement part within a week. I would have to say that the KidKraft customer service team has been one of the best I've had to deal with in recent years and would definitely purchase again from this company based on the service received. We also have the KidKraft table set and it is a well-made set and have never had any problems with it (we've had it for three years). This was a good buy and we would recommend.
5,Great for preschoolers,"Purchased for grandchildren, 2 and 4. Easy to assemble. They love it!!!! Very surprised and pleased with quality and storage bins provided are perfect for extra supplies!!"
3,"Great table, train set leaves something to be desired.","We really like this table. The train portion of the table has a good picture. You can flip the boards to plain wood--we've done that to convert to a lego/art table. The drawers underneath, when full of trains etc., are too heavy for the slats and will fall. Then again, we have a lot of train track. The track and trains/toys that come with this set were not up to par. The mountain is cheap and some real Thomas trains have trouble going through. Our airport didn't come with screws (and I'm sure KidKraft would have sent new ones, but we didn't take the time). The bridge, gas station, helicopter, and crane broke within six months. We didn't mind too much since we had other stuff to replace it with, but if this were my only set, I would have been disappointed. The trains were really cheap.So, the table/is still great. The track works. We like it overall, but then there's all that other stuff to consider."
3,"Arrived broken, but survived","The box was badly damaged when the toy arrived. A rough drop broke one of the side panels exposing the particle board. It was so near Christmas we didn't want to send it back. We placed rubber baby safety strips over the exposed parts and then did the other side to make them match. It looks fine, I was just disappointed in how the toy was shipped. My almost 3 year old had really enjoyed playing with it. The tracks and other accessories that come with it are great."
5,I have a 3 year old and he loves it.,"I have a 3 year old and he loves it.. Some assembly required but not difficult, nice extra pieces came with it."
3,Needs more illustration,"First let me say, I never write reviews for anything; but this product has frustrated me so much that I had to say something. Putting this together on Christmas Eve was awful! There were no good pictures to help you through putting the track together and we found two errors in the instructions. Putting the table together was a breeze, it was just the track that is so complicating. Also, from what I can tell in just the few minutes that we have had it together; the train is no good. It derails all the time and I am sure that my little guy is going to get frustrated with it pretty quickly; I hope I am wrong. I will post more after a bit more use....just had to say something about the track itself."
2,Not that great...,"Our daughter received this set for her birthday. There are several small pieces that are a nightmare to assemble, that really could have come assembled to start with. The cars and trucks drive better on the train tracks than the actual train cars, the cargo boxes do not stay on the train cars very well, the buildings (aside from the one 3-D one) are just thin squares that you just stand up, so they knock over with any movement of the table, in reality, all of the accessories do. I know this is a cheaper set, but I'm sure some of the more expensive ones are of better quality. You really can't even push the train through the tunnel under the waterfall, and my kid is two... So I couldn't imagine other children being able to."
4,"Great, just a few flaws.","Overall, I love this and my son has played with it for hours! My only complaint is that some of the accessories are very flimsy/poor quality and one of them has already fallen apart several times. Still worth it if you can get a good price on it though!"
5,High Quality Train Set,"We bought this train set for our kids for Christmas and they both love it! The height of the table is good (about 16-18 inches) and the set comes with a ton of pieces (train cars, stop signs, bushes, etc). I feel like it took me just as long to put together the actual train tracks and the small helicopter pad and crane as it did to put together the actual table (about 90 mins or so for each --- though mind you I'm not terribly handy). The storage bins underneath get caught up a little bit when you try to slide them out but overall they are useful to have.We also purchased a Thomas and Percy car separately and they both work nicely on the tracks.While this set seemed a little pricier than some of the others we came across, the quality seems to be very good. The trains seem to roll very easily on the tracks and the kids are having a great time! Overall, I would highly recommend this train set!"
4,Great train table...unless your kid likes to eat paper/wood/cardboard....,"Our son absolutely LOVES this train table. It's well made, the storage bins under the table make for easy clean-up, and it is so cute. But, if your child is like ours and is in a paper eating phase you might want to hold off. The picture on the table itself easily comes off if your little one spills water or a sippy cup is set down and condensation occurs. Once there is lifting of the paper, your little one will NOT be able to resist ripping it all off. I have yet to contact Kidkraft and find out if we can purchase a replacement tabletop to set on the train table itself but I'm hoping they do. Will wait for the paper eating phase to be over though! All in all, this train table gets 4 stars. I only took one away because of the durability of the tabletop itself."
4,Gets played with every day,I purchased this train set for my 2 yr. old grandson since he is a big train fanatic. He just loves this table and he's just the right size to walk around it and push the trains over the tracks.He plays with it every day. I have since bought him several more trains and a train washing station to add to the table. Sometimes the trains don't magnatize together very well which allows the trains to come apart when he's pushing them around the track. I noticed that the trains that came with the table don't have as strong of a magnet as the ones I purchased separately. Sometimes the wooden tracks will come apart to easily or become uneven. Seems to be sturdy and loads of fun for him. Even my 5 yr. old granddaughter will play it with him on occasion.
4,My son loves it!,"I got this for my son's 3 yr b-day. He loves it. It wasnt too difficult to put together. The hard part was putting the track together to utilize as many peices as possible. I really like the bins underneath to hold extra peices/parts. My personal oppinion is that the little people, stop signs, trees, etc are not necessary. They just clog up the table and fall down if your arm accidentally hits them while pushing the train along the tracks....but they are not permanent so they just go to the bins under the table. Overall, this was a great buy and something that my kids can enjoy many years into the future since the tabletop flips over for general playing purposes."
2,fair towards midland,"This book is typical of its genre. It relies heavily on Snorre Sturlusson's ""Prose Edda"", which is one of the clearest sources on Nordic Mythology, it must also be kept in mind that Snorre was writing several hundred years post Heathen and was also highly influenced by classical forms of Mythological models. In short, Snorre's work reads like Greek myth with Nordic characters. Not to mention that he was not writing a handbook on Heathen belief, he was writing a handbook on poetry, particularly skaldic metric form and added the myth parts for reference. Snorre's work is useful as a secondary reference at best, and if Snorre got it wrong, and a book (this one) is based on Snorres works.... well... you get the picture."
4,Burn to the Roots,The concept of this album was to combine Sanders' transcendant T-sax wailing over funk riddims and brilliant African drumming. Bernie Worrell of Parliament fame plays keys and the kora player add some sweetness into the mix and I really dig the vocalizing but somehow the operation does'nt cohere. I think no one can bring the sound from a sax that Sanders can so I still got love for him.
5,"Superb, passionate, and warm","For those who have been waiting for a recording that reiterates the almost mystical emotional power that has typified Pharoah Sanders' work through much of his life, here it is. Welcome home!"
2,A bit dull.,"""Message From Home"" was the first of (so far) three albums by Pharoah Sanders produced by Bill Laswell and the first album by Sanders in quite a long time (I think since the '70s) to consist of all originals. It is not, unfortunately, very good.The album consists largely of synthesizer driven mid-tempo grooves well informed with percussion washes and fiery playing from Sanders. At its best, it proves pleasant enough (vocal chant-and-flute piece ""Kumba""), at worst it finds Sanders in drastic opposition to the music (ballad ""Nozipho"" finds Sanders overblowing and screeching against a soporific backdrop). It's not unlistenable, but its not the kind of record you'll be reaching for.Sanders and Laswell would succeed much more on their future efforts, this one is really pretty far from essential."
4,Great basics and wonderful menus,"There's a section at the front of the book that explains most of the ingredients - where to buy, how to store and use - great for people who are a little shy about using new ingredients. It's a good book for beginners or people who are experimenting with adding more vegetarian options to their diet. There is a section on planning meals at the back that lets you put together a menu of complementary items and makes it easy to ensure good and balanced nutrition.Directions are clear and interesting information is given about food and its uses, as well as easy-to-follow instructions for creating some kitchen basics so you don't have to succumb to store-bought preparations.Only criticism is, I wish it was spiral bound or had one of those lay-flat bindings to keep it open on the countertop.Highly recommended."
2,Don't bother,"I made three recipes in this book before giving up in frustration. If the flavors weren't uninteresting and one-dimensional, the technique described was a failure. I much prefer Deborah Madison's books, as well as Molly Katzen's."
2,"Good light, lousy mounting bracket","This light LOOKED like it would be very effective at night. However, I never got the chance to try it out in the dark. I mounted it to the bracket on my recently-purchased Topeak MTX E-Type rear luggage rack exactly according to the directions. The light was securely fastened -- or at least as much as the mounting bracket allowed. On my first ride with the light attached, it somehow got shaken loose and fell off at some point in this short, just under 10 mile commute."
3,"it's ok, but...","i can't say too much for it's water resistance.. i was doing a 30mi ride in a very light drizzle, and by the time i got home, i realised that the light was on, and it could not be switched off. taking it apart, i noticed that the batteries were a little wet from the road spray.i think my light is gone.."
5,Bike light,"One of the guys in our ride group had this light. He loves it and I share the same sentiment. I was using clip on blinking lights but they kept bouncing off and breaking. This light is bright, has great blinking options, is easy to put on and stays on. I turn it on when I'm out on a morning ride or if it's getting dark in the evening. Great light for the price."
3,It's OK,"This is a nice compact and bright flasher. However, my problem is that the plastic rails on the light body that slide onto the mounting bracket broke not too long after I bought it. I still use it, but I wedge it into the back of my helmet."
1,Save your money...,"I would not recommend this light to anyone who values their time and money. Your time - because you will waste some looking for a new light in a matter of months. Your money - because even if you do not break it you will be buying expensive batteries to keep it running. Not water proof or resistant - I live in Monterey, California and we do not get much rain out here, nor do I like to ride in the rain. That said this light was ruined by what little water it came in contact with or by the process of changing out the rusted batteries for new ones. Whichever the cause...it is a testament to quality and/or durability. Bottom line is this light is cheaply made! I am now looking for a light that uses a more common/cheaper battery (like AA or AAA) and that is actually water resistant!"
4,Great Buy,"Great product for price paid, I love the compact size, and the methods for attaching the light are great, L.E.D.'s are very bright, Product feels very durable, and to top it off the products water resistance is great if you plan ride in the rain. The only disappointment was the lack of presets (all it can do is Blink and be constantly on)"
5,A Bitter sweet goodbye,"Ok so the songs are in a differnt track listing then the Jubilation album. No lyrics or no telling you who's palying on what. You got to listen to it as a goodbye thanks for the memories and thank you album. ""High Cotton"" by Danko is a great song to lsiten on you're porch with a glass of lemonade. ""Book Faded Brown"" by Paul Jost and sand wonderfully By Danko is a song no one will ever forget. John Hiatt's ""Bound by Love"" is great if you're alone at least you'll be taken care by some one who will always tenderly love you that's why you stay. It's the last time will ever be able to hearRick Danko singing his heart out with the Band and Levon's crispy voice that of a man who has seen it all. ""French Girls"" Is a short but sweet Goodbye. We can reflect on the joy they brought us but really never asked for anything in return for 30 years."
3,YYYYYAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN,"BORING... very dry material, but does good job of explaining the subject while providing a great replacement for ambien."
2,Book Critic2,I was a little dissapointed with this purchase because it claims to be hardcover but in actuality it is three ring punched and individual pages. It is complete and in very good condition though. I would still consider purchasing from this agent since the prices are very low.
3,perfect match,THis was the product that I wanted and I am happy to get the right purchase. My only complaint is that it took 2 weeks to get the book and i know it does not take that long to send anything. The timing delay was a little inconvenient because my class had been using the book while i was still waiting to receive it.
1,Horrible,"This book is horribly written, It does not provide enough detail or examples. It was not worth the purchase or the price."
1,Waste of paper,This textbook is wordy and never gives a direct explanation of how to do perform a concept which makes it difficult when trying to review or brush up on any fundamentals.
1,Terrible Book,"My university requires this book so students have a point of reference if needed but all instruction and homework is done via department made handouts for good reason. This book book is terribly written with poor examples and exercises. Sample statistics and data sets attempt to convey more than mathematical comprehension but it just plays out as long winded and excessive. Also on a personal note while I consider myself a far left liberal I find the tone of this book similar to a preachy hippy, keep the math pure and teach me the fundamentals I require. Avoid at all costs."
3,Good Study Tool,"I ordered this book for a college course. It turned out that I didn't really need it, but I read it over anyway before exams and it was easy to understand and was organized. It also came with a CD, but I never used it."
4,South Park is Awesome!!!,"This is a good DVD to buy. It starts out with ""Conjoined Fetus Lady"" which is pretty funny. I love the part where the Chinese people make fun of the americans. Overall its a pretty good episode.The Next Episode is ""The Mexican Staring frog of Southern Sri Lanka"". Its a very funny episode, especially when it goes back showing Jimbo and Ned in Vietnam. Overall its an OK episode.The Next episode is ""Flashbacks"". The first time i saw it i loved it, but the second time it wasnt as good. If you havent seen this episode before you have to see it, its hilarious!The next episode is ""Summer Sucks"". Its a funny episode but not the greatest.If you're a south park freak (like me) you should definitely buy this one. But, there are others that are better than it. But if you collect them, definitely get this one."
3,"Interesting, fun, but wasting space","I like several of the ideas; I thought hockey would be good, but it is pong.The robot and web browser are very interesting ideas. You can really think of things to do with these.The ideas and examples would have given this book a higher rating but there were a couple problems that I list below.Bad ideas of the writer; first is listing the main functions for class. First the method names and parameters and return types doesn't really help. It just took up space.Second bad thing is the way code is shown in the book, here are pieces of the code, now filling in other pieces, and just continuing along those lines. I would prefer the entire program and list the line numbers, in writing just identify the line numbers.I think every chapter would be about a fifth the size if the code didn't extend so long and the class methods were delete."
3,Seems to code projects using old obsolete Java,"Some of the projects use old obsolete AWT extensively. Hello - Java Swing is the way to do GUI's. Since JDK 1.4 in 2002 reading images is best done with ImageIO.read(..) not using the old AWT media tracker. The html examples use capitals, e.g. BODY not the current approved xhtml body tag. I can't put in the angle brackets since it confuses the browser."
2,Not so great,"This book isn't as fun to read as it might tell you. I try to work on a project and end up getting confused as to which class I'm working on, or where everything fits together. It isn't easy to follow and it just glides through things nonchalantly, but doesn't bother to give a finished product that I can find.I tried the beginners fish aquarium class, but couldn't get too far because of formatting. Tried the slapshot game and got lost as to which class was which and which code went where. It's great if you want something to sit on your shelf and look pretty, maybe for moderate reference, but not practical or easy enough to read. And this is coming from someone who has read many types of these books in the past."
2,"A word of warning to ""jazz"" fans","This album has British saxophonist Courtney Pine really coasting - smooth & mellow with a predominance of synthesisers & drum programming with no real ""blowing"" or hard edges. Very, very reminiscent of Kenny G with some synthesised reggae inflections & also some rather schmaltzy vocal work. If you like that sort of thing, fine, but in my humble opinion ""smooth"" jazz like this just isn't worth the time or money, given the abundance of truly high quality, inventive jazz available."
5,Excellent,This is an excellent book that will give the reader a basic insight into the major topics of psychology. I would recommend this book for Christian leaders to read because it provides a Christian perspective on pyschological findings that would contribute to ones counselling proficiency.
2,Professional review,"This is a very rudimentary book, with some outdated and unsubstantiated research. It also is weak in explaining some theoretical models."
3,Fair for both Almodovar and Sakamoto,"Liked the film. ALmodovar was experimenting with styled-up Douglas Sirk melodrama, and Marisa Paredes is always great to watch. The score served the film well, but becomes a bit redundant on record. One main theme gets played over and over in many treatments long and short. It's a sad, mournful piece, quite pretty, but I wish Sakamoto had developed some additional themes for the other characters. The pop cuts by Spanish singers are great, especially ""Un Ano de Amor"" which had Miguel Bose in drag in the film singing a 60s-styled love-anthem that is quite catchy . Not Almodovar's best film by a long shot, though, and certainly not Sakamoto's best outing as a film composer."
1,Beware of Spyware,"While I enjoyed the expansion pack, this software and the two mech packs (clan arsenal and innersphere) contain the C-Dilla spyware. This is a copywrite protection program that installs on your machine and does not shut down after you exit the game. TurboTax also installs the program and the only way to remove it is to download and run the safecast uninstaller program from the intuit website. Including this program was a terrible thing for Microsoft to do, especially since it does not disclose the fact at any time."
5,Great Addition to an already great game!!!,"Loved MW IV. Black Night is a great addition with new mechs, new weapons, and new missions. Buy it!!!"
2,"Mags, Angel, Shredder...!!! HEEELLLLPPP !!!!!","Okay, there's nothing wrong with a challenge. But I'm just selfish and unsporting enough that I don't want a tie when I lock up with the enemy-- I want to bring enough force to bear on them to overwhelm them. And that is the weakness of Black Knight-- mission after mission. You can't. On most of the missions, you ought to have two lances or more, but you will have to cross your fingers and try to beat the four to one odds with your one lance and on again, off again lancemates. Perhaps Mechwarrior: Mercenaries spoiled me badly, but I was too busy cursing like a werewolf for most of the missions in Black Knight at the lousy odds and even worse mission profiles to enjoy any of it. Now, if they had let me import my gear and lances from Mercenaries to this one.... that would have been different. To #@%%% with the Legion, Spectre Lance rules."
5,Why should MechWarrior fans get this game.,"I am a big MechWarrior fan.I have #3,4.Not #4 Black Knight.They are really fun games to play.I like it because it is challenging and it is fun.I build Mechs with legos.I am trying to find where I can get little models of any Mechs.Some of the games are a little cheap.Otherwise they are all sweet games.I have played all of them, but I only have these two. I am going to get this one for my birthday.If any kids who like robots blowing up other robots.Then they should get this game."
4,A great game,"To start off I feel any person who likes to play fighting for technique and style should buy this game, but the game has a few issues(at least with me). The way to select your customized character is annoying. the game is missing items available in japan. other than that I can't see nothing wrong. do not expect it to be tekken6 or dead or alive 4. I am a big fan of the Virtua Fighter series but I am getting spoiled by other games and I would like to see features available in other fighting games in this one. for less than $20 you are not going to get a better quality game. virtua fighter is the original 3d fighting game."
2,Eh...,"It's okay. It has beautiful graphics and everything LOOKS incredible. The only thing that made me give it 2 stars was the originality, these characters aren't that original and to be honest, I think DOA4 is better than this. I'm not saying this is horrible either. If you're into realistic stuff, then this would be a game for you."
4,Best Picture Hanger I have used,"Very easy to use, and the wall dog anchors are quite strong. A must buy if you want level hanging and/or reassuring strength."
4,Good info!,"This is very informative, but dry. Many already know that Dr. Walter Martin was a leader on Cults. This documentary only serves as a reminder. The information is solid, but the delivery is dry."
1,preferred by Jehovah's Witnesses,"As indicated on wikipedia.org and many other sources, the 1901/1929 ASV was the version used by the Jehovah's Witnesses sect until they developed their own version which is a revision of the ASV. They continue to be the source for most of the ASV copies distributed today and support it due to its extensive use of the word ""Jehovah"" and its placement of many of the verses it finds problematic in the margin or footnotes rather than in the main text."
4,"Great Bible, but there's a less expenseive version","It is always nice to have several versions of the Bible. Each translation gives you a different perspective. Why only 4-stars? I prefer the ESV and the Message.I noticed that this is described as the ""ONLY ASV"" actually it is not -- there is a new paperbackThe Holy Bible American Standard Versionfor $29.99. The two 1-star reviews for this are for the Kindle edition, but a different publisher.Be sure NOT to buy the Kindle version!"
4,Cute and Easy!,"Durable, easy to slip on for baby, and cute! Yellow always brightens up any room and having the ducky for the baby to play with makes him or her even happier."
1,COULD BE BETTER,"ONLY EPISODES OF 1999- I CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH FAN BUT DVD IS NOT The REASON SO THAT I LIKE The SHOW I ANOTHER THING SO THAT THEY CANCELLED The SHOW IF HIM GO SO WELL THEY COULD HAVE HAD IMPRESSIVE BATTLES LIKE:Ashton Kutcher vs Jack BlackNAOMI WATTSON vs Rene ZELLWEGERJASON LEE vs JUDE LAW""BUT NOOO THE SHOW IS CANCELED""THIS DVD IS VERY POOR NONCSINGLE PROBALY IS EAST DVD OF CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH THAT MANAGES TO REMOVELIKE RELESED ALL THE SERIES."
2,"Too Little, Too Late","Celebrity Death Match is a wonderfully sick masterpiece. This DVD, however, isn't worth buying. It's only 45 minutes long and [is costly]. Why doesn't Sony release a Celebrity Death Match DVD set of the entire series?"
1,Old days,Thought it would be funny.. Liked it as a teenager.. Not so much as an adult just more graphic than i remebered
1,the biggest rip off ever and i didn't see this dvd,im hearing from other reviewers that this is only 45 minutes long. i like celebrity deathmatch but not this. what they should do is release the entire series. thats what they really should do.
1,??????,HOW is one supposed to compare/contrast this item with competitors WITHOUT EVEN SEEING IT? - don't list a product until you can post a picture/series of pictures with that listing!
2,Ow!,"These shoes look cute and got good review, so I decided to give them a try. Even though I ordered a half-size larger than I normally wear, they hurt so much when I tried them on that I never even wore them out of the house. I returned them and am planning to buy a pair of Dansko wedges.I should mention that I have very attractive feet - big, flat, and square (like Fred Flintstone) - that only respond well to orthopedic-looking shoes. If your feet are of a daintier variety, these might be fine."
2,Print version has no industry information like the older version. Not worth subscribing if you are in the industry.,"Years ago, the Hollywood Reporter print subscription had everything any pro or aspiring pro in the movie business needed to know. The current print version is more for movie fans than the industry trade it used to be. You must subscribe to the digital online version to get the industry information instead of the print version now."
2,Heads Up...,"Anyone interested in purchasing this import single at the import price should be advised that this 8+ minute version appears on John's CD The Complete Thom Bell Sessions, as does ""Three Way Love Affair"". I already had this CD in my library but was not aware of its inclusion before making this purchase. For $9.98 you can own an entire album, compared to the $11.99 import price of this CD-Single. This song isn't even one of his best. However, The Complete... also includes ""Mama Can't Buy You Love, which make that CD's purchase worth the ten bucks."
2,WHY....GOD WHY???,"I can't believe that this song came on the top of the list and his great ""Original Sin"" single from 2002 didn't even reach top 20. This song isn't disaster, but it is one of his weakest and it isn't even Elton's composition. If you wanna this song, buy then ""Complete Thom Bell Sessions"" album. There is also ""Three way Love Affair"" on it.This is sweet repetitive disco song with too much sugar on it. Not disaster, but certanly not one of his best at all."
1,Watered Down!,"You should be ashamed selling this crapola.I will never buy from this vendor again. I have purchasedplenty of fragrances from Amazon and ebay. This producthas been tampered with, I can literally see that thebottle was opened because there are little pry marks on the bottom.The scent literally wears off by the time you get out the door.Amazon should give you the boot!"
1,I don't think it's an original product,I had a small amount of cologne left in a bottle of Emporio Armani which I purchased at Macy's a while back. I compared the smell of the Macy's bottle and the one I received from Amazon. The bottle from Amazon is not nearly as strong as the bottle purchased at Macy's. I'm wondering if I received a counterfeited bottle. Won't be purchasing this bottle again from Amazon.
2,"Great cologne, bad sample","I've bought this cologne before and really liked it, but the most recent sample I bought from the Perfume Emporium smelled like some cheap no name brand. I don't no if my sample was an old bottle that was past it's shelf life or it was watered down, it may have been in the right container but it wasn't the same cologne."
2,"Safe smell, crappy bottle","I would say this is a safe smell, enjoyable, clean and not overwhelming. I found it generic, many other fragances smell alike. In my opinion projection is low, as well as duration. I get 4-5 hours on my skin. Good for work I would say, unoffensive.The bottle is poorly made, the sprayer started failing and the liquid started to leak. I had to change the bottle in less than a week. Since the bottle has this strange design it's not possible to know where the failure is."
2,Emporio Armani,I have been looking all over for this product. I was a little disappointed on paying so much for so little.
1,"DO Not Buy, Do Not Buy","I read a lot of negative reviews about the purchase of high end, expensive perfumes at Amazon Website; however, since this one was being sold by amazon.com itself, I decided to take a risk. I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The fragrance is so subtle that even a person standing one foot away cannot appreciate it------------and that is immediately after putting it on! Complete waste of money."
3,Smells good but...,"This cologne smells great don't get me wrong. However, when I took it out of the box it felt half full. I'm not sure if it's because of the design of the container or what but for $50 there are other colognes out there that smell just as good, provide you with more quantity and are less expensive. Shop around before you make a decision."
4,Maybe the best ever,"While Kim Simmons has probably played with everybody who can play an instrument, this is clearly one of his best CD's ever. Every song is worth listening to. With some airplay this would be a big seller for the band."
3,"Wow What a Tire! Comfort, Speed, Lightweight...Not Durable!","I bought a pair of Open Corsas and they were heaven for 200 miles, then the rear picked up a small shard, it looked like a small flake from the aggregate in asphalt.After two more rides, the split in the tread deepened and the tire blew out.I conclude these would be 5 star racing tires, but I'm not a racer and don't like their lack of durability. The ride they give is awesome, they corner like a dream and stick to the pavement. I just won't buy them again (sigh).One more thing; don't let them sit in a car during summer with full pressure. Both blew the tubes. Let out about 30 pounds."
3,A love/hate relationship.,"Combined with Michelin Latex tubes, this tire effectively diffuses road vibrations to a mere, slight tremor, while navigating the roughest of roads. On flats, they roll so fast and smooth...it feels exactly like gliding on marble, at 80psi. The turning confidence, high-speed ease and sheer downhill velocity you can achieve will drop your jaws in utter disbelief. However, these tires' sublime rolling resistance and dreamy ride quality will all soon come to a rude, abrupt end, as you experience the inevitable, true-life reality of absolutely ZERO FLAT PROTECTION.I only bought them to see what all the hype was about, and simply because you only live ONCE. When these tires are done...I won't be buying them TWICE. I'll go back to the Schwalbe Ultremo R.1 - which is lighter, and is about 90% close to the CX...but with far superior durability and puncture resistance."
4,History Comes to Life,"I never really knew the president until I read the book. It provided insight and valuable understanding into the development of his ideals and lifelong commitment to community. Every night as I tucked my three darling sons into bed, we would cast aside Harry Potter for Hour Before Daylight. What a wonderful way to share our history with the family."
4,Not Politics,"Absorbing book about life in the South during the Depression era--including good relationships among blacks and whites who lived in farming communities. The work ethic was admirable and most people in the Carter family seemed to be happy, with little complaining. Jimmy Carter as a child during this time, learned many lessons which helped when he entered into the political arena."
4,Ever spend a summer barefoot?,"If you did, this book is a must. I downloaded the President reading his book from Audible.com to play on my MP3 player. It's like having him drive along with you and recount his adventures. You won't be disapointed in getting this special insight into a very decent man (and I voted for both Ford and Reagan)."
1,Jimmy Carter is no Rick Bragg,I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book being a great fan of all Southern writings and writers. I especially enjoyed the wonderful It's All Over But the Shoutin' by Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Bragg.Let me say I have always admired Jimmy Carter; he seems a man of virtue and honor. Unfortunately he can't write and someone should have told him. I found the book repetitive and monotonous and in need of an editor with the best organizational skills. Carter jumped from one subject to another continously without any hint of where he may be going.
4,Informative and Interesting,"I groaned when my Lit. Professor assigned this, but ended up truly enjoying it. Jimmy Carter's ""voice"" is a little dry at times, but still, his experiences are very engaging. I was touched by his past and by the kindess within his heart. Recommend even for recreational reading."
2,"I like Cater, but can't cotton his writing","Why is it that ex-presidents make poor writers? Is it that they have had to hide their feeing so long they are afraid to loosen up afterward because we might think less of them? I was looking forward to reading about a boy growing up in Georgia while I was growing up in Iowa, but his writing is so stiff and lifeless that I quit halfway through."
5,A Joy to Read,"Not since I read (on April 11, 1986) Russell Baker's Pulitzer-prize-winning Growing Up has there been a book of this genre which has so moved me. I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia. This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia. I hope it wins this year's (or next year's)Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as Russell Baker's delightful book did in 1983."
3,Outdated but has value as time capsule,"I bought this because it has brief treatments of combinatory logic and the lambda calculus. I was dissapointed, however, because of the rather idiosyncratic notation; I had to go back and start nearly from the beginning to see how he was developing his formal systems. I've had logic, so I felt that it was inconvenient to have to read chapters just to get a handle on his notation and outlook. When I did finally arive at the sections on combinators and lambda, the treatment was too superficial to be a benefit. Should've just bought Hindley.The problems stated, I found the author's discussion of early research informative and interesting. This book was written before an interpretation was formally defined in Tarski (1956), so the different research directions to escape this problem I thought were neat. There is much discussion about purely syntactical systems vs. systems where semantics are defined."
3,"Good, not great","I bought the Mick Harvey CD after hearing ""Out of Time"" at the end of a Breaking Bad episode. Out of time is a solid tune and I would say there are about four other solid tunes on the CD, but there are a number of throw aways. It's worth getting for the gems, but this is not a CD that I'm raving about."
3,Good Idea Generator,"I've read some of Lee Frost's other books, and really have enjoyed them. This book is probably best suited to the casual photographer who's wants to try a few things, but doesn't want to seriously pursue technique. At least, that's my best guess, judging from the format and subject coverage.I can't say it's my favorite photography book. Other options would be Frost's excellent book on low light photography, or the National Geographic Field Guide series."
2,frustrating for the DSLR photographer,"I'm sure this was a great book, 8 years ago (i'd give it 4 stars then), but it's taken me forever to get through the book when every other technique is a film-specific technique like ""duplicating slides"", ""pushing film, or ""cross-processing"", or is referring to specific cameras, film types, etc to get desired results. most of this can be done in photoshop with one dslr and a couple lenses.thankfully, i just saw that Frost has released a new version of this book specific to digital photography. i probably wouldn't buy it though. i hope i can sell this used."
2,DeLonghi,Horrible... coffee doesn't taste that great... especially for the price... mine broke after 2 months... the lid of the carafe just snapped off... so the coffee won't drip into the pot
3,"some useful information, too expensive","The learning flash 4 tape lasts around 7 hours, the beginning of the tapes describe whats in the manuals, tweening, symbols, etc. If you learn faster by watching then it will probably help. The aspect of the tape that bothers me is that Lynda will describe a technique, say motion tweening, then David will explain how thats changed in V 4.0 and then show you how to do it faster. Why not just show us the 4.0 way and stop wasting time with 3.0 methods. Nice coverage of tell target, bandwidth profiler, and a good example of preloading methods. IMHO the tape would be better if it explained in detail the newest features, and left the intro stuff to the manual and the other Flash books out there. It would have been nice to include an index so you can fast forward to the topics you want to see, also the audio quality on the tapes is horrible. Too bad Freehand 9.0 wasn't out when the tape was made since coverage of that would have added another star to the review."
2,Long-winded,"Perhaps 100 years ago, readers considered this to be a great book. However, today, the average reader will find it to be long-winded. The introduction is actually the first 5 chapters, at least. I gave up after chapter 5."
1,JR in San Diego,"While it's cool to have Donal Trump cologne in your bathroom for people to see, don't wear it because it sucks. Kinda smells like Windex with a little Pine Sol added. But hey, that's not why you bought it really."
1,Pass on it,My baby didn't get much use out of these. They're sort of too small to care. I would pass on this item next time.
3,Disappointing,"These are cute and a great idea but the rattles are SO quiet, you have to shake them really, really hard to hear them, I'm not sure my baby even realises she's wearing them unless she gets her hands where she can see them. They really don't make much noise at all with a young baby's uncoordinated hand movements. Even at 3 months my daughter's main amusement from them is chewing the duck's beak."
2,From Back Cover,"Tucker Hale: Black Sheep. Bush pilot. Scarred--both inside and out. Never stays in one place too long.Harley Sayers: Named after a motorcycle--the only unconventional thing about her. Sweet. Sexy. Vulnerable.Returning home to make peace with the old man was a painful experience for Tucker. Especially when house- sitter Harley ""welcomed"" him, baseball bat in hand! They were forced to share the place until his absent father returned--which meant playing by Harley's rules. No smoking. Moderate exercise for his damaged leg. And no sleeping with the help...But the rules didn't cover what would happen if Harley fell in love..."
2,funny but broken,"This was the funniest thing at Halloween,but it was also broken.It lasted one day before it dropped out of his mouth and a whole 20 inches to the ground and snapped a piece off.I would not buy again."
3,it was good,"i bought this as a gift, it wasn't like what i saw in the picture, the color was very darker than it is in the picture,and the model was a bit different,the shipping time was good,at end i recommend it coz it's nice anyway."
3,"Cute idea, not practical","We bought this pacifier to go with my baby's first Halloween costume. He was a bat, so we added the paci to make him a vampire bat. It's cute, but very heavy. It has the same nipple as a Nuk brand pacifier. Also, it is not purple like the picture shows. The lips and tongue are red. I wish it really was purple since my baby's costume was black and purple."
3,HUGE,"I love the concept of this. I wish it had been a little smaller...my daughter was 6m old when I'd tried to give this to her and she wouldn't keep it in her mouth. This halloween, at 18m, she probably would have been able to use it, but hasn't used a binky in many months."
5,an objective pinnacle of human expression,"stan recorded this session with months left to live in a staggering carear of music making . to be joined on these absolutely transcendent tracks by his frequent collaborator and brother in all but birth , kenny barron , is a gift to all with the capacity to appreciate it ."
4,Sean Young *is* the Fitzgerald Girl,"Sean Young is perfectly cast as an F. Scott Fitgerald heroine in this good PBS adaptation of one of his short stories. She captures the brittle charm, beauty, and underlying vulnerability of the Jazz Age girls he wrote about. She would have made a great Daisy Buchanan. This isn't one of Fitzgerald's best stories, but it very much captures his distinctive style, mood, and favorite subjects--money, fashion, and their ephemeral power."
2,"Rent, don't buy","An OK movie, was she looking for a husband or just a party girl? I expected more from Sean Young."
5,EXCELLENT!,These are very good & super fresh. Highly recommended for any & all nut lovers. The salty & sweet plus the perfect crunch make these hard to beat.
5,So good they're dangerous!,"Man, you could just sit there behind a computer and much away a whole tin of these over the course of a few hours, and that's a lot of fat! So, these are so good I'd say that if you're trying to lose weight I'd stay away unless your doing about 5 miles a day on a treadmill, and then you'd still better have some discipline and just put...the...tin...away after a while. Man these are good!"
3,Something to watch on a rainy day,"Its an ok movie to watch and Demi Moore looks great as a blonde, however the accent she uses is like nails on a chalkboard. That expensive dye job was in the budget, but couldn't they afford to hire a dialect coach?"
3,Movie,It's a good movie it wsen't dull had some cute parts in it.It's better then some shows i have seen.
1,The Butcher's Wife,I brought this DVD from Amazon and could never watch it because it says it's incompatable with my DVD player....DVD was made in Mexico.
3,The psychiatrist meets the psychic,"Some people seem to like this kind of mindless movie.The best thing in the movie for me was the blues singing ofMary Steenburgen. I didn't find the idea of science meeting pseudo-psi very funny. But it is a romantic comedy and they usually make even less sense than this one where the psychic marries the wrong guy. The acting of Demi Moore is really pretty bad, but Jeff Daniels is just not much better."
4,Feel Good Movie,A fairytale story where mismatched people find their way to their proper mates at the end. A feel good movie that leaves you smiling and there's nothing wrong with that. Excellent performances by everyone.
4,I love this movie (except for Jeff Daniels),"If you like Mermaids or Joe vs. the Volcano, you'll like this, too. Charming, moving, and magical from start to finish. The only fault I find is that Daniels is not particularly charismatic as the leading man, but Demi (with fabulous hair), Mary Steenburgen, and the rest of the cast really shine. Check it out!"
4,Very funny,"This is not a very credible love story but a very funny one between Demi Moore (the fey butcher's wife) and Jeff Daniels (the hard-nosed shrink).If you believe in ""Once upon a time..."", you can buy it."
3,Very Good Movie!,Daryl Hannah could have done a better job in the lead role! Would have been 5 stars with Daryl Hannah. I love Saryl hannah!
2,Bad as three-day-old ground chuck...,"Five minutes into The Butcher's Wife, my thought was, ""The has got to be a vanity project."" It feels like Demi Moore's version of Eddie Murphy's Vampire In Brooklyn, a movie were a megastar is attached, everyone lets them do their own thing, and no one wants to tell them, look, this isn't working. The cast does try hard, but the inept script gives them nothing to work with. The DVD quality is mediocre at best. From the opening seconds of the film, the screen is crawling with grain, not made any better by the low video bitrate. Audio is passable, and the only extra is a laughably bad trailer. Fans of Demi Moore -- if there are any left after The Scarlet Letter or G.I. Jane -- may want to add this to their collection, but the other 6,185,348,023 of you in the world will want to give it a pass."
3,I must have missed something...,"I've read the reviews stating that this is a better DVD than ""Live In Boston,"" but really, it's not. I miss ""The Ox"" as much as any serious Who fan, but this DVD is cursed with incredibly poor cinematography (many bleached, washed-out, home movie ""camcorder""-like shots), more off-key notes from Townshend AND Daltrey than I care to remember, and far less fire and passion than can be found on the ""Boston"" set. This performance will fit nicely in the collectin of any Who completist, but to place it above the Live In Boston set is just...plain...WRONG."
3,I Hate Live Performances,"This show is a really good show. The audio mix really stinks though. But, from what I see, the group was on. However, I really hate live performances that are recorded for video. Camera shots are constantly changing. Sweeping shots from all over that change every 2-3 seconds. I guess it's supposed to give you that ""Concert Experience"" like you were there. I'll take the bootleg concerts where there are only 2 or 3 camera angles with bad audio anytime. That is why I've only watched Royal Albert Hall and Concert for NYC once each. Frankly, I don't really care who's in the crowd, because crowd shots prove that, once again, white people have no rhythm."
1,Complete CRAP!!!,"I'm not sure what went wrong with the production of this DVD, but whoever signed off on it as a ""professional, commercial product"" most certainly should be shot. Repeatedly. In the head.This DVD is unwatchable crap that looks like it was recorded using a cellphone camera. For example, anytime the camera points to the lights on stage, the video blows out, meaning that the band mates disappear into a blur of bright yellow. Of course, comparing this DVD's video quality to that of a cellphone's, is an insult to cellphones.It was mentioned in a previous review that this concert was for charity, so if you're feeling charitable and want to waste your money, go ahead and buy the DVD and use it for target practice (a la ""Success Story"") but if you're looking for a good Who concert DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"
1,this is not the WHO at there best,"why was this dvd of the who ever produced,it is terrible, i know the who did this session for charity but oh,why put the concert onto dvd its awfull, wait until the who produce a dvd of one of the concerts where they have had time to practise at least..dont buy if your a fan & if not dont be put off by this dvd"
3,"For true fans only,","Finally picked this up and gave it a go. Great to see the band stripped down, but I could see why they later added Simon Townshend for the extra harmonies which are sadly lacking here. The band's performance is uneven. Pete does save the day with the guitar switch in the middle of Pinball Wizard. John shines on My Wife. While Pete or Roger often screw up a lyric here or there, the most notable flub is the ending to Baba O'Riley. But my biggest complaint is the sound quality. For some reason this dvd is missing some of its ""punch"" and John's bass is almost nonexistant! The post-Moon Who have yet to be captured properly on dvd."
5,Exquisite music for the open mind,"Staircase is the finest album of ""in the studio"" piano improvisations that Jarrett ever recorded. Which is to say that these are some of the finest piano improvisations that you will ever hear. The audio fidelity captured by Tonstudio Bauer where this album was recorded is incredible. That said, it should be noted that this is challenging music. Some pieces are almost minimalist in their approach, and a number have no recognizable melody but really only ""texture."" Even so, this is some of the most original and remarkable piano improvisation ever captured on vinyl. For people who know Jarrett primarily through more popular albums such as the ""Köln Concerts,"" some of this music may seem a bit inaccessible. But if you listen with an open mind, you may have a profound musical experience..."
4,Great Moments,Keith Jarret gives us his usual varied range on this studio improvisation from the seventies. Hourglass is one of my favorite Jarret solos and is worth the price of admission alone. Other nice moments include Staircase Parts I and III.
2,Major Disappointment,"There is no way the regular price for this shirt should have EVER retailed for 25.00. It is a plain T-shirt made with cotton and polyester, Nothing special about this shirt. For 10.99 I could/should have gone to Ross, Sears, anywhere and bought 3 of the same type of shirts for 10.99. I have purchased Maxit products before and was pleased until now. I was enticed when I saw the regular retail and then the closeout price, assuming I was getting a deal. The regular retail for the shirt is 10.99 and should be sold for $3 or $4 max! Also, no where close to an Under Armour Shirt..."
4,Fascinating Aspects of Turner's Life,"Janet Lowe has fashioned a fine overview of Ted Turner's life and thoughts. Lowe's style offers effortless reading as the material flows eloquently throughout the book. Ted Turner Speaks is not your typical biography with details of every aspect on its subject; Lowe instead chooses to maintain brevity by focusing on the most fascinating aspects of Turner's life and the elements of his character that she believes to have been the most influential. If you are seeking to discover various captivating elements behind the life of this media titan, you will find this book worthwhile."
2,"I'm a huge fan of Mr. Shearing, but......","There have been few people to approach G. Shearing's talent for playing the piano. This record was no exception as his phrasing and arranging done ""internally"" on one instrument is typically impeccable. The selection of material is likewise very, very good. However, this recording was done at the private studio of Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer in 1974. While the equipment there might have been quite good for a private studio in 1974, the tape noise on the recording is so pronounced as to be a real distraction. Perhaps as an MP3 recording listened to in a car this would be an acceptable level of fidelity, but on a decent modern home system....no. This is the first Shearing recording I've ever regretted purchasing. That's the bad news. The good news is that there are numerous other examples of his talent out there in print and many of them sound absolutely wonderful, even for their age."
3,Okay for a brochure,This is just a brochure with little more than what is common knowledge about dyslexia.
4,pretty good,philip caveney specialises in writting fast paced thrillers with a dash of horror thrown in and this one is no exception. in manchester a series of murders are taking place. free lance photograhper danny weston stumbles across the body of man completly skinned in a railway tunnel and is forced to investiage the murders. the murders eventually turn out to something to do with the aztecs. caveney crafts some good set pieces and the finale is good. the book does not pretend to be anything which is it not: a well written compelling thriller. well worth seeking out
4,Orange you glad you'll buy these?,"Puns aside, these earrings are a great value, just the right size and the orange hue is beautiful. Count me a very satisfied customer."
4,Dangle Earrings,I really like these earrings. The only thing to note is that the orange bead looks really fake (like plastic).
1,earings,Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear....
1,Disappointing,"The text of this book is some eighty pages, which appear to be a very bare-bones summary of various theories of learning, often with charts inserted from other books, with very few examples or guidelines as to how one would actually implement any of those ideas. You really just get an academic summary of these ideas with virtually no context or elaboration. I would recommend you rather go directly to the work of the Israeli educationalist Feuerstein (see the book by Sharron and Coulter, Changing Children's Minds), and that of Stanley Greenspan (numerous books), which seem to be the key works reflected in this all-too-brief book"
2,Great book poor Kindle transfer.,"This is very significant treatise on first principles. However the Kindle version is irritatingly sloppy. Poor format, poor transfer, - at times only the context of the scrambled ""word"" will reveal the actual word Bradley wrote. I hope my friends at Amazon will redo this text and notify those of us who purchaed it that a faithful copy is now available."
2,It broke after a week!,I had originally written a review about this ring after I received it. It was a good review because I was happy at the time. HOWEVER I just had to edit my review because I have only had this ring exactly a week and one of the longest arms or w/e it is broke off!! And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time. I will not be purchasing anything else from this company. The only reason it is 2 stars is because I DID like the ring at first.
2,Dropped The Ball!,"This books began with all the bang and whistles of a great story. In fact, the story in its self is not to shabby, but every chapter following the first became increasingly predictable and when I gladly got to the end of the book the story had turned into the most cliched work of fiction I'd ever encountered. Someone please inform this storyteller about ""Spell Check,"" and all the other grammer tools available theses days. The 2nd and 3rd act dropped the ball completely. The reader is able to pick out the exact movie where every inspiration for acts 2 & 3 was borrowed. And badly borrowed at that! For all of us trying to find an Ethnic Storyteller to embrace; this storyteller is not ""The One!""I strongly suggest you look elsewhere.For example...""LaErtes, The King of Horra/Thrilla!"""
3,Peter learns that the inconvenience of Rain is worth all the good things God can do with rain.,"This is a Broadman Press , which was the old Southern Baptist Press and now Lifeway Books. The copy I have is a 1958 co. The words are easy so that it can be read by very early elementary aged children or to preschoolers.The story also presents a situation that a child of this age can relate to: namely not being able to play outside because of weather. Peter wakes up to find it raining . ""Old bad rain,"" he growls. He can't do any of the fun stuff when it rains. Mother sees he is frowning when he comes to breakfast and she inquires about this. ""I am sorry you do not like the rain. The rain helped you to have good juice."" The rest of the book tells what a blessing the rain really is because of what all God does with rain. In the end Peter is glad that it rains, even when he can not ride his tricycle."
3,A nostaligic Sunday school book,The cover makes it a nice nostalgic piece to include in a decor arrangement for a children's sunday school department. I hope you can find a sweet copy like I have.
2,Not what I expected,This wasn't for me. I really liked his Yoga at Home series and I couldn't even get through the first 20 minutes of this video. I like the om chants but the breathing and eye rolling was not for me. After 20 minutes we were still doing meditative postures. I'm a 40 yr old woman from the mid-west who works an average of 50 hours a week. I have always appreciated the spiritual and meditative pieces of yoga but this was too much. I do yoga to stretch after hours of standing on my feet. If I wanted to sit and meditate for 20 minutes and do intense chest breathing I would have bought a dvd on meditation. I would only recommend this for someone who is really interested in delving into traditional yoga and has a lot of time to spend doing it everyday.
4,exit series,"all of charlotte macleod's plot twists, wacky characters and wonderful command of the english language mixed into a really good story, in the course of which one of her most amusing, but annoying, characters gets her richly deserved comeuppance and a long under-rated character is revealed in his true colors. i'm sorry there won't be any more, this is a series i could have happily gone on reading for many more years. as it is, i'll have to settle for re-reading my charlotte macleod collection."
2,Why in the world isn't this thing letterboxed!?,"The movie itself gets at least four stars, but minus two for the studio for being so purblind as to issue it with a third of the picture lopped off. Gee, folks, can't you at least give us a choice to watch the entire movie?"
1,A Joke,"One reviewer called it the best Sherlock Holmes movie ever made. Well, to me, it's the worst ever made. Only the cinematography and the settings are worth a nod. The foreign accents are amateurishly inept and Holmes, never mind the stature of Nicol Williams, is quite miscast. Storyline and much of the dialogue are idiotic and aimed at a very low viewer intelligence"
3,Overrated adventure placing too much emphasis on subsidiary characters & making Holmes too speculative.,"Weaker, although authentically presented - the death by horses scene was absurd, Arkin was excellent but out of place in my view."
3,A bit disappointing,"Tape video was poor quality at first, then improved. By unfortunate coincident, the day it arrived Amazon offered the DVD version which I would have purchased had I known...or had a crystal ball."
1,Too Small,"This brooch is far too small and expensive for its size. I was shocked when I pulled it out of its pouch. May I iterate, it is far too small. Without a moment's hesitation this brooch was immediately returned."
4,"Excellent, but Maybe Not for the Uncircumcised","These are great condoms: extremely thin and very durable.The only general flaw that I can point to is my belief that they are somewhat under-lubricated. Other than that, I think the circumcised man would be quite hard pressed to find anything better. These are widely used by adult performers for a reason.However, the lack of lube and the snug average fit of these is a bit of a detriment to me, primarily due to having an uncircumcised penis. The restriction of motion inside the condom lead to instances of the condom being trapped between the foreskin during use, which is not entirely unpleasant but is distracting and suboptimal. Extra lube helps a lot, but is still not ideal.For those readers that are not cut, I highly recommend the12 Durex Maximum Love Condoms NEW! Larger and Thinner Condom for more Sensitivity and Sensation. These have a bulbous head and ample lube, to really maximize your experience."
1,i hate it,looks good only!!! :) you guys have to think twice or more before buy. make sure and odor and very dry
3,Good but not strong,"The price is good, but when I use it, I found it is not strong enough. It can break when use it."
1,irritating,"I've never had any kind of allergic reaction to condoms before, but these were highly problematic. It took a couple months for, er, things to be back to normal."
2,Not what I was hoping,"Unfortunately these can be sold by a variety of retailers and fulfilled by Amazon. I just bought some sold by ASBKC_Group, and unfortunately, these are the ""bad"" ones made in Taiwan. There goes my $10 gamble."
4,Great rubber for the price,"As other reviews have stated, these are a bit low on lube but that has not been a problem for me. Very nice natural feel. Pink color is a little different but no biggy."
5,Best I've had.,"In comparison to Trojan, Durex, and other major condom brands, these win hands down. They're the thinnest I've had, and the most dependable."
2,this condom routinely rips,I am not a very large individual but I would say 10-20% of the condoms rip. That is a major concern. Be careful if you are even slightly around average sized.Also mine did not come as a variety package. It was one type of the condom in a lose envelope (which was fine with me).
5,best condom ever used,"I've gone through quite a few different brands and none compared to this. Its is hands down the best feeling condom i have ever had and my girlfriend agrees as well, and unlike other thin condoms it does not rip easily. One issue I do have is in the circumference of the condom, as i am a little larger it is hard to get on and is a bit snug, so that's something to watch out if you are 7+inches(as i have used it more its become easier to put on). You won't find a better price at any drugstore either."
4,Protects on the cheap ^_^,"100ct for the price i paid is well worth it, these are perfect for a quick one, or just when you arnt worried about style of extra pleasure features. Its perfect for everything i do ^_^"
2,too small!,"Yes, they are super thin. However, we found them way too small. They were uncomfortable for my husband to wear and spoiled all the fun. Stay away from these if you consider yourself ""bigger."" We've read great reviews about these and were really dissapointed. So... two stars."
3,There Are Better Condoms!,"Both my girlfriend and I felt that these were fairly good condoms, esp. considering the price (about 16.5 cents each). They aren't as sensitive, for either of us, as other condoms we have used. We've been using Lifestyles ULTRA THIN condoms for several years now, after a lot of trial and error (tough job), and nothing compares. Plus, you can get the Lifestyles for about 12 cents each. Check here12 Lifestyles Ultra Thin Condoms, an Extra Sensitive Lubricated Condom."
2,These break wayyy too much.,"Don't get me wrong, these condoms make it feel as if you're not wearing anything if there's enough lubricant. The problem is, the second you start getting a little rough and start deep thrusting, these things break easily. I've had them break on me three times. They are also a little tight. I threw mine away. I'll be sticking with Trojan."
2,need extra lubrication,"The price of these condoms combined with the speed of the shipping are the only reasons this product received two stars. The reviews stating that these condoms feel like nothing are overexagerating. These condoms fit too snugly and feel like a raincoat. Additionally, the condoms are lightly lubricated so that if you last more than 5 minutes you have to stop and apply more lubrication. This can ruin the atmosphere and sometimes the mood. Anyways I will be keeping the last six of these condoms for emergencies and my gf and I will keep searching for the perfect condom."
3,Not sure which way to lean on this review,"Maybe it's because I usually have really rough sex or maybe my guy is really big, but these got very uncomfortable for me. Even when I was very aroused, the condom dried me out and caused quite a bit of discomfort. It didn't break, so I guess that's a plus. These condoms would definitely be best for a man of average girth. If you're really thick, don't get them. Just fyi :)"
1,Don't buy it,This condom has no (or too little) lubrication. The resulting friction is too high. It's difficult to move and causes pain and potential injury.
1,"horrible, horrible condoms","These were definitely too small (in terms of girth) and neither my boyfriend or I could feel a thing. They weren't lubricated very much either. I'm really disappointed, even more so since my order was delivered 5 days late. All that time wasted for nothing."
5,Charlie,"So I was with Charlie Sheen. Huge party tons of naked women and I asked him hey Chuck you bang lots of women, so naturally you must be an authority on condoms. With that said what would you suggest I use on these ladies. He replied Crown all the way. Thin well lubricated and they feel great! Good enough for Charlie good enough for anyone.Side note if your about to get busted with drugs put them in the crown condoms and ""hide them"" they are strong and won't break so you don't have to worry about overdosing while ""hiding them."""
1,Small and dry,"I made the mistake of purchasing a large quantity of these on sale instead of trying a few to see if we liked them first. Now, I'm stuck with 97 condoms that are all but useless. Maybe we'll have a balloon party.First of all, the packages can be difficult to gain access to. I wasn't intoxicated while using these, but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight, specifically the girth. While the material is very thin, I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all, these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller, but the questionable packaging, small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used."
2,Small,"this condoms is a nice a chip option , but they are small to use in a person Or toy 's whit a large and width penis.For the average its ok , the material so thin and can be broke easy , take a note in that ."
5,Ulalalalahhhh!,"I LoveD bare,I LoveD skyns, MY GIRL LOVES CROWNS and I do too! I was not sure about this product when I purchased it, some users complained about the smell, but it was not really bad. Skyns and Bare had more heat sensation that's why one would feel more sensation, but since HEAT in that area was never a problem for us (let's just say our thermostat down there is on high always) this just rocked our world! This works for me and my girl, so I highly encourage you guys to try it!!!"
5,Feel natural,"These are great - my husband says they definitely feel the closest to nothing at all, and we are both happy with them."
3,Not the thinest on the market as claimed,I bought these thinking they were the thinnest and found out later there are two Japanese brands that are half the wall thickness. I was able to compare these to Sagami and Okamotos where both transferred heat and sensation much better. These condoms are better than most other popular brands for what ever that is worth. I just dont think they are at the top of class.
5,extremely Thin,"Billed as 'The Closest Thing To Nothing At All', I must say these are some thin condoms. Okamoto delivers! I was tired of all the thick condoms and was ready to reject condoms altogether...even started using the 'pull and pray' technique, then I discovered Okamoto Crowns. Okamoto made me appreciate condoms once again. These are great for achieving that 'extra sensation'."
1,not as described,When i put in my order it was described as made in japan. I got my package and it is made in thailand.
3,Feel good but don't trust them too much.,"These condoms feel AMAZING. BUT, they do have a serious problem. Out of the ten or so we have used about a third of them have broken. So while they will make you never want to wear another condom only use them if you are really confident about your partner. (So basically if you don't really need one)"
4,It's Thin!,"I haven't tried every condom made in the world but I've tried most of the big name brands. Crown-Okamoto Super Thin Condoms are by far the thinnest I've ever tried and that's a great thing (except for the times when she doesn't want you to go just yet lol, but who doesn't have those times regardless). I highly recommend you try these out and so far I can't find a better price for condoms for the amount given. Gotta try these out!"
5,Sturdy and I got what i ordered!,"These shipped to me in strips of 6 and they expire in 4 or 5 years, very good and can handle a beating lol"
4,Perfect fit in more ways than one!,"These are awesome! Thin, great fit, lightly lubricated. Everything you need in a condom. I feel weird reviewing a condom, HA! But I think everyone should really try these. I think the only turn off is the pink color of them. But these are the only ones I will use."
3,"Cheap price, cheap product","Wouldn't trust these cheap guys to work well as birth control, but instead to use on various bedroom toys. Quite rubbery, PINK, but okay quality for condoms that only cost pennies a pop."
4,"Feels great, but make sure you have lube","My boyfriend loves these, and we haven't had problems with them. We have to use quite a bit of lube when we use them due to their dryness, but that may be why we haven't had any break on us. He likes the tightness and the feel of the condom, and they are the only condom we've tried that don't slip off. We love these and have had no issues with breakage so we plan to keep the bowl next to the bed full of these.Edit: After almost three years of only using this brand, we've had zero broken condoms and zero pregnancies. So I'm still really happy with these."
3,Snug but pretty good!,"These are pretty good condoms, but they are also a bit snug. If these are the best and thinnest condoms available with today's technologies, especially being manufactured in Japan, then I am sorry to say we are not as advanced as we are lead to believe."
3,read some good reviews but not that cool for me..,read some good reviews but not that cool for me.. its kinda dry and didn't like it much. therefore 3 star.
5,A Real Bargain for Quality Latex Condoms,"My gawd condoms are overpriced, however these are definitely not. I find these condoms help delay me from climaxing sooner than I want. It enables me to enjoy the pleasurable sensations of a lady's love tunnel substantially longer than expected. Will buy again."
2,Get what you pay for,I bought these because they have been called awesome by so many people. The problem is that they are small. DO NOT get these if you have a large penis.
5,awesome,"best price for the most amount of condoms, this is for people who need this many for the cheapest price and best quality available, they are even better then trojan condoms."
3,three because theyre cheap and they function!,the excessively pink color of these ruins whatever they offer on the side of economy. amazon condoms are cheap enough to 'splurge' on kimonos. go for it!
1,evil wrapper...,My girlfriend was gonna put one on me and cut her finger with the wrapper. Blood fell on my night stick.Killed the mood man.THANKS ALOT CROWN CONDOMSquantity and price is great.used the other 59 condoms within 2 weeks:)
2,Not what they claim to be,"We've had these condoms for over a year now... That should tell you enough about how much my wife and I like them. They really don't help with keeping the ""sensations"". My wife hates them and I really have to work to finish at times (and really - I'm not typically a marthon runner when it comes to sex).Some reviews claim these are knock offs....I'm lead to believe them since I've heard great things about this brand elsewhere."
4,The one,"These condoms are very good they will fit almost anything close to 9"" I like them they feel like you don't have anything on, It makes it feel as you are naked, and they come out easy with no mess. I would recomend it for the novice or the pros."
5,"Great product quality, best ones out there!","These are the best by far that I have ever bought. You won't go wrong with these. High quality, never breaks and are very thin. Been buying these for years and will never go back."
4,"Thin, but not the best","My wife and I have been in search for the best feeling condoms on the market. After some research, I've tried the Trojan Ultra Thin, Trojan Bare Skin, and these Okamoto Crown Super Thin. These are great, but I wasn't thrilled with 2 things (see Pro's and Con's below).Pro:-They are thin. Much better than the Trojan Ultra Thin condoms.-Durable and we have not experienced any breakage.Cons:-Strong rubber smell from these.-The Trojan Bare Skin felt much better than these.-These appeared to dry up faster having us re-lube every so often."
2,it breaks easier,"be careful, when using this. This is super thin. It will break if your gf is not wet enough.warning!"
4,Comes in a bag,"Other than that, not really a complain about it.Comes in a regular plastic/paper bag with the tape like thing on top to close it. So u better be the one to receive it, because easy to open and close with really noticing it someone did.Product was good. No complains"
2,Broke,"These condoms worked all right but the last one we used ripped around the base area, not sure if it was already broken or not but it was an unpleasant discovery. Thank god I'm on birth control."
4,As good as I imagine they could be.,"Product is very good, and retailers description and shipping was excellent. While I still prefer wearing nothing, these are about the next best option for me!"
4,Great Cheap Condoms,"I was bit surprised when it came in USPS loose package. Though, I've been using it since then and greatly satisfied with this product."
5,Awesome,"The best I've ever used. These are definitely the thinnest amongst any of the earlier ones I have used from Durex, to Trojan, to Lifestyles.Well packaged and super fast shipping. Great seller."
1,2nd batch too small,"I've bought these before on Amazon through a different 3rd party seller and all 100 were perfect - normal sized, thin, and slightly lubricated. This box of them that I just bought through the ""ChubbyDickEmporium"" however, are way too short, too constricting, and not lubricated. I cannot use them. Now I have to search for a new condom."
1,Breakage and stress,"2 out of the first 10 used broke, and I'm not even close to well endowed. Thanks for an unreliable product and unneeded stress..."
4,True to its name,"I was using Kimono and Durex extra thins before they raised the prices for condoms at my college and after researching online at Amazon, came upon these. They are great! Really thin but well made and we have not had any problems with the fit."
4,Very nice condom.,"I enjoy these condoms. I have to rank it #2 though, reason for the 4 stars. There's a lot of good quality from this condom, being that its the most thin condom on the markety makes it great for pleasure. I mean, if there was stubs or ribs...it may be better for her pleasure, but as a personal pleasure it ranks at the top. ""LIKE nothing is there at all.However, this condom is a little too snug. Granted being a snug on me which I'm no Mr ED, but with a girth 5""..it was a snug fit. With a snug fit comes advantages though such as, you know it'll never slip off. Also a tighter fit prolong the endurance.I still say Durex X-Sensitive is better. Just my opinion."
5,Nice,Best condoms I have ever used. Better than skyn condoms I have used. After I use these 100 I will buy more.I don't think you can get much better than these.
2,NOT your favorite new thin condom,This condom is just average. The thin Durex offer more sensation. I am very disappointed and would likely not use the product.
3,There's better things,No good feeling and nothin for bigger penis size .It does not smell bad but that fact changes nothin about the feeling.
1,They break.,"I stopped using these condoms after using about ten of them. Although they are great when they work, of the ten that I used three of them broke. I have never had another condom break on me."
3,too small,"difficult to review a condom without being descriptivie so i can only say that these are for average guys only. average i think is 6""they may be thin and reliable but if you are above average these will not fit =("
5,GREAT ENGLISH POP MUSIC,"This is just a great pop record.Every song on the cd could be a single from the rocky first song to the epic 10 minute finish.Stand out tracks have got to be ""sing all the saddest songs, Hey mona lisa and Heart as big as liverpool"" This has got to be the best cd released this year buy it and make it a hit."
4,"Mellow, Sad Dinah","This is a must have for those whose pain is still fresh in their minds (and hearts) from a recent break-up or to spend a rainy day in front of the fireplace. If you liked the ""What A Difference A Day Makes"" CD, this one is for you. I find the songs and Dinah on this CD to be melancholic, mellow and sad. We all know Dinah from her blues material, but here she is understated and mellow. Yet she still infuses each song with heartbreak and ache that rattles your soul. Standouts include the lesser known songs ""Alone"" and ""This Love of Mine"". Listen to this CD with a box of Kleenex."
4,Worth it for the Price!!!,"This is perfect if you plan on using this for lower back pain. I use this one for my lower back, and a gel type that is more flexible for my upper back.If I ever heal it will be perfect for bringing my lunches to work!"
4,Best Jumbo Cashews,"The large cashews would get a 5, but there are filler chopped cashews that are not great."
3,Better than nuffin'. Almost.,"Compared to an Ox's Tale, this is a tatty production. There is a lot of filler including John just standing in front of his amp noodling solo. Now, I'm a huge JE fan and a bass player myself, but even I can hardly stand to watch another man's noodle, let alone paying for that right. The interviewer and the interviewess frequently appear stiff, or in the case of John's late girlfriend, worse.It would have been nice to see some video of John's 70's band Rigor Mortis, but I'd have settled for some rehashed Who video. Either the producers couldn't afford or didn't bother to get any clearance of Who or Entwistle video material, so this is really a cheapo production. All of that being said, this rates three stars for some of the Entwistle humor poking through, and that there probably isn't much left in the vaults anyway. But if this DVD were a bass, I have no doubt John would have smashed the hell out of it. An Ox's Tale is superior to this."
3,Only significant because it occurred shortly before John's death,Fairly boring ramble around his life and home. Doesn't add much and would probably have been scrapped if he hadn't died shortly after.
4,Great doc on a Great Bassist,Great overall look into the life and music of John Entwistle. Recommended for any serious bassist or Who fan.
3,too much blaaaa blaaaaa,"I found this dvd a little disapointing, I should have love more john playing the bass ans less blaaa blaaaa"
4,A Great CD...that's not a lie,"Todd returns to old form...at least partially. This CD blends the 90's style Todd rhythm with 80's style Todd vocals. I have only listened to the whole CD once but it is a vast improvement over One Long Year. My favorite tracks are "" Sweet "" and "" Flaw"". Both really showcase Todd's unique vocal style. the production is flawless as usual but the disc lacks a lot of guitar work, being a guitarist that I tend to enjoy a healthy dose of guitar. Todd has given us a CD worth waiting 3 years for and a return to formulas that have made many of us diehard fans."
5,ooops he did it again..,"Oooops he did it again. Another classic album under his belt. A concept album like no other. Liars is full of phili soul..ballads, scorching lyrics, and beautiful melodys.. and quick witted humor.. What you have with liars is a cross between Something/Anything and Hermit of Mink Hollow. but very thought provoking..With a bit of magic.. musical magic... I have had ""Liars"" for a week already and i havnt taken it out of my cd player. An instant modern day classic.. TODD IS STILL GODD.."
1,"Original ARTIST, but REMADE hits","None of these are original recordings. Highly disappointing. The audio also has a weird echo, making all the songs sound like they were recorded in a dingy nightclub rather than a recording studio. But there are no audience sounds, so who knows. If you're looking for some classic ORIGINAL Roy Clark hits, don't bother with this one. You'll be disappointed. This one goes straight to the top of the ""trade-in"" pile for the local Used CD Store."
2,Ummm.. Don't know what to say,"I don't like this book so far. I haven't read all of it, and if my opinion changes, i intend to post another review. But after reading Flowers in the Attic, I find it hard to fall in love with Olivia like I did Cathy or any other heroines. She just seemed so harsh in FITA, that it's difficult to believe that this is the same grandmother"
3,Good story,"Embarrassing to admit that I liked these, but my mom loved them when she was younger and recommended them to me. It's not well written, but it's a good story."
4,Garden of Lies,"Althought it is a good book to read,ever noticed that Corrine and Olivia tell to different stories.For example.Olivia says that she caught Chris and Corrine in the Swan room, but Corrine tells her kids that they married on her 18th birth,then came back a week later and told her parents what they did.It is a fantastic book to read,but I get confused and that is hat recks the story.If it had been more scents,then it would have gotten 5 stars instead of 4."
3,'Tis why...,"Being the last of the series, I read it & was surprised to find out that it was actually meant to be a prequel instead. I only gave it a 3-star because it came in after a long series of the ""Flowers.."" & following everything through became quite boring. The only redeeming factor was that it was more of an introductory to the entire series & it pretty much explained the reasons behind the 'Dresden dolls' suffering & why a good-natured Olivia turned evil overnight."
1,This story line is getting really really really old,"I loved FLOWERS IN THE ATTIC. PETALS ON THE WIND was pretty good. When I read IF THERE BE THORNS it was okay. SEEDS OF YESTERDAY was pretty boring.But this book was shocking for somebody like me.Who really gives about what happened to the stupid granma. I got really bored reading about Catherine and Christopher and their little family, but I wouldn't have said anything bad about it.Then came this book. B-O-R-I-N-G. It makes girls and women sound soooooooo vulnerable to men. it's scary to think that anyone can even think like that. ""Everything you do wrong takes you one step closer to hell"" is the message you get from this book.I definately wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
5,Make sure to read this one last.,"Although this is a prequel to the Flowers in the Attic series, you should save this for last. This story wraps up some of the questions that you had in the earlier books. The book tells of the grandparents early years of marriage. I can not give away too much only to say that this book reveals the true reason that Corrine was disinherited and sets up the horrifying legacy that would follow them."
3,Not as good as I expected!,"Yes, the book helps you to understand why the 'wicked old grandmother' is the way she is. because she thinks her grandchildren are 'demons', and who can blame her? It is a fact that the offspring of siblings are missing a few genes here and there and can turn out to be 'different'. But, really, the only thing you find out from reading the book is that Corrine and Christopher are half-brother and sister rather than half-uncle and niece. It is a good book, but I don't think there is as much of a storyline as 'Flowers in the Attic'. I think the book goes on for too long, after all it starts when Olivia is twenty-four years old and ends with her at the age of sixty-four. it does prove that even wicked people have some love in them though, for she truly loved her sons, Mal and Joel."
5,A must-read!,"This is the last novel in the series, and I just loved it. I'm glad we finally got to meet the warped and enigmatic Malcolm Foxworth...AND see that the grandmother, Olivia, was at one time a human being. I also like Garland and Alicia. This book was haunting and unforgettable."
1,FERTILIZER FOR THE GARDEN,"This story was so bad that it was EMBARRASSING! Olivia, the matriarch of the Dollanganger twins is featured in this tired prequel. Bitter and resentful over her lot in life, she marries an unloving man named Malcolm and has two sons.Irate over Malcolm's adulterous ways, Olivia understandably resents Malcolm's latest love interest, the lovely Alicia. She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne. Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother. During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household. Common sense does not enter into this story.This book is good fertilizer for the garden."
5,Wow,"After reading the rest of the Dollanganger series, I was naturally eager to start this book. It is stunning how a woman that you end up feeling sorry for turns into such a horrible person in FitA. Yes, Olivia went through a bad transformation, but here you see who the REAL villain is. Tempting hints of Malcolm and Olivia's turbulent relationship with one another and their children and grandchildren were hinted at in previous books, but here, from Olivia's own viewpoint, we see why she has suffered. Mind you, this doesn't absolve her of the bad things she did, but you can see how she became the kind of person she did, and what led Chris and Corrine to run away from home. Bravo for such a wonderful book."
5,"Just as good, if not better, than FLOWERS.","I loved this book! Olivia was such a wonderful storyteller, and although she's completely despicable in FLOWERS, I learned through her story why she turned out the way she did and was able to empathize with her.She put up with a lot of abuse yet managed to keep her equilibrium. Most people would have gone off the deep edge if they had to live through what she did. But she holds it together; it wasn't till the end of the story, when she hits an emotional low after the deaths of her sons, that she is cajoled into becoming a religious fanatic by her cousin John Amos.Corinne's letter in which she requested to return to Foxworth Hall with her children was very touching and my favorite part of the book."
4,The Beginning of the Foxworth Family,"This Book is the beginning of everything that happened to the Foxworths and the generations below them. Olivia always wanted her dreams to come true but they did the opposite. And she became a very mean lady the same as her husband Malcom Foxworth. If not worse then him. I thought this was a very good book. I've seen Flowers in the Attic on t.v. But I never knew how it began until I read this book. If you haven't already read the other books you should. There is Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind, and If There Be Thorns. I'm sure theres more to it.. I haven't read If There Be Thorns yet But I'm sure it's just as good as the rest!!!!"
4,Garden of Shadows,"Being the last book in the 'Flowers in the Attic' series, Garden of Shadows ties a lot of loose ends.This is the Grandmother's story (Olivia Winfield Foxworth), and it tells the story of her marriage to Malcolm Foxworth, and ends when Flowers in the Attic more or less begun - when Chris, Cathy and the twins arrive in Foxworth Hall and are left in the attic.We get to learn how the grandmother became what she was - tough, cold and extremely religious. While this understanding doesn't necessarily give us understanding or justification's to Olivia's future behavior, it is hard not to feel for what she has to go through, especially in the beginning."
3,A cold and twisting horror.,"Garden of Shadows, by V.C. Andrews was a dark and vengeful book. After Olivia marries Malcom she discoveries her blond haired, cerulean blue eyed husband is the not the romantic sweet man she thought she married. As the book goes deeper into the shadows of Foxworth Hall it becomes more twisted. I found this book to be cruel and depresing. It does keep your attention well with calmly revealing the secrets hidden in this awesome mansion. I thought this to be intriguing, yet harshly sad."
1,shirt fine company is a junk mailer,Shirt arrive in good condition BUT the company filled my mailbox with junk mail so much so that I had to out a block on anythig that came from them
2,Wink Wink Nod Nod We Are So Clever,"Don't get me wrong Spider Robinson is my favorite author but not even the warmth of Key West where this novel is set could warm me up to it.This is a valuable lesson. Sometimes we must give up our fictional friends. Jake and his friends seem tired and need to rest. They have entertained us but now I feel like a guest at a party that has overstayed his welcome. Everbody is going through the motions but I just don't feel it.One of the things I really didn't like is Jake and his crew's attitude of: ""We are so clever Nod-Nod Wink-Wink."" Everybody has some sort of power incuding his kid. It seems they are running into the same wall that Superman in the comics did. You make a character or a group of them so powerful you really have to strain to come up with a problem worthy of them.In short this book seemed a bit to much by the numbers.As much as I love the characters I hope this is the last I see of them. I will remember them fondly from prior books."
2,Not the Best Callahan's Book,"I've been reading Spider since my first-edition copy of Antinomy 20 years ago (which I still have). This book was, in a word: lame. Too much reliance on mind altering drugs and old formulas. The plot (if you want to call it one) is too formulaic. It takes Spider almost half the book to get them from New York to Key West, another quarter of the book to establish the new bar, and the last quarter to save the world. Where are the puns and character development that made the Callahan's Bar stories so much fun to read? Sorry, Spider. Even Ralph would call this one a dog."
1,Worst Spider Robinson book I have read,"I have loved Callahan books.I have loved almost everything by Spider Robinson before this book.I had great expectations before I started to read this one. Sadly I had to be very disappointed. It seems Spider had material for a short story, and got a contract for a novel. Never have I encountered such amount of padding in any book before. There literary pages and pages of pure, unadulterated padding. There are paragraphs full of names, which are repeated a few pages later. There are sidetracks in the story which lead nowhere, and have no relation with the main plot of the story, and have practically no entertainment value at all.This might have been a fine short story, but this is a horrible novel."
4,Unquestionably the weakest of the series.,"Still, since the others were spectacularly fun, that's what I call ""praising with faint damns"". It is a good time, and it's great to have another story about characters I've come to enjoy. Unlike other reviewers, I won't say that someone unfamiliar with the series shouldn't read this one; I don't think it would be all that hard to get a feel for this series from this book. But it WOULD be BETTER to start at the beginning, with ""Callahan's Crosstime Saloon"". Every book in this series is great fun, and well-written."
3,"Not his best, but worth the read","Okay, nothing Spider ever will write will probably match the earliest books in the Callahan series. It's a tired series, but I'm still guiltily pleased to see yet another book appear. I *love* those characters, they feel like family to me.This book was weak on the plotline, yes, I agree. Definitely. But so what? I didn't read the book for the plotline, I read it for the puns, the clever words, and the occasional (but important!) philosophical detours taken. (Not to mention all the Irish Coffee....) I loved Harry, the fowl-mouthed parrot (yeah, I pun now too). The talking infant was a bit much, but if you can accept a talking dog (and I love Ralph) I guess that's not too much of a stretch.If you want a deep plot, this is not the book for you. If you want to be distracted from daily life, get a few laughs in, and goof off, this is a good choice."
4,Callahan's Key is a trip!,"The US orbiting defense system is bombarded by a freakish cluster of natural phenomena; its target is not just the US or the Earth: it is total & only one man can stop the devastation.Unfortunately he is unavailable so the job falls to bar owner Jake Stonebender & his wife Zoey with their superintelligent toddler Erin.In a risable blend of good science fiction & bad puns this is the saga of a caravan of busses replete with ex-hippies & freaks; drugs; rock'n'roll; Robert Heinlein's wandering cat; a converted cop; a whorehouse parrot & the much misunderstood genius-inventor Nikola Tesla, our hero rumbles off to the rescue...."
2,"Conserve narratives: reuse, reduce, recycle","First, there is nothing new in this book. Everything he says here he has said in the earlier books. Second, there is very little in the way of plot or character development. You are halfway through the book before the threat to the universe is even described. All the characters are almost cameo reprives of previous performances. Except the new characters who are introduced and then promptly droped from the narrative. Third,the few more or less new notes are nearly all obvious reworkings from other writers. The eighteen month old hyperprecocious girl who knows the size of her father's erect penis and has started a waiting list of partners for when she begins having sex just reeks of the Lazarus Long style of deliberately shocking sexuality. Based on this book I would say Spider Robinson has become a tired old man."
3,He's done better,"The story, such as it is, tells of the migration of the group formerly known as Calahan's from Long Island to Key West and what happened after.There's very little to the story. While it was quite readable, I found it contrived compared to his other work. Basically, everything which happens after they settle in at Key West could have been cut with an over-all gain to the resulting story. I'm still curious about what happens next, though.It's worth buying if you're really ""into"" the Calahan's Bar stories or you really like Spider Robinson's work. Otherwise, try his other stuff instead."
1,Please don't buy this book,"I loved the Callahan series. In fact, I love most of what Spider Robinson has written, but this book is boring, self-serving and exists only to help him pay for his latest vacation.I gave this book every chance I could. I would think ""this is boring"", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think ""what a stupid plotline"", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think ""this book is going nowhere!"", but because it was Spider, I read on.Two chapters from the end, the book attempts a plot twist. At that point I thought, ""You know what, I don't care."", and I closed the book.I never slam a book without offering an alternative. If you want to read an excellent book, try Amy Thomson's ""The Color of Distance"" instead. Leave this one on the book store shelf."
5,Great introductory chess course for kids and adults!,"This is a great product for all beginners, kids and adults alike. No previous knowledge of chess is assumed. Dean Ippolito, who is a well-known international player and a professional chess teacher, explains the basics of chess such as how the pieces move, and them moves on to more complex subjects, including how to play openings, how to checkmate, and tactical tricks you can use to outsmart your opponent. Anybody can become a chess player with this excellent 2-DVD course!"
2,Very disappointing,"As a big fan of Rimsky Korsakov's operas (I have at least one audio recording of all of his operas and am collecting the DVDs as they slowly come along), I was looking forward to this production of May Night. I was disappointed. The recorded sound is poor (distant) and the production itself - sets and costumes - is quite odd.For me, decoding the action required a libretto with stage directions and fortunately a complete libretto came with the 1994 Saison Russe recording.We have been fortunate to have some of Rimsky's operas show up in good to excellent DVD productions: Le Coq d'Or, Sadko, Mlada, Tsar's Bride. Even the quirky and drastically cut Tsar Saltan of Harry Kupfer is wonderful in comparison to this newest entry. Let's hope a good Kitezh or Snow Maiden comes along at some point."
1,Good performance - bad opera,"This opera has pretty good singing and that's pretty much all. The sets and cosumes are just Eurotrash and the opera itself has little plot and even less interest. The music is Rimsky Korsakov at his most mechanical and even the orchestration disappoints --- which is unusual for this composer. Unless you enjoy watching a group of stupid drunks stumble around and hit one another, it is simply not worth watching."
3,Decent Airbus Book,"This is an interesting, light read, with a point of view on the European-American rivalry in aviation. The number of names and personalities sometimes gets overwhelming, and it would be nice to include a bit more of the technical story, but otherwise not a bad book."
3,Interesting,It was not what I expected. If true very enlighting.An account of a meeting with a faery and tells hiim alot of information.
1,Blah,"I was underwhelmed. It may be that Matthews tuned into a sidhe, but his personal writing lacked gravitas for me, and what the sidhe had to say was way too general. I must have expected some fire, incisive thinking. At the very least a rip-roaring good yarn."
4,Great new insight in the Sidhe,"This book is a wonderful and easy read and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who's not only interested in the Sidhe, but also anyone who's open minded on world events today and what's happening to us as a planet and species. This book gives a wonderfully different perspective on the Fairy realm but also doesn't diminish the idea of the fantastical. My philosophy is that if you continue to hear a common thread is a variety of different sources, books, areas, etc. Then that common thread is truly worth paying attention to. This book is right along those lines but also gives new perspective and insight."
3,the shining ones speak,"we are really not big on channeled books...dear lovers of the Sidhe,... and the author of this book writes he feels the same way about them. None the less, we read this one because it was about, and if we are to believe him, by the Sidhe and we love nearly all things to do with Faerie and Faeriekind. Still, there is not much here that is new or revelatory. There is nothing said in it that nearly all of those who would be inclined to read the book would not know already. So why are we recommending it, even if not very strongly? Because, the exercises he suggests in the end are quite valid and while this book adds little new, it does remind us of those things that are good to remember. We must say, for our own part we enjoyed his bookThe Secret Lives Of Elves & Faeries: From the Private Journal Of The Rev. Robert Kirk, much more, and we also love hisThe Celtic Shaman's Pack: Exploring the Inner Worlds/Book and Cards.kyela,the silver elves"
3,Sidhe interview,"This book was a page turner yet lacked a magic I hoped to read in the dialog between the author and the Sidhe. The questions and answers were a wee bit too mundane and research oriented of such a mysterious presence. Otherwise, it is interesting and worth the read."
3,What You Sidhe Is What You Get,"This is basically a channeling book, so you either accept what is presented as authentic or not. The message isn't new--save the planet, save ourselves (and the reverse)--but the setting confers a touch of Otherworld atmosphere that teases the imagination. It could all be blarney--or not. Without authenticating evidence, you are free to fulfill your own expectations."
2,Deeply Disappointing Outing by the Flamenco Maestro,"This album is a deep disappointment. On 'Siroco', Paco had pushed the boundaries of Flamenco yet kept its roots. This album, in contrast, sounds like an uninspired rehash. Even the Bulerias 'Compadres' - with Manolo Sanlucar - generates no excitement at all. (Compare this to any Bulerias by Cameron with Paco and Tomatito playing.) The track Zyryab just passes me by - elevator music. Skip this, get Siroco instead."
3,Fun but Unfinished,"This game is fun to play, but it seems unfinished. The graphics only look right at about 1/2 the angles, and if you zoom in they look really bad, I guess they didn't bother making new sets of graphics for each zoom level, too bad, because the main graphics are pretty good, considering it's a 2D isometric view.Gameplay is good though, easy to understand and fun, and there's lots of animals and objects to build with, as well as a free-play mode in addition to the scenarios. The only bad part is you have to wait till more objects are 'unlocked' to use them, even in free-play mode.All in all not a bad game, but not great either, especially considering the price."
2,A major bug in the program,"This could've been a pretty cool game, but I've become frustrated with it in just one week because of a software glitch.It seems that after you've been running your zoo for a while, you start getting messages that your guests are hungry or thirsty, even if you've added plenty of food and drink stands for them. Although there is a downloadable patch which is meant to address this probelm (...), it didn't work on my system. And the problem multiplies - soon the animals are hungry, even though their zookeepers are right there, and should be feeding them.It seems to me that even if it HAD worked, it's a little unfair to expect users to have to go download a patch just to make the game work. Microsoft should never have released it with a problem this obvious. Have they not heard of playtesting?My recommendation is to WAIT until an updated version has been put on the market before buying it."
4,"Run a Zoo, Have a Little Fun","In Zoo Tycoon you get to run your own zoo. (I'm sure you could have guessed that.) You set up animal exhibits, roadpaths in your zoo, and tourist facilities. When you set up the animal exhibits, the creatures you put in those cages are REALLY picky. Some want this, while others want that and it is difficult to please all the animals in a single exhibit. (They usually agree better if they're the same species of animal.) This game is fun for the first few hours, but soon gets boring. I suggest playing a demo of this game before purchase."
1,Horrible game dont waste your money,"I love Rollercoaster tycoon, its exciting and fast action. Zoo tycoon is so slow and scenerios are so short you have no fun trying to beat the scenerio. i just find it a waste of time and money"
3,not bad...........,"This wasn't actaully a horrible game, but it wasn't the best one i have ever played before. In zoo tycoon, you have to build a zoo, and make it so that lots of people come, and the animals and people are happy. It was hard for me to keep all of the animals happy when my zoo got bigger, because i had to make sure all of these other animals were happy first. At times you have to check in with your visitors to see how much they like the zoo. Usually they will have some problem for you to solve by buying something- like more bathrooms or garbage cans. So, all in all, this wasnt a horrible game, but it could have been better."
1,Worst Simulation Game Ever,Pros: NoneCons: Bad GraphicsBoring GameplayMoney System guarentees you'll be broke unless you stick to th tightest budget possible.[It's just like] Roller Coaster TycoonUnecaseraly HardMore furnishing animals cages and keeping them happy than running a zooPrice is overdown this plays like [a]game out off a bargain boxWith in 25% hour of playing it you'll start to loose intrest
3,Not That Much Fun......,I thought this game was going to be as awsome as Rct but it seems that it isn't. I really dont think it is that addicting like the sims or rct. I think this is a pretty cruddy game and would need to be improved on.
4,Excellent Game,"I recieved this game for Christmas and I love it. You get to build your own zoo, creating exibits, pick animals, designing landscapes, and watch people in you zoo enjoy it. I would highly recomend this game."
5,zoo tycoon.............,"this is a really good game,it has a ton of cool features like: you can Pick from a bunch of differnt animals,you can build their habitats,hire empolyees,build refreshment stands for guests,build entertainment for the guests,and a ton of other things.I think you would like this game if you enjoy tycoon-type games and/or are interested in zoos.....and if you have a lot of patience..."
3,Don't Feed the Animals...,"Zoo Tycoon tries its best to capitalize on the whole ""Tycoon"" genre. But dialogs and settings are somewhat confusing, and keeping your animals happy is a full time challenge. (Just wait until you try to get past the Endangered Cats scenario.) But overall this game is a good addition to anyones tycoon/simulation collection....expecially if you've always wanted to run your own animal park."
2,I expected it to be better.,"I was eagerly anticipating this game before it came out but after playing it for only a month I found that I was quickly getting bored with it. It gets very tedious to make the animals habitats in a way that keeps them happy and I found myself getting annoyed with them wanting more grass, more dirt, more fresh water, on and on and on. The scenarios are particulary boring and don't add anything interesting to the gameplay."
5,This Game is so good!,It is not hard at all! at first when I buoght it i thought it was going to be really hard but when i started to play they gave pre-games tutorials that help you figure out how to play. This game is so addictive I can play it for hours and not get bored! It is not a rip-off every penny is worth it! this game is very easy to learn and fun to play! You should definitely consider buying this game!
2,"Close, but buggy, and the fix isn't.","There's no excuse for this game to run that slowly once you have more than about 10 exhibits and 500 guests.What's more, when reloading saved games, the exhibit numbers get incremented by the number of exhibits each time, and the game appears to slow down accordingly as well, including scrolling and accepting clicks.This makes it unplayable.It's fun until it starts to choke, then it's simply annoying.The choking on size was NOT a problem until after I loaded the ""fix"". Before I loaded the ""fix"" it would only crash, not slow down.If this gets fixed, it will be a good game."
2,Dull,"I hate my maintenance people, I have about a hundred of them and still my park is trashed they just walk around out back and do nothing. My food is maxed out and my Entrance fee is also and they still come in droves. Needless to say this is a dull and boring game with little challenge and little of that ""pride of accomplishment feeling"". I did learn some new things about my animal's habitats though..."
2,Not Much Creativity Invovled At All,"Zoo Tycoon as a game is not very fun. The only part about it that might be fun is the fact that the game does not take much time and that it is very easy, especially if you have the strategy guide which is very helpful, but if you have don't expect to be using much brain power when playing this game. Overall I would give this game about a 71%. I'd recommend Roller Coaster Tycoon over this game any day. RTC is at least a bit challenging and some creativity is invovled with it."
3,This tycoon hits the big one.,"I am a kid but I get all great grades and know how to rate games. Zoo Tycoon is fun to fool around with. The graphics are good and you can easily access info. about your animals. My only problem is that after playing for a while, it isn't fun anymore. You already constructed a few exibits and there isn't much more to do. Your animals escape a few times and it starts to seem get boring just watching animals. Zoo Tycoon is a good game to borrow from a friend but I wouldn't really buy it."
2,ZooTycoon,"Zoo Tycoon is a great idea and has lots of potental. Beware of trouble. Its is not very compatible with all computer systems. There are alot of software conflicts that I have come across. Tech support is so-so from Microsoft for this game. They always blamed it on the computer and its software that was preloaded. What's so funny is that my new DELL computer is preloaded with Microsoft software. The troubles I am referring to are lock-ups, freezing and slowness of game prior to locks-ups/freezing. Microsoft needs to fix the problems with software conflicts especially when its their software that is the conflict. Graphics and the ideas of the game are great."
4,Good game,This game must be good. But it remdinds me on Roller Coaster Tycoon. It's the same way how to build. But I think the idea is great. So. Must be a good game.
2,Fun game but doesnt work on my computer!,"I got this game for Christmas and It didnt work on my computer, it would go to 38% and then screw up and start making weird sounds and not install anymore. I tryed it on my friends computer, she has a much newer computer and more memory and it worked, its a wonderful game and I really hope I can get it to work so I can play it."
4,Similarity to Roller Coaster Tycoon is no coincidence...,"When I heard that Zoo Tycoon(ZT) is coming, I expect zoo version of that famous and interesting Roller Coaster Tycoon(RCT). And I found that my speculation was correct...so much! Don't get me wrong. I'm not sorry that ZT is similar to RCT. Actually I'm a bit satisfied and relieved that this is not the case of Pool of Radiance which tried to be different from Baldur's Gate and a bit failed in a gaming sense. All in all, I enjoyed ZT as much as I've enjoyed RCT. And I prefer animals to coasters...I am actually having more fun. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because ZT has no breaking-through ideas which is, as I mentioned before, good for this game."
4,SO FUN!,"My daughter, age 8, and I just love to play this game together. She thinks its great to buy animals and create cage environments where her animals are so happy they even have babies. She laughs when all of mom's animals are getting sick or even escaping a poorly designed cage. This game is clever, easy to work without endless hours pouring over the manual, and just plain fun. And now my 8 year old knows you can't put a lion in a deciduous forest!!"
5,My 5 year old loves it,"When we first purchased this game we told our 5 year old that this was an adult game and that he'd have to wait a few years before playing it. He watched us for awhile, got the hang of it and now creates a better zoo than his parents and he's not yet reading. It certainly helps to be able to read but much of it can be done without. Its great for learning about animals and their environments. We highly recommend this game as an alternative to [other gaming] trash. Enjoy!"
3,"Fun, but loses interest fast","This game has alot to it, but not enough to KEEP you going. After building a few zoos with various animals, you really have no control over it. The scenery is intriguing, the animals look realistic, but do not act realistic, nor do your customers. Its not as easily manipulative as such games as Roller Coaster Tycoon, etc. Im glad I bought it, but its been gathering dust since a few days after it arrived."
4,Great learning tool.,"I haven't spent much time with this program yet but it has excellent potential for kids and adults who need to see the value of planning ahead.The graphics are nice and some of the instructions are funny, tongue in cheek stuff. All in all a good PC game if you have time to fiddle with it."
5,Great family game,"I got this for my 6 year old who loves animals thinking that she would get into it down the road. We play now at least 4 times weekly and my 4 year old joins in. We have built fairly complex scenario's and I am now only needed to read some of the comments. They list mild violence, but that is only if you break down the walls on purpose and let animals eat guests. We just never do that. I am amazed at the things that my daughter comes up with to build. It allows great creativity and hours of fun for us all."
2,Snoozer-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"People say one of the drawbacks for this game is--because it is too much like Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I, a lover of almost all simulation games and Roller Coaster Tycoon, I disliked this game. Unless you find the concept exciting, do NOT buy this game.Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while (for me, two or three hours) the game became monotanous and boring. It was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelf.Also, unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups. My friend's on (12 yrs. old) loves this game with a passion.So to conclude, I would only recommend buying this game if.....-The idea of building a zoo appeals to you.-If, you are not buying for youself, primarily younger people will take an interest in this.-You don't mind a somewhat monotonous game play."
3,Good for the Animal Lover,"This game is fun at first with its detail graphics, colorful zoo objects and excellent animation. The player gets a fair amount of animals, plants and settings to start out with, and more options with progress. The panda is the last animal to be available for adoption and by then you have every other possible thing for the guests. Eventually you come to a point where it's confusing to keep track of your animals and hard to satisfy your customers without going broke. This is a very laid back sort of game with only a slightly challenging goal. It lacks the competition and excitement that would keep you coming back for more. In the long run the game becomes boring and predictable. Even after you've tried all the wrong things just to see what would happen.Zoo Tycoon is your average educational game with the same average entertainment value. It's nice for those who have a big interest in animals. Try getting it used if you can."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I really wanted to like this game. I did. The concept was good, the features seemed exciting, and I thought that I would spend many weeks enjoying the game. I was wrong. The game play is awkward. There is a patch on the website that helps a bit, but it doesn't fix everything. The zookeepers and maintence workers do their assigned tasks and then wander off into the undevoloped areas of the park, and then when there is a problem you have to hunt them down and physically move them to where they should have been all along. I have a pretty decent computer with more than double all of the requirements, but the game will still crashed on me. Stick with Rollercoaster Tycoon and its add-on packs, and if you complete all of the theme parks there, then keep searching for a new game. Don't think that Zoo Tycoon will be the fix that you need until more Rollercaster Tycoon add-on packs come out like I did."
2,crashes and bugs,"This game had potential.........but they never worked out the bugs! I find myself worrying about whether the stupid game is going to crash more than winning it! Not only that but you have to start the research projects all over again when the game crashes...even if you saved it. The animals also have issues....like my penguins who after a few months in zoo time froze. I truly was disappointed next time I hope Microsoft fixes the game b4 they release itHowever despite all this...I mastered the game in a few days. Maybe I became tired with the game because I never got far enough to unlock the secrets, which cannot be done if the game crashes every two seconds."
5,best sim game out there,I have played about every sim out there and this one is by far the best. The animals are demanding and the guests are very hard to please which makes things interesting and very time consuming. Picking up poop piles can become a hassle and it seems like no matter what I do I have still have tons of hungry guests. I usually end up spending hours on this game. It's definately one of my favorites.
3,To mauch crashing,"I enjoy playing the game and making the animal enclosures, especially with the Shift 4 money cheat so I can just build...build...build. However, I recommend saving OFTEN. THe game will suddenly crash for no apparent reason. Another wonderful microsoft creation. I was half way through a scenerio the other night and forgot to save and the game crashed. It can be very frustrating. Other than that its a pretty neat game."
1,Microsoft no longer supports this game...DON'T BUY IT!!!,"Microsoft no longer provides telephone support for this game. They only provide support for Zoo Tycoon 2. Since I have a new Service Pack for XP this product won't even run on my PC, They neglected to tell customers this as well. And still they allow suppliers to sell the game to anyone..... Boo Microsoft!! Get your money back now!!!"
5,Wonderful music!,"This CD is a treasure, both for parents and babies/children. Of all the baby gifts I received when my daughter was born, this one is in the top 10. The songs are sweet and soothing without being saccharine or cloying. The title track is adorable, as is ""Right Here, Right Now. I cannot recommend this cd too highly!!!"
5,Brio is great,"Brio is hard to get in the US now, thanks to new legislation. The magnets on their trains are great, I find that some brands just dont stay together well."
4,Great plot involving the supernatural,"Sarah keeps seeing her cat Shadow. Her dead cat Shadow. Things are happening too fast for Sarah. Her older brother is home from college, her mother hires a new housekeeper, and Shadow keeps appearing in dreams. Her brothers fight often and their parents ignore them. Nobody believes that Shadow is there. Then it happens, the reason why Shadow had stayed instead of processeding on to the cat afterlife.Shadow is a nice, spenceful book that mixes in a bit of supernatural into the usual (if extreme) problems of life. The characters are well delevoped and rounded off nicely."
2,Intriging but not great.,"The author apparently had 17 and 18 year olds in mind when she wrote this book. Filled with sex and profanity, Shadow is exciting, disturbing, and not that great. Joyce Sweeney has a nack for suspence but absolutely no taste."
4,Good quality,"This roller bag is quite sturdy, and it's convenient that there are back straps to carry like your traditional backpack (not recommended if you have the entire thing filled with heavy books, of course).A few downsides:-the back pouch is larger, but it has been difficult for me to fit in anything in addition to my 12"" wide, 1.5"" thick laptop, 2.75"" textbook, and a 3"" binder.-if you're not used to rolling around a backpack on the ground, you have to be somewhat conscientious about your turns around corners because it doesn't maneuver sideways - and that's not fun when you're lugging around a ton of books in that, in addition to carrying a traditional backpack with more books (I'm a nursing student with a plethora of books and supplies).- it is taller than it is deep - problem that will cause issues with stuffing multiple large textbooks into."
5,Geotrax teaches cause and effect to young children,I love these Geotrax system toys and my two year old just cannot get enough of it! I think he really likes the sense of control it gives him that he can make the train go and stop. What great toys! We just got the harbor docks and lighthouse to add to our collection for christmas and it is a hit. Also I just think it is adorable and my favorite piece. It has a sensor and when the train goes through it lights up and makes ocean and sea gull sounds. How cute. The lighthouse is not the only thing that lights either...you should see my sons face! A great toy for boys or girls. Easy to set up and take down...which is great because it takes up a lot of room. We have a great time setting up a different track everyday though. Hours of entertainment.
1,Worthless book,Difficult to follow and no solutions.... examples are few and far between.... By far the most worthless chemical engineering book I've used... only one I'm sure I'll sell at the end of the semester.... the author is incomplete... I found few discussions interesting... there's got to be better out there?!
2,Not worth it,"Not impressed with this blanket. It is soft, not tough or lumpy at all but is very light and carries little weight. Not much inside it at all as far as stuffing. That's not so bad, though.The fabric is the big problem. It is silky in the way a sleeping bag is, not like a smooth cotton-based fabric. The blank is very loud in motion with friction and has a rough synthetic texture.Other than that, the ""clover"" color I ordered is not the very light green as shown on Amazon, but a darker pea soup green. ""Puke green"", perhaps. I sent mine back within minutes of taking it out of the plastic bag.Might be a soft-enough servicable throw, but not for the price I paid. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for this."
5,Great Blanket for One.,"This blanket is soft, fluffy, warm, and easy to wash. Mine is blue and the color is very nice. I really have no complaints about this product, I just occasionally wish it were bigger! It gets a little crouded if two people try to share."
3,I have not read yet,"This is another that I have not read yet. Like the other books of biographies, I'm curious to know more about my idols in this case, Anjelica Huston .."
2,Partially inacurrate - Grobel needs to do more homework!,"Many things written about Collin Green in this book are untrue, and Larry Grobel should have known better after meeting him in person. But apparently he chose to take the word of others without checking out whether it could be true or not, medically. How many other things did Mr. Grobel just take people's word on, without checking them out?!? Collin Green would certainly be justified in suing Mr. Grobel and the publisher to have those things removed from any future printings and is owed an apology!"
4,Intro to performance,"This book is a great surprise - Jill Dolan is perhaps the best author to date to tie the bond between performance theory and feminist theory. This book is mostly centered in the '80s aproach - however - its academic and demi-historical approach sets the base of what has become the standard view (and role) of sexuality tied in with performance, poststructuralism, and feminist theories."
1,Slow to ship,"I'm writing a review for the first time because I've never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience. I bought cell phone cases from World of Bags so that I could give them as Christmas gifts. I ordered them on December 5th. It took them until December 19th to confirm that they were being shipped! It was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items. [Amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products.] Needless to say, I did not get to give them away as Christmas gifts. This is the type of service I got for choosing standard shipping -which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases(I can't specify how much because they won't let me post prices in reviews)! They also shipped them seperately. A sign of inefficiecy, indeed. One came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box. I've decided to not return the items because I want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again."
2,Only Mildly Amusing,"I'm a diehard dog lover and I also love books of wit. I appreciate clever photos and good, snippy bogus captions. Nonetheless, I did not find ""Bad Dog"" to live up to its promise. I hate to say it but this book is no ""Bad Cat.""This latter used the natural expressions of felines and some candid photography to really make a witty little coffee table and gift book. ""Bad Dog"" tries to do the same but ultimately fails. It fails because it relies mainly on staged photos of dogs in silly costumes instead of on the natural expressiveness of canine faces and the wide varitey of breeds, not to mention the interesting places dogs end up.Yes, there are some cute costumes and some witty captions here, but on the whole, the book is only mildly amusing. I am afraid that I cannot recommend ""Bad Dog"" as a gift or even for one's own light perusal. If there comes a third volume in this series, we can hope it will be titled ""Bad Editor!"""
2,A Bit Forced,"While some of the images and quips are funny, many are too forced. There are a lot of 'dress up' dog pictures which is fine, but the little sayings underneith don't always work.I think the title of this book is very misleading. These dogs don't look 'bad' at all. Few if any are doing anything but posing for the photograph."
5,Thurber-worthy,Ridiculous and wonderful. Silly dogs of all shapes and sizes...don't leave it out on the table if you don't want to be giggling all day.
4,No kidding,My dog ate this book the first day we left her alone in the same room with it. Seriously.
3,Too much sex humor for a dog book,"This book is funny, but I've never seen the Bad Cat book, so I can't really compare it. But I agree with those who felt that too many of the funny photos had some stupid, sexual caption that wasn't really funny - and I'm no prude - but it's not a book I'd feel comfortable sharing with others who might really be offended, or with teens/kids."
4,really cute,I bought this book because I own Bad Cat. I think this book is witty and funny but not quite as good as the cat one. Most of the pictures did make me crack up laughing but I laughed harder and at more pictures in the cat book. I would still recommend it to anyone as it is really funny but they should definitely buy Bad Cat as well.
2,Not even good enough to buy.,"Finally I thought ""a sequel to Bad cat"" because I have dogs and cats. I always look at Amazon reviews before I buy a book but sometimes not on Amazon. Sorry Amazon!I went to Borders and looked at Bad dog. I was not happy. I do not like my daughter or me reading sex jokes about dogs and watching them pee or poopoo. Bad cat was easier on her eyes excet the word sh&t.;Perhaps teenagers wrote Bad dog in their bathroom at school. Too much toilet humor and just dogs in costumes or angry snarling at you. Misses the edge of Bad cat and not as clever. The jokes are not funny unless a dog on the beach saying ""oh I love the beach"" is funny.Other reviews here say this is great and fantastic. I wish they would share their pot with me so I could laugh at the jokes too 8(i did not buy the book and do not recommend unless you like poop or sex jokes.But 2 stars ** for taking the attempt and falling!**** Isadore *********************"
1,Don't be fooled!,"The cover shows a cute, silly picture of a dog. I was expecting greeting card type goofy pictures and captions. The pictures were okay, the captions were tasteless, sick and far from funny. What a waste."
1,"all bark, no bite","nice try, but Bad Dog is barking up the wrong tree in trying to copy Jim Edgar's Bad Cat book. The humor is distinctly lower class, more puerile and scatological, far less funny. We all know cats rule and dogs drool, but did they have to prove it with this pitiful knock off?"
2,DVD == Used and scratched in middle,Gunnar Peterson Core Secrets: Full Body Challenge.I love the DVD material....I was disappointed to discover that itis scratched in the middle of the workout. It does continue on howeverI miss some of the routine. Didn't realize I was getting a used/damaged copy.
5,A Must Read for High School or College Students AND PARENTS!,"This book is an excellent resource for every student or parent. It should be read along with all the college viewbooks that highschool juniors and seniors spend hours paging through.It is not only an excellent resource if you have been victimized and need help, but if you are getting ready to go to college or are already in college-- you should prepare yourself. Studies indicate 75% of college women are victim to harassment. SEVENTY-FIVE PERCENT."
3,Dislike,"This plant it way too flimsy. If it is anywhere near the filter, the leaves/stems bend over and look ugly. There are much better plants out there."
1,Bubble Gum,"The experienced businessman/woman should pass on this one. The book is reminiscent of a required ""bubble gum"" text in a freshman level business course at a community college. I only wish the book had more pages so that it would make an even better paperweight."
1,Very weak and simplistic,"The so called real life examples are hardly ""real life"", rather more like the product of the simple minded imagination of a second tier turnaround guy. I would have liked to hear the tougher stories from Pate's career (i.e. get a tax refund and liquidate)."
2,Less than half the original mini-series,"The original series runs about 4 and a half hours (I taped it a couple years ago when a local station ran it). This tape is only about 2 hours long. With less than half the footage, this complex mystery will make absolutely no sense to you."
3,OK BUT AMATEURISH,"The origonal story from the same writer of THE MALTESE FALCON----though this a very much 1970s tv show/mini-series, not some 1930s/40s poverty row movie.this five hour tv movie would have been a better 90 minute poverty row movie, with its murder story, religious cult, and drug addiction. james coburn sobering up in the cult's building, after being drugged, has none of the mood of the 40s MURDER MY SWEET similar drug scene.This is a very pre-MIAMI VICE looking movie, when all tv movies had lousy, banal, photography; this mini-series, set in the 20s, has the mood and photography of a typical contemporary 1970s cop show, or maybe a MASTERPIECE THEATER episode.The actor who would later play Data on STAR TREK has a small part opposite jean simmmons. And part of this mini-series was filmed in rural Pennsylvania."
3,"Entertaining enough, ultimately forgettable","The story starts well. Brady Coyne is a very likeable character, as is his client-- the irascable Florence Gresham. The seeming suicide of George seems open-and-shut, but Florence keeps the pressure on Brady to come up with an answer other than suicide. The plot wanders a bit too much for me, with too many characters and details, and some unfortunately rather predictable elements."
1,The title says it all,"First World, ha! ha! ha!Yep! Mexico deserves to remain in the Third World where it belongs: mirred in poverty, with no future for its children, divided against itself, alienated from the rest of the world, with the army out of its barracks, with violence in every headline and blood spilling in every street just so Mr. Marcos can enlighten the Club Med-Left on the merits of armed revolution as opposed to mere burgeois elections. Thanks a lot! It's painfully obvious you don't live here, never read the man nor care at all about MY country!Mexico in the First World? HA! Who do they think they are!"
1,Light is very dim,"I was excited to get this thinking it would light up like the picture shows. Well I should know better than that. I bought the green jellyfish, and while it does light up, you can hardly see it unless it is pitch black outside, even then it does not light up the water at all and now my jelly is floating sideways. It does not even float upright."
1,Not what i expected...,"THE BLUE JELLY FISH PUTS OFF A LITTLE GLOW, THE PINK ONE GAVE NO GLOW AT ALL. DID NOT PROVIDE ANY LIGHTING AT ALL FOR MY POOL. I WISH I DID NOT PURCHASE ITEM. BOUGHT ANOTHER FLOATING POOL LIGHT, WHICH WAS 3X CHEAPER AND IT WORKED 10X BETTER."
1,Hygrometer is Worthless,"Purchased primarily for the hygrometer, but it doesn't come close to reading the humidity accurately and is always off by at least 30%-50%. It will display a percentage if you breath hard into it, otherwise it's always displaying ""lo%"" when the actual room humidity is around 45%. The time and temperature are accurate, but impossible to see at night without a backlight. I highly recommend the Honeywell TM005X instead of this item if you're looking for an accurate hygrometer."
1,Hyrgometer does not work - twice!,"It stinks. The first one I got showed more than 20% lower R.H. than a honeywell I was using. I tried the Salt Water test to calibrate, and it showed the Timex was 20% - 25% too low. Amazon sent me a replacement for free (nice of them). The replacement didn't work either. I'm sending back for a refund. Don't waste your time with this."
1,not what was shown,"we ordered several of these based on the description, we were disappointed and returned them, they did not perform as described and the numbers were difficult to see."
1,Don't like it,A big disappointment. It doesn't register humidity in the lower ranges. I bought at the same time as a La Crosse WS-9400U. The LaCrosse tells me 37%. The Timex tells me Lo. I won't be buying any more Timex hygrometers.
3,It's OK.,Kind of hard to see. You have to tilt it just right. But it does give accurate readings and the battery has really lasted a long time.
3,Not their best effort.,"The Blind Boys are probably my favorite gospel singers, but this effort lacks the driving spirit which marks most of their work. The arrangements are saccharine - and the production values are lacking - but still there is a charm to the album."
4,Practical and easy to digest information,"This is a great book if you're looking for ways to bring a group of people together and establish positive group dynamics. Whether you've had lots of experience in facilitating group sessions, or none, you'll find the ideas useful. The opening section highlights the pivotal role a facilitator has in ensuring groupwork is affective. The emphasis in the mode of presentation is to give participants the sense that what they contribute is worthwhile and that they can achieve - as a group and as individuals. There are sure to be activities to suit any group size, interest, ability and comfort level. The activities themselves are written in such a way as to encourage you to adapt them if they aren't exactly meeting your groups needs. Adapation and exploration of ideas is encouraged, with an emphasis on fun, participation and acceptance."
3,"Good on games, lacking on the rest","I was disappointed in this book. It becomes clear as you read it that it is written for an audience already familiar with the author's Project Adventure. Unfortunately this isn't made clear on the back cover or anywhere else. The first chapter advises telling the group about The Experiental Learning Curve, The Full Value Contract, and Challenge by Choice - but none of these are covered at all in this book - and worse still, the book doesn't even refer one to where one COULD find out about them, beyond a brief mention of another book (""Youth Leadership in Action"") on the last page of the book. Also, if you have a basic knowledge of leading experiential learning, then you will not learn anything from the irritatingly chatty introductory chapters of this book. Buy this book based on the games only."
4,Another Rohnke Winner!,This is another Karl Rohnke winner. If you work with experiential learning (either with kids or adults) this is a great book to have in your library. This book contains a lot of old activities as well as some new ones. As with a lot of experiential activities -- it's great to have the procedure written out. This book is well worth the price.
4,Great Upgrade If You Need It....,"This is a great upgrade over my previous Word & Excel 98. I got the Word and Excel upgrade, but got Power Point and Entourage (a mail and calendar program) free. But, frankly, I wouldn't upgrade if it weren't for my employer upgrading to Office XP.The programs have crashed a few times, but I recon that's an OS X (10.1.2) problem. Similar problems have happened elsewhere."
5,Matisse - cut paper design postcards,"What a great selection of Matisse cut paper work! I like that these postcards can be removed easily from the book for use, or display."
2,Check the content before you buy,"The book covers stage arrangement, some physics etc. Would have been better if it had more Advanced Tabla instructions, e.g., Bol, finger positions based on different Gharana's etc. Not worth the money."
3,Not Enough Meat & Potatoes.,"I'm an avid reader of all Astrology books, but this book seemed to be missing something. It attempts to give you the best way to maximize from your Jupiter potential, and it missed the mark. I found myself coming away wanting more; more examples of how it works, why it works, and if its not working for you now what can you do to manifest it. To me it did none of that."
1,Thicker Than Water,I regret buying this book. It stared off interestingly enough but most of characters were just there. I was disappointed that there were no real vampires and that it was just a role playing sub culture. The fact that the role playing was to taken to such an extreme seems a litte far fetched. Not one of the best books I have ever read.
1,Fake Vampires and Flat Characters,"The book starts off with an interesting enough premise, but all the build up goes no where fast. The book is driven by plot and the characters are merely 'there' and have no actual effect on the story or reader. A big let down. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
4,Great Earrings!,"These are great earrings! I was looking for black dangle earrings, and the onyx & beads give them style. They can be worn with casual or dress. They are solid and substantial, but not too heavy."
2,AWEFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,these earings are the worst! they are way too heavy and the rocks on the bottom weent the same color! on was grey and one was black! I dont recommend this!
3,half decent death/grind,"here's another band i never heard of and i've been in to death metal for 20 years.this band it good,not the best,but pretty damn good.they're worth a listen."
4,It was very good..very helpful,This book was very helpful...but I would like to learn how to construct effecient sentences...and to inunciate (pronounciate)the words write instead of going back and forthe to the vowels...
2,Helpful but full of mistakes,Although this pocketbook is helpful for beginners it has one big mistake: phrases and words are written in Amharic letters (which is a good thing) but the authors were really careless when they proofread the book. In many cases the word (or phrase) written in Amharic does not correspond to it's English translation ... which leads to misunderstandings as soon as one uses the book for nonverbal communication (and that was the idea behind the usage of amharic letters)!
1,Completely Useless!,"This guide is terrible if your goal is to speak Amharic. The Achilles heel of this book is that there are no accent marks on the ethiopian phrases. If you read what is in the book there is no way you will come close to saying anything intelligible. On the positive side, all of my Ethiopian friends found this book very helpful for learning English."
1,Phrasebook to speak Amharic like a foreigner,"This phrasebook has lots of useful grammatical information. However, many of the examples are literal translations of the English. The results are phrases that are not good or natural Amharic. Instead, they teach you how to sound like a foreigner. Though there is an Ethiopian listed as one of the authors, it is clear that he felt pressured to produce a prodcut that was close to the English."
3,OK book for those totally new to Amharic,"I bought this book with me the first time I ever went to Ethiopia. It actually wasn't very helpful to me in helping me speak Amharic and there were a lot of mistakes that were pointed out to me in the book. However the fact that the words are also written out in Amharic are most helpful because you can always point to the word if you have trouble and someone will be willing to help you pronunciate the correct word in Amharic. If you want to learn some very basic words then this book is good. However if you want to speak phrases or sentences, that book does not exist just yet. This book also does a good job of telling basic facts about the culture which was very helpful to me during my first trip to Ethiopia. Overall I'd say that it is a good book and was well worth my money. I would say that others also enjoyed this book because when I left Ethiopia I could not find my book ;-)"
3,"real good guitar, dunderhead drumbo","Real good guitar instrumentals but a rhythm section that has all the imagination of a drum machine programmed at level one. Playing hard on all the most obvious beats and never taking a risk on mixing it up a bit, it's a frustrating album to listen to. I dig the guitar, but the background just sounds retarded, chicken, lame. . . . One would think that a couple decades or more post-Hendrix Experience that this approach would be dead -- well, it is, on arrival. Like these dudes never heard Hoodoo Man Blues and know nothing about Freddie Below, Francis Clay, Sam Lay. Like I said, guitar's all right but the rhythm section is strictly wonder bread."
2,Jam vs Jazz,"Little too much jam and not enough Jazz but still good listening overall. Intended a three star review but edit doesn't let me change the ""star"" value."
1,Not what I thought it was,"Before I bought this CD, I listened to the samples and thought the CD was gonna be great. Turns out, that this CD is full of tunes that are so generic and repetitious that after the first minute of each song, you just get bored because it sounds as if the songs starts over again. Thackery doesn't really change the melody from one segment to the next and as a song progresses, it sounds as if he is running out of ideas. This is where things start to get right down dull and makes the CD a waste of money.Regardless of the great reviews this CD got, my opinion is that this CD deserves two thumbs down .... way down!"
2,Poor Copy,Very poor copy. I taped this same movie a few years ago and would have been better off making my own copy.
4,A fun book...,"Well, it took me a few days to finish this book, I wasn't really able to get into it all that much, but once I finished it I started to like it more and more! Thinking back on all the quirky, eccentric folks of Higby, Mississippi, I was a little disapointed there wasn't more to read.The book is about Labor Day weekend in the small town, and the going-ons in some of towns peoples lives. The chapters are real short (3-5 pages) and each focuses on a different person. There's Carmen, in love with the handsome Tie who doesn't know she exists...Stewie and Marci, who's relationship is tested, Pastor Cullen who's son Clint falls from the Higby water tower, both of whome are trying to move on after the loss of a wife and mother, and so many more!I recommend this book as a light fun little read. You'll really enjoy the craziness and quirky drama of the folks from Higby, Mississippi."
3,Kind of fun.,"This is a feel good story about a whole bunch of small town characters told in short rapid fire chapters. There is nothing special about the plot, and the characters certainly aren't deeply drawn. As light reading, I kind of liked the book. The characters are often fun, sometimes fresh, and it is fun how so many of the characters will appear, exit, and then re-appear some time later. It is multi-generational, and ranges over the entire middle class, even upper lower class! The book isn't mawkish, and fails only when attempting to meaningfully depict personality change (one partial exception being a lonely woman who meets her man). Let me confess that I stopped reading the biblical quotes which begin each chapter, and perhaps I did not properly appreciate the deeper significance of the work and its themes of salvation and redemption."
2,I MADE IT TO THE END!!,"So---so---so---many people to keep track of.The only decent one out of the whole lot was HANK.The rest of the folks were very iffy, at best.I wanted to stop quite a few times---but---kept going on.It was an okay read----not great---not terrible."
3,Disappointing,"Like another reviewer, I was looking forward to a book as clever and entertaining and unusual as ""Ella Minnow Pea"", which I adored.Instead, I found Dunn's new book to be silly, predictable, and rather ho-hum. It was a struggle to finish it and I forgot it within hours.The author parodies the residents of a small southern town - which might be okay if it had not been done a thousand times before (and better, too, I think). It just did not sit well with me....no matter what his/her flaws, all the characters were good underneath. I think Dunn may have been trying to make these characters as quirky as those in his first book, but it just did not work here.This may have succeeded as a novella or a short story, but as a 300+ page novel, it went on for far too long."
4,Makita's Battery Improvement,"Same drill as the one using Ni Cads, but the batteries and charger are a vast improvement."
3,Buy it for the batteries and charger,"The flashlight is okay (no diffuser for the beam), but the drill is crap. I bought it to get a new charger and two new batteries. If you have a good drill/driver and need some batteries and a charger, this is a good buy. I have a twenty year old Makita drill (jacob's chuck) that is better than the one in this ""anniversary edition."""
3,A time to watch,"This is a rare Niclas Cage movie not many people have seen this movie. The Itailians invade Ethiopia. Enrico Silverstri (Nicolas Cage). Enrico has a tooth ache and walks to find a dr. On his way he meets a good looking black woman. The woman dosen't understand whats hes saying to her. He rapes her then kills her.Enrico later feel bads and is trying his hardest to get out of Afica, back to his wife. I won't say to much, please watch this movie. Its good. Not all Nicolas Cage movies are going to be big at the box office."
3,A good little movie,"Great...no, but worth watching. The initial connection between Cage's character and Patrice-Flora Praxo's seems a bit odd given what happens when they first meet. The imporbability of this and Cage's somwhat mechanical delivery keeps me from rating the film higher. If you buy this I think the film works."
2,Nick Cage in a bad role,"Nicky Cage was not very good in this cinematic decomplishment, as he turns in a horrible acting job in this dull and boring movie"
2,what can I use to upgrade...???,"I have office 4.2.1 will this count as an upgrade???? I don't want to buy this and find out that it won't! I hate office, but love entourage and if I qualify for the upgrade, it's actually cheaper than buying entourage on its own!"
4,Excellent performance of 1968 band,"This is a particularly inspired outting for the 1968 band. This recording probably comes from their July 1968 European tour, but the CD doesn't give a specific date (and the CD does not correspond with any of the performances documented in Sheridan's COUNT BASIE: A BIO-DISCOGRAPHY). Compared with the Juan-les-Pins performance of July 23, the repertoire is similar but the performances here are better -- the rhythm section in particular is very spontaneous -- and the recording quality is above average (and stereo).Many tracks are misidentified: (2) is Blues for Ilean, (5) is Boone's Blues, (6) is Whirly-Bird, and (10) is a blues in C for the rhythm section -- 4 minutes of Basie's sparkling piano, in a playful mood.The sound quality isn't perfect (some distortion and shifting of stereo image), and there are many concert recordings -- but this is one of the best of the late 1960s."
4,Count Basie Blues Alley,"For starters, the title is incorrect. The track labeled ""Blues Alley"" is actually ""Blues for Ilene."" This cd is a hodgepodge of leftover takes from other basie performances. Some are Basie at Newport, and some, like ""Blues for Ilene"" are from the landmark engagement at the Sands hotel in Las Vegas. Sound quality is poor at times, but the cd offers an interesting glimpse into the band. I really like his version of Night in Tunisia."
4,This is an interesting CD,The Shiny Stockings and Splanky are bit different from the other CD but are very good. That is one of the good reason why this CD is a MUST BUY. The sound fidelity is excellent.
1,Banal Beyond Belief - Mickey Jones Home Movies,"I watched these today and was amazed at the unmitigated ego displayed by the [...] ex-dylan drummer Mickey Jones. It isn't that the pictures I saw were poor quality and out of focus, it was really all about Mickey Jones and a kind of boring travelogue that we watch when friends take a vacation - but this - just to use Dylan's name and The Band's name and see shadows of them as they fade in or out and what do we learn that most die hard Dylan fans don't know - nothing! [...] there are wonderful, interesting CDs and DVDs and books that are intellectually and emotionally stimulating and while they may not answer questions, they certainly provoke and disarm and display all the charm and hauteur and humor that Dylan possesses and projects. Just don't bother, please. [...]"
3,Meh!,"I was pretty excited about this after reading ""The Book"" by Alan Watts. Alan was an extremely smart man, and his contribution to philosophy will go on for ever. However, I just could not get into much of this book. I thought that it was going to be more of a journal that it turned out to be. With more personal prose I guess."
2,Stick with Tae Bo,"This was the WORST tape I've ever gotten! The Tae Bo Live Series and original Advanced tape are far better workouts and more comprehensive than this. I agree that the double-time is way too fast and you simply don't get a workout from this.Tracy is terrible. She is annoying, her moves are basic and boring (think beginner's jazz class with box steps and grapevines). I do not recommend this to anyone looking for a good workout.Stick with TAE BO!!"
1,BOOOOOooooooooo,"There is no fat blasting going on in the video whatsoever. This is the worst workout tape I have ever done. ""Master Blaster"" - which I thought would be a challenging strength and aerobic combo is acutally 30 minutes of upper body with weights. It was so easy I barely broke a sweat. The only lower body excercise was a couple of squats. There were fake breasts all over the tape, and when it was over I felt like I had wasted 30 min of my life. I had to do 2 more tapes after this one just to feel like I got a workout at all. very disappointing Billy! p.s. fat blaster plus was 30 min of floor aerobics. ok, some fun moves, but nothing special."
4,Not a bad workour for the price!,"My best friend and I used to workout to this tape when it first came out. You'll have to do Tracey York's section a few times to get the ball changes right, but overall once you get into it the workout is pretty good and it's fun. I am so glad that after all these years I was able to find the tape again! I did the workout yesterday for the first time in years and it was like I had never stopped doing it. We used to skip Billy Blanks because we thought his part of the workout was pretty lame, but I did it last night and it's not so bad. Once you get past the fact that Billy sounds like he is drunk and he doesn't really follow the exercises, the workout is pretty intense. Follow along with the women on the tape, and if you feel the intensity is not enough don't do the double time, just stay with singles and get your workout on!!!!"
1,this video,"Absolutely the worst video around! Where to begin...the tape is slow moving, boring and completely uninspiring. The background hooping and hollering is annoying, not to mention distracting. Billy Blanks offers suggestions on how your form should and should not look at exactly the same time when the camera is panning on one of the background exercisers. Plus, he likes to flex his muscles and say ""don't you want to look like this""? Blanks focuses only on the upper body. He only does one lower body exercise. The stretches are uninspiring. He gives little or no direction and periodically he likes to ask - how do you feel? The few times I have used the tape - I respond: ""Cheated!!!!""The Tracy York portion I have used once. While she tries to offer instructions, they are shotty at best. I ended up relying on her music and routines from my past exercise classes to use instead of hers. A complete waste of time. No sweat at all. But then, I am no fan of Crunch or of Billy Blanks"
3,I don't use this tape very often anymore.,"I use the aerobic section of this tape when I want to have a longer workout. I like Tracy York, and even though, it took me awhile to catch on to the routines, I enjoy this workout because it is low impact.As for Billy Blanks contribution to this video, I was extremely disappointed. First, the warmup is uncoordinated and secondly, when the camera should be on Billy while he's explaining what to do (or not to do) it's not. Finally, there are way too many participants in this class and because of that, it is hard to figure out who you should be following (when you can't see Billy)because they are not in sync and they are loud and distracting!"
2,"Billy is good, Tracy NOT","This tape is 2 workouts by 2 different people. First is Billy, who mostly does upper body work with handweights. He keeps mentioning to keep the stomach muscles tight throughout the workout, which I liked. His workout was easy to follow and do on a rug. The 2nd workout with Tracy is awful. I gave up trying to follow it. Forget about doing this on a rug because she includes slides & crossovers so you have to pivot your feet. The camera focuses on her upper torso so you miss the change in movements. I'll definitely buy another Billy tape, but will avoid anything with Tracy."
1,This tape was a waste of time and money!,"After doing TAEBO basics for about 2 months, I was really looking forward to this tape, wow, what a let-down. Billy Blanks did do a good job with the toning section of the video, my muscles felt like they really got a good workout. The aerobics portion was really bad. Tracy Yorks went too quickly, with little explanation of what was going on, and the camera angles were terrible. The video was more like learning difficult dance steps than working out."
1,What a Waste!!!,"This tape was a complete waste of money. The only reason I gave it 1 star was because I couldn't give it less. The toning section chose to work selective random muscle groups which you couldn't even follow, and the aerobics was (a) low impact for experienced exercisers, despite what they say; and (b) you couldn't even follow her ridiculous 1980's dance steps."
1,DON'T BUY!!,I thought this video was a DEFINITE waste of money! The first party with Billy Blanks is a good arm workout but the second party with Tracy Yorks was absolutely TERRIBLE! Not only is she impossible to follow but the workout was NOT fun and if you expect it to be anything like Tae Bo like I myself expected you are dead wrong!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,One of the WORST Vidoes available,"Very disappointing. Sickening actually, with the class doing one thing and Billy saying something else, every 6 seconds someone hoots or hollars, FOR GOD SAKE WOULD YOU JUST SHOW US THE MOVES AND SHUT UP ABOUT IT. Billy doesn't deliver much that's useful in this one. Steer clear!"
2,"What ""riot?""","Ok the first half of the video is from a rarely seen live concert from the '88 Suffer tour. The sound quality is poor , but it's still cool..HOWEVER..the supposed infamous riot footage on the second half is nothing more but 30 minutes of filming broken glass and firetrucks..we don't see the actual rioting at all...NONE....the movie package misleads by saying "" SEE THE RIOT IN IT'S ENTIRITY FROM FIRST BEER BOTTLE THROWN TO THE LAST , THE THROWING ROCKS , ect"" ...none of this is seen.we see the footage where the promotor shuts the show down because the fire marshall thought it was too overcrowded....but no actual rioting..just 30 minutes of boring footage of broken glass...what a waste of [money]....don't buy it ....don't waste your money....I only gave it 2 stars for the concert in the first half.."
1,"There is more ""Bad"" about this DVD than just Religion.","This DVD has VERY terrible sound and VERY low budget video footage. The only good thing is it has alot of songs, and the riot is somewhat interesting. Bad Religion is a good band, but this DVD is awful!! :(You will feel ripped off if you buy this!! Borrow it first, if you can, before buying it!!! I guess this DVD could always be used as an expensive cup coaster."
1,What were they thinking,"Picture yourself standing behind a pole watching a concert. You would have been better off that the view you get from this video. I can't believe the Bad Religion boys would put out junk like this. The audio and video quality is terrible, absolutely terrible.There are plenty of songs to see them perform live, but your only perspective is off the stage to the left with a tiny camera held in someones hand. Don't waste your money on this."
4,Great playlist...what could you expect?,"Early days...Pete Fineston on drums kit, Greg Hetson with long hair, a bit more hair on Greg Graffin's head and now-millionnaire Gurewitz dressed in Converge...THAT'S AWESOME! Now, about the music. Hard to believe Suffer was for once called 'the brand new album' from Bad Religion. Lots of songs are from that cd, plus earlier work like Frogger, Drastic Actions... Really great compilation. Graffin shows on earlier songs how unique and incredible lyricist he is. He should have been president, but eh...you can't always get what you want! And for those who are complaining about the sound, I think it adds some charm to the whole thing, plus, it's only punk rock right?"
3,What can I say?...it's Bad Religion,"It's freakin' Bad Religion. I like collecting stuff from great bands, so I don't mind so much the shaky camera and lackluster quality. It's also a historical event...the whole ""riot"" thing at what would have been a truly kickass show. If you want a great performance, I recommend the ""along the way"" dvd. 2nd would be the paladium dvd. for true fans, get the riot dvd. for intro to bad religion, get along the way.peace"
4,"Superb performance, poor picture quality","The bad part of this production is not the performance itself but the quality of the reproduction, sooo sad. Lucky enough, I have a 'Sharp' TY. It permits me to enhance the picture quality so that I could see the stage and the backgrounds.The good part is the performance of all actors vocally etc. If you an opera buff, like I am, this is a must, despite."
4,"Very good, nice gift...",These taste good and are a nice gift as the tin is nice and big. The chocolate coating was good but could have been a little thicker. The double dipped peanuts by Virginia Diner are better due to the thicker chocolate coating on them but these almonds are also very good. I would buy them again.
5,WHOLE CD IS GOOD,LIKED THESE GUYS WHEN THEY WORKED TOGETHER IN DAMN YANKEES SO I THOUGHT I'D GIVE THIS CD A LISTEN TO. EACH SONG IS DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ORIGINAL AND IT WINDS UP PRETTY GOOD.
4,Remembering Their Roots,Shaw/Blades did an excellent job of staying true to the spirit of these covers while still managing to put a new spin on them and make them feel contempory. It's obvious they have not forgotten where they came from or every one that came before them. A great album of classic songs which will never go out of style. I hope at some point they decide to do another one of these. Strong vocals with beautiful harmonies. A fun CD to listen and sing along with.
5,NICE SURPRISE,"DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT, I ORDERED THIS CAUSE WAS FAN OF THESE TWO ARTIST. I LOVE THIS CD AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM TO DO ANOTHER. LOVED THEIR VERSION OF ""I AM A ROCK"", AND ACOUPLE OF SONGS THAT I NEVER CARED FOR, I ACTUALLY LIKE THEIR VERSIONS. MAKES A NICE SUMMER CD."
4,Great sounding covers album,"Vocals, instrumentation, arrangements - for the most part, they're done spectacularly. Neither voice is showing any signs of age. And I didn't realize that Tommy Shaw was so skilled as a guitarist - he really shows off his chops here. Great song selections, as well.My only ""complaint"" is that they use the all-too-often misquoted lyric from ""California Dreaming"". They sing ""I got down on my knees, and I began to pray"" when they actual lyric is ""I pretend to pray,"" which really showcases the cynicism of the song."
2,Like Warm Decaf...,"I'll tell you what I like;Time of the Season 3Your Move (live version on VH-1 smokes the version on cd)3I Am A Rock 3Sound of Silence 3California Dreamin' (until distracting, loud, out of place guitar solo makes me fast forward or turn off)2.75I might put the songs above in my ipod but I most probably will never listen to the rest of this cd again. BUT...I still rock out to Cyclorama."
5,Some things just get better with time....,"I hadn't realized that Shaw and Blades were still recording together, but was extremely happy to find out that they were! Shaw's awe-inspiring guitar skills and Blades' smooth as honey vocals breathe new life into some of the best songs ever written. I actually think that they improved on Seals and Crofts 'Summer Breeze' and Orleans 'Dance With Me'. The one song that I would have loved to have heard them do after hearing 'Sound of Silence' and 'I am a Rock' is the 'The Boxer'.Both of these guys--especially Blades' vocals--just get better with time!"
4,Old songs made fresh again,"Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw complement each other so well. These guys sound awesome. If you enjoyed ""My Hallucination"", you will certainly enjoy this CD."
4,Pretty Damn Good,"I'm not a 60's guy, and I am not a covers type guy, but this CD is pretty damn good.The highlights for me are California Dreamin**, The Sound Of Silence*, Your Move, I Am A Rock & Dirty Work. The Carousel song is pretty bad( no one could save this yawner).As for the artists, Tommy Shaw and Jack Blades were made for each other. Apart they are both very good artists. Together they are tremendous. Here's hoping that in they future we can get a CD of original material from these two very underrated performers.This CD is very good. I highly reccommend it."
5,Good Music to listen and sing to!,Purchased Shaw-Blades for my husband as he travels alot on the road. He loves this group and is easy to listen to and to sing to!
5,Indispensable and done with love,"""Influences"" is remakes done right. Shaw/Blades take some classic songs to the next level by complementing them with their excellent vocals, tasteful guitar arrangements, and percussive thump. The songs are well known, yet feel new again with their updated structures. Some tempos are the same as the originals, while songs like ""For What it's Worth "" rock a little faster and tougher. Shaw and Blades have produced the BEST(rock) covers album to date. It's wonderful to hear these two (real) musicians pay homage to well known songs like ""California Dreamin"", while also reviving our memory of songs that fell through the cracks of time (""Dirty Work""). The playing is first rate, the harmonies soar, and as the title of my review says, this disc is indispensable. It's Grammy quality work...thaks for a great disc guys!"
1,They sound like a bad cover-band,"I heard them on Howard Stern and loved the acoustic versions of the songs. I thought that is what would be on the CD. Well, it's not. What is on the CD just sounds like watered down versions of the real songs. Also, it sounds like it was mixed poorly. Overall, a very bad album."
2,Disappointed - they tricked me,"I feel cheated in some way. I heard Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw on The Howard Stern Show playing ACOUSTIC versions of these songs. I liked the sound a lot. Then I bought the CD and found that none of the songs on the CD are acoustic at all.I'm a big Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw fan otherwise I wouldn't have purchased the CD at all, but these songs are really just cheap karaoke versions of great songs. Shaw-Blades bring nothing new to them. The sound is VERY watered down. Like Muzak in an elevator. My advice would be to just buy the original versions of these songs as performed by the original artists.I'll show mercy and give it two stars (which it doesn't deserve) because I did like California Dreamin' (although even with that one give me the original).Shame on you Shaw-Blades, are you really that hard up for money at this point in your career that you need to release a karaoke CD ?"
1,Stop It,Sounds bigger than it should. Way too much compression. All instruments and vocals pushed to the max. Mixed for IPods. I quess I'm an old guy.Louder in your face is not better.
4,great music for hip hop latino,I am a big fan of latin music from reggaeton to salsa. I love the mix of hip hop beats with latin music on this cd it is the best and would like to see more of Magic Juan.
3,mini cooper s borla 140035 exhuast,"generally product met expectations, it was missing a key gasket which cost $35 and one of the muffler hangers needed to be modfified to avoid contact with body"
2,cute but sizing is wayyy small,I am a very petite gal and ordered these in a small. They seemed to be made for a child. They are very cute but I had to return them. Returns were simple and easy.
5,David Ford is Awesome!,"David Ford is a very talented singer/songwriter, who is very inventive and I love all his albums. This one is an early one and has some slower songs on it, but very good!"
3,not what I thought...,"I am not sure what I was expecting...but this wasn't it. I don't know. Too clinical maybe, I just didn't really enjoy it. I am sure it will speak to many people.Heather mama of 5"
2,Okay I guess.,"Maybe Mrs. Jordan just isn't for me, but a lot of this just seems like political mumbojumbo. Basically, shes an advocate for home birthing, in the extreme, like, drive 50 miles out into the desert, set up a tent, and give childbirth that way. Who knows, maybe someone else got a better experience from this book."
3,"Interesting, but lacks in overall description","""Birth in Four Cultures,"" by Brigette Jordan was a required reading text for my class in Medical Anthropology. The book discusses the birthing practices of several different cultures, but Jordan describes some cultures more than others. The primary focus of the book is the women of the Yucatan, where Jordan did her field work. This part of the book is done very well, but the rest of the book is lacking. She did not have enough experience with the rest of the cultures to be able to write a strong comparison. While all four cultures were talked about, Sweden and the Yucatan were discussed the most and were the most interesting. If you are not familiar with birthing practices outside of the US, I suggest you read this book because you will be introduced to very different beliefs and practices."
4,Thought provoking,This book can really describe the difference between birth and childrearing practices in different cultures. Great for anyone looking to understand how much of birth is culturally driven!
4,Perfect for an ambitious little swimmer,"I bought this when my daughter was 16 months and this vest has grown with her. The vest fits snugly with adjustable straps around the waist and between the legs. Very durable, had mafe it through 2 summers so far. The best part is the neck flap that comes up to support the gead and neck while they are on their back. Good investment for us."
3,Not appropriate for kids,"I've done many of these puzzles and enjoy the mystery with the puzzle. However, the story with this puzzle had some inuendoes not appropriate for kids, mildly mimicking the various ""housewives"" tv shows."
5,This is the best acoustic guitar concert I've listened to,"In these two live performances Towner displays his great abilities as an interpreter and improviser. His tone is especially bright and clear, true to form he avoids the slurred arpeggiated sound that characterizes so much jazz guitar. Most of the compositions are his, two are not. His rendition of John Abercrombie's ""Ralph's Piano Waltz"" is wonderful, and short of hearing Miles Davis himself perform ""Nardis,"" you will not hear a better version anywhere by anyone else - ever. I can't recommend this CD enough. This is the best acoustic guitar concert I've ever heard. Buy this music, you will never regret this."
3,Dishonest Description,"First off, the title of this item is: Kraco R4002ABLK Black Premium Carpet Rubber Mat - 4 Piece. I only received the two front mats. In the second instance, the set is described as having a raised heel pad. There is no raised heel pad. Unfortunately, because I live outside the US, the cost of returning this would be so prohibitive that I simply won't bother. This probably won't make a difference anyway, because this item is out of stock and they'll probably remove it from their inventory along with my review.If it were properly described, it is actually not a bad carpet mat and I still may have considered it at that price. But the principle of the thing...."
3,Ok - not the best,"Pros:* Microsoft Office v. X for Mac had all the features I needed to accomplish what I needed to do.Cons:* Word tends to crash while I'm editing a document. Like today, it crashed 3 times already. It becomes frustrating when I forget to save and end up losing all my work.What I Wanted to Know Before I Bought This Product:* How often does the product I buy crash? Is it known to crash on users?"
4,Great Upgrade,"Each version of this product gets better and better, easy to use and easy correct almost like your english teacher is standing over your shoulder."
2,some retrograde moves,"I still use Office 98 for the Mac. Why ? Because the newer versions of Excel are retrograde. Valuable keystrokes (eg Apple-D to fill down) are gone. Yes, I agree that versions 9 and 10 of all Office applications have an improved ""appearance"", but WHY do they take OUT useful features for USERS ???? Newer versions are supposed to advance the effectiveness of the users. Did M$T forget this principle?"
4,Buy it for Sandra Wild Scene,"This is worth seeing just to see Sandra Wild in it, especially if you're a fan. The rest is mildly entertaining."
1,ok,"I was a disappointed with the uncessary filth that hollywood sticks in movies that might otherwise be a decent movie; the story line was a good one, acting was superb, but...."
1,Grill This Loser,"Time to review the 1992 crime drama ""Sunset Grill"" starring Peter Weller and Lori Sanger. The letterbox states, ""For years private eye Ryder Hart lived on the edge. Tonight he'll cross the line.""Well...Ryder (Weller) crosses the line and in the process we're all witnesses to one of the most boring crime flicks on Planet Earth.Peter Weller walks around for 90 minutes beat-up, bruised and bleeding like a mutt that's just been run over by a semi.Lori Sanger looks like a wax mannequin at Tussaud's House of Horrors and her acting could be recreated in any viable sound software program.Grill this one at sunset. I mean (to get to the point)...take the DVD and throw it into your barbecue grill as a flame starter.Peter, whom I admired prior to this embarrassment, is no longer a ""Weller"" in my book...he's now a ""Worser""."
5,best ever!!!!,Okay I have tried every product on the market!! Dont ask Im weird but also obsessed with finding the best product for my bleach fried hair first let me tell you that I have extremly tangly hair and most conditioners dont seem to even do the trick. However I tried this I got a sample with another purchase from beautysak.com well anyway Its the best my hair didnt feel course after using it which it usually does after any shampoo including Aveda and Pureology. i didnt even use a conditoner and OMG no tangles this is a miracle so i just ordered a liter.. HAHA you must try this its great!!!
4,ascent,"FOR AN OLDER VHS, THIS IS IN GOOD CONDITION. THE MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED, BUT INTERESTING"
4,I love Philips,"I don't have a AZ 7594 but I do have a AZ 7594. I love mine a lot. The 45 seconds esp really works and the quality of sound are smooth as well. But let me be honest the headphones are... too big and easy to fall off. But anyway, I still think this series is perfect for its price. If you think sonys and panasonics with esps are too expensive for you, you've got to try philips. Trust me. You'll like it."
5,It's good.,"I bought this same CD player for a friend about a year ago and paid close to $140 for it. I then ended up barrowing it a couple time and knew then that I got my money's worth. The best feature is the rechargable batteries, which last for a long time. The skip protection is great, the first thing that My Friend did when he opened it was plug it in, put in a CD and started shaking it very hard and there wern't any skips. When I put it in my car I don't even have to turn on the extra skip protection it is still skip free except over railroad tracks. Now it's time for me to buy a new CD player and this is the only one that I even considered buying, however I couldn't find it anywhere until I looked on Amazon.com. It's also forty dollars less than I paid for it a year ago, but it's worth much more."
4,Consulting,This book is great. I didn't even know what a consultant was before reading it. It has a bunch of really practical advice and words of insight from the author. I recommend it to anyone who is looking to lead any project whether that be a community garden or a fossil fuel manufacturing plant.
2,Not in agreement with other reviewers,"I read the first 40 pages to verify my initial reaction toward this book: namely, the author is pompous and patronizing to his audience. He treats his readers as though they have few brain cells. Moreover, he frequently mentions the word ""ego"" as if this is the primary reason why people enter consulting (i.e., to feed theirs). It's certainly not mine. After reading to page 40, I jumped ahead to Chapter 8, Establishing Fees, which provided useful information. I plan to move on to other books that are outside the box re: consulting...and that don't insult my intelligence."
3,Consulting,"This is a good book, but a little hard to read. His writing style is not for the average person. This book is more designed for someone who already has enough money to pay for everything up front to start your own business. It didn't give me much hope to want to start consulting on a part-time basis."
2,Unimpressed,"The book has a lot of detailed step by step information on how the author runs his consulting business; however, he comes across as a greedy egomaniac. I was unimpressed. One chapter in the book suggests developing passive income like writing books. I was upset that I bought this books to feed this man's ego and revenue stream. Consider the Patrick Lencioni book series instead."
3,More about starting a business than about consulting,"A well written book with lots of knowledge, good ideas and motivation. A lot of the info here, however, is applicable to starting any kind of business in the knowledge / info management industry, and it has been done better elsewhere. There is not much here on what a consultant actually does, what kind of tools consultants can use to do their jobs, how you can learn to translate the knowledge you currently posses into a consulting career, what you will do when you land your first client, and so on. The book is certainly helpful on some fronts, but it is not enough to get you started as a consultant.So, not a bad product, but the title is misleading and if you are looking for a single source that will explain the field of consulting, look elsewhere."
4,well organized,"good key pointers, quick and easy read, good layout. the section on office equipment is silly. but he has a few very good points that make the book worthy"
2,I don't understand why this is a highly rated book,"I didn't like the book. It doesn't have much to do with consulting. It is teaching about how to sell, how to register a company and similar pretty common stuff.The book is missing the consulting essentials - some tools, how to build and defend a workshop, some blueprint examples for different situations, approaches to strategic and ""tactical"" consulting respectively... In the same time it is handling some micro processes on a ""how to give a smile"" level and giving some advices as ""you should have a web site"". Wow. I just didn't find the value."
2,Very basic,"There's a great chapter on setting your fees based on value, rather than hourly rates. Its the only reason I kept the book. (Although if I had known that was the only worth this book contained for me, I would have bought Weiss's ""value based fees."")But hey -- if you don't already know that maybe you want a photocopier; or that clients are more impressed by good logos than by bad logos; or that you shouldn't go around working for free; then this is the book for you."
2,Needs Professional Editing,"I'm new to telecom and I needed a comprehensive but easy to read book. This wasn't a good choice.The book does have a good glossary. However, after the first few pages the authors suddenly start tossing around acronyms as if everyone innately understands them.But worse by far is that paragraphs are out of sequence. You have to figure out for yourself that the paragraph you are reading is related to three paragraphs back but not the immediately preceding paragraphs. I found this very distracting and unpleasant and I really wished the authors had invested in editing services. You can piece together the logic but you have to be a pretty brave soul to take on a new, technical subject, a rather dry one at that, with a book that isn't strong on logical editorial flow.I wouldn't recommend this book except perhaps to someone already familiar enough with the material that the literary weaknesses don't hinder study."
5,The great beginning...,"I started with Little Miss Sunshine and worked my way backward in DeVotchKa's discography. This album is a little different from their later work, with some musicians that are no longer with the band. But their unique sound started here, has carried on and become greater. Supermelodrama is more raucous, with more of an American indie-rock sound, but sets itself apart with violins, accordions, etc, and some cool guitars and beats. It's fun to hear, to sing, to dance to, and the lyrics are always great. I won't even bother comparing it, because it's unlike anything I'd ever heard before. There's not a bad song on the album."
4,"A great record, they have come a long way from this.","This was an incredible record. When I first started to listen I could barely recognize Nick Urata. This had a much more ""Rock"" feel to it as opposed to a more orchestral sounding arrangement in their more recent records. But this is great and any fan of DeVotcKa should add this to their collection."
1,Ouch!!!,"This one hurts. I loved Bombs Over Broadway and their self-titled release. I even enjoyed their old ska/punk styled albums, but this one is really a dissapointment. Now signed to Capitol, have Squad sold out? I asked Jeff, the lead singer of Squad, ""what happened to you guys, I listened to the album and it wasn't very good."" He said, and I quote, ""We tried mixing the Clash with the Stones, but listen to it, you'll get used to it. We had to listen to it a couple times before we liked it too.""Okay so if the band has to get used to their own stuff, I think we have a problem on hand."
5,DON'T LISTEN TO THE NAY SAYERS!!!,"This and all of their albums are great!!! Jeff and all the others are musical genius's, the ska/punk was what got me into them, and as i grew out of that so did they. Squad Five-O is a great band to have in your collection! So don't listen to the nay sayers, and buy this and all of their albums."
4,RIP,This ALBUM IS TIGHT. COPP IT.... and look out for MAC DRE as Andrea Macassi and MAC MALL as Mall Macanroe in DA US OPEN. MARCH 22nd !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dead but not forgotten!!!! THIZZ OR DIE!!!
4,For all mankind makes you feel joining the crew to the moon,Don't see for all mankind as a realistic documentary.If you buy for all mankind you'll notice after watching thefilm that you feel like you have really joined the crew travelling to the moon.That you have witnessed them from the moon when they made theirfirst walks and attempts to drive on the lonely surroundings.The images are quite well and sharp.It gives you a good insight in day to day activitiesas well as concerning the ground personnel as well aslive and spending time on board.
5,"Humans on the Moon, from the Astronauts Perspective.","We learn about the trials and tribulations of the rushed journey to get Humans on the Moon before the Soviets.As each Astronaut recollects his experience in the Gemini and or Apollo Projects, we are treated to clear film footage, both Color and B+W.Everything is exciting, from the scary spacewalks 300 miles above the Earth by the Gemini Crew to the color film of the Moon Buggy, to the installation of the American Flags on the Moon.The Music by Todd Rundgren, or is it Brian Eno, enhances the viewing experience.I have watched this DVD quite often and found something new everytime. This is a must see for all, and try to find the flying glove."
3,Awesome content almost overcomes NASA marketing,"I saw ""For All Mankind"" in its IMAX incarnation at the Smithsonian. I hate to be a party pooper, but it struck me as more a NASA marketing piece than the awesome piece of space trip I had expected. Admittedly, I am biassed, having seen Spaceborne many years ago. The latter was a short assembled from public-domain footage, and had a much more spontaneous, closer-to-the-moment feeling than ""For All Mankind"". Still, space footage is space footage: hard to screw it up, especially with a score by Brian Eno. If only Criterion had included Spaceborne (otherwise unavailable) on this disk."
1,ripped off,This disc will not play in an Australian blu ray player. It would have been nice if there was a warning on the US site.Darn
3,Looks more like a lavish promo for NASA than a documentary,"I guess it depends on how much footage of the Apollo missions you want to watch, but you get decidedly more viewing pleasure for the buck with the HBO series, From the Earth to the Moon - The Signature Edition, which also had unlimited access to NASA in making this documentary -- 720 minutes as opposed to 79 minutes plus whatever extras Criterion tossed in. For All Mankind is visually appealling but it doesn't give you anywhere near the depth of information that the HBO series provides, plus it loses much of its appeal on the small screen."
1,Criterion mutilation of a classic space journey experience!,...read the reviews with interest - but frankly I was gutted to discover that Criterion have 'mutilated' this superb doc by messing with the original score/arrangements.'Deep blue Day' by Brian Eno and intermittant musical inserts lasting only a view seconds (which previously transported the viewer away from the immediate scene with the Astronauts) have all been removed - the magic has been squeezed out of this classic piece of video/doc architecture by a company who have done the equivalent of a painting a moustache on a classic oil with a black felt tip pin!Please cure my depression with some info on how I can get my hands on the original classic version on DVD or VHS? (unmutilated)!Bill Andrews
3,Space Nerd History,"The Apollo program through the cameras the astronauts took with them, as well as through cameras in the control room at Houston. It's interesting, but in the process of finding a picture of the DVD cover, I came across another I'm going to have to find, called ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" from 2007 directed by Ron Howard. I suspect (especially from the trailer) that it is going to be better.This is mostly the raw film, with all its flaws, and you don't always know what you are looking at. Indeed, I spent a good bit of the time while they were on the moon trying to figure where the camera was that was taking the picture. It turns out they have mashed together several trips, and so while there were only two astronauts on the surface in Apollo 8 (or was that 9?), there were more later, and there were cameras on the rover (which trip had the rover and went up to a ridge at a considerable distance from the lander?), and all together this was pretty confusing. Interesting, but confusing."
4,Pretty but empty,"One day in the USA there will be a revolution in entertainment. At that time we'll discover how good it feels actually to use our brains for something other than passive, thoughtless goggling at spectacles. But until then we'll continue to get things like this. Very pretty pictures, potentially an amazing set of stories, reduced to ""wow, would you look at that"" cliches.This DVD is a melange of clips from Apollo VIII onwards, strung together as though it were all one disjointed mission. The footage itself is of course incredibly beautiful but there is a paucity of intellectual content. Very little information, less explanation of history and context, and ultimately it's junk food for the mind.With the footage available a really interesting and profound video could have been assembled. But until the revolution we'll just have to get along with this ""turn off your brain and open your mouth"" prettiness."
4,Fantastic record of manned space flight,"For All Mankind is a fantatic video and audio record of mankind's greatest achievement, landing men on the moon. Al Reinart has assembled actual NASA footage and astronaut descriptive comments in a truly engaging manner. One hundred years from now, this will be the lasting record of the Apollo Program."
5,Out of This World,"This is a must have for anyone with the dream to explore.This film looks AMAZING on Blu-Ray, You feel like you are there.Some of the WOW moments:- getting a sense of the size of the Saturn V from the elevator ride up and the view of the shadow it casts on the cape.- Liftoff.- The spacewalks. One from Apollo 8 (I believe) and another where a glove floats out.- The sheer acceleration during the TLI burn.- The Apollo 13 Audio when all the alarms were going.- The view of the lader from the command module.- Just about all the stuff on the surface of the moon.Even the paintings special feature was quite informative as it gave some insights into moments on the moon we may never have heard about.I can't recommend this disc highly enough - although the run time is only 80 minutes you will get your value out of it as you will want to watch it over and over again."
4,Good document but not for beginners,"It's a good collectible document for diehard Apollo fans, the sound and music is supperb. But it's no good for beginners - the film editting is very confusing, it mixed the original footages from different space programs and assembled them into one ""virtual"" mission, the subtitle and identifier are not helpful at all, sometimes even make it more confusing. I for one don't like this kind of compilation style. It should organize the footages in strict mission order and use the interview to link them together chronologically. If you're buying your first Apollo DVD, go for From the Earth to the Moon or Apollo 13."
3,"Has some great moments, hurt by confusing narrative.","""For All Mankind"" contains some amazing footage from the Apollo expeditions and narration from some of the astronauts. There are many great scenes, but the film as a whole suffers greatly from the fact that they've combined material from several different trips into one narrative and most of the time we're not sure what we're looking at or who's talking about which Apollo expedition. For me, this took out a lot of enjoyment of the movie, which is a pity because there are some great sequences. Personally, I liked the similar but more recentIn the Shadow of the Moonbetter than For All Mankind."
4,Go for the moon,"Apparently there are some historical inaccuracies in this movie. But I think if you take this DVD as more of a visual representation of the experience of exploring space and the moon then it is very good. It was very different from what I expected. having been a fan of the Eno record for almost 20 years, I expected it to be more contemplative. It starts out with JFK declaring that we are going to the moon and then proceeds to follow all the seps from preparation of the astronauts to the voyage and finally to langing on the moon and finally return to Earth. There are constant comments by the astronauts regarding space travel and their conversations with the control center. This I agree gives sometimes the false impression that we are watching a documentary. Brian Eno's music is discreetly in the background, more discreetly than I thought actually which is slightly disappointing."
1,Good headphones but not for noise canceling,"I rated these 1 star because they did not satisfy the reason I purchased them ... primarily to cancel out engine noise while flying. While they do give you decent sound from your music device, the open-ear design pretty much negates the noise canceling function. I have owned noise-canceling headphones before, Sony. These were closed ear design and did a much better job of canceling engine drone and other low frequencies, tho I had the same annoying problem with crackling and popping when I moved that everyone else seems to have experienced. Bottomline, do not purchase these if your goal is to reduce air travel noise."
1,Problem With Noise Cancellation Feature,"The only reason for my purchase of the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones was to cancel noise not listen to music, etc. The person that I purchased them for is writing a technical book and relative silence is an important part of the writing process. Unfortunately, the normal surrounding noise was not canceled and, therefore, it was necessary to return the headphones. Please note, the other features of the headphones appeared to be fine. As of 15 August I have not heard anything about a refund, but am confident that will be properly handled by Amazon. I have made several purchases from Amazon and until this one have always been very satisfied with them. I look forward to a continuing relationship."
1,Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. I'm not an audiophile or a technical expert on this item but I have good hearing, I know what I like and I'm totally satisfied with these noise cancelling headphones. They're easy to use, fold up neatly for travel and the noise cancellation is amazing.The active electronics are in a separate unit which also holds the batteries. This tends to mean the wires can get a little tangled but this is not a serious drawback. This is an excellent product. If I were to lose this headset, I'd buy the same model as a replacement."
5,No complaints,"I just bought these NC-headphones and I now wonder how I've flown without them all these years. I couldn't believe how loud I had been listening to my music and movies while flying. The noise cancellation takes away the low hum of the jet engines. I even slept better with them on (no music or movies...just the noise cancellation).They're light, comfortable and travel in a compact bag. So far, no complaints."
3,Not great for noise cancelling,"I bought it for a long plane trip. It seems noise cancelling headphones are great at reducing lower frequency noises. With the headphone, the roar of the jet engine is reduced, however, it reveals the annoying shrike of the wind noise which otherwise would be drowned out by the engine noise.The headphone make music sound fantastic. But, that wasn't why I bought it.I've had it for almost a year and after the first month I never used again.The setup is fairly cumbersome. It is not easy to sleep while using it since the wires and battery pack get in the way.I've found that a good pair of earplugs works better."
4,Adequate,"They are lightweight and compact. I have used them on airplane trips 4 times already. They do cancel some of the noise, but for those that haven't used this technology before, don't expect it to get quiet on a bus or plane. The main problems I have are the separate unit that contains the batteries is a little long to store/hide conveniently when in use and the two sets of wires easily get tangled. My wife has a $60 pair from another well known company, so I am not sure if these justify the higher price."
2,"Uncomfortable, awkward, noise cancelling just OK","I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Etymotic ER4 earbuds, which were a replacement for my Sony MDR-NC10 earbuds. Unfortunately, I found them much less comfortable than either the Etymotic or the Sony earbuds and no better at noise canceling.I have used headphones two hours every day for the past twelve years during my train commute. I have been through a long succession of iPods and portable FM radios. I have had a lot of time (too much really) to develop an opinion. I am sticking with the Etymotic earbuds.BTW, the Sony earbuds were great, but if you lose one of the rubber earpieces (like I did - twice) Sony dings you for about $40 for a replacement."
4,Excellent,"The headphones are great. Airplane travel is now much better. I also use my headphones in the office and at home.battery life is good. Headphones are light, well-built and performance is fantastic. Price is unbeatable...I think I paid $128..Compare that to the comparable $400 Bose model.I do not rate them 5 starts because of the separate baterry pack. This however is not a big deal, and actually does not bother me at all."
4,"Good value, good sound","The PXC 300 headphones sound good, and they are surprisingly effective at reducing ambient noise in airplanes, especially low frequencies. They are less sensitive than ear buds, and require a higher volume setting from the source to obtain a given sound level. That may reduce battery life in the source, but I haven't noticed significant change."
3,Bulky battery case is a bigger problem for me than illustrated by most review,I need to emphasize that the battery case really is a nuisance. So much so that I never use this headset when on the move and even sitting here in my office every time I turn or reach for something it comes skating across the desk or crashes to the ground.
5,Good product,My husband lost his Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones. He was very pleased with them and wanted to replace them but the price was too high. He researched other headphones and bought the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones. He liked their performance and price. I purchased two other sets for Christmas gifts and both recipients used them on recent flights and were amazed at how well they worked.
4,nice headset,"provides a nice noise reduction, though it is not completely cancelled. Also at low volume/there is a kind of white noise. But that's better than the noise that I need to be reduced. If there is no noise at all, noice cancellation produces deeper sounds compared to turning the cancellation off"
5,"excellent performance, excellent price",I bought these for my wife as a Christmas present. She normally travels using company provided Bose QC II but she was very impressed with the Sennheiser's performance and comfort. Her opinion is that they are as good as the Bose and more comfortable to boot. I have used them as well and I find their performance to be outstanding and they are very comfortable. Bose makes nice equipment but the cost/benefit analysis after comparing both products makes Sennheiser seem to be the clear winner.
3,Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones,"I work in a room with computer servers (loud fans). This product helps some, but not as much as I would have expected. Probably too much high frequency noise from the fans (noise cancellation works best on lower frequencies).This is a light and comfortable headset, but for my particular situation I would recommend a larger headset that does a better job of blocking out external noise by making a seal around the ear. The smaller headsets by design allow more external noise to be heard, which can be an advantage in certain situations.If listening to music, the quality is much better when the noise cancellation switch is on."
4,Great headphones,"Very comfortable to wear. While the noise cancelling mechanism is a bit awkward to deal with, the light weight of the headphones on your head does compensate for this design issue.The other major plus is that you do not look like a poseur wearing egregiously overprised Bose headphones (I call them Pose headphones)."
4,"excellent, all the way around","great headphones, especially for travelling. they sound great and the noise cancelling unit is relatively small, so they are not a big pain to carry around in normal circumstances, but they really shine on the train or plane, where the noise cancelling feature makes a big difference."
3,Couldn't get over the hiss!,"I purchased this item for my travels and also purchased the Bose since I read all the reviews and I couldn't make up my mind. Although the Senns are lighter, less expensive and more portable I frankly couldn't get over the fact that the Senns have a very audible hiss when u turn them on. On a plane it isn't that noticeable but compared to the Bose's the Sens just didn't do it for me. If you don't have the $ for the Bose's then definitely get them since when watching movies and listening to music on a plane, I totally forgot I was on a plane the sound was so good. If Sennheiser can get rid of that hiss, I'm all over them."
2,Not as good as I expected,Pro:It does eliminate the fan noise from the desktop computer. That's all it can.Con:It has its own low freq. noise when the cancel. is not activated.
3,Somewhat dissapointed,"I also own the PXC 250 (for six years now) and the PX-100 (not noise cancellation). My biggest problem with the 300 is the complete lack of bass. When Sennheiser ""improved"" these they boosted the highs and midrange. However, they completely ignored the bottom end. The 250 has good highs and much better bass. Of course, neither the 250 nor the 300 can compete bass wise against the 100. If you are looking to purchase the NC from Sennheiser, get the 250. They are also a lot cheaper."
3,Wonderful headphones... except they broke after a month,"I used these in a noisy cubicle environment and was very impressed at how it blocked out people's voices and ambient noise. They don't quite cover your entire ear but pretty close. The cords are nice and sturdy which was great (the Panasonic noise-canceling earbuds i got had very flimsy cords which caused a wiring malfunction).BUT. After 1 month of daily use and being very ginger with my $220 purchase, I turned on the noise canceling one day and there was a loud, and eventually tortuous, static sound coming from one headphone. With the feature turned off it didn't happen. I returned them hoping for a replacement but I got a refund instead. I may try the similar PXC 250's which were very highly ranked by Consumer Reports. I'm keeping all the original packaging and invoice just in case!!!"
3,"Stick with Bose, these are more compact but not impressive","I've been using the Bose Quiet II headphones for about three years. They are pretty good but after a while on a plane you feel like your brains are being sucked out of your head from the suction and if you fall asleep on the plane and roll your head you are reminded that they are on. Additionally they take up a lot of space to carry in its case. Soooo, I bought a pair of the Sennheiser PXC 300 headphones after reading the reviews. One thing is true, they do take up less space in their case. They don't, however, do as good a job cancelling out the noise. I found myself holding the ear pieces close to my ears to make it easier to hear over the engine noise. It was nice not having the suction feeling of an over the ears headphone but I got them for noise cancelling and they really didn't work very well."
4,Sennheiser works well but not perfect,"I liked the reviews for the Sennheiser PXC 300. It performs as discribed. I used it on a long flight of three hours and found some pressure on the ears, but not too uncomfortable. The extra module hanging down or clipped to my shirt did not bother me. The sound is great. There is no volume control with the earphones, so to control the volume one must use the player's volume control. The earphones will work with or without the noise cancelling turned on and the volume increases when the switch is turned on. I could still talk and hear normal talking, but it did cancel the annoying roar. The cord is long enough to use for the device to be off the the side, but an extension is needed to listen to the TV so that others are not disturbed. Overall I am pleased with the purchase."
3,"Let's define ""noise cancelling""","Noise cancelling means it will cancel background noise (i.e. white noise, fans, plane engine noise). However it will not cut out loud TV, screaming children or normal conversation. For me engine noise is preferable to crying babies on a plane; noise cancelling headsets do nothing for that. The PXC300 are a nice set of headphones, comfortable, not too heavy, great tone. Keep in mind that the headsets are wired to the battery holder (and I assume pickup microphone), which then plugs into your device. So you've got some tangle opportunities there. My ""3 star"" rating is for the noise cancelling aspect. Otherwise they beat the equivalent BOSE model hands down."
2,"decent while they lasted, but poorly built","I enjoyed these headphones for the noise cancellation on long flights, but they are made of cheap plastic and did not hold up well over time. After one year, the the pretty silver pieces on the backs of the earcups came off. A few months later, one of the tiny plastic tabs holding the battery cover in place broke off, so I had to tape the battery case shut. And a few months after that, the rubber insulation pulled away from the jack at the joint, exposing the wires. I wrapped the frayed joint with electrical tape to keep them working a while longer, but on my last flight they finally stopped transmitting sound. The noise reduction still works, but who cares? For the price, they should be made with better materials."
3,Babylon,"This is a good overview of a biblical/prophetic subject on end-time Babylon. A good resource to have, but not to be described as detailed. Easy to read and digest."
3,Hard to understand,"I am reading Mr. Hitchcock's book and I am confused. The USA has invaded Iraq and gotten rid of the bad people. How can the Antichrist come to power, then? I do not think this is right. President Bush says we are establishing Democracy in Iraq. I think that there must be another Babylon."
5,What does the Bible say?,"Anyone reading this, how often do you read your bible. How heavy is the cross you pick up daily in your christian walk? Do you know what that means? WAKE UP. Our fair and balanced land is the Beast you obsess over blindly. We are the return of Babylon. the evidence is everywhere around us. Our lovable liar of a leader is the final antichrist, but you love him too much for that to even be a possibility for you. Our planet is on it's death bed, we have brought it this far. Wake up."
3,so so,"it was ok, not as good as some of his other stuff. Probably wouldn't buy it as a an intro to martin joseph. being a fan however, I had to have it"
2,"A yes, B no.","The .a half of this thing works just fine. I have an Netgear HE102 (.a only AP) and it seems comparable in performance.However the .b side is completely worthless. WEP or not, Netgear, Toshiba and other client adapters, all the same. No range, instable connection. Tried latest firmware, nada. Tried a pair of the WAB102's with same results. Steer clear of this thing. Get the HE102, or something better if you need .a, and get a $... special out of the sunday paper for your .b/.g needs."
1,Stay clear of this unit,"This unit works on 802.11a only, the 802.11b barely functions, if at all. Unit is constantly locking up, but could not get Netgear to issue an RMA. Tech support was not helpful, definately overseas with a language barrier. I would not recommend this unit or Netgear as a company."
3,Good TV but Poor Features,"This TV has great picture quality but unfortunately it lacks many features like no signal strength meter to help you in aiming your antenna for receiving OTA HD stations, no QAM tuner for most of us in the 21st century this means that you have to have a set top box in order to receive digital cable, no auto source select this means that you have to keep pressing the source button several times just to switch from one device to the next and this can be a bit of a pain as you can have 6 devices hooked up simultaneously. I would suggest if your going to buy this TV and want to watch OTA HD as well as QAM buy the Samsung DTB-H260F digital hd receiver and you will be quite pleased."
4,I can not understand...,"...what the fuss is all about with this Rypdal cd. The guys at Penguin jazz book gave it ONE star (!). I mean, there has to be ton of worst jazz cds than this!! They say it is jazz fusion but i disagree. It sure has some rock riffs here and there but mostly this is soaring free jazz rock in a style very much like many other Rypdal ECM cds. This one is filled with energy and fire but also a few jazzy (even pulling the acoustic bass out a few times) numbers balance the album for a very nice listening. Give it a try and decide for yourself!"
4,Golden and Etehereal,"I purchased this CD while on hiatus in Raleigh, NC, back in June,'91. Terje has had an impact on me since 'After the Rain,' which I purchased on vinyl in '75 while attending Michigan State. His gentle textures have mesmerized me to this day. This CD is more than passable, with Ornen and the beatuifully short and sweet Transition being among his most gorgeous work to date. Some of the songs are simply acceptable, but Ambiguity gets it off to a raucus, chaotic start...setting the mood for Ornen later. Well worth a listen or buy."
2,The worst Rypdal disc by far!,"I've always been of an opinion that Terje Rypdal is a much better backing guitarist in other people's bands than he is a leader and a composer.His compositions on the ""Chaser"" disc are chaotic and completely lacking any kind of substance. I could hardly get to the end of the CD. I was bored to death.In general, the drummer Audun Kleive did a hell of lot better job than the leader.BTW, I recommend another disc with Rypdal on a guitar: ""Nordic Quartet"" where he plays with SURMAN, KROG and STORAS. If you like a bit more serious Euro-jazz, listen to ""Litania"" by TOMASZ STANKO. Terje has a couple of great moments on that record."
2,bicycle board games,The game has great graphics but cheats like no body's business. Just when you are ahead the computer will make you loose. It will always roll whatever number on the dice it needs and you can bet the bank you won't. It also has some minor problems that cause some irratation. The old man will say gross things if you are playing as the little girl. I felt the need to turn off the sound it was so gross.
2,Cheats like a son of a gun,"Graphics are great, but the game cheats. It is amazing, you are close to winning and all of a sudden it starts rolling double sixes, while you get double ones (in Batgammon)"
4,Locks up on Windows 7,I have this game and it does not run on Windows 7 and has not been updated for Vista. It will run on Vista but you have to force it a little. We love these games are disapointed that when we updated our operating system the games quit working and lock up our computer.
1,Rating on Chess Only,"The chess game has 3 levels of play including a ""random"" selection on which level the game plays at. Thing is I haven't noticed a bit of difference in the level of play and the programming is really bad. The game will make the same moves over and over. Another thing, if I can beat any chess game at ""Expert"" the game is really really bad. Too bad the CD itself wasn't good for something."
1,No AI at all,"This game has no AI at all. sure the dice can be ran through a ramdom number generator on the cross and circles games but not really. What I mean is no matter how many new games you start you always seem to be the last one out of the gate while the other players are well past the start. You would think with an AI it would be like a man that has stragity, but its really if 'x' ='s Y, then it shows you z. For all the possible rolls it says you must have this. Not only does this happen on cross and circles, but on the backgammon board as well. No matter what you roll the computer player always gets a higher number and starts first. Real life my a$$.This of course goes for the chess game as well. Except maybe for random settings; it is possible to memorize the settings as the program only moves a certian way once you do it. Memorize the moves in chess and you can win every time."
1,Full of Bugs,I'm sorry I had to give this game even one star. This game package is so full of programming bugs that it is ridiculous. Don't waste your money. Go buy another game package.
4,Fastinating trip through early Florida,"If you thought that the only thing that the Spanish explorers did was pick up gold and enslave the natives, this book is for you. Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca was truly a modern man in the way he thought about people and things. Given only his wits having lost his clothes & food, he survives in a strange land for 10 years and walks out a reviered man among the natives. I had no idea anyone had done this. Our only regret is that he did not write more of his adventures and the socialogy & language of the people he lived with. Alvar Nunez Cabeza De Vaca had more than the usual dose of Duty, Honor and Country about him, and he kept all three when adversity struck."
5,Simply brilliant,"Allow yourself to fall under the spell of Gardiner's opening pages and you won't leave until the story is done. The book is wise, at times shocking, never less than elegant ... compelling storytelling, compulsively readable."
2,"Morally satisfying, but no more","I finished this book in a foul mood, which I eventually managed to atribute to a simple cause: lack of passion. The book simply--to my mind--has no life. The characters (with a few minor exceptions) seem trapped by expectations. I grant you it's set in a repressed time, but still, I was hoping, until the bitter end, for a flash of life. Somewhere.And I am not a romance reader, so that's not what I was looking for.... Just a small spark of life.A pretty disappointing read, in my view."
2,A Disappointment,"As I read these other reviews I'm curious if they were reading the same book that I read. I gave it 2 stars only because I have read worse books. That is not to say that the information in the book is not interesting, or heartfelt, but I just feel poorly written. Dirlam repeats herself in many useless issues, such as the numerous times that she metions the reavealing dress of the russian girls. The book is also a bit scattered, it did not flow well. I would recomend against purchasing this book, rather for an excellent book on siberia read Colin Thurbron's ""In Siberia"" it will delight and amaze you."
3,Jewish Autonomous Region: who knew?,"I didn't that's for sure. Intrigued, I ordered this book from Amazon.Sharon Dirlam's report of the two years she and her husband, John McCafferty, spent in Russia's far east is interesting and informative. The time is during the 1990s, so it may be a bit outdated. The personal ways of the Russians I'm sure are not. The book is very much like a long letter assembled from a daily diary. Ms Dirlam is extremely observant, generous and fair. It is a good sample of writing by a Peace Corps volunteer.The book is a self published low budget production, lacking in photographs except for those on the cover. The binding is poor and my copy began to disintegrate by the time I got to page 20.I don't think it is appropriate for spouses of authors to write 5 star reviews of their wives books though. It indicates a lack of objectivity and smells of desperation.The book is worth reading for content and perspective, but most assuredly is not a 5 star production."
3,Take your time with this one!,"A very interesting portrayal of John's life with Jesus and the years A.D., yet very believable. The only issue I had with the book is that it moved a wee bit too slow for my liking ...I struggled to finish it."
3,Not a helpful review at this point,"I have all 13 books of the Left Behind series, which I am still reading. I bought The Jesus Chronicles, ""John's Story"" plus the other three Matthew, Mark, and Luke's Story based on how much I enjoy reading the Left Behind series. I can't seem to put those books down, reading well into the night and early morning hours. I now wish I had read some of the reviews before I bought The Jesus Chronicles. I may not have been so eager to buy them. I can only hope that I am not as disappointed in this book as others have been.As far as the condition of the books.... They arrived without delay and were in excellent condition. I couldn't even tell that they had been read. Since I was buying several books I tried to buy more than one from the same place to see if I could save on s&h; but I'm not sure there is a difference ordering that way (I didn't verify).I rated the book three stars but will change it once I read it."
4,"Great read, Rotten price point","I enjoyed this book and would say the first person perspective brought it to life for me. I own it in soft cover but would NEVER buy it in Kindle edition. Until authors understand that they can't rape the readers by charging a physical book price for an electronic edition we're going to have a problem. Go back to the $9.99 standard for a new release and something like this, which has been out for quite a while in pysical edition, offer it for perhaps $4.99. I'd buy at that price point but not for $11.99. Take heed Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Lahaye!"
1,"It didn't seem possible, but WORSE than Left Behind","This book seems as though it's only point in being written was as an argument for Amazon to enable 0 star voting. Please do yourself a favor and don't read this, read The Last Disciple by Hanegraaf instead, or use a random number generator to pick an ISBN at random and read the related book - I guarantee it will be better."
3,My idea of a good story,I have read the entire Left Behind series and found it to be interesting and a good read. I was hoping that the Jesus Chronicals would be the same. I was not disapointed and have throughly enjoy the 2 books of the four that I have read. I would recommend this series to anybody who can enjoy a good story but look at the story as just a story and not a religious fact. This is only 2 people interpretation and not based totally on the religion that you prefer to attend.I would recommend the series to anyone.
3,John's Story,"This book may have shortcomings, but its value is found in the historical context which it provides to its readers. Most modern day preachers and teachers take John's books out of context. They have no concept of why John was inspired to write his books. After reading this book, a person will have a better understanding of the spiritual context of John's books. Once one knows the historical implication and intent, then one can make the proper spiritual application."
1,Couldn't even finish this one,"I totally agree with the other one star reviewers. I only fought part-way through the book before I pushed it aside in disgust. While a fiction work, the main character is supposed to give you a sense of who John was. The book portrays him as a hot-headed legalistic old man, quick to anger, cowardly, and needing to be led by those he had mentored. Where are his fruits of the Spirit? Where is the wisdom he would have from walking with the Master all those years? The words he spoke in the book were drivel. If you want a good fiction book to read (sorry I can't vouch for the historical accuracy) try Francine Rivers Mark of the Lion series. It's a three part series. I highly recommend the first two books."
4,I am enjoying reading this book.,I haven't quite finished it yet but I have been pleasantly surprised so far. I love how they kind of let you see things through John's eyes how it may have been for him back then. They take what they know from history and of course add conversations and things they think might have taken place to make it a novel. It's fun and easy to read. The only thing I don't like is that the last part of the book seems to be the books he wrote straight from the Bible which takes up a lot of space. I understand that's the whole point of the book but it's almost like I got tricked into thinking the book was longer than what it is. Other than that I would definately recommend this book. I really do enjoy reading it! I plan to buy them all!
5,John's Story: The Last Eyewitness,Couldn't have been a better account of the happenings back then...just loved it...thanks!
5,it's a must have book next to ur bible...,its a great book. can't wait to read the other 2books. this is as important as the bible its self ...
5,WOW John's Story is the Best,John's Story is awesome! It is the best book. I read it and immediately ordered the other 3 in the series. LaHaye and Jenkins hold to both Biblical and historical accounts while adding enough to build the characters and setting. An easy read. I couldn't put the book down. I recommend this book to everyone!!!
5,Mixing historical with fictional fill-in interesting,"Book of John is my favorite of the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's ministry on earth. I like the mix of what is historically known about the apostle John with the fictional story to fill in and make an interesting read. Then The Gospel of John and the 3 Epistles written by John are also included at the end of the book.Have also read the other ""Jesus Chronicles"" by same authors about Matthew, Mark, and Luke. I recommend all of them.Love being able to download books to the Kindle App on my Toshiba Thrive Tablet."
2,John's Story,Good book for those who haven't read the book of John in the Bible. I found the book to move very slowly.
5,love this book,this is a 4 book series so far have read 2 of them just finish johns story read the book in a week could not put the book down they are a wonderfull way to read some of the new testament but in a simple way for you to understand it i have just ordered book number 3 and will order the 4th series if you love the lord it is a wonderfull way to expirence it
1,HORRIBLE,"First, understand that I am a fan of the Left Behind series. I found it a little long (I mean really, 12 books? C'mon) but it was compelling overall.I looked forward to what LaHaye and Jenkins would do with the Gospels. Well....they've done nothing. NOTHING. Nada. Zip. Zilch. There's almost no background of John, his associates in later life, his time with Jesus, nothing. All they've done is basically taken dictation from John word for word, with a little tension thrown in. This is the biggest money grab I've seen in a long time. These two are capitalizing on their fame by scamming fans. They should be ashamed.Save yourself some time and money. Buy a Bible. Read the Gospel of John (and everything else in it, for that matter). It's better than this book can ever hope to be."
2,disappointing,"I've read all the Left Behind books, and have to agree with the other reviewers here. This book was a real disappointment. They make John sound more like an Earl in England than a person in Rome 95 AD. There appears to be a great deal of ""poetic license"" taken in this book, and unfortunately, it is not that entertaining or insightful. ZZZZzzzzzzz."
4,MCSA Self -Paced Training Kit Windows 2000 Core Requirement,"I am enjoying these books. Some of my clients are upgrading to Win 2000 and their main concern is security. I have found that these books are helpful for me, as well as preparing me for the exams. I hope it will work well for you as it is already for me."
2,Another MS Press failure,"The only thing MS Press may publish that are any good are the Resource Kits. Packed with more information than you will ever need and will more than likely forget.This MCSA kit, on the other hand, lacks just about everything when it comes to detail and how-to. Don't be fooled by the cover. It's nothing but a chopped up version of all their other self-paced training garbage.How other publishers can stuff their books with tons of USEFUL information and Microsoft can't is beyond me.If you want to ""build the skills"" to do anything, look somewhere else."
1,Don't expect to pass the exam!!,"I have read the first book out of the four (Windows 2000 Professional (70-210). Studied it inside and out. Took the sample test in the CD-ROM and got 98% on it. I thought I was ready for the exam so I went and took the 70-210 exam. Well, this book did not even come close to what the exam was like. The questions were much, much harder and longer scenerio type. I did not pass the exam. If you are looking to just learn Windows 2000 Professional really well, then these books are good. If you are looking to take the MCSA or MCSE exams then don't count on these books to help you pass."
3,"BEAUTIFUL, BUT TOO SMALL","I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE FULL SIZED BOOK OF ""VOICES"". WHILE THE MESSAGES ARE STILL WONDERFUL, THE ART WORK/COLLAGES ARE GREATLY DIMINISHED BY THIS SMALLER FORM OF THE BOOK. BUT, IT'S BETTER THAT NOTHING."
1,Only the original artist.,"I listened to my Mel McDaniels tapes for years and wanted to upgrade to CD, But these sound nothing like the original songs."
5,Awesome!,These tweezers are great! I have a pair for my purse and one for my bathroom! I given them away for gifts too!
5,The CADILLAC of Tweezers,"These tweezers are the BOMB! They are sharp and precise and grip even the shortest, most stubborn hairs and pluck them cleanly out. I threw all my other tweezers away and will only use Tweezerman. They are the BEST!"
5,The best,"By far the best tweezer I have ever used. It's not hard to grip any hair at all. Had mine for about a year now, and the only problem I ever have is trying to get my boyfriend to not steal it from me. Also, the ""Green Tea"" color is really cute!"
3,Tweezerman quality in a small package.,"The Mini is great for carrying around in your purse or for travel. However, the small size makes it harder to pinch/tweeze. You end up moving your hand further down towards the tips and if you have larger hands your fingers might partially obstruct your view of what you're trying to tweeze.The tube the mini comes in is more stable at this size, don't crack or split as easily and the tops don't pop out like the regular-sized ones do. So your Mini will stay in its tube and not scratch up other items in your makeup bag.Overall I prefer the Petite size ones (the size between the Regular and the Mini) which still handle as well as the regular-sized ones."
1,Defective Purchase,The tweezer heads didn't align and couldn't grip anything. Will probably think twice about buying tweezers before I can make sure they close correctly.
4,Work Great,Great item as expected from Tweezerman. My only complaint is that they are smaller than normal size and I have large hands.
1,Don't waste your money,Usually I feel safe buying Tweezerman brand. These feel like some generic knock off - they don't work well and are super stiff to use. I had to go buy a new pair at the beauty supply!
4,So far so good,"I bought this to pull cactus needles out of my body in case I should take a digger while riding my mountain bike. Fortunately, no need for that yet, but I did ride through a cactus patch and had to extract tons of small needles from my tire. These worked great for doing that small detailed grabbing. Really happy so far. Hopefully I'll never need them to remove cactus needles from my person..."
3,Now You've Got a Little Pull,Very convenient.Comes in a carrying tube.Good for trips.Well made.Still need to squeeze tight when pulling out a hair.
5,Needless to purchase anything else.,"Tweezerman is the leader in the field for a reason. These bad boys are super sharp and extremely efficient, and make eyebrow upkeep a breeze. Don't waste your time looking at anything else, these are the perfect purchase, and the mini size is great for travel and carrying around in my to-go makeup bag!"
4,ok product,"good emergency/travel option, def wouldn't recommend as your main tweezer though. Not as sharp as it used to be, it's been 2 yrs now i think?"
2,not happy,"This tool comes wtih it's own plastic case, which helps for carrying in purses. However, it doesn't work very well. Many times it misses hairs, especially the lighter, thinner ones and it's also not nearly as comfortable to use as a regular-sized pair of tweezers."
5,The only brand I will use!,Tweezerman is the only brand of tweezers I will ever use. I have tried many others and they just don't work! These tweezers are very precise for even the smallest hair. I have always used the mini version to save money-I don't feel the need to get the full size. Buy these and don't waste your money on another brand!
5,It plucks and pulls,"Did it really need to do anything else? Plus, it's made in India!Affordable and serves its purpose. Will purchase again."
5,Integrated Marketing for Nonprofits,This book shows strategies for fundraising and investment in this new world moving towards partnership donation based on social enterprise. Explains the new order and the shifts in activity and thinking required to be successful in the future.
5,This book will transform your work!,"Kay Sprinkel Grace is a wonderfully warm person whose personal mission is to help others develop their non-profit organizations to make the world a little better.This book will help any development professional tie it all together is an easy to understand way. It will also be useful to organization volunteers who are affiliated with your organizations, particularly members of your board of directors."
2,Book received with no cover,I received the book in pretty good condition however it did not have the cover on it which was disappointing because in the picture it had the cover. I am not sure if there is any way to get the cover however if so I would like to have it. Thank you!
1,B-movie!,"A lot of cable stations play substandard flicks like this when they don't show the good stuff. This movie has the predictable chase scene, the predictible kidnapping, and the predictible boudoir action. If you loved seeing Michael Rooker and his basement in ""Mallrats,"" you'll like seeing him and his basement here. This time, he has cranial hair and it looks great on him. Don't get me wrong: some will like this flick. Still, many will see that it's the same ol', same ol'. It is just basically nothing to write home about. It's not despicable, but it's not praiseworthy either."
5,Pat's Whores,"The author brings the reader into a very real and touching subject along with both humor and candor. When I got to the last page, I found myself not wanting the story to end!"
3,okay,"This is a good novel. There really isn't much in the plot. It's more of a character study. The book focuses on Pat, an aging rent owner and his difficulties with renting in a ghetto and his nagging family. The family includes colorful characters like Marty, the obsessive lawyer and especially Harry, a beach bum into all of these New Age type things. The main reason to read this book though is for the relationship between Reggie and Pat, which doesn't try to be sentimental but is touching anyway."
5,Awesome movie!,"This is a wonderful classic Disney movie. Love, love, love it! My 7 year old girl and 3 year old boy both love it too. The quality of the DVD was great and we will enjoy this movie over and over again. It has a great message and tells the story of history as only Disney can do. I highly recommend this movie for the great story and got exactly what I expected upon purchasing it!"
5,Cattle Wagon Fun,My son plays with this each day and he interchanges the animals (Brio Animal Set) so each one can have a ride. It has been fun to watch him learn through play and Brio train additions are the BEST!
3,Tiny bag,"This bag is plenty warm (in fact, too warm for any indoor use) but it's also small, my daughter is a small 4 year old and can barely pull this over her head. That being said, it is a warm bag for a small child and it's hard to beat the price. If, course, I only bought it because it's purple."
1,waaaaaayyyyyy smaller than advertised,"Just received this bag for my very slightly taller than average three year old, and there is no way he will be able to use it. This bag is advertise as being 50"" long, and he is only 39"" tall and it is way too short for him. I will be returning this asap. I have no idea how on earth they measured 50"", but it most definitely is not. I would say that a much shorter than average two year old could possibly use it for one season, but no longer than that. Don't waste your money on this bag."
5,Makes great protein shakes,This product is sometimes hard to find so we try to stock up on it. Best taste of all the protein powers we have tried.
5,...and so it gos...,"I have loved biographys for a long time now, this is one of my favorates. Her life style is intreaging, and it boggles me to know that each page in this book is true. Jane is far from being a good person, but her passion for life, love, and writing supass any wrongs she has done. If you love life read this book; and if you don't, find out what your missing."
5,So many great recipes to share!,"This cookbook is wonderful and not sure why I waited so long to purchase it. Claudine takes you through not only wonderful delicious recipes but gives the most helpful entertaining tips throughout her book. I made the barbeque meatloaf first to RAVE reviews and ended up getting one for each one of my siblings, mother and best friends. You can tell this is from someone who truly loves to entertain and enjoys food. We just celebrated the holidays and my cookbook traveled back to Michigan in good hands so I will order another to continue my journey of great dishes in 2011. You will really use this over and over. Enjoy!"
1,STAY AWAY THIS SEAT IS DANGEROUS,The foam padding inside this seat turned into a black powder within 4 months. I tried contacting combi but they don't have an email address listed and when you call the 1800 number your call never gets through to a person or an answering service. I would like to give Amazon 5 stars for taking the item back when I contacted them and giving me back 100% refund including the shipping. I just don't agree with them for continuing to sell this dangerous product. The black power that the foam in this seat turns into could easily be swallowed by a young child and could cause serious medical problems. I have also reported this to the NTSB.
5,One of the best Nelon's recordings ever.,"Over the years, I have collected many of the Nelon's recording projects. ""Right On Time"" is one of the most uplifting and inspirational recordings. Rex Nelon added three new faces to this group; Tammy Britton, Paul White, and Charlotte Penhollow. With all the new talent, their voices all blended together to make a new, fresh sound. It doesn't seem to be as stale and the same music again and again as with some of the older recordings. Either way, I would encourage anyone to buy this recording and try it out, and listen to its message. I am sure you will enjoy it."
2,Poor writing style defeats the message,"This book has some interesting content, nothing new standard new age metaphysics, but it is, without doubt, the worst written book I've ever read. It has the tons of repetition, so much that you don't see what's new in the repetitions. Curious use of words. There is a long explanation of ""paradigm"" then the word is misused.... defeating the purpose of all the preparatory pages. If this was edited down to 10 or 20 pages it would be worth reading, but needs the work of a professional editor. But there is not enough content for the effort."
1,An introduction to pseudoscience,"This book belongs in the category of books about mysterious ""energy fields"", tachyons, and tangential vortex amplifiers. That category is pseudoscience. The author also misrepresents quantum theory.-A physicist"
3,Darwin's notion,"I picked this edition because it includes new modern evidence, not found in the original publication, that macroevolution is a fact: the cover art. Though not quite what Darwin would have wanted, descent with modification can be found in strata... the paper strata of textbooks that push his theory.Actually, this is a classic book to own even for someone like me who thinks evolution is more philosophical then scientific. Like it or not, this is one of the philisophic cornerstones of modern western civilization."
2,A technical disappointment,"The CD version of this book is very easy to use and the search function is wonderful. HOWEVER there is no way to copy text off the screen so you can paste it into other applications. I find this very frustrating and a big disappointment.The CD version of ""The Voyage of the Beagle"" suffers from the same problem. Beware."
4,A must read,"Even if one doesn't accept the concept and theory one should read this. It is an easier read than you might think, and the abridged version that this book doesn't take long to get through. It will leave one with a great understanding of what has been the most argued theory of the last century, and which continues to be argued even today."
2,Needing a magnifying glass,"Was disappointed when I opened the book to see the extremely small print - never have worn glasses and great vision, but what I'm sure was going to be a deliciously meaty book, full of Darwin's views and where they stem from, has become a book that is passed over for something more traditional in size and font.Maybe I should have read the reviews or book into closer and would have noticed this was mentioned.Oh well, someday I'll get to it...once I find my magnifying glass!Smalls"
5,One of the Greatest Books ever written,"Darwin was one of the most brilliant men who ever lived. He was perhaps the greatest observer the world has known. In 1831, he set sail on the Beagle, a tiny little ship, for a five-year cruise around the world, and without pay, as naturalist. He had studied theology, medicine, and, finally, biology and geology. He saw how organisms change with time and environment and how Biblical events simply could not have happened as stated. He spent twenty-three years going over his notes, rethinking, and agonizing over the results. In 1859, he published Origin of Species, and it upset the world. He demonstrated evolution as no one had. Uneducated religious leaders may ridicule it, but evolution is a fact, accepted by any intelligent, educated, honest person."
5,Probably the most beneficial book of the last two hundred years,"Although Darwin's gift was never for great prose, the realization of the theories in this book was a watershed moment for mankind. Darwin's theories cracked open the history of our planet, and in doing so he opened up possibilities in all fields of science, art and in life. His work stands among the great human endeavors"
5,Changed the World Forever,"Of course this is one of the landmark books in history. Completely turned biological science on its head and spawned science vs. religion debates that continue to this day. I love the one star reviews. This is one of the towering books in history, it's not meant to be entertainment. How about at least a 2nd star for its historical importance?"
2,"Good sound, comfortable, Broken after 1 month.","I bought these after shopping around a bunch. I loved them and used them all the time. For a month that is.Today when I was taking them off the center of the plastic behind the neck part snapped in two. If you are going to make a product that gets flexed in normal use, it better stand up to it.Oh well, guess I will get some sony's, I had my last pair of them till the foam ear covers wore away."
3,Not the Best Pieper book to Read,"It is unclear whether it is the German or the English translation that is at fault here, but if you are interested in reading Pieper, you may want to start somewhere else. Pieper is someone I enjoy immensely. He is very readable, is good at making concepts easy to digest, and tends to be very accessible for some who wants to get their feet wet in Thomistic philosophy. This volume was the opposite in every respect.The translator's introduction would lead the reader to believe that he a number of liberties in translating. It is unclear whether the translator committed sabotage, but the English is cumbersome and many of the sentences go on for several lines. It takes the skill of an investigative journalist and logistician to decifer some of the passages.I have enjoyed other works by Pieper translated by Richard and Clara Winston, Sister Mary Francis McCarty, and Lothar Krauth. Two personal favorites are LIESURE THE BASIS OF CULTURE and HAPPINESS AND CONTEMPLATION."
2,"Yes, Read the whole thing!","I don't see how you can isolate ""The Grand Inquisitor"" chapter from the novel in which it is situated, The Brothers Karamazov. I think that knowing who is telling the story, who he is telling the story too, what the story means to each of these people, and what the consequences of what the Grand Inquisitor have to say, are ALL important; important because it is a great novel and important in understanding the grand inquisitor!!!!!!! My suggestion: Buy The Brothers Karamazov instead of this. It's excellent."
3,Not meant to be read alone,"I originally read this while taking a course on Dostoyevsky and reading THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. Out of context, it's not as powerful. Plus, it helps to have a professor go over it in class during a course. But needing to read just this piece in a hurry, it was, as usual, spectacularly convenient to have it so readily available on Kindle."
2,A strange concept.,"How would it have been if Christ had shown up at the Spanish Inquisition?This has interesting possibilities but, it was not really developed to its full potential."
3,Daughter loves it,"This is a cute flashlight, and my daughter loves it. I, on the other hand, wish it didn't make so much noise! I didn't realize when I bought it that it says phrases everytime you push the button, and the light will only come on if you hold the button. When you let the button go it turns off. I wanted a flashlight my daughter could use if she woke up in the middle of the night - this isn't it."
2,Stink Bomb,This is easily the worst of the three albums these guys have. Pick up the other ones if you want to hear some quality western harmony rockabilly.
1,Pretty Sad,"I read this book and it was extremely boring. The author enjoys talking about himself, most of which is uninteresting. He enjoys talking about his swimming in the waters naked. Yuck!"
5,masterpieces,"some of the best criterion releases in the marketone of the most beautiful movie ever madeif you like good movies, about special things and have a huge heart( and a sizable wallet)buy this you wont regret it..."
2,Ingredients have changed!!!,"What amazon is showing is what it used to be and what my son used to like. Before it was very clear capsule w/ 5 other ingredients you can readily identify. (sunflower oil, gelatin, glycerin, water, vita C, and vita E. I used to order 1 bottle every 2 months for my son and he used to like simple seaweed flavor. Now it has modified corn starch, glycerin, high oleic sunflower oil, purified water, CARRAGEENAN, sorbitol, ascorbyl palmitate, tocopherols, natural flavor, sunflower lecithin, and caramel. Now it has stronger odor, smaller but thicker shell, and dark brown in color from its original clear orange color. My son won't touch this thing anymore. I guess they changed the formula to decrease the volume and lower the cost. Time to look for another brand."
5,DHA,DHA Neuromins are good for your brain...and are a veggie substitute for fish oils...great for people with fish or iodine allergies.Easy to swallow without additives.
1,Pathetic And Passe,This is a Sad attempt at turning a dollar I purchased this book in the attempt to learn something about the Gothic Culture but as it turns out it is nothing but Self Righteous people creating an alternate life to escape thier mundane lives.
5,Immigrant Kids,This is a great read for middle schoolers to understand how it was during the great immigration. I was impressed by the way the immigrants wanted to integrate into the American society. I recommend it.
5,Welcome to America...,"What a wonderful tribute to our country and to those people that left all they had, to join us here! The pictures and stories are amazing!"
5,The blend of visual and history will appeal to elementary grades 3-5,"If your family came to America 100 years ago, what was life like for them? Newbery Medalist Russell Freedman provides insights which pair with vintage black and white photos to describe work challenges, living conditions and more. The blend of visual and history will appeal to elementary grades 3-5, but many an older reader will find it equally unusual & compelling."
1,Immigrant Kids,"This author's over-reliance on historic photographs -- without any explanation about how the photos were taken, used and then later retrieved -- is very confusing to well-intentioned history students."
3,"Great Games, But Got Bugs","For the Casino enthusiast, this is a great Casino Game Package, complete with tournaments and most of the casino card games. But, it a has a bug that causes it to lock up every few minutes and must be re-entered, however, it does not lose your ""money."" It is very aggravating, though, so I am ordering the Bally Casino Games that has better reviews."
1,Filled with bugs,"This game has so many bugs in it I need to buy Raid!! The game loses the face/name of individual players on a regular basis, it locks up on Pai Gow, when playing craps in the challenge round it fails to recognize when someone runs out of money and you have to forfeit the challenge, and these are just a few of the problems with this game. I usually buy Hoyle but we decided to try this one instead...what a mistake. We have version 2.0 but will probably look to buy the Hoyle game instead. Typical Microsoft product...market it before you get it running!"
1,Disappointed,I had the old game and love playing it but the new game is not as fun and I do not play it as much.
1,falling off Bicycle Games,"Don't buy this bug ridden piece of dung, I bought the so called updated 2004 version. It crashes randomly at every turn, stats don't record right, the computer AI miss reads your hands not giving you credit for hands won. Its all around terribly buggy. Its been out for months and they still stock on shelfs all around the country even though its known to have major problems. They don't intend to fix anything, Activison is making a quick buck by repackaging an old game 2001 Bicycle from Microsoft, adding one or two new features and calling brand new for 2004, and in the process making totally unplayable. With the stores policy of not excepting open software you are stuck with it if you buy it,they are afraid of piracy. well Activision is the party guilty of piracy here in the form of robbing us all.STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS."
3,pretty good,"It's always nice to see and hear Chad Wackerman play, but this is hardly representative of his best work. There really isn't a lot of magic happening here."
1,Boomer whining,"this book is just another example of the blame game... nobody takes responsibility for their own actions... couldn't it be your father was a jerk before he went to the war... i don't doubt that the war had a profound effect on them, but so did the depression in which most of them grew up... my father was in the war, saw allot of combat, was at the liberation of a concentration camp, and came home and raised his family with love and kindness. he didn't feel like he needed to psychoanalyze the whole experience... he shielded his kid's from the war because it was ugly and talked about it only with his fellow soldiers... what's so wrong with that..."
3,Formidable driver.,"These are pretty good. They're a little too sharp on the high side, but an EQ adjustment can help with that issue. They have respectable fidelity, but only to about 1000 hz. They're nothing special, though. I prefer the $0.80 speakers I tried replacing with these overall. There's nothing wrong with them, but there's nothing great either."
5,Great Book!!!,"I'm a big sports fan and I loved ""The Kid From Courage."" It tells the story of a junior tennis player who is trying hard to succeed at tennis. He meets an old man who becomes his coach, and it's very cool how they have to deal with a bunch of stuff, but they don't give up. I won't give it away, but it's exciting how the book ends when he has to play the biggest tournament of his whole life. My best friend is reading it now and he says it is fantastic. I think all kids who like sports will like reading it."
4,Spicy Aranjuez,"(...) Now that I've heard virtually the entire CD, I can say that it's OK. Paco's playing of the Aranjuez Adagio falls a bit short of John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra. On the other hand, Paco's performance of both the Allegro con Spirito and the Allegro Gentile are most enjoyable, with the bright, rhythmic, and percussive flamenco sound working really well for the two allegro movements. The tempo of those two movements is also a little faster than most other performances; this really adds to the excitement. Furthermore, the accompanying performance by The Orquesta de Cadaques is very energetic. I found the rest of the CD's compositions (Triana, El Albaicin, and El Puerto) much less enthralling but decent enough. After all, Rodrigo's Aranjuez is really a tough act to follow. Summing up, I give the two allegro movements of Aranjuez a five-star rating and the rest of the CD a three-star rating."
3,There are better renditions,"Aranjuez is one of the most beautiful pieces in modern music. This is excellent, but there are better covers for me. Sample what is out there, find your preference."
3,"Enough of the Concerto de Aranjuez, enough!","This piece, sadly, has been played to death. Paco de Lucia gives a decent performance. Those above who sing his praises should keep in mind that it's a concerto and a collaborative effort among the guitarist, a conductor, and the orchestra. Also keep in mind that Paco's greatest asset is his nimble fingers. Do you suppose he could get the whole concerto down to under 5 minutes? Would you enjoy it if he did?I was enchanted with this piece when I first heard it 40 years ago. Nowadays I avoid listening to it."
2,2 stars - for only 2 songs,"2 stars for 2 songs: ""Summer breezin"" and ""sugar sugar"" are really convincing and quite up to the level of her first hit ""shy guy"". The rest of the album is ok, but not very spectacular and rather boring to my ears."
3,Useful introductory guide to mindfulness,"A nice little book full with suggestions for reflection and mindful practice. This would be a useful introductory guide for those who are beginning to explore the topic of mindfulness and would like to learn how it could be applied to their lives.For me personally the book lacked depth in discussing the presented topics, with most chapters only containing a few pages.Dr Christine Maingard, Author of 'Think Less Be More:Mental Detox for Everyone'"
3,A bit disappointing,"This book was a bit disappointing. It's a small, short book and for the price I really expected more. A good portion of the pages were filled with blank space and quotes. It might be a good book if you're just starting to look into mindfulness living but if you've read other books on the subject you'll find alot of the content only slightly different from what you've already read."
2,Some interesting info but disappointing,"The beginning of the book has some interesting concepts which are unfortunately underdeveloped in the book. The focus seems to be on highly paranoid individuals, their symptoms, and examples of them. The later part of the book merely rattles off stories of notable people without fully discussing the paranoid features. Additionally, the typos and writing style lead me to think that there was little care put forth in producing this book.I bought this book for the purposes of finding out more about paranoia because some people close to me are sufferers. This book did not help me in my quest for more insightful information."
5,Great Insight into the Game,"This is not a ""how to do"" book but an insight into the world of golf as seen through the eyes, or shall I say words, of George Plimpton. It's a great read, and as of this writing, I'm almost half way through.I am enjoying this book, and as a new golfer, I am pleased to realize my errors are not mine alone.If you like and hate golf this is the book for you. Read it."
5,Well worth the price!,"I purchased this for my 13 year old daughter who, for some reason has developed a crush on Michael J. Fox. After collecting the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, and both volumes of the ""Spin City"" DVD's, this collection was an economical way to expand her back catalog of films Michael J. Fox has starred in.4 movies for under $15 ? How can you go wrong? One can only hope that someday soon ""Light Of Day"", the movie he starred in with Joan Jett will be made available on DVD. That, and the entire ""Spin City"" series. Until then, this collect is, and will remain, highly recommended."
5,Awesome quality/packaging for 4 movies!,"I like ""The Secret of My Success"" and had it on video and finally decided to pick up a DVD copy. Ended up picking up all 4 movies in this collection for around $9. 3 separate DVDs contain the 4 movies. Watched ""The Secret of My Success"" last night with no problems. Container is fancier than another 4 movie collection I picked up at the same time and as a Michael J. Fox fan, I look forward to watching the other movies. Don't expect many extra features on the DVDs though - with some older movies, there probably weren't any beyond the trailer anyway."
3,Before you purchase,toe ring is cute...but the picture is misleading...it looks like the toe ring is adjustable...but infact it is not...i tried to make it wider to fit onto my toe and it broke in half...so it a one size fits all...but the size is too small to get onto the toe...and if you have skinny toes to big to stay on the toe...
4,Addendum.,"Mistaking the trees for the wood, I forgot to mention the most important aspect of Bresson's last masterpiece, 'L'Argent': one of the greatest shots in all cinema. In the immediate aftermath of a domestic murder, blood flecked on dully garish wallpaper is briefly illumined by a fallen lampshade before it's extinguished. Shattering."
3,A Mournful Tale,"Bresson has made some unparallelled films over a great part of the twentieth century. 'Balthasar' and 'Diary of A Country Priest', are right up there with my all time favourites. Friends try to convince me that 'Lancelot'(his excurison into colour) and,'L'Argent' are classics too. I can't agree. The narrative here is quite simple and the morality, so stripped back that it it feels like a Sunday School lesson.Even in 'Lancelot', where the acting was bereft of emoting, there was some degree of intimacy, that facilitated connections for me. Here, the characters are rendered as automatons, which is clearly part of Bresson's intention, but makes for some unreal, de-animated cause and effect. Interersting tale, artful photography, a bleak and discomforting fable. I wouldn't race out to catch this one, nor judge his contributions to cinema on the strength of it. He is undoubtedly in the Bunuel,Bergman, Dreyer, Tarkovsky,Kurosowa league."
3,Alpha Omega Elite - DO NOT PURCHASE THIS SEAT!,"I too, like most mothers did a lot of on line research. I searched for the perfect seat to accommodate my second child of 6 months. I ordered the Alpha Omega on line and was very disappointed upon receipt. The new EPP Foam head rest is a huge improvement however the padding behind baby's back leaves very little space for baby's behind even with the crotch strap in the 3 slot. How this ever got passed the QA Engineers is mind blowing! And as one of the othe mother's pointed out, the baby's head in the recline position still flops forward. I am taking mine back to the store today. Still searching for the perfect seat. Do be cogniscent of the fact that yes Eddie Bauer and Alpha Omega are the same car seat made by the same maker (Cosco) just another way to charge more money for the same seat! Pretty funny hu?"
1,Should have listened to the bad reviews,"I really hate this after using the one we bought from Costco.We had read the review about some good points being safe andable to sleep well. Well, with our Honda Pilot, that chairsimple cannot be reclined any bit for any comfort. And tryingto download instructions is a joke. It is so difficult and complicatedto use, I will NEVER recommend this to anyone other than an enemy.Our baby did not like it either, and the latch is so sharp I almostcut myself trying to unhook it to change to forward position (finally!)It is very user friendly, unless you have a person dedicated totaking care of your baby and is mechanically inclined, don't bother.Single moms should really stay away from this unless you haveall the time and resources in the world. I am sorry to soundso frustrated, but I am. It might be safe, but very difficult touse."
3,Questionable as a Booster,"This has been a good seat for my son since he was 12 mos. He's now 4, 44 lbs & 43"" tall. The manual claims the seat can be used on a child <52"" height, but my son has very little to go until the back of the seat meets the top of his ears, the limit according to the manufacturer as outlined in the instruction manual. I wonder what child at 52"" would properly fit in this seat if mine at 43"" has nearly outgrown it? Beware of this seat's claim to be the only one you'll ever need."
4,Well Worth the Money,"We've had this car seat since our daughter was four months old-she's now 27 mo old-and it has been well worth the money.When the car seat was rear-facing, it was a tiny bit of a pain since the seat is quite high but, now that we have turned the seat around, the height is not an issue.I'm short and I know that our daughter will be short so she will have to sit in a booster of some sort for quite a while and I'm confident that this seat will continue to hold up.We also have a five month old son who is 27 inches long and about to out grow his infant carrier. I know that we will purchase another of these seats for him.Bottom line: Initially expensive but pays for itself with the product's life span."
2,Believe those who say it's a pain,"For all of the reviews that said this car seat was a pain to work with, we thought we'd give it a try. After all, it is very highly rated for safety. Well, believe those reviews. I would rather have spent the extra money for an easier car seat to deal with.We should have known better when the fireman at the free car seat check-up/installation took one look and groaned."
4,Safe reliable carseat for the price,"We are very pleased with this car seat. We began using it when our daughter turned 1. She is very comfortable in the seat. However, the seat is very large and bulky and doesn't work well in small cars. Also, it doesn't recline back much so I can't see it working well for an infant. I gave it a good review based on the fact that we've only used it as a toddler seat."
4,Great next step,"I bought this seat for my son when he outgrew the Evenflo Truimph (which I loved). He was over 2 years old, so I don't know about the infant issues other say they had. This has been a great seat for my toddler, who is about ready to use it as a booster now. It's roomy enough for him to bring things in with him, easy to get him in and out of, and still looks good (a miracle in my van of boys) after a couple of years of use."
4,Death of an analogue,"Yes indeed. With Klaus Schulze, it has always been the question of technology. First goes the technolgoy, then the music. Once in the late 1979 he lais his crafty hands on the digital synthesizer equipment, an album like DIG IT must have followed. Klaus explores the possibilities of the new instruments here, focusing mainly on looped digital drum tracks along with equally looped synthesizer ostinatos. This is a hard-to-digest album, as with the exception of the very first minutes of the last track, it is very heavily drummed, with dense sequencing atmosphere.You will come back to this album though, because it is still Schulze's album from the good old days - it does leave something inside you."
3,"Or at least, dig in!","Made in GER in 19??, Serial# 811-632-2, Playing Time 48:51As the opening track ""Death Of An Analogue"" suggests, album #13 marks KS's first exploration in digital recording. Unlike previous efforts, the percussives here are all artificial, mainly done through drum loops and electronics.The sounds will be familiar if you're a KS afficionado. Vocals, or should I say, whispers, are typically processed through a vocoder; I found that to be a bit distracting as I prefer his instrumental material.It's a fairly pleasing album, generally enthusiastic, at least compared to some recent recordings that were a bit darker.If you like electronic music, without baroque arrangements, then this disc is a good introduction to the artist; not quite a ""classic"" like ""Timewind"", but an honorable effort to celebrate the arrival of the 80's and the digital age."
5,Must read for better understanding,"Martinez adds detail and insight into the stories of families featured on this PBS series. The video available from PBS and his book provide an excellent combination for educators, community leaders, and the general public to better appreciate the strengths and resolve immigrants bring to this country as well as the barriers, obstacles, and prejudices they face from those whose families came to the nation in earlier times."
4,Book was good(not excellent),"I read through the whole book and it told me about the lizard I am going to get. It told me how much it will be, what to feed it, how big it will be after a juvenile, and it told me what size tank I should put in there."
4,Excellent Live Representation of OHM:,"This is probably my favorite release from OHM:. While I love all of their releases, this one just has such a great energy to it, and the sound is incredible. Did I mention that it was recorded live during a live radio show? Yeah, these guys play without a net.The entire band are incredible musicians. The great Chris Poland just absolutely shreds in the most tasteful way, Pag shreds on the 6 string fretless bass (how was this guy not discovered and made famous????), and this recording marked the debut of Kofi Baker with the band. Although continually referred to as Ginger Baker's son, Kofi is an amazing musician in his own right; he needn't have the precursor of Giner Baker's Son when referring to him, as IMHO, he is as good if not better than his father.There is a great group of songs here, and I don't think anyone would skip through any of them; quite enjoyable.If you are unsure of which OHM: recording to start with, then let it be this one."
5,A Forgotten Treasure,"I pulled this cd out. For a brief moment I had to relive the pain of him not being with us anymore. What ever you can get your hands on by this man is worth the price their asking. An incredible talent, he could actually play two horns at once. The majority of his work was with Jeff Lorber whose name alone speaks for itself. The standouts here include the title Pocket City, Inside Myself, Passion Sunrise, LA and my all time favorite by Art KGB. A consistent performer, I also highly recommend Undercover and the tribute album For Art's Sake. He left us a wonderful legacy in the form of what he loved most. His signature runs have yet to be duplicated by anyone and that is as it should be."
3,Peter the Great,"This is the first book I have read about Peter the Great, having known very little of him. Perhaps it is the author's bias, but Peter is portrayed relentlessly as an arrogant monarch who has very little regard for the common person. His bad temper is frequently described throughout the book, portraying him as a very disliked man. I got the impression that the author also did not like Peter and I became rather tired of reading the same negative comments about the monarch throughout the book. Consequently, I did not finish reading it."
3,An absolute must read for the Visitor to Russia,"What is Russian if not Peter, Catherine, Lenin and Stalin. You must know them all before you go to truly get the most from your Russian experience. This work on Peter is a good read. What a guy that you need to understand to understand Russia! The real thing on Peter, Catherine and Nicholas and Alexandra are the Robert Massie works. This book will get you started but read Massie by all means and he's on Kindle as well."
3,LARGE PRINT. DONE WITH A COPYING MACHINE.,"This is a LARGE PRINT addition. No mention of that is made in the description.More importantly, the ""reprint"" can be best described as a photocopy of some student's (?) old manuscript. There are what appear to be pencil underlinings all over the place, with a couple of notes in the margins! Somehow that's just cheesy. Seriously, this could have been fixed up easily with a scanner.OK, that said, the narrative of the book is quite good. It is a compelling story that holds the Reader's interest at all times."
1,Don't waste your money,"Don't waste your money. Not worth the time to download much less the purchase price. When it does start, the display doesn't refresh properly and the screen fills up with garbage and you can't see what is happening on the screen."
4,The Death Committiee,A gripping in depth story which historically records the training and emotional depth of those who choose to become key players in the medical community.A must read which will jar your emotions and expose the drama the determination and dedication of those who want to be contributors in the medical revolution.
5,masterpiece,"This is simply a masterpiece. Nomi is a protege of Sakamoto and here his orchestration shines. Track 1. bears all the stunning hallmarks of a masterwork. If you dont listen to the whole score (and please ignore the whole Country Roads rendition which is awful), at least open your heart to this gem. In relation to the story,the orchestration is a marvel and delight and traces the progress of a young girl waking to the morning sun--enthused and amazed--and proceeds to stroll down to street level--further enlivened by the morning sun to which she looks up to--and promptly, melodically gasps. Beautiful!"
4,History with personal details,This is a reprint of an enjoyable 1940 book which fell into disfavor because its author did not oppose San Francisco city leaders' plans to get rid of the surviving cable cars. The book contains well-researched history and personal details from many participants.- Joe Thompson
4,Future Noir is Kicking,Philip K Dick is one of the best storytellers of the sci-fi genre. His short works and most of his novels are interesting dives into the nature of humanity and reality. Great reading that will twist your brain or leave you perplexed. I recommend Philip Dick to anyone looking for sci-fi that is out of the norm. [...]
5,"What, no listing of the content?",Essential reading for a PKD fan and someone who wants to see where the ideas for some of Hollywood's recent films came from. Some of these have way different endings and only somewhat resemble the films for which they're credited as the genesis.What I would like to see here is a LIST of what is actually in this collection. Amazon's information has nothing.
4,"Gil, Genialidad, & Jorge","Este album no es ni Gilberto, ni Jorge. Es un híbrido de dos voces que representan movimiento, rebelión y buenas canciones.Casi todo acústico, con ritmos tropicales y grooves suaves. lo que más me gusta es cuando Gilberto canta, de repente se te olvida que Jorge también está ahi, entonces cuando sale es como oh! una voz que reconozco. por alguna razón esta suena mas rasposa que en las grabaciones, pero eso no es algo nada malo. En general, Jorge es mi parte favorita de este encuentro, y sí, es muy recomendado si sólo te gusta uno de los 2. ah y si te gusta moverte a los ritmos brasileños de los 70."
4,pretty awesome,"great album. i've got a few jorge ben albums that i love. I have gil's eletracustico, but i didn't get a real sense of gil's style until i heard this album. it's worth your time."
2,Good Idea that Didn't Pan Out,I got this album after hearing Jorge Ben's great music on Africa Brasil. I checked around and read that this was a good one to get. I've got to say that I was disappointed. It all just sounds a bit off. The singing is slightly out of tune enough to drive you crazy and the music never really takes off like I had read it would. Try Africa Brasil for a real taste of Jorge Ben or Tropicalia 2 if you are looking for Gilberto Gil.
1,a true throwaway effort,so i did. out the window one night. absolutely unlistenable. way too indulgent. [and i really like Gil].
5,Brilliant,"Gil is not inspired????? There's nothing but inspiration in the whole record. To say that Gil is out of tune is equal to say that Dave Brubeck played out of tune in ""Time Out""!!! Gil and Jorge are one of the most perfect duo's that ever played. Songs like ""Meu glorioso So Cristovo"" or ""Jurubeba"" are the real brazilian classics.. As someone wrote, how rate it less than 5 stars?"
1,Not happy with this,"The whole point of going wireless was the move the computer to a spot I could see on the bike, but to finally get this to work it was almost on the tire itself and even a shorter distance than the wired unit that I had. Went to using my iPhone and a free app on that to track all my information, it worked out better than anything I tried. Ended up giving this unit away."
3,"Complex, in-depth analysis of dreams; not for someone with no patience for great detail","This book gives great detail on dream analysis and how it can be used in treatment. Basically all dreams seem to come down to body functions and/or sex according to Sharpe; however her details, while demanding a great deal of attention, help the therapist understand how enlightening dreams can be."
4,Great! Only one minor detail...,"Bought this kitchen for my 1.5 year old little girl. Already after the first day I can see that many more hours of fun will come from this toy! It didn't take my husband too long to put together, maybe 2ish hours. It seems very sturdy and I love the compact size. My only complaint is the size of the shelf in the oven and fridge. We bought my daughter the Melissa and Dough apple pie set to go with the kitchen, but the apple pie won't even fit on the oven shelf. My daugter got very frustrated by this! I just wish the self was a bit deeper!"
1,Poor quality,This product came with 2 pieces that are warped - so the oven door closes too far and the fridge door won't close all the way. The stove / sink top piece is split and the screw holes for the faucet were drilled too small.I would not recommend.
5,"Great size, great features","This wooden kitchen is the perfect item for people who don't have a huge amount of space and don't want a giant plastic kitchen taking up room. It was pretty simple to put together and has enough features to keep my daughter interested (phone, clock, dials, oven, fake water dispenser, etc.) without driving me insane (nothing makes annoying sounds). Best of all, she can enjoy having a kitchen without it monopolizing our entire basement."
5,Fabulous!,My little boy cooks us meals all day long. He never gets bored with any of the features. One of the best investments I've made.
2,Disappointing video.,"I must admit I was quite disappointed with this video. The video is advertised as a collection of period car commercials and promotional films. It is that indeed.My problem with the video is that the commercials and short promos are all of mundane subject matter. There are no classic commercials or promos of the performance models, the rare trim levels, the more desirable luxury models. As an example, one promo was about the (relative) fuel economy of the Chevrolet Impala compared to it's Ford and Chrysler competitors in which each car had a glass container mounted on the hood showing how much fuel was left as each car drove along a test track. This is not exactly what I would call an interesting classic car commercial.The segment on the Corvair was okay, so I gave this two-stars. Overall, to me, this wasn't worth the money unless one is interested in how many shopping bags can be put into the trunk of a Dodge Polara compared to others in its class."
5,Mind-Bending Fairy Tales I've Never Heard Before,"There's something almost wild in some of these fairy tales that make them entertaining for me, as well as my son. Plus, there are quite a few stories in here, which gives us lots of material for bedtime stories for quite some time. A few of them I've heard versions of before, but it includes tales from many different places, so there are quite a few that are brand-new to me. Truthfully, these are not the milder fairy tales we're used to, so parents might want to preview for very young children."
2,NOT WHAT IT SEEMS,"This book is not what it seems. It is really just a re-telling of regional fairytells and fables and not a very well editted ones as that. I down loaded lots of these different ""color"" of fairy books . I scanned 2 or 3 and all were simular. Then I erased them all. You can see why they are free. Just a waste of space on my Kendal."
5,Exceedingly good fun,Buy both Tao of Muhammed Ali and Zen of Muhammed Ali and Other Obsessions - and all of Davis Miller's other books! They are amongst the most important pieces of literature to have been published in the last 100 years! Simply mind blowing. And incredibly fun.
3,This book is not what it looks like...,"I read this book because I thought it was about Muhammad Ali himself. Instead, it's about some guy who likes Ali and shares his experiences with him. That's it. It's not a story about Ali, it's really just a plain story about Davis Miller. I still think it is a really good book, but the title should be ""Me and Ali"" or something like that. The Tao of Muhammad Ali sounds like it's about Ali. It's not just about him, though. I think the looks of the book are misleading"
2,below average,I agree with the above. This book is more about miller than Ali. This was one big ego trip for the author
1,Waste of money at ANY price!,I bought this flashlight an used it a few times and a few times is all it can be used. I hadn't picked it up in a couple of months and when I tried to use it I could not get it to turn on. Lousy product.
1,Save Your Money - Buy a Surefire or MagLite,"I don't usually write reviews, but this product is so bad that I wanted to warn others. I own many fine flashlights, and I am afraid this is not one of them. First, the flashlight drains batteries even when it is off. I wrote to Smith and Wesson, and they referred me to the company that produces the flashlights for them, Powertech. Powertech will not respond to e-mails/voicemails. Even with new batteries, the light from the 3 white LED's is inadequate (I would say it is around 15 lumens or so at best), and the UV beam is even weaker. Would be good for detailed work (up close hobbies and the like) but completely inadequate outdoors for hunting and tracking purposes. For the same price, the new 3 watt LED mini-mag lite is a suprisingly good option. It has a powerful beam that can be focused. My advice would be to spend $10 bucks more and get a Surefire G2 Nitrolon. This is a horrible product, and I would strongly advise against purchasing it."
3,Surprisingly mediocre flashlight,"I currently have a few flashlights, the mini-magliteBLK 2AA Mini Maglite, and Maglite 4C Cell Flashlight, Black - S4C016. They are all well and good but I sometimes accidentally leave them on and then have to go clambering around to find new batteries. LEDs seem to be the answer to that problem.I bought an LED conversion kit for one of my 2AA mini maglitesNite Ize L.E.D. Upgrade Kit - Whitethe kit worked well and I enjoyed using it.When I had the opportunity to buy a new flashlight I thought I'd make it interesting and get the Galaxy 6 LED. If it has 3 white LEDs it ought to be brighter than a normal 1 LED surely? Sadly I seem to be wrong.The flashlight does its job okay but 3 LEDs do not seem brighter than the 1 LED flashlight I currently have, however, the UV LEDs make things interesting.Overall this is an interesting product that does provide light but only time will tell if the body and the batteries hold up to what Smith & Wesson promise."
2,made in china,"I am very disappointed with my flashlight. Yes, it works fine. Yes, it fits the description about the product. But I truly thought that, being a Smith & Wesson, it would be made in USA and therefore would not be lacking most of the quality reassurance and labor standards that make a product worth to buy. I will NOT buy any more S&W products. Amazon should make a better effort to inform the manufacturing origin of the products it sells."
4,Too Complex,"I am a long time US Robotics Pilot 1000 to Palm V user who has been thrilled with the battery life and utter simplicity of the palm series. This device doesn't even come close on the basic aspect of calendar entry or viewing. The day/week/month chooser on the palm is always on the calender screen. With iPaq it is always at least two clicks away. Neither one will allow greater that 1/2 hr apptments that are clearly distinguished. The screen however, just absolutely leave Palm in the dust.... If Palm Vc was out with the screen on the iPaq I would have bought it a year ago....However, it will virtually always eliminate one of Palms other big attractions and that is either the loooong life of very simple and inexpensive batteries."
2,iPac Expansion just a must,"Guys, face it, without this expansion card, your iPac is a dud. The Expansion module is bulky and covers the sleek iPac to look like a Russian made tractor. It has no grace, but bite your lips you need this module. Perhaps someone else, a third party, will make a sleeker unit"
3,HELP! 2 questions about the iPaq CF Flash Expansion Pak,HELP! I'm thinking about buying a CF Expansion Pak for iPAQ pocket PC. 2 questions: (i) WHERE DO I find out about the rebate that other's mentioned in thier reivews? I looked on Compaq's website but can't find in mentioned anywhere. Please help. (ii) Does this support CF Type I *&* Type II? I'm thinking about also buying an IBM microdrive -- but was told it only fits in a CF slot that's Type II compatable (too big to fit otherwise).
4,Great,"Best deep-ridges winter mat I could find at a reasonable price, Had to do a little snipping to fit great, and now it does. May want to find a way to prevent these from moving, like velcro, sticky spray, or another method."
5,The finest Italian-American Christmas Album,"Growing up in an Italian-American household, I heard a lot of music by Jimmy Roselli, Jerry Vale, Tony Bennet, Frank Sinatra Perry Como and Dean Martin. Of them all, Jimmy Roselli's Christmas album rates the best with me. His smooth croonings will make you want to sit down and eat a big bowl of pasta! I especially like the 2 songs which I have never seen on any other album: Buon Natale and Christmas Song. They show off Mr. Roselli's unique vocal stylings. BUONO NATALE AND BON APPETITO!"
3,Reputation supercedes total merit,"Alexander Dovzhenko's silent war film about the 1918 struggle of Bolshevik workers at a Kiev munitions factory against White Russian troops, which he intermingles with Ukrainian myth. It's an intriguing relic of European filmmaking, clearly influenced by the virtuoso montage editing of Sergei Eisenstein, though it is dated and hampered by the feeling that it was commissioned as propaganda at the time. A multifarious moral examination of war none the less."
3,Not Enough Bang,"The film itself is only a compilation of scenes which have no inherent meaning to someone living outside of Russia. I won't deny that some of the images and techniques were quite revolutionary at the time (filmed 1928) but the problem with the film is that it has no interest to the intellectual or common man. We are merely watching an arranged form of pictures, ranging from a one arm man beating a horse, to a toothless soldier in the war. Everything in between is awkward, haphazard and quite unnecessary. It would have been possible to invent a forum which kept the viewer interested but this would not be it although the method of the director is quite brilliant. In all, one should view this if they are an art student or a student of pre-Tarkovskian cinema."
4,Practice for my upcoming reunion.,"I really enjoy this DVD. I wanted to learn the swing from the 50's and refresh my memory on the dances of the 60's. Christy does a quick review of the 60's dances but spends time on the swing. Now, if my husband would just learn to be a good lead. LOL The only negative thing that I can say is about the price. Too expensive but I ordered it because it was just what I wanted."
3,A good introduction to Ms. Lincoln,"I'd really like to give this record 3 stars. The reason is that although there are some really good jazz songs here, like ""Bird Alone"", ""I'm In Love"", and ""And How I Hoped For Your Love"", there are a couple of clunkers, notably ""You Made Me Funny"" and ""When I'm Called Home"". That said, there are a few other things you should know. The band, for instance, is phenomenal, and the tenor sax of Stan Getz is perfect. The fact that there are only 10 songs made me feel a little cheated, certainly they had room for 12 or 14. And Ms. Lincoln is well into her 60s; you can hear the limitations that age has brought to her voice range."
4,essential information,"Sorry, I am not in order but I don't know where to say this because I am not a great computer chap. I am a lover of jazz music and have, what I believe to be, a great collection. Amazon.com is doing a wonderful job for the jazz lovers. But I believe the NAMES OF THE ACCOPANISTS MUST BE FEATURED PROMINENETLY WITH THE APPEARANCE OF EVERY CD WITH BUYING INFORMATION. It should not appear incidentally in the reviews. We all know how this information is absolutely indispensable for judging jazz music. Imagine a Mccoy Tyner or Tony Williams not being mentioned. I sincerely believe that, however humble the accomapnists, they should figure in the CD information importantly. Then only meaningful critique can be attempted. Thanks.Krishnamoorthy, Advocate"
1,dreadful,Ms Lincoln feels it is important to e-nun-ci-ate very clearly to show everyone just how angry she is! An-gry a-bout ev-ery thing. Dreadful. Why did Stan Getz waste his time with her?
2,Typical 80's T & A,"I remember back as a teenager watching ""A Current Affair"" when Maury Povich was still the host. There was a story on this very movie because the opening scene was filmed at a high school and consisted of 20 or so scantilly clad women and a voluptuous teacher that greeted the hero with the line, ""Is that an apple in your pocket or are you just glad to see me?"" Obviously, this was a dream sequence, but nontheless, I think that alone was worth the $3.00 I paid for this movie. The rest is pretty much mind-numbing."
5,Best Advanced Yoga DVD,"If you're looking for the 'real deal' you found it. Yogi Hari is amazing. He is over 60 something and his energy and presence are extremely srong.There are great advanced postures in this DVD, and like all his others, it is so flowing. You work hard but its in one way just fun and the other so meditative.As another reviwer stated, it does dedicate a good amt of time to breathing exercises, but I find it a plus. After you feel so relaxed yet energized.In no way is this DVD lacking.This is a great DVD, and recommend it to those practicing yoga already at a more intermediate level,and ready for the next step.Have fun!"
3,Good but not fabulous,"I enjoyed this book - classic quest story with interesting characters. The ending, however, seemed a bit flat, as if the author lost interest or ran out of time. Or perhaps she had already started working on a sequel - the ending definitely leaves room for one. I would happily put this book in the hands of an 8- to 14-year-old voracious reader, but if you have more books on your to-read list than time to read them, you can probably skip this one."
4,Captivating...Until the ending,"Throughout the story, The Treekeepers held me captivated with the story of Bird, the land of Wen, and Bird's companions. But the ending left me feeling unsatisfied, and the story felt unresolved. I got the sense that the author rushed through the ending, or tried to blur it because she was unsure of how it should go. All in all, I thought this was a very good book, but unless there is a sequel, I think the ending was a let down."
3,A more elaorate version of Cayenne Brochure,"The pictures were great and abundant. The part which I found most interesting were tips to the new owner. Actually, it tells you not to do anything violent (from an offroad prespective) despite all the stuns they did in testing and demonstration (what most of the photos were about.) It is great for those like myself whom are awaiting for the arrival of their own Cayenne. The coverage on Cayenne's manufcturing plant and process is very limited and so does the photo covering this area. It is a great collector's item as the book is published by the factory. Yet, if you are considering buying it to find out more information, you will be disappointed as you can find out more from the internet than this book."
5,ALL TIME CLASSIC,"The songs and arrangements on this album are true treasures.The title track is sweet and nostalgic, setting the tone for the album. ""Where Do You Start"" is one of the great ballads of all time, with a lyric that touches deeply. This is Shirley Horn at her peak, with an album that should've received even greater recognition that it did. Share this album with someone you love.Ms. Horn, your music will live on forever!"
5,A Wonderful Human Being,Shirely Horn has always seemed like a warm human being. There is charactor to her voice and style. She was an elegant woman whose singing gripped my heart. This album is a good representative of the quality of music she gave us.
5,thanks for the pleasure you procured us,"we are french and have heard you cd and your voice for the first time two weeks ago, yu are so wonderful with a so incredible sensual and strong voice thank for the greatest feeling you gave us"
5,Perfection!,"If you read the earlier reviews, almost anything I could say would be redundant. I believe this is Shirley's finest album (also my favorite). This is a woman who sings about all of the experiences and emotions that we have all felt......and makes it so extremely personal. With a ballad, she has no peers. Her use of time and space between words has always reminded me of the way Miles Davis played the trumpet.The orchestration should be required learning for those arrangers who aspire to use strings in a jazz album. This is the ultimate example!If you want to experience something excruciatingly beautiful, get this cd!"
5,A Marvel,"I have been listening to this album, periodically, when the mood strikes, since 1997. I get something new and ever more moving out of it each time. The way Ms. Horn slows the cadence of a song feels as if she's slowing life. This is, quite simply, my favorite album."
5,Here's to Life - The Standard,"Shirley Horn is the standard against whom all might be judged. She's a superb, lyrical jazz pianist. Her phrasing and passion are nuanced and sublime. For anyone who's loved and lost, this CD, wrapped with elegant and sensitive orchestral accompaniment, should be an elixir. Warmed and inspired by Shirley's music, you'll begin to heal and embrace the future with hope. Here's to life! - to ""chasing dreams and placing bets""."
5,"THIS IS A STUDY IN CLASS ,","I DO NOT KNOW WHEN I HAVE HEARD ANY MUSIC {I MEAN JAZZ} ATTAIN THE LEVEL OF INTELLIGENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME IT HOLDS YOU CAPTIVE IN ITS PRESENTATION. THE LUSH ARRANGEMENTS, SHIRLEY""S PIANO STYLE, SORT OF LIKE YOU ARE BEING SEDUCED LISTENING FOR THE NEXT NOTE, HER DEVELOPED STYLE OF HESITATION IS REMARKABLE IN HER.SINGING AND PLAYING THE PARADE OF SENSITIVE SONGS WILL KEEP YOU LISTENING ""WHAT COMES NEXT"", YOU WILL ASK......THE OPENER ""HERE'S TO LIFE"" IS JUST THAT.DOES IT SOUND AS IF I AM PARTIAL? YEP! AS SOON AS I FINISH THIS REVIEW, I AM CLICKING BACK TO BUY A COPY FOR A FRIEND"
5,Here's to Shirley,"The first cut I ever heard from Shirley Horn was ""You Won't Forget Me"", and I've been in love with her ever since. Throughout the CD her piano playing and singing paint vivid pastels of new and lost love. This recording is perfect for those quiet evenings with that special someone or those times when one might want to spend the evening alone contemplating life."
3,The Standard,"I bought this book as it is one of the nursing ""standards"" for decades. This book will be helpful as a reference for our proceudre manual as well as for our staff."
3,Old version,I did not realize that this is the older edition and was a hardback book when I was purchasing it. It is still a great reference but the 1970's version not the new 2009 I was thinking. The book arrived fast and was in good condition.
1,Nursing book,I was disappointed in this product in that it didn't show the date of the book. To find out the book was printed in the 70's.It was cool to look at but the seller needs to show the date of the book. I was looking for a newer version.
3,"Bought it, but never really used it.","I had to buy this product for my nursing classes, but I have never used it for my paperwork. I have thumbed through it, but I could have done without purchasing this book. It is detailed and informative, but I didn't really have any use for it."
5,Excellent Condition/Service,The book came in excellent condition and I receive it within 5 days of purchase. Could not desire better service.
5,"Longlasting, easy to use","This is my second set of these in five years. I use them on my farm for a variety of rough duty chores, and they jold up great. The coated hooks prevent cuts and scratches which other cords may allow."
5,Highland 91338 Triple Strength Bungee Cord Assortment,So far very good set. Wish they had more that were the same size in the set but the quality of the cords has been very good
5,HIGH QUALITY,Bottom line: these bungees are high quality and not some cheap knock-off. I will buy more in the future- without a doubt.
1,This guy needs to check his prices!,"Where is Malloy getting his values from? I remember when he had Comics Values Monthly, the values were right on. But now it seems like he just pulls prices out of thin air. If you want to determine a fair value for your comics, look elsewhere."
5,Money as Sacrament,"This book is quite unique. The author knows the power of money through her own experience as well as interviews with others. It is a fun read and an enlightening one. The author is clever, witty and insightful. I recommend this book to anyone wishing to understand the power of money in their lives.Trish McCabe"
1,What a JOKE!,"This book was given to me by a friend, and as I read it I became more and more curious why someone would even write a book with titles like: Marilyn: Money Mixed with SEX?This book is an unhappy compilation of people who are focused on money and the happiness it should be bringing them. They seem clueless that the lack of Jesus in their lives is the reason why they cannot get over their addictions to money.This is a very Catholic book about trying to make oneself feel better about having a large sum of money. The book examines such queer questions such as(page 218), ""What is the deepest calling you can hear about the sacred potential about money in your life"".This author needs to get a life."
5,Unique approach to money,"A lively and interesting compilation of the stories of over 50 women and their very varied experiences with and perceptions of money. Interspersed with the author's own unique account (from salesperson in her family's grocery store as a young girl, to years in a convent, and then managing her own inheritance later in life) it is a thought-provoking read, and may well change the way you think about money."
4,Incongito's Early daze...,"Bluey Maunick's Incognito is one of the best bands few have heard. Inspirational dance beats with a vibrant que for catchy beats and original production. Incognito released 2 CD's 1992: ""Inside Life"" and ""Tribes, Vibes, and Scribes."" Inside Life is the more instrumental of the two. There are only a few vocal tracks on this CD. Yet those are very delicious! It seems the music on Inside Life was meant for a main CD but had to be culled into 2 halves. ""Once Step To a Miracle"" is the first track that will catch your attention. Catchy, powerful, and an incredibly smooth mix of drums, bass, horns, and synths. ""Love is the Colour"" is another standout. Crisp, easy, and very deep. My favorite is ""Soho."" Linda Muriel's sweet and sexy voice coupled with Bluey Maunick's vocal synth's blend well in this funky track.Overall, I love this CD. It may not be a staple of many collections. I can assure you it will be one hard to avoid listening when it is!"
4,Funk like this I can bear,"So I am ridgid in my acceptance crietria, but at my early forties i am not going to accet styles I found unpleasant when I was younger.A friend of mine who is very knowledgable on jazz told me about this group, so when i found it at less that 4 USD in a used cd store, i gave it a shot. The musisians are maestros, the funk is bearable, the arrangements impeccable. its a nice surprise"
3,Interesting but to complicated for me,"I have this book. The raw materials are, at times weird. Too much work to do things from really scratch"
2,Boring!,"Nothing new, nothing special! Being free makes it good for reference for the novice cook, but if you are looking for more, you will be sadly disappointed."
4,I didnt know I had to kill the turtle...,"even if i never make any of these recipes, it was a very cultural experience. I took many a double take to the terminology and methods. very little veggie soups though.."
2,Soupless in San Diego,I love to cook and I love to make soups but basically this book was unimaginative and uninspiring. Also hard to read in the Kindle version.
1,50 soups,"This book is not for the modern kitchen.The Chicken soup recipe starts with ""Take three young Male chickens...""The Mock Turtle Soup starts out ""Take half a calf's head, with the skin on: remove the brains...""It makes fun reading but is not very practical as a cook book."
1,Description did not match the toy,"This is the first time I have been compelled to write a review on Amazon. Here is what the description said: ""Baby can pull and watch pal slowly climb up with the music. "" This is NOT the product I received. You can yank on the toy as with any hanging toy but there was no slow climb like we had expected from the product description.In addition, I happened to go to Toys R Us a few days after I received the package and saw the EXACT same toy for HALF of the price listed here from the manufacturer. Needless to say, the overall experience was negative. The toy is fine but did not live up to the description or the price tag."
2,Horrible colors + cheap quality,"I was very disappointed with the colors (a horrible flashy yello for the lion) and the quality, although for the price they are ok."
2,Too Troublesome,"It is loose for the iPaq unit by itself. You cannot put the unit with expansion pack in it. Also You must take the iPaq in and out to charge and sync with cradle. Unless you have the sync cable which does not come with the iPaq, it is so troublesome to use it. It does not offer any more protection, e.g. drop or rain, on the iPaq unit than the pouch the iPaq comes with. So, why (...) [purchase] it, I did and I still don't know."
2,Exec. Leather Style Pack won't work w/ Cradle,Be aware that the Exec. Leather Style Pack in only a leather case. It does not fit around the iPaq like the included Style Pack; you must remove your iPaq to fit it in the cradle. It is also just as big in your pocket as the included slip case. The Exec. Leather Style Pack is sized to be used without another Pack. (Your iPaq won't fit with another Pack on.)On the plus side it does open like a book allowing you to use your iPaq w/o removing it.I was somewhat disappointed.
3,Tight fit,"GOOD POINTS: 1) Fits tight - compact 2) Excellent quality BAD POINTS: 1) Must squeeze in with ""style pack"" 2) Does not fit with expansion pack 3) Need to ""squeeze"" Ipaq into and out of case to fit cradle (Like a swollen foot in a pair of loafers if you have the style pack on) which becomes an awkward daily ritual if you are on the go."
4,Really?,"I think the majority of these reviewers are reading the book with the intent to be offended. Fisher never argues that one sex is better than the other, simply that we are different and that for thousands of years we were equally important to society and we're finally getting back to that. She also states that we are all mixes of masculine and feminine rather than pure one or the other, that gender is a continuum rather than dichotimus. Everything she refers to is ""on the average"" meaning not true for all women or all men.Don't bother with this book if you aren't going to be open to what she has to say."
3,"Strange, pop-feminism sort of stuff","There's quite a bit of schlock here, so much that I want to read some Germaine Greer or even Camille Paglia after a few pages of Fisher's book. Women undoubtedly do possess greater abilities in terms of patience and open-mindedness; as a feminist I observe these things all the time. However, this is exactly the sort of book that makes Women sound as if they don't believe themselves to be good at anything; and this is silly, Women know that they are good at anything and everything. This would have been a daring book, even twenty years ago, but not now. And is the writing here really evidence of Women's superior verbal skills? No, afraid not; it's not especially compelling writing at all. I guess I just wish someone else had written this book."
1,Absolute tripe!,"This is the most worthless waste of paper I have ever laid my eyes on. To say that behavior is biological is to say that human beings are software driving bodies. Women and men behave the way they do because of SOCIALIZATION and there is only minimal impact from normal physical differences (insanities are excepted, as they are aberrations)."
3,hmmmm,"perhaps she is forgetting that the past 200 years are not the sum total of human history. is there a battle between the sexes in ""primitive"" cultures on earth today? she is looking at a one hundred year period as if it's much more important than the 25,000 years humans have existed. not very impressive from an anthropological standpoint, in fact, pretty short-sighted. anyone who agrees with me.... read Ishmael and My Ishmael by Daniel Quinn."
