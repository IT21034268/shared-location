4,Works wonderfully on squirrels,"When we were having problems w/ squirels scavenging and mucking around our backyard, we used this product. As far as I can tell, since we used the product, we haven't had any issues w/ squirrels and they haven't come back for quite some time even though we haven't sprayed again for many weeks."
3,Mixed results,I found that on some animals this seem effective but it depnds on the idividual and the area. The more sheltered the location the more effective this is - the more exposed to weather and wind the less. For example on my garden I have seen patchy results but on my sheltered garbage can area one application kept the squirrels out even with a cake box tempting them.The sprayer is fairly wimpy and if you had a large bush or headge could take a longtime and be much easier applier with a standard sprayer. It does also does not stay in its holder well and continually is found laying beside the bottle so be sure to lock the strayer before storage to avoid accidental leaks
1,Broken bottle,"Like another reviewer, the spray nozzle on my bottle broke within five minutes of the first application."
3,Seems to work,"I use this to keep squirrels off my deck and away from my flowers. That seems to work so far, but I figure it will wear off. I haven't been through a rainstorm since I first applied it, so I don't know if that will wash it away."
4,"Use Early, Use Often","Aside from the issue of the product arriving with a leaky seal, we got this thing working just fine. We live in a ruralish area with a host of animals, particularly deer, that enjoy nibbling on just about every plant we decide to try in the yard. The motto with this stuff should really be to spray often. We've been using Deer Off products for years and while they don't smell great to humans, they do work if you continually apply the product. So far so good and the sprayer's been the best part because it's less work for all of us. So, best if used a lot and as long as you're not expecting a miracle because some animals are gonna slip through anyway, but this is certainly helping keep the plants a little safer from surprise guests chowing on them."
5,Squirrels Beware,"I have to say I finally got this little critters from running anywhere but in the tree.I was tired of them in my gardens and running all night on my roof. When you set up a perimeter of where you do not want the Deer, Raccoons or Squirrels to go. Spray and they will not come in that area. I sprayed and it worked just great. after thirty days I sprayed again, you do not have to use a lot.If you do not have a lot of rain it will last longer, overall good product."
4,Effective,I got this repellent primarily to keep squirrels away from around our bird feeder. I paid close attention to see if the product was actually working and I did see a s difference. Squirrels were still around but they would not come close to the area I treated with the repellent. The effect lasted for a few days (which is expected) so I am pleased with this repellent.The battery powered sprayer works well and it makes it a lot easier to spray. I do recommend this product.
2,"Urbanized ""wild"" critters are accustomed to man","I had high hopes for this product, as deer and squirrels tear my flower and vegetable gardens to shreds. This product works as advertised, flawlessly - BUT it does not repel so-called wild critters. Deer and squirrels initially were frightened by the sprayer action. However, the repellant odor did not deter animals from eventually taking over my entire garden.I talked to a county fish and game official; he opined that urban animals are too accustomed to man and his many exotic sounds and smells After three days or so, the deer simply ignored the spray of repellant. They are persistent pests that won't hide in terror on seeing me. Believe me I am quite scary. I am proceeding to evaluate other tactics.Bambi and his kin are safe for the moment."
4,Worth Trying,Most of my garden these days is in pots on my back porch--but even then the deer reach over the top rail and eat down my beans and peas if they are too close to the railing. This product sprayed on the railing seems to work.My main interest in this spray is for my poor cedar trees in the winter. I'm hoping it will prevent the deer from eating the leaves on the lower branches. If not . . . then I'll go back to putting up a fence.
2,Not Practical for My Needs,"I tried this product and it does appear to be somewhat effective at deterring critters from bothering garden and flower areas for a while. It turns out to not be practical for my needs because of the relatively limited working time, and the relatively large expense of the product. I can not afford to continue to apply this product to garden and flower beds. The area I live in is experiencing a drought so a garden is a particularly attractive feeding ground for animals, so the product might work better in areas where animals are not so stressed to find food."
4,"Mixed Results, Overall Effective","We live in a wooded area and squirrels are frequent, and in some cases even deer. We have used the product, and at first it did not look as if it were working, but then used a higher quantity and it did."
4,Worked good,"I have a problem with squirrels jumping on my bird feeder and knocking all of the bird seed all over my deck. I sprayed this solution on the outside of the feeder and the deck railing and the squirrels have not been back. I also used this on my plants that my many wild rabbits love to eat, they haven't been around either. My neighbor also uses this and loves it."
4,"works well, other options","I live in PA. Deer have eaten my roses, strawberries, tulip bulbs, hibiscus plants and even my kiwis. I sprayed the product around my remaining wisteria bush and my beleaguered Kennedy rose bush that is on its last leg. So far I don't see any new damage. If you Google homemade deer repellent you may wish to mix your own. Otherwise this seems to be working on the deer. My new red-tail hawk neighbor has kindly helped out with the squirrel population."
4,Rapid,"I've tried a variety of products intended to repel varmints from my attractive and yummy garden patch. The best repellent is a fence or cage that can keep the critters out. I haven't taken that ugly route, and have lost a lot of plants in recent years to rabbit and squirrel foraging. For spot locations, I think products like Deer Off can work. I found this one to be so easy to use that I got the job done quickly and I didn't suffer any trigger fatigue from constant pumping. The price seems high, but for some plantings, it's a lot cheaper than replacement. Time will tell if the critters stay away. So far, it seems to be working."
4,Gardening troubles considerably reduced,"It is wonderful that there is a safe product that can be effectively used to keep deer, rabbits, etc. from eating plants and vegetables. Since I have been using this Havahart DeerOff the repellant effect is terrific!"
2,Not effective; battery-intensive,"This product is supposed to repel deer by smell and taste. I'd have to say it doesn't work at all. Deer were eating my marigolds prior to spraying. After spraying on a dry, windless day, the deer continued (they come in early am before dawn) to eat the marigolds. Worse, now they've taken an interest in the buds of my lilies and coneflowers, which they have never eaten before! So I went back to spraying with Bobex, which is expensive, but works.The battery-operated sprayer is another problem. After spraying for ten minutes or so, I could hear the batteries were dying. I maybe used a third of the contents, and the batteries were near dead. I think the idea of adding even more batteries to our landfills is a bad idea, to begin with. Make a high-quality manual spray pump instead, that's my suggestion. And, of course, create a product that actually repels deer!"
1,Fail & Fail & Fail,"I was only able to ""spray"" with this for a minute or so. Then the spray turned to a stream which dripped off of everything. I changed the batteries thinking that maybe the batteries that came with it were old, but that didn't help at all, so it's a mechanical fail.I'm a person who cares about the environment, and the packaging disturbs me. The holster is plastic and doesn't have a recycle number on it, so that will end up in the landfill. The battery powered sprayer doesn't either, so the outside of that will end up in the landfill. Even though I'll see what I can do about recycling the insides, I'm sure many people won't and that will also end up in the landfill. To save the earth I'd rather buy this in a gallon jug and use my own pressurized tank sprayer than fuss with a battery operated sprayer. Environmental fail.I put this in my own tank sprayer. Even after three applications on my purple coneflowers, the squirrels are still eating the flowerheads. Product fail."
3,"I like the sprayer, the repellent ... not so much","I selected this item because I thought I'd be able to use it in the vegetable garden, where the rabbits are rampant. The instructions on the container say it's safe for ""plants"" but there's no mention of whether it's safe for edibles, so I'm restricting direct use to the ornamentals, and spraying just the boundaries of the vegetable garden. The rabbits seem to be avoiding the garden -- so far, so good. I don't know if that's because it's late in the season and there are no more tender shoots, so maybe they've just lost interest. I'll try it next year, early in the season, and will hope it works better than other reviewers indicate.The sprayer works great, after priming, as my husband discovered. ""It doesn't work!' ""Did you prime it?"" ""Oh."" We got a nice wide spray that covered a huge outdoor coleus and the unidentified plant next to it (I really should save the greenhouse ID tags) with just a few easy pumps."
4,Very good for deer - some minor drawbacks,"I bought this to try at my parents' cabin. They have a major problem with deer eating their ornamental plants, specfically tiger lillies and hostos (or is it hostas).This particular product is nice because it the sprayer is battery operated. So my parents like the convenience.Now for the disadvantages... I'd rather smell my own flatuence after chilli than smell this. It's awful. But, then again many other chemical sprayers reek. Also, this is not a set it and forget option. You need to pay a lot of attention and reapply. Lastly, you cannot use it for plants that will bear fruit or vegetables for consumption.All and all it's a new twist on an old concept. I'd use it again."
1,Pretty useless,"I applied this repellent with ease (love the idea of a battery-operated sprayer) and a degree of optimism. Sadly, it did little to discourage the deer from making a meal of my flowers."
1,Not effective at all,"I live in a semi-rural area on about 2 acres with woods. We have lots of deer. I have never successfully been able to get my day lilies to bloom because they get eaten as soon as they begin to bud. I sprayed this liberally all over my day lilies and surrounding plants when they were full of buds. 4 days later the buds have been eaten - every one. Although it's easy to use and doesn't smell too bad, it simply doesn't repel deer. I would not waste money on it."
3,OK,"I am not sure this product is any more effective then pouring urine near plants but I suppose it may be easier to apply depending on where one is located. I do like that aside from eye contanimation it does not come with other serious health warnings. It does require reapplication after heavy rain and needs protection from freezing. Depending on where one lives, storage and frequency of application may be an issue for some. It does state the product is odorless to humans, one thing urine can't promise."
2,NOT FOR USE ON EDIBLES,"It doesn't mention this in the product description (but does on the bottle), but this product is not supposed to be used on edible plants. Well, I'm a vegetable gardener with a rabbit problem, and if I can't spray it on things I'm going to eat, it's useless to me. This, despite saying it's safe for use around kids. Had I known this from the description, I never would have ordered it.It does get one star because my mom uses a product with the same active ingredient on her roses, and it does keep the deer away (although it stiiiiiinks).If I get brave enough to ignore the warning labels and spray it on the kale, I'll update."
2,Not in my garden!,"I have my garden behind an six foot wire fence. Unfortunately, one side of the fence is only 4 feet tall due to damage last winter. I used this product as well as an electronic aid to keep the deer away. The result was $60 in plantings and 40 hours of labor down the drain. It didn't my local animals one bit! Next year I will raise the fence and perhaps install a moat! Actually, I have a neighbor who had good results with just playing a radio in the garden. Guess deer do not appreciate good gospel music!"
4,Seems to keep squirrels out of our community garden,"We do have a community garden at my apartment complex and squirrels are a bit of a problem. So far, this is more effective than other brands and the sprayer definitely is a plus."
3,Arrived damaged. Really damaged.,"I'm unable to write a review for this item as it arrived damaged. As in, the box was soaking wet as the product itself had exploded inside of the box. Proper packaging would have remedied this problem. I just hope there are no side effects to it as we handled it before knowing the box was wet. It got on a hassock and on our skin and clothing."
4,Does what it says so far,So far so good. I had no problems assembling and using the sprayer and I haven't noticed any animal issues since the application. My only concern is that we haven't hit the rainy season yet. I'm not sure how the product will fare through our heavy rainfall but at least the summer foliage has been saved.
3,"works fairly well for rabbitts, have no deer issues",I can not say how this works for deer but did cut down on the rabbits. I have a lot less in the yard now. Easy to apply..
3,Not particularly effective,"I have tried pretty much every kind of deer management products on the market, and these repellents are marginally useful at best.Most repellents smell strongly and wash away after even a light drizzle. This product tries to correct these shortcomings. It does stay on much longer and the smell is much fainter, but herein lies the problem: it does not deter deer very well. Eventually, only the corner of my garden protected by theBird-X YG Yard Gard Ultrasonic Animal Repellerremains completely unmolested.I do like the battery-powered sprayer and plan to keep it for the regular repellents after this bottle is used up."
5,"Run, Run Reindeer!","I got this at a neighbor's recommendation and I am glad I did. I live in Deer Country and it is not uncommon to see deer strolling on local lawns even in bright daylight. This is an effective product and deer are repelled by the taste. I was surprised that this product had the flavors of peppery egg, which deer and small rodents apparently don't enjoy.Although this product has a bad smell, it is not overpowering and it does do the job. This does not have a strong odor and is not human repellent based on that.You get a motorized pupmp that runs on batteries. It does work well and it is easy to aim and spray. I would certainly recommend this. It is gentle on your foliage and other greenery."
3,only works till 1st rain,"Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, cheap price. Do not like having mandatory written reviews"
3,Worked for some animals but not for others.,"We were anxious to try this product because we have been having a huge problem with animals in our garden. The directions were easy to follow and the spray nozzle was very easy to use. However, the results were mixed. The rabbits and squirrels seemed to stay away, but the Deer Off had absolutely no effect on the deer that were eating our veggies. We used the product as suggested, but still the deer were getting a feast. I would not use this one again."
3,Sprayer is Great; Repellent Hasn't Been Effective in Our Yard,"As the title of my review says, the electric sprayer is excellent. It took probably a minute of priming (pressing the trigger with nothing coming out of the sprayer) during my first use before the spray started to come out; since then, it sprays right away when I pull the trigger.The spray stream goes about six feet or so, and it's easy enough to aim it at trees or fence or whatever. You can adjust the tip of the sprayer in order to make the spray more of less focused (that is, more stream or more misty).I'll use this spray bottle even after the repellent is gone. It will be useful for weed sprays, insect repellents, etc.The repellent itself has only been moderately successful in our yard. Our issue is bunnies and they haven't seemed to be bothered by the repellent - their activity in our yard after a couple of applications of the repellent is basically the same as before the applications."
2,My deer aren't scared by anything.,"I had to wait until late Fall to give this a fair review. The herd of about 13 deer around here have plenty of forage from my cornfield (and others). Starting in October they start eating the tree shoots, giving me a Bonsai garden of Japanese Maples. Sadly, Deer Off did not seem to hinder their taste for Maple, Cherry, Dogwood, and Mimosa branches. But then, my deer don't even flinch when you fire a loud pistol in their direction. I've gone back to putting fence around the trees I don't want stubbed any further. Which is a real pain.Maybe your deer are more picky, and will be more deterred.I was impressed by this little sprayer. Most battery powered sprayers are junk, but this one works well. I'll be finding some use for it around the home."
4,"Havahart Deer Off- deer, rabbitt and squirrel repellant",We used this spray on the pumpkins that we had outside. In years past the squirrels would chew into the pumpkins to get to the seeds. This year after using the spray I only had a little spot where it was chewed on one. The rest were untouched. there is a first time for everything.
5,"Besides doing what it says this sprayer is fantastic, I'm going to use it for all my gardening sprayables!","While we love to watch the deer come to the mineral lick we put out for them, we do not love the way they eat our shrubs & garden area. We sprayed the areas that needed protection from the deer & voila, It worked! I can't attest to rabbits as they are not a problem here but it is great for the deer in our neck of the woods (central TN)After using this battery operated sprayer there is NO WAY I'm willing to go back to pumping out products by a hand trigger again. I don't know why everyone doesn't have the option to buy their gardening ""solutions"" in a pump bottle like this, all my neighbors are going to get this after seeing mine in action. Just be sure to start spraying with the breeze blowing AWAY from you.... yeah, learned that the hard way LOL"
4,Helpful things to know,"God forbid we should ever need to know this information! The episodes contain very straightforward, practical things to do in case the very bad happens."
1,What were they thinking?,I wasted {$$$} for this! The gameplay stinks and the graphics are bad not to mention the hard controls. If Nintendo wants a game that is good then make a new game. I love video games and this is the only one that I hate A LOT.
1,"it blows alright, but not out of the water","this game is super lame. its as if all of the game designers were talking on the phone while they were writing the code for it. it's really hard to get involved and interested in the gameplay because it is sooooo boring. not only is it boring, but there is not much to it. there are only a few courses and they are all the same, except occasionally a pirate's ship is exchanged for a sailboat. i was forced to buy this and luigi's mansion w/ my gamecube and i'm pretty disappointed. (...)."
1,Could this game be any more boring........,"This game is soooooo boring..... I played for 5 min and was bored Dont waist your money, if you are looking for a great racing game with water go for SSX TRICKY, well snow is water."
3,It's Good But If You Want Awesome Water Games Get Xbox,This game has good water effects but the Xbox water in most of its games make Wave Race look like a dreamcast game. (Dreamcast is a fine system but its old).If you want incredible water effects get an Xbox it costs more but its worth it.
2,In the water.,"The game is good at the start of just a player one, but if your with two player's then it's a harder to go to the finish line.It's hard to slow down and turn to make the ramps, and i thought the game was going to be alittle better, but if you want it get it, but I'm not going to."
2,Don't waste your money...,I am sooo glad I rented this game first before I bought it! It is really hard to steer throught the courses and you get stuck on the shores. It isn't any fun for one player or for multiplayers. I would definetly recommend renting this game first to try it out.
3,No Complaints,This game is pretty good. If you like Wave Runners then this just might be the game you're looking for.
2,Dont get this...,"When you initially start playing this game i think most everyone notices the graphics first. THATS ALL THERE IS. Oh look at the sting ray , oh look at the coral. ... This game has no challenge and i was able to beat it in ummmmm.... 4 days. Its too easy, and the only thing that partially redeemed itself was the TRAINING mode, the fact that it actually gave you a selection of players and the fact of more levels but thats it. If you want more of a challenge you could find it on the version on the N64. I would recommend this game to a first time gamer but thats it."
1,Not so easy or fun.,"Waverace is not the game that looks and is good,it is the game that looks good and is very complex.The really cool part is the weather and how when you land the water splashs the camera.But when you do Championship it gets very annoying,I thought Championship would be just racing,not like ski slalom where you have to go on the correct side of the flag.It gets really hard because the waves in one course are said to be low but then they are like 6 ft. tall.I would recommend getting SSX Tricky."
3,This Game is so boring,This game is boring. I never liked Wave race and this one is just like it. I played it and it is worth ($). I also thought that they need more than 3 modes. I is a good game if you loked wave race but if you didn't don't buy it!
4,"A great game, but not good enough","You can get three new levels. Once you beat it you get the weather changer. Each level is fun and has shortcuts. The bad thing about this game is that you have to go around the yellow and red booies. I like this game, but I would rather have SSX Tricky. At least it's better than that stupid Dark Summit and PacMan World 2."
4,NOT GREAT AS NINTENDO WANT US TO THNIK,"Well wave race is one of the greatest water racing games avalaible but i also played splashdown for the ps2 and belive me is has better graphics than this, is right that wave race has better waves but that is not the most important, splashdown has more courses to choose from that wave race if fact they are 18 courses and i mena they are a lot, both games are coll but if you want a extreme looking game and a long gameplay i would definitily buy splahsdown"
3,Don't recommend it...,"Wave Race: Blue Storm isn't your multi-player-fun-kind-of-game. The Multi-Player screens are so little! First, let me tell you everything.Good Things:Fun doing stuntsGreat water graphicsBad Things:Dosen't save goodMulti-Player screen it hard to see.Boring after 2-3 daysGet aggravated easily!I don't recommend it, because of the save feature and the little multi-player screen and fact that it's boring!Now for the total review:FUN: 2/5REPLAY VALUE: 1/5EXTRAS: 3/5OVERALL RATING: 3Anyway, don't buy it. Rent it. If you're planning on buying this game, buy it USED!But if you want it anyway, go ahead. You'll probably regret it!"
4,PRETTY COOL,"I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE THE CHARACTERS ARE GREAT, THE LOCATIONS ARE AWESOME, AND IT'S ALL TOGETHER FUN!"
2,Bad game!!!!,"The graphics are ugly and unrealistic, and the racers don't look like real people. Not as good as splashdown or wave rally! It's not really that fun, except for the tricks. It looks like it could have been made 8 years ago! Nintendo's games are always really lame, little-kid type games, so i wouldn't recommend this for anyone above age 8."
1,this is for people ages 3and younger,first of all the control stink so does the characters and it gets boring after a day.DO NOT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Fun Game,The game is very good. I played the Japenese verson. The graphics wre not the best. I have seen better. Maybe because it was the Japenese version. Don't know.
4,worderfully wild waverace!,"This game rocks! Good graphics, and music. The waves and weather conditions are really realistic. You can either race or have trick compeditions. 2P is even more fun. A nice selection of characters each with different + and - adds some statagie to the game. The only thing I dislike is that there aren't any secret characters or anything. There are some special areas though, and by entering the right passwords, you can even try riding a dolphin. If you like realistic racing games, you won't be able to keep your hands off this one."
2,Glad I rented it first.,"This was not a fun game to play. It's aggravating - too hard to control, especially with the bigger waves. I would recommend renting it first before you buy."
3,"Good, but not as good as the rest","I thought Now 53 was good, but maybe not as good as classics, such as Now 51. The highlights of the CD were Ms Dynamite, Darius and Vanessa Carlton. However there were I felt some equally poor tracks, particularly the dance tracks and Atomic Kitten. The CD in my op[inion is average"
1,So not worth it...,"I'm a huge Axis and Allies fan, and I was expecting some great new things to come out of this book. I got it, and I was sorely disappointed. For example, it talks about each country and what they produced such as Germany and subs, America and bombers, etc., and tells you that each country will get free units based on that at the end of each turn. A good idea, but everyone gets almost exactly the same thing! It makes no sense... It goes so far as to include a ""Reduced Soviet Effectiveness"" rule making all Russian units -1/-1! Infantry that hits on a 0 attacking? Yeah, that's a good one... Sure, the Soviet units were of a lower quality in the war, but they had masses and masses of them to make up for it, which doesn't happen in this game.This book is frankly just not worth it. You can find thousands of new rules on the internet, and they won't cost you anything..."
2,Very mixed feelings.,"I purchased this camera about a year ago and have liked it for the most part. I'd have given it a three star rating if I weren't so frustrated at the moment. Recently, I've started to get a ""No Images. Memory Card Error"" message when I turn it on. I've replaced the memory card and am still having the problem. Sometimes turning the camera off and on again seems to fix the problem. Also, the shutter speed is incredibly slow. I've read the manual and called Cannon to try and turn off the red-eye feature and there doesn't seem to be a way to accomplish that to improve the speed. I've heard similar complaints from other PowerShot S400 owners."
4,Great camera,"Excellent camera, highly recommended. Only 4 chilis because it would be nice if they made the same with a larger display. I'm saying the same, not one with lesser optics like the SD200/SD300. I've taken almost 8000 pictures with it, very good."
1,MEMORY CARD ERROR!!!,"I bought this piece of sh** thinking it was a great buy...even found it on sale on amazon.com. Hhahaha..yea right. Canon is laughin all the way to the bank on this camera, because everyone who has purchased it, has gotten the good ol' Memory Card Error. My camera is USELESS. I havent even had it for 4 months, and this piece of sh** already is worthless and broken. Fu** Canon for making this Powershot S400."
1,It WAS a great camera...for a while,"I bought my S400 in August 2003 and it was truly a wonderful camera until July 2005, when I started getting memory card errors. The error occurred no matter which of my 3 compact flash cards I used. Then the camera refused to work at all. Canon is willing to repair it for $150 plus shipping and tax, and I'm not certain that it's worthwhile to do this.Please think twice before purchasing this camera. The current 4 star rating does not accurately reflect the camera's performance after 18 months or so."
1,MEMORY CARD ERROR AFTER 16 MONTHS!!!!,Total waste of money. I've called Canon and they won't do anything about it other than ask me to pay $150+ (can't remember exactly how much) or trade it in for an SD500 for $200. DO NOT BUY!!!!! I didn't even really use it that much!!!
4,Newer models available,"This is a great camera from Canon. I've always been a fan of the Digital Elphs and I've had this one for about 2 years now. Canon has since come out with smaller versions with more capabilities. So if you're considering this camera, I would suggest looking at the SD300, SD400, and even SD500 before making your decision."
1,memory card error!,"Well it looks like I am joining the queue to report a memory card error with the camera. When it works, it is a great little camera, my only (other) complaint would that there is almost no warning when the battery runs out, it starts to flash and then shuts down.However that was until the dreaded memory card error. I got this error with the 256M card that i bought at the same time from amazon. This card started getting memory card errors, which i could cure after reformatting - a problem if you have photos on the card.Thinking it might be a card problem, i switched to the original card that came with the camera, and lo and behold i turned that on after a week, and i get the memory card error, but this time, the camera completely freezes to the extent that I can only turn it off by removing the battery.I'll be contacting canon to see what they suggest.RegardsDave"
1,Taking out the internal battery worked,"I want to thank the poster who did the research to take out the internal battery. I think it's working, but I really can't tell. I would think that we need to replace the internal battery no? If you're going to take the camera apart, make sure you go to Radio Shack and get their precision screwdriver kit. The screws are size 0.0 not 0. As another poster mentioned, make sure you track which screws come out of where. There are three different sizes and it gets tricky putting it back.Oh and I just want to say that Canon really sucks. I can't believe that they didn't address this issue. My next camera will be a Nikon. I see that some SD400 customers are also complaining about a similar issue."
1,Memory Card Error,"I am getting the same memory card error as the other reviews. I have had the camera for about 1.5 years. I reformatted the card and the error went away, but now I am worried whenever I take pictures that the card will stop working."
3,Memory Card Error,"I have had my S400 camera for 17 months and have used it A LOT. Lately have had a lot of ""Memory Card Error"" mesages. I have bought new Memory Cards, but that isn't the problem. The problem is in the camera. It is very disappointing to not trust the camera to take a photo when you want it too. Very frustrating. Buyer Beware."
1,Memory Card Errors!!!,"Same problem as everyone else here...MEMORY CARD ERROR? To make things worse, CANON won't do anything about it. I bought the camera about 18 months ago, and it worked great, and now I am plagued with memory card errors, but I know that it is not the memory card, because I can use it in any other camera. I can't believe the rating here on amazon is still 4 stars with so many dissatisfied customers."
1,AVOID! Memory Card error!,"I am suffering from the same memory card error mentioned dozens of times among these reviews. We were quite happy with the S400 for the first eighteen months or so, and then started getting this persistent error that now has rendered the camera useless.The reason I am adding my two bits is to help bring down the average rating for this camera (which was still four stars as of this writing) so that the casual buyer won't just glance at the four star rating and think everyone is happy. We're not.Canon should be ashamed."
3,If you get the memory card error -after waranty has expired,"I too loved this camera until I got the dreaded ""memory card error"" after I had had the camera 16 months. Fortunately the credit card I bought it with doubles manufacturers' warranties so I am submitting a claim to them for the repair/replacement. You might want to check the benefits that come with your credit card before you send any money to Canon for repair."
1,Great pics until it dies,"My wife and I received this camera as a Christmas Gift last year. It took great pictures until we got the memory card error WHILE ON OUR HONEYMOON. That's right, we now have no pictures of our honeymoon. Thanks a lot Canon. This memory card error isn't a secret. Please try to put out a product that works for more than 10 months next time. I will never ever never ever never buy a Canon product again. I would urge others to do the same."
4,great but not the flash,"I have been using the camera for 6 months and its the ultimate camera for quality and compactness. Only weak thing is the flash, especially red eye function, it just does not work...I am very happy with it and reccomend it."
1,There ought to be a class action LAWSUIT,"I loved this camera...until the memory card error!!!!!!! I thought it was just me, then several people I know had the SAME PROBLEM. Then I saw all of the complaints online. This is awful, they need to be sued! They should not get away with not fixing this problem"
2,Watch out for warranty expiration! Will die right after!!,"This is the second cannon digital camera I have purchased and twice, immediately after the one year warranty expired, the camera failed.Canon has a policy that, after warranty, the camera will be repaired at a flat cost of either $150 for a minor repair or $300 for a 'more extensive' repair.I find it outrageous that, after spending $900 with Canon in the last 3 years, their products 'die' with 'memory card errors' immediately after warrantly expires (at 14 months!)Canon was totally unhelpful and unreasonable about performing the repair free of cost despite the fact (from other web reviews) this seems to be a common issue immediately after warranty expires.A Canon employee actually told me that she ""usually expects a product to fail after the warranty expires and would just throw it out"". I think that is a pretty high cost of $450 for one year use of a camera.Beware!"
1,Not worth,"I have a Sony DCR-PC120 NTSC Digital Camcorder, which comeswith 1.5 MEGA pixels digital still picture capability. It'spretty handy and it produces very good picture quality.Today I bought a Canon PowerShot S400. I thought its 4.0MEGA pixels capability would blow away Sony's 1.5 MEGA pixels.I used them to take some pictures with the same objects, fromthe same angle with same light source. The result is verydisappointed: PowerShot S400's picture quality nowhere cancompare with Sony's 1.5 MEGA pixels. The pictures from Sonyis much much clearer.Why bother to get a 4.0 MEGA pixels digital camera?? I'mgoing to return it tomorrow."
1,Huge disappointment and waste of money,"The camera worked fine with minor complaints for about 2 years. The zoom is not that great, up close automatic photos are ALWAYS out of focus, and the red eye feature doesn't work that well. I lived with the shortcomings, because it was a nice, small, convenient camera, but now it doesn't work at all. Like everyone else, I got the ""Memory Card Error"" problem. I lost some great pictures of my 3 month old baby, and now it looks like I need to start shopping for a new camera. I'm going to try the battery fix, but even if that works, I don't trust that it will keep working, and I don't want to lose any more photos. I'll never buy another Canon."
5,It has all been said,"All the reviews available really say it all. I can only say positive things about this little wonder. I have been using digital cameras only since 1994 and I can say this is the best so far. The size is great even for big hands like mine and it is very easy to use. Low light conditions require extra light, but when the light is sufficient, pictures are far better than I ever got with my Nikon film camera years ago. It is my second camera to exceed film quality. The last one was a Canon also. The investment in digital is well worth it since you have zero expense after camera, extra cards, and card reader are purchased. Bottom line: knockout quality in design, construction quality, and picture quality. This camera is a work of art that could be showcased."
1,Count Me In,"I bought my DigitalELPH S400 in late 2003 and now in late 2005 it has started giving E50 ""memory card error"" like everyone elses. Hundreds of people can't be wrong! DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA! Clearly this is a situation where Canon has a poorly engineered product and should be doing some PR damage control, but I get the feeling from other's testimonials that Canon doesn't care. Too bad. I won't be recommending any more Canon products and will be looking elsewhere when it comes time to replace my Rebel and ZR85. A class action lawsuit may be the only way to make Canon take responsibility for their product."
2,Great Camera - Less Memory Card Error,"I really like this camera, small, solidly built, takes great pictures. However, 2 years with this camera, and it appears to be toast. I'm getting the ""memory card error"" message that apparently many people are having problems with...not good."
2,"Enjoyed it for 2 years, then - memory card error","My S400 was purchased from Amazon back in May 2003, and last year I began to get occasional ""Memory card error"" which would go away after a few reboots, but a few days ago it became totally stuck in that mode. I've tried rebooting countless times, switched 3 different CF cards including the 32MB that came with it, and still got the same error. To be fair I've shot thousands of pictures (great quality) and hundreds of clips (mediocre) with it, and have dropped it from waist-high at least a few times. But it's still very disappointing to have a $400 piece of electronics lasted only a little more than two years."
1,Ticking Time Bomb - don't buy!!!!!!!,"This camera was so great when I bought it that I got 3 of them as gifts for family and friends. Now (18 months later) mine is unusable with Memory Card Errors, and my brother's is now unusable too (after 16 months)...just waiting for the other two gifts to go to crap.Canon's response? Pay $150 and we'll fix it!!!! THEIR OWN DEFECT!!!Do a Google search online for Canon and ""Memory Card Errors"" or Canon and E18 (another common problem)...see how awful this company is.Inexcusable. If they have a class action lawsuit against Canon, I'm in. I'll never buy a Canon again. It's too bad because when it worked, it was great.But it doesn't, so it's garbage."
2,Memory error,I am having the same memory issues as have been posted. I am pursuing a class action suit against Canon and will post information as I get it.
3,"Satisfied, great features and easy to use, except...",- No battery indicator until the battery almost run out - missed the pictures of most important moment :(- Small video screen (max 320x240)- Easy to get scratched
1,Memory Card Error Nightmare,"I am so disappointed with this camera. We purchased it 2 years ago for $500 and it started acting up with this memory card error message about 6 months ago. But, it would always work to turn it off and then turn it back on again and it would be fine however a couple weeks ago it just wouldn't ""come back to life"". It just said no image and had erased all my pictures. I went and purchased a new memory card thinking that was the problem but the new one did the same thing. I then emailed Canon customer service and they responded quickly however they told me it would cost $119 to send the camera in to be fixed or I could do the PowerShot upgrade program and get a Canon PowerShot S500 for $199 + shipping. I am so ready to purchase a new camera but after reading these reviews I am going to try the internal battery trick first. I agree - you could do better!"
5,Point and shoot? HAH!,"Many people say this is a ""point and shoot"" camera, and that's fine. They do, however, neglect to tell you that, especially for the tiniest 4.0 MP camera, this tiny camera has plenty of manual features to keep you happy with it once you've graduated from point and shoot-dom. The shutter, while not fully adjustable to be left open for any amount of time, can be kept open for up to 15 seconds and with an adjustable ISO up to 400 I've taken shots of stars I can't even see. It even lowers the noise on shots longer than 1.3 seconds. The aperture is the only qualm I have about the camera, as it's not adjustable as the editorial review said, yet I'm sure Canon will offer that in a firmware upgrade eventually. With custom white balances and special color modes rounding out this little giant, how could anyone go wrong? This is my first digital camera and it could possibly be my last!"
2,My favorite camera which got dead due to E18 error,"This camera was my favorite, but now dead and useless due to E18 error (the zoom lense does not retract) after 15 month of use."
2,Great Until Memory Goes,"After two years of better than satisfactory experience (image quality, ease of use), the memory error problem surfaced. The error can be cleared by reformatting at the expense of saved files. Canon offers no help or even acknowledgement of this ""adolescent mortality"".The S400 is the second Canon I purchased and I'm in the market for a 7MP camera -- unless they address the memory error problem, I won't be buying a third Canon."
1,Memory Card Error,"I have had the same issue that everyone here seems to have. Has anyone figured out a remedy for this?Canon is no help at all. They tell you that you can either: a) buy a used, refurbished camera for $199 or b) send it in to be repaired, which would cost AT LEAST $150."
3,Persistent Red Eye,"This camera takes fantastic outdoor shots of all types. When it comes to taking pictures of people-- say indoors at night-- you get a lot of Red Eye. There is a Red Eye reduction mode but it does not appear to help much. I wish I could recommend this camera but I cannot on account of the Red Eye problem, especially since a lot of my photography is indoors: casual shots of family and friends. Bottom line: a good camera but beware of the red eye problem if you are taking flash pictures of people."
1,Just stopped working,I've had this camera for quite a while now but a few days ago it just stopped working. I'm still able to view the pictures on the memory card but an error message (E18) comes up when I try to take a picture. I'm not sure what is wrong but this is the second Canon (the other camera was the PowerShot S60) I've owned that just stopped working for no apparent reason. I was planning to purchase the Powershot SD870IS but am now seriously reconsidering purchasing any Canon Digital Camera. They just don't last.
5,The best point and shoot out there,"After extensive research my wife and I chose the canon s400 for our digital camera investment. We could not be happier. Don't waste you time researching, if you want a point and shoot model get this camera!!!"
4,"Questions about Memory Card Error to L. Torres ""titililly""","I just this last week got the memory card error as so many other people have described. And it seems clear that the problem is with the camera and not with the memory cards themselves. Yet your solution (of formatting the memory cards) does not really do anything to the camera itself. Are you sure this method works and that it's not only temporarily cooperating before it starts giving you the same error again? Also, is there anything us consumers can do to get Canon to create some sort of fix to this problem w/o paying $150?"
1,shame on canon!,Same problem! It seems that it happens to almost everyone who bought the camera at the same time! And I paid 350 euros to change the lense!
1,Memory Card Error - camera is now useless,"Wondeful camera but very short life span. Mine is 24months old and can now only be used as a door-stopper since it has the Memory Card Error. I tried all the tricks I have seen in Usergroups but none work. Today the camera can not take a picture anymore. The local Canon service here can fix it for 200, but will it cure the problem or just produce a band aid? A new Fuji 5.0mpix starts at 250 so think go that route instead.Dan in Germany"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!!,"I thought I was crazy at first, but I am having the same memory card problems as all the other reviewers. I think the problem is with the camera but not with the memory card. I took the memory card from my s400 powershot and placed it in my canon G6 powershot and was able to download all the pictures and movies using the G6."
1,Similar problem.,"Ok, I'm not really under 13, if the review mentions it. I'm just not going to post under my real name. That'd be dumb.anyway, I'm having the same problem with my S400. Big surprise. New cards, no difference.Just great. Anyone know if this is a problem in the S410 as well? Or did they fix it there..."
5,Lovin' It!!!,"I searched long and hard for a digital camera for my husband. He often goes to various places and wanted a small camera to take with him. He loves the quality pictures I could get with my Nikon N65 and wanted the same ability, but with less bulk. We've gone several places and taken some awesome pictures with this camera. We're still learning all we need to know about using a digital camera, since it's our first, but so far the quality hasn't let us down.I would strongly recommend this camera to anyone who wants a good digital camera, with good quality pictures, and small enough to fit into your pocket (although I suggest a bag to keep it from getting damaged)."
3,order not complete,"Camera was advertised to include a mini tripod which I did not receive.Contacted seller,no response."
3,liked the previous version better,"great battery life, fast power on/off, fantastic size/weight, generally beautiful pics but...slow shutter speed (miss the great shots & if forced the pics aren't in focus) & very frequent red eye shots even with people with blue eyes & people with glasses."
4,Decent camera,"I've had this camera since October 2003, and I haven't had any significant problems with it. I have experienced the memory card errors as previously described, but only twice, and the errors were not fatal. As soon as I went on my computer and deleted the faulty photo, I could resume my photo-taking. I use my camera on a fairly regular basis - perhaps twice or three times a week. I haven't had any problems connecting it to the computer via USB cable. I chose Canon because their colors are more vibrant than those of other camera manufacturers. I would definitely recommend this camera for casual use."
1,LCD just broke,LCD just broke when the camera was in my pocket. I can swear that it was not impacted with anything. Cant see a thing on the LCD now. For what i had bought a $400 monster is useless point and click now. I have my mixed thoughts on it
2,"Same ""Memory Card Error"" problem with Digital Ixus","I've had the same memory card error problem with my Ixus, which I've had for two years. I just got back from Turin & the Olympics very annoyed that I couldn;t take pictures at the Opening Ceremony! Anyway, I unscrewed the front plate, lifted the plastic covered copper shielding & removed the small battery in the bottom right hand corner. A 2-minute wait, and then I replaced it. I had to re-format the memory card, but now it's working OK!"
2,I am so sad....,"I bought this camera about 15 months ago. It was amazing and I was very very happy with it. But today all of a sudden I saw a memory card error. I am so upset. I am a student and I saved and bought this camera and now it died on me as soon as the warranty expired. Looking at the reviews people have written I found out that it was not just me, a bunch of other people have also faced the same problem. I almost cried when I saw my camera had stopped working. I also see from others that Canon has a sucky customer service. The memory card error seems to be a inherent problem with the camera and its not the consumer's mistake. Canon should repair it free of cost. Its a big company but looks like they dont know how to stay in business. I am never going to recommend any canon products to anyone from now on."
2,"Yep, Memory Card Error","This is my first Amazon review, but I felt adding my voice to other consumers that have had Memory Card Errors was important. I agree with those who say this is a great camera...until it breaks, and then it's a terrible, untrustworthy device. Beware and keep your receipt and warranty information. Canon, please address this problem."
2,Problem in 4/5 months,"I am surprised to have a problem with the Canon Powershot S400 purchase made at Amazon.com. The shutter and lens would not open all of a sudden, when power ON is switched on. I get the error code E18.I hope this is not a widespread problem."
5,Truly Awesome,"This is a wonderful camera. I am disabled and have trouble lifting anything heavy, but this camera is so light I have no trouble at all. The picture quality is amazing and it has a nice appearance too. The only thing I don't like about it is the case that Canon provides as an option to go with it. It doesn't give you a place to store additional batteries, and since it doesn't allow for regular batteries, this is important. Overall, it's the best I've ever personally used."
1,MEMORY CARD ERROR TOO,"Like so many others, I experienced the memory card error. It renders the camera unuseable. I have contacted Canon and, thus far, they are not willing to do anything about it. I would strongly advise AGAINST buying this camera, because it seems likely (if not a sure thing) that your camera will stop working after only a short while -- for me, it was about 16 months."
2,Memory Card Error Club,"I purchased my S400 about 18 months ago. Memory Card Error started showing up a month ago....lost a handful of pictures due to the error.Called Canon - they told me that it was likely that one of the pins was loose. Not that I can tell. When I told them that I had researched this issue on line they said that all cameras have issues with these pins. I tried to find other complaints on other cameras - nadda.Also was told that if Canon knew something was wrong they would address it. Sounds like they're turning a blind eye here.Nice $400 paper weight. Not going to buy Canon again - I would if they would address the issue (camera was great before this enduring error), but to ignore it? sorry, moving on...."
1,Another Memory Card Error,"Like all of the posts, this camera worked great at first and then one day it just started malfunctioning with ""Memory Card Errors"" This was aproximately 18 or so months after purchase At first I didn't think much of it and the camera seemed to fix itself by simply shutting the camera off and then turning it back on. Eventually the camera would not even work. I even stupidily (is that a word) bought a new $75 flash card hoping that it was the card...NOPE, in seconds I found out it was indeed the camera. I too, tried to have this repaired and Canaon wanted to charge iver $150 to get this problem fixed. I would strongly suggest not buying this camera and taking the risk as one day you'll find yourself highly disapointed when your camera suddenly has a memory card error and you lose all of your pictures....."
1,This camera is for temperature-controlled environs only.,"This is a terrific little camera, and it takes great photos. The flash has a pretty bad redeye problem, but that's nothing compared with the real problem:DON'T TAKE THIS CAMERA OUTSIDE! Even slight (10-15 degree) temperature changes will corrode the inside of the camera, leaving it useless. And even if the camera is under warranty, Canon doesn't cover this problem. Yup. The camera is virtually destroyed because it was exposed to...humidity outside! This camera wasn't dropped in a puddle, left in the rain, or anything dramatic like that. I took it outside on warm humid days, and according to Canon's service department, that was enough to render it utterly useless!I see from other reviews that I'm not the only customer who has experienced this problem. My advice? Spend your $350 (plus the cost of an extra memory card, extra battery - altogether $600 for me) on something that will last longer than 6 months. What a total waste!"
1,Defective product with zero support,"Camera itself has good performance, but the product quality is very poor.After less than 12 months of fairly low use, the camera developed ""memory card errors"" rendering it unusable.Canon service was near zero, refused warranty coverage and charged $150 for repair.They changed a ""defective"" CF unit to fix the problem.Without telling me they also upgraded the firmware. This ""upgrade"" makes the CF cards unreadable from a regular card reader connected to a computer.In short: lousy product quality, dishonest communication and appalling support."
5,Best camera I have ever owned,"I bought this camera about 2 months ago to take to Afghanistan on my year long deployment. It fit all my requirements; small, 4 MP, and video. Perfect! It out shines my other camera, a 4.1 MP Sony. Recommend it to any soldier!"
3,"Gallo is awsome, camera less so","Gallo you are awsome. We tried everything with this camera, even calling the manufacturer. Extremely unhelpful - same garbage - send it in and pay them money for something they broke when building it. And when just a little fix will do. I was amazed that taking out the battery was so easy. I took all the screws out just to be safe but laid them to the side in order. Took no time to put them back.I would say that otherwise, the camera is durable and easy to use, especially for a young person. And the quality of the pictures is good for the time it was made. My daughter was 14 at the time and had no trouble using it. The only drawback is that you have to use their battery, unlike my Olympus which uses AA and when you're out in the woods camping, it's not likely you'll find electricity. So ease of use is good if you're always near an electrical source."
1,Me too,"Just to add to everyone else's tales of woe, I too have the ""Memory card error"" readout on my Ixus 400. It started off intermittently but is now permanent on my 2 year old camera which I bought in the UK. Canon should be ashamed of themselves!!"
3,"Great camera, wished it was more reliable though","For what it's worth, the camera is really fantastic. It works great when it does work, and it is light-weight plus compact. I've gotten lots of great use out of it. However, shortly after a year of buying it, I've gotten a memory card error as others have mentioned. I reformatted the card, lost some important images, and it worked fine for a while.Suddenly connecting it to the computer wouldn't recognize the camera. I thought it was the cord, or my computer, but it wouldn't work on 3 other computers, and getting a new cord didn't help. A call to Canon's support told me that I had to send it in for repairs and pay $150, or $185 to trade in for the S410 model. That's $100 less than getting a new S400.Needless to say, I'm very disappointed because if this camera had worked reliably and didn't have these problems, it'd be a perfect 5 stars from me. Sadly, this isn't the case, and I'm now considering getting a new camera that isn't Canon."
4,High quality and packed with features,"The only reason I gave this four stars is that, even though this camera is amazing (read the other reviews) it does not have the ability to put a date stamp on the images it produces. Therefore, when you download the images to your computer, you have to devise some clever way to do it yourself. Other than that, this camera is miles ahead of any other camera I've seen."
5,Great Camera,"This is the perfect camera for what I wanted. It is small enough to fit in my pocket, and it takes excellent pictures. I've had it for a month now, no big complaints. Occasionally i get a few blurry pictures, but that is mostly just user error. You just have to get used to the camera. Buy a large cf card, i got a 512mb which works great. Enjoy!"
4,Solution to the CF memory corruption problem,"It could be that resetting the camera to its default state (by holding down the ""menu"" button for an few seconds) initiates a soft reboot of the camera that is as effective as the hard reboot resulting from removal of the internal battery (and it's a lot easier). Any failures with either method?Note added: for a real fix the camera needs to be repaired by Canon. I gave up and sent mine in. Insist they not charge; similar models with the same problem have been recalled."
4,"Compact, light, great battery life and great pictures!","I got it for Valentine's day and so far I am very happy with it. The software is also great and easy to use (I used to have a Kodak camera and believe me, this is much better). Also, battery life is excellent.Manual controls and difficult to use, but after a while you learn the basic logic of the menus."
4,"Great camera, but concerned about quality","I love the size, the pictures and the features. I got it around Thanksgiving and by Christmas (in the middle of Christmas!) after 100 pictures and only 1 month of use it died -- with flash enabled (red-eye or automatic) it would not take any pictures. Left me without digital pictures for the first year since my daughter was born. My prior camera (a Kodak DC800) took 8000+ pictures over 5 years with no problems. I got the Cannon for size, speed and quality (4MP vs 2MP). I didnt expect reliability issues.Cannon was fairly quick with a turn around fix (although whats the deal with no RMA #s?) and they replaced the flash unit and sent my same camera back. Its working again, but I wonder for how long.... And while Christmas will come again, my Daughter's 5th one wont."
2,"Nice camera, until the ""memory card error""","My S400 has died after 18 months, thanks to the ""memory card error"" so frequently mentioned in this forum.It was nice (except for the underpowered flash) while it was alive."
5,Best compact camera,"This is the best compact camera I can find. Picture quality is excellent, plenty of manual adjustments for the casual user, build quality is superb. This camera is worth the money if you really want good prints. Much better than the Casio and Pentax compacts."
4,Camera Good- Repair Service Bad,"I purchased this camera in January of 2004 and by Easter 2004 it had been sent back in three times for repair. Canon's Factory Service Center in Elk Grove Village, IL is very poor. There is no toll free number to call and you're often left to wait on hold (long distance). The camera had a problem with the pins in the CF memory slot which subsequently ruined three CF memory cards. The manager at the Factory Service Center told me you should only use Canon compact flash cards or you could invalidate the warranty. However, when the camera worked I liked it's features and size."
5,"This is ""the"" camera","I have bough this camera after extensive research. A very good review site is at http://www.dpreview.com/.I got this camera because it the perfect balance of quality, reliability,compactness and simplicity. These are enough to make it a ""winner"" traveller's camera. It is the perfect design. I carry it in my front pocket, not bothersome at all.If you are looking for more controls, go for bigger models like A80 in the same price range.This camera still has many essential controls you would need. One thing I wish it had is fast shutter. This can only be achieved in continous mode. It can picture a 40 mph moving car as it was still.Extremely user friendly, very good material. Not perfect battery life. May need extra battery for trips.I would strongly recommend it to every traveller who wants to take good pictures with minimum hassle %90 of the time.The conclusion is, Canon rules the digital camera world. This camera rules the ultra compact world."
1,great camera until memory card error appears,"i got this camera in june 2003, and began experiencing the ""memory card error"" problem intermittently from the very beginning. since powering off/on usually cleared up the problem, i didn't pay it much attention.in february 2005, the camera pretty much stopped working altogether, and i haven't used it since. i didn't realize the problem was widespread, and now i am angry that canon is so unresponsive and won't stand behind their product.i really loved the camera while it worked; very easy to use, and it took good pictures. too bad it is useless now. i highly recommend that everyone call canon support to register this problem: 1-800-828-4040. make sure they take your name and information to be able to track these complaints!"
1,Canon Sux0rs!!!,"I too have just fallen victim to the infamous ""memory card error"" plaguing the S400 model produced by Canon. The camera is a bit shy of 21 months old and suddenly started spouting ""memory card errors"" left and right. Initially I thought the Simpletech memory card was to blame, but after seeing all these negative reviews on Amazon, now I know better. Canon should pull their act together and compensate their customers. Class action anyone?"
1,Yet another memory card error case,"I've loved this camera like no other gadget I've ever owned.So much that at least 4 friends bought one on my recommendation.But at 20 months the memory card errors started.A few days ago when I called Canon, the rep said he'd never heard of this behavior before.So tonight I did a web search and... WOW! I am clearly not alone.The biggest disappointment is not that the camera is failing,it is that Canon's management is failing its customers."
1,"Important: Camera worked great for 1.5 years, now is useless!","Hi,I am a reasonable consumer. So when I paid $400-500 for a product, plus the $50/per memory card, I expected to have something that will at least work for 3 years. Sure it might be slower than newer cameras, but it should still function.I've been getting the memory card error for the past 3 months, and I used to be able to just re-start the camera, or re-format the memory cards. Now, the camera will not work at all anymore.This is very disappointing, as there are many other brands out there with digital cameras, and I chose to buy the Canon based on the feedback from my friends and review web sites...but now I recently found out that they have pretty much written off this camera as well.It's a shame b/c it was a great product when it worked, but now I will probably never buy another Canon product for the rest of my life...what's the point in buying a brand name if it is just as cheap as the no-name stuff?"
1,Canon S400 is a poor choice - slow action - memory errors,"The camera is loaded with neat features, but the software is so slow, you can never get a good shot unless your able to have your subjects hold a smile for up to 7 seconds at times. Also, the camera started giving ""memory card errors"" after about 20 months. Replacing the expensive, 256 meg high speed memory card does not help. Canon has a defectivly designed camera model and refuses to stand behind their products. I now find that there are hundreds of people with the same problem and canon will not help them. I think its time for a class action."
1,Great until error messages...,"I literally got sick when I found this out.I love photography and this digital camera was my first foray into digital. For the 1st 13 months of owning this camera, I loved the camera; it performed wonderfully and I recommended it to friends who, unfortunately, valued my advice.And then, at 13 months -1 month after the warrantee ran out- I started getting intermittent error messages on all of my CF cards (regardless of brand). Now (15 months) it is all but useless. I have read the wealth of web info on this and will try two things:1)buy a CF card reader and reformat my cards (as recommended on some websites - however I am skeptical)2)contact Cannon and see if they are still playing dumbI feel ill that friends trusted me and bought this camera after I recommended it."
3,Memory Card Error,"I thought this was a great camera, I bought 3 on the same day for myself and friends. 2 of these have now suffered the infamous Memory Card error. Luckily it was under warranty and Cannon fixed the camera. While I was collecting my camera from the shop after having it fixed another customer was in there, returning his for the 3rd time with the same problem! My 2 flash cards are unuseable, Canon refused to replace their Canon 32 card and I had a fight for the shop to repace the 256 card. I dont expect it will be too long before my camera suffers the same problem again. My brother bought this camera just after me and I now feel guilty for recommending it to him. Beware!"
2,Memory card error...fixed (for now),"It seems that my experience with the S400 is very similar to everyone else's. I've had it for 18 months, and suddenly...Memory Card Error. I tried several different suggestions to fix the Memory Card Error, but to no avail. Finally, I tried the one below from C. Gallo of taking the internal battery out, and reinserting it. That did the trick! I didn't know which screws I had to remove to get to the battery, so I ended up taking all of them out. However, all that was required was to remove the front panel, which is held by 5 screws (1 on the bottom, by the tripod screw hole, and 4 on side by the loop)."
5,Mature Product!,Beautiful photos! Easy to use and well made. Very compact and excellent battery life. Highly recommended.
5,Great Camera,Have had this for 3 years. Worked great.Recently dropped it in the Colorado river and it still survived.So decided to write a review :) Camera does take great pictures and is very handy. Battery life is about 2 years and then you need to replace them.
3,Solution to the CF memory corruption problem - it works - for now,"I tried Ronald Jones' suggestion for fixing the memory card error problem got immediate results. So, for now, my camera is back in business. Many thanks, Ronald!"
2,too loud!,Felt great but the buzzing was WAY too loud and down right laughable. Try the Durex 'play' ring instead.
2,Not Much of an Enhancement,"I was intrigued by the idea of this product but was let down. The material is way too pliable to be a restricting, usable ring for him and the vibrating knob isn't placed properly to hit the right spot for her. Construction may not be the best, after one use I noticed some tearing of the on/off button cover. Cleaning is a snap. Not worth the price."
2,"Fun as a gag, but not as an enhancement to sex","As the title says, this item is not very useful in lovemaking. The vibrations are strong enough to produce sensations on both ends, but the clitoris is where this is needed most, on the penis it is not really effective as an enhancement. It's not worth buying if you're expecting sparks to fly in the bedroom (0r wherever you do it)."
5,This Hammer Should Be in EVERY Store!!!,"The is truly the first hammer that fit in my hand and didn't feel like my wrist was straining. I think this is because of the grip (nicely formed and good material) and the sizing of the hammer being 13oz. I think it is great that $3 of the sale goes to the SusanG Komen for the Cure. Most products now-a-days don't disclose the amount they ""donate"" to a cancer foundation.The product overall is a win-win for me. Good for me to use and benefiting a good cause at the same time. Good job Tomboy Tools!!I hope you make more stuff this great!"
1,not worth the money,"for $124.65, a hammer should at least speek chinese and have a homing device. this hammer has neither."
5,great,Not to heavy and totally useable for myself who is not a hanyman. Plus I love pink so I killed two birds with one stone!
5,No More smashed fingers!,"The coolest thing about this hammer ( beside the Komen donation) is that there is a notch and magnet in the head so it holds the nail - you don't have to. It is a good weight, well balanced and so cute in the pink. The men in your house are much less likely to run off with it - and if they do - it is easy to see the pink in the""family toolbox"""
2,Not much depth,"As an ""official"" guide, you would think that this was a definitive source of information to help with the many esoteric challenges that Quicken presents. As powerful and mature as Quicken is, it still suffers from an enormous number of quirks, particularly as it relates to on-line connectivity with banks and brokerages. This books simply does not proceed past the basic operation of each function and does nothing to help you fix or mitigate problems with share balances or, for that matter, how to really move to paperless financial management. You either need to endure Quicken's minor irritations, find another source of information, spend money to talk with someone at Quicken, or tinker endlessly. I was looking for some in-depth help and insight. It's simply not here."
2,what I recieved looks like a discounted/reject item,Please do some research. Your product does not fit the foto you are selling. See my cap's differences in shape and quality. This is hat number two (different model) from same shipper. Both were substandard quality.
2,Didn't work for my hair,"My hair is fairly fine in texture, but I have a lot of it. The conditioners I've tried tend to weigh my hair down, so I thought this conditioner was a safe bet since it would be weightless & not leave a residue. The conditioner was light & did give me volume at the roots, but it also dried out my scalp & left my ends very dry. My skin & scalp have a tendency to be on the dry side, but I have not had any issues with a flaky scalp before this conditioner. After the second time I conditioned my hair there were flakes all throughout my roots. I am so bummed that this conditioner didn't work out for my hair!"
4,light opinion,"Fo a reasonably priced light, It works well and replaced a light that had a very yellowed lens; this light is just as bright uses less energy; the mounting system wasn't the greatest; a couple of tap-con securely fastened it to the brick wall. I like it just fine"
1,Poor Engineering,I purchased several of these lights to replace some previous lights that had gone bad prematurely. I had one of the new ones that didn't work out of the box. The ballast is in the bulbs and they are expensive. It is just a poorly designed and engineered light. I would not buy them again.
2,Replacing a bulb? Buy a new unit!,"The light unit is great. Lots of light, no glare. When the bulb goes, well then the unit got fried. Replacing a bulb turned into replacing the entire unit. Kind of expensive."
1,not good,i bought this in January it quit working March 12 in 2012 about 34or35 days so stay away from this light fixture . i'm stuck with two lights to.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS LIGHT !!!,"The first one I bought lasted less than a year. Set up ladder and replaced bulb to find out that the internal electronics burned out. Ordered a new fixture from Amazon, set up ladder again and installed it. Dead! Nothing. Checked power, checked photocell, still DEAD. This lamp is a real shabby cheap China made piece of garbage. Now I am on my way to the Electrical Supply house to spend a little more and buy an American Made lamp fixture. Stay away from Lights of America Brand. You think they would check them out before they package them...."
2,Unknown defect,"Beware! The ballast is in the fixture, not in the bulb. So when it stops working you may end up buying a new fixture, not just a bulb."
2,"Bought a Pair, One is Already Broken","Installed a pair of these outside my garage back in mid November and one has already broken by the end of the year. Contacted Lights of America and they request that I send them the fixture to determine if it can be replaced under warranty. I have these lights installed on a timed switch so it would give me 5 minutes to 30 minutes of light to work around the garage or make my way back to the house. With the limited amount of time this fixture was used, I expect them to last a bit longer. I tried switching the bulb and it just would not come on. I suspect there is a flaw with the photo sensor and I will take it apart to direct wire the bulb instead of sending it back for warranty replacement. Take this into consideration if you want a reliable fixture for dusk to dawn usage."
2,Not Gold!,"The title of this item (Cables To Go 2456) says that it's gold, but the one I received, which had the correct number on the package, was definitely not gold or gold plated. It appears to have standard nickel plating (silver color). It's an OK piece, but not what it was supposed to be, and obviously not worth anything more than a cheap non-gold model because it is in fact a cheap non-gold model. It wasn't worth my effort to ship it back for a refund, but that's what it deserved."
5,Afghans on the Double,Afghans on the Double (Leisure Arts #102662) (Crochet Treasury Series)This book has a lot of very good patterns. I have made two of them and they are GREAT!! The patterns are easy to read and understand and they make up very fast.
4,Good pattern source,I like several patterns from the book but still trying to get the hang of crocheting with double yarn. The book contains many patterns and the explanations are clear and easy to follow.
2,afghans on the double by leisure art,the book seems to me to be more for intermediate and advance crocheters than for beginners like me and the illustration for new stitches for certain patterns could be a lot better !!!
1,Awful CD,"Well, I went to science class, and saw the tile. It was white, with black spots on it. There wasn't any dirt at all. People were stepping on it so it got a bit messy but it was still clean enough for me, probably not eat off of though. Then the roof was a grayish color.^^^ That is more interesting than Hilary's music will ever be."
1,Awful,"Hilary is just awful...her voice, her acting...just bad. Yeah, some unknown 7-year old will probably disagree, but hey, she has no talent in singing. She doesn't write. She doesn't play instruments. Hell, does she even sing? This puppet is a fake. Another comment, if you go to her Metamorphosis CD and look under reviews in fall of 2003...her dad wrote a review, I swear it, it was something about the people on Amazon saying she's ugly or something. I'll update when I find it, for now, peace out, and forget this awful singer."
1,None of the songs sound the same,"None of the songs sound the same which is a big disappointment, I was hoping to just get her greates hits but insted they have all been remastered and everything. Do not buy!"
1,Awful this girl stinks,"She is evidence that the music industry is failing, they are trying to make a quick buck on this girl by manufacturing her bony ass. Which mind you, has never sung before and has no experience. Now you people are comparing her to mogules? Pathetic. If you want to hear real female vocalists listen to Celine Dion, Joss Stone, and Michelle Branch."
1,Most Wanted? Ummmm... Yeah Right!,"Hate her, her music, her movies, and her dumb Stuff by Duff collection!!!!!! This cd sucks and her vocal talent is just as bad if not worse, Just like Lindsay Lohan and Raven Symone who also act and try to sing. At least Lindsay and Raven can act while Hilary cant do that either."
3,It's a pretty good album!,"Hilary Duff's most wanted album is pretty good. Her 3 new songs are catchy. She should work with Good Charlette more often. He knows how to write songs that flatter her voice. If she made another album with the vocal range like those three songs, the album would be perfect!"
2,What happend Hilary???,"Hilary's first two albums, Meatorpheis and Hilary Duff, were really good. My sister got this CD for her b-day, only because she liked the song Beat of My Hear. I really didn't like this CD. She sounded bad in Beat of My Heart, Break My Heart, and Our Lips Our Sealed. In Our Lips Are Sealed, Haylie Duff even sounded better than her. This was not a very good CD."
1,Recommended for all parents!,"""Most Wanted"" came in really handy when my wife and I were in the middle of potty-training our daughter a couple of years ago. Reading the little CD helped, but it was the pictures of Hillary that captivated my daughter. Although the CD didn't necessarily have that big of an impact on the actual training of my daughter, it made going to the bathroom a little bit easier for my daughter to do since she knew she'd get to look at the CD when she did good on the potty.Recommended for anyone with a child going through or about to go through the ups and downs of potty training. If for no other reason, buy it so that your child can have something to look at while they are learning the wipes...er, ropes of using the potty."
1,UMMMM.......No.... WHO WRITES THIS ?,"Horrible!!!!! First off. So who writes this? Not Hilary Duff. She's not a musican that can write lyrics. WTF. She shouldn't even be doing music! BUT Who ever thought about her doing music is just using her looks. Very smart but NO! She can't sing, she's got an annoying high pitched tone voice!!!!! Try taking the ugliest girl that can sing and try to sell music i highly doubt that would work. Its all about the image. WTF is up with hilary's sister?! OH crap the same thing is going on with the music industry. The LOOKS. Trying to bring someone with the name thats in the family to fame and stardom. STOP PEOPLE!!!! YOU ARE KILLING ME!!!! WITH JESSICA TO ASHLEE TO NICK TO ARRON TO BRITNEY TO HER LITTLE SISTER!!!!!! OMG!!!!!! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Not as good...,"I really have no idea what happened.Hilary is a pretty good actress as for singer...I'm not too sure.Most people know what Hilary doesn't have to best voice and isn't able to hit high notes as well as other teen singers.Like Jojo.When Hilary started singing.Her first few songs sounded great.Like,""I can't Wait"" ""So Yesterday"" and ""Why Not"".These songs sounded pretty good,but after that Hilary started sounding worse.In many of her newer songs she sounds like she is trying to hard and as if she were shouting.Besides that,she hasn't had too many great hits to make an alumb about it."
2,Okay album,"the only song i kinda liked on this album was ""the getaway"" but i thought some of the lyrics didn't match with the beat.But really i'd rank it as 1 1/2"
1,"God, enough blonds already","Well I thought Britney Spears and Jessica Simpson were enough pop blonds for the music world. At least their music was bearable. But Hilary Duff, a one too many blond, I can't stand. Her songs are so boring and bland and lack creativity. The lyrics are pointless. This is all a ploy by Disney to convince their unsuspecting viewers to listen to crappy music. They think that by making one of their actors into a singer will work becuse since people like the actors they will buy the music. Sadly, this has worked. Please, save some money and buy another CD."
1,Kids can be so dumb...,"After a whopping 2 YEARS of her career, 2 ALBUMS and being worshipped by people who merely share an age and gender with her, a greatest hits album comes out? About 3 new tracks, backed up by 10 RECYCLED tracks make this a complete waste of money.I know what you're thinking. You're giving me a ""not helpful"" vote because you think I just hate Hilary Duff. Look at the CD itself, people! No artist or band has been shameless enough to launch a ""greatest hits"" album after 2 albums, at least in recent memory! Why bother if you already have both her albums?"
5,this is her best album yet !!!!!!! hilary rocks davids world!!!!!!!!!!!!,"alright lets just cut to the chase if you wanna buy any of hilarys albums by most wanted because your getting everthing on this album your getting songs from her 1st album and her 2nd album and 3 of them are remixed and then your getting 3 brand new songs which are the singles wake up , and beat of my heart and another fun dancy pop/rock song break my heart. so please do get this album. cool fact. when the album first released it went # 1 on the billboard charts for 2 weeks!!!!!!! and she is most wanted"
4,My daughter loves this!!!!,My daughter got this CD as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it. She listens to it all the time.
1,Too soon,"It's mind boggling how an ""artist"" like Hilary Duff can release a Greatest Hits album like this when she only has had two studio albums, and not even one top 10 hit. Things that make you go hmmm... Most Wanted by who? The people who Duff and her camp milk money out of with albums like this every year? It really doesn't bode well for her credibility as an ""artist""."
1,Really Trying!,"This music gives me a headache! All of the songs are old, none new. Hilary Duff always gives me an extreme headache, and tries my sore nerves. The first time i got this cd i was so excited. I listened to it then angrily threw it out the window. (it was that bad!) The next morning, (Saturday) i went out with a mallet, need i say more. I threw the pieces away, but the next day repented and bought another. My favorite song is ""Wake Up"". Sort of. Though yesterday i flushed the smashed pieces of ""Metamorphisis"" down the toilet. This cd is really trying!!!! And annoying!!!! And really stupid!!! No more temptations please."
1,Honestly,"You know, the only reason why this chick is so famous is because of MTV. If you actually sit down and listen to this CD (believe me, I have) you'll realize that it's all just computerized. It isn't even Hilary's real voice! My brother has seen her in concert and says that she sucks. I wish that there were more smart people in this world, who didn't blindly love whatever the media puts out as being new and in style. If there was, we might actually have had REAL music today. Hilary has no talent at all and doesn't deserve anything she has. You can tell that's she absolutely fake and her cute, sweet, happy sunshine nature is all just for show. Her voice just sucks, she sucks, STAY AWAY!Oh, go ahead and vote no. To be honest, I could careless."
1,Most Wanted is Correct. For worst cd of 2005,I have nothing else to say. Even her 1st hit from this cd wasen't a hit.
1,Please Just Stop. Get acting lessons instead,"Hilary Duff shouldn't sing. There should be a national law saying that Lindsay Lohan, Ashlee Simspon, Hilary Duff and all those other no talent teen stars shouldn't sing. It's noise pollution. Beat of My Heart is the most obnoxious song ever. It's about absolutely nothing. She repeats the freaking title like 47 times. And Wakeup sucks too, but it's funny to substitute other words for all the countries she says she goes to. She's only had about 4 top ten hits, so why is she releasing this?"
2,"Most ""Unwanted"" A review by TigerLilly","The only good songs on here are:Beat of my heart.Fly.Why Not.Other than that, it's one of my Most ""Unwanted"" on my CD list.Her voice has changed, her lyrics have changed, well...HILARY has changed. She's not her old self, and I think alot of people have noticed that. She has what I would call... ""Too Hollywood-ish"" with a boyfriend that is 10 years older than herand a face operation, Hilary dosn't have that girl-next-door charm anymore. It's sad. Like Lindsay Lohan, Lindsay was the same way, girl-next-door with a good girl-next-door movie coming out, they both had it all. Sorry Hil, you're not a musician anymore.Thanx for listening to my review, from TigerLilly"
1,eew,"Hilary Duff has no talent. She can sing but her songs (I doubt she rwrites them) should be named something like, crappity crap crap crap.This is just another Disney Channel wannabee pop princess. Name one girl form Disney Channel who hasn't made a record. LIke Missy Q. She has terrible songs.HAlf of these songs are remixes. Wow. there are like, 2 new songs on this cd. How can there be a ""greatest hits"" CD if you don't have any great hits?"
1,Obviously Not Wanted,"Hilary Duff is an actress. She sould stick to her routs where people enjoy seeing her perform, and that is on the big screen or silver screen. She is definetly not a singer!Hilary cannot compete voice wise with the likes of Kelly Clarkson and Maria Carrie( 2 of the biggest women singers of today!). She just doesn't have the talent to stay in the limelight. She needs to go back to doing what i and many others enjoy seeing her do, and that is acting!Overall i would say to not even waste your time buying this album. The lyrics aren't meaningful, and Hilary has no idea what she's doing!"
1,Most Wanted...Guess Again,"I really don't like her and she has a very weak voice. Not strong and she can't hit those high notes at all. She's not pretty because all that heavy make-up makes her hot. The songs are weak and nothing you haven't heard 10,000 times before. Nothing new and just old boring bubble-gum pop. The worst part is that it is A RIPOFF OF POISON'S OPEN UP AND SAY AHH!!!! That is actually a really great CD and one of my favorites from the 80's. Just don't buy it.NOTE: This is the same review as the original version because they're the same thing but three other songs and the POISON RIPOFF COVER!!!!!"
1,HILARY IS A LOSER!!!,"This girl is got to be pulling a prank if she thinks she needs a greatest hits CD right now!!!Tell me what hits this girl had...none from her second album...""SO YESTERDAY"" was her only so called hit and the song rings true Hilary is so yesterday!!!The songs are just not that good...her second album was okay...the first album sucked...""Wake Up"" and her other new single...whatever it is called...are horrible!!!SHE IS SUCH A FAKE...LIKE SHE IS JUST A PERFECT LITTLE GIRL...SHE DATES A BAND MEMBER FROM GOOD CHARLOTTE!!!SHE IS JUST A LOSER!!!I HATE HER SO MUCH!!! The other teen queens like Lindsay Lohan and Ashlee Simpson actually have decent albums and songs...Hilary will never amount to their talent!!!SORRY SORRY SORRY TO THE POOR LITTLE 7 yr olds who think this is better than anything in history...THATS CRAZY...GET A LIFE!!! DONT BUY THIS CD...A BIG FAT JOKE...WORST ALBUM IN HISTORY...I LOOK AT IT IN WALMART AND LAUGH OUT LOUD!!!"
1,"Collector's Edition or not, it still sucks!","This is by far the worst album of the year. Hilary Duff's acting is bad but her singing is just absolutely dreadful. Bubblegum pop is by far the worst thing to happen to music ever. I also can't believe how high the average is for this junk. Four stars? You people have no taste in music what so ever!!!!! Trash like this is what is killing modern music. ""Wake Up"" is by far the worst song I've heard all year and I can't believe that the idiotic music video for that garbage got no.1 on MTV's countdown and what's even more outrageous is that it stayed at the top for several weeks. Hilary Duff and her counterpart Lindsay Lohan represent everything wrong with music and movies today."
1,"Damn, does Hilary Duff blow (no pun intended)","Actually all pop 'music' sucks. 'Nuff said. Buy an album worth your time and money instead, like ""Train of Thought"" by Dream Theater."
1,Almost made me cry...,"I was shopping around my retail store, when this kiddish karaoke machine was set up, and was playing Hilary's awful remake ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" (originally by the Go-Gos). A kid, about five years old, was singing along to this. I wanted to slap her out of it.Then, on her collecter's CD, she has the nerve to copy STRAIGHT off of Poison's ""Open Up And Say...Ahh"" CD.Sad. Buy The White Stripes."
4,Girl can Rock!,"'A kids review' lives up to his/her name when he she states ""Girl can Rock 9/10very good song tells about how girls can sing rock , not just boys."" That isn't what the song was about at all. That minor quibble aside, this is a great album."
1,The breaking down of the entire music industry...in one album,"This collection of so called 'hits' is the absolute embodiemnt of everything that has gone wrong in music nowadays. Digitised, manufactured trash which is hardly worth of a radio listen, let alone a purchase. What is even more unbelievable is that this talent-deprived 'singer' has only had two albums, if that's what you can call them. yet she is already releasing a greatest hits album, lending a new meaning to the term 'disposable'.A boycott of this album is a cry for quality music, and if you look for it carefully, it does exist out there. It feels like a waste of time even reviewing this album."
3,ughh... here's what went wrong,"In the first place, why even put out a ""best of"" album when you have only had TWO OTHER ALBUMS OUT!!?!?!? That was so stupid of her to think that people would buy this. The remixes sound OK, but not really great. Break My Heart, you can hardly even hear her the the dumb verses! I think Haylie Duff should get a recording contract, NOT HILARY!"
3,"Not the best, not the worst","Hilary Duff is certainly not the best singer in the history of music. However, she's definitely not the worst, either. If you're looking for something groundbreaking, then I suggest looking elsewhere. You're not going to find it here. What you will find in this greatest hits collection (how that's possible after only two full-length albums I don't know, but there you go...) is some decent, cheerful pop which is good for nothing more than putting a smile on the listener's face."
3,Average,"The first single, ""Wake Up"" isnt really a bad song, but not good as well. Same to the album. I hoped she released more thant two albums before releasing a Greatest hits album, so there would be many choices. Still, it manages to have the giggles."
3,Growth and Maturity,"Hilary Duff has sure come along way from the little Lizzie McGuire anxious about Danny Kessliers pool party. Hil is now the new Madonna! Shes got four albums under her belt, a fashion line, a fragerence, and a new single [play with fire] thats rapidly climbing the charts. She starts out with the multi-platinum hit wake up, and has other great hits in between. The '05 mix of Come Clean was insane! It sure will be in the clubs for a while!"
3,So-so effort,"The originals for this CD are as good as her other albums; whoever writes her songs is still aligned with Hilary's image and direction. However, with only 3 originals, it is hard to even do a decent review.The remixes are OK; the addition of a bass line to ""Come Clean"" makes it much more interesting; the other two I didn't even realize were remixes, they sounded so close to the originals. ""Break My Heart"" is good; I guess this is a cover?The other songs are the same songs from her other albums (Fly, Mr. James Dean, Our Lips Are Sealed) -- although ""Mr James Dean"" is good enough to hear again.All in all, a decent enough effort, although I would have liked to have her wait another 6 months and release a completely new album instead of so many rehashes."
5,So good,I know most people don't like her but I think she is really hot.He 3 new songs are really good:wake up 9/10Beat of my heart 9/10Break my heart 10/10That a really good CD. Every fan should have it .
4,Why didn't they put Who's That Girl on the regular CD?,"This special edition is impressive, but why didn't they put Who's That Girl on the regular CD? That would have made the album more dramatic, show more of her voice. They only made that 14-song CD 52 minutes long, but this one has more songs, probably up to 70 minutes or so. I wish that the label would have thought about putting more songs on the other version to give more for the consumer's money."
4,Moms and daughters love Hilary!,"My daughters love Hilary Duff! (As a mom, I appreciate her music, too.) They give this CD 4 stars instead of 5 only because they like the original songs versions better than the remixes on this CD. But ""Most Wanted"" still rocks!!!"
4,Girl can Rock!,"This cd is not bad..I especially like the version from the Go Go's --Our lips are Sealed,Beat of my heart, wake up and come clean 2005 Remix...A cd well worth the money!"
1,How is this appealing?? SHE looks like a s**t,"EWWW ! She looks like a prison inmate on the cover, shes trying ot be all badass and shes fugly as heck all bony. Her music is completely horrible, she sounds the same on every song. This girl cannot sing. You losers who brought her to #1, lets hope you can keep buying more and more cds cuz nobodys going to keep supporting her after this mess of a cd..."
2,GREAT,This is a great CD with all kinds of different songs. Its fun to listen too. People who dont like this CD are totally crazy. Any pop-loving/rock-loving music lover would love this.
3,Ok...ok...you rock already...,"As far as bubble gum pop goes, its fine. It has a beat that you can dance to and even the go gos cover ""Our Lips Are Sealed"" is faithful and toe tapping if unimaginative. Ms. Duff even manages to show an edge.My main complaint though is that she feels the necessity to constantly tell us that she can ""rock."" Its almost plaintive, as if we are not going to believe her. If she were less self conscious, she (and we) might have more fun."
2,Dissapointment but Id still recommend it,"This album mostly has remixes and remakes of her old songs. Some few new sogns but they sound very bad except for ""wake up"". I have been a Hilary Duff fan since her first album and her first album (Metamorphasis) was absolutely 5 star. Her second album was 3 stars and this album I give 2 stars.If you do not own this album but you are a Hilary Duff fan then you might want to pick this up because it has the classics like COme Clean remixed.I highly recommend her first album, it was truly flawless, relaxing songs. This album just basically wants to make money. I only recommend this album to hardcore Hilary Duff fans.-Sam"
4,Good,I went to a Hilary Duff concert a in july she was realy bad didnt dance didnt really do anything but i have to say her muisc is awsome! I luv all the songs on the cd. Her new songs Break My Heart and Beat Of my Heart are great! And i luv the rest of the songs
1,"I'm a fan, but this sucks!","as another reviewer has said, Most wanted is just an attempt by both mz. duff and hollywood records to cash in. the album consists of many remixes and remakes, but almost no new material. In my opinion, most wanted isn't worth the plastic it's copied on. a b-side record is never good, but when it's sold as something new, thats just wrong. Only for the diehard fan."
5,This girl ROCKS!,"For all the Hilary Duff fans out there, this is such a great purchase!! Not only are there classic favorites remixed with a rock flair, there are new tracks that are really pumped up and have a slight 80's vibe to them. Hilary is so talented and down to earth, you can relate to all her songs. This girl really rocks out in her new cd!!!"
1,"OH MY GOD, WHY??!","I'm not really a big fan of Hilary Duff but I do like some of her songs. Fly, So Yesterday and Mr. James Dean are good pop songs (possibly better sung by someone with a better voice). I liked the direction she was trying to go on her last album although it was a little much for her young fans resulting in a 50% drop in sales from her first album (which sold 3 million) but she doesn't really have enough credibility to sing that kind of music. Still nice try but since when has it been alright for a 17 year old with marginal singing talent, 2 albums and 6 singles, none which have cracked the Top 30 on Billboard been allowed to release a greatest hits/best of CD???!!! I mean my God!! I thought Backstreet Boys releasing a greatest hits after 3 US albums and Britney Spears after 4 albums was bad but at least they've been releasing albums for more than 2 years!!! I am so pissed about this...don't buy it!!"
2,Not realy good,"Hi, I have both of Hilary's cd's and i must say some songs are pretty good...she has a weak voice tough. she not ready for a greatest hit's album either. if you have both of hilary's cd's like i do i don't think it's worth buying this cd. the song's are pretty much the same exept for a few new remixes.(...)"
4,Hilary At A High Point In Her Life!,"after seeing this album online as a pre-order the anticipation for me to get this album grew more and more.As i saw it on August 16th new in the itunes music store i had to get it.So i did and i really like it.Alothough it could compile more tracks and reveal truely great songs,this album still makes a mark.Hilary Duff has proven herself to be a great actress and singer.With her higher pitched voice and her feel-good lyrics and beats this album adds even more hapiness with 3 brand new tracks.I recommend this album for any person hoping to get a taste of hilary duff's work."
5,Unbelievable,This is the most profound and creative effort of any singer of our times. Duff taps right into the heart of every soul and lights it up with cherryblossums.cherry cherry cherry cherryblossumsA beautiful musical light from an angel that knows no boundaries.Hilary you are a souless puppet product born of faceless corporate greed.
1,Ha Ha!! a Greatest Hits Already???,"don't you have to have some sort of Musical Talent to Merit a Greatest Hits?? don't you have to have at least One song that Counts to have had a hit??Hilary Duff&Lindsey Lohan are basically the same person&I bet Cash Money that Lohan's Greatest Hits Package is coming soon as well.Hilary Duff ain't showed me much as Music Artist,as a Actress, as a Tv Actress,etc....but hey if you can get over with two Albums&drop a Greatest Hits pacakge then more power to you,but how about a Greatest Hit???"
1,A very bad influence for young girls...,Shes telling young girls that they should just go out and screw around and be cool just cuz they feel like it. Shes dressing up like a geshia girl and walking around the town half naked. These recycled pathetic tracks are barely enough to pay 5 cents for.. let alone 14 dollars.
2,dissapointed!,"Okay, at first when i heard the Cd was coming out I thought wow! another great hit cd from hilary but when i got it it only had 3 new songs wich i loved but the rest are just some songs from the previous 2 cds i have to say i like dignity, hilary duff, and metamorphosis 1000000 times better. so, if you want to buy the cd just buy the 3 new songs from itunes the rest u can get from other cds 0f hil!"
3,Duff Redone,"This is just a repackaging of the stuff from Hilary's first 2 albums. Only 2 new songs, WAke Up and Beat of My Heart. Wake Up is pretty good; Beat of My Heart is rather childish. If you have Hil's first 2, no real need to get this."
1,Loser!,"Hilary Duff is a talentless hack. She can't sing, she can't act. God only knows how she made it in Hollywood. She has only had like 2 or 3 hits. Dare her release a greatest hits album! If this was really a greatest hits album, there would only be 3 songs on it. Avoid this CD at all costs!!"
1,o,you got to be kidding. this chick has a greatest hits album already? She never even had a hit~ She can't sing.
1,WHAT'S NEXT...LINDSAY LOHAN'S GREATEST HITS????,"Who knew that between the year 2004 and the year 2004,that all of a sudden you can be a superstar of music and release a greatest hits CD. That's incredible. Thanks to the the clueless, ass-backwards world of the corporate, moraless organizations, Hilary Duff makes U2, Elvis, Duran Duran, Led Zeppelin, Prince, Stevie Wonder, the Rolling Stones,the Beatles, etc.,and any other GOOD artist who released Greatest hits CDslook dull as dish water. Duff must be a genuius campared to these LEGENDS. The whole world should learn from ""pros"" like her. I heard that before the year is out, Lindsay Lohan's publicist plans to release her Greatest hits compilation CD. WOW, GOLLY. The whole world is looking forward to that."
1,When Good Artists Go Bad,"Hilary Duff you used to be okay. (Mind you never my favorite artist in the world) But then she goes and makes a stupid album entitled Most Wanted aka Greatest hits! Come on people! With 2 albums and shes already making a greatest hits? With only three new songs (dissapointing) and the rest all old or from her movies, this CD is an absoulte letdown. Be smart and don't waste $40 on this. It may be cheaper where you buy it but where I bought it $40!"
1,"Ladies and gents, i give you the singing anorexic!","First of all, how can Hilary Duff have a greatest hits collection already, she has only released two albums in the last couple of years. I doubt it if she needed the money so why did she waste her time promoting this cd. She can't even sing or act! Her sis is annoying too! I hope there are no more Duff sisters lying around the gutter somewhere. Please can someone tell me why this chick is so popular? her personality is cold and flat, well hopefully her little dream bubble will fade into has-been oblivion ever so soon. Someone give this lollipop a home-cooked meal."
1,terrible,but not as bad as Carrie Ugly Hideous Wood. I am sort of glad I bought this but Hilary is fake so she gtes one star.
1,Least wanted,"Hilary Duff along with Ashlee Simpson, Lindsay Lohan and others are a prime example of what's wrong with music today it has no artisitic creativity and is just junk with the intention of making lots of $$$$$$$$$$$. Pure flash and cash and no raw emotion of creative songwriting. For the intention of being marketed to mindless teenage sheep only liking what MTV and Disney tells them they should like. There is way better music out there that is real."
4,Most Wanted is good.,"I have to admit putting a premature greatest hits album is not the way to go but this album is good. To the person who says she doesn't work hard. What about her constant touring running around the world to promote the c.d. and other things? She does work hard for her career and if you say she doesn't just because you don't like her, you are ignorant about her career. Anyway I want to say that the special edition which is pretty expensive to me is a better buy as it has 4 other songs including another new song. Here are my rating for the newer songs:Wake Up 7/10 - I've heard this song way to much, but it is catchy and has a nice feel to it.Beat Of My Heart 7/10 - It's very repetitive but can get stuck in your head. The video is awesome too.Break My Heart 10/10 - Should have been the second single off the album, very catchy and feels like it means something.Anyway, I really think that people should buy the c.d. or not say anything bad about it."
1,TOTAL POISON DISS,"Ok, you're right. I just now created an account. I just want everyone to know, this is a Poison diss!!! Hilary is SO SO SO SO RUDE!!!! I actually was a Hilary fan, but this flip-flopped my mind. I can NOT BELIEVE she's dissing one of the biggest bands of the 80's, something Hilary probably could never accomplish.Ok, about the album, it's ok. She not that seriously talented. Some of these songs weren't singles, let alone hit. I'd back off this."
1,"I'm not a kid, I just haven't got an account!","I was very disappointed with this CD.1) I haven't bought any of her other stuff and I liked the song Come Clean but it sounds nothing like the original!2) All the songs sound the same.3) On some of the songs she really can't hit the notes and it puts you off listening to the rest of the CD!4) Her sister is on this CD making it seem like she is only cashing in on Hilarys fame!If you like any of Hilary's songs I would reccomend buying the single, don't waste your money on this!"
4,a good cd,this is a pretty good cd but she didn't do as good as she does though i think she could of tried harder and this cd is worth your money
1,give up music already,I hope she goes to school and stops doing music forever cause it's not her thing at all
5,LOVE IT!!,"WOW!! i'm really surprised!! i LOVE this album, every song is fantastic!! but one of my favorites is: WHOS THAT GIRL! i think it has the greatest vocals in this cd!!!!!!!Go HIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-)"
1,like one or two new songs,"in this cd it is all her old ""hits"" and like two new songs. its a pieace of crap."
1,BeatOfMyHeartBeatOfMyHeartBeatOfMyHeartBeatOfMyHeart,I'm 13 and dislike her. She sucks. Especially that song Beat Of My Heart which she constantly says the same thing over and over agian. Should just stick to acting you freaking lip syncher since you can't perform with singing with your real voice. Go be with your sucky unhelpful boyfriend because he certainly didn't help Hilary make a good song. Wake Up sucked. Stupid 5 year old songs including 5 year old voice. she needs to hire someone to become her stylists. If she has one fire the one she has and hire someone else! I can even write a better song than the Beat Of My Heart crap. It's called 'Stupid Pop singers Who Ruin Music'. Greatest hit my butt! should be in the stupidest songs EVER.
3,a money stunt,"If this is your first Hilary CD, you'll be amazed at almost all the song choices.If you have all her other CD's, you'll be amazingly dissapointed.Hilary fans have waited for 11 months to get new material. How could it take 11 months to record 3 songs, slap a few new sounds on oldies and call them remixes, and make a list of a couple other good songs? I don't have a clue. She has had merely two studio albums. It's way too soon to make a greatest hits and is clearly a way to scam the american/canadian (and now the UK) music audiences into paying $15 for 10 songs they already own and 3 new mediocre songs. The 3 new songs lack. Sure, Wake Up is good. Beat of My Heart as well. And i guess Break My Heart delivers. But after having such a great second CD, fans expected better than a few ""I guess""'s. And now they must wait another year for new material.For first time buyers: go for it and you'll love itOld buyers: do what you want but be prepared to be a little bummed"
1,Most Wanted? i don`t think so.,"Well well well...another pathetic excuse for a cd by Hilary Duff. First off, I don't see why in some stores you have to pay as much as $20 bucks for ONLY 3 new songs, which by the way are NOT the MOST WANTED. The rest of the songs we've either heard before or have been remixed. What's the point of this? You really can't be serious if you actually call this a cd. How the hell can ""Wake Up"" or those 2 other songs be Most Wanted if they had not been heard before. It's funny, most people will actually waste their hard-earned money in buying this cd of already heard songs and cheap remixes. They'll never learn."
1,More Artificial Music...,"The new Brittany/Christina/Kylie? Maybe; this dreck is for people who mistake the package for the actual product. The music industry is literally putting lipstick on a pig by releasing this creation's ""greatest hits"" CD. The target demographic shouts ""She's so hot!"" as the spend their cash on this refuse, never even trying to expose themselves to real music.This ""music"" stinks: its poorly constructed, derivative and boring. But if you keep buying this toxic muck, the record companies will keep making it. Stop the cycle, buy real music.."
2,Too Many Repeats,"I'm now sorry that I bought this CD with my own money. There are too many repeats of songs from her first 2 CD's. I don't even listen to this CD because I've already heard these songs before. If you already have her two other CD's, don't waste your money on this CD!"
1,Wow...a greatest hits album?!,"This album is Hilary's third release. Theres like, no new material, it's just a compilation of Hilary's ""best"". Hilary Duff can't sing. This album is evidence of that. I was able to put up with this, because she WAS a good role model for young girls. She didn't dress trashy, she wore natural make-up, she looked & acted her age.Suddenly, now, upon the release of this album, Hilary is no better than Lindsay Lohan. She's got huge veneers now (which she claims she HAD to get beecause her teeth hit a microphone & fell out .... smells a bit fishy to me) which look totally fake. This would be manageable, if the girl didn't lose about 20 pounds. She's turned into the anorexic that she said she'd never become.So, not only is she a bad singer, but she's a hypocrite as well. Why are people still supporting her?"
3,its an ok album for hilary fans,i love hilary but the only thing with this album is that it only has 2 new songs and the others are older songs or remixs. i feel like this isnt worth buying if your not a hared core hilary fan but has her other 2 albums. but if you have none and want a little feel of her music than this is for you. and for hared core fans this is really for you.i will only review the new tracks off this album becuase i have already reviewed most of these songs.wake up: fun up beat and nice to dance to. 8/10the beat of my heart: love it once again another fun up beat song. 10/10
1,Oh Dear God! Another Album!?,"Seeing that her first 3 albums were terrible, why would she make another one??? I sure hope she doesn't make a greatest hits volume. Her ""sucking in air"" almost drove me insane. Her squeakey high voice took 5 years off my life. Huh??? I think my mom is calling me. I can't hear now because her overplayed songs on the radio made me deaf. Save your money and use it on something non-Duff related."
1,A greatest hits album? That's Hilary-ous!!!,"I'm sorry, the above was a very bad pun. But seriously, a Greatest Hits Album!!?? She's only put out two and I mean TWO CDs. She hasn't put out any good singles (well, actually, she hasn't even made any good songs, but that's a different story), and she's only been a ""singer"" for a few years. This whole album is just a bunch of recycled bubblegum put into one very disgusting disc.I listened to Wake Up and it was absolutely insane!!!! The whole message of the song is this: ""Everyone knows me and my name and they talk about me and sometimes they even say things that are, like, not true! I just need to get away."" Sorry, Hil, but that's what happens when you're famous. The whole song is basically just that and some random words put in like ""London, Paris, maybe Tokyo"". Everything else on this album is pretty much, like I said, recycled bubblegum pop. Please don't waste your money on this. Just don't."
1,Just checking,"This is so bad! She's remixed her songs with worse beats and added that dumb and annoying 'Wake up' song, that I can't stop hearing on Disney Channel (Yeah, I watch Disney Channel sometimes, but is that YOUR problem?! No!) and I mute the TV each time it comes on. It's a pathetic waste of a sort of good beat, and she looks SO UGLY in that video. She used to be 1000000% gorgeous and the hottest thing on the earth, now she looks like she's dead, and she has her sister's ugly horse-like face. So, let's review that review. She's become very ugly, she can't sing (As if that's not obvious), her chest look even flatter than it used to, she's made the most annoying song ever, and I have officially lost all respect for her. Yep, that sums this whole thing up.Mike Morrison"
1,Awful.,"Hilary Duff, do us all a favor, and never ever sing again. She has one of the worst voices I have ever heard, even in mainstream music. Her voice is incredibly weak and nasally, and she has no range whatsoever. Despite all the editing done to her voice (and trust me, there's a LOT), she still sounds terrible. Her lyrics are pathetic. The single Wake Up, anyone could have written in their sleep. It's that bad. While some may find this 'catchy' at first, it very quickly becomes annoying.And for all those people who are curious as to who I think are actually good singers? Amy Lee of Evanescence, Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil, Kelly Clarkson, and Mariah Carey are all worthy of a mention, and much less of a sellout than bubblegum pop teen icon Hilary Duff."
1,Duff sucks,"God what is wrong with her she's rich enough to get the best singing coaches in the world but no the girl thinks she can sing word to the wise Hilary Duff and I hope you read this. NO EFENSE BUT GO BACK TO ACTING YOU CANT SING YOU ARE A PRETY DECENT ACTRESS BUT STOP SINGING YOU SUCK, GOD! Now just know I meant that in the nicest way possible, I mean your a nice girl but I'd rather hear a microphone screek than to hear you. well actually that's what she sounds like."
2,"She's going down ""Hil""","I don't own this album and personally would never want to. I do have Metamorphosis, but I bought that when I was 15 years old. I listened to a few songs on here because of an article I read stating the worst albums in each genre. This was one of them. Being a former Hilary Duff fan, I decided to check it out.If you like a girl who's trying to be in the rock genre, but doing very poorly at it, this album is for you."
5,I LOVE HER MUSIC,"i can't understand why people hate her so much,i have the CD and it has great new songs and remixes.my favorite songs are ""the getaway"",""wake up"",and""break my heart""!know i know why it hit #1 at the Billbord charts.GOOD WORK HILARY."
1,HILARY DUFF IS AWFUL!,"you call this crap music? It brainwashes people to be weird girly-girls! Skip this! Don't waste your money, buy Skye Sweetnam's Noise From the Basement instead of this whiny baby-like voice.If I met Hilary I'd slap her 100 million times and break her vocal chords. And trust me it when she'd sing it wouldn't sound much different. She stinks!!!!!What a b****!!Signed,Sharada & Skye S."
4,CANT WAIT FOR HER NEXT ALBUM,"Most Wanted:Ok what is it with all the Hilary Duff haters out there, i just dont get it. This album is very good for Hilarys devoted fans and for those people who have not yet heard what this Girl can do. A nice few couple of hits put into this album along with some great new songs.i really liked listening too this album, i thought it was really great too hear all of Hilarys best songs one after the other"
1,Most Wanted? How about getting a hit first?,"It's mind boggling how an ""artist"" like Hilary Duff can release a Greatest Hits album like this when she only has had two studio albums, and not even one top 10 hit. Things that make you go hmmm... Most Wanted by who? The people who Duff and her camp milk money out of with albums like this every year? It really doesn't bode well for her credibility as an ""artist""."
1,Who wants to kill a Duff?,"Hilary Duff - Most Wanted.Lame songs, nonsensical lyrics, terrible singing, ugly girl. Period.Buy this album if you're a huge fan of this shrinking racoon who looks more and more like her horse face sister each day. What an animal farm.Enjoy her album."
1,At least she has a pretty face.,After listening to this I need a Duff. A Duff beer that is.Its the only way to enjoy this album.
1,"Awful, DO NOT BUY HILARY DUFF","You people are nuts! Nice? Talented? Good voice? She is an absolute disgrace. Hilary needs to go back to the Disney Channel were she came from and let us forget she ever existed, because believe it or not Hilary Duff fans, there is actual music out there - You just need to know where to look!"
1,Garbage,"Anyone who likes or buys this music is because of one of the following:1) 5-years old or younger2) Person who thought this was a p0rn CD.3) Had $20 to waste, if you did this you made a very good choice.4) Person who thinks Hilary Duff is hot (she is pretty hot after all)If your not in those 4, please go get a brain surgery. Thank you."
1,"well, at least she's pretty","hilary muff, she is 18? Hell i don't know, it's meant to make money and make money it does. the cows have been milked again."
1,Yuck,"Hilary is one of the worst and overrated singers ever and this collection of horrible songs should be rightfully called as worst songs instead. Only losers listen to lousy singers like Britney, Justin Timberlake, BSB, NSYNC, etc. This album is a total joke from the beginning to the end and come on why would anyone want to listen to a singer who lip synchs at concerts, does not write her own songs is beyond my comprehension. Don't buy this horrible compilation. AVOID. Get something better. Natasha Bedingfield's album would put this trash down.Another thing I should mention, this is a TOTAL POISON DISS!!! How rude Hilary! How dare you steal their cover!"
5,WOW!,Hilary is doing great after the show Lizzie McGuire! She has three new songs and some of her old songs are remixed! She even has her sister singing on here! It is amazing and you should definately buy it!
1,This is ridiculous.,"REALLY, REALLY ridiculous. Hilary Duff has been in the pop music scene for two years and now gets a greatest hits album?Why do you think No Doubt got a Greatest Hits album? Duh, they've been around for almost twenty years and have about fifteen singles, six albums that are all masterpieces.Hilary Duff has had minor hits and two albums. They are far from being a masterpiece. How long do you think it took No Doubt to get famous? Took nine years. That's nearly a decade. Hilary's happened overnight(Sorry I took that from another reviewer)No Doubt got a contract because of their musical talent. Hilary got hers because she was on a stupid TV show and the record company want to make as much money as possible. Bottom Line: They didn't care if she could sing or not, they just wanted to make money out of this cow.If you want a band that is worth your time, check out No Doubt. Their music is awesome and they won't be a band that you will be embarrased to have liked later in life."
1,Miss McSnuff is SO YESTERDAY!,"First thing's first. Hilary McDuff is the biggest wannabe losser in the biz. I've got to hand it to her, she SUCKS. People get sick of her self-absorbed ""ME me and only ME!"" reputation. For example, ever seen that pathetic Kohl's Candies brand clothes commercial with Madam McDuffy as the spokeswoman? They actualy play her ""hit"" Wake Up throughout the entire commericial. As if bombarding images of the girl stripping the store of its shelves to buy everything aren't enough! Sheesh! Listen folks, Hilary Duff's only fans are 8-year-old little kids who think they're ""big"" and try to act like their older teenage siblings. Guess what? Teenagers all HATE the Duffs!"
2,Sorry Hil...........,"Sorry Hilary but this is DEFINITLY your WORST album! The songs 'Beat of My Heart' and 'Break My Heart' are almost the EXACT same! At least the music is. And what is wrong with your heart??Most of the remixes except Come Clean, you can barely tell a difference. Hil, I think you should've, instead of remixing old songs-write new ones.Also I think it would be best for your 'rep' (though I could care less) to write you OWN songs for once, maybe even without your sister."
3,Little Soon for a Greatest Hits,Altough I like the Song Beat of My Heart I really thing that is not time for a Greates Hits CD. I should of been a whole new CD...
2,innocent hilary but lyrics badd,hilary duff is such a cool person but her beat and lyrics in her most wanted album is just not good. her first album was probably the best i ever heard and the beat just got worst and worst
2,Lacking,"Pretty book, but the number of latin definitions is poor. I bought this book so I could learn the latin meanings behind plant names, but there are so few definitions in this book that I'm going to have to buy another one."
4,gramabikki,I have had this camera for quite some time and it still works. The only part of the camera that is not perfect is the slide on the back that turns the camera on. I am now having some trouble and have to slide it more than once sometimes to get it to turn on. The camera itself is a very good camera. HP is a good brand. I have been very pleased with this product.
2,No questions asked,"This otherwise well-written book, is way too conservative when it comes to interpreting the story behind it. It is basically a remake of E. Lessing's ""The Adventures of Odysseus"", and E. Bradford's ""Ulysses Found"", and does not really present a PLAUSIBLE journey for Odysseus. It is disappointing to find that there is no critical challenge of any of the locations the Greek and Roman historians concluded upon 2000 years ago."
2,Broken at arrival,"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas, and when we took it out of the box the drawer was broken. It would not open and then when we finally got it open, it would not stay closed. I read reviews about the drawer not working and I should have listened. Defiantly would NOT recommend!"
2,Zillionz talking register - just OK,"My son was very excited when he saw this in the store, and was thrilled to get it for christmas. But he was disappointed. It's kind of flimsy, and to use the scanner, you have to put stickers on the items that you will want to scan...so either he mucks up his toys with stickers, or my stuff with the stickers, and it's hard to position the scanner exactly right on the sticker to make it work. Plus, once the stickers get scuffed, they won't scan properly."
1,Coins jam and drawer is difficult to open,"The coins jam because the window area that allows you to see the coins is too wide. Thanks for adding a screw plate to unjam it. The drawer is difficult to open. I thought you needed to be in a specific mode, but you just need to press the open button really hard. The drawer is too small and there isn't anywhere to store the scanner tags. Built solid, but they really need to make some improvements."
3,Child cash register,We were looking for an item my 5 year old granddaughter could learn math and money value. A great teaching tool.We took the scan bars and mounted them in a homemade book. Afraid they woul fall off items before long.She is developing sorting skills and learning about money values. She was always playing pretend store so this will help develop her skills on how things work.One problem we found. The money has to be removed from drawer before moving the register. If not money falls under drawer and keeps the drawer from functioning properly. Only remedy is to tip register on back and shake coins then turn register upside down and pour coins forward. The drawer does not come out.We are trying to teach her to put coins in bags like cashiers.
1,Broke after two days,This toy was fun.....for two days : (The circuit board burnt out and half the toy stopped working. Returned for a refund and won't bother with a replacement.
3,Great features but....,"I asked my brother to buy this for my daughter for Christmas. When we opened it, the register drawer opens but we can't closed it prompting my husband to open it and check the cause of the jam. Then after less than a day of playing with it, the microphone stops working. My kids also get frustrated when scanning barcodes as its not that successful most of the time. I am a little disappointed as I thought it has all the great features that I want for a talking cash register. I just hope the manufacturer of the toy reads customer reviews so that they would know how to improve their products. Oh though I knowit automatically turns off when not in use, I still hope it has an on off button."
2,Why did I ignore the reviews?,"Gave this to my daughter for Xmas and the mic broke within 48 hours. She is so disappointed! Worse yet, this is a gift from Santa and my girl is 7 years old, so returning this presents a bit of a problem for me and lots of explaining. I guess I should not have ignored the other reviews. It's cute, but if it breaks so easily and disappoints a child, what's the point?"
3,birthday cash register,"The features are good, when working. After two weeks the cash drawer would not open.Not much fun for a seven year old."
3,Decent,"The register has some good bells and whistles.However, the cash drawer sticks unless you press down really hard on the button.I wish they included more scan stickers for the prices.My daughter enjoys playing with it, but she complains about having to press down so hard on the button."
5,For a 3 years girl,"Was a Christmas gitf, she wants a cash register. When she open it, was very excited. Likes to play very much. Good material and construction."
3,Great idea but scanner only worked for a day,My daughter received this toy from her cousins for Christmas. It worked great the first day but after that the scanner no longer worked.
4,Not perfect but very good.,"I decided on this cash register because it had so many fun options. I loved the bar code stickers which I copied onto address labels so that we had plenty of pretend things to buy. If you line up the arrows, the scanner works most of the time. We had no trouble with the drawer like some reviews mentioned. The mic however only worked 5 minutes. My niece did put her mouth on it and I am sure she got saliva in it but I think that is what lots of children would do so I think it should have been able to handle that. My niece loved the mic and was pretty disappointed when it stopped working but still enjoyed other aspects of the toy. We gave the mic plenty of time to dry out and hoped it might start to work again, but no luck. Overall, I still think this is a good choice- not perfect but very good. I paid $30 and got free shipping. Considering the pure junk I have bought for $30, I am pleased with the purchase."
1,Broken,I bought this for my grand daughter. When she opened it on Christmas Morning it doesn't work!!!!! She is very disappointed!!!
1,Dont Buy - Rarely Beeps and Keyboard makes no Sound,"Bought this as a Christmas present for my 3 yr old. Sticker prices are far too difficult and inconsistent when it comes to using the scanner. Eventually did not work (bear in mind this is ONLY January 2012 and Christmas was only a month ago). Putting numbers in manually did not work either. For the price - rubbish. Buy a cheaper one from Toys R Us. Was going to return it today via UPS, but it informs me that it MUST be received by 31st January for a refund. Even if I take it to UPS now (29th January) - most likely won't get there in time.........Very, very disappointing.........."
4,satisfied customer,My girls love this cash register. I would recommend to anyone looking for a nice cash register for their child or loved one
4,Cash Register,It is really fun and the learning is exceptional the only thing I have a problem with is it's durability. You have to be extra careful while playing with it so if you have a child who is really rough with toys then maybe this may not be the right resister for him'her.
1,had to return twice- piece of junk,"son got for Christmas and was so excited, the drawer was jammed and could NOT open so we returned it and got a new one and the SECOND one the drawer's spring came out and the drawer didnt stay closed and the scanner didnt work! piece of junk this thing is!!!! this is ridiculous we should not have to return a toy TWICE - DO NOT BUY THIS"
2,Not complete,"While the cash register is a fun toy for my grandson, there was no play money included as stated in the description.NO MONEY INCLUDED! Is there a way to have this money sent to me?"
2,Cash drawer does not close,There are some reviews stating that the cash drawer does not open...we had the opposite problem. The drawer does not fully close! We returned it.
2,cj,"My son just got this yesterday and so far loves to play with it. But, the drawer is very difficult to open and I can see where this might be a source of great frustration. The scanner doesn't seem to work real easily either. You have to have it placed just right to read the price."
5,LOVE IT!,"I bought this for my kids for Christmas and we love it. Both of my girls, 7, and 2 1/2 can operate the register and use the scanner. And just a hint: scan the barcodes into your computer, print them out on sticker paper, and then you can have all the extra barcodes you need. I also bought the Melissa and Doug wooden pantry food and wooden fridge food to go with this - the wood makes a nice firm, smooth surface to put the barcodes on. I really recommend this. I particularly recommend Fat Brain Toys as the seller - others were selling this for $60, but I got it for $33 and Fat Brain Toys shipped it in less than an hour after I ordered it. This company is SERIOUS about getting your stuff to you!Melissa & Doug Wooden Pantry ProductsMelissa & Doug Fridge Food Set"
5,How neat!,"How neat is this? A toy cash register that keeps up with today's technology. My kids especially love the little ""barcode"" stickers that you can put on and easily remove from most items. The microphone works well, and they love to play ""grocery store"" with the register! Also acts as an educational aid too, as the number buttons are a calculator."
5,Love it,My kids love this toy. Their friends want to play with it right away when they come over. The money looks real and the scanner and microphone are a big hit. I'm glad I bought this. Hours of fun.
4,peffect register,Very pleased with this cash register my daughter loves it she enjoys adding up money. This is a great teaching tool for kids just learning to count money.
1,Drawer doesn't open,"The cash drawer does not open consistently when you press the ""open"" button. Very frustrating for a 4 year old. Also, the microphone only worked intermittently. Returned after a week."
4,Fun,Our 2 1/2 year old really enjoys it. The scanner doesn't beep all the time (maybe we're doing something wrong) but he has played with it a lot. He talks about money all the time now. The only problem is that we also have a 14 month old and he has tried to swallow the coins multiple times now. We have taken out the coins and only let him use those when the baby is asleep.
3,Broke the 1st day with limited play,The kids received it for Christmas....Stopped working the same day!Kids are very unhappy!Waste of your money! Don't bother!
2,A waste of time and money...,"We just bought this today from another shop, we came back home, and removed all packaging - disappointment - the drawer does not open at all. The make of the toy is flimsy and poor quality. We are very much unhappy. We are returning this tomorrow!!! There are a lot of toy cash register to choose from and yet we decided on this, as my daughter likes the idea that it talks and scan the barcode, besides that - the barcode scanner doesn't scan all of them (which we've found out), the drawer goes 'ca-ching' and that's it folks! It could be a FUN toy for children (if made with better quality and all works) but for now - the money it's worth - do not waste your time."
1,How do you contact MMP LLC?,"I bought this cash register for my granddaughters last August 10, 2011. It worked for about 6 months. Then nothing but problems. Batteries were changed, no talking, no scanning. My grandchildren are pretending that the pretend cash register works!!! When I tried to contact the seller, using the email address they supply, I got an error message and it was undeliverable. So now what? This is my very first bad experience with an Amazon purchase in 15 years of shopping on this website. Someone needs to help. I don't have 35 dollars to donate to anyone for products that only last 6 months."
2,What a waste!,"I bought this register for my 4 year old for Christmas. I never saw any barcode stickers but we did find that it would scan real barcodes but they all came up as 4.99 or .99. I liked the microphone and the fact that it kept a running total of the barcodes. I didn't like how they gave more denominations of money than there were slots for in the drawer. I would have lived with all of those things, the reason I returned the register was the drawer would not open. We were able to pull it open a couple of times and that was it. When I went to the store to exchange it I saw 3 that had obviously been returned on the shelf. I opened another box and tried to open it's drawer and it would not open. That is when I decided to return the item instead of exchanging it. Bottom line choose another register unless you don't want to use the drawer."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this product for my 8 yr old niece but when I opened the box I almost immediately decided to send it back. The construction of the toy seemed very sloppy. The stickers were not placed neatly on the toy and just from the look of it, it didn't seem very durable.I did return it and was immediately credited for my purchase including the shipping price, which I did appreciate. Customer service was very good."
1,Sounds stopped functioning 3 days after we received it!,The sound effects stopped functioning only three days after having received the toy. No more cha-Ching when theRegister opens. The toy has gone mute--all to my five year old's dismay!! Not highly recommended!Price is too high for something that's going to bust after 3 days of play!
3,Really? They expect a 4yr old manage 0.99?,"My toddler love to scan bar-code in supermarket, so I thought this toy could encourage him to learn some simple math on top of that scan. However all the scan results come in the form of .99 (i.e.: 0.99; 1.99 ...) I wonder how many 4 yr old can understand that.Lucky I tried the toy before I give it to my son for his 4 yr old birthday. The one I received randomly stuck with one word like ""divided by, divided by ..."" none stop. No key would work till switch to French Mode. When switched back to English, it would randomly stuck with another word none stop, like "" clear, clear, clear ....""Glad the return to Amazon was hassle free. The refund was in a timely manner."
4,My Opinion of YOUniverse Talking Cash Register,"This toy keeps my daughter (who is almost 5 yrs old) very entertained. She loves to play with it...especially the scanner. It's very realistic and the microphone is a plus. The only negative is that the scanner is very unpredictable as to whether it will work or not. The red light always lights up but it doesn't announce a price most of the time. Overall, it's a good toy and keeps her entertained."
3,"Good Toy, lots of functions","This toy cash register is lots of fun. The kids love it and it will be a good learning tool for money and math in the future when they're older. The scanner was great, but only worked for a short time(the first day). The calculater and microphone are good functions and hopefully will keep working. I threw away the play coins because they were really small chocking hazards, but the paper money is just fine. The price was a little cashie, but hopefully we'll get a few years of use out of it. The shipping was fast and it was packaged well."
1,Huge disappointment.,"I bought this cash register for my son and I blame myself for not reading the reviews first. I would expect a much better quality for the price paid. The drawer of this cash register DOESN'T OPEN AT ALL( or if you are lucky , it will open once for you) . It opened only when I unpacked this item from the box , and removed the play money from the inside . After closing it , I couldn't put the money back, because it kept getting stuck. I decided to return it , and purchased another brand ."
2,Drawer Does Not Open At.All,"Would be a great toy if it worked. The drawer came stuck closed. It took EVERYTHING my husband and I had to pry it open only to find, it was not just jammed. The lever inside never lifts high enough to release the drawer. So it is unusable. Zillionz must know about this problem because I have seen the other reviews but continues to sell without fixing the problem. I read the reviews before I purchased this but thought the drawer was getting jammed due to kids shoving things in the drawer incorrectly. This is not the case. Great idea but POORLY made. Very dissapointing because the other features of this cash register are very fun."
2,Truly Dissapointing,"Drawer does not open....at.all!! The lever that releases it inside does not lift high enough. I did not try to return it because my kids had already torn into it, excited to play and the rcpt and box were thrown out but what a joke! I saw in the reviews that this has been an ongoing problem with this toy. I bought it thinking the money was causing those drawers to stick but now I see this is just very poorly made. The company should not continue to sell something that clearly doesn't work. Too bad because I love the idea and all the other features. If it were not for the malfunctioning drawer it would get a 5 star rating."
3,Good but not great,Perhaps it was my expectation. This is good for scanning and pushing the numbers for hearing and reinforcing the numbers. Little way for a child to put in money and have it say what was put in which I hoped for. It seems durable and is good just not exactly what I wanted from an educational point of view.
5,Love these soaps!,"I not only purchase the Pre de Provence soaps for myself, but I give them as gifts. Everyone loves them!! They last a long time, and the scents are marvelous. Great product!"
3,Bubbles don't float,"Purchased this as a gag gift for our boss. The sayings are funny, but the there is a design flaw in that the bubble wand doesn't clear the bubble juice holder high enough for the bubbles to float. They pop right away."
3,redundant,If you purchase each one of the books for each of the archangels you will find that much of the material is redundant. It would have made a better book if all four books had been consolidated into one book since the actual information on each angel is sparse and several chapters are duplicated across the books.
1,Glitchy and constant ads to join monthly,Hard to install and keep runninng. After install you MUST connect to the internet and sign in to play so NOT good for a child who you don't want on the web. Also at this point it sucks you in to ares where the child can only go partway and then it prompts you to JOIN AT $7.99 a month.So much frustration for the child since the best the have is only IF YOU PAY BY THE MONTH!!!I HATE THIS MANIPULATION.
2,"Main game didn't work, no help from company","My six year old likes to play around with the Typing and Music disk every once and awhile, but the main disk never would install correctly. I reinstalled it four times in a row and always had an issue with a .exe file when trying to play the game. Emailed the company, four months later no response back. I've heard that issue with customer service with some others somewhere else too. If it works, it's an OK product (3 stars at best), but if it doesn't even work properly it's hardly worth even the $20 I paid for it."
3,not very educational,"The kindergarten was very good but, was disappointed with this release. I felt like the games were just that - games. I saw little educational value in them except the fractional pizza game. I will try the [...]though to see if this was just a fluke."
2,No. No no no no no,I can not stand this bloody story. It lacks basic order or structure and the copy I received was poorly translated. Whatever emotion the author was trying to convey was lost under a sea of errors that I just couldn't ignore.
2,Disappointing,"As a big fan of the compelling and insightful human interest to historical culture, this genre of books provides, this particular one was not good at all. The translation is stilted and poorly conceived, or maybe the narrative is just that bad! Do not waste your time and money."
5,Incorporates historical as well as fictional characters,"Will Turner is in his early twenties and desperate to fly in Chris Davey's The Aviator's Apprentice. The century is young and aviation is just beginning. Will is in Florida, hoping to make a name as a pilot and aviation engineer. When Europe is plunged into World War I, he is commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps where his ability and bravery are tested to the limit. The first in a planted series to be called ""Will Turner's Flight Logs"", The Aviator's Apprentice is a tightly woven and highly recommended novel that incorporates historical as well as fictional characters in an authentically backgrounded and detailed adventure story set in the early years of aviation."
5,This is a great and addicting game!,"This game is so much fun! It's really easy to get into, then you're totally addicted. This game has awesome replay value. When you beat this game you can play it over and over again, and not get bored. This is a fun game for anyone."
4,Superb!!,"From the moment I saw Pikmin, I was hooked. I got my Gamecube, came home, and popped Pikmin in, and happy to say, that I wasn't disappointed! Pikmin is a masterpiece! You play this little space guy, who crash lands his space ship on an alien planet. And you have to use the pikmin to find 30 mission parts to your ship in 30 days. I love this game but, it had some flaws. In some cases the controls are bad, and the day are waayyyy to short! (The last like 15 mins) and It does get a little repeditive. But, Pikmin is one of Gamecubes better titles! I recommend for younger and older gammers!"
5,Beat Day 1,"Can we say... Brain Power?!Anyway, to beat day one, do this...Get the Onion to upground...Pick the Pikmin...Chop flower...Take pellet to Onion...Get Pikmin...Cut down other flower...Take pellet to Onion...Get Pikmin...Move the Box...Get Pikmin...Find the Spaceship part...Bring the part back to the ship...Day done..."
5,A game Cube Must Have,"I was seriously considering getting rid of game cube and picking up one of the other systems, as I did not see any quality game cube specific games out there. Purchasing this game has changed all of that. The hope is that the future of game cube is as promising as the innovation and creativity displayed in this game. I won't go into detail about the game as that was done in many of the other reviews. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for a game that is refreshingly different from all the other video games out there, then this one's for you."
4,Short but good.,"First of all, this game is FUN. Collecting three colors of little alien pikmin to kill enemies and get ship parts is FUN. But, there are a few problems. First of all, only 15 minutes a day? Yes. There is only 15 minutes each day and only 30 days. Why? It made me more hesistent to play this game. It was as if 1 wrong move and it was the end. Be prepared to repeat days LOT. Other than that, it is pretty good."
3,"It's OK, I guess","It's to challenging. I f you like a challenge, get this. It's not that fun but in a way it is."
3,Its pretty good,"This game is sort of fun. Its great when you first buy it, but if you have other games, you start playing them more often after 2-3 days. Also, when you have freinds come over, its embarassing to show them this game ( probably because it sounds like pokemon,which is dumb anyway )I wouldn't reccommend this game to anyone."
2,A waste of my money!,I think this game is cool but the fact that the camera is really annoying. Also I hate being timed. I am agamer that likes to take my time and time runs out really quickly so I find myself struggling on the second level! I want to find a place to trade this in for Sonic.
2,Rent but don't buy,"Ok, I bought this game, and I was impressed. The graphics are incredible, the story is original (if juvenile), and it was all around amusing...for a good ten minutes. Pikmin then begins to devolve into something little more than brainless drivel. The concept seems fairly difficult before you play the game, forcing you to control not only the half-inch Capitain Olivar, but an army of quarter-inch centurions. After playing the game, you realize how infantile the gameplay actually is. Great gift for small children, great to rent if you're bored, but don't make the same mistake I did...don't waste fifty dollars on this game."
2,this is not a good game,DONT get this game its very boreing and slow its inovative but just not goot at all thank god i rented this game its not worth 50 bucks go get luigis mansion Pikmin is not worth renting 2 times
2,Come on Nintendo...,"When I heard gamecube was going to be oriented towards kids, I didn't think it would be this bad. The game takes elements of strategy games, but totally dumbs them down to make a more child-friendly game. It looks great and is fun for a few hours, but by then you've beaten it. Like the rest of Nintendo's launch games (other than star wars, but thats not a console-selling game), it doesn't offer enough playing time to warrant buying it. Do yourself a favor and just rent it to save yourself the agony..."
2,Not quite cutting it,"This game is very disappointing. Here's the storyline: A midget hero trying to fight giant birds and animals and gather ship parts with ""people"" even smaller. C'mon!!! The creators could have done a lot better than that, although I can't argue its originality. It starts out pretty fun, but gets old, fast. Unfortuneatly, the game seemed more of a task, than as entertainment, and thus was not very fun. Furthermore, I never was motivated to beat the game, and resent wasting my money. I advise you to keep your money, but if you ever find it on a $5 rack at some garage sale, who knows, you might enjoy it."
3,"Cute, But Frustrating...","This game was very challenging and at many times frustrating, especially when you end up losing all your Pikmin and don't realise it until you really need them. I am not a very patient person, and I could see that for many people, this game could be very frustrating and annoying. Overall, though, it was very cute, but not fun enough to buy."
3,Way hard,"This was my first game i ever bought. And usually people like the first game they get to death. Not me. This game started out to be way easy and i was lovin it. Then level three came around. Way too hard. The time limit is too short. So when Pikmin 2 comes out, get it. Because it is 2 player, and has no time limit. Although by this game if you are the kinda player that doesn't kill himself if he doesn't beat a game after 3 years of playing it."
2,"Very tedious, slow game","This is ok for the first few days, but then it gets way to boring. Always having to make more pikmin, while battling creatures, watching out for your existing pikman, and trying to find a stupid part all at the same time. And, you only have 30 days to find 30 parts. I have trouble finding one a day, much less getting it to the ship. If you love the arcade style Nintendo games, youll love this one. Otherwise, dont waste your money."
5,"Looks silly, but actually a great game!","This game looked really silly to me and I wasn't sure why we even decided to rent it, but we ended up becoming addicted and buying it.Don't be fooled by this game, it's actually a really good game and my husband and I both are addicted to it.. in fact he's playing it right now."
5,GET THIS GAME,"My Gamecube is supposed to arrive tomorrow and i can't wait. I'm going to ask all my relatives to get me this game. It's amazing, you control many little animals, they remind me of pokemon but the game is nothing like pokemon. You are a little astronaut who crashlands on a foreign planet and loses all the pieces to his space ship. You lure out the pikmin and make them do your bidding. There are many different kinds of pikmin, blue ones can swim, red ones are flame retardant and the yellow ones go much farther when you throw them. You use these different abilities that the pikmin have to your advantage. You throw them or have them swim to places you cannot reach. They can go across rivers and build bridges for you. When there are big monsters in the way of the pieces of your ship, the pikmin will battle the monster for you. This game will be an amazingly fun one and i would suggest that anyone getting the Gamecube console should look into purchasing this game."
2,Pikmin=Frustrating!,"After looking at a whole bunch of customer reviews, Pikmin sounded like a really fun game, so I got it. However, I was VERY mistaken. At first, Pikmin is a fun and addictive game, but after a while I found there to be no appeal in the game. The game has some VERY serious flaws. First, the days are too short, and until you are very experienced, you can hardly do anything in a day. Second, when you are learning to play, you keep forgetting which button does what and how to move the camera. It can be very frustrating when you release all your Pikmin instead of throwing one. I would like to emphasize the poor camera controls. Also, there is no replayability, as beating the game takes out all the appeal- that is, if you can even like the game well enough to finish it. The game isn't fun at all, and is very frustrating. Customers, I urge you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It is a total waste of money. At least rent the game before you buy it."
2,"I mean, come on. You can do better than that.","Nintendo did a horrible job on this game. I don't mean that the graphics are bad or anything. I mean the fact that this game is timed! I mean, I am the kind of kid that likes to look around and explore, and you can't do that when every second = an hour and there are only 24 hours! What the heck! I also hate this game because the Pikmin are so incredibly dumb! There is no dynamics to how each part is carried back to the ship. Even if there is a Giant Crabdog blocking their path, they insist on taking the route closest to that, which is hugging right up against the crabdog and resuming course when they have gotten past the Crabdog. AKA waking up the Crabdog, which is deadly to your Pikmin because Giant Crabdogs are both deadly and impossible to kill."
1,Pikmin has several elements that make it annoying to play,"The concept of the game was interesting at first, but it soon became incredibly annoying to play. Camera angles are terrible, you have to watch the same cut scene every night, and the short length of the days are more annoying than they are challenging. The implementation should have been much better than it was. The only good thing about this game is the graphics."
3,"great game, but short","I liked the idea of the game, it was very unique and cute. I liked how the pikmin mauled through certain creatures and how they worked. The music was cool, and it was pretty easy to get all of the items.The downside is that you could beat the game in about 2 days. when i played it and it ended, i was left empty, really unsatisfied. But this is one of those games that you play over and over again. Its cool, and for $20, thats not bad at all.be warned that if you like long games, this is not for you.overall grade: B/B-"
4,Pretty Good......,"this is a good game. the graphics are good and so is the sound, and its really fun..... at first. i got bored after a few hours..... and the game doesnt last to long, but i'd buy it anyway since its such an original and fun game! in it u have these plant things called pikmin, and u have to use them to get your space ship parts back. this game is pretty difficult, mostly because their is time in the game, u only have 15 mins for 1 day!!!! but i recommend this for anyone wit a GC."
5,Playing With Your Vegetables,"This is an incredible game dealing with alien life on another planet. The graphics couldn't be better and the game couldn't be more fun. How can you not have fun when you're bossing around things that are half your size? You can throw them around, make them pick things up for you, and even have them pick you up! The game never gets boring because each color Pikmin is different. Some go into water, some go into fire, etc. The most fun part of the game is everyday, when you find a part of your broken-down spaceship, you become so happy. Who knew that your dinner could help save your life on an alien planet? I leave you with one parting thought: IT'S OK TO PLAY WITH YOUR FOOD!"
4,"A very fun, yet chalenging game","I read about this game in magizines and thought it sounded unique, so I went out and bought it. It was definitly worth my money. It is however very, very hard at some points and people should keep that in mind. But overall, this is a great game and will most likely become another Nintendo Classic that will live on for many future generations."
3,Hard,I find this game hard and a little frustrating. You have a time limit of 30 days each day is fifteen min to find 30 peices of your broken space ship in five levels with the help of pikmin.
2,Not so great.,"Why everyone thinks this game is so much fun, I can't understand. Thats just the thing; the game isn't very fun. There is nothing very entertaining about walking around, finding ship parts, and bringing them back. A game needs challenges, which Pikmin doesn't have. Sure, there are monsters to kill, but all you do is lead your Pikmin to them and hope they come out on top. And the monsters are too silly-looking to be taken seriously. It can be fun to an extent, though. Commanding vast hoards of Pikmin do give you a certain type of pleasure. They do your bidding, and you relax. For example, you have one set carry back a ship part, another set carry a flower, have another set work on knocking down a wall, while you and another set scout ahead.But the game just isn't entertaining or engaging. I was never eager to go back for more, whereas in other games I can't stay away. I'm glad I just rented it."
3,not seen before,pros. nice grephics. each Pikmin race has its own ability. the worlds are huge. the gameplay is very originalcons. the bosses are to easy to defeat. only three types of pikmins. the sunmeter is very enoying. the cameras are a real pain in the ass. olimar looks goofy
1,A Little Too Tough......,"For the gamer that loves a challenge, this is for you!!!I am an adventure type game lover and like most any game with a good plot (purrty graphics don't amuse me much) but Pikmin didn't catch my eye. The only reason I rented it was because everyone I know said it looked awesome. I decided to try it myself. The first part of it was alright. Getting the first part of your broken-down ship. Once you get into the next level, it just went downhill.We have the time problem wich goes way to fast. Since you have 30 days to reassemble your ""Dolphin"" (the spacecraft's name) and there are 30 parts of your ship missing. It takes me 2 days to actually find 1 piece for me.Then there are the enemies. Say there are 5 Pikmin in the front of the bad guy. One swipe or chomp...BAM!!! You have 5 less Pikmin. If they had life, it would be a little more interesting.This is my opinion. Other people may like it. I personaly find it too dang hard!I like challenge but not this much."
1,boring,"This game looked interesting at first.....before I saw behind the cover. The only slightly interesting part is the beginning, When you round up your squad. Then it gets boring. Controling the Pikmin is a never-ending job and seems to go on and on. I could of beat the game in a day if there wasn't so much talking and stops. Over all the fighting gets repetitive and wears you out."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G,"I got this game because i thought it looked fun, with the whole concept and stuff. I started playing and i got to the 2nd level. Once I got to the 3rd level it became impossible - it was pointless! Enemies atacking from ever where and the instruction booklet tells you almost nothing :(So... this game is boring, pointless, overly hard, stupid and a down right rip-off and I've had it for a year and I still cant understand why they put this game on the market!!!!"
1,not even a quarter as good as the Zelda Games!!!!!,This Game is boring The graphics are nothing special and the enimies look like blobs and kill off all those stupid Pikmin things you spent a long time getting..When you play games you want the main character to be cool looking but that stupid space guy looks awful and has a Huge head ... when i heard it was from the same guy who made the Zelda games i rented it fast just to be dissaponted to see this game is awful DONT WASTE MONEY ON THIS ...The Zelda games were so much better then this awful peice of Junk... You dont even have enough time to do anything in the short days.. Awful Game Dont Buy Or RENT IT!!
1,NO!,... I rented this game because of other reviews but the graphics aren't that great. The graphics are like Super Mario 64. The buttons are so darn confusing. Once I tried to seperate my pikmin in colours and they all ran away. The Game is to short it's a game that most people would beat in one day. The story line is Your rocket gets hit by an asteroid and you land on a weird planet. Your oxygen supplie will only last you 30 pikmin days. You lost thirty parts of your ship that spread out all over the pikmin world. One pikmin day is like 15 minutes so that means you only get 450 minutes of gameplay! One other thing If you use all 30 days and you've only found 29 or less parts you die and have to start a new game. You don't even fight you don't controll the pikmin. You just stand there while they kill the bad guy ( boring ). If you don't believe me still don't buy the game just rent it you'll see.
4,Wow.,"I went to the CubeClub in SF, where we could play all the launch & post-launch titles for GCN, and of course the biggest crowds were around the well established Smash Bros. and Luigi's Mansion kisoks. While both are great games in their own right, when my cousin and i walked up to the Pikmin game, we were immediately amazed. It looks like a stupid kid game, but Pikmin is and has been the special project of the creator of ""Zelda-Ocarina of Time"" and ""Mario 64"", so we know what to expect. The small part that i played is a very in-depth and strategic game. The only problem i have is that media gurus have said it is very short. But this is definately going on my wish list."
5,Very cool,"I just got his game, but I can conlude that it is a very nice game. This is fun because: You get the little pikmen with items brought to your item. (which is fun to watch the pikmen bring the item they have to carry it to the onion) The boss fights are real cool to watch, as your pikmen get killed. The pikmen are very loyal. They will carry any item, get thrown, and more. They will even line up by color. This is my second favorite game for gamecube. Only Super Smash Bros. is beter. I think SSB. is better, because of all the fun, and features in it. Pikmen, though, is probably for younger kids. 13 or under, since it is sort of a non violent game."
5,cute game,I've really enjoyed this game. My 10 yr old is CRAZY about it. It has a cute story line and the premise is about working together. My 7 yr old has a hard time figuring out how to do certain tasks. otherwise it's a Great Game!
4,Pretty Darn Good,"Very innovative concept. Simple, easy to learn gameplay. So cute you want to cry every time one of your little guys die. However, the game is far too short. Anybody that really gets into games will finish this one in a weekend or less of solid playing. All they needed to add was 4 or so more areas and change up the strategies needed to tackle each level and this one would have been p-e-r-f-e-c-t. The games brevity practically begs for a Pikmin II. Hopefully when that one comes out they will make it a little more complex and lengthy."
5,Pikmin,This is a really cool game with awesome games. You should definitely buy this game and I would say it is the bestgame I have ever played. 5/5
4,Pikmin,"This game looks amazingly easy when you start. I thought that, too. Then, when I was really calm, a giant bird head came out of the ground. It ate almost all of my pikmin. Once you get in to this game, the conrtoller is glued to your hands."
4,"Beautiful, addictive, but very short game","The creator of Mario has done it again with a game that is sure to sell plenty of Gamecubes over the next few months. This game is beautiful and very technically impressive, but at the same time leaves you begging for more.You are marooned on a planet and need to find 30 different parts for your space ship, but with only a limited time to do so. You have 30 ""days"" in the game that are really 15 minute segments in real-time. You use small, mindless creatures called ""Pikmin"" that each have seperate qualities and abilities, who aid you in your quest.The best part of this game is the difficulty. The game is never too hard or really stumps you, but it also never gets too easy or repetitive. It has the perfect mix of strategy and action, all doused in gorgeous graphics and control.Overall, I would suggest this game for anyone who has a good 7 hours to blow with their shiny new Gamecube. Who wouldn't trust the creator of Mario?"
4,Fun for my 9 year old,I bought this for Christmas for my son. He had it for the wii and wanted this version. It is very similar to the wii version except the graphics aren't as good. Overall he enjoys this game.
1,Childish,This game is stupid and childish If your like Michael Heim Grow up nintendo is for babys and mommas boys get the PS2 or Xbox Those have better games.P.S dont you notice how 99.9% of all the games for the GCN are rated E and only one good game is rated M get the picture boys grow up.
5,Fun and Addicting,"This game is great it is fun,addicting,and requires concentration and orginization. I like this game more than most the others. It cool BUY IT! you won't regret it."
3,"I was ""Pik""ed!","For this item, I'm a little disappointed. I ordered the Pikmin 2 game, but was sent the Pikmin game. When I went back to the Amazon site, the page was gone. Since we were on vacation at the time, didn't even notice that it was confirmed incorrectly. Because Amazon is sometimes ""Amazonian"" to approach, trying to rectify it was useless. As for the game, my children play it and think it's pretty good, though they really wanted the Pikmin 2 game. Oh well!"
1,I hated this game,"I cant believe how stupid this game was...Its ridiculous. I am so relieved to have only rented it, and at that, I felt stupid and ripped off...Just not my cup of Java!"
1,This game sux,I have played this game because my friend got it and it is bad. You do nothing but walk around and all these plants follow you around doing nothig. Dont get it! I would recomend supper monkey ball it is cool.
2,Fun AND Addictive,"I own Pikmin and I just can't stop playing it. It is the one of the best games ever mad. The play conrol is easy but intuitive, the graphics are stunning and detailed and the plot, gameplay and lastibility are awesome. Any one who thinks they are to mature for this game, aren't mature enough to play it. Don't under estimate this titlt by its looks because just about anyone can get into it. Please do not listen to the people that criticize this game because they obviously have not played greatness. Try it out and if you are any type of gamer, I'm sure you'll love it."
4,not the most action packed,people think pikmin is dumb because you walk around in circles alot its not that kind of game if you want a action packed game then you probley may not like this game it is really a stragiey game there is still somewhat action in it there is fighting but you only have thirty days on the game befor that little guys helmet runs out of his planets air and the point of the is to find all the picies of the little guys space ship you may lose alot a pikmin in battles but pikmin do everthing for you so in the game you are the bose of them you tell them what they can do you tell them when to carry things fight things and blow up thing this a diffrent game but it is fun i sugeste you rent it if you are not sure about it or just buy it
3,"Goofy, yet addictive","I originally gound the premise of this game really stupid. As soon as i started playing it though it was kind of fun.Its not the kind of game you would play non-stop for hours every day like GTA3, but its not the kind in which you put it in the drawer and only take it out if you want to sell it on ebay.The subject matter is appropriate for small children, but the somewhat complex gameplay is appropriate for a much older audience. Overall its a good game to play if you are a strategy game fan but not if you get frustrated easily."
1,"Buy it, if you like getting ripped off!",it's another deceptively packaged ripoff from the cheats at Studio 99. Save your money and buy real Garth.
4,Good sound quality for live,It's good to hear Bauhaus live after all these years. The best songs are played live with a great sound quality. The only thing I don't like is that they also recorded the break; in other words no music for 3 minutes twice...odd I think.
3,good,"but not that good.the video one stop working after few months, but the sound ones still going strong.no hissing that I can notice.Since they were cheap, I just separated the cables, threw the video to the garbage and replace it."
5,cables,its good and works really good. I will recommend this to anyone that needs one. its an easy hook up
1,Junk Connectors,"When I went to plug thes cables into my TV the end snaped off. Inside the ""metalic"" looking conntector its plastic. These cables are garbage and should not be sold. Beware, new buyers! This stuff is Junk and not worth the Cheap price."
4,Its 25 ft.,"i should have gotten 50 ft. measured once though.... my bad.. excellent wires, no problems had for a month now..."
3,Worked as needed.,No need to get crazy in description. It's just a cable wire that did it's job and NOT the solutoion to this Country's ignorance&problems.
5,Good buy,The cables are exactly what I thought they would be. They are extremely durable and well worth the price.
4,Quality Cable,"This cable met all expectations for a ""value"" product. Nothing fancy, no claims of superior performance - it just does its job as all cables should and the price was right. I have never been able to justify spending great sums on cables with dubious claims of providing a superior picture."
2,Worked Fine Till I Disconnected First Time,"Worked fine till I disconnected for the first time. I went to move cables after I had initially connected them. When I pulled out the video cable, the metal cap on center lead came off. I made the repair, soldering on a new RCA plug and now works fine again."
5,Exactly as expected,These cables worked well and did exactly what I wanted them for. No problems with them and they are sturdy.
4,cables to go,CABLES RECEIVED PROMPTLY AND WERE IN GOOD ORDER. SATISFIED WITH THE PRICE AND WOULD ORDER FROM THIS FIRM AGAINWILLIAM BRYDEN
5,Long Cables Save the Day!,"I needed a really long cable to transfer TV recordings to my computer, and this did the trick!"
3,It works ... however,"I suspect that this long cable is not properly shielded. While it works OK (sending video and audio from my computer to my television across the room), it produces a 60 cycle hum on the audio. Placing the computer closer to the television and using a shorter cable does not produce the hum. In my case, I have a ""work-around"". I use external speakers on the computer rather than sending the audio to the TV."
5,Great series of books for little fingers,"After many failed attempts to get my first son to sit with me and read/look at a book, we tried these books and never looked back. He's now 4 and LOVES books, and my 17 month old is now reading the Little Movers."
3,"Blah story, great sliders","My twin girls are well on their way to wearing out the author's other mini-mover book (Munch, Munch) so I thought they would like this one as well. While they do love to slide out the animal heads, the story is lacking. I would return the book, but for a $3.50 price, shipping it back is not worth it."
5,Adorable books,Lets just say these were a hit at our house. Between my two children we have had to buy 3 copies of this book because it has gotten so much use. They are durable...but with that kind of use we needed more.
2,"Neither a review book, nor a reference book.","I didn't like this book. It was too big to read during the paediatrics course, but the index didn't contain even the most important topics, so it was impossible to use as a reference book.I kept searching whole chapters to find the spesific subjects I was looking for. In the end I handed it back to the store and bought another book.If you want to read Nelson's paediatrics, buy the original, big book, not this one."
1,Arrived shattered,"The bulbs are astonishingly packed together in a plastic pouch inside the product's box; there's no padding as the bulbs clink against each other. Seven of my bulbs arrived broken. A simple impact, despite Amazon's effort to provide some padding, will destroy these bulbs.The cost of the product isn't worth my time to return, provided I'm able to use a couple of the bulbs. Consider ordering from another company that takes greater care with its packaging. Very disappointed."
4,Still sizzling hot -- not cold yet!,"One would think by the tenth novel in a series, the author would be struggling for ideas. That's the advantage of an anthology; the more authors you have, the better the chance that the ideas remain fresh and new. Hot Blood X doesn't let down, though there are a couple of stories that strain to fit into the Hot Blood mold in terms of eroticism. As the series editors wrote in a previous Hot Blood novel, keeping that balance between eroticism and out-and-out porn is difficult. It becomes even more difficult when you're adding horror to the mix. However, most of the stories in Hot Blood X stand true to the balance being achieved and beyond. This tenth novel to the anthology didn't disappoint me. I was repulsed, aroused, shocked, excited and even scared. :) Worth a read, I promise!"
2,Almost a let-down from the previous hot blood books,"Although I am a great fan of the entire hot blood series, I was rather disappointed at reading their latest addition. For the most part the writers seemed to be trying to desperatly stretch their imaginations to come up with something new. It failed, in my opinion. Although the book had one great redeeming value. The last story in the book had a chilling electrifying quality, especially for all those ""curious"" web surfers...overall, I would have expected more from the editors, but a select few stories saved a bit of face. Worth it only if you're a die hard erotic horror fan."
3,ear bud,"I haven't used this product much. It was a little hard at first to insert the connection end to the phone. The sound was not very clear. The product serves its purpose, allowing to you be hand free."
2,Broke after a short time,This worked really great until after only a very short time the part that plugs into the phone broke. It would not get a good connection so you would have to hold it in tight defeating the purpose of the handsfree.
3,Nothing special,"For the Dashwood sisters everything seems to be going wrong. Their father dies and they become utterly poverty stricken.The book was ok except the charcters could get pretty annoying especially whats her name the middle child, who really annoyed me. In a lot of teen books the main characters do such stupid things that I could never imagine doing and I wonder if the author thinks that teens are stupid or if they're trying to teach me a lesson.Anyway, this book was an ok read, something to sustain me with some thing to read while waiting for some thing better to come along.I don't highly recommend it but it is readable."
2,Far from anything in the least bit special.,"The characters are trite. Boring. You've seen them a hundred times over. Every single one. The same goes for the plot, which revolves around these teenage girls' predictable love lives. The writing is weak. While it's capable of keeping you interested, I still consider it a waste of time. It's fine for someone who's never read a decent book before, but otherwise, leave it."
1,A Waste of Paper,"This just might have been the most fluffy, boring, utterly useless book I've ever read. It's what I would classify as a ""Typical Teen Novel"", meaning its plot has been recycled over and over and over again. The characters were cute, but you've seen them all before; the plot was boring and horribly predictable, and made up 100% of fluff. From the way she writes, this author makes it seem as though she's never even BEEN to England, let alone lived there. I honestly don't know how this book ended up getting published. It made me sad for my generation. Don't waste your time on this book."
4,good buy,"my 21 mo old loves this toy, agree that the base/holder is useless, did not find anything sharp like another reviewer did, utensils seem great I would use them myself in the kitchen"
3,Unfinished Miss Nobody,"An engaging story about a girl (""Nameless Nobody"") and her personal miseries as a tortured and lonely outsider, first in poverty, later amidst material riches. This interrupted early Dostoevsky novel has all the usual Dostoevskyan themes, but one less typical subject is Netochka's sexual awakening and scenes of secret fun with another girl. Overall an enjoyable read for any aficionado of D's writing."
3,Clearly not Dostoyevsky's finest.,"If you are checking out Dostoyevsky for the first time, do not read Netochka Nezvanova. However, for avid Dostoyevskians, Netochka Nezvanova will let you see how he wrote during his early years, and how well his writing evolved since then. The book is somewhat hard to relate to, and not very interesting. It becomes longish and no other point really develops throughout the book that you couldn't catch on the first page. It is a short read, however- you might as well give it a try."
3,"Americans, americans...","My dear american friends.Some things are simply contradictory in essence. For example, 'Dostoevskii fans' mentioned here somewhere. As for the book, I would (humbly) advise to read it with your heart and soul (this is how it was written, after all).Netochka's mother 'killed herself'? Read again. Some reader here mentioned 'soap opera' in the last part of 'Netochka'. The problem is that one should understand more about the russian culture to judge this. But I guess that these details may confuse some people. No, it is quite far from being a soap opera. To understand more about this part, try to read some of Chekhov short stories (to understand at least what is being fought against).When I read Fedor Mihailovich Dostoevskii books (The Idiot and Netochka especially), I feel and see differently. Quite much after 150 years."
4,Clubman Pinaud After Shave,Love it and will never use another after shave as long as i live-Go Pinaud!Do you have a colonge I could try
5,My favorite after shave,"This stuff says Barber Shop, capital B - capital S. , right down to the rotating barber's pole outside. You're gonna smell like you just had a shave & a haircut from the man with the leather strop and straight razor. Will never be mistaken for some gender confused metro-sexual fragrance. Recently barbered men in North America and a goodly portion of Europe have smelled of this for around a century - the population has continued to rise during that whole time."
4,Old School & Clean Smell For Great Price,This is an old brand and that should tell you something. Nothing last a long time in the marketplace if it's not good.Good for a young man on date night or dad just trying to smell nice for mom. Not one of those after shaves that has you checking to label to see if you picked up something for a girl. For real men only.
5,Wanted some old time smelling aftershave.,This is the exact smell of the stuff old time barbers use to splash their customers withback in the age just after the cavemen were around. I remember those times and remember the fragranceso I got me some. Works just perfectly by not being too overpowering AND it has that sting when it hitsthe new shaved areas just like in the good old days. Try some--you'll like it!
2,"Does the job, its just the smell...","I was super pumped to buy this product because I felt like splashing on some Clubman Pinaud would be a great way to start the day, and you just feel awesome using it. HOWEVER, yes it does do the job, BUT it is definitely a very oldman/barber-shop smell. Some may like it, and I say :go for it. I personally do not like the smell, it starts off with a very alcohol type of smell, which did die down, but it still just doesn't smell appealing to me, or my girlfriend. I just ordered some ck aftershave so we will see how that goes."
4,A well thought out machine with power to spare,"We received our Eureka 4880BT and couldn't wait to try it out. After doing the living room and bedroom carpets, the amount of dog hair this machine sucked up, from what we thought were clean carpets, was nothing short of amazing. But even more, the fine dust and dirt particals this vacuum cleans up is fantastic.If I were to have one complaint about the vacuum, it would have to be the switch for selecting either carpet or hard surfaces. It's kind of cheap in quality compared to the rest of the vacuum, as is the foot switch which unlocks the handle from the locked upright position.My reccomendation is, if you're waivering between a bagless vacuum and one that needs bags, spend the extra dollars to go bagless. This machine sucks up such huge amounts, that going bagless will pay for its self in no time at all.This is my first Eureka, being a former Hoover consumer, but all I can say is ""Eureka"" we made the right choice!"
3,Here's why America is losing ground in the mfg. arena !,"Just picked one of the 4885B models up today to replace an old Victory Powerline model that's had enough. Paid $95 to a fellow here in Portland via Craigslist. He demo-ed it, it worked fine and he explained how he vaccums the pre-motor filter clean...well, the both filters (HEPA as well) looked to be fairly filthy and when I got it home I set about to looking to replace them....now to find out that, as mentioned elsewhere here. YOU CAN'T !!What I intend to do at this point...perhaps others may try. That will be to soak the pre-motor filter in bleach and see where that gets us. I'll get a new HEPA as well....but, wow...what a disappointment ! Kicking myself here for not doing more homework before going to get it from him. This is clearly why he let loose of it !!!"
4,Good starter book for the basics,"This is an excellent basic acoustic guitar book for the rather inexperienced player who wishes to know the classic songs that ""everyone knows"". The music within is perfectly accurate as far as I can tell by playing with the music. I found Claptons ""Change the World"" and James Taylor ""Fire and Rain"" particularly fun to play. The level of difficulty inspires confidence and encourages progress."
5,Very Good,This product was sent in a timely manner. The packaging ensured that the product was not damaged. I was happy to get it since my car CD player ate my original copy.
5,Darkly honest in its sensitive subject matter,"I finished this book in two days and was not angered by the use of private journals; the author exposes readers to hard-to-bear truths that we are afraid to comfront. Harvard has its problem areas. And it is good to be made aware of that. I think the two young women were described fairly and not ""used"" as some readers have suggested. If this was such a ""tabloid"" and ""uncompassionate"" book as people proclaim, why did they even bother to finish it in the first place? We are so high on our morals that we forget to comprehend that the book was written to help us understand rather than make us think differently or negatively of the victim and murderer. A perceptive and enlightening book."
2,Disappointing,"The big surprise in this book, unfortunately, is that it is not well written. I have not read any of the author's other work, but given her credentials, I assumed that she is an accomplished writer. Halfway Heaven gives the impression that it was a rush-job, with the author trying to get it into the stores as quickly as possible while the memory of this terrible event was still fresh in the public's mind. Sure, she went to Ethiopia and did some other research, but the various threads of the story are not well integrated; it seems like more of a verbal scrapbook surrounding the main event. I also agree with the other reviews that describe it as exploitative and voyeuristic, but enough has already been written about all that. Skip this one. I gave it 2 stars only because it is compelling in a few places."
2,thought it is very sensational,which is ok if that is what you are looking for. I did feel disgusted to be reading the private journal of a mentally ill person. Seems insensitive. I think that I'd have preferred if Ms. Thernstrom did not invade her privacy like that.
2,The story was not brought together,"I did not attend Harvard and so, to those who feel only Harvard alums dislike it, you are incorrect.I felt that the story was disjointed,and had no synthesis. I also agree with those who thought the author exploited the girls. I would add that to my mind, you have to be very careful that you are not exploiting people or trying to profit from tragedy when you write about crime. The only reason to do it is to honestly shed insight into the larger meaning of a tragedy. Thernstrom failed to achieve this synthesis."
4,Engrossing,"I was rather puzzled as to why quite a number of readers have expressed their disapprobation for this novel, because personally, I thought it was brilliant. True, the structure did falter at times and I found the psychology bits a tad unwieldy. But the pace was suspenseful, and I was thoroughly shaken by Thernstrom's investigation into evil and the human consciousness.If you still have a gilded picture of Harvard after reading this book, I would be quite surprised. And the best part is, it avoids degenerating into salacious prose."
4,"Flawed, but frighteningly accurate","I attended Harvard, and was in the class of '96. I did not know Sinedu or Trang, so I cannot speak for the accuracy (or lack) in Ms Thernstrom's depiction of them. However, she is dead-on in her description of Harvard's attitude towards mental health problems and treatment. I disagree with the comments implying she had an axe to grind with Harvard; she states in the book that her own experience had been much more positive, and she said very few things I considered to be unfair or vindictive. I didn't agree with everything she says in the book, and I agree that she includes some details which are extraneous, but on the whole I was extremely surprised at the book's quality. I read it only recently, and very reluctantly, expecting it to be as exploitative as most other ""true crime"" books, but it is not. I will recommend this book to others, not least because of the accuracy of her description of Harvard."
5,"Haunting, revealing account",I worked at Harvard for many years and knew a number of the people Thernstrom interviewed. Her take on the institution is stunningly accurate. The book is extremely well conceived and executed. The insight that this book offers into Sinedu's incredible loneliness (not even this word properly describes her life experience) is haunting. The chapter describing the author's visit to Ethiopia and the culture differences she discovers between Ethiopian life and American life is stunning. Read it!
3,"Gripping, but...","A gripping tale of the widely reported murder-suicide, mostly thanks to the killer's diary and interviews with the victim's family. But it is the same thing that makes me ill: Thernstrom talks about how much the whole thing troubles her, including an incident she had with the killer while teaching a course at Harvard. But she apparently isn't troubled by using the diaries and the victim's family to make a lot of money. Maybe this is true of all true crime books, but Thernstrom seems to have taken such crassness one step beyond - marketing the most personal sufferings and her own hand-wringing."
3,"Great Collection, Substandard Transfer","Found this season on sale at the local mega mart and thought it would be a great watch-together for me and my eleven year old boy. Excellent story lines with only a few predictable plots. Fast enough pace to keep me and my young-un interested. Thin storage cases that hold two DVD's each - nice. I was afraid these were going to be double-sided DVD's - always tough to determine which episodes you're loading, but not to worry. Only real complaint is the video transfer. Looks like the source material was VHS tape rather than film stock. Acceptable on a portable DVD player, but annoying when seen on a big screen TV. Would have been 5 stars otherwise."
1,Extremely disapointing DVD quality,"After seeing the very nicely done 1st and 2nd season releases of MacGyver I am very upset about the picture quality of the 3rd season.Paramount, I was looking forward to having the complete collection of MacGyver, but I will not buy any more seasons if you do not release the show in good picture quality. It is the worse quality I have ever seen on DVD."
5,Macqyver DVD's,Great season. My kids love him and he teaches a lot of things on his shows. And he doesn't like to shoot people! No problems with shipping. Great service!
5,I turned my lighter into a jet pack!,"If you are not a MacGyver or cheesy 80's tv show fan, then move along to something else, if you are a fan of the show these dvd'S are perfect for you! No issues with DVD play at all, the disc are all of high quality and the picture quality is about what one would expect for a show filmed in pre HD days. The show is everything we loved and remembered, after all no one else in the world can turn a pile of seemingly normal items found in a room into an explosive device! The best part is the 80' s were in full effect when the show was taped and it is evident in the show, it's like watching a time capsule in full effect.If you are a MacGyver fan or know one, these box sets are the perfect addition to any collection."
5,Love Some MacGyver,"I haven't opened this yet, but I love MacGyver, always have and always will. I definitely recommend this series to anyone that loves adventure, mixed with a little comedy."
1,Terrible,Never received my item. Sent 2 emails to seller with no response. Billed on my Amazon credit card which I now have to dispute. Very Poor!
2,poor service,I did not receive that product. After a month of waiting I contacted the company and received an e-mail that my order was canceled.
4,does what it needs to do,"This is a simple, well-built solution to attenuate line-level signals.Keep in mind, though, that 6 dB actually isn't that much. The 12 dB equivalent part is probably more appropriate for you attenuation needs. (This is why I gave it four instead of five stars - 6 dB is not a terribly useful value, but there is nothing wrong with the part itself.)"
4,An Honest Bishop,"Peter Carnley is the Archbishop of Perth, Australia. My main interest in this book was the 28-page section on the historical evidence surrounding the resurrection stories. Carnley concludes honestly that the historical evidence is insufficient to justify belief in the resurrection of Christ. To overcome the shortfall, Carnley goes on to suggest an epistemology in which Christians know of the resurrection of Jesus through the witness of the church or the Holy Spirit. Personally, I place no stock in such and conclude that it would be most reasonable not to believe."
4,"Ever heard of ""el no hay, no hay mano""?",This film shows one of the masters of comedy + acting in all of latin america and why he is loved. The development of characters are of no comparison in this mexican/comedy/drama with others of its generation.
2,Very Average,"I Respect Nelson George from way back when, but this Book doesn't really do much for Me one way or the other.as for Russell Simmons I respect the fact He made His Way but overall I don't find Him that Challenging&I can't Respect How He let His Artists kinda just slip without taking care of them Better.Public Enemy,LL COOL J to name a few didn't get the best shake from Him.He gets into His Lifestyle&that's basically it.nothing more nothing less.Very Ordinary read."
4,hip hop history,"i found the book to be a strong read about a person who built a businessandmanaged to keep ot successful and afloat for a long time. i critisize some of his remarks regarding how hip hop violence was not instigated by the music itself. when i read that i remember being at ozzy concerts years ago and he would instigate people to go crazy. there is music that pushed people to explode and go nuts. hip hop is that type of music. like it or not, thats why i like listening to it. an impressive read in a simple format."
5,GREAT BOOK,"If your into the culture, then this is definitely a great read. I say that because you'll notice throughout this book that Russell Simmons' has had a hand in the development of almost every artist that emerged into the mainstream in the mid to late 80's. From Kurtis Blow to the Fresh Prince himself he's gotten paid. After reading this book, I'm convinced that Simmons was born to be who is."
4,Interesting Book,"This book was fun to read, Russell details some of his adventures very well and intorduces us to the world of hip-hop from his point of view. I recommend it if you're at a beach somewhere having a corona or at starbucks and want to just read. If youre looking for business insights, not that many."
5,"Comprehensive, easy to read with a southern hemisphere bias.",The book remains easy to read throughout. Particularly orientated to what the amateur stargazer can see with relatively accessible equipment. The book has a southern hemisphere bias which is particularly welcome to the antipodean observer who is bombarded coninually with information generated in the northern hemisphere: for us it provides examples from familiar surrounds.
1,What a waste of time,Like the man himself this book is of no use. In an attempt to *simplify* the process he has created a manual for how to open one's eyes.As with many of the other books David has written this would best be left in the bargain bin where it was found.He shuld stick to teaching at high school =)
3,"First women to fly for a Major US Airline, tells all.","Bonnie Tiburzi was the first women to pilot for a major US airline - which excludes smaller airlines and foreign carriers. Still a major achievement. She started off, as most pilots did at that time, serving as the flight engineer in a crew of three (most modern planes now have only a crew of two - both pilots) on an American Airlines 727. As the first woman, she endured much ribbing, and not just a few instances of more overt male chauvanism. the book follows her to flight academy, and charts a failed marriage to another pilot and her ultimate furlough. Though making the grade at American was a substantial achievement, the book feels painfully unfinished."
3,Please Don't BUY/WASTE $$$ on costly SAP book.,"SAP readers should avoid wasting money on this pricey book. (Try Using SAP R/3 (Special Edition) by Jonathan Blain instead - it's more value-added!). It's simply not worth it. You are not getting the quality at the cost pegged to it. There are many good jumpstart books in the market that provides good treatment of SAP financials and financial accouting systems (AR/AP/GL/Costings/Financial Report Writing). This is one book that everyone should boycott in the name of knowledge-sharing for the greater society. Join a consultancy/business partner firm, and you are treated to better and updated SAP versions without giving support to profiteering individuals. Publishers like John Wiley should blacklist profiteering professionals/individuals who are out to exploit and profiteer."
2,Misleading title for an overpriced book!,"After reading this book it's completely unclear to me why the author gave this book the subtitle ""Beyond Business Process Reengineering"" ... This book has nothing to do with BPR, it's simply a book that explains with many screenprints some very basic FI AP/AR/GL business processes. Don't expect any discussion of CO business processes.The book has a generic, non-US, flavor. US readers will miss discussion of topics like ""US sales and use taxes"", ""check management in AP"", ""1099 vendors"", ""lockbox processing"", ""cost of sales accounting / functional areas"", etc.All in all, the book is okay for people new to SAP who want to get a feel for how you enter transactions in SAP's FI module and don't mind US-specific processes are not discussed.Finally, the book is very expensive. I believe David Novak's book (Configuring SAP R/3 FI/CO: The Essential Resource for Configuring the Financial and Controlling Modules) is a much better book and much more reasonable priced."
2,Overpriced book,"I wasted money on this book. Currently, I am working on 4.6C and this book is outdated. This book covers very basic GL,AP,AR, functions and I do not refer this book at all. For beginner, this book might be helpful, however, I do not think any SAP consultants do not need this book."
5,Excellent for beginners,This book enables you to understand in a very short time the way SAP R/3 works and reveals the main functional capabilities of the FI-Module. My review of this book can be summarized as follows: Everyone dealing with the FI-Module of SAP R/3 should read at first this book.
4,Worth the purchase,"My 23 month old son and I have great learning fun together. He thouroughly enjoys it and I'm happy to let him play it since he is learning his ABC's, 123's, shapes and colors at the same time. Thank you for a great product!"
3,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings about this. We got it because it was supposed to be usable on our Mac, but its only if you have Classic 9 installed (we don't).We had a previous version (JumpStart Reading and JumpStart Math) that we did use on our Windows 95 machine years ago, and our child then loved it. We had high hopes for our youngest, but it was disappointing regarding the platform compatibility.If you have a PC, as I recall, it was a wonderful product for young kids."
3,Engrossing but I am not sure she is learning anything.,"My 3 year old daughter will sit for hours playing with this software. I do not, however, see or hear the results of their accomplishments together. The language cd offers 3 other languages but I have yet to hear her say a word in any other language. She has already mastered the alphabet which is good because this really does not teach the alphabet just arbitrarily some letters throughout the game. I do not really think it is worth the $29.99. I gave it 3 stars because she seems to like to play with it and 1)it is better than tv and 2) I am sure she is learning something."
5,Babies Have it Made,"I think this video was incredible. There is great writing and is great for an older child who has a new baby coming into their home. I think that if you are looking for something for a child in this situation, this video would be a great tip. Horace will win the love of you and your child's heart. I believe that this could influence your child in so many positive way. It is the sausage of life."
4,No Title,"NFSU does capture the idea of 'building and racing cars' but I think they could go a little further into the design of your so-called 'pimp-mobile'. The only interior you get to design is the trunk, I think they could at least do the seats, or the wheel. Outside design is A-OK. Anything from sideskirts to multi-colored vinyels you make your car fierce.The plot-line in single player mode really dosen't go that deep, your just some guy who wants to get his title back.In multi-player you race your own cars in tracks you already won, but the down-side is the whole graphics in two player is horrible.It is a game worth getting, but you might sell it later on."
1,Not very smart.... hehe!,"Some fool says that if you get another racing game then your not very smart... well ""smart one"" (lmao rofl lol!!!) Midnight club ii, gran turismo 4, And other racing games will be way better ten this. probably even burnout 3 even if it gets boring."
3,Need 4 Speed Underground II,"this game is pretty decent. I had alot more fun with the original Need 4 Speed Underground game, although this game does feature a virtual Brooke Burke and a track on the soundtrack that features The Doors and Snoop Dogg. this is a good racing game if you're into import racing. features upgradeable engines, body kits and much more..."
3,Very destructive!,"This game is fun- you get to pick a race car and run amok among cities. You can even go the wrong way. For me (older adult) it was fun to play with my kids, but I found it repetitive and boring after a while. Of course my kids love the gamecube and really like this game."
5,Question for the experts-,"Is this game for a 6 year old. It's rated ""E"", but does it have ANY bad language or improper themes for a 6 yr. old? I saw that some of the songs are Hip Hop songs- are they edited versions? Also, will he be able to get the hang of it or is it too difficult? Thanks"
1,The most detail game on the market,This game is awsome. You feel like you are really there. But it seems a little over priced.
4,its definatly a fun game,"but theres just no sense of speed in this game thats pretty much its only con so what am i complaining about this game is a really good street roaming game you search for a shop or a race. you can choose races like street X drag drift sprint normal and the underground racing league.tricking out your car is the funnest your cars look so sweet, and theres so many different ways to customize your ride. overall it doesnt have the best graphics but the music and sounds are great. a great racing game."
4,hope it is better,"the first nfs was great but it didnt have the aspect of free roam. i wanna be able to do what i want and race anywhere, anytime, and i hope this game has that. i love the concept of popularity and adding on many various parts(i think gran turismo has the title of most and best cars and upgrades.) the game SRS offers a lot but i like nfs games so much i would choose this. if u like fame, money, cars, and upgradable things, you will love any underground games.P.S.:nfs hot pursuit 2 is not like this and is not worth the buy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Good value - but if purchasing for a wheelchair....,"This item was purchased to add back support to my mother's wheel chair. It is well made and a good value, but beware: even with the straps, it tends to slip down and out of the sling-back style wheel chair. It is now used as support in a recliner chair."
4,This book is not for everyone...,"While this book is not for everyone, I would recommend it for researchers who want more objective information on the British BSE situation. It was written before a confirmed case of the disease was found in the U.S., but still provides valuable background on the European development of the issue. The two chapters providing a content analysis of both the British and American media's framing of the disease were particularly helpful."
1,I wasted my money,"Many of the references were incorrect. Especially, the chapters on the scientific perspectives of BSE."
1,Save Your Money,"If you want to buy a book about mad cow diseases, check out Deadly Feasts or Mad Cow USA. This book edited by Ratzan is a disappointing hodge podge, disjointed and not interesting."
4,where the heck were the copper washers???,"great hoses! i went to use & no stinking new washers??? the old ones don't like to be squeezed twice!!!other than that, a trip into town & a $1.00 a piece for the washers (needed 4) @ the lovely~let me bend you over NAPA representitive was glad to assist me! hoses are good to go though!"
3,"Great book, bad shape.","The book is just great, the problem was the shape of it. It had ""notes"" on pen all over it. It's a shame."
5,Charming Charley,"This is a great coffee table book. The charming illustrations are captioned by Charley Harper, illustrating his wit as well as his graphic talents. His images are an inspiration to artists of all types."
3,Only OK...,"I purchased this book, largely based upon the reviews on Amazon and the the fact that it was the only book on Charley Harper on the market at the time.While I L O V E Charley Harper's work, I don't think this book does him justice. There is little to no design to the book and a very limited selection of Charley's work.Spend a few dollars more and get Todd Oldham's Illustrated Life book...I just received mine and it is beautiful. I don't think it has all of Charley's work, but it must have most of it. There's a great interview of Charley by Todd Oldham, as well."
5,Beguiled By The Wild,"This is one of the best books by a great 20th century artist, illustrator and educator. The art is there in all its beauty and simplicity. Charlie Harper was never one to go out of the way to self promote or market his name or art. He was the real package, a nice person, first, and then one of the most creative artist of the 20th century.Charlie never copied anyone and came years before the creation of the ""graphic designer"". He was an illustrator in the era of commercial artists not graphic designers. He proceeded the ""clean"" look of graphics that existed in the 1970s and 80s. In that respect he helped young illustrators and designers look for a way to simplify their approach to solving creative problems. The success of any visual artist is in the work and not the words. Take an opportunity to introduce yourself to this under exposed artist. I'm sure you'll enjoy the visual trip and get a chuckle out of his humorous comments."
5,faberge style moonstone pendant egg pendant.,It is a beautiful piece of jewelry. My parents gave me money to buy a birthday gift for myself. I chose this and couldn't have done better.
5,S CLub 7 is AWESOME!!!!!!!!,"S CLub 7 is AWESOME!!!!!!!! They are the best band I have ever heard and all of my friends like them and I have all of their songs on a conveinient mp3. If you buy this album you will not regret it. Their albums have plenty of songs that you just want to get up and dance to but there are some that are a bit more mellow. In short, BUY THEIR ALBUMS AND PUT THEM ON AN MP3!!!!!!!C; C; C; C; C; [...]"
5,S Club's Seeing is believing,"This movie was corny but fun for any S Club fan. The music is always top notch. Good tracks too. Especially ""Hey Kitty"" and ""Love Ain't Gunna Wait For You""."
5,awesome cd,The best s club album so far. The best cd i have ever heard. I would recomend this cd to anyone. The songs were very well written and sang. Great job s club.
5,5 STARS. DEFINITELY 5 STARS!!!!,"W O W lol I'm a HUGE S CLUB fan and i definitely think that THIS is their best album ever.Well it's really really really sad and heartbreaking that the world's best pop group split up... but the S Club fever hasn't died down and that's why you should buy this album. The songs in this album are absolutely fantastic. Every single one of them are much more maturer than the ones in their previous albums (OF COURSE all of their songs are great, but.. still lol)My favourite tracks in this album are Let Me Sleep (Definitely 5 stars), Alive (very upbeat :)), Whole Lotta Nothing (very maturely upbeat), Love Ain't Gonna Wait For You (the same goes for this lol), Do It Til We Drop (such a happy and bouncy song! I LOVE THIS ONE lol), and Straight From The Heart (a very soft one :) I love it).Others are awesome as well so i suggest you buy this album if you are a fan of pop music :)S Club has split up but their spirit still lives!!!!"
2,"Great at first, then not so wonderful","When I got this to put in the closet, I was very pleased: the light was bright, easy to use and it was easy to stick to the wall.However, the brightness does not last! You have to change the batteries every couple of months, even if using alkalines, to get a bright light. The color of the LEDs is a little off, too.So I could only recommend this as an emergency light or somewhere where you won't use it very often.And under no circumstances forget to turn it out and leave it burning overnight!"
4,The best Sonata VI,"The price dealers are charging for this CD, both in the US and the UK, is, of course, ridiculous. But it's worth keeping your eye open for it. Kim Woo Paik ignores earlier interpretative tradition, and ploughs his own furrow, with results that are sometimes quirky. But there is one performance here that is simply stunning -- that of Sonata VI. No other pianist I have heard captures the dramatic and demonic character of this work to anything like the same extent (indeed Richter, in the most admired recording of this work, totally misses it). This is playing of remarkable intensity and power, riveting from the first note till the last. This is my favourite recording of any of the late Scriabin piano sonatas, after Horovitz's 1960s recording of the Ninth.The producers deserve a rap over the knuckles. When you hear what they tell you is op. 7, you are in fact hearing op. 12, and vice versa. And the cover of the brochure is of rare hideosity."
2,The Photocopier from Hell,"To begin with the good news: it is good that a reprint of this pioneering work on Thomas Jefferson's architectural work is available. At the time of my purchase, there were no copies of the original work to be had at any price. And now for the bad news: the publisher decided to reproduce the numerous photographic illustrations by sending someone to the library with a roll of quarters for the photocopier. Half-tone illustrations are bound to suffer somewhat in a facsimile edition, but these are by far the worst I have seen. I bought this book as a gift, but I hesitate to offer such a shoddy product to anyone."
5,Great CD!,"It's hard to resist Conroy's CD ""You Can't Resist."" This is one of my favorate cds. Conroy captures the flavor of Canadian Country and belts it out with spirit and enthusiasm. My favorate tracks are ""What Else Can I Do"" and ""Can't Resist It."" This is a cd I play over and over and never get tired of."
4,An Excellent Summary of Ideologies,"This is a very good summary on the subject of ideologies for undergraduate students. The book assumes no prior knowledge of the subject. It is easy to read and very comprehensive. It's a pity it has no photographs of at least a few major political leaders and ideologues. I sometimes use this book as an encyclopedia of ideologies to refresh my memory about the basics of the subject, even though I have tought ideology to different kinds of students for some time now."
1,One to avoid,"3 new studio tracks which sound like they are demo out takes from the last album, plus 9 live songs recorded (very badly) in the US in 2001.The live stuff includes 3 boring songs from the last LP and only The Joke and Damo Suzuki are worth listening to.The sound quality is [poor]and so is the sleeve (as we've come to expect)."
3,Great thrash/hardcore crossover hurt by bad production!,"When I first got it back in the day, I really loved this album. Being a fan of both thrash metal and the hardcore scene, it was like I had the best of both. The musicianship is excellent and the lyrics are very intelligent. The production quality really hurt the power of the songs though. Other than that these guys were one of the best Christian metal bands during the early 90's."
5,Metallica,This book is as close to playing like Kirk and James as possible....i would recommend this book to anyone at any level of playablity
5,Lots of fun!,"I haven't gone completely through this tab book to check for errors, but seems to be right, according to my ears. Now I can play Master of Puppets (everything but the solo) on my Epiphone--not fast, of course, as that takes time. I play it probably at 90 beats per minute! lol. Anyways, this tab book is highly recommended!"
5,Rating Master of Puppets Tablature,What can I say? I was thrilled from the moment I opened the package. Service was great and I'll surely shop this way again. Thanks so much!
4,Thoroughly Delectable,"I absolutely loved this novel. I first got into Amanda Quicks books at my public library, skimming the isles for something interesting. Her book Seduction caught my eye and I have never looked back. Desire is a thoroughly enjoyable book to sit down and lose yourself in for a few hours. Unlike many of Amanda's books, this is set in a much earlier era and placed well outside her usual haunts of London. The characters are memorable, funny and witty. Our Hero draws you to him but I'm afriad I can't say the same for the leading Lady. I admire her courage, but on the odd accasion she seems overly bold and quite demanding.Her treatment of Sir Gareth put me off and for a woman so learned and apparently kindly, I fail to see why she should attack his appearance every second page. He can't exactly help his size and she always seems to be putting him down. However they do work well together and in the end, you see just why they are so perfect for each other. All in all a very good read."
2,So-So,"I could not like this book, although I tried. The character's actions did not fit with the era in which the story was to have taken place, so much so that I could not get into the story for the jarring inaccuracies. The plot was slow and repetitive; I was very tired of hearing the exclamations about Saint Hermione, and Clare's virginity. And I was heartily disgusted with all of Clare's ""friends"", none of whom believed her. Predictable as well, I identified the villain, his helper, and the outcome very early on. For all of that, the characters were likeable, and the ""mystery"" toward the end was interesting. A so-so 2 stars at best."
3,"Disappointed in attitudes, but still a good story","I was disappointed in the way the men in this book looked at women. I know that some men looked at women that way during the time period this book was written in, but to have the author come out and say that the father valued is books and work more than his child was almost too much for me. Then when the ""hero"" took the same attitude I was ready to scream. This book did have its good points in that the story was interesting about how they traveled all over to get to her "" long lost relative"" for the sake of a crystal ball, only to discover that they had been thrown in prision. So they end up traveling to his home in England where they finally find peace and the older magician the ""hero"" sets out to find. It really was an enjoyable story once I got past the attitudes of the men."
2,THE CHARACTERS ARE DULL AND UNINVITING.,I WAS DISAPPOINTED FIRST BECAUSE THE BOOK IS VERY SLOW MOVING. ALSO IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CONNECTED TO THE CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEY ARE WRITTEN WITHOUT PASSION OR SPIRIT. THE BOOK WOULD HAVE SERVED BETTER TO HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE JINNI AND ROBIN. THOSE TWO WERE INTERESTIN AND HAVE A CHEMISTRY. THANK YOU.
5,A road trip through the Deep South,"Anthony Walton lets us ride along on his journey back to his Mississippi roots. A story of pain and survival, relayed through the voices of his parents (among others), is skillfully woven with history lessons and Walton's own moving poetry. A very readable and important contribution."
3,"Wonderfully written, but some facts are questionable.","Walton's book, while wonderfully written, has several glaring errors that make one question whether he bothered to keep his facts straight on the events taking place in his book. For instance, in the opening paragraph of the book, the author crosses the bridge from Concordia ""County,"" Louisiana into Natchez, MS. Any self-respecting Southerner knows that Louisiana has parishes, not counties. In addition, he talks of Charles Evers, brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, as longtime mayor of Philadephia, MS. Actually, Evers was mayor of Fayette, MS, which is quite a long way from Philadelphia. I enjoyed the book, but I found myself wondering how much of it was accurate. As a native Missippian, his family story tugs at my heartstrings and leaves me wondering if things will ever change in my home state. I only wish I could trust his story to be true."
3,It's just a lifetime airfilter.,"I just put this filter on my MDX. I have taken three 1,000 mile trips in the last couple months the last one I installed this filter, there was no difference. It will work as a lifetime filter and that is about it."
2,Economy juggling bags,"If these juggling bags hadn't been called ""Economy"" I would be very disappointed, but this is a case of you get what you pay for. I bought them for my son, who has just learned to juggle. He enjoys the look of these bags but the feel or ""hand"" is not very good. They are constructed of a synthetic vinyl-type material and the filling was not very uniform (one bag was packed looser than the other two, which makes it squishier and also lighter- not desirable for any juggler, especially beginners). I wish I had put what I paid for this set into more expensive higher-quality juggling bags. Live and learn."
4,Fantastic set of juggling balls but you could just use tennis balls,I have been using this set for over 2 years. I like to juggle everyday to maintain my hand eye coordination. They are solidly built and a good weight. Not much more to say except that if you want to juggle these are great juggling balls. Of course you could just always use tennis balls.
2,Not durable enough for actual juggling,"This product is not made to last! I got this set for christmas, and by the end of the day the thread was unraveling from the seams. I would not recommend these bags to beginning jugglers or intermediate jugglers like me because this set begins tearing apart after just a few drops."
3,OK,"This book was a required reading assignment for a graduate level MAT course on curriculum. The book raises some interesting points, however, the points are raised over and over again with redundance. The book could be condensed to half its original size. Great cover! I love the monopoly analogy."
1,"The three Bs - Boring, Bad, Boring","I don't have this game, i only played it at a few stores. I beat a couple bosses and got bored of it right after that. I would expect this game to have come out on the NES and it still would have been a bad game. the plot is boring and repetative, and there aren't any twists to the story - suck up a ghost, beat up a boss ghost, suck up more, beat up another boss ghost...Plus, it's a lot like Blinx: The Time Sweeper (Xbox) and that's a way better game."
1,buying this game my have a sideafect of YAWNNNNNNNN,"I MADE THE STUPID MISTAKE of buying this game and sure was i disapointed , the graphics were cool but the gameplay was a piece of crap!!o boy sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner ,so fun, NOT!!!!do not!! i repeat do NOT buy or even rent it .the whole 10 minutes in the beginning is just pro.e gadd goin blah blah blah.nintendo really messed up on this game ,they should be embarresed to put the great video game compenys name on such a horror.i love gamecube but thie first game was a TERROR!!!!!!"
1,Gave my son nightmares,My son loves nintendo and all of the mario/luigi games. We were very excited to give him this new game. I guess the graphics were too real. He couldn't sleep and had nightmares and asked us to take the game and box out of his sight. Not very good for impressionable children. The recommended age is 6 and over. He is 7 and was terrified by the game.
4,Luigi's Mansion: Hours of ghostly fun,"When I purchased Luigi's Mansion, I played it for about two hours on the first day, and then, because it was the weekend, I played it pretty much nonstop. I got very far in the game (up to area 4!) on my first three days (and 7 or so hours) of ownership, and I've experienced enough of the game to know that it will last a very long time without ever becoming dull or boring. Luigi's Mansion has an intriguing plot line, fairly simple gameplay, and a convienient control layout. One thing that concerns me slightly, though, is that in dark areas of the mansion, background music starts playing that could give you a nervous feeling, sort of like you're being watched by some mysterious power. (Or maybe the dark just makes me skittish...) I would recommend this game to anyone 7 and up."
5,Love this game as a family game!,"My son, age 6, received this game last year at Christmas. We didn't really get into it until a few month later but then it became a family challenge to figure out the different sections of the game. I really enjoyed helping him with the game, which isn't something I can say about most games. We got stuck at one point but then went to the website to get a hint. I recommend this game to any child who likes solving mysteries. It is probably a bit too hard for a six year old to play alone and can be scary too. BUT, I loved playing this with my son."
2,Luigis Mansion,This game is not very fun. It is very hard to play and to understand. I mean who wants to go around a mansion and suck up ghost if you have to press a million buttons to do it.So DO NOT throw your money away on this horrible game.
1,Way too easy,"This is not Zelda or even Mario...I wish someone would have told us that this game could be completed in no time - and with no book. Very disappointing, because it is so easy and simplistic. I will pass this down to my nephew, who almost finished the game Thanksgiving day as I cooked the turkey. That's how easy most of it is. Final boss is hard though-that's our star for this game!"
2,He's No Mario,"This game was ok. The problems are that it is short, and it is very easy. I wouldn't recommend buying this game."
2,Better Then Mario 64? HA!!! Yeah Right!,"What can I say? This game is boring. Yeah that sounds right, Childish? Very much so. Balenced TOO well!?! Yes. Very much so. ""Luigi's Mansion"" plays out like this (In all the same order):Go into a room.Suck up gousts into your vacume cleaner (???).Find the key.Go unlock the next room.Repeat.Now go directly to jail. Do not pass GO. Do not collect $200 dollers. Even though $200 will buy you your Gamecube, this game will not take off your ming off the spent money with entertainment. Honestly, I can't come up with any reason why anyone would want to spend 6 hours sucking up gousts and then not play the game again! There is no real ending, and the game ends once you figure out that the game is getting boring. Rent only. Unless your of the hardcore type and must own EVERYTHING that is Mario!"
4,Luigi's Mansion. It's so fun it's scary,"This game looks like the best title at release for Gamecube. It is the sequel to Mario Is Missing, but it is alot better. You play as Mario's taller brother, Luigi. Luigi must search a haunted mansion to find his missing brother, who is none other than Mario. (gee, who saw tht coming). You have to capture the ghosts that inhabit the mansion with a vacume cleaner like tool. You have a Game Boy Color that acts as a special camera to help find ghosts. If your looking for a game to start your Gamecube collection with, look no farther than Luigi's Mansion."
5,Hilarious!,I've been a video game aficionado since Pong and since Coleco came out with Donkey Kong Luigi and Mario have been a stable franchise since Nintendo acquired Coleco. This is a fun game that will make you laugh. Never mind that it appears to be for children. The graphics are very well done and the gameplay is smooth. Overall this is a great game!
3,A Few Boos,"Luigi's mansion is a fun game for a boring weekend. Once you master the basics of sucking up ghosts, the game becomes not much more than a time killer. There are, of course, woprse ways to spend your time.Not partivcularly challenging, this was a perfect game to offer at Gamecube's launch. The cutesy graphivd are excellent. However, anyone expecting something similar to past Mario Bros. efforts will be disappointed at the challenge and length of Luigi's Mansion's.It's a fun game to play, but a better rental than a purchase, IMHO."
4,"Good game, but short",This game has great graphics. It's not too hard to follow. But it does provide some challenge. I reccomend this game to people who like a little challenge but doesn't take too long to beat.
1,Terrible,Bought this game to play on my Wii and found out there's a glitch that doesn't allow you to progress any further in the game when u get to a certain point!
3,A cool game,"This is a very original, and beautifully detailed game. It's very short and has little replay value.Mario sunshine is much better."
3,This game is to short and easy,This game is so short I beat it in 2 1/2 hours. But at times it's still fun. Don't buy it rent and beat it don't waste your money.
5,One of the best and worst launch titles for Gamecube...,"This is one of the best launch titles, because it is a really fun game, and it's easy to get into. The controls are great, has a real comfy set-up. Its a bad game because it is way to short, the puzzles repeat themselves, and the bosses are WAY to easy! If you want a real fun game you can get into, get this game. But if you want a game to last more than 6 hours look somewhere else!"
5,should be 5 and not 4 out of 5 stars on the average rating!!,"this game is way better then a 4 out of 5. I think this would be a good second or what ever number og games you have even if it was the only game you play. I got stars wars rouge leader II, luigis mansion, and wave race: blue storm and by far the best game of all was luigis mansion."
4,Scary for ages 5 and under. BOO!,"I'm over the age of 5 and I really enjoyed this game. This game does get aggravating if your stuck on a level and you can suck a ghost up. Yes this does require you to think and use your brain. I thought though, this game was a little scary. Ghosts pop out of the strangest places and scare you with their evil laughs. It's enough to wake the dead (lol). Pearsonally, I don't think this game should be played ages 5 and under beacause some of ghosts and levels will scare them a lot."
4,Worst Game I Ever Bought,I got this game and I was very dissapointed. It is impossible and boring. So what if it was the first game for the Nintendo Gamecube. It is a snooze. I want Star Fox Adventures insted.
1,luigi's mansion is has fungis and mold,"luigi's mansion is mansion is scary (in the stupid way)! BOO! AHi'm so scared.luigi is so UGLY IT'S THE SCARYEST THING ON THE GAME.HE has a vacuum that shoots out fire,water and ice. oh i forgot? it would blow-up.NEVER GET LUIGI'S MANSION IN YOUR LIFE!"
2,"Excellent graphics, Lame game","I went to a store and they let me play LM. The games graphics were the best i've seen. There was metal gear for PS2 on the other side but LM(luigi mansion) grphics were much better.This is nintendo and shiregu miyamoto so it doent surprise me. Now i played for like 30 min. and the the game was BORING. I mean how fun is it to get in like 100 rooms suck like 5 gost in each one and try to find a key. If your liked Yoshis story this is for you(i hated that game). I cant wait like 1 or more weeks for my mom to get me the gamecube super smash brothers melee one extra control and a memory(and i can hopefully get another game out of her). So for now i have to wait to get a good impression out of the Cube. I can wait for zelda(wich is supposely not going to be as good as ocarina as a GAME). I gave instead of one for graphics, realism, and details"
3,Good Game but too short,THe graphics on this game is top notched but the game is too short. I finished this game in about 5 hours. Should have been much longer. for the price of this the challenges should have been longer.
4,A good game,"Luigi's mansion is a pretty good game and though not without its flaws is very fun. The graphics for the most part are very good though there are some blurry textures that should have been fixed up before release. The realtime lighting and shadows are quite simply amazing and easily make up for the handful of blurry textures. The boss fights and some of the puzzles you have to solve to fight the subbosses are extremely innovatetive, I would like to list some but I don't want to spoil it for those of you who have never played. The biggest problem I have with the game is that it is too short, hopfully they will make a longer sequel. In short this is one of the best launch games for the system and is good fun for gamers of all ages."
2,Childish game,This game was obviously targeted at a younger audience. I beat this game in about 7 hours; Way too fast. They definitely made a big mistake by not starting with a Mario Game
4,"Luigi's first game is fun, but short.","Luigi's Mansion is great fun, but it includes a few disappointments. The main thing that might turn gamers off is that it lasts for 4-8 hours. It has beautiful graphics, and easy play control. It is not anything like other Mario Bros. games, so I would prefer you rent it first (Unless you beat it), but if you're a serious Nintendo fan go out and buy it. I promise you will have a blast. Take a look at our ratings below to decide to get it or not.Luigi's Mansion RatingsGraphics- 10/10 Best Graphics out of any of the release games.Play Control- 9/10Satisfaction- 9/10Game Design- 9/10Sound- 7/10Overall- 8.8/10"
3,Good rental... maybe,"This game has great graphics, and is fun for about an hour or two. It is very short- rent it and you can beat it in a day (with plenty of time for breaks). There isn't much to it- once you figure out how to vacuum up ghosts, that's all you do until you have beaten the game (you can't even jump!). It definitely falls short of Mario Bros predecessors like Mario 64."
3,Luigi's Mansion with poor fun.,"The game is great when you first buy it, but the game becomes boring when you repeat each mission to find Mario. The game is really short and compared to games like Agent Under Fire (AUF) or Smashing Drive you wouldn't want Luigi's Mansion (LM)."
4,A shorter game than super Mario 64 but with much more fun!,"In short, get this game! It is amazing no matter what anyone says. some say to only rent this but they are the ones that do not really have it.Graphics: The stunning graphics show you the full EXTENT OF THE gAMECUBES POWER. tHE high detailed areas of the mansion will keep you playing for hours even if it is a it on the short side.Sound/Music: The music and sounds are mostly droned out by Luigis nervous humming and screaming when a ghost sneaks up on him, but the music is however respectable.Gameplay: The gameplay is fabulous thanx to the gcn controller. Luigis Mansion makes full use of all the buttons except maybe the z button.Challenge: At some times this game is a cinch but when you fight boss ghosts such as boolossus,Chauncey, Or Bogmire things start to heat up.Overall: This game lost one star from me because of the sound but it is still loads of fun and like me and many others, get. this. game. PeriodPeeece out yall , Jason"
3,short but sweet,This game was great for about 5 hours. It did get a little annoying though since you do the same thing over and over again. I reccomend for younger kids. The graphics are great in it though- i was very impressed. All in all it was fun while it lasted.
3,Disappointingly short and easy,"The game itself is great--it has awesome graphics and it's a fun concept. However, it only took me about twelve hours to win the entire game. And I have little interest in playing it again, since I've already figured out how to beat each ghost. Having played N64 games like Super Mario and Zelda, I expected it would take me weeks to win Luigi's Mansion.Save your money and rent it."
4,We finished playing it within a week...,"I am not a kid, so you know we can beat the game easily ( I play it with my friends )... I got this and other games together with the game cube as a Christmas gift when they were fresh out in the market. I like this Luigi's Mansion more than the classic Mario... and I like all those spooky stuffs here. Interesting but as the previous review said: it is not easy unless you are 14. I enjoyed it but not addicted to it!Fun: 3.5 starsGame: 4 stars"
3,Painting Mario,"This game is O.K. but it could be better.But I mean who does not like sucking up ghosts and turning them into paintings?Scardy-cats?Well this game is, F.U.N!But boss levels scare me half to death.Especialy the third boss.He is mostly a big boo.Whats a booyou ask?You will see.But I say,BUY THE GAME.You will love it.Well,have fun playing the game.Bye!"
3,luigi,this game isn't the most fun. The storyline is pretty lame but it is not violent and most kids 2 and up would like it.If you are older you probably don't want to buy it for yourself because it will get boring.
3,Luigi's Mansion Review,"I got this game for Christmas and at first it was my favorite game. I beat it the morning of December 26. It's such a short and easy game. It's very fun at first, but it's so short that the fun doesn't last long. The hardest part was beating Bowser, but it only took about ten minutes. I probably wouldn't recommend this game to anyone because it's not worth [the money]. The graphics aren't too great, either. If you're looking for a new game to buy, I recommend Tony Hawk. Luigi's Mansion's a fun game, but Tony Hawk will keep you interested much longer. Luigi's Mansion is only for one player, while Tony Hawk allows you to compete with your friends. If you have millions of dollars and are willing to throw your money around, get Luigi's mansion. If not, get Tony Hawk. By the way, Louisiana rules!"
2,Child's Play,"GameCube's marketed towards a younger audience, and this game proves it. I found this game to be mediocre at best. Anyone twelve years of age or more should have very little trouble finishing this game. The puzzles were quickly and easily solved, and eliminating the ghosts soon became monotonous. And why is it that every Luigi game is him trying to find Mario? Mario is Missing, Mario's Lost in Time, and now Luigi's Mansion. Clearly, Luigi is the superior of the duo, how about his OWN adventure? Definitely a rent before you buy."
5,in love with Luigi,"i am in love with luigi.mario is nice, but luigi is just loveley.well, if you do not own this game bye now you must have been in sibiria or on the moon since november.if you own a gamecube and you are just a tiny bit of a nintendofan - you have to have it - or at least have played it, so rent it.i own it - and it has got its place on the shelf as long as my cube lives."
5,This game is fun,"Its a mix between an adult game and a child game in its complexity (use of controller), but I like it a lot. Any body who says Nintendo is for kids is wrong, Ive been playing them since I was a kid an I love the games they bring. Its really fun for kids and big ones."
2,don't buy this game!!,This game is not fun....it is hard coming from an adult. I did not enjoy the game. The controlls are hard to master and there is no voice sound just reading. I found this game to be very difficult and hard.
2,this is a looser game,I rented this game to see what it was like. Trust me you don't want to buy it. The controls are too hard the graphics aren't that good and there is not much to it. Trust me if you really want this game then rent it first try it out. Otherwise you will be stuck with a bad game.
3,sum it all up,Luigi's mansion is about how luigi looks for mario in a manchine. He meets a guy in the mansion who sucks ghosts up into this device. The man gives it to Luigi so on his voyage to find mario he can have away to defend himself.The game is set around a simple problem. Yet this game is like many others. It's easy to learn hard to master.
1,Nintedo's Follie,"What happened, Nintendo?!? This game has an awful storyline, bad graphics (for Gamecube standards) and, worst of all, is incredibly, excruciatingly BORING! Do yourself a favor and and save your money to buy Starcraft for PC."
1,Good lord what a terrible game this is!,"Let's face the truth: Luigi's Mansion isn't a video game at all, but a demo of the GCN's capabilities. It sure does a great job of showing off everything the system can do, but that's NOT what a game is supposed to accomplish. Ooh, big fancy pretty graphics, I'm so freakin impressed! The gameplay is downright TERRIBLE.And let's not forget that it commits the worst faux pas of the Mario series: an earthbound protagonist! How DARE they publish a Mario game in which you can't jump?? It's unthinkable, I tell you."
1,wrong game,i was sent an x box game .not the luigi's mansion that i order.how will this play on my gamecube.
1,Sooooooooooooooooooooooo Teribble,"This game SOOO Sucked.I bought this 3 weeks ago and the next morning I started playing it on my Game Cube just after 15 minutes of Playing I wanted to straight away go to the mall and return it and now I'm stuck with it. And my best friend told me that it was one of the best games he had, but it totaly reeked (If i could i would give it a zero) and in the quide it exagerated lots and the controls suck!?@ like to turn around you had to to hold down L. So anyone with spending money DO NOT BY THIS GAME. This game is the WORST game i have ever played and i have a humongus video game collection so evryone who buys (or rents) this game you will think it the worst !@?!?game EVER."
1,Tooooooooo Easyyyyyyyyyy,"I brought this game and then in a few minutes I beat the game. It was sooooooooo easyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. if you want a game that will last very very very long, get Shadow the hedgehog or Sonic Heroes. Those beats all of the mario games!"
2,Just RENT this,"I hope it's not a sign of Nintendo products to come. It's very short, at 5 hours, for a game that cost something like 70 dollars Canadian when it first hit, consumers deserve more, with the lack of replayability, this game is about 10+ bucks per hour (when you'll likely play just once). Resident Evil 1 however, also could be beaten in a mere 5 hours (that info SHOULD be printed on the box). Maybe, like Dreamcast, this game will hit 5 dollars sometime, then I'll probably pick it up, because even though it has these problems, part of me wants to rent it again. Maybe it's for the cheesey fun, or for looks, but I thought about it. There should have been a few better modes after beating the game, some mini-games for 4 players or a creative vacuum deathmatch to spruce things up, levels could've been rearranged. This game feels like one level out of what should have been about a 5-7 level game, and the plot is simple, too. I wish he had put that vacuum away at least once!"
3,"Decent Intro Game, Not Close to a Classic","Game is way too short. Controls take some getting used to, but that is most of the fun. No need for a strategy guide. Graphics are well done; Lastability and replay value kill the score. Not much feeling of accomplishment since difficulty level is not there. Good game for younger kids."
3,Fun but yet boring.,"I got this game for Christmas along with a few other games and a GameCube. This game seems really fun at first and has pretty graphics.It's about how Luigi wins a mansion from a contest he did not even enter and it is filled with ghosts. Bad enough,Mario is trapped inside and Luigi must rescue him. You meet this little professer dude in the mansion called Professor E.Gadd or something like that. he gives you a vacuum to help you suck up the ghosts. So what you do is basically suck up ghosts. After a while it does get a little boring and the puzzles are not too hard. I am a 14 year old gamer and say this must be for a younger audience. It isn't totally boring,it still is fun for a while. 3 out of 5"
4,Luigi's Mansion is sooooooo cool!,"hay, gamee cube fans! if you don't have that many games, or wan't to get another one, get luigi's mansion! its not the best,but its a good game! one good thing about it, is that marios not the star! i'm not saying that mario is a bad person, it just that they made too many games with him in it. i'm glad luigi got a wack at it! wounderful game guys!"
3,Too easy....,"The game is very easy, the only think that took me time was the last boss, a little hard but with practice is easy.GRAPHICS: 9/10SOUND: 7/10GAMEPLAY 7/10REPLAY: 2/10CONTROLS 6/10FINAL: 6,2 GET SUNSHINE, OR RESIDENT EVIL! AND RENT THIS ONE"
3,Disappointing,"I made it to the 2nd Boss-Fight and had been loving what was almost a fabulous game.But when I had to suck up the same skeletons about 20 times(Im not exagerating i dont think)because the boss fight is virtually impossible to win i realized I had wasted my money by hiring this game.So many GameCubes are just too hard.Don't get the wrong idea..I'm up to a challenge,but no-one wants to feel like a kid who is playing against an unfair,cheating big brother!Thats what its like!!It should be just a tad easier and a tad more fair.A fun,challenging game became monotnous,tedious and boring.Thats such a mistake by the game makers.It really is a shame that what could have been a terrific game was ruined."
3,Cool game,"I am a big fan of Mario & Luigi. This game is fun and I recommend it for everyone. You control Luigi and work your way through different floors in a mansion. The object of the game is to find Mario who has dissappeared in the mansion. By using a vacuum cleaner, you have to capture ghosts then recieve keys to different rooms in the mansion. The graphics are awesome and catching the ghosts does get challenging in some areas. I give it 3 stars because you can beat it in a few hours. Buy it used like I did, or rent it and you will get your money worth."
5,So Awesome,"I first saw this game on a news show and i was like i had to have it, and i totally hate video games but this one is so much fun!!! you actually get to explore a manshion and stuff well in other words this game is awesome!!! GET IT!!!!!!"
5,i love this game!!!!!!,pros. good graphics. the game is hillarious. many diffrent ghosts. finally it is Luigis time to stand in the spotlightcons. too easy to beat. it can be boring to go back and capture all the Boos
4,"Spooky, but VERY cool!","Luigi's mansion is the greatest game I ever played! When I first played it I was very confused, and spooked! Then I got used to the game and now, I'm a professional ghost vacuumer! I'll tell you about it. See, Luigi won a mansion in a contest that he didn't even enter! So he sends Mario up to check it out, and Mario doesn't come back. So Luigi goes to check the mansion. He gets there, goes into the parlor and what does he see? A GHOST! Also, an strange old man in a white coat chasing it! He sees Luigi and tells him to run, he'll follow. They get to the old man's lab and go inside. The old man gives Luigi a vacuum and tells Luigi to take it to suck up the ghosts. He gives him a small explanation of how to use it and a demonstration. So now Luigi's job is to venture into the mansionand suck up ghosts and find Mario! Very interesting, huh? Hope this is helpful!"
3,"Way, Way to short.","This game is fun, okay, dont get me wrong there. you go around and suck up stuff and its fun. i rented this game on a saturday and i got hooked and i was finished by 8:00 that night. this would have been a 4 star but its just too short. its worth a rent, but dont waste 30 bucks on it."
3,Fun while it lasts.,"I was happy to here that Luigi was going to star in his own videogame for the Gamecube. When I got the game, it was FUN but after 3 hours, it was getting boring. Another hour and I beat the game. That's right, it only took me 4 hours to beat the game. So heed my words, RENT BEFORE YOU BUY."
4,preety cool game,this is a cool game you start out in the maosion you have to find a key easy it gets harder you met this guy all you started off with was a flashlight he gives you a 2000 vacum or something some people think this is easy my opion it takes you a long time to beat it because i have never beat it but it is not easy you get the flashlight you have to find the ghosts and shine the flashlight until a little heart shows the ghosts get harder as you get farther into the game you get stuff like fire ice and water you can shoot out of your vacum when you get father into the game then there is tresure you find in the game and i have the stagey guide and at the end with the tresure you can buy a house or a masion depending on how much money you earnded it would do no good if you rented it it would take you probley two weeks to beat it
5,Luigi's Mansion is way cool !!!!,I think Luigi's Mansion is awesome. I think it should be rated #1 because it's fun and challenging. It's cool because they give you clues where Mario is. That's why I think it should be rated #1.
5,"Smart, funny game","This game is a hoot. Graphics are terrific, with all the nifty GC features like moving light sources, fog, etc. Superb detail. Hilarious character: Luigi hums along with the soundtrack nervously while searching dark rooms. When the lights are on, he whistles along in relief.Downside: the game is pretty easy. Children will enjoy it immensely...the ghosts are pretty non-threatening, although sometimes surprising. If you're looking for something with the sophistication of Mario or Zelda or DK64, this isn't quite it (at least, not so far...I'm about halfway in).Annoying thing: the Prof. E. Gadd character's pseudo-speak. It's made up of Japanese phonemes, but it just sounds silly. Kids, again, may find this less annoying."
2,Luigi's Mansion-for children,"This game will be fine for youngsters. However, I, as an adult gamer felt the game ended way too soon, way too easily. The graphics are fabulous, but the game is a big disappointment. This is by far the easiest game I have played, and also the shortest."
5,LUIGI TO THE RESUCE!!!!!,Luigi Mario's little brother has to save his brother Mario from a terrible fate from ghost and ghouls in this New Adventure Starting Luigi
4,it was ok.....,"Yes the game was quite good. Cept not enough challenge. The only hard thing was figuring out how to make picture ghosts weaknesses exposed. However beating King Boo, was quite difficult, but eventually i was able ti kick his bum! after you beat King Boo, there is a star next to the gameboy horror. I dont know what it symbolizes, but my best guess is that the stun of the flashlight wears off faster, because catching orange ghosts was harder with the star. I beat normal mode in 3hours! =| well it was fun.... its ok..... however a GREAT game to get used to gamecube is Super Monkey Ball, and that one can be HARD on expert! INCREDIBLY HARD!Dannyboy =)"
3,yay-ug-yay-ug,"ok, first off, this is an ok game. i didn't hate it, i didn't love it. the plot is very, um, non-original (hello, vaccum cleaner that sucks ghosts, sounds like a couple of movies i heard of). Great graphics and gets u hooked, but waaaaaaaayyyy 2 short. I finished it with no help from the internet or a guide and i usually need help. i got my gc for when zelda came 2 it, i would have the equipment. i could only afford 1 game, so i chose the mansion. i thought it would b like mario 64, looks short but playz long. BOY WAS I WRONG. buy this game for show or when ur bored, not for hours of fun. i fininshed it in 3 days of 2 hours. start this as ur collection, great graphics, great ""adventure"" i'd say 2 and a half."
5,I love this game,I brought this game for my kids but I enjoy playing it with them. The shipping time was very good.
4,"Great, but low replay value","I was absolutely blown away by the graphic and sound quality of this game. I loved that the entire game is within one huge castle, and that the names of each room pop up when you enter them. And I loved the music room, where you use instruments to ""play"" old Super Mario Bros. theme songs. Luigi even hums and whistles along (nervously) to the background music.The control also is incredible, and very natural-feeling, using both joysicks and all the buttons.However, my buddy and I finished it in one night, about 6 hours of playing (taking turns on rooms). And after that, we had no desire to play anymore. Rent this and wait for the first GameCube Mario game."
3,Is this game for you??,"This game is pretty fun in all aspects. But, I love every mario and luigi game that has been created; so does that count? The only thing bad about this game is that it is way to easy. I bought it and had beat it in six days!!! Another thing is its not that much fun to play again. So I would recommend renting this game, it's cheaper and you get the same thing out of buying it. But don't get me wrong this is a very fun game."
3,Luigi's Mansion,"Luigi's Mansion is a good game, until you finish it. The graphics are of the best the GameCube can offer on the first-gen titles, but others games are better than LM in graphics (Rogue Leader, Smash Bros. Melee, etc). The sound is not the best thing ever, but it's good. The value of the game is BAD. Finish it in 10 hours. A short game compared to other games like Super Mario 64. And it's always the same thing. Capture a ghost, get a key and enter the next room. And do it again. The gameplay is regular.RATING:Gameplay: - 19/30Graphics: - 18/20Sound: ---- 16/20Value: ---- 6/30TOTAL: 59/100 -----------> MediocreComments: A good game until you finish it. Rent it or ask a friend for lend it to you. If you want to buy it, consider another options, like Smash Bros. Melee or Rogue Squadron 2. Another game of its kind very recommendable is Pikmin. But you have the last word."
3,OK NOT BAD BUT NOT GREAT,This game is ok. I gave it a 3 because it is a little too short I was thinking it would take a few weeks. Also because it might get boring after a while. If you just bought a gamecube and got enough money and will get this get it with something else because soon you'll get tired of it soon...
3,To buy or not to buy...,"This should be a simple decision:1) If you have played it and liked it, then buy it. (Remember it is a short though)2) If you played it and did not like it, then do not buy it.3) But whatever your decision, make sure that you do play it sometime.Personally, I liked the game. I thought it was fun and had good graphics/sound. However, it is a short game and sucking up ghosts with a vacuum only appeals to me for so long. I think this will be a great game to rent (...)"
1,lame.......,"this game is horrible. it is fun the first time you go through it but after you beat it, it isn't fun at all. it takes about 4 hours to beat so please, please, please rent this game for a few days. If you have two thumbs you should have it beat. To top it off the story is horrible. you ""won"" a mansion but there are ghosts in it and this magical old guy gives you this magical vacuum that sucks up ghosts, table cloths, fire, water and you use it to get your brother (mario) out of a picture. I mean come on."
1,dumb dumb dumb,I bought this game thinking it would be another of nintendos master pieces. I was wrong It took me 3-4 hours to beat it then after I beat it it was no fun If I was you I would never buy it. Rent it then you can beat it and say you did. I need to sell mine now though. Get Mario Sunshine its awesome.
1,really -REALLY- boring,i can't believe how boring this game is. it's really linear and the things that you are forced to do aren't that fun. it doesn't even seem to have a plot. the fact that this game has such great reviews makes me really nervous about having wasted $(...) on a gamecube.
4,A Decent Game...,"This game is really fun and exciting. The only problem is that you finish the game in 3 days tops. And what's this hidden mansion junk when you beat the game, I mean who would make a slightly different mansion with the same ghosts and all just to make it long!?! But it's still fun as you suck up ghosts.A really cool thing you can do is get these medals allowing you to suck up elemental-ghosts allowing you to shoot fire, water, and ice.Your main objective is to save Mario from a bunch of ghosts and restore the boss ghosts into paintings, sounds easy huh? Well actually it's not, each boss ghost can hide from light. That's the only way you can suck them up with your vacuum cleaner, by stuning them with light. So you will be forced to find a flaw like wait till they yawn so you can catch them off guard.I suggest you buy this game used, just don't except it to be long!"
3,Different But Good,"I think this game is pretty good, though you don't do much. You just run around chasing ghosts. I also think it's kind of scary, but it's probably because I'm only nine and I'm scared of the dark. This game is very difficult and there's a lot of places you have to find and defeat and, not to mention, Luigi is kinda slow. The reason I think that it's 3/5 is because I think it's cool but it's too complicated. And you almost NEED the stratedy guide. But still, I think it deserves three stars."
2,Just not the expected Mario quality,"This game doesn't compare to the other Mario games. Although the story sounds cool, there just isn't much exitement in sucking up ghosts with a vacuum cleaner. It's very monotonous; there aren't really any different places to go and although the ghosts vary in color and shape, they all basically work the same. It's more frustrating than challenging. I don't know - the areas and ghost-sucking may not bore you like it bored me. Perhaps one of the few good sides to this game is that it's interesting and unique. But the game play is definatly missing something. Koopas maybe."
4,Great Game!,"This game is great!Here is what I think of this game:sound:9/10story:7/10gameplay:9/10controls:6/10If you like mario games, buy this game!"
3,"Good, Good","I just bought this game. I decided to wait until it got cheap to spend some money on it due to the... well simply put ""bad"" reviews on it. Definately this game was awesome when i first started to play it...the graphics dazzled me. Since i have a ps2 and i just got a gamecube it was alot to handle. Well it was alittle boring after a while, but if you a hardcore mario(and luigi) game fan(like me) then you will definately find this game fun. Sure there are some boring parts but it has it's moment, overall i'll give this game a 3.5 star rating."
4,Repetitive but still alright.,"First off i would like to say i only got this game to start off the gamecube world. So the game does get repetitive-catch ghost, turn on lights, save Mario-thats about it. Anywho... the graphics are good and the sound is alright. the only thing i can't do is get this plant outside of the mansion to give me a ruby. I really recomend this game for kids 5-11 about."
2,luigis mansion goes down the drain,This game stinks it does have a good graphics to it but the gameplay is worst then boring after five minutes you will feel like you wasted your money and you will walk away.take my word for it DONT BUY IT.
3,Short and Sweet,"It's a relatively short game with hardly any replay value. It's a nice little game to wet your appetite until bigger and better games reach the GameCube. It's easy to control, relatively easy to beat the game, and pretty fun to play. I'd probably look at a second-hand video game store for this one though. Either that, or rent it for 3 to 5 days."
3,Ok game game if you are willing to play for hours on ned,This is a good game but it takes a while to get used to and is very annoying for the controller
2,"Too simple, too short","While there is nothing terribly wrong with this game, it is way too simple and way too short. I was able to beat the game in 3 days. The gameplay is solid, but there isn't enough variety to warrant a purchase. Good for young children, or for people new to videogames. Otherwise, it only warrants a rental."
3,A Launch Game That Might Not Be Worth Your Time,"Luigi's Mansion may be a good game for young,fresh,new gamers,but expirienced gamers,like myself,might find this game a little short.It's as long as Pokemon Snap!Besides that,it's one of the best games from the GameCube launch.Just make sure you like a game that would take a seasoned player 15 minutes to get to the first boss."
3,"Luigi's Mansion - Quality, however not long","Luigi's Mansion, to put it simply, is the perfect weekend rental. The title garnered a total of ten hours of gameplay out of me, and has not been touched since. Don't get me wrong, the game wasn't bad or anything, it was just really short.Boasting some new gameplay as opposed to the usual platformer fare, the puzzles in Luigi's Mansion, as well as bosses, were fun while they lasted. A fairly simple game, Luigi's Mansion is not something that an experienced gamer should probably buy, unless they'd just like it in a collection for some reason.For the family game, this doesn't do too badly, although the fifty dollar price tag isn't justifiable. A good game for teaching parents and small children to play a game, I'd recommend Pikmin as a puzzle game over this, and Mario Sunshine as a Mario game above this.Three stars justifies the good quality, as well as super short playtime. Try renting it before buying it."
3,"This game is O.K,","My future brother in law gave me this game cause he didnt like I played it for like 10 min, and its not that bad, it could of been better, if it was Mario's Mansion, but Luigi put on a great performance."
1,Worst game of the year?,"Imagine paying (...)your hardearned money (ok, or your parents' hardearned money) and get zero value. That doesn't sound exciting, does it? Well that's exactly what you get with Luigi's Mansion. There is zero fun factor and zero play value. In fact, Nintendo should pay us to play."
3,Over too quickly,I bought this game for my 8 year old son and he enjoyed it for the 2 weeks that it took to finish it.
3,Not awful but it's not good.,"I must admit that the Gamecube is very impresive in graphics and Luigi Mansion (Luigi's Mansion) proves it but when it comes to gameplay it's bad. I mean you can win the entire game in a couple of boring 10 hours. Another thing is that it's always the same thing,suck up ghosts,get key and find the next room, over and over. So as my advice to everyone is this one, just rent itor play it at your friend's house(if s/he has a copy of it,of course)."
3,ok listen upp to Me,this game is good but very hardddddddddd!!not easy unless your 14 or older if you want this game i think you should realy get the stratagy guide thats wat helped me beat the game. the bosses are easy its the way getting to the levels thats hard. bowser is hard but nott so hard hes easy after a couple of turns.the game is good but not the best you should probaly go for super mario sunshine now thats a good game
2,Will Nintendo ever speak?,I bought this as a Xmas gift for my niece. But I thought I'd try it myself because I've enjoyed every Mario related game to date. This was my first experience with Gamecube. I don't see any big advantage with this game over any older NES system. I was really floored to see that the characters still speak with quote bubbles and not with a voice! Come on...get with the new age of video games! Graphics were nothing to write home about either. I was bored in a matter of minutes. I'd rather play one of the other Mario titles.
5,the best game ever of nintendo.,this is a cool game because mario gets all the fame so luigi gets the star and roll and luigi is not a baby if he went in the haunted mansion to get his bro.and i like the under dog but it has good grafics and most of my friends took 4 years to get to king boo and catch all 50 boos theres a big reward its the best games you should buy it.
4,boo!,"luigi's mansion is very scary.It has ghosts. It even have some ghosts that look like women,men,boys,& girls.You have a vacume to vacume the ghosts.There is even a gameboy that tells you what things that are. If you use the gameboy on a mirror,then the mirror will be blocked by blue circle then you will spin,then you will end up at the room you begin at each level. I only got up to level 2. That level you need to find all the boo's to unlock doors."
3,Luigi hasn't got it this time...,"When I started playing Luigi's Mansion,I started going farther and farther into the game. Luigi's Mansion does get hard at some points and it is not a walk in the park for the rest of the game also. Luigi's Mansion is not as easy as you might think, so if you get to a hard part, don't give up. Try and try and you'll get it.THIS GAME IS ONE PLAYER ONLY!!! so if you have a brother or sister or someone you want to play this game with, you'll have to take turns because luigi's mansion is only one player.If you like mario and nintendo characters, I would suggest games like super smash bros. melee or mario kart double dash because luigi's mansion's characters are ONLY luigi and some with mario."
4,"Hey, it's a Luigi game!","Now, this game is good, but it has a major problem. It's way to short. I'm a Nintendo supporter so I bought it but it could have been a lot longer. The game, while it lasted, was sweet. The controls may be confusing for a 5 yr. old, but personaly they were easily mastered. The graphics are brilliant with no sign of slow-down anywhere. Another graphical master piece... that you should rent first at a blockbuster to see if you want to lay down the dow for this title. Good ghost hunting to you."
3,A worthwhile effort.,"Although I was considering giving this game 4 stars, the game is just too short to deserve that rating. However, the game is very innovative and interesting to play. The game also challenges the player's mind a bit (or maybe I'm just stupid). The only way to play this game, for me, is to collect all of the money and all of the boos. The graphics are decent, sound is repetitive, gameplay has a bit of variety, and the control scheme is decent once the player gets used to it. However, the short gameplay time and lack of a multiplayer mode means that this game may be collecting dust in a week or two. Still, it is an innovative piece of software and it is worth looking in to."
2,ten hours of play?! What!,"well, i bought this game about 3 months ago and i got bored with it after about 2 weeks. it was really dissapointing. there is only one drawback to this game but it is huge. for the average gamer there is only about ten hours of play time until you beat the game. But, otherwise the game has great graphics and good play control, but that still cannot make up for the actual game length. My advice? DONT BUY IT. its not worth the money"
3,Great Graphics but much too short,"This was the first game I bought when we bought GC and I have to admit I am somewhat disappointed. The graphics themselves look very realistic but I can't believe that I finished the game so soon. You would hope when you spend [money] on a game it would be worth it but it just isn't the case here. You can pick up this game used for [money] on [local store] now so that says a lot. If your looking for a great GC game, try Super Monkey Ball instead. Or buy this used if you HAVE to have it. I wish I did."
4,"Luigi goes solo, Ghostbusters style","I'd say this is a fun game. It is a puzzle/adventure game in which you catch ghosts using a flashlight and a vaccuum. That's right. A vacuum. Despite the plot, there is really nothing scary here, but there is a good, medium difficulty adventure. Catching ghosts means exposing their weak spot and then vacuuming them in a fishing style. Buy it used or rent it. It's very short."
4,Fun for a time....,"You see, I have certain times where I love one or two games and then that changes. Right now I feel like rating the game two stars or something because I'm just in one of those don't like it phases. But when I do like it I would probally rate it five or something. But the reason why I got so sick of it is because there's only one thing to do and tha's to win the game and you are almost always in the mansion and except for when the lights are on in rooms it's all dark and gloomy. Trust me you'll get sick of it. I paid twenty dollars for it which was good so if you find it for that much then you should buy it but trust me, you'll get sick of it and when you do get sick of it you'll get really sick of it...."
3,"Superb Graphics, lacking of gameplay",I will make this short. Luigis mansion was a nintendo gamecube launch and looked very promesing. The graphics were wonderful but the game was way to bad. This game was really aimed for younger audiences for ages 9 or something like that. And the game is to short. It took me like 8 hours to beat the game. Over all the game is lacking alot of things. One is lengh. The rest you just see for your self.ProsGraphicsConsgameplayway to short.The gameplay wasn't that fun at all. Stick with Mario Sunshine.3.2 out of 5Lates
4,"good, but not a game worth buying",This was a rush finish so t could come out when Gamecube came out. The graphics are pretty good. It's basically the same music throughout the game. Sucking up ghosts in a vacumm gets old quick. Rent this game before you buy it.
2,Skipped it,"I skipped renting or owning this game because it's only an hour long. I did not like what I saw when I played it in store, so I decided to never play the game again. Overall, it's just not Nintendo's best effort and is clearly a launch title that was rushed in the end so it could drop in stores the day the system did."
4,Luigi's Mansion B00005Q8LR,Great game and it has neat graphics! Bowser is the last boss you fight. Its also a classic and I dont think you'll ever find a game that has Luigi alone as the main character.
3,Where's Mario?,"I think this game was fun at first but it lost it after 30 min. This game is mostly for kids, not really adults. It was ok, for a Luigi game. Not as good as Mario though, if your thinking about buying this wait for Super Mario Sunshine instead"
5,GAME OF THE YEAR!!!,"LUIGI'S MASION IS AND WAS THE BEST GAME I'VE PLAYED IN YEARS SENCE MARIO & LUIGI'S GAMES BACK IN THE DAY. IT WAS EXCITMENT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE GAME. I LIKE THE CLUES I RECEIVED FOR THE BOOS AND THE GRAPHICS AND SOUND EFFECT WERE EXCELLENT. I BEAT THE GAME, BUT THERE WAS ONE ROOM I COULD NOT CONQUER. THE ROOM WITH THE BOO EATING @ THE TABLE WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU SUPPOSE TO DO, I DID EVERYTHING MORE INFO WAS NEEDED. BUT ALL AND ALL I LOVED THE GAME PURCHASE 2 GAMES 1 FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN AND 1 FOR MY SON. BUT ANOTHER CASTLE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED ONCE YOU BEAT THE FIRST CASTLE. I SAW HIDDEN CASTLE BUT IT WAS THE SAME. BLEW MY MIND! NEEDED MORE! ANOTHER CASTLE WOULD HAVE SET THE GAME CORRECT, IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. THE GAME SET WAS LIKE A MOVIE THE ENDING WAS FAIR BUT. (EXAMPLE) TAKE MARIO TO THE PRINCESS FIGHT THOUGH THE FOREST BOOS AND GHOST TREES TRYING TO PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING IT TO YOUR DESTINY. JUST AN IDEA."
2,A major let down,Sure the graphics and sound are great but it does not live up to the Mario games of the past.(I have played and beat them all) This game took a total of 6 hours to beat. There was no real challenge to it. The puzzles weren't even close to hard. For 50$ I would expect a game to take longer to beat. I think Nintendo was more concerned with graphics than the actual game.
2,Not for anyone over 15,"I played this when I went home over Thanksgiving and I must say I was diappointed. Sure, the graphics are nice, but the rest of the game is nothing to get excited about. The sound gets annoying, the gameplay is boring, and the entire game is far far too easy. I've been losing faith in Nintendo ever since zelda 64 came out. Their games are too simple and too easy to have any extended use, other than a few games. If you're looking for another mario 64, keep looking."
5,great read,"i have lived in japan for the last 20 years, having completed my doctorate in japan, and being married to a japanese woman. i feel as though i may have some qualification to comment on this book, as opposed to the neo-japanologists who may have only spent a year or two in japan. i really enjoyed this book for what it is, a light-hearted and humorous account of a bicycle trip through japan. her accounts are spot on, and i find them even more so after all this time. i cannot agree that she has a racist outlook to the japanese or demeans them in any way. it is just an author describing what she sees, not what you want her to see. i find this refreshing and do not see the need to subscribe to a politically correct format in her style of reporting. she seems a regular person who is out to enjoy a bike ride without the politics.all in all i can recommend this book for anyone who wants a great travel read or an insight into japan."
3,the wheels go 'round,"josie dew is one of my favorite cycling writers, but.... this time she seems to have gone overboard. 700 pages of what seems like a transcribed journal-snore. her first two books are excellent. for a hilarious view of americans, try-""travels in a strange state"". i sincerely wish ms. dew a rapid recovery!"
1,Over priced,"I bought this new at a Borders about 4 years ago and paid about $60. If you pay $150, you're getting ripped off. It's a great set, but not at this price."
4,Whip Hand.,"Deliver Me From Dallas written (mostly) by the legendary Charles Willeford was first published in 1961 as Whip Hand by someone named W. Franklin Sanders. Surprisingly little information about Sanders is revealed in the introduction of Deliver Me From Dallas. Just that he and Willeford met at Marin Community College circa 1950.Deliver Me From Dallas is a short crime novel featuring a rogue LA cop named Bill Brown and three slow witted Okies. The lion's share of the narrative takes place in and around Dallas, unfamiliar territory to all four men.Most of the conventions of pulp fiction are adhered to, though the ending is a bit of a surprise. The book is periodically punctuated with acts of horrendous violence presented in matter-of-fact style....a well known Willeford trademark.Mandatory reading for the true Charles Willeford fan."
5,Inspiring work!,"As a lifetime amateur astronomer, I can appreciate the mastery an inspiring insights of this wonderful author. Written with wit and scientific accuracy, I recommend this book without reservations to the lay audience and professionals alike. Excellent job!"
4,A COMPREHENSIVE COMPUTER ENCYCLOPAEDIA,"Unlike most other computer dictionaries/encyclopaedias in its class, the inclusion of a companion CD-ROM gave this ""Computer Desktop Encyclopedia"" a comfortable jump-start in the superiority contest.The book (and its attached CD-ROM) covered, in the most definitive way, all the important terms and acronyms that apply to today's computer and networking technologies. Hardware, software, and allied peripherals were adequately represented.It is descriptive and well-illustrated, and included all the commonly used file extensions. With over ten-thousand terms and definitions, its scope is rich: in comparison to what exist now.This computer encyclopedia ranks among the best currently on sale. However, potential buyers may be frustrated (at the moment) by its limited availability."
3,Warm But Not The Greatest,"First off the horseshoe isn't that big and its off centered. The only good thing about the beanie is its warm, but if you're looking for a great Colt's product this is not the one."
1,This bedtime story will definitely put you to sleep,"This is one of the most dreadfully boring films I have seen in quite some time. It is 100% talk about nothing really. Fairy tales are supposed to be fun and entertaining stories for children. There is not a child in the world that could sit through this torture. Koreans should be furious with the director for trying to pawn this jive off on them as a fairy tale from the ""Far East."" Hooey! This plays out like a 2-hour Benneton commercial. Any reviewer that lists this as fun, entertaining, inspiring, or excellent had to have been paid off. Blatant lies. Don't say you haven't been warned. I lost my $7.50 so you won't have to lose yours."
2,Coulda been,"This is a very talky film, interesting in some respects, but script flawed and technically quite annoying. There are many long scenes of people just sitting/standing around and talking. Following the thread of the film was difficult.Worse was the SOUND!!! When a camera moved in close, the actors whispered, often barely moving their lips. My wife, with acutely good hearing, could hardly make out any of such speeches. In one early and very important explanatory scene, the person explaining was speaking Japanese (?) while her daughter translated, both speaking loudly at the exact same time! What could the director have been thinking??? Idiocy.This is becoming all too common in films over the past 10 years or so as actors, directors and technicians strive for ""reality."" What they lose, however, is communication to the audience. If you can't be heard or understood, you might just as well never have been in the film or on a stage."
3,Lady in the Water,"I think this is an under-rated piece of work. It's not earth-shattering, but is original and creative. There isn't the same tension as seen in ""Sixth Sense"", but it is still enjoyable. I found the story tight, well-constructed, and felt comfortable with even M.Night's acting."
2,Bummer,"I just saw this on DVD. I wanted real hard to like it, because I thought after his first three movies he had become a genius, ""Signs"" was perfect in ways, and I really didn't think ""The Village"" fell off that much.Unfortunately, everything that's been said about this movie is correct. It had zero payoff, she flies off with the friggin' eagle, so what? There were way too many characters, no wonder the tenants couldn't figure who was suppose to fill what role. And the whole thing was so complicated I didn't care if the lawn monster ate them all by the end. All in all, it (gulp) sucked.The guy can make movies, but after this let's hope he gets some help with scripts. Even Hitchcock didn't write all his own material. Well, he's still very young, we'll see."
1,Don't waste your time on this....,"What an awful and silly movie! The plot is absurd, the special effects are ridiculous and the acting is entirely forgettable."
2,he still has an audience after ''signs'' ?!?!?!?!?!?!?,"his ''ideas'' are good for 20 mins of screen time.after that its all yapping and boredom for the next 2 plus hours.6th was his only movie that kinda/sorta had me watching all the way through,once.and being a bruce willis/sam jackson fan,i gave unbreakable a shot,once.what do people find so impressive about a director taking fantastical stories and putting them on film ?!?!?!?uuummmm,most directors do this.nights problem is he loves himself too much and he deceives his followers every time.not once did he scare me or even shock me.and in between the so called scares are hours of talking.im sure all 25 of his die hard fans will check this out.theyll fool heartily watch anything night makes and convince themselves they enjoyed it."
5,We Need More Like This,"I felt that this movie was very good! If you are a fan of fairy tales, and bed time stories, you'll love it. I think we need more movies like this instead of blood and gore that's out there now."
2,Don't get on Amazon under the influence!,"Which is why I ended up with a receipt from 3am for Lady in the Water. It's an interesting story if you're not the type to care about plot, story line or characters. So...I guess maybe this movie would be good for Helen Keller. Buy it if you have absolutely, and I mean even ""Buckwild"", nothing to watch."
3,wait for tv,If i hadn't needed to watch this for a class i would never have paid for it. Its not a bad movie its just not that great. The acting isn't horrible for the most part just the storyline is typical and bad.
2,Flush this one down,"I am a fan of the first four Shymalan directed movies (yes that includes The Village). Also read the book about the making of (and almost non making of) Lady in the Water which intrigued. Love Bryce Dallas Howard. She being the title ""Lady"" I was interested to see this. LITW tries to create a new mythological story, and it is ultimately a messy failure on all levels except the acting (from all seasoned professionals at least). It is not moving, it is not scary, it is not thrilling, it is confusing and pointless. Scatterbrained would have been a better title. Whatever has gone wrong with M Night apparently started well before the making of this film. It is sad and inexplicable, but this movie does not continue his streak of hits, it is a turd sandwich from a formerly talented chef - do yourself a favor and skip it."
3,movie critic,"it is a fun movie, but not a classic where you want to watch it over and over. It is definitely worth seeing. My brother loves it and I bought it for him for christmas."
5,New favorite,"Professional reviewers have forgotten how to enjoy a movie. It is my wife's new favorite and I myself have viewed it at least 3-4 times and enjoyed it each time. It has a child-like innocence that most movies don't have any more. There are way too many sick, demented horror movies. This was a refreshing change. I wish there were more like it. No sexual scenes or vulgar language. What a disappointment it must have been to those craving an immoral, bloody, perverse movie."
2,A flop long overdue,"Shaymalan's winning streak had to end somewhere, I suppose this one is it. The sixth sense and Unbreakable were masterpieces, following which was a gradual decline. If Shyamalan wants to establish himself as the Alfred Hitchcock of our time, he will have to choose better stories. I think Shayamalan is enormously capable but his success will depend on his staying ahead of viewers' expectations. If the viewers are expecting a big twist, he will have to deliver an even bigger twist! Sorry, but that's how he has ended up casting himself, and it's upto him to live upto it."
4,Fairytale quality,"This is a good family flick with a fairytale quality. When a sea nymph travels to land to help men escape some of the depravity they've immersed themselves in, she touches the lives of some very unique personalities living in an apartment building. The nymph completes her mission with the help of the apartment handyman/manager, but her return home is hindered by a wicked wolf-like creature determined to destroy her. Beautiful story!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
2,"""Man may have forgotten how to listen""","This interpretation of a bed time story that first introduces characters weirder than the ones in ""Batteries Included."" We are lead to believe they are all in some sort of transition in life and are given a purpose. On the surface they are helping a fairytale character get back to her world.The film has a ""B"" movie knockoff of a Spielberg feel. Every time they look up you expect a bicycle crossing the moon.The characters and the actors look like cardboard knockoffs of famous actors more than people. Bryce Dallas Howard in make up looks like a young Tilda Swinton.Then ""Whisper in the Noise"" mangles a great Dylan song ""Times are a Changing""Grate concept - pitiful execution.Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits"
2,Paul Giamani - GET OUT OF THE WATER!,"I am a big fan of Paul Giamani ever since ""Sideways"". He is a funny actor. I couldn't quite take him seriously in this movie. This was not supposed to be a funny movie, but I found myself laughing at the most inappropriate times. He just didn't belong in this B movie. The whole story sounded as though a group of kids had made it up as they went along with no real meat to it. I found myself asking, ""And the point of the movie was?????"" To Paul Giamani: You need a new agent. You're wasting your talent. There are better movies out there for you, dear! But thanks for a few laughs in an otherwise BAD movie!"
5,worth waiting for,"This was charming,easy to watch,surprisingly differant from what I was led to believe.You have to have an open mind to understand this movie."
2,The sound was horrible......,I guess this one was for theater viewing only. I had to blast the sound because the character Story always has to whisper. Other background sounds and music were blasting because the volume was so high. I have no idea why this was done. M. Night Shyamalan was good in the movie. I was surprised by him but Noah Gray-Cabey was the best actor by far. June Kyoto Lu is pretty good too.
3,"Ok, enjoyable, but somehow not satisfying","To be honest, I enjoyed the Village a bit more than this film. I like the attempt of making this film based on pure imagination, but the execution was off.Some of the characters in the apartment were forgettable, and cartoonish, and watching the movie was like trying to figure out what type of movie I'm really watching---is it comedy? adventure? fairy tale? all of the above? Somehow the bits and pieces doesnt add up and fit together quite nicely.I still find this movie enjoyable in the end, but it's one of those films that you watched and forget. Nothing stays with you after the curtain was closed."
1,One of the Worst Films I ve Ever Seen,"Please stay clear of this. Its just awful. Certainly all the issues begin with the script and M. Night's self indulgent filmmaking. The story is so trite and forced, its offensive. I mean, to expect people to take this story, this film and the scenarios in it serious is ludicrous. But I fear some are and perhaps this will only reinforce Shymalan's concept of his own genius, which is in dire need of a moment of clarity. I really think that he must have some odd ""only God can judge me"" complex and has decided he may do whatever the hell he wants in his films without justifying anything or building a complex story that is coherent. He s lazy, sloppy, cheap and is an awful actor. And I think he must have missed any of the info at NYU on not using exposition in his films, because thats the only pony these characters are riding the entire way.Just please, pass this one on. Its truly terrible."
1,What a twist? Is this even a movie?,"Look, I want to make this painfully clear: This is a terrible movie. I cannot believe this was supposed to be smart and beautiful movie. What the hell was this? The gag where the critic is so annoying an a helpless victim of a director that is just bitter. The story is ridiculous and an insult to those with a brain stem. I am so sorry about this negative review, it pains me to do this. I am so positive with my reviews but I am just that: a passionate reviewer. Watch it if you must but I warned you, hey, maybe you'll like it. Maybe not. But watch it and judge for yourself."
1,pay no attention to shyamalans dwindling herd ...,"this movie is an absolute mess. this is no fairy tale, it is 1/2 m night self fellation and 1/2 m night whining about those who dont like his self fellation, disguised as a fairy tale.there is no ""getting in touch with your inner child"" in this movie as the shyamalan fanatics seem to insist. unless, of course, your inner child appreciates endless exposition with no worthwhile payoff.the rave user reviews claiming that this movie is a masterpiece are coming from the keyboards of those still brainwashed by the endless m night hype machine. proceed with caution."
2,Faith world,"This film is a flop in many ways. The story is complex, and the specifics are difficult to follow because much of the key dialogue is mumbled by the two lead actors. You can cut the multicultural political correctness with a knife. And the computer monsters are designed for people under 15. Oh, it's all so scary and creepy. But not for grownups. Perhaps the larger point to make about the film is that people are hungry to believe--in virtually anything except Christianity with its moral demands. In short, this is yet another weak film for teens, unsatisfactory in many ways except for the fine acting of Paul Giamatti."
2,WHAT HAPPENED SHYMALAN,"WOW! THIS MOVIE WAS STUPID! I LIKED THE MONKEY THINGS AND THE WHOLE WOLF WITH GRASS SCENES! BUT STILL, IT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME TO EVEN CONSIDER THIS MOVIE GOOD!"
4,The last of M Nights good movies,It was an interesting concept but not a new one for sure; using the deconstruction of a movie plot as the plot. I liked the way they handled it and all the actors saved the weak writing making this movie worth watching.
2,Bad Movie,"Paul Giamatti is great in this film, as he has been in every film I've seen him in. Giamatti is pretty funny and there are some other humorous moments in the film, but they are the only positives about this film, and the only thing that save it from getting a 1 star rating from myself. The story itself is just silly, I really can't think of a better word to describe it. The most ridiculous plot hole, and one of the worst plot holes I've ever seen, is the fact that every character that comes along and is told about this crazy story unfolding at their apartment complex just believes it, don't question it in anyway, and just go along with this silly fairytale as if they live in lala land and it's all perfectly normal. A really bad film with some funny lines and moments, but not worth wasting your time on in my opinion."
4,"Surprisingly good and enjoyable, but sound quality is occasional distraction","The directing and camera work are very good in this movie. The storyline is interesting: a modern day fairy tale. Occasionally the sound was so quiet that it was impossible to hear the actors -- this was a streaming movie, so I don't know how the DVD would be. Overall it was a very enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to others. Paul Giamatti is a tremendously talented actor and gives a superb performance."
5,"If you love fairy tales, watch this movie","I cried the whole way through. What a fantastic movie, can't believe I didn't watch it sooner. This is what fairy tales are about. If you want to be inspired, watch this movie."
5,GREAT STORY!,"M. Night does it again. I love the way he tells stories. There is no language, no sex, no inappropriate behavior, just a great story with great acting and characters. If you liked his other stories, you'll love this one.M. Night wrote this as a bedtime story for his daughters, but don't let that fool you. The suspense is great and the deeper meaning behind the story is worth so much."
5,INCREDIBLE MOVIE!!,"My 14 year old daughter and I went to see this film, with a bit of trepidation due to the poor reviews. After watching the movie, we understood why - it was marketed as a thriller, when in fact it is anything *but*. It is suspenseful, often edge-of-your-seat, but no gore. It is just a wonderful, enlightening and enjoyable movie ... and if you give it a chance, it will offer you a glimpse or two into the fragile nature of our human qualities. We both walked away with a strong sense of uplifted emotion! Warning: if you're seeking a horror film, this is not the movie for you! We both found that it's sad when a movie receives bad reviews because it failed to deliver sex, foul language and gore!!! This movie was GREAT without resorting to that ... no cheap scare tactics. If your expectations are reasonable, and you're not expecting to leave the theater scared to death, then you will truly enjoy this movie! And you may just walk away and find you have a pocket full of hope :-)"
4,A bedtime story for those who remember how to dream,"If you expect the thrills and chills of M. Night Shymalayan's earlier movies, you will not find it here. Instead this movie is a deeply thoughtful exploration of the human spirit through the bedtime story. No person is what they believe themselves to be. Instead, by reaching within they become something greater. One minor character, the critic, gives voice to the jaded American consciousness, disappointed when expectations are not met within a story, and disappointed when they are. The critic, like those he represents, believes he knows all there is to know, and is completely closed to that which is new and different. Story awakens the dreams of those she encounters. That is the lesson of this bedtime story..never forget how to dream. Never forget that each can be more than we are."
1,i wish i could,"get my money and my time back---all was wasted on this horrible movie!!!i think he needs to go back to having only CAMEO'S of himself in the movies he makes -- can you imagine, he would have destroyed the village, and the sixth sence if he decided to take on a major role!!"
1,Awful-Just Awful,"Just watched this movie. I know, I know--I am a bit behind in my movie watching--frankly I shouldn't have wasted my time. The idea/concept was good but the way it was presented was awful! I have enjoyed some of Shyamalan's work-""The Sixth Sense"" was excellent. I enjoyed ""The Village"" I even liked ""Signs"" but ""The Lady In The Water"" made no sense at all. It would seems Shyamalan has forgotten just what he is good at..btw he isn't good at acting-he's awful. He seems to have become so full of himself that he has lost his edge. I hope he gets his edge back as he has some talent."
2,Not worth blue ray,"Its quite a nice story, but the picture is not worth the money for a blu-ray disc. - Also the sound on my DVD is not exact synchronized with the picture!"
1,Blech!,"In my opinion, M. Night Shyamalan's movies have been on a steady decline since Sixth Sense. I didn't think it could get any worse after The Village, but he proved me wrong. This movie is PAINFUL. I don't know who this film was made for. It's a fairy tale to stupid and unbelievable for adults and too boring for kids. Bryce Dallas Howard's ""prince"" in this movie is the bald, fat, stuttering Paul Giamotti. Giamotti is a great actor, but he cannot carry a film as a lead. M. Night Shyamalan is known for having great twists at the end of his movies, but this one has no surprise ending which leaves the viewer wondering, ""What was the point of this movie?""As for the blu-ray, this is the most underwhelming picture I have yet to see on a blu-ray. The colors are drab and dirty. There is no ""pop"". The film is grainy, flat, and dull (it is a BD-25 encoded in MPEG-2. The audio is all over the place too. I had to constantly adjust the volume on my system so I could hear all of the whispering."
1,biggest waste of time and film ever,"All I can say is that Mr. Shamalamadingdong blew it with this movie. This was quite possibly the most boring film I have seen since Avatar:the bald headed airbender. Oh wait, that was a Shamalamadingdong flick too. Oh Jeez. You have lost your talent dude."
5,Pushes the Limits of the Imagination!,"I have a new favorite movie! If you grew up loving The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and movies like Legend, you will absolutely love Lady in the Water directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It's fantasy in an ordinary environment. The characters are all so unique, humorous, and lovable in their own way. Paul Giamatti won me over, he's an incredible actor! Bryce Dallas Howard is entrancing! It's so imaginative, creative, and unpredictable! Every camera shot is so beautiful. The movie is intertwined with suspense, fantasy, and humor. It's better than Signs because it pushes the limits of your imagination."
5,Just Believe.,"I hate cynics, and I hate cynicism. Nothing drives me crazier than people who can't seem to stomach a story without some sense of irony, and people who can't have a little simple faith. Until now, I wasn't sure Night Shyamalan had it in him to take a leap of faith and make a movie without a ridiculous twist ending (okay, Unbreakable's twist ending didn't betray the entire nature of the film like The Village, but I digress)..but this film shows that he can do just that.People hated this movie, I think, precisely because it frustrates expectations; because it shatters the box that viewers had put Shyamalan into prior to the film's release. He was 'the twist guy', the 'I see dead people' guy. This isn't that kind of movie. There's no twist here. There IS magic here, and dare I say--there's even truth here.I could watch this movie a million times. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan. I believe."
4,The most misunderstood movie,"This movie is flawed but charming, unrealistic yet touching. If you keep in mind that this is a fairy tale, I think most fantasy fans will like this movie. Disregard all the hate Shyamalan draws (unnecessarily), it's just a fantasy/fairy tale movie with some morals scattered around you'll probably enjoy it. I know I did, quite a bit."
4,M. Night WOW,"I like this movie, but for some it does take a while for the story to kick in. M. Night Shyamalan is a wonderful storyteller, and there are many characters in this story. A true fan will stick with it, and be well rewarded in the end. There is a WOW factor here!!!"
4,What a Twist!,"I own this on DVD and I really like the added extras but, you won't miss out if you only rent.The story takes unexpected twists and it's a pretty fun and creative story.Some of the characters were a little annoying but, hey 4 stars is still a good movie.Other than that, you will enjoy the movie."
2,Please end this movie. . .,". . .the actors do a fine job. The photography does not offend. The story (no pun intended) had some potential.I thought the movie would never end.In a nutshell, I would assume this is a like it or dislike it film (I can't imagine either love or hate for this.) My reason for disliking it is I could not empathize with most of the folks I thought I SHOULD empathize with. I found it, therefore, difficult to really care what happened next. There were some holes and incongruities in the story which could be overlooked, but required, in my case, that I KNOW I was overlooking them.For me, then, this story -- even though well ""packaged"" was too much work for too little reward.I gave it two stars because the acting was good, and the actors deserve to their due. The story, the story, approached a type of lameness that this director and these actors would be expected (usually) to avoid."
4,Don't Dream: It's Over?,"DON'T DREAMYou should have watched LADY IN THE WATER (LITW) instead. You know how we both complain about money then you MUST rent/buy/watch THE VILLAGE (TV) by the same writer/director/auteur M Night Shyamalan (his other films are UNBREAKABLE starring Bruce Willis, THE SIXTH SENSE & SIGNS starring Mel Gibson & Joaquin Phoenix). I plan to watch LITW again because it is so deep, complex, weird, funny, serious, eccentric & quirky. PLEASE ignore the bad reviews of LITW. Perhaps you should watch TV first to understand the themes Shyamalan delves & revels in. LITW is THE WEIRDEST search for meaning (strangest film ever I've watched wouldn't be far off the mark) in something beyond the secularity & rigours/rigidness of science, money, jobs or to put it bluntly: Western Society Inc Corp. If only idealistic KID fairy tales were taken more seriously & recanted/applied to some extent in the real ADULT world, we would have a better universe to exist in...IT'S OVER?"
1,Horrible!!!!,Worst movie I've watched in FOREVER! Total waste of my life. HD version only polished a turd.
1,Stupid,"This is an absolutely absurd movie, with a stupid storyline, bad characters, bad character development and a really dumb predictable ending. /yawn"
3,M. Night Shyamalan,"could have made this a bit more exciting and added a few more twists which is what I like about his movies. Instead it is just a movie. For a drama, the best parts were the funny ones!"
2,A fairy tale not well told,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the writing in ""Lady"" is inconsistent and contrived...which is unfortunate since the basic premise had merit: one character (the Lady) faces one set of demons to overcome while the protagonist (the doctor) has is own. But, the movie fell flat because of mediocre writing.This is also one of the cases where the soundtrack is better than the movie; rent the movie, buy the soundtrack. :)"
2,BAD POOL!,"this is the WORST of M nighti cant belive that this is one of his movies !!!!and the act was funny , all the actors was so bad actingsorry but that one is wrong;("
2,M. Night Shyamalan movies get worse as they are made,This was the fifth movie M. Night Shyamalan has made and yes it was bad. The storyline was so unrealistic and nonbelieveable. I wish M. Night Shyamalan would look at his older movies and start making them good again. This was a rip off to viewers cause they previews makes it 100 times better looking than it actually is. Please take about 3 years off before you release your next movie then it might be better.
1,This is a well thought out review,"I have many many points to illustrate to discuss my displeasure in this feature film.1. It is not goodIn not good I'm specifically speaking about the content, design, and follow through of the picture.2. It wasted my time.In the time I spent watching this movie I could have been doing any number of things. From Botany to small home repairs. I could EVEN have watched something good (which this was not)3. It had a big budget for no reason.The actors, stage crew, all the way down to the film stock used for this film could have been better served with any number of better projects (even romantic comedies)If pressed I'm certain I can find more things I disliked about this movie."
1,I'll never trust Amazon's reviewers again.,I honestly don't know how this waste of celluloid is fairing so well on Amazon's ratings. This was one of the most ridiculous stories ever told. M. Night Shyamalan clearly lost his mind if he thought the public would want to see this. Paul Giamatti must have lost a bet to Shyamalan to waste his time and talents on such an awful movie.
1,Dead in the Water,"This movie is so stupid! It wasnt scary at all, and frankly I din't care what happened. The plot was ridiculous. That Night would appear in his own film as 'savior of the world' is shameless and shows an unbelievable degree of arrogance. ITs sad to think this could have been a great movie-COULD HAVE, but wasnt. I would only recommend this movie to someone who finds children's cartoons intellectually challenging. The plot was stupid,jumbled and confusing.The characters were uninteresting stereotypes.The momentum of the film was so poorly handled that there were no scary moments, and the monsters were not scary. I mean, a monster made of grass? Evil monkeys? Come on!! My 12 year old nephew, and I really mean this, could have written a more satisfying story. Night, I suggest you get some input before making millions of dollars worth of retarded farce.I cannot believe all the five star reviews that this movie is getting!! What is wrong with you people?!!"
3,HORRIBLE,"FOR THOSE WHO GAVE SOME POETIC REVIEW FOR THIS FILM....I SAY THIS FILM IS HORRIBLE NOT BECAUSE I WASN'T ENTERTAINED, BUT RATHER BECAUSE EVERY 10 MINUTES YOU WOULD SEE THE BOOM MIC IN THE FRAME PLAIN AS DAY. HOW COULD M. NIGHT BE SOOOOOOOOOOO CARELESS. IT WAS SOMEWHAT DISTRACTING, BUT MORE SO PATHETIC AND I'VE LOST ALOT OF RESPECT FOR HIM OVER IT."
2,Too much gobbledygoo,"Kudos to Paul Giamatti for a heart-felt performance and to the monster-makers on the special effects team, but it was very hard to get through the glut of gobbledygoo in the story. I can usually get into fantasy, but there was so much detail in the story and too many unanswered questions that my head exploded. I really can't recommend this movie."
4,A Modern Fantasy Fairy Tale,"A good ""fairy tale"" movie. Most people expect a horror film, I myself did too at first, but that's not what this movie is. The film is a tale of hope, healing and destiny filled with good characters, very nice special effects and a couple of twists (though if your familiar with movies you'll see most of them from a mile away). Both Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard do great jobs in their roles, as do the supporting cast. My only problem was the pace of the film it should have moved a little faster for me but other then that I highly reccommend this movie.Family movie for older kids, some scenes may alittle too intense/scary for younger ones (under7 or 8)"
2,"Another, ""Glad I rented it!"" flick","This movie just plain sucks. Another, ""Glad I rented it!"". I can't return it to Blockbuster fast enough. I know this is not a helpful review but just wanted to vent! :-)"
1,really?,"This movie is a joke. The story line sounds like it fits on a napkin and was made up by improv people within 2mins. This movie makes no sense, none of it does. Things are horribly obvious, stupid, and badly put together. I dog dreams better movies than that. I was more than disappointed and frustrated with this movie. Total waste of time to watch this, because at the end you feel even dumber for sitting through it that long."
4,Slow but sure.,"""Lady in the Water"", starts out slow, due to having to build the story. The last half is excellent. If there was as much action in the first half, it would have been a 5 Star. This is fantasy and unless you like fairy tales or sci-fi, you probably won't enjoy this movie. I did like it because it gives hope to mankind. I watched the film at a friend's house and then came home and ordered a copy for me. Makes an excellent bedtime story."
3,Not unentertaining just a little self indulgent,"Can't say it is bad but I would have liked to experience the story too. All the long shocked looks, all the deep revelations and reflections that each character had made me feel as if I was just an unfortunate forgotten observer not to be apart of anything and left to guess.With the exception of Paul Giamatti performance near the end I felt that Shalaman relied too much on his own belief that we would just ""get it"". That is what happens when someone is successful and then heads look the other direction in the belief that ""he knows what he is doing""...he has good ideas but he needs a more collaborative team to make a all encompassing vision.I would have loved some underwater scenes, or to have a sound effect or two when she meets people for the first time so I can experience a little of what they were feeling."
5,"If this movie does not completely inspire you, you are an idiot.","What else can I say? Sixth Sense was bearable,the Village was not. Signs was the stupidest movie ever made. Lady in the Water was an emotional roller coaster that made even the harshest cynic in our family weep with sorrow and laugh till he cried, often transfering directly from one to the other. Paul Giamatti couldn't be better."
1,So much talent... where did it go?,"I find it hard to believe that a director with such an amazing past catalog of work could release such a poorly written film. Horrible plot holes, weak storyline, pathetic digital monsters... sigh...I think this director should spend LESS time in front of the camera as an... uh... actor (?) and more time doing what he does best, directing.The actors (other than the director posing as an actor) were superb however. This was the ONLY aspect that kept me from turning it off half way through.Terribly disappointing."
5,Loved it!,"Despite the bad hype around the film, I actually thoroughly enjoyed it! I thought it was clever and super humorous. Definitely worth a watch."
4,Great Fairytale,"agree with the other comments, it is a fairy tale and wonderfully filmed. A great envisioning of what a modern tale of other realms may be. Suspenseful, humorous. It is not the Sixth Sense, this is a different style of movie - closer to Super 8. This is a fantastic tale, slightly innocent."
2,Not Worth My Time,This film only gets two stars from me because Paul Giamatti is such a good actor; otherwise it was a waste of my time.
1,WASTE OF MONEY !!!!,"I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it was just horrible. I hope the Kid's book was better. Shyamalan's best work is The Sixth Sence by far and I am disappointed he has never been able to reach that level of film making and story telling since. I was really looking for great things from M. Night but not yet. I know he has it in him, maybe as he ages, like wine he will get better !William Brock"
1,WORST MOVIE EVER! M NIGHT IS THE WORST DIRECTOR!,I AM STARTING TO WONDER IF M NIGHT REALLY WROTE THE SIXTH SENSE BECAUSE THE REST OF HIS MOVIES ARE SO BAD I JUST DONT UNDERSTAND HOW THIS GUY GET MOVIE TO MAKE THIS JUNK AND THEN EXPECT PEOPLE TO ENJOY THE LADY IN THE WATER...WHAT THE HELL IS A NARF I AM STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THIS ONE OUT. BOTTOM LINE...SAVE YOUR MOVIE MONEY WAIT TILL IT COMES TO ON VIDEO OR DVD OR ON CABLE AND THEN WATCH HIS MOVIES. I HAVE TO SAY THAT M NIGHT WILL NEVER WIN BEST DIRECTOR DOING THIS JUNK...LADY IN THE WATER WAS SO BAD THAT EVEN THE PRODUCERS DIDNT KNOW WHAT THE HELL THIS MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. SO THANK GOD I DIDNT SEE THIS JUNK IN THE THEATER.I GAVE THIS MOVIE A F WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
5,Unforgettable Bedtime Story,"M. Night Shyamalan lifted me into a dream world filled with thrills and hope, yet grounded me with a bond to humanity. NOT predictable, Lady in the Water is a film above films, a truly 'realistic' fantasy to follow. Every character is finely developed, interesting and endearing. Comical moments, tear-jerking scenes and edge-of-your-seat suspense pulled me into this film. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. An invigorating cinematic experience. Well-worth the watch."
1,Lady in the Water,"There is no zero star, otherwise that's what I would have chosen, for this film. I think that Mr. M. has his public fooled. It's like the story of the emporer's new clothes. None of his fans will really tell him how bad most of his movies are. The onlyfilm I seen so far, and I have seen them all, is theone about the aliens terrifying a farm somewhere.And how does he get the big time stars into his films.They had better review the old fairy tales."
1,M's Last Chance,"After the critical and box office rejection of ""The Village"", this appeared to be M Night's last chance to redeem himself. After the failure of this film, it is doubtfull anyone will give him 50 million bucks and let him go play.The story commits the one sin a movie fan cannot forgive, it is boring. Forget about the fact that it is preposterous and makes no sense. I found myself straining to pay attention. Then silly jokes are thrown in. It was as if M was saying: ""Ha, I got your money, now you have to put up with this crap"".I will not see M's next film unless it is on every critic's top ten list."
1,this movie failed in my eyes for the following reasons...,"I don't want to spend too much time trashing this movie. That would do it too much justice. Most people will be like me, and go see this movie despite the bad reviews, only because it is by M Night Shaymalan. To be sure, his Sixth Sense was superb, and Signs was very good. But with Village, and now this farce, it is clear that SHaymalan has lost something - the magic, or inspiration, that made his movies special.The average viewer wanted a mysterious, suspensful and sophisticated horror movie. This is a fair assesment, since a) the studio pitched the movie this way thru trailers and commercials b) Shaymalan is known primarily for creating such movies. What he gives us instead is a muddled, aimless tale that fails to engage the viewer and leaves us disappointed. Shaymalan cannot hope to survive many more such failures in the cutthroat movie industry."
3,lady in the water,"I am a big fan of M's work but this movie seems to have its feet in everywhere. the plot is convoluted but strung out. M always brings a great story but to be honest-the movie is mesmerizing and confusing. it maybe a bedtime story but its too ridiculous for even alittle one to understand. I thought PAUL GIAMATTI was excellent along with BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD. The movie touches many emotional levels for several characters and is heartfelt. REDEMPTION, ONE'S FUTURE and HEALING. I really think this movie has too much of a good thing, which hinders the overall impact. you could say that simplifying the plot would get less confusion but more clarity. overall?, I liked it-but I expected more-or should I say less?--really only 2.5 stars"
2,didn't like this movie,"i bought this as a bargain movie, but i had never saw it. when i finally sat down to watch it, i fell asleep and woke up it was still on. it was long, boring and confusing unless i missed something that other people who gave this movie a good review."
1,Director needs to know better,"The director of this film was out of touch in refusing to work with other people on it.Every time I hear the word ""Narf"", I think of PINKY AND THE BRAIN. Kind of spoils whatever the director was aiming for."
4,A matter of personal taste,"What a strange and lovely film from M. Night Shyamalan. Sad, sweet, funny and frightening. A group of misfit residents in an apartment complex called The Cove find their destinies when their lives intersect with a water nymph named Story. Paul Giamatti will make you cry in a poignant performance as a man who has lost his family through violence and who finds a purpose in life that he could never have imagined. M. Night Shyamalan performs in the film and he is arresting. Highly recommended. The special effects are unbelievably good. A special, spiritual film. You will like it if you are into M. Night Shyamalan's films, otherwise, you may find it not to your taste."
2,Bad acting poor plot,I wanted to believe in the story but the acting and the plot were so poor I couldn't really get into the premise of this film. Too bad it had the makings of a good story at the beginning.
2,Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition),"Lady in the Water (Widescreen Edition) is a strange fantasy movie that centers around a handyman (Paul Giamatti) at Philadelphia apartment complex who discovers who discovers a naiad like creature named Story. The acting is not great and the storyline falters. The movie seems really long even though it only is 110 minutes, it seems much longer. It was universally panned by critics and was nominated for worst movie at the Razzie awards. It is not a 1 star movie but a since I can not give 1 and a half it gets a very weak 2. Not recommended. 2 out of 5."
3,"Worth Seeing, But Requires an Open Mind","This movie was not as dark as I expected it to be. Actually, it wasn't at all what I was expecting which comes as a pleasant surprise to me.Originally this was a bedtime story for his children, Shyamalan's surprisingly non-shocking tale poetically intertwines compassion, inter-connectedness, spiritual awakening, and destiny.We're reminded that as a child we understood those things instinctually, and on some level, we're all searching to return to that mystic place again whether we're consciously aware of this fact or not.Chris Cade[...]"
4,A Film Buff's Kind of Movie,"You will either really like this movie or really hate it. I really like it. There are some fairly brief scary parts which make some folks classify this as a horror picture. But, it is a fairy tale in the way of a Grimm's story where you are scared for a bit and then warmed by the goodness to be found in it. There is artistry to found in every corner of this film and connoisseurs must make time to take a look."
2,If you're expecting the 6th Sense you will be disappointed,"The 6th Sense was a brilliant film, Unbreakable and Signs were OK, Lady... is not even watchable. The dialogue is all exposition, it sounds like it was written by a first year film student. M. Night usually has a cameo in all his films ala Hitchcock. In this one he has a major part, a writer, a messianic figure who is doomed to die no less. A touch of ego? His stars try hard, and to give them credit they read their awful lines with as much heart as can be expected. Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor, but even he could not save this film. If you watch the ""making of"" feature, you are forced to think that they spent the entire budget on building a perfectly ordinary looking apartment building from scratch."
2,Can't really say it was a dissapointment....,"because I had low expectations after hearing so many bad reviews. I liked all on MNS's other movies, even The Village, so I thought I'd at least like this one, especially because I'm obsessed with fairy tales. But there are so many plot holes and areas where I can't really suspend belief: mostly how everyone in the apartment building gets together to believe in a highly dubious fairy tale. The acting is quite bad, especially from the Asian punky girl who tells Giametti the ""bedtime story"" when he wonders what's going on...her performance is so much of an Asian characture that I find it offensive. And does anyone notice that the ""Lady's"" hair changes from redhead to blonde during the film, sans explination (or perchance, intent)? Altogether, it was sloppily done. There's an interesting story in there, but unfortunately it wasn't told very well."
3,Not as good as Shyamalan's other work,"The Lady in the Water was quite a bit of a disappointment considering his other masterpieces (!) such as Signs, The Others, The Village, and Sixth Sense.The movie sheds light on an apartments' superintendent who comes across an unusual girl in the complex's swimming pool. Soon enough it becomes evident that there is more than meets the eye in regards to... both of them.The acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the plot is below average, while the dialogues/lines are way beyond ""below average,"" and then there's the great music!In short, The Lady in the Water is really nothing great. You might want to wait till they show it on TV. 2.5 Stars"
1,"picture colors unimpressive, problems with stuck between modes","I just went on vacation and took about 190 pics during all different lights and distances, used diff modes, and videos. I thought the camera and menus were easy enough to use, but the picture colors were just blah. Also I had 3 or 4 times in 2 days where the camera jammed with the lense open and zoomed out, but I had a black screen and it wouldn't turn on or off. I had to mess with it for quite a while and missed 5 to 10 minutes of pictures each time. I am returning it."
3,Battery Problems,"I purchased this camera in June 2007 and after one round of video and pictures on my 2G ScanDisk, I am having battery problems. It says the battery is full when I have just put a brand new set of Lithium or regular batteries. The camera is not that expensive, but still I would expect to use it for a few years without problems? Before this issue, the camera had been great."
3,User Friendly,"This camera is user friendly. I like the large display screen. I love all the different setting modes like theatre,etc. I like the red eye removal and the anit shake mode. The big problem is that it is only 3X optical zoom and isn't enough for taking pictures at a distance!! You need something with more mp for bigger zoom."
4,Fantastic camera for the money.,I've purchased over a dozen of these cameras for our field technicians. They are easy to use and take great photos. We have had issues with the battery cover integrity and displays that fail over time. Keep in mind these cameras are subject to quite a bit of abuse over their service life. I had one as a personal camera that was subject to a lot of shock. The display finally bit the dust but not after a couple of years of rough and tumble.
4,Great Price and Great quality,I bought these bows for my wedding favors and was tying them around a small flag stick. They came pre-cut which was a huge time saver and the print quality looked great. The only bad thing is there is no fudge room in tying the bows so it may take a few times to get it right. Overall I definitely recommend using these if you want custom ribbon. They're a lot more substantial looking with the organza than being just satin.
4,"Personalized ""get your fingers in shape"" ribbon","I like how these ribbons turned out, the print was not as crisp as I would have liked, but still feel the quality is worth four stars, especially considering the price. Now with that said, please be sure to read the description well.....I missed the part where the ribbon comes on a bolt and was a little surprised when I received them with 'assembly' required. I only had to put 40ct together so it wasn't too painstaking, however, if you plan to use these for a larger party make sure you have a team of little elves to help out. In the end, I really like how mine turned out and would definitely order them again for a future small event."
1,Club Music,"If you are looking for Middle Eastern music with a heavy club beat to it, then you may like this CD. If you are looking for bellydance music, forget about this one. This does not even fall in to the contemporary bellydance music category, strictly club music. Taste varies, but in my opinion, a lot of the music on this CD lost a lot of its beauty by trying to make it more palatable to Western ears not used to Middle Eastern music."
5,I'll be sad to see it go,I purchased this sander over five years ago. It performed exceptionally over the years and produces swirl free finishes. I never had a problem with it gouging material and always had a flat surface afterwards. The only two complaints that I have are: the backing of the hook n loop pad has deteriorated and crumbled off its mount ($25.00 replacement cost); and the plastic dust canister split in two though it appears dewalt provides a canvas dust collector now. When this sander (which is still going strong) needs to be replaced I will probably look to its newer version.
2,Not that good...,"I have had this sander for several yrs. now. When I first used it I thought it was better than the Porter-Cable and it was. This year I had alot of wood restoring to do. So I decided to look around to see if I could find something better in the sanding dept. You see prep and sanding is the longest part on projects such as these. Efficiency is what I'm after. I purchased the Ridgid 6 in. orbital. Variable speed/variable orbit, on and on. Hands down I got what I was looking for. Efficiency! If you think this dewalt is the ticket, you haven't shopped around!"
1,"They call this a ""book""?","If you know anything about the JFK assassination investigation, you won't get anything from this work. This is for the greatest part a compilation of quotes from official sources. esp. the second US investigation which conluded that the murder was probably the result of a conspiracy. Otherwise, there is nothing new here, not a theory, not a piece of evidence. One would do a lot better reading Jim Marrs' CROSSFIRE, for example, or Summers' book also entitled CONSPIRACY. Both those works are book in their own right, which leave this pathetic little thing in the dust."
5,Critical Insights & Common Sense,"To begin with, an author, particularly of a business-related book could not receive a better endorsement than from Warren Buffett. For the informed reader, that could suffice for a review.For those unfamiliar with Buffett, this book is a must read. Ace Greenberg is witty, humorous and on the money with each subject. Peter Drucker suggested that the most effective form of communication is the 1-page memo and Ace Greenberg shows uncanny mastery of that form of communication. Whether you work in a small or large organization, but particularly a large one, this book is must reading.Enjoy."
3,Interesting if you have the time,A close business acquaintance from New Zealand suggested this as a good read. I ordered it and have found it very interesting and humorous at times. It is certainly not a book you can read cover to cover. Pick it up and set it down occasionally.
4,Pithy sayings from a fertile imagination,"If you can weather a few cultural references that not be cheered in these days of political correctness, you will be treated to a book full of ""ACE"" Greenberg's exhortation to keep your eye on the ball. Mr. Greenberg makes his points to the ""troops"" by focusing on the smallest detail. In one case this is paperclips, and so it goes on from there. Several mythical characters live in Greenberg's memos, and so keep the reader's interest. All this is window dressing for the main point, cut costs, even in good times, and you will keep the wolves at bay when things get soft.An easy read, but worth the time."
2,In sum: Cut expenses,"Say 'cut expenses' over and over and you get the point of this common-sense book. Also, tie knots in your rubber bands. But lick only half of an envelope so someone else can reuse the envelope and lick the other half? And did I mention that you should cut expenses? How can firms pay those absurd mulit-million-dollar bonuses and expect everyone to adopt these draconian measures. Most of us have been doing what Mr. Greenberg suggests--and more--as a matter of survival in a day when jobs come and go. BTW, to one-up Mr. Greenberg, I'm suggesting my firm go to once-a-day toilet flushings beginning 1/02. We also asked employees to only use two tines on a fork at lunch and share the other two with a co-worker, but we saw an adverse effect on our health premiums."
4,Good,"Overall the item is good, the material is a little rough and the screen print is not as clear as it could be."
2,"Nice, but SHEDS!","This item is great feel-wise, but it constantly sheds its hair all over. I have used a lint roller multiple times, but it will not stop. You rub it against you, your clothing, or a pillow, and there is hair everywhere. Quite unfortunate."
2,Military chewing gum for the eyes.,"Not a bad read as long as you don't take it all too seriously. Far too much of it feels like fiction and I guess Keith Cory-Jones has got the gift of the gab for making Hollywod style plots. Plenty of authentic looking pictures and grim revelations about nasty stuff going on during the time. I think the former Janes staffer has it spot on - love the bit about the white tape. Sloppy stuff.I read this book a few years back, along with a bunch of other similar experiences from ex-SAS men cashing in on Andy McNabb's success with Bravo Two Zero. Much of these reports you can apparently take with a grain of salt and I think this novel you can throw in the same boat. Good chewing gum for the eyes on a journey from the airport, or what have you, if you don't like romantic fiction."
4,"Jumpstart Toddlers, Preschool and Pre-K","My 2 boys (ages 2,4) absolutely love the Jumpstart CDs. The older one has been using the Toddlers CD from age 2 - before he could use a mouse. While the keyborad can be used for most acitivites on the Toddler CD, the mouse introduction is fun and simple. There are activities appropriate to different ages and encourage independent play. I find that the kids enjoy being able to do it all themselves. These CDs keep my 2 rambunctious boys occupied for hours!!!"
2,Mac OS X Users - bad luck!,"Of the three CD set only the Fundamentals one runs on a Mac OS X. The other 2 will work only in Classic mode, so if you've upgraded to Tiger you are out of luck. Besides it seems this company is now defunct. jumpstart.com redirects you to Vivendi Universal which does not even list this product line on their site. Too bad that folks like Jumpstart and Reader Rabbit have stopped supporting Mac OS."
1,NOT THE OLDER VERSION AS SHOWN,I received the new version 2010 that requires internet access and very $$ membership once your child has completed a few levels. This is not the older version I thought I was ordering by the picture and description. Good chance this will be going back. Not much point in having CD's if you end up having to purchase membership online.
2,Excessive Introduction,"My 5 year old daughter was eager and happy to get this software for Christmas, but we have only had a few short sessions with it so far, 4 weeks later. Once you start the Fundamentals session, there is a several minute introduction...ok, we have seen it. Once you finally get to the actual activities, they are rather mundane. Also, I think my daughter would prefer people to anthropomorphic animals. We are reading Go Dog Go the last few nights and loving it (OK, animals, but at least the challenge of reading is there and somehow holds her interest). I think books are better than software."
4,Good book but would have been better if it was shorter,"My first impression of this book was that everyone has a story to tell but not everyone has a story I want to hear. Although the title of the book refers to the Voyani, the first third of the book has large sections about a butler, er domicis, and Jewel Terafin's `den'. It bothered me that MW has succumbed to Robert Jordan sequelitis and keeps introducing new characters and new storylines without actually ending the existing stories. As such, I was pretty disappointed. The beginning and middle really dragged on and on.But the last third of this book is fantastic. There are large flashback sections that explain the history of Arkosa and the story is GOOD. Very creative. Well told. For the last 200 pages, I could not stop reading. :)Due to the excellent ending, I will read the next book and I have a positive overall impression. However this book would have been much better if it had just told the Voyani tale from beginning to end."
4,"great book, made me cry","This was a very good book. It had that certain sadness to it of wanting someone you can't have. It dragged somewhat, but it picked up and had a great ending."
5,Simply the Finest of the Bruckner Romatic's,"There is very little to add to the previous reviewer. I remember getting this on Lp and being mystified at just how intent Klemperer is at the Bruckner thing. He never drags and moves things along, which somehow goes against everything people criticize in his conducting. The Philharmonia plays with great feeling and fervour. Wonderful woodwinds with Gareth MORRIS and Bernard Walton on clarinet. They just have the right tough of refinement for this epic music.Sadly there are few ensembles or orchestras today who could ever touch this in any way. Recently Tintner has done wonders in this repetoire but maybe without the last touch of personality we have here...this is Bruckner carved in granite."
4,Great mix of music.,"This is a pretty well put together compliation. The chill out cd kind of lacks, but it's nice that they included the genre. The House cd is definitely the best. Pretty much every track is good, it will have you coming back for more. The Trance cd is enjoyable too, but I've kind of lost my desire to hear a lot of trance these days. Again all the top picks for 2003 are here."
2,"Not for ""learners""","I was disappointed because this isn't a full-sized book (probably 5x7), and the practice lines are spaced too closely together for ""learning hands"". They provide only enough room to write most practice words once. Although it is written for ""Grade 2"", I would not recommend it for a 2nd grader or a learner at any grade. It could be used as a practice book for a more experienced writer. Honestly, it looks like they tried to save money by shrinking the practice space -- which doesn't work for a 'learn and practice handwriting' book! I am continuing to use the 'modern-style cursive' book I had hoped this book would replace."
4,handwriting practice book,I bought this book for my granddaughter who is struggling with all things related to learning anything important. She doesn't mind this book at all and will be doing a page a day all summer so she can hopefully get caught up and ready for 3rd grade.
3,A Little Longer Please...,"We bought this in conjunction with the Highland 10391 Kar Pak Waterproof Soft-Sided Car Top Carrier - 15 cubic feet and found it to be a little short. We ended up doubling-up a pair to meet the length requirements, and getting 2 more to really secure the Kar Pak to the car....but maybe we're overly cautious too."
3,okey product,"ratchet part was a little hard to use, mostly in the undo part. these were good for the limited use"
2,iTS ALL ABOUT THE rATCHET,"Purchased this four set 1"" X 10' ratchet to secure a Medical Powerchair to the trailer hitch auto carrier. The hardware on the ends is not what I required for my ergo needs. The ratchet required a release via opening the ratchet to 180 degrees. This is fairly standard to relesethe mechanism. However this hardware was very difficult to enter 180 degrees. Once at this opening the physical size of the hardware was not large enough to release the wrapped fabric.sent back to Ammazon."
2,cheaply made,Tried using these to hold down a motorcycle on a trailer......worked great until they got stressed out after about 15 minutes.......had to keep taking the up every few hours.......not really worth the money
1,Not worth it!,"If you are not a religious person, don't waste your time. Too much God and not enough healing."
2,Not that good,"This book doesn't have the answers nor the path to help you arrive at where the answers could be. There are few good parts in it which is why I gave it 2 stars. This book would make a good work book to take to therapy, something I am unfortunately not able to participate in."
4,"Real Hope, Help, and Healing","This was a real help for me to deal with my own eating disorder. I really had to push myself to keep reading it, but in the end, it really was worth it. It helped me not just see how bad my problem is, but also evaluate WHY it is has such a strong hold on me and my life.I'd definitely recommend this to anyone struggling with eating disorders."
2,hmmm.,"These stroies are worth reading,but the translations in this book are fairly bland. In fact, the translation for Ajax is pretty bad. I don't think I've ever seen the word twinkie used in a Greek trajedy before. I would recomend picking up other versions of these plays."
4,A little fluffy.,"This book is somewhat less terse and succint than other books I've read. I don't have tons of time to read so appreciate short books that get to the point. This book was a little thicker than it needed to be. I like it but ""Programming for the Java Virtual Machine"" by Engel and O'Reilly's ""Java Virtual Machine"" are somewhat better books and thinner. PFTJVM has some nice diagrams while JVM has some better explainations on things like exceptions. It might be best to check out these three and pick according to taste."
3,A bit disappointed,"This book is mostly a rehashing of the Java Virtual Machine Specification (which is available online from Sun, or in printed form). I found its reference section to be slightly less intuitively-organized than the JVM spec, and the rest of the book didn't really add a lot of new insight, beyond a semi-guided tour of the Java Class File format. I would've like a much more detailed tour of the really interesting JVM elements: locking/synchronization implementation, JITs, threads, and advanced garbage collection implementations. There's a lot of active research into JVM design, but not a drop of it can be found in here, sadly."
3,Useful - But No In Depth Coverage,"The book covers many abstract concepts, but it is hard to understand what something abstract means without a concrete example. Implementation of the heap, object layout, etc. is difficult to conceptualize without a real example. I would have been happy if this book discussed the VM as it does now with a running commentary on the Sun Win32 JVM implementation."
1,Good to decorate your shelves,"This book spends too much paper explaining the Java history and why it is a good programming language. It is very, very boring. The advanced stuff begins after chapter 3, but they are not well explained. Well, all I can say is I really regret having bought this book, and I do not recommend it to any expirienced and short-in-time Java programmer like me."
5,One of my Fav books,One of the best books I have ever read. Definitely changed my views on a lot of topics. Freire is great.
3,Too abstract,"Freire was a brilliant thinker, and his ideas about education and society are quite relevant; the main flaw with this book however, is one glaring contradiction--Freire seems to be completely ignoring his own proposal that ideas should be more accessible to the masses. The concepts and their explanations found within Pedagogy of the Oppressed, at least in its English translation, are worded so crypticly that one cannot simply read the book. One must thoroughly analyze every single explanation before the concepts can be grasped, and as far as I am concerned, anyone who argues the contrary is absolutely wrong. And while it is true that complex, abstract explanations are often needed to convey such esoteric ways of thinking, I believe that this book could have been made much more accessible to the masses. This is not for everyone. Although the subject interests me, the book simply wasn't an exciting read."
3,Pedagogy of the Oppressed,I haven't finished it yet. I hope to use it as a reference in my dissertation concept paper. Mentor recommended.
1,Jabberwocky,"Like the famous non-sense poem, the book feels like it ought to make sense, but it never does. As you read, you will have the feeling of impending meaning, and that in the next paragraph, or on the next page, or in the next chapter, everything will come together and you will have your moment of clarity. Never happens.Whatever you think Paulo Freire means, you are wrong."
2,"absurdist masterpiece, Dadaisms' belated but finest hour","This book definitely made a huge impression on me when I first attempted to grok it upon some hipsters recommendation. Now I consider myself a bit of a wordsmith and I enjoy heady, verbose literature even seeking out extreme examples(niche scientific journals((astro-physics, etc..)) just for the sheer entertainment value of perusing esoteric terminology. But this franken-book takes the cake uber alles. This book should come with a warning: !AVISO! FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY!, not the least of which should entail incredulous ridicule at the convulsions of lingual transfiguration signifying nothing which occur so profusely here. Paulo's chronic and protracted pscho-masturbatory transgressions against all speaking peoples should serve as a high-water mark for all writers seeking to crucify their intellects on the cross of academia. Beware of those who find this meaningful."
1,A truly pernicious book,"This is one of those books that is so bad you don't forget it, because it is so misguided and pernicious. Freire thoroughly misreads Hegel and doesn't much understand Marx. It astonishes me that it is still in print: it has the dated quality of a mid-1950s Soviet textbook on Marxism-Leninism and more than a whiff of the arrogance of the messianic monsters who end up as Communist dicators. And the translation is lousy."
1,"Anti-intellectual, poorly written tripe","This book is like some kind of Bible to hard-core Lefties, but I think they must never have actually opened it and read what was inside. Freire wrotes admiringly of Mao's Cultural Revolution and Castro's Cuba, and quotes Lenin as a brother-in-arms. His bottom line seems to be that a pseudo-intellectual ""revolutionary leader"" like himself is the only sort of person who truly ""understands"" the ""peasants"" and can guide them to higher consciousness. The book is almost laughably poorly written, and incredibly pretentious and it doesn't take a genius to realize that it reads like a tract by some self-adoring Latin American left-wing dictator (like Castro) justifying his own grasp on power. A dangerous book, if only because it flaunts its own deep ignorance and if it did fall into the hands of people who didn't know any better they might actually believe some of this garbage."
3,Dialogue of the Oppressor.,"Admittedly I am not the brightest bulb in the drawer; I am a teacher of what would be deemed the ""oppressed."" Though it isn't the weight or worth of a human, I have earned a Grad degree in Elem. & Spec. ed. while my wife is a veterinarian. I am currently reading this book and have I read a few paragraphs to aloud and my wife came up with the, ""dialogue of the oppressor"" saying.The verbiage seems intentionally obtuse, each paragraph could be rewritten in more palatable language and thus far my English copy cites paragraphs in both Spanish and French.This is all fine and well were the subject matter not so ironic. I paraphrased an excerpt for a parent of one of my students (low income, minority neighborhood) and she was at odds to make sense of any of it.The content is invaluable and though much of the book is obvious Freire places much light and forethought into his concepts.Still the way it is delivered is like having directions to Panacea-ville written in Ugaritic."
4,Reconstructing Gender - a multicultural anthology - fifth edition - Author Estelle Disch,"Used from the Miami University Bookstore; saved me money from buying new, approximately $30! Book is in good condition for being used, however some of the book is underlined in pencil. I am very satisfied with this book."
1,Not all bad but not at all good,"This book seems to have been written by someone who did not want to be understood. He made some interesting points but at most times the structure and wording were incomprehensible. It is ironic that he talks about connecting with people in language they understand yet his writing is very inaccessible. I also thought he was a bit hypocritical in that he defends or overlooks the excesses and abuses of ""revolutionaries"". I guess in his view bad behavior is justified if it is in pursuit of an agenda that agrees with the his political views."
3,"Competant, but too flat","I have a few difficulties with this release. It's similar to his other albums, so the music sounds rote. Even though Tower Of Power is brought in to mix things up (to good effect on ""Squib Cakes""), ultimately it doesn't help enough. I'm not a big fan of the vocal tracks, the singing is too open-mic blues night-y. Hugh Masekela's singing on ""Ha Lese Le Di Khanna"" is an exception, though he sounds lost on ""Child Of The Earth"". It's possible I may have just reached my Poncho Sanchez CD limit, and someone less familiar with his music might like it more."
5,Quilting a Year of Pot Holders,"I 'm a beginner at quilting, I totally love this book. As a beginner I find it easy to under stand and to use, Yet for me as a beginner a bit challenging.I love to challenge myself month by month it is like BOM but instead it is pot holders.Fun Fun Fun"
1,Odious.,I couldn't wait to get the smell off of me. Smells like a low-cost feminine hygiene product.
4,So Nice I bought it Twice,"I purchased one of these for myself, and a second one for my father. I had some concern that it might be too heavy and clunky to haul around, but it turned out to be surprisingly light. I carry mine when out relic hunting. It is great for poking and prodding at things, and surprisingly effective for shooing pesky children back to their parents, or pesky dogs back to their owners. Every curmudgeon should have one of these. Great tool."
3,Shoulder strap problems,"Shoulder strap was flimsy and began to tear after 2 uses. Otherwise, it's a great bag."
4,Epically awesome,I bought it because my favorite hottie photographer is in it. He plays AKO... Was a lot of fun watching him on camera.
5,Great Product,I used these staples to complete my latest flooring job and they just performed perfectly.......They were outstanding for the pice that was paid
2,Pricey,"These worked fine in my Central Pneumatic floor nailer, but they're expensive (same box $67.00 at Lowes or Home Depot).But the best deal I've found is the Central Pneumatic brand at Harbor Feight: $3.99/500, and I only needed about 1,000 to finish up my remodeling job - not 7,720-take-it-or-leave-it!"
5,Classic Rammstein!,"Rammstein Live aus Berlin is amazing. If your a Rammstein fan this is a must own. Early days of Rammstein power and performance displayed in this DVD, great choice. Wont disappoint any true fan."
1,Boring...,"I bought this book for an American Lit class, and thought the book was really confusing and a bit dull.. but then again, American Lit is not really my favorite subject!"
5,a character driven suspense novel,"If you like suspense novels populated by shallow, wise-cracking protagonists, where the plot is everything, stay away from this novel and series.If you like to care about what goes on in the lives of your lead characters, to find out what makes them tick, while at the same time enjoying a well written, fast moving who-dun-it and why, start reading the Alan Banks series, starting with Gallows View."
2,Not as good as the other Inspector Banks books,The story of this book does not hold up to the suspense of the rest of the series. I could not finish this book as the story simply wasn't interesting enough. The dialogue bits 'policeman vs psychologist' are simply ridiculous.
5,A Great Recommendation,A dear friend finding out that I loved mysteries gave me this book to read. As I read it I wondered why I was enjoying it so much. I love mysteries especially when there is an intriguing hero. Inspector Banks is a normal individual. He works hard and is devoted to his job. There is not much mystery in this book but I could not put it down.In short it was a wonderful read.
4,A classic in the making,"Having read and enjoyed thoroughly Robinson's series beginning with In a Dry Season, I was eager to begin with the first in the series and to gain an understanding of Inspector Alan Banks. This book did just that. His character and those around him are fully fleshed out and the story is a good solid mystery with lots of twists and turns. It really kept me guessing from the first incident of the peeping tom to the conclusion.Some police precedurals can be dry and uninteresting, but that is not the case with Robinson's Banks series. He doesn't disapppoint."
2,Kind of silly and definitely dated,"I'm always looking for good mystery stories, and bought this first book in the Inspector Banks series thinking it sounded promising. Sorry to say, I found the dialog stilted, the interactions of the characters not realistic or adult, and the women's lib angle poorly expressed. If it werent for the violence and sex, it'd be a better read for someone in junior high school. The professional characters, like the chief inspector and the psychologist, seem awfully inexperienced for people in those kinds of jobs. Part of the reason it seems corny is that it doesnt stand up well after 20 years."
3,Blah,"For $20 I thought this would be something a bit more. The ""adventure"" is a bit boring and doesn't change much each time you play it. The navigation is quite poor compared to other games. Plus there's quite a bit of stutter on some of the vocals (I run a fairly fast machine with 768MB of RAM so I know it's not that). All in all, three stars may be a bit much, but my daughter likes it and I guess that's all that counts."
2,Slow Horses+Easy Puzzles= BORING!,"Well, what can I say? You're supposed to be racing through a canyon against this girl when your horse can't go faster than a canter.I ride, and compared to a gallop, cantering is way slower than galloping. And the ""challenges"" are too easy. They are all basically the same. You have to do a thing where there are bags or objects that you can only delete if there are 2 or more side-by-side. And it always ends the same. There is a different criminal, but the horse is always in the same place. My little sister figured the game out by herself, and she is only 6! This is a very easy game, that looses your attention easily."
3,Not that great,"I have two daughters 4 & 6 that did not enjoy this game very much. They found it difficult to move around in certain scenes, was not very user friendly, and did not come with enough instruction on what you can and cannot do in each scene sequence. They tried playing with it 2-3 times and lost thier enthusiasm."
2,Honestly...,"Its not the greatest game if your 9 or older. I finished it in about an hour!! Its completely unrealistic to real riding for the older kids but for the little kids, they might like it. For example, you have to go fast to jump a fence, that's so not true (even though I only have a year's riding experience) I have jumped a pole at a trot about 6 inches off the ground."
1,Don't waste money.,"Let me start off saying this game is too easy! I was 9 or 8 years old when I got it........ but the part I remember most was that I finished this game in and hour! I'M SERIOUS! This game will be challenging and fun for the very young mind. I suggest you get this game if your under 8. Another thing is that all the barbie horse games are the same........you go on trails, jump your horse, unlock levels, blah blah blah. If you do get a barbie horse game I would get the one for playstation...though that one isn't fully satisfying either."
5,Critters,"Rockstar ROCKS!G.Glass knows how to capture each and every one of the charactures in her books. Absolutly should be a movie (Along with Spitfire). Her writing style is the best and allows you to envision the charactures, the emotion and scenery which is what many writters attempt, but do are not able to achieve. Highly recomended to all!!!!!!! (Along with Spitfire)"
4,Kindle Version?,"I love the History of Middle Earth books. They are a bit academic, but truly a great way to explore Tolkien's work. When will an e-book be available?"
5,works like black magic,My Wii was having some really bad crackling noises when playing games. Zelda games were the worst for this. I read some words online and these little puppies right here seemed to be the answer. So I bought these off Amazon and they did exactly what I was hoping they would do. They took out all the crackling noises. God doesn't love you.
3,Does what it says,I won a hi-def radio receiver but the outputs were about 10dB too hot. These attenuators made the receiver usable with the consumer level inputs on my amplifier. I wish it was a -10dB though ... that would be more useful.
1,Bootleg or Foreign Disc,I did some research and was told this hasn't been released onto DVD so anything out there must be a bootleg or foreign disc. Beware!
5,My all time favorite book now!,"I purchased this book to plan for our vacation in France this summer. I love to collect books about France and ""French Country Hideaways"" is now my all time favorite. Casey O'Brien Blondes invites you to join her on a journey across France, to some of most charming towns and the families that welcome you into their homes and into their world. If I could have written a book about France, it would have been this one! Merci Casey :-) PS - Looking forward to more!"
5,Favorite Childhood Poetry Book,"I absolutely loved this book as a child, in fact I still do! I can't wait to share it with my daughter, especially the poem ""Boing! Boing! Squeak!""."
4,"Loved it as a kid, still love it now.","I had to buy this for my niece after I found myself starting a poem from the book and not remembering how to finish it. Imagine that - it's been at least 16 years since I had this book, yet I could still recite stanzas at will. How frustrating it was not to have all of them!Jack Prelutsky is one of the best children's poets out there. You MUST have this book - indoctrinate your kid in the joys of reading poetry aloud when they're young, and you'll never have to unteach them ""poetry is boring"" when they're older."
4,A Classic Then and Now,"Funny, relevant poems with great word choice and super kid appeal. This may be the rare volume that only gets better with time."
5,VERY GREAT book to get for Kids!!!!,"When I was a kid we read this book in my third grade class. We all had to pick a poem and recite it when we visited a nearby nursing home. The poem I had then was Gusses Greasy Spoon. It was my favorite then and still is! If you have kids or nieces or nephews get them this book, it's GREAT!!!!!"
5,Pride and Prejudice The book on DVD,This is great if you don't want to read the book and really want to know what the Author wrote and can't seem to get enough of the story. I really love this story and enjoy any version.
4,bay area under-rated treasure,"Roy Tyler sings on two cds by Gospel Hummingbirds. This is his solo cd debut. The disc is produced by Jimmy Pugh, from Robert Cray's band. One track is produced by Raphael Saadiq of Tone Tone Toni, whom Roy has known for years. Another track features another old friend Clarence Fountain of Blind Boys. Roy is originally from rural Louisiana but has been based in Oakland for many years. He is also influenced by O.V.Wright. It's a very strong cd, sadly obscure."
3,Too much bass,"I bought this Bauhaus recording, Instant Live: Riviera Theatre - Chicago, IL, 11/8/05, when Tower Records closed their stores. Bauhaus themselves sound good, but there is far too much bass in the mix. The bass is so overpowering in the mix that it is annoying. I threw a bass reducer equalizer preset in iTunes on it to make the vocals and guitar stand out better. Bauhaus sound fantastic - tight and energetic. Maybe the other nights from this tour are mixed better? I know some of the nights don't have In Fear of Fear or Bela Lugosi's Dead, so be careful which night you buy. This particular night, 11/8/05, is worth buying for serious Bauhaus fans. Maybe this can be remixed and re-released? I'd like to hear some of the other nights for comparison."
4,Works great!,"I am a mobile groomer and my cordless one kept loosing its charge since I have to turn off and on the power of the van as I work. I finally gave in and got this grinder and WOW! I was afraid I'd grind off the dogs foot it was so powerful! However, it really only works at the highest speed. Any lower and the motor just stops as soon as it hits the nail, even on smaller dogs. The highest speed however grinds the nails down quick and fast, even the big guys like Danes and Mastiffs."
5,one of the best,A huge improvement over re-chargeable models. I suggest using the grinding stone and leave plugged in to a light emitting diode on off switch.
4,Does the job well,"I was worried my dogs would be afraid of a grinder, but they didn't mind this one at all. It's pretty quiet. The only down side of this product is that you have to use it on a pretty high setting or it will stop. It doesn't matter what attachment you use you have to use it on a high setting. Other than that it works great."
5,Much better than any battery product,This serves an excellent purpose for use on our feisty little dog . Our dog is very calm as this does its job filing. This makes us all happy.
3,just a tad better than PediPaws,"I bought this because it was corded. As other reviewers say - the cordless ones quit after about 2 dogs and need recharging (although I love their power). This one, however, quits immediately upon putting any pressure at all on the nail. You have to basically rub the nail off as if you were using sandpaper! or a nail file. Have not yet tried it full-out. Maybe that's the key, although not working on variable speeds sort of negates the variable speed ability, don't you think? I wish I'd read all the reviews before I got it. It is, however, very comfortable to hold and lightweight."
2,Good while it lasted,"I thought this product worked quite well, until it died about 6 months after I bought it. A real shame when the motor dies out in a matter of months, when it was probably only used about 10-15 times, not on high speeds. Can't they make better quality products than this? It's not rocket science..."
4,Make sure you have a dehydrator,"A worthy book; however, a careful reading reveals that many of its recipes require the cook to ""dry [various ingredients] in your dehydrator."" This should not be a surprise to anyone who hits the trail often, but don't spend money on this book unless you have a dehydrator and are reasonably adept at operating it."
2,Not that useful and perhaps not that lightweight,"I am in charge of packing the food for my sister and I each Spring and Fall for ten days in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. I started drying our own food after the first trip (up to 15 now).I bought this book because, face it, after awhile you want something/anything different to eat. But my major concerns are weight, nutrition, and taste. I found many recipes contained WAY too much sodium and some just seemed ridiculous. I think we could all figure out that we could buy black bean mix and slap it on a tortilla or put a piece of cheese on a Triscuit. Maybe less time could have been spent on cute names and more time on food that didn't involve purchased mixes and ramen noodles.There are much better books out there, so shop around."
2,Dehydrators,"I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers. This book is devoted to dehydration techniques and may be life changing in that respect. If that is what you want, go for it. If you don't plan on using a dehydrator, you won't find much to use in this book."
2,Good for a laugh but not for hiking.....,We took this book with us on a hiking trip and got more laughs than ideas for meals. Yellow worms and cheese on crackers give me a break! This book is a total waste of time and cost. If your looking for meal ideas go elsewhere it's not here. The best thing to do with this book is use it to fuel a fire. Once the humor wore off the book is trash.........I feel ripped off......
3,Hardy but Heavy,"Some very good suggestions and recipes, but for an ultralight hiker without a frying pan many items are not adaptable."
3,recipes,The recipes in the book are ok. Based on the title I expected more savory tasting recipes. These recipes do require a lot of pre-trip prep.
2,Maggie's Gone.,"This book was not one of the best books I read from DOTM series. It was boring as hell in the begining,got interesting in the middle,and leaves you confused in the end, because they don't tell you who takes maggies place. but I have to agree that it totally explains what it takes to be comitted to the moon goddess Selene and how Penelope first meet Chris keeper of the secret scroll and hector, her lover. the books ok."
3,THE PROPHECY CANT WAIT,i havent finished the book yet but it is going really slow. Does it get better? Im 90 pages into it and it hasn't got all that interesting. Im going to finish it because i love all the other books. And one of the reviews said that if you are into greek mythology then this will be interesting. I love greek mythology so i am looking forward to reading this one. Besides asking if it get better i have to ask when #11 is coming out i couldnt find it anywhere and i really want to find out when. If you know will you create a review so i can read it.
2,Worst one of the series,This book was BORING!! It truly was the worst one of the series. It tells you how Penolope(Maggie's real name) became the mentor of the Daughters of the Moon. I would not recommend it to anyone. It was Horrible.
3,Daughters of the Moon the Talisman,"Okay, i am a fan of this series. i love these books, but i dont like this one to much. It gets kinda boring when they talk about Maggies past. I was hoping that this book would tell you more about Vanessa,Jimena,Serena, and Catty, but it didnt. Dont get me wrong I thought this was a good book, but not as good as the others."
1,In spite of proper prep; the mirror fell off!,"Well, I have convex mirrors on all of our cars (4 cars - 8 mirrors) so I know how to put these on. This is the first brand that has fallen off. Need I say anymore."
5,The best money you will ever spend.,"This ensemble plays both with precision and bravura. It successfully exploits the rich sonorities and full color pallate of the brass band through performances of a good, representative sample of the genre. The recording quality is quite good. I highly recommend the recording."
3,Cancelled order- slow transaction,Really liked the look but these random sellers can take a long time. We get spoiled by fast shipping. I cancelled the order. Sellers have to ship quickly befor buyer's remorse can set in...
3,"Lots of detail, hampered by poor editing","The authors know their stuff, and they stuff a lot into this book. I found the book difficult to read and use, though, because it is so poorly edited. The most glaring example is that two entire sections of Ch. 7 are hidden out of the table of contents because their heading levels are mis-assigned. That's almost 60 pages, and it is the crucial sections describing Microsoft's and Novell's migration tools. As a technical communicator (-slash-novice network administrator), I consider that a shameful, crippling flaw. The book is also scantily indexed, increasing the difficulty at finding content.Villeneuve focuses in great detail on low-level network protocols. That's great for helping you understand what's happening, and for debugging problems, but it makes for boring reading sometimes."
3,disappointing,"Although there are many fishes accounted for, it has quite a few that are missing, and it would be helpful if more showed pictures of the difference between adult and juveniles."
5,Great information,Love reading the national audubon society field guides for everything. I love nature and just love picking a field guide book of anything and will read for hours! It has great pictures and great information on each species. This is just another fantastic book by audubon!
1,This Cd stunk,This was not tha best the people could do. I hated it. I sold tha @!*# thing. Dont get it. It stunk.
5,"Finally, good coffee at home.",I have been looking for a good coffeemaker for a long time. This one does everything I want.
1,KITCHEN AID COFFE MAKER,I RECEIVED A DEFECTIVE COFFEE MAKER. I OWNED THE COFFEE MAKER FOR 2 DAYS AND THE BUTTONS ON THE TIMER FELL INTO THE COFFEE MAKER. KITCHEN AID WOULD NOT REPLACE IT FREE OF SERVICE. I HAD TO PAY SHIPPING TO SEND THE DEFECTIVE COFFEMAKER BACK. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN KITCHEN AID'S SERIVICE. SHIPPING SHOULD OF BEEN PAID FOR ON A $100.00 COFFEE MAKER. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING MADE BY KITCHEN AID. SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE.
1,Yuk! Pooey!,Brew temp too low to get proper coffee extraction. Taste is hardly tolerable and you must reheat 6oz cup in microwave after a few drinks. My old Melitta made 10 times better coffee and hot. This lousy thing will get returned.
1,Poor design = poor coffee,"I purchased this product after my old pot finally died, opting for a modern design for a new kitchen. While the design is nice, the coffee is terrible. Operation is fairly simple, but the rate at which the pot boils the water into the filter means you cannot run a very fine grind or the filter will overflow.Speaking of overflow - the designers built significant drainage on the bottom of the unit and I suspect they knew that there was less than 1/8"" difference between the pot being seated for brew and not engaging the drain. The difference means that any excess water in the filter runs down the opening mechanism and on to the hot plate. I take extra care to make sure I seat the pot before each use and still run a 50% chance I will have overflow.Very poor design, very poor tasting coffee, horrible design, many clean-ups. Do not buy."
2,Style without substance,"I received this model as a replacement because my previous coffee maker was recalled. Other than matching my other Kitchen Aid appliances, I don't have much good to say about this model.Cons (in order of importance):1) This brews coffee that lacks flavor and strength, regardless of bean quality or quantity.2) If the carafe isn't perfectly placed, I end up with a pool of coffee on the counter.3) Programming the clock and timer is tricky because the hour and minute buttons are cheap. You often have to hit the minute button several times for it to add one single minute to the clock.All things considered, this coffee maker is not worth the selling price. Even if you're into having all appliances match, avoid this machine, it will just occupy space on your counter and will NOT get used. A coffee machine has one primary function and this model fails to deliver."
1,"Totally bad - leaks, hard to clean, big and awkward","I have always like Kitchen Aid products, but this clunker coffee pot is from the dark ages. It does not have a stop/pour feature, really something easy to have (so coffee drips all over unless every last drop has been brewed) the timer/programmable strength feature is bogus and silly; it is huge and takes up much more room than my old Melitta grind and brew (and does not grind either) and it is impossible to clean properly. It collects all this water moisture and does not dry out easily; I am sure soon it will be mildewed inside. Good riddance."
4,This is a hot one!,"I love red, and I love Kitchenaid, so buying this was a no-brainer. I upgraded from a Mr. Coffee (also red). Here are the differences I've noticed: The coffee stays very warm in the Kitchenaid and I love the timer on the front that indicates the length of time its been sitting. That's great on lazy Saturdays when you wonder how long the coffee has been sitting. I also love the easy clean buttons and the easy programming.The front & side water pour area is okay with me, though not that convenient condsidering the height of my cabinets. I have to pull the coffemaker forward so that the top can stay up (Kitchenaid engineers, are you listening?) while filling. Thoughtful touches are everywhere as with all Kitchenaid products.One word of caution-coffemakers I've had in the past haven't been as persnickety about the ""fill to"" line, THIS ONE IS. Overfill and you WILL have a mess (but hey, they told you so!). All in all, great look and KA quality."
1,design without function,"I have several other KitchenAid appliances, and love them all.This was a valentines day present that I have been suffering in silence with for ~ 2 months now.Why I would take this thing back in an instant if it wasnt a very thoughtful gift:It has spilled all over my counter atleast 4 times - I have cleaned it carefully .. but yet it continuesWhen you push the carafe all the way in it pushes the filter assembly up - not a nice fitThe coffee is not hot enoughIt does look nice - but design only goes so farHonestly: I think I may not buy another KitchenAid product after this experience.Go pick up a $20 bodum and you will have FAR superior results."
1,8 cups of coffee-flavored water,"You can't make 10 cups without the grounds overflowing into the coffee. 8 cups is the max, unless you like weak coffee and use very few grounds. It is the messiest coffee pot I've ever owned, with coffee leaking all over the counter. Wonderful to wake up to at 4:00 am!"
1,KitchenAid could have done better,I purchased this coffee pot some time ago. It lasted only a few weeks prior to it beginning to leak when brewing. I gave up on it and gave it away. Beautiful - but not functional.
2,Poor effort,"I loved Yayoi's exhibition and bought the DVD to find out more about her and her work. I watched it together with my husband but both found the DVD very boring. Sometimes the subtitles just stop in a sentence or only start well into the conversation which is a bit annoying. Also some scenes go on for too long where not much is happening. I watched the whole DVD but don't find I've learned much about her past, her creative process or work she's done throughout her live. We're quite disappointed with the DVD."
2,One Song...,"Prince's backing couldn't save it. An Ian Broudie contribution couldn't save it.A sad ending for one of the greatest retro/60's pop bands ever. Sixteen Tambourines this ain't.HOWEVER, it is worth owning for the fantastic (and only classic track on the record in my opinion) Times Going Slower. This song is an essential in the Three O'clock catalog! Too bad it's surrounded by such mediocrity.Through the Sleepy Town is ok as well. But just ok."
2,Still looking for a good book on server controls...,"At the time of writing this review, I could only find 2 books dedicated to the subect of ASP.NET Server Controls (the WROX book being the other one). I purchased the Microsoft Press one and have found it to be a very complex read. So far I've painstakinly made it through 430 pages. The book is loaded with examples, but for any significant examples provided I've found myself flipping back (or forward) through the pages in order to find usually limited explainations as well as constantly going out to the .NET Framework SDK Documentation in order to figure out what is going on. You will learn things from this book, but I found it to be extremely slow going- not what I had hoped for."
1,One of the worst technical books I've encountered,It may be a nice reference but in no way it is a good explanation of how to get things done! The authors wrote the book without thinking of what readers might want to see.This is technical writing not a tutorial. I've read great tech books (like .NET Framework by Jeff Richter) where one doesn't have to read a paragraph twice. This book is not one of those.It is also very difficult to trace how things are related to each other and where they come from.
2,Book is good but need another book also,"Book is good but need another book alsoat the beginning level. I find this booksmore dificult to go through than the wrox booksbut there is very books that cover this areaExamples for chapter 13-14 don't work.I would prefer if the examples were more simpleand explained better.I will finish this book soon, but I do know thatI will need to get another book on server controlwith better explanations to fully understand thistechnology."
1,No details about the book????,I was interested in buying this book. But couldn't find any useful information about it such as Table of Contents. It doesn't even tell whether the book is written in C# or VB.So I decided I don't want to take the trouble of ordering and then return if it is not what I was looking for.
4,IT HAS A FINE PRACTICAL APPROACH,"With its practical approach to issues, this well-written book exposed the intricacies of ASP .NET Components. It shows its reader how to take the full advantages of .NET Server Controls and Components without wasting any time on unnecessary formalities. Every topic is laid out in a simple step-by-step method. If you can afford the time required to go through its contents once, you would come to realize what you have been missing.The only blame any impatient learner may lay on this book is that it takes its time in explaining an otherwise simple term. But, that is just how it cares for beginners who may not do without some initial breast-feeding."
5,Outstanding reference,"I found the book to be the absolute best reference on developing server controls. The book is written in a bit text-book language which makes it somewhat ""dry"". If your are familiar with Microsoft's .NET buzz words you'll be able to follow the book just fine.This is definitely not a beginner-level book. You have to have pretty good knowledge of C# and ASP.NET.Overall, 5 stars for excellent coverage of the topic. I just wish the book had more real-life examples."
3,Get ready to work,"This book may be a ""must have"", but only because of the lack of good books on ASP.NET control programming. It is not bad, but it is far from great. The book does go into a fine amount of detail concerning the ""behind the scenes"" functionality of controls - a must for serious control development - but often does a poor job explaining those details. It does a good job of ""showing"" code, but not so great a job at ""teaching"" code. Many explanations can be inconsistent, unclear, dense, and frustrating...it's often left to you to really determine why and how the code works by backtracking through the book, using MSDN documentation, or looking items up in another book.Control coverage is good - if explanations had been presented a bit more clearly and consistently, the book would be great."
5,Awesome...Great book,"This is ""THE"" book on server controls. The contents are very clear and the concepts are nicely explained.Anyone who wants to develop the server controls must buy this book. I had read book on the same topic from Wrox, but this book overshadows the Wrox book.The best part is that author gradually takes us from building a simple control to very complex one. In the process, he explains all the concepts. Reading this book was like taking an inside tour of the server controls.However I think that the companion CD would have been a bonus."
3,OK,"this game is fun the first time you play it. the second time you play it gets boring because you do the same thing. if you like this kind of thing buy the game, but don't get your hopes up too high."
4,"harmless , girly fun","I actually got this game used, and it is my [...] favorite, by far. I cannot honestly say it is educational, but it does incorporate some basic math (earning money for tasks, knowing if you have enough left to spend, etc.) and a lot of critical thinking ( you must meet certain criteria when decorating the window and designing outfits). This game would be a great choice for a [...] who enjoys fashion, a My Scene fan or not. I actually enjoyed designing outfits and tooling around on the subway as much as my daughter did."
1,BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,all of the games you do on the CD-rom is the same things you do on the my scene website.
2,um......................,"i like this game. it it is not corny or cheesy.but sill look at the chart:good things:shop duhhput on makeuplots of storesthe zine(it is the best part!)bad things:you can't buy shoesthey walk showyou can't chose anythingthe jobs are borrrring!that is all.over and out,kia.ps.at least it is better than Bratz(they are brats.)"
3,Only good if you know nothing about software,I don't think you could be very successful running a computer business if you need this book. Its way too basic.
1,Not what I aspected,This book is about how to organizes your software buisness. It was written ten years ago and anyone with seek technical advice in software development;I strongly do not buy it
2,hau kola the plains indian collection haffenreffer museum,I like to purchase books that are full of color plates. Like most indian art books there is interesting information but for the price that many of the Hau Kola books are being sold for it is definately worth the money unless you can get it for less than 30.00.
2,Much smaller than expected,There is nothing inherently wrong with this product. It is just MUCH smaller than the picture looks. It can't hold a standard size piece of paper (not wide enough). All of the mail in the picture must be greeting card size or smaller. We were simply looking for something larger. I feel it was expensive for the size.
4,Adorable,"This item is exactly as described, works great. Not that deep, but that is actually a good thing b/c it makes me have to sift through my mail sooner."
5,Exactly what I needed,"Sturdy, simple, stylish, functional. 5 key hooks and 3 envelope slots for all my mail and bills etc... Comes with the mounting hardware and has 4 holes to drill into and attach to dry wall or studs. If you put this on other surfaces you will have to use some other hardware for the specific surface like brick. I only used 2 of the holes on the top and that was plenty for keys and mail. I like the size and design. Big enough to do the job and small enough to tuck into a tight space on the wall if you need it to. Quick shipping as usual provided by Amazon. My friend liked it so much that he got one too. Gets all that junk mail off the desk!"
4,Just what I wanted,"This is just what I needed to help keep my kitchen table clear, three slots and not a bulky design. Definatly a good buy."
5,Useful and Great looking,"I bought this to organize our mail. The size is perfect. It looks great on our wall and is really well made. I love organization and this really fit the bill. I put our outgoing mail in the bottom rack, pending bills in middle and mail to open- in the Top. It can hold large mail, which is great. We have several sets of keys which now hang nicely on the rack instead of always lying around on the desk. Our mail and keys now have a nice home."
3,IT IS SMALL...,"WELL... IF YOU WANT TO BUY IT... TRY THINKING MORE... THIS IS TOO SMALL THAN YOU EXPECTED...PRICE IS GOOD, BUT NOT USEFUL..."
3,Overpriced!,"This rack is smaller than expected and thus overpriced. Unfortunately I bought it before it went on sale, and feel I paid at least twice what it is worth. It is well made, but should not cost more than ten or twelve dollars in my opinion. I'm left disappointed because of what I paid for it, but would have been happy with the purchase if I had paid what I feel it's worth."
2,Trapped into purchase,"I received the Spectrum Wall-Mount letter holder on 11/1/09 and found this item to be much smaller than advertised. When I attempted to reach a customer service representative about returning this item, the '800' and '500' phone numbers in the packing box did not have any options for returning this item. I had to email StacksandStacks, waited for a reply and explained that I had 30 days (11/30/09) to return this item. I received an automated reply from them on 12/2/09 on how to return this item. Beware trying to return items to this supplier. You'll end up being trapped into keeping it."
4,Sturdy key and mail rack,"Other than a slight design flaw that really warranted an exchange (the bottom mail ""shelf"" is welded to the frame at a little bit of an angle, causing the key hooks to also have a slight angle as well), this rack works great. I didn't feel like going through the effort of exchanging it, so I kept the one I received. It fits a lot of stuff without being too bulky on the wall (hubby said nothing wooden - that looks too ""granny""!) Note that it does not come with metal plaster anchors, just screws, so you may need to make a trip to your local hardware store for some additional supplies if you have plaster or drywall. Overall, pleased with the product compared to others available for purchase."
3,Black Scroll Letter Mail Organizer,A little smaller than what I expected. Still is a nice item that is serving the purpose at this time.
3,Fair Buy,A lot smaller than I expected...it doesn't hold as much mail as you'd think. But it's stylish and adds some flare to my living room. The hooks come in handy for car/house keys.
4,Good for your money,"This wasn't exactly what I had envisioned when I set out looking for a mail organizer, but does the job and looks nice. It will hold a TON of mail. Having a place to hang my ""weird"" keys (laundry, mail etc) is nice so they don't get lost sitting on a counter or something. I think that 4 holes to hold it to the wall is a little excessive, but maybe if you have a lot of mail ? . . . Over all it looks nice and functions well."
3,Looks great but can't fit magazines,"I was warned by other reviews, but went ahead and bought it anyways...It looks lovely on the wall, but you can't fit magazines sideways, which means you have to put them upright and then they flop over and kind of fall out. Great for envelopes but that's it,nothing wider ;/"
5,My wall mount review,"After purchasing this black metal wall mount, I did read previous reviews aboutr how unexpectedly small it was after being opened. So i did not right away expect the item to be large. But after opening it up and hanging it in my kitchen it served its exact purpose and was exactly what i had been looking for. Its great for placing the bills in and my stamps and other things. Besides being a little small, not extremely small, its decor is cute and suits just fine and glad i bought it!"
5,Looks nice and it's very sturdy,"I bought this letter holder to keep recipe cards and hang pot holders. I wanted to coordinate it with a spice rack, so I purchased it with a Spectrum Wall-Mountable Black Scroll Spice Rack. They go great together, adding functionality to my kitchen. The holder is a little smaller than the spice rack, which it's not so noticeable on the wall, but should be consider before hanging them. They're both very sturdy and well made which exceeded my expectations, considering how cheap they are."
2,A little bit disappointing,"The good :----------- Well structured content- The SQL part is not badThe Bad :---------- hardly any explanation on why to use this or that function- very bad programming style (= spaggetti code)- gives you the example then you'll have to figure out how it works in a lot of casesConclusion :------------Not very enthousiast about this book, the SQL primer is nicely written (but a little limited), the php part is D-grade level..If looking for a good book about php and mySql turn to the book edited by Worx (see my other review)"
1,Now I'd like to learn php and mysql,"I found myself looking elsewhere for the information I needed to understand just about everything in this book. I bought this book a couple of years ago and gave up on it, then came back to it recently as I needed to learn some of the information. It is very difficult to glean a thorough understanding of the subject matter from this book. BTW, it is not well-structured. I would have moved all of the mysql content to the front, with a thorogh explanation of those commands, and maybe adding a brief html overview, then explain the php. This guy makes a lot of references to stuff he hasn't explained yet."
4,Great Reference Book,"So far, the book has been very helpful although I would have liked to have seen more screen shots showing the results of the code. My first impression is that the book could have been better laid out, but otherwise it's a great reference book."
1,Throw it out,"Material is poorly presented. Author assumes programming knowledge on your part. You are often left floundering, wondering what the author meant. Found a much better book at my local library but it was, as you can imagine, seriously out of date. I have made it 1/3 of the way through this book and am considering tossing it in the trash."
2,superficial.......,"Way too superficial for the institutional investors... Although probably a nice start for privates it does not provide any indepth insight into the strategies employed by hedge fund managers or the risks involved.... For the professional investor I would recommend ""Absolute Returns"" from Ineichen, which covers the entire spectrum, from indepth analysis of the strategies employed to an extensive overview of market risk factors...."
5,Bridge the Gap Between Traditional Investing and Hedge Funds,"This outstanding book is perfect for bringing the comfort level of investors up in the seemingly arcane world of hedge funds. We recommend hedge funds to most of our high net worth clients and often we send a copy of this book to help them understand that ""hedge funds"" doesn't necessarily mean high risk. As we use them,they actually lower the risk of traditional investing. For those accumulating capital, traditional investing works well. But for those who want to preserve and live off it, the traditional markets can often be a very scary place.Highly recommended."
2,Not about Problem Management,"This book is about Incident Management, not problem management. Maybe this was written before ITIL made the differentiation between incidents and problems."
3,good content - badly written,"The content of the book is obviously interesting for people starting a help desk or any IT service department. I would just like to stress that it is badly written. Typical I-don't-have-much-to-say-but-I-will-say-it-in-200-pages syndrom. Example? p36 ""Problem can be discovered either before or after they occur"" Waow, that's information! p35 ""Problem identification is simply the processes, methods, and tools used by the service center to indentify a problem"". Hey M Walker, never learnt one should not use a word in its own definition?What's more the book isn't much instructive. Example? It is said that one can use the ""queuing theory"" the anticipate resource needs but don't expect the book to explain what this theory is."
1,rent it,"I bought this game because it looked cool.I beat it in about 20 hours.The game is as simple as walking into a room, killing some idiots, and figuring out some simple puzzles.Chopping a zombies head off is funny a total of 1 time.It is defenitly worth a ... rental not a ... buy.The graphics are really good but the game is ify."
1,a real dissapointment-,"Now i was really excitited when i heard that eternal darkness was coming out and i eagly waited. I rented it (do to a bad purchase of a previous game ""Gauntlet Legends: Dark Legacy-don't get it it is not nearly as good as the n-64 version) when i first played it the story line seemed cool and it appeared to be a good game, but as i got farther into it, i was very dissapionted the game play was easy and overall boring. The graphics are good which is a plus but they aren't excellent. The zombie fighting in this game is horrible and stupid. I beat this game in 3 hours! That is how easy it is and i feel that even though it was just three hours it was a complete waste of time! So anyway i strongly suggest you do not get this game or even rent it."
4,Creepy!,Entertaining and at times difficult seems to have a focus of keeping you moving forward. Nasty little buggers in there.
4,Eternal Darkness -gewd? ....To an extent...,"Eternal is a fresh survival-horror game that I have the utmost respect for. The reason for this is the innovative concept of ""sanity"" that one must maintain in order to view the very good looking world as a normal person would. The enemies can be somewhat intimidating at times, and they also have digusting sounds when they walk. The ""Magick"" system is great, and not too hard to understand. However, I found the fighting system bland and repetative. Aim for the arm, hack it off, or you can hack the head off, which will magic(k)ly grow back eventually if you don't kill it right away. How this happens is beyond me. So, there's nothing revolutionary about the fighting system. But the complex story line and the multitude of playable characters are what keeps you playing."
5,Sary that and a lot more,Eternal Darkness gives you a turn around a diffrent corner with the horror grenre with 12 diffrent playable charaters span over a near century gives you the advatage and as if you were in the game your self hits make you start to lose all control of whats real and whats not this game will give you a new definition of cool and scary thats for sure.
5,This game is terrifyling fun!,"This game is pretty scary, it is not for the weak hearted. Sure you think you can handle a few skeletons and dead guys, but once you stop playing it your mind continues to think about it. You start jumping at the slightest noise. The reason I continue to play it is so I can find out what happens, it has a great story line. Overall it's worth buying but will scare ... you. WARNING: To save you a possible heart attack I leave you this warning, on the second floor in the bathroom it gives you an option to examine the bathtub, don't, what happened made me freak out and even fall out of my chair.Fun Factor 100/100Freak Out Factor 10000/100Story Line 110/100Get it if you like getting scared."
3,Eh...,"The game started out really great. The insanity effects are definately cool and the magick system is well done too. The environments were nicely done and the characters were well varied. The big problem is that the game gets very tedious about half way through and then just boring at the end. The repetive ending levels are a drag and the lack of any real difficulty in the game makes it a snoozer. I say rent it or buy it used if your curious, but dont pay full price."
5,I had no idea what I was missing!,"I have to first give a big thanks to those who over the years have written reviews for this game. I was not a GameCube owner, but am a Wii owner who has been a bit disappointed in the lack of horror games. Thankfully the Wii is compatible with GameCube games. After reading about the influences of Lovecraft and Poe I decided to invest in this recently. Honestly I wasn't expecting much, but what a wonderful surprise this has been. While fighting with the ghouls can be a bit awkward the historic storyline is great. I am enjoying the puzzles, but must say the sanity meter is what is making me love my recent purchase. The fact that gameplay is effected to the point where it is disorientating is fantastic. When a horror game makes its way into my dreams I know it is a good one. Thanks for those great reviews and guiding me towards this! Wii owners looking for some survival horror might want to invest in this."
4,A good game for a Gamecube,"This game is a one of a kind videogame. Some may say it is a carbon copy of Resident Evil, but I say it is original enough to be in its own category. The story is you play as 12 different characters throughout the history of the world to try to uncover and destroy an evil force.Pros: The story and voice acting is second to none. The insanity meter is genius. The more zombies you see the more screw up the game got. For example your TV volume turns down, your character accidentally kills himself, and your memory card is corrupted. Don't worry it's not real it's just the game messing with you.Cons: The graphics aren't the best and there are too few boss battles. Another issue is that there are too few enemy types and your character can easily out run them.Overall this is a great game for 2002 and is still a great game today, just as long you are not an HD graphics nut. Of course if you have a Gamecube chances are you are not."
5,Stop Reading and Buy it!!,"...BUY!! This game is absolutely awesome. Words cannot do justice to how incredibly fun and addicting this game is. When you play it you feel like you're in another world and you don't want to stop playing. It looks beautiful, the characters move smoothly, and the camera almost always keeps a great angle. This game is a must have for anyone over the age of 13. Stop reading and order it now."
3,Wish it were more firghtening,"Eternal Darkness is, well, not frightening at all. The Sanity meter is the only thing that has kept me playing - although I haven't played it almost a month now b/c it got old. I was hoping for something along the lines of Resident Evil or the like.Why hasn't anyone thought of mixing resident evils' scare tactics with Eternal darkness's sanity meter?"
5,Awesome,Happy cause it was delivered very expected and the game box looks great as the game itself no problems. Just awesome thanxs to the seller for having the game and for selling for a great price. As for the game very scary buy fun.
5,I want Eternal Darkness 2 NOW!,"I just finished ED and loved it!Chthulian monsters, ritual magick, zombies,puzzles,and a great storyline made this a winner for me off the line.It's nice to have another quality spooky adult game come out of GC.The graphics definitely could have been a little cleaner, and there were a few minor glitches, but overall great game!"
1,don't bother,nothing to hold the shield up...just falls down and doesn't fit correctly too short to cover top to bottom as well
2,Too Small (VW GTI),"The shade seems nice. Doesn't have anything built in to keep it in place. Way too small for a 2009 VW GTI window (by about 6-8"")."
5,Jumbo Sunshade,This Jumbo Sunshde fits perfectly in my F-150 pick-up truck. I like the vlcro strap that holds it together also.
4,Met expectations for the price,The product is good for the price. Does the job well and is light and easy to handle. I'm satisfied with it in the Texas heat. :)
3,Average,"They keep the sun out, more or less. But they're huge. End up having to crumple them into the front window."
4,Does what it's supposed to do.,"Ordered it for my Accord. Sufficient, although a tad big. I have to fold on both edges to make it fit."
1,didnt sync,not sure if it's something I'm doing but I couldnt get it to recognize the hotsync to the computer which is the only reason I got it. Then since it didnt cost much it's costs me more to send it back so you end up just eatin$ it.
1,Doesn't hot sync!,Same as the others. Made the mistake of not reading the previous reviews. It has no button to push for hot sync so it DOES NOT HOTSYNC! Waste of money!
1,same here,I second that sentiment; my only consolation is that it was cheaper than the plain car charger I had tried from Wal-Market...
2,Cheesy,"Read other reviews online about this being a great easy basic beginner workout able to be done by very overweight people. It is very basic in fact done in someones living room! If you can get over the unproffessional element thats one thing...I have very bad knees and my mother has a bad ankle...we couldn't do this workout! The problem is that they have you getting up and down from one move to the next and even on your knees for part of it. Not good for people with arthritis or knee problems. Moves were simple enough, no aerobics just toning exercise. Disappointing overall, especially for the money! Would not recommend unless buying used somewhere for cheap."
2,Don't Know What I Paid For?,"I ordered this to check out the ""miracle"" of Seabuckthorn Oil. What I did not realize was that I would need to take 4 capsules a day (1000mg 2x a day) and that I had only ordered enough for 1/2 a month and needed at least a month to see any result. I wish I hadn't ordered at all, knowing now that I would need to have invested a minimum of $40 to see if there even was a positive result. A waste of $20, my bad. Shipping was fast, though."
1,thanks for nothing,The company said the product was in stock and then 10 days later sends me an email that my order has been cancelled because they don't have the product.Thanks for wasting my time.
4,Buckthorn,Excellent product and truthful advertising. Definitely will make a purchase again in the future as the seed oil works well as a dietary supplement.
1,Only suitable for the youngest Barbie fans,"This game is very cute and has a variety of mazes, searching-type activities, and the crucial jewelry-decorating section that is necessary in any Barbie game that somehow overlooks fashion and makeup, but my 7-year-old completed the entire game inside 20 minutes, including installation time. It was far too easy, and I can't see her ever playing it again. Unless your child is under the age of 5, I wouldn't recommend this game, at least not until it ends up in the Bargain Closeout Bin at your local retailer."
2,Way Too Short,"My 5 year old daughter finished the entire game in 42 minutes. The activities in the game are very simple. She still plays it but it doesn't compare to Barbie as Princess and the Pauper, or Barbies Pet Rescue which are much much better, quite a bit longer, and more replayable.Mermaid adventure's music I thought was quite good and I enjoyed the clown fish jokes but other than that I thought the game was poor at best."
2,Incredibly EASY game for toddler to play,"My daughter turned 4 in July 2005. I bought this September 16th, 2005. So my kid is just a few months past 4. She finished this game in less than an hour. This game is incredibly easy for any toddler who has played computer games before. The graphics are cute and the colors are vivid. My daughter did enjoy playing the game, but it really didn't offer any new challenges or teach her anything new.I would recommend this to a parent who has a child who has just learned to use the mouse and is just learning some simple concepts like ""matching"". This game would also be good to help a new computer user learn to use the mouse. Lots of navigation in this game with the mouse."
2,Too Easy,My just turned 5 year old completed the game within 2 hours and hasn't touch it since. Try another Barbie game like Barbie Horse Adventure.
3,An ok game...,"My daughter liked this game, but she finished it in like a half an hour. Which was very disappointing to both of us. The game is quite easy, and not very challenging. My daughter does like this game, and does still play it, but it does not compare to the other games she has. (Like Barbie Princess and the Pauper, great game!) So yes, even though she does like this game, dispite the shortness of it, I think we both would have prefered a better game."
1,Not worth the money,"We bought this game for my 6 year old daughter. She finished this game in less than an hour. There are only four levels and two ""activities"" per level. Its beyond easy. Total waste of money. Try something else."
4,A nice addition to Haydn's chamber works,"I came upon this CD by accident, and I'm glad I did. Until now I'd read about Haydn's baryton music but never heard it. While the intonation here is not always perfect, and the horns occasionally burst out of control, overall it is a fine performance. Haydn's scoring for several bass instruments makes for a very lush sound that never plods or sinks. The music here is vivacious and never degrades into the insipid. I was really surprised and pleased with this CD overall. It is truly enjoyable. And, having since heard John Hsu's sometimes dry baryton playing, I can recommend this one even more highly."
4,The only Gershwin CD you'll ever need (or at least the best),"The CD actually belongs to my roommate, but I listen to it even more than she does. As the name implies, this album contains both familiar songs (Someone to Watch Over Me, Fascinatin' Rhythm, But Not For Me) and some lavishing in undeserved obscurity (the sweet little Meadow Serenade is by far the best track). The album is not completely perfect; 'Someone to Watch Over Me,' for example, morphs from a sad show tune into a diva vehicle with scarcely a moment's notice. Still, this is one of my favorite CD's in, er, my roommate's collection: a good one to sing along with at the top of your lungs while housecleaning."
1,Tired of seperated novels,"After having read reviews of several books that could have been a dynamite single novel and instead were seperated into multiple books for possible money making reasons by the publisher/author I have decided not to purchase any more Star Trek novels that end with ""To Be Continued...."" Anyone with similar thoughts please write to the publishing companies. Let them know we feel abuse, robbed and are tired of getting short stories when we pay for full length novels."
3,GREAT BOOK! BUT WHERE'S THE ENDING?????,"If not for the ""To be Continued"" ending, this book would have been rated 5 stars! I loved this story as well as the other 3 on this same subject. But I can't believe that this was to be continued! Where is the rest of the story now? If I'd known that this last book was a continuation (without the follow up book even in the works yet!), I would never have purchased it!"
1,"Boring! With a capital ""B""","I like sci/fi, action, & thrillers. No sci/fi, action, or thrills here.I don't like the way she writes. Michael Crichton writes the way I think & speak. She does not. Her sentence structure is alien to me. Her frequent use of hard to pronounce Romulan names is irritating & hard to follow because I skip over these names & I lose track of who is who.I hated The Romulan Way & every other book I've read of hers. Her focus is on interpersonal & deep understanding of the ways of alien races. In Homer Simpsons voice, ""BORING!""I'm about 80% of the way through this book and I'm bored stiff. Now that I've learned that there's a part 2, I'm tempted to just stop reading it.This is not only the worst Star Trek book that I've ever read, it is THE worst book that I've ever read, Period!If you learned to speak the fictitious language of Klingon or enjoy learning the ways of fictitious alien races, this may be the book for you."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you...","That line from the Original Series is so appropriate for this book series. I read Swordhunt because I had really enjoyed the first two in the series. Then, when I hit the ""continued in Star Trek #96,"" I was so outraged, it took me almost five years to buy #96. Then, I find out not only did ""Honor Sword"" not finish the storyline, no conclusion has *yet* been published, I couldn't believe that I'd let them fool me again.Well, until the publishers stop printing books piecemeal--and in very expensive pieces, I might add--I'm done buying Star Trek novels."
4,Good preperation for the ACT,"This book offers very good preperation for the English portion of the ACT. I received a pretty bad mark on the English section the first time i took the ACT, so i bought this book. I went through the whole thing and the next time i took it, I got a perfect score!! I know i couldn't have done it without this book. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the author's style isn't the best, and makes the book a bit boring. But it is still very helpful."
2,Nothing but problems,Cannot use grill due to faulty gas valve and lask of seller response in replacing. Will need to find another brand.
1,shouldashopdlowes,"What a dissapointment this piece of crap was. Sorry, but it really is not worth but maybe half the price. I could have gone to Lowes or Walmart and got a larger and more user friendly grill for less. Valve to cannister setup is awkward and poorly designed."
2,"Don't buy these, just buy another cabinet.","The dividers are simple pieces of injection-molded plastic, but the drawers into which they're supposed to fit are far too flexible to reliable hold them in place. The drawers work fine by themselves, but dividers are useless. It would be a better expenditure simply to buy another Stack-On drawer cabinet."
4,Stack-on drawer dividers,"I can't believe these aren't supplied with the storage bins! You can order them for half the price on the Stack-on website, but they don't have an online shopping cart. You would have to call or snail mail an order form. Don't know how much they charge for shipping, either. Oh well, I need them, so I'm going to order them through Amazon."
2,Not well-made,"These dividers are supplied in strips which must be broken apart. They don't break apart cleanly, so the dividers look very rough. Since they're inside a drawer, they don't need to look great - it just seems that a better way of manufacturing them could be found."
2,Expensive and poorly finished,"First, it's absurd that the Stack-On storage containers don't come with a few of these. You essentially pay $6+ for pieces of plastic that fit in the little grooves of he small plastic drawers. These allow you to better organize small parts that do not take the entire drawer.This product, besides costing too much for what it is, is very poorly finished: The dividers come together in a single ""sheet"" of plastic, with ""pre-cut"" grooves where you would theoretically snap them apart from each other. Unfortunately, the grooves are not thin enough and you're sure to break/bend/mark some dividers trying to do so. You'll also have to deal with rough/sharp edges where the ""cut"" happened.Cut yourself some 2"" x 1 1/16"" rectangles out of a 1.5mm sheet of hard plastic and you'll have better results paying less."
3,They work but need some work,Other have mentioned this and I had the same problem: breaking the tabs from the stack leave sharp edges that can draw blood. I had to spend a lot of time smoothing out the rough edges so they fit better in the drawers.
5,"""Take me out to the old ball game!""/Visionaryprophetdaniel","This novel Kit is a good fair play of an old sports institution that uses a theme song based upon ""The Old Timers Waltz"" music piece for singing ""Take Me Out to the old Ball game!""...etc... The cards have a beautiful air-brushed picture on each card all the way through the deck with their own card titles. But, if there any ""dislikers"" of this Tarot; that's ok...""cause we can shake it off!"" A Beginner or an Initiate who knows the game can learn the Tarot quicker (My ex-wife did and enjoyed it immensely learning the Tarot). However, one has to know the standard card titles. The ""Fair Play"" meanings are a departure from the Rider-Waite-Smith Industry standard. Sports Fans out there should have Tarots done for other major sports such as NFL/AFL;NBA;NHL; and so on- Let's get creative at The Old Ball Game,shall we!??...Blessings..."
1,very old and has lots of marks and not clean,"This book is beyond my ""expectation. Not only very old but also has lots of marks and not clean. I will not believe online shopping any more"
5,Antigone!,"I really liked this book. Antigone in particular. Although, it doesnt make sense how the three books by Sophocles were separated and only two are here, still the translators are great and clear."
4,Various stories make or break Lattimore's translations,"Lattimore does a good translation of several greek tragedies in this book. The book is great in terms of the stories that are presented, especially Oedipus the King. Oedipus is THE example of the perfect Greek tragedy. It is moving, ironic, and sad combined into a play. However, the same could not be said for Agamemnon; which is not only dull in reading, but also long and pointless in plot and storyline. Any sense of emotions and feeling is completly deprived in Aeschylus's play. Overall, it is a good book and reflects upon the early writers and their beliefs of tragedy."
3,myth class,"I used this book for my mythology class. While the plays are interesting, they are also very simple."
1,XL fit like a M,this item is sized way too small. we used to purchase this size for my husband and they fit perfectly; these wereso small they were useless.
2,falls apart,"after using the item twice the stiching has started to fall out and teh supporter in another washing will not be usable, cost was right, product was inferior."
5,perfect jock,"I looked all over for a light weight, thin strapped, soft fabric jock for swimming. I couldn't find one. This is the best there is out there in the meantime. Someone please make a thinner strapped swimmers jock covered in a soft nylon fabric. You would sell lots."
5,Good light,I installed it a few months ago and it is still going strong. The package of 10 was a great deal.
2,Pretty but not very informative,Pretty horses but very basic and not very informative. I was disappointed in the content from an educational point of view.
2,Old and fairly outdate,I bought this book because I like to have older raft guides. It hardly has any rivers and the rivers that are listed you can easily get better information for free from other websites.
5,Amazin Finding Product Service,"The Amazon service to find the exact memory for my computer is amazing.The product worked with no problem, nice product, great service."
5,Oh for shame...,"No doubt a wonderful guide, but, why the highway robery!? I can't believe people would charge so much for a guide you can still puchase from the publisher. (http://www.primagames.com/strategy/book/4633) -You guys should be ashamed of yourselves!"
2,Look at - don't read - this book!,"A lovely compendium of pictures worth looking at, but don't read the commentary! While the artists may be doing noteworthy work, there was too much whining and self-congratulations to suit my taste. A book such as this is no forum for scolding others who are influenced by their techniques. After all, didn't the millefiori technique come from the Venetians? The writing, I thought, was amateurish and poorly written. As I said, if you buy it, look at the pictures, but avoid reading it."
1,A waste of time and money.,"As an avid consumer of books about polymer clays, I was extremely disappointed in this one. It was basically a self- indulgent exploration of the writer's opinions. The artists discussed do NOT go in 5 directions at all. I have numerous books on the subject, every one of which is superior to this one. DON'T buy it!!!"
5,Nice book,"This is a beautifully illustrated book...a nice compendium of work by a diverse group of artists. Some of the criticism here seems a bit unfair. The book is explicitly biographical. To criticize it for NOT being something else, surprised me.I found this book to be encouraging and motivating. If others can accomplish such beautiful results, maybe I can too."
1,This CD is not worth the money I paid for it.,"I purchased this CD because some reviews compared Dana Mase to Tori Amos...not even close. This CD was very disappointing. Her voice sounds like it was done on a kareoke machine at a local bar. The actual music isn't that bad, but very repetitious and uneventful. Her music has strong ties to religious beliefs (I believe she's Jewish). Definately not what I expected. Very poorly sung and unprofessional. Sorry."
5,Beautiful Game,My girls (ages 3 and 5) love this game. The graphics are beautiful and the activities do actually teach them something. I highly recommend it.
3,Lila the annoying Unicorn,"My daughter enjoys playing this game on our iMac OS. She was able to understand the concept of the game within an hour. A smart four year old.But the one thing we did agree on is that the unicorn, Lila, got pretty annoying at times with her pointless comments."
5,Music is the Medicine,"This is an amazing CD...buy it!! I discovered it in Albuquerque at the Native American museum and couldn't get enough of it on our road trip to Marfa, Texas and back...it cures the blues in Connecticut, too.I am giving it as a gift to family and friends as well."
4,Great read,"I loved this. A great story, and I definitely want to read the original works by Leslie Charteris. I almost don't want to see the movie now. I liked the beginning, where we learn what made Simon the Saint. And updated for the 90's. If the movie is even half as good, Hollywood's accomplished something"
4,A definite must!,It's obvious that Barer had fun writing this; unlike the actual movie he's worked in so many elements of those adventures my friend Charteris wrote that it makes this book great fun to read about my adventures before. It's a wonderful improvement on the movie!!Wonderful Stuff!!
5,A Moving Story!!!,Peretti has written a story that tugs at your heart strings and has delivered an awesome message that could not have been done better by anyone else.It is a must read for all ages.
1,wasted money,This product was mistakenly ordered but the vendor refused to swap it for the correct product because it was outside of the return date.
5,Wonderful,"As an introductory book teaching classical (and some modern) optics, this wonderful book is difficult to beat.It prepares you remarkably well for any direction in optics you then want to set off in. The explanations are mostly crystal-clear, crafted with great care. Lots of words and diagrams, not too much math, but enough math to facilitate useful calculations.An excellent under-graduate text, to my mind, the best available today."
5,Just as described,"Just as described, it has some wear-out on the binding, but the interior is good. Perfect price for a second-hand and still fair condition book.by the way, Optics by Hecht is a great book for me! Very clear physical pictures and helps me lot on my PhD qualified exams!"
4,Haunting,"A thriller?! Yes! Gross?! Yes!, and yes, again! Not my kind of book, but...I was encouraged to read it, and once I started, could not get the characters off my mind. Aleta has a way with a story-line. I didn't want to put it down. Her style is just as thrilling as any I have read in the past,in this genre. I find myself wondering where Aleta's next book will lead Tina, and Elaine! If this is your type of book, read,""Evil Randum""!"
5,Exactly what I needed to replace my 4th Edition!,"This is one of the best general physical science books I've seen. I've enjoyed the 4th edition for years, and I wanted a later edition. This one is great! Seller was quick to ship, everything in good order."
3,Required Text For A Class,"This item was a required text for my physical science course. It is undeniably a bore. Of course, this review is biased considering I am not a fan of physical science, and therefore cannot give a completely accurate review."
3,Shotgun grooms,"I enjoyed this book. There were three different stories in this one book. Sadly, the last story was not as good as the first two."
4,Interesting book,"This was a great book to read with my son, who is interested in becoming a vet. It has lots of compelling photographs and good information."
5,Hysterical fun. Great gift for any gearhead,Everyone gets a big laugh at this goofy toy. Even if you're not a gearhead you'll enjoy it and it looks good on my desk.
1,bad book,This is a horrid book. It is the worst example of a book written to make some money--why does the West eat this stuff up? Why can we not have an indian-american novel that does not make itself so exotic the whole time. nauseating and drab--sickly-sweet and frustratingly predictable.
3,Good Indian feel...,"Maya returns to India, her homeland, after her parents find an excuse to send her there for the summer. It's been three years since 15 year old Maya has been to India, the land where she lived as a child for several years with her grandmother. The book is descriptive, and makes you feel like you are transported there. Details are explained when the reader encounters something that may be hard for a non-Indian to understand. There are two main storylines, one dealing with the government that I didn't really care for, and one dealing with the larger story of Maya's connecting to her Indian self. The book got slighly more boring as it went on however."
1,ick,"what is one to say? Perhaps the most boring book to hit the shelves in recent years. Tired plot, one-dimensional characters, exhausted imagery. Ick."
4,splendid,I was really captivated by the way the novel is written.It is so descriptive of everything.I am sure every indian american would have similarities with maya.highly recommended.
5,Great book.. :-),i have just been to india for a holiday and i thought this book was fantastic! i really enjoyed reading this book and the plot was exciting and unexpected ! :-)
1,not worth the read,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read--why are new ""diasporic"" Indian novels in vogue right now? This one is the worst example of it--better to turn your attention to books like Shadowlines by Amitav Ghosh or Cracking India by Bapsi Sidhwa. This book is shoddily written, and badly in need of a good editor."
5,Why life is worth living&#65533;,"I started reading Motherland on Sunday evening, which was a grave mistake. I couldn't put it down until I finished the whole story in the early hours of Monday morning. I was enchanted by the harmony of simple family life and the beauty of the exotic, far away country. I was fascinated by the details of everyday life, of mundane activities like brushing hair or taking a bath. It all seemed so foreign, yet so familiar. Didn't summers seem so slow and tranquil when you where a child? The surroundings, the customs, the food are all different but the happiness that loving family and simple life bring are universal."
1,Boring,I have no idea why anyone would publish this book other than the fact that the person is now an HBS graduate.Being an Ivy leaguer means you cna get away with anythin I suppose
4,Very Successful,The information in this book is very useful for starting a small advertising business. It offers information from setting up your agency to pricing each job. It's a small price to pay for the knowledge that I haved gained from this book.
5,"Embroidered Baby Doll, Ivory","Very Pretty, it fits perfect, the packaging was good, and the shipping was fast. No problems at all, i like the outfit a lot, and it is soft and comftorable also."
4,Life Blood,"It was a pretty intense book but it took a while to get going, but once it got going I had a hard time putting it down. It really makes you stop and think how much trust we put in our Dr.'s when they do procedures on us, that they are not doing things for their own personal adjenda."
1,Life Blood,Did not get very far with this book. Author uses God's name in vain too many times. One can write a book without doing that
1,Couldn't Finish It,"This book is so poorly written I couldn't finish it.Tedious,cliche-ridden,predictable."
1,I agree,"I have to agree with the majority of the negative reviews. This isn't the book for me, and it appears I am not alone in my thinking. I will try another by Mr. Hoover someday, but not right away. It was free, and maybe that should have told me something. I didn't finish it."
3,Interesting Story,"I have now read a number of Thomas Hoover's novels I downloaded this when it was free but found that it was the weakest of the stories so far and would have given it 2 stars if possible. Although the plot is good and it slowly builds up developing characters and details of location the detail in the plot is weak, particularly towards the end where too much depends on luck and things just happening in the right order. Still worth reading but I do not think I would pay the full price for it, strangely enough this is still available free at the time of writing but with a different cover."
3,So so,"One of those books that I wasn't sure if I'd keep going with until I was nearly halfway through, but ended up being a decent read."
4,great read,I never heard of this author before. It is fun to find something within my budget to add to my reading list. Amazon.com and Kindle are the greatest. I am always able to find a good mystery here. And the price is always great. I would be lost if I couldn't use my tablet to read.
1,biggest disapointment EVER!!!!!,I've rarely been as disapointed as I was when I found out the best scene in the Duckman series possibly the greatest scene in TV history was missing on the dvd. In the episode when they do the Star Trek reference the scene where Duckman seduces the women by recreating Will Shatner's unforgetable rendetion of Tambourine Man is CUT OUT!!! Are you kidding me?! It makes me ill just typing this. Yes I think this was one of the greatest TV shows ever but when the distributors do this it's just inexcusable. So you've been warned. Paramount and CBS you owe us all a huge apology and a refund.
4,Worth it,Seasons three and four completes the series. Still funny are all these years. I wonder if we'll ever find out about what happened to Beatrice.
3,"For the price, it's a pretty good tool",For the price - it's an okay tool. They don't take well to abuse. The adapters chip and the press tool itself bends. All of this occurs when you're not even using air tools.The only saving grace is that the tools are warrantied by Astro Pneumatic.
3,You get what you pay for,"This kit comes with a lot of adapters and just about everything you need to do many jobs. The only downfall is the quality of the press itself. The metal seems to ""ding"" easily so when doing U-Joints, it is hard to get it to hold straight. All and all it worked just fine for what I needed it for and it should do the same the next time."
3,"Instructions are horrid, press is not large enough to press in new lower ball joint",I used this press to remove the lower ball joints on my 1995 Ford Explorer. I've never used a ball joint press before. The instructions were horrid and confusing. I learned how to use it by using Google and watching online videos and then playing with it using a new lower ball joint on my workbench.It worked great to press out the old lower ball joint (used impact gun and 22mm deep socket) but it was not big enough to press in the new joint. I had to use one of the receiving tubes and the removing adapter on a jack to press in the new joint. I raised the jack until the new ball joint was in the control arm hole and had weight on it. Then I lightly hammered the control arm downward to press in the new ball joint.I am disappointed I could not use it to press in the new ball joint which is why I did not rate it higher.(By the way using a jack / hammer method is way faster than using the tool to install anyway)
5,ball joint press,"I just replaced ball joint in a 2003 Acura tl. I had rented a press from auto zone, which was a small set and didn't have the right adapters. This is a musch larger set and had every thing I needed. Worked perfectly"
1,Doesn't work on 2003 Silverado 2500HD 4X4,"I spoke with the manufacturer and asked if this would work on my 2003 2500HD even though the product details through 1997. I was told it would work up to 2004. WRONG!@ The only socket that comes close to my ball joint on the LCA does not fit into the bottom groove of the LCA ball joint slot. The socket slipped offset damaging the socket badly and warped the C-Tool way out of whack. The case is made of thin plastic, I had this shipped by air which means turbulance, needless to say the case was damaged all over the inside with huge cracks. Although this set has a nice variety of tooling sizes, it just, simply put, is not strong thick metal needed for heavy duty jobs. I returned this product to Amazon."
3,Well...,"My sister ordered this for me for my birthday on Saturday and it got here yesterday. She ordered it new, but...unfortunately it's not new and it definitely didn't arrive in top condition. It had what looked like juice stains on it and it felt like it was missing stuffing in the upper part of its body.All I can say is, what happened Amazon?"
5,Perfect baby lovey,"My son just turned three and still can't let go of his puppy. My in-laws bought this for him when he was three months old and he really started to become attached when he was around 10 months. We've already had to buy a replacement, because original puppy got pretty dirty and ragged over a year and a half of constant love. Honestly, perfect size and squishy-ness for a little one. :)"
3,A bit hollow,"Not a bad idea--one should not stress out about things you can't fix right away, or without all the info you need--but this book is rather hollow on specifics."
5,Dollar for dollar the best investment I`ve made in years.,The book came into my life at a perfect time. It has helped me liberate my mind to focus on the real important things in life. Before the book I was considering going on blood pressure medicine- NOT ANYMORE! Enjoy.
5,Shows the importance of will power and mental focus,"This book teaches readers how to change their mindsets to become more calm and more content. Downplaying technology and material items, the authors suggest controlling your life through your thoughts and actions. The book discusses the mental aspects of simplicity, not specific actions that you can take. It stresses the importance of being autonomous and not using material items as crutches; the book does not address the need for exercise or awareness of your surroundings."
2,Buddhism Lite,"It seems like large chunks of the text are paraphrases of Buddhist belief with serial numbers filed off (so to speak). The similarities aren't acknowledged at all, which I find a bit annoying. The authors give all the credit to the 'Psychology of Mind' organization."
3,Too repetitive...needs more practical advice,"Do not be mislead by the title. If you are looking for tactics you can use to simplfy your live, you will not find these here. This book talks more to what is happening in you mind. The author contends that we think about things in one of two ways. We either analyze a situation or thought to death or we let the thought come and go. It is when we allow free flow thinking to guide us that we feel less rushed and more in control thus living a simpler life. The ideas in this book make a great deal of sense. However, after reading about three-quarters of the way through, you want solutions to the situations. You want to know what you can do to get into the free flow. There is a lot of theoretical stuff here that gets repeatred time and again, but very little practical advice about how to get to the desired place."
2,this bike is HEAVY,"my son won this bike in a raffle. nice looking bike, it's rugged, cool-looking, has a ""wow-factor"" with the neighbor boys at first. But this bike is incredibly heavy. It looks like a tank of a bike, and it IS. It's not a very nimble, agile bike due to the weight. Put another way, the only way we would own this bike is by winning it."
4,Great deep bass!,"This CD contains perhaps the best, high-energy bass track ever recorded, ""Scarred"", by Luke (Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew Fame). If you like to move, if you're into car audio, this CD is a must have."
1,Printer is not for graphic designers,"Yes, the prints do look like photographs, they don't look like the sheet fed or web press piece you are attemping to comp or proof. The inks and paper cost a fortune. Figure on spending lots of time and money calibrating the colors. Then it has 7 inks, if one of them runs out -- it won't print. A set of inks runs costs over $80 and will print about 20 large sheets with heavy coverage. Even with all its warts the Epson 3000 was a much better printer for comps and press checking graphics."
2,Hardware failure,"This printer produced excelled quality prints, if quite slowly. However, I had two hardware problems, one fatal. This printer was used for specialty work, so it was not used every day. As a result, I found that I had to print junk at least once a week or so or the printheads would clog, requiring a clean cycle (which wastes ink).More seriously, the printer recently just failed - when it is turned on it sounds like something is broken. The Status Monitor no longer communicates with the printer and the manual imples that the fact that ALL of the lights are flashing means it has an ""Unknown error"" and must be taken to a dealer (which would probably cost more than the printer is worth).Until this error, I would have given this printer 4 stars, but a fatal error on a printer which has not seen that much work has lowered my former good opinion of Epson."
5,TWICE AS EXPENSIVE - FOUR TIMES THE QUALITY,"I have had my Epson 2200 for two weeks now and it is worth the hype. The reviews found in this area strongly suggesting the use of Epson paper and anticipated heavy ink usage are right on the mark. However, if you want prints superior to those provided by a photo store, this is your printer. If you don't plan to do photos, then buy a cheaper printer. This is too much machine for you. If you do buy it, there is a learning curve. Expect to eat up a quantity of paper and ink in identifying the best settings for your needs. But when you get there - wow - what a printer."
5,Three years and going with one happy owner,"It's been three years since I bought this printer; hundreds of photographs later with dozens of color cartridges spent I can honestly claim that this is one fantastic printer. I use it in La Paz, Bolivia (13,000 feet high) and I never had a problem with the printer or with the quality of the prints. The color profiles that come with most professional paper make it a snap to print form Photoshop. The only possible down-side to this printer is that the cartridges are very expensive and don't last much, but for the quality of the prints produced... this is one well though out product that will last a long, long time."
3,Both Positive and Negative Reviews are Accurate,"This is NOT a consumer printer. It takes a lot of tweeking and you might find yourself on the phone with tech support (very good, btw) to get the results you want. In no way is this a plug and play printer: you've got to consider paper choices, ICC profiles, etc. And yes, the glossy performance is poor due to the ink characteritics. It is a great printer, but expect some frustration.The only innacurate comment I read on these pages was about the separate ink cartridges. On this printer, each color has its own cartridge which over time will save you money. That's because colors get consumed unevenly depending on the printing you are doing. This is a good feature."
3,Mixed feelings,"Great print quality on premium glossy photo paper when you look at them directly - but terrible when you looked at them from an angle. They look splotchy and not ""glossy"". Epson kind of acknowledges this but says it will look better on matt or semi-matt papers.Windows XP driver default installation caused my machine to reboot spontaneously. I thought my computer was broken! The driver needs to be partially uninstalled to work, but then it works fine.Couldn't find ICM color profiles after installing the software, but you can get them from Epson UK or Australia web sites.Couldn't find a color profile for the ColorLife paper."
1,My 2200 a lemon,"This purchase was a nightmare. First, the printer was incompatible with my page layout program (InDesign CS) when it came to printing custom-size (poster) pages. The jobs simply won't process. One Epson technician I talked to (and there were many calls to Epson technical support) basically conceded that the 2200 doesn't do well with InDesign-type post-script software. And InDesign CS, which comes with Photoshop and Illustrator in the CS package, is not an obscure program. I was able to get some jobs out in Illustrator (cumbersome in page layout duty) but then there were problems with banded lines and jams. It's the worst purchase I ever made."
3,Not Pleased,I bought the Epson 2200 because I wanted a large format printer that would produce quality prints from digital images. Unfortunately the 2200 isn't the answer. Live and learn.I have tried every paper that I can find including Epson's Premium papers. Nothing works to my satisfaction.Every picture I print is dull and appears to have a thin film over top of the photo. I have tried everything I know to get rid of it. If I increase the brightness of a picture that helps somewhat to rid the film but then the picture itself suffers.I wouldn't buy another Epson product after reading and believing what was written on this product. Give me an HP or Canon any old day.
2,Don't Be Fooled By Advertisements,"I am totally disappointed in the quality of prints this machine puts out. There appears to be a fine fog over your prints, I wrote Tech support and they told me that the ""bronzing"" was normal with UltraChrome inks. Now that would be great to know before you plunk down upwards of $700 for a wide format printer.I guess I am too unsophisticated to understand ""archival quality"" is another way of saying poor visual quality. I could care less if it lasts a lifetime if it isn't what I want.Using Matte paper reduces the effect somewhat but again, nowhere in the advertisements or instructions do you find this, nope you have to get ahold of Tech Support to find out that what you get isn't really what you wanted even though all the ads say it is.Maybe Epson could consider a choice of inks for this machine.Save your money folks, stick with Canon or HP."
3,Disappointing monochrome,"Just began using my new Epson 2200 printer. I am disappointed in the depth of the black printer using Epsons Premium glossy paper I can't get the rich, deep blacks I got with my Epson 1200 printer using the same paper.The 2200 has a longer scale thsn the 1200 and it colors are more accurate with less of a green or magenta cast. But the 2200's lackluster black printing is causing me to rethink my purchase"
1,easy to breakdown,"I read review on line and brought this printer, but turn out the pigmented inks have lots of problems. I wonder what photo experience the other reviewers have. I put a ton of money and time into getting an acceptable workflow, send back and forth to repair. The same problem occur with my coworker as well. I hope you will make wise choice."
1,Caveat emptor,"Before you buy this printer, be warned: YOU CANNOT PRINT BORDERLESS ON MATTE PAPER! I print hundreds of matte pages a month on a Stylus Photo 820...and upgraded to the 2200 because of its touted matte ink capability. But once you put the matte cartridge in, you can't select border-free printing on the sides. And printing with the photo cartridge is indeed an inferior option, if you're looking for crisp, sharp blacks on matte paper, so ""fooling"" the printer by saying you're printing on photo paper doesn't work.I can only hope Epson is working on a driver update, as I'm ready to send this printer back."
2,Do not be blinded by the hype!,"While this printer is indeed better than many, it still has a long, long way to go to compete with your analog print producer on the corner. You *will* see grain and red-saturated prints in spite of your best efforts. If you must have an Epson, they offer comparable quality sub [price]"
1,out of stock for months,"So what if it's a good product if no one has it in stock? Epson is totally unresponsive! Epson is promoting the product, yet it's not producing enough units so that people can buy it!"
5,Can't wait to get my hands on this!!,"I have been in the market for a new photo printer for about a month now. After reading reviews and magazine articles I've decided to go with an Epson even though I usually buy HP's. What is really exciting me is the archival quality inks that this printer uses, and the photo quality that other Epson's exhibit. (I'm sure this will continue the high standard of excellence.) There is only one thing that is holding me back a bit. A similar Epson printer (the 1280) is a real ink hog. Obviously, this can add up fast when printing photos that require a full page of ink, but I am willing to accept this for a great printer.Hope this helps!"
3,Good printer but not for casual user,"The color and quality are fine. Problem is if you do not use the printer often, you will need to keep cleaning the heads and wasting ink. Also while the roll paper is nice feature the paper curl seems almost impossible to remove. Unless you are printing large prints and use often I would opt for something else.The HP 475 has worked great for our occassional printing and I like the fact that we can take it with us and print direct from cards on battery power."
2,pretty disappointed,"well, first of all, the title said ""no fat"" and well, almost all of the recipes here have fat in them, and the desserts have almost the same amount of fat as regular desserts! also, the recipes have no pictures, so it's a bit hard to follow. for some reason, and this may be the fault of my own, i expected more vegetarian recipes, and there really weren't that many (there was also a TON of dairy involved) but i guess other people ought to know that before they consider buying this. all in all i have to admit, i wouldn't recommend this book to my friends."
4,I Liked It!,I liked the book. The book is small and written in a larger than normal print. There are quite a few recipes that are easy to make and actually taste good. I have tried many of them myself. My copy is dated 1981. But the recipes are easy to read and following the directions is not a problem.
4,an enjoyable read,not quite as good (in my opinion) as Starting From Scratch but still a wonderfully written tale with characters you can fall in love with.
4,Highly Informative (and Neutral) Look at the FDA,"Democrats want more Big Pharma regulation and consumer protection. Republicans want to protect Big Pharma's profits. The tobacco and diet supplement industries want to be left the hell alone. And consumers want miracle drugs for free. Somehow, some way, the FDA navigates the minefields of the food and drug industries every day and tries to base its decisions on science. While some authors take cracks at the FDA because of a political agenda, Fran Hawthorne remains neutral and thus provides the most level-headed look at the FDA that's on the shelves. While the reading is pretty dense, this is a book that every concerned citizen needs to read."
3,"If you want to know about an administration that controls a third of our economy, this is the first step.","If you know nothing of the FDA, than this will blow your mind. By the time you are through half the book you will be considered an expert on the subject by all your friends.Not one of the more exciting reads, but extremely informative. Not just about what you might think it is about, but much much more. This book will give a clearer view of where we all live."
3,It was okay,I enjoyed the book and was able to use much of the material. Although much of the material was from the authors perspective.
5,FP in practice--still using it on call!,"I used the first edition of this book as a med student and as a resident, and it got totally worn bc I used it so often.I've been out in practice for over 5 years now, and I still use it (newer edition) when I'm on call, and even in the clinic.It's great because it gives the info you need for assessing and managing common acute in-patient problems (""elevator thoughts""), and lists the most critical and the most common differential diagnoses.It's also very concise, so you can find info fast, and not have to go flipping through pages of useless info when someone on the ward is crashing.It's well worth the money."
1,light,Dont buy it it is boring you just dress them up and you do a makeover.dont buy this game it is a waste of money.
1,you've got to be kidding me...,"This lame (ahem) game is the most annoying game on the face of this earth. Here's the story. I really enjoyed Barbie Digital Makeover and thought this game would be as fun or even better. So I bring it home to play and I realize what a waste of time and money it was to buy that game. There aren't even half of the hair color choices the BDM had, the Barbies talking and moving their heads was SOOOOOO annoying, the headbands looked like fifty rolled up, tidyed paper towels, they were so huge, and the outfits didn't even go together!!! What was really annoying was how even if you cut Barbie's hair REALLY short, died it blue, and put on a headband as tall as the rockies, she would move her head around and say, ""I love my new look,"" or, ""This is so pretty!"" It was corny and cheesy and a lame lame LAME follow-up to BDM."
1,Horrible,"Skips all the time. I adjusted the nib and even took apart the feed to make sure all the channels were clean and cut through, but a bad pen is a bad pen. I heard others say theirs worked well for them. Mine sucked from the get-go. However, messing with the feed and nib helped it out a little. But it's still not a reliable writer. WOULDN'T RECOMMEND (not to mention the lacquer easily chips off and reveals the copper or bronze underneath which happened to my rollerball version of this pen)."
3,Heavy and skips,Good ergonomics but ink skips. This is very annoying. A pen should be able to write first. I have only used the cartridge so far.
4,Waterman Fountain Pen,This is elegant product. I received as I had thought about it. Write smooth but not as cross fountain pen. Overall nice product for the price.The market price is much high.
4,"94-97 CHEVY CHEVROLET S10 PICKUP s-10 GRILLE TRUCK, With Sealed Beam Headlamps, Black (1994 94 1995 95 1996 96 1997 97) 6986 156",It fit with no problems. Good price. If your going to spray paint this use a primer first.
5,flawless album by junkies and a rummy,"This is a flawless album. My favorite of 1989. One of the few Five Star reviews by Kerrang and others that actually deserves all five. Not a bad song on the entire album and the second singer just adds a nice twist. Best album of 1989. Just ask Slash, it was his too. Too bad the dope killed them."
1,not worth reading,I had to read this book for a class I am taking. The content starts out good but quickly comes very repetitive. The author seems to have a chip on his shoulder.
2,Great Title - Disappointing Content,"I have attempted to read as many educational resources as possible on the subject of multicultural ministry, because I believe it is vital that Christian leaders in North America become more effective in reaching out to their diverse communities. Thus, I was thrilled to see a book published on ""A Spirituality for Leadership in a Multicultural Community."" However, upon reading Law's book, I felt that his observations could have been summarized in a few pages. If all you are looking for is a resource that highlights that ""whites of Northern European origin - tend to dominate,"" - then, this is the book for you."
2,An Odd View of Multiculturalism,"Eric Law does an injustice, IMO, to the idea of multicultural community by making it sound very unappealing for whites (who are equated with wolves) as opposed to people of color (lambs). Law, who is an Episcopal priest, tells us at length that whites are supposed to ""bear the cross"" (give up their presumed power) in order to welcome people of color who are presumed to be ""on the cross."" Class, gender, age and other systems of inequality are all brushed off; only race appears to count. And all people of color are presumed by Law to behave the same: remarkably like the stereotype of meek Chinese (Law is Chinese). I really had to wonder if Law has any significant experience with African-Americans.On the plus side, Law offers a very helpful original suggestion with his idea of Mutual Invitation as a way of organizing multiracial discussions."
3,school book,this book was ordered just for a class. it was ok. I would not have purchased it on my own.
4,Thinking Green - Napkins?,"These napkins remind me of old Taco Bell napkins. They are brown and a little stiff. I don't look for much in a napkin so the color doesn't matter much to me. But since they are a little stiff I wouldn't recommend cleaning a large wet spill with them. While they are effective they don't absorb that fast. But if you care enough to be interested in more environmentally sound products try these, I feel good knowing the are 80% post consumer recycled and for my family it is worth the color and texture."
2,Do You Really Need to Pay for This?,"Don't get me wrong, I really like ThinkGeek, but you can get on their e-mail newsletter list and catalog mailing list FREE! It's really silly to pony up money for this, even if it's not that much."
2,Paying to look at things to buy?,"Subscribing to the Thinkgeek blog means paying $1.99 per month to be able to look at a small subset of things that Thinkgeek sells. Paying that much to view advertisements is crazy, in my opinion. It seems to me that if Thinkgeek wanted to sell their wares with a Kindle-format catalog, they ought to make it free for the reader."
1,Paying money for nothing,"Since with the built-in-browser, I can view the full ThinkGeek website for free, if not as well formatted, I think I'll pass on paying money for a sample. Would subscribe if it was free, and might even make ThinkGeek some extra money from sales...but it looks like they don't want the buisness that bad."
2,Waste of Time,"I do not understand the things that ThinkGeek keeps doing. They used to be such a great store to shop from, but now they are charging for this and removing products out of stock at the same time. We love the Zombie Blood and Zombie Jerky. They pulled both off their site, but we now either buy from the manufacturer (Harcos Labs) or right here on Amazon. Actually, there isn't too much that ThinkGeek sells that you can't find on Amazon."
1,poor service,this is the worst service i have ever had. how many days do you need to get something that you ordered 2ed day air. i am very not happy with this company
4,Not as good as the first...,"The second in the Mammoth Trilogy. Not as fascinating as the first, But still an entertaining read. Wish it had been offered in Kindle/ebook format as well."
3,Of mammoths and men,"Second part of the Mammoth trilogy isn't a huge improvement from the first. This time it's a look at prehistoric times, when mammoths roamed the Earth in larger numbers. Longtusk, the legendary mammoth mentioned in the first part of the trilogy, is still young and adventurous.He is captured by Fireheads, humans, and put to work along almost domesticated mastodonts. He learns the ways of the Fireheads and what danger they pose to the mammoths. Is he able to escape and save his family from this new danger?The best thing about this book is definitely its length - if it wasn't such a small book, I probably wouldn't have bothered to read it. If you really loved the first part and want to read more about mammoths and don't mind more violence and not-that-interesting mammoth characters, go ahead, but others might just as well skip this one. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)"
5,These are Awesome! Please re-stock them!,"I bought two of these from a local outdoor store, and one fell out of my hunting pack. I hunt 98% of the time on public hunting land, and you better have some type of cover scent or attracting scent. If you have ever had a bottle of estrus doe or doe pee spill in your back back, get on your hands, and even worse the floor board of your truck; I promise you will love the pee-willie wick. The top screws on and off, and it's a glass container which keeps the scent longer. All you have to do is put your favorite scent in the bottle and shack it up to cover the wick. When you go hunting just hang it from a tree, open the top, and un roll the wick."
5,They Love It,I bought this along with the sister for my two daughters and the second I got the batteries in they were in the tub. Both of my girls love them and we have had countless hours of fun in the tub. Makes it a lot easier to get them in the bath.
2,"cute, but doesn't swim",the doll is pretty but we were never able to actually get her to swim. I wouldn't bother buying her.
3,Decent Method for Tough Dogs,"Koehler method's are appropriate for dogs who are tough and forgiving. For dogs who are soft or unforgiving of aggressive methods (such as Doberman Pinschers, Border Collies and many other breeds) softer methods must be used for satisfactory results. This book is good to understand tracking theory but many may prefer to use another method to actually train their dog."
1,Disappointing,"Reflecting on environmental issues in the light of social structures is a great idea. The author's approach, though, is very disappointing. Bookchin keeps on telling us what things are not, but rarely gets to the point. Long descriptions and lists are what he does best, and that annoys me a lot. After a hundred and fifteen pages, I couldn't take it anymore and I dropped the book."
1,Grounded Adapter did not work,"When I plugged this into the wall at a hostel in London and then plugged a converter into it, I was not able to recieve power. When I plugged the same adapter into a different converter I was able to use my electronics. Unfortunately I can't return the adapter as I am studying abroad this semester. Other than that, I recieved it quickly and the packaging, while not extraordinary, was decent."
3,Annoying number of beeps,"I bought this because of the large display, not knowing that it would emit ""warning"" beeps at 5 and 3 minutes before the time I set it for. I am an adult who knows how to set a timer so I find these extra beeps annoying."
1,Don't be fooled!,"I was excited when I first saw that this was a touch screen timer. But very disappointed when I realized that its merely a flat keypad next to the LCD screen. There's nothing ""touch screen"" about this!!"
2,Dissapointed,My fault I assumed this CD had all the recordings from the movie but it does not.Do not assume check it out first
4,Song Help!,"First, the soundtrack to this movie is great. You can't beat tropical sounding eighties music.I've noticed there are a lot of people good at recognizing songs writing the reviews...Does anyone know what song was played during the commercials for the movie that went, ""blinded by the light"" with a cheesy keyboard sound??any posts of help would be great!"
5,Nice Soundtrack For A Nice Movie,"50 First Dates soundtrack is really good. I like how they got a newer generation of bands to do the older versions of the songs. I think adamsandler's ""Forgetfull Lucy"" make a nice addition to the soundtrack. If You liked the movie you'll like the soundtrack."
1,Not what I expected...,"I was really looking forward to hearing music like 311's remake of Love Song but all of it was reggae, it was horrible. Waste of my money so please DON'T WASTE YOURS!!!"
1,My ears now hate me,"I heard this in a record store last night and I threw up in my mouth a little. THis was honestly probably the worst concept and execution of a soundtrack in the history of recorded music. Some great songs have been absolutely slaughtered by terrible acts. If you buy this, you are pure garbage wrapped in skin. You have been warned."
4,Here's a Crazy Idea..,"How about reviewing the songs that are actually on the soundtrack.Amazing that so many one star reviews are based on what wasn't included.Go buy ""It's a Wonderful"" on iTunes and get a life.Overall a nice Reggae record of Eighties alt covers with ""Drive"" being the standout track.Ignore the psuedo ""reviews""."
2,Where's IZ?,"Good songs, the Adam Sandler ditty is cute, but where's IZ? The fabulous version of Over the Rainbow that closed the movie is MISSING! And it isn't revealed until you buy the album. Even then it's only revealed if you were expecting to hear it.I loved the movie and fully expected the soundtrack to be a complete version of the movie soundtrack. It was a disappointment for that track to be absent. It doesn't kill the CD, but the CD is less than it could have been both as a reflection of the movie and in terms of basic truth in advertising. This is not the complete movie soundtrack."
2,Somewhere over the rainbow,"I too was dissapointed that the ending song, ""Somewhere over the Rainbow was Missing"". I took a chance and went to the ITunes Music store and searched on Israel Kamakawiwo'ole and found the song there."
3,Re: Missing Songs that you gotta have!,"I loved the songs from the movie SO much that I purchased the soundtrack...oh dear.I have looked through all the comments and a big Bravo goes out to Webguddess, April 10 who has provided a list of the missing,very much desired songs.But she forgot one- No Doubt, Underneath It All. In case you can't find her comment here they are again, apart from that i do like the covered 80's songs on the CD:1.Wouldn't it be nice by The Beach Boys2.Another Day by Wings aka Paul McCartney3.Amber by 3114.Baby by Wyclef (during makeout in the office)5.Blinded By The Light by Manfred Mann(first look at Lucy)6.Do You Realize by Flaming Lips(Lucy's Car accident)7.Could You Be Loved by Bob Marley8.Hey Ya by Outkast9.Somewhere over The Rainbow by IZ (Israel Kamakawiwo'ole)10.Underneath It All by No DoubtHappy downloading!"
1,Where are the best songs?,"The soundtrack doesn't include the two best songs in the movie - and the two most relevant to the storyline: ""Wouldn't It Be Nice?"" by the Beach Boys and ""Over the Rainbow"" by IZ. These are probably my two favorite recordings of all time, and it made for a great ending to the movie. WHY AREN'T THEY ON THE ALBUM? Yet another reason why file sharing is stomping on the dessicated corpse of the music industry..."
3,Should have been a 2 CD set.,"Missing Songs as follows:14. ""Aloha Ka Manini"" - The Makaha Sons Of Ni'Ihau15. ""Could You Be Loved"" - Bob Marley & Wailers16. ""Throw Away The Gun"" O-Shen17. ""Pressure Drop"" - Toots & The Maytals18. ""Is This Love"" - Bob Marley & Wailers20.""My Little Grass Shack In Kealakekua Hawaii"" - Leon Redbone & Ringo Starr21.""My Sweet Sweet"" - The Maile Surenaders22.""Do You Realize!!"" - The Flaming Lips23. ""Rub A Dub"" - 31124. ""Another Day"" - Paul McCartney25. ""Amber"" - 31126. ""Underneath It All"" - No Doubt27. ""Hands Off She's Mine"" - English Beat28. ""Wouldn't it be nice"" - Beach Boys29. ""From Tha Chuuuch to da palace"" - Snoop Dogg30. ""Baby"" Wyclef Jean31. ""Over the Rainbow"" - Israel Kamakawiwo'ole32. ""Every Breath You Take"" - UB4033.. ""They Call the wind mariah"" - Harve Presnell"
1,Over the Rainbow.. Song,"As everyone else, its a shame they left out the good songs..but just in case, which Im sure many of you are looking for.. the version of Over the Rainbow in the movie, can be found onHawaiian Luau Party CD - The Hit Crew / releaseed 2007 / Label: Turn up the Music"
3,No IZ...........whats up with that??,Such a disgrace to omit IZ's 'Over the Rainbow' heard during closing credits on soundtrack!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,50 First Dates- ADVICE: READ SONG LIST BEFORE PURCHASING!,"One of my favorite movies! A little disappointed with Soundtrack. It did not have all the songs from the movie on it that I liked. My fault, I just assumed it would have All the songs from the movie- I didn't read the songs on the CD before I bought it! Still an ok CD."
4,If you want IZ buy Meet Joe Black or Finding Forrester,"As far as cover version compilations go this is a VERY good example. Not only do all the songs on the album fit together by the movie but all the originals fit in the same category. The only song that's 'out of place' is ""Forgetful Lucy"" but that's what makes this album the 50 First Dates Soundtrack and not a collection of re-done 80's love songs.Many other reviewers seem disappointed that IZ's ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow/Wonderful World"" isn't present on the soundtrack, but there is a reason for this! This is the third movie I know fo to feature the same song. They didn't put this one on there because it's probably already on the soundtracks to Meet Joe Black as well as Finding Forrester."
3,Found IZ - Somewhere Over the Rainbow on another soundtrack,"Too bad Somewhere Over the Rainbow not on this soundtrack, but I found it at Best Buy on the Meet Joe Black soundtrack. I needed this song for a wedding. Love this version of the song!"
1,Didn't have 'Over the Rainbow',I loved the movie and liked the songs that played during it.I decided to purchase the CD when I heard the song 'Over the Rainbow'. I noticed that the song is not on there!!! What was the CD maker thinking?? Now I will NOT be purchasing this CD.I think Amazon.com should contact the maker and let them know!!
2,Having not seen the movie...,"...this isn't very good at all.I bought the album because I love all those 80's tunes, and I like what 311 did with ""Love Song"" when I heard it on the radio.When evaluating remakes or cover versions, I ask myself two questions:1) does it honor the old version in a reinvigorating fashion (like No Doubt's ""It's My Life"")or2) does it recast the song in a fresh new light (like UB40's ""Red Red Wine"" or the English Beat's ""Tears Of A Clown""...both ""reggae/ska"" takes on their originals)Most of the versions here do neither. For the most part, they're a snooze, making you long for the original versions and won't have you seeking out more music from the new performers.If and when I see the film, perhaps I'll be more lenient, but strictly as a soundtrack, it's weak.(Having checked out some other reviews of this album, the songs left off sound more interesting than the ones here...)"
1,Ugh.,"Do you like the 80s? On the off chance you said yes, do you also like reggae? Would you like it if those two things were smashed together, and completely destroyed? Creating some (...)love-child that no one ever thought they wanted, this soundtrack is an atrocity. Not only does it provide a complete insult to the Cure (TWICE), but it also has poor Mark McGrath and 311 both choking out their own rendition of what they consider reggae. Most of the album is supposed to be love songs, but pretty much all I can muster after a few listens is apopleptic rage."
